","Precursor: I just moved back into town two days ago and had made plans to see one of my old friends tonight. I did not want to see this movie, and wouldn't have under any other circumstances but my friend really wanted to and the tickets were free so I went. <br/><br/>Review itself: This is of no disrespect to Jonah Hill, his fashion of humor or his fans at all, but I, personally have grown tired of what seems to now be a plethora of wanna be Hangover and Superbad's. (The success of Project X seriously worries me...). Anyways, having that mind set approaching tonight and considering the fact I didn't laugh once during the 21 JS trailer, green or red band... I really wasn't expecting all that much out of the experience aside from leaving the house and catching up with a buddy. <br/><br/>But damn. <br/><br/>I honestly thought this movie was great. Yes, there were parts I wasn't fond of... a bit of the dialogue seemed to me to be vulgar strictly for the sake of being vulgar... there was the usual expected Jonah Hill trademarked myriad of penis jokes and one extremely unnecessary shock gag but the majority of the movie was, to me, surprisingly satirical/smart/relevant in today's society, self-aware, and situationally hilarious. Even the dumbest and most profane of this movie's jokes and clichés seemed to know that they were such and were given the proper comedic build up/context to at least warrant a chuckle. This movie had some surprisingly clever dialogue throughout and some of the best supporting characters I've seen in recent comedies (Ice Cube, The Principal, etc..) What really stood out to me though was the editing. 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration. Despite it's faults, I found this to be a damn hard movie to hate, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun weekend movie.<br/><br/>All in all... genuine, clever, vulgar yet respectable comedy with some heart. <br/><br/>IMO a very good career move for both Hill and Tatum. <br/><br/>Stoked for the sequel."

","Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.<br/><br/>Based on a TV series of the same name which aired on Fox Network between 1987 and 1991, the series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. The 2012 movie adaptation also had the former cast of the series; Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise play a minor role.<br/><br/>Written by Jonah Hill who also starred in it, 21 is a movie that suits a cinema viewing with a box of popcorn at your side. Hill's performance was on a mild okay side, but the main cheese in the movie was Channing Tatum, who transcended from a jock to a nerd and still maintained his persona. I guess the most fun I had was when I saw Ice – Cube talking to the duo.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). The directors and writers made sure you didn't have to go see the original to get the full taste of 21, as the film made do of the current pop culture in our time and how ironic and dumb it looks to make a fun movie and enough juice left to make another.<br/><br/>21 makes fun of everything in its path, even down to drugs, and how we kept expecting things to blow up and they just don't. The jokes keeps coming in from every corner making you laugh although.<br/><br/>The high moments in the movie was whenever the duo were together, the low moment was when they were apart.<br/><br/>The plot had the duo Hill and Tatum as Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko (respectively), get deployed as undercover cops to a high school to bust a drug ring, and everything you'd expect to happen, doesn't. That's the fun of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, why are you wasting time reading this go watch it."
"JeanRalphio","9","137","215","18 March 2012"," Best Comedy so far of 2012
","So if you like Jonah Hill and comedies with really great cameo appearances, I think you would definitely like this film.<br/><br/>I must admit I expected this to be at the same standard as maybe The Change-Up or The Hangover Part II which weren't terrible movies, but they weren't the funniest movies I have seen either. This movie is more on par with The Hangover (the first installment), Superbad and Anchorman.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it's nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com or ""rom"" setting. I was already laughing from the first scene, which is generally hard to do and the humour was the correct balance of wit and slapstick. There were actually a lot more clever jokes than I expected and there were some scenes were I couldn't even control my laughter in a full cinema.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm not saying this movie is for everyone but the way I would tell you to see it is if you like Jonah Hill's ridiculous dialogue with sometimes unnecessary swears and you have no expectations of it being anything like the original TV show, I would definitely recommend this one! Best comedy film I've seen at the cinema in 2012."
"nicecardigan","10","153","254","16 February 2012"," Funniest Movie I've Seen In a While
","I have never seen the original 21 Jump Street series so I can't compare. I had only watched the trailer and thought it looked alright, but wasn't planning on paying to see it. I received free advance screening passes to see it last night and I am so glad! It is honestly the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I usually don't laugh out loud but this movie had me (and the rest of the audience) laughing at least every ten seconds.<br/><br/>Who knew Channing Tatum could be so funny? He really steals the show half the movie with his great comedic timing. The back-and-forth that he and Jonah Hill have is so refreshing. They have clear comedic chemistry and play off of each other very well. The dialogue is fresh and hilarious. Another standout actor was Dave Franco. I am a big fan of him and have always found him funny, and he really shines in this movie. Overall, every actor played off the next very well. It's clear they had a great time making this movie.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this enough. If you want a good laugh, then SEE THIS. It has clever, outrageous comedy and some great acting. There was a great cameo surprise towards the end that had the entire theater gasping and laughing. This is one of the few movie experiences I've had where the entire audience enjoyed themselves and laughed out loud, even clapped at some parts. Go see it, you will not regret it!"
"brendanrmorrow","9","113","186","17 March 2012"," Unexpectedly hilarious and clever. 21 Jump Street subverts all expectations.
","21 Jump Street sounds like a terrible idea on paper: a big screen adaptation of an ABC TV series from the 80s. Was anyone really clamoring for that? Was there any reason to adapt that into a feature film in 2012? It sounds like just another example of Hollywood cashing in on an established franchise, akin to the decision to make a movie based on the board game Battleship. As it turns out 21 Jump Street is barely an adaptation, and it isn't just an excuse to capitalize on an old concept. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind the brilliant and absurd Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, use the fact that nobody is too invested in the source material to their advantage, subverting all expectations for what a movie like this would be. The result is a smart, exciting and often hilarious action-comedy with real stakes and a surprising amount of heart.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as Schmidt and Jenko respectively, two rookie cops who went to high school together, though belonging to different social circles. Jenko was the popular jock while Schmidt was the unpopular nerd. When they realize each has something the other one needs, a friendship sparks and they become partners. After a failed drug bust, they're reassigned to a special division when their police station decides to ""revive a cancelled program from the 80s"" (get it?). They're sent to a local high school undercover as students to investigate and bring down a drug ring. Despite identical titles, I don't know if we can even call this an adaptation of the show. While the TV show was primarily a drama, the film is essentially a satire of movies and shows like 21 Jump Street, fully aware of all of the clichés of its genre. <br/><br/>Writer Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) seems to have realized nobody really cared about a 21 Jump Street movie and instead decided to make something totally different. Early on, in a scene of dialogue that may as well have been delivered directly into the camera, a character explains that there aren't any original ideas these days and so we're stuck rehashing old concepts from the 80s to make a quick buck. In this way and many others, the movie is all about subverting your expectations, which based on this premise are probably very low. It's anything but a lazy cash grab, taking everything you know about buddy cop films and turning it on its head. It embraces the stupidity of its concept too, by constantly acknowledging that Hill and Tatum are way too old to be posing as high school kids, or by having Ice Cube play the stereotypical black police captain from every 80s movie ever, and then outright acknowledging that. In a hilarious early scene Schmidt and Jenko's roles are reversed, with the jock forced to pose as the nerd and the nerd posing as the jock. 21 Jump Street thrives on the unexpected.<br/><br/>Many were initially unsure how Channing Tatum would perform, as he is an actor who has never headlined in any major comedies before. While Jonah Hill is without a doubt the star, having had tons of experience in films like Superbad and Knocked Up, Tatum does a fine job as well and the two actors have great chemistry together. In movies like this with two main leads, the rapport between them can make or break the film. With 21 Jump Street, it absolutely makes it.<br/><br/>That's ultimately why the movie works as well as it does. Any successful comedy needs real stakes. Otherwise, it just feels like a series of Saturday Night Live sketches with no real purpose. A few years ago, Superbad was extremely successful not just for being a goofy and raunchy comedy, but also for having a believable high school friendship at its core. Similarly, 21 Jump Street works because the friendship between its protagonists feels real, and as a result there are real emotional stakes to go along with the satire. Driving this silly, raunchy comedy is a truly interesting story about popularity and friendship in high school, and about how you might act differently if you could go back as an adult. It's easily the funniest comedy in well over a year, but it's not just a vehicle for jokes: 21 Jump Street tells a great story, too.<br/><br/>Phil Lord and Chris Miller seem to love surprising us. As with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street is a movie nobody expected to be great. Its brilliance lies in the fact that it knows all of your complaints ahead of time. Think it sounds like a cheap cash crab based on an 80s property? They make a joke about that. Think Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are too old to play high school kids? They make a joke about that too. It's extremely clever and always two steps ahead of the audience. But what really stands out about 21 Jump Street is that it's not just an enjoyable and hilarious time at the theater, it also tells a genuinely interesting and emotionally compelling story, developing its characters in a way you probably wouldn't anticipate from a raunchy high school comedy."
"billygoat1071","8","51","86","4 May 2012"," Fun In High School
","The TV series of 21 Jump Street is always remembered as one of Johnny Depp's early performances. The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance, this movie looks like it's just another mediocre raucous comedy, but it turns out to be a clever one. It's quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It's a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's better than the TV series though. Both are pretty interesting but this one is definitely aiming as a comedy. The film is just crazy stuff with crazy characters living in an absurd setting. The original premise remains but with some buddy comedy elements, and raunchy and slapstick humor. Surprisingly, it works better to the plot. The humor is clever and quite hilarious. These jokes are greatly executed by the stars. Jonah Hill is always a brilliant comedian. Channing Tatum finally plays a none bland character. His chemistry with Hill shines to the film. While the others, Ice Cube hams it up a little but he can provide some laughs. Rob Riggle is just being Rob Riggle. Dave Franco's role here kind of reminds me of his role in Fright Night but he's pretty good with it.<br/><br/>The direction is snappy and stylish. The action is fun but I don't think anybody cares about that. The main point of this film is High School and the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko. It shows how the new high school turned their lives upside down. They can't stop playing with their antics on their mission. There is a drama between them. Most of it played as a joke but the heart is always there.<br/><br/>All turns out to be pretty well in this film even with all the changes and the absurdity. It's smart, sweet, hilarious, and fun. The fans of the TV series may still get a surprise while they miss the none mad Captain Jenko and the charms of the show. This film is too crazy and absurd but in a clever way. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this in a while. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it's probably one of the best comedies of the year."
"zzoaozz","2","61","107","26 March 2012"," Gets Old Fast (spoilers)
","This movie seems to be confused as to whether it was supposed to be an action movie or a comedy and fails to achieve either. It isn't really very funny at all and it drags too much to be exciting. It has other problems as well. <br/><br/>The jokes try to hard to be hip and end up being just plays on stereotypes. For example, in a misguided attempt to look cool one of the characters punches a guy for being nerdy. The victim mistakenly believes he was punched because he is black and gay which makes the cop look uncool. In another example, throughout the movie the head of the jump street program acts like a stereotypical bad tempered black cop, even calling himself that. It is vaguely amusing the first time, but the next umpteen times it gets a little lame as do the frequent jokes about the guys not looking like teenagers. The visual and verbal humor are like this through the whole movie. <br/><br/>The movie portrays alcohol and drug use as a funny joke. It shows scenes of the cops high on the supposedly deadly drug they are supposed to be in high school stopping. It shows them buying booze for an underage party and it's supposed to be funny because they have to use false IDs. It shows them stealing marijuana from the evidence lockup to share with the kids. I know it's a comedy not a message movie, but this is just not funny. To top it off, they don't even get reprimanded for any of the illegal things they do from giving drugs to minor to engaging in a high speed chase on a freeway, to reckless discharge of firearms, to taking further police actions when technically fired. <br/><br/>The action is boring. The interminably long scenes of bicycle, car, and limousine chases do not even begin to liven up this bomb. They are not interesting. <br/><br/>The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops. <br/><br/>I used to watch the 21 Jump Street series and it was a serious drama about serious issues like homosexual bullying, drugs, suicide, and peer pressure. It may have been a little soap operish at times, but it was dramatic and interesting. I think it deserved more respect than this."
"Turfseer","4","46","79","4 April 2012"," Few laughs in this 'Animal House meets Lethal Weapon' misfire
","Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.<br/><br/>For example, when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings, or even worse, when Jenko fires his gun in the park, after tackling a bad guy, these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about, after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors, the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party, anyway?; not to mention the confiscated marijuana they take from the police property room place, without authorization.<br/><br/>The joke is supposed to be that in reality Schmidt and Jenko are really glorified fraternity members, who just happen to have jobs as police officers. Where I could definitely buy a bunch of 'loose cannon' fraternity members in a film like 'Animal House', where one demented group is pitted against a 'straight' one, it doesn't really work in the police setting, since as stated above, improprieties are simply not tolerated.<br/><br/>While a good deal of the humor of '21 Jump Street' is juvenile in nature, on one occasion it veers into the area of being quite vile. This is near film's end when the bad guy is castrated and somehow, we're ask to laugh when viewing the scene of his detached member. No it's not funny and I hope word gets around that this is the kind of gross 'humor', Hill and his fellow scenarists are trying to peddle.<br/><br/>No need to recount all the details of the plot. Suffice it to say, that Schmidt and Jenko are on a mission to take down assorted bad guys who have been selling a new 'designer drug' in the school. It's your typical buddy movie where Schmidt is the nerd with a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko, and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt, out of his shell.<br/><br/>Actually, it's the bad guys, who really keep the story moving along. There's 'Eric', the eco-friendly big man on campus who moonlights as a drug dealer, and his supplier, Mr. Walters, a physical education teacher, whose goofy demeanor masks a huge anger management problem. To top it off, an assorted bunch of nasties, consisting of bikers and gang members, led by the menacing 'Domingo', lend an air of verisimilitude, not found in the antics of the principals, Jenko and Schmidt.<br/><br/>Occasionally, there are a few amusing bits in '21 Jump' including trucks filled with gasoline that fail to explode as well as some funny hallucinations which we get to see, when the protagonists are forced to take drugs in order not to blow their cover. But on the whole, Jonah Hill and co-writer Michael Bacall's frat-boy humor, lacks subtlety and relies on low-level slapstick routines, to get by. At this point, America is so desperate for something humorous in the movies these days, that a mediocre exercise such as this, is hailed as a comic masterpiece!"
"markthetranny","1","80","151","17 March 2012"," 21 junk street
","An honest review. I can't understand why there are certain people who constantly hype this movie on the IMDb and criticise other better movies. I guess they must be paid to do so. Certainly seems plausible since I've now watched this crapfest. How bad is it? Do you remember the abysmal Ben Stiller butchering of Starsky and Hutch from a while back. 21 Jump Street is worse than that. Hardly surprising given that it stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. I've only seen Tatum in one movie before and he was a wooden, dull, boring plank in that. He's no better in this. As a leading man he's even more of a charisma vacuum than Chris O'Donnell.<br/><br/>Still at least he's better than Jonah Hill. Superbad wasn't just the title of his breakthrough movie its a description of his entire career.<br/><br/>He's been doing the same schtick in everything he does and if it was rubbish the first time it stinks like month old festering garbage now.<br/><br/>To make it clear I'm a fan of gross out stupid comedy but not when its as stupid and badly-acted as this. Don't pay to see this. The good reviews are fake. You'll thank me for the warning."
"witster18","7","70","131","22 March 2012"," yeah, I was just like you
","I too expected this to stink. Another buddy cop movie, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, based on a lousy 80's television show - doesn't sound all that appealing.<br/><br/>Hill's ""The Sitter"", completely mediocre, and it's been quite a while since Superbads success. <br/><br/>Channing Tatum showed his comedic timing during his appearance on SNL. I was still hesitant.<br/><br/>But, I stand corrected.<br/><br/>This is the funniest movie since last years' Bridesmaids.<br/><br/>The key here is the fantastic script. The story isn't rocket-science, and we knew it wouldn't be, but the comedic timing of the leads is spot-on, and they were given a great script to work with.<br/><br/>I found myself laughing multiple times throughout. My spouse concurred. One late, unnecessary gross-out moment brought it down a notch. The film hadn't used any of those gimmicks and didn't need to in the end. It just seemed a bit out of place and distasteful.<br/><br/>The leads did a great job here. Their characters worked exactly how they should in a buddy-cop flick like this. They bounced off each other for an hour and a half, and the result will surely be one of the best comedies of the year, and an outside shot for my 2012 top-25(back-end)if it can hold-on.<br/><br/>Watch out for a sneaky cameo(spoiled by the cast list if you look).<br/><br/>Nice surprise.<br/><br/>Deserves it's ranking here.<br/><br/>Stuck between 7-8, but going with 76/100, so I'm rounding to 8.<br/><br/>You'll enjoy this if you liked:The Other Guys, Starsky and Hutch, If Looks Could Kill, or Blue Streak - even though I think this is actually a clear notch above all of those films."

","On the surface, this movie looks like it would be somewhat mediocre. But it's actually pretty damn good. When you're not laughing your pants off (and believe me, you will be), you'll have no problem being just plain entertained by it's ability to just have fun. It does a great job of not only avoiding giant cliché's, but making fun of them in the process. Jonah Hill will have you laughing, and Channing Tatum actually did a good job in this movie.......not surprising seeing that the role called for him to be a douche bag. Which once again, is something to chuckle about. Towards the end, the movie does tend to drag on, but has no problem pulling you right back into it's fun.

","I liked the original show. I knew that this movie wouldn't be as good. I wasn't prepared for how horrible it was. If I had my own car with me I would have walked out. They took what was good about the show and threw it away. The movie is set in present day, over 20 years after the original show aired. It has Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum go undercover in a school to stop the flow of a new type of drug.<br/><br/>The cops break every law there is. At one point they teabag a criminal. They also break into the evidence room and steal some weed, give alcohol to minors, and consume drugs. <br/><br/>There were very few female characters, most didn't have names. The cast was almost completely white-washed. They used the word bitch way too often and I felt offended. Even the cameos from Johnny Depp, Holly Robinson Peete, and Peter DeLuise fell flat. <br/><br/>I wish I had those two hours of my life back."
"bill-jason","1","91","181","11 April 2012"," Was this supposed to be funny??
","The movie version of ""21 Jump Street"" was supposed to be a comedy, I guess. And I guess you would think it's funny if you love the same old jokes about penises over and over from beginning of the movie to the very end, literally.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was going to show how two older, wiser guys go back to high school as undercover cops, and show those young kids what's up. THAT would have been interesting. Instead, they go right back to how they were as kids, bumbling and fumbling their way along, and doing a LOT of stupid things as well.<br/><br/>The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops.<br/><br/>The original 21 Jump Street with Johnny Depp was a good show. The movie version with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was just dumb, sorry.<br/><br/>This is easily Tatum's worst film, and I can't stand Jonah Hill. Hill is not funny, just annoying, and it makes sense that he co-wrote the script.<br/><br/>You can tell Hill has no idea what a cool person is actually like, so he throws in about a hundred penis jokes, along with the usual drug and sexual comments, which take no imagination or creativity at all.<br/><br/>Big time bomb."

If you like the series, don't watch this, something will happen that ruins the old classic, just avoid.

Also lots of stereotypes. I found it a bit weird that the only time you see Tatum being ""aggressive"" is when he is talking to and then later subjugating in a vulgar sexual manner an African American male while in police uniform. He is also seen later to punch in the face another African American male who turns out to be gay.<br/><br/>Overall a crap waste of time thats filled with racial and sexual content."

","I'll make this short and sweet as I'm not even sure IMDb will allow me to post a review of what may be seen as a minority opinion.<br/><br/>Aside from being overall a waste of time and not funny, what really disgusted me is there are a ton of crude gay oral sex references in this film. Literally, it's as if the writers were paid on a 100% commission to insert as many explicit and implicit gay oral jokes or innuendo into the film as possible. The film projects the image that virtually most of the characters in the film harbor gay urges. I've noticed this self deprecating punch line is being inserted into quite a bit of comedies. <br/><br/>Spoilers: The scene towards the end where the one character has his privates shot off and then has to pick it up with his mouth because he is handcuffed is revolting, disgusting, not funny and should have never made it past the censors. In an earlier scene a character makes a crack about forcing another to wear a snorkel mask and that they will then defecate into it. This is not funny, it's disgusting and sophomoric at best. <br/><br/>In closing, Hollywood please stop with the disgusting bathroom humor and the relentless gay agenda. Also, knock it off with the fake reviews on here, there's no way this piece of garbage is a 7.6, me personally i would give it zero stars if i could,but i would bet without the fake reviews this would rate a 4.0 Same with that sleep inducing garbage from last year: ""Drive""."

","I wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the original series and so thought I'd give this a shot since it was available on one of my OnDemand channels. As I see it, the single biggest problem with this movie is that it was Rated R; so the people who are the correct age to enjoy this thing are not old enough to view it, and those that are old enough to watch it will not enjoy it. I will admit I laughed two or three times, but the boring times in between them far outweighed those tiny chuckles. <br/><br/>This movie repeated commits the greatest sin, that is people not reacting to events like a reasonably intelligent, poorly educated person might. Every character in this thing is dumber than a bag rocks, the dialog is awful, and the plot is incoherent. Had I gone to the cinema to watch this dog, I would have been force to walk out before the halfway mark, and demand my money back. <br/><br/>I promise I will die before I watch another movie, TV show, or video in which Jonah Hill had anything to do with the writing or production. The fact that so many people liked it, and wrote glowing reviews is either evidence that some people are paid to right false good reviews, or it is a further sign our civilization is rapidly approaching its ultimate demise due to the unfathomable inanity of the average voter."

He puts on the same braces that Ben Stiller wore in ""Something About Mary"" a far better comedy.

","I saw the advance screening of this movie and I don't understand why they took such an iconic series and turned it into trash. Tatum was lifeless and dull, and to be quite frank I don't think he commands an on screen presence to hold even a supporting role in a movie. He ruined GI Joe for me and countless fans and a few other movies I had expectations of. As for Jonah Hill his B grade comedy skills should be left out of Hollywood. They don't fit in this movie or this genre for that matter. Honestly, I wouldn't waste money watching this movie, its not worth even 30 minutes of your time. This was a failed attempt at capturing a series that Johnny Depp personified and its extremely sad that it was butchered into a cheap storyline with the sole intention of making money."

","The movie version of ""21 Jump Street"" was supposed to be a comedy, I guess. And I guess you would think it's funny if you love the same old jokes about penises over and over from beginning of the movie to the very end, literally.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was going to show how two older, wiser guys go back to high school as undercover cops, and show those young kids what's up. THAT would have been interesting. Instead, they go right back to how they were as kids, bumbling and fumbling their way along, and doing a LOT of stupid things as well.<br/><br/>The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops.<br/><br/>The original 21 Jump Street with Johnny Depp was a good show. The movie version with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was just dumb, sorry.<br/><br/>This is easily Tatum's worst film, and I can't stand Jonah Hill. Hill is not funny, just annoying, and it makes sense that he co-wrote the script.<br/><br/>You can tell Hill has no idea what a cool person is actually like, so he throws in about a hundred penis jokes, along with the usual drug and sexual comments, which take no imagination or creativity at all. Disgusting unfunny filth,better to step away this mess."

","I did not see this movie in the theaters and now I can honestly say I am really glad I didn't. After watching the DVD, I am still trying to figure out what the appeal is of this film. Is it Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum..? It does not make sense.<br/><br/>But for Bruno Wang, the most glaring aspect of this film, the one that makes it tank for me, is the fact that the film centers around a couple of oddly opposite misfits who wind up working for an undercover unit of the police department to infiltrate a synthetic drug ring and stop the drugs from spreading from one high school to many in the community. So the logic here is that drugs are bad, right? However, the movie then proceeds to glamorize the drug (HFS-which stands for Holy F*ing Sh*t) and shows 60s Batman-like graphics of the different phases of the drug's effects. Even more twisted is that one of the students dies after taking HFS. This is supposed to be funny?<br/><br/>The movie is based on the TV series and the plot is weak. Two guys, now in their mid 20s, who were at opposite ends of the social spectrum in high school (one a jock and one a nerd), meet back up again in police academy training where they figure out that their strong traits can help each other overcome their weaknesses and get them to pass the academy. Jonah Hill plays the nerd, Schmidt and Channing Tatum plays the jock, Jenko. Jenko helps Schmidt with the physical part of the training and Schmidt helps Jenko with the bookwork. Together they succeed in passing the academy where they are immediately assigned as park cops riding bicycles. In the park, they witness drug usage and wind up capturing one of the criminals but neglect to read him his Miranda rights. The screw up has them being reassigned to an undercover crime unit, 21 Jump Street. They are chosen for this because they have 'youthful looks' and supposedly will fit into a high school unnoticed. <br/><br/>The two wind up going back to their original high school posing as brothers and living in Schmidt's parents house. From here the movie is a strange mix of violence, drug humor and just bad plot. Schmidt and Jenko wind up accidentally trading identities while under the influence of HFS and now Jenko has to cut it with the nerds and Schmidt is hanging with the cool kids. The twist is that now the 'cool' kids are not the jocks, but the ones who are environmentalists and activists...and, in this case, also drug dealers.<br/><br/>Schmidt and Jenko are supposed to find the supplier of the drug before the drug spreads. After one massive failure after another they do eventually discover that it is the PE teacher, played by Rob Riggle. Riggle's role is the most unbelievable of all and really waters the film down. We have this half-cocked PE teacher who supposedly stumbles on to a formula for a synthetic drug and he now is supposedly dealing with underworld figures and guns etc.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a love interest, Schmidt is supposedly falling for one of the high school girls, Molly, who is in with the 'in' crowd in which Eric, played by Dave Franco. But again, here's a plot twist that is borderline sick, e.g., a 20 something guy hitting on a high school chick? <br/><br/>There is also a cameo appearance by original 21 Jump Street DEA Agents Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise) near the end of the film. Sadly, this is one film that not even Johnny Depp can save. The whole film is just a disturbingly bad amount of really stupid humor and, pretty much, unbelievable plot line. It leaves you feeling a little numb and dumb. I give this movie a Bruno Wang 1.5 stars out of 5. The laughs are few and far between and the plot appears written by a thirteen year old."

It brought up subjects that kids dealt with. They did blow up cars or destroy a city. This should not have been called 21 Jump Street. Another thing mostly everyone in the REAL 21 Jump Street looked sexy and young. Neither the two guys in this show even looked their age. They both looked fat, ugly, annoying and pathetic. Also Hanson and Duggy would not have been killed at the end of the movie. They wouldn't have been that pathetic to look away while apprehending criminals. I think if someone stupid says this is good they need to go back and watch the REAL 21 Jump Street then can talk. Hanson and Duggy brought down kids in school with class and dignity not destruction and degrading ways. Why must they say the F word thru the entire movie, every second. I mean come on. This could have been a better movie if they had actually watched 21 Jumpstreet. Also those kids they had in school does not fit how kids are now.

","Usually the IMDb ratings are a fair assessment of the quality of a movie, at least when a seizable amount of viewers have taken part. Of course there is a lot of pressure from the movies producers to bias the results. When films have a small samples this is sometimes the case. You get the impression here that somehow, someone has managed to do this here in spite of the largish amount of people that have somehow taken part. The movie itself is trash, unoriginal and in spite of the cameo appearances decisively unfunny. It is unlikely that anyone that has a modicum of common sense can see this production and think that is anything but a larger budget run of the mill B movie. Do not waste your time and money after it. What you see in the trailer is just about it."

","'21 Jump Street' is a largely forgotten late 80s/early 90s television show, which today is widely acknowledged for helping launch the career of actor Johnny Depp, who you made of heard of. Having not seen a single episode of the program (which was before my time), could I make it through this film with a complete understanding without any backstory? <br/><br/>Let me get one thing straight: unlike the show (which deals with such heavy issues as child abuse, homophobia, AIDS, and hat crimes), this is a raunchy comedy. And the movie's not afraid to admit it, as the first ten minutes alone provide us with a galore of genitalia and gross out gags. Normally, these would scare me away and become a liability when considering how one movie would score. Maybe it's the fact that the funniest moments stem from witty banter or creative sequences rather than gross out themselves, but it the raunchiness didn't seem to bother me (for the most part.) <br/><br/>Then there's Channing Tatum. If you were to bring his name up anytime before this year, I would shutter.I mean, we all know he might not have the greatest resume ('Fighting' anyone?), but he's honestly one of the best things about this movie. So much so that he even manages to be better than Jonah Hill, one of the best comedic actors working today. Rob Riggle and Ice Cube each provide inspired supporting roles that are nearly laugh out loud funny each time they're on screen, never feeling forced or overused.<br/><br/>Does the film have problems? Well...yeah. I won't deny that. Some of the jokes fall flat, while some jokes that initially worked are stretched a little too far. There's the (inevitably) love story between one of the main characters and a high school girl feels too forced and only is there to serve as a 'love story.' But, for the most part, I completely enjoyed it, though I can't ever see myself taking time to watch it again.<br/><br/>So if turning a serious-themed show like '21 Jump Street' into a very good raunchy comedy does make me wonder if other old 80s TV shows would make a similar transition. Wouldn't Alf as a pot-smoking, potty-mouthed slacker who still lives with his mom in modern day Los Angeles be an instant classic?"

Thankfully, yes: Channing and Jonah have zero chemistry, which I can attribute to their combined lack of acting talent and a probable dislike for each other (Jonah and Channing hangin' out after a day shooting? Not likely).<br/><br/>I also like a good laugh like the next guy, but please: at least try not to force my tongue into my cheek at gunpoint.

","What do the movies ""Jack and Jill"" and ""Batman and Robin"" have in common? Two things. One, they are both considered to be some of the worst films to ever plague cinema. Two, they are both better than ""21 Jump Street"". ""21 Jump Street"" is a comedy film loosely based around a TV show running from the late 80s to the early 90s. While the TV show had heart and thought put into it, the film version disregards the original to throw in as much juvenile humor, stupid characters, unfunny jokes, and desperate attempts at comedy it has. <br/><br/>The film starts off with our two main characters in high school. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) is an awkward nerd while Jenko (Channing Tatum) is a jock who picks on Schmidt. Cut to a few years later where both of them are in the police academy and discover that their weaknesses are the other one's strength. A relationship forms between the two based around the fact that the two are using each other and we skip past the building of their friendship in a montage of Schmidt helping Jenko in the academic field while Jenko helps Schmidt in the physical field. The montage brings us to their graduation where they are welcomed into the police force and they are now good friends because of events we never witness. They are placed on park patrol and come across a group of drug dealers. They capture one of them but due to incompetence, the police have to let the dealer go and Schmidt and Jenko are reassigned to an old police program located at 21 Jump Street.<br/><br/>At 21 Jump Street, the two meet Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who reveals to them that they have been chosen because of their youthful appearance, and from what earlier scenes tell the audience because they are incompetent. The duo are sent into a high school to investigate a drug ring where they get their identities mixed up and have to go to the other one's classes. Schmidt is put into a drama class where he meets a girl named Molly (Brie Larson) and later becomes friends with a popular kid named Eric (Dave Franco). As the mission continues, Schmidt becomes more interested in being popular and being in high school than he does on cracking down on the drug dealers, which in turn causes a split between him and Jenko.<br/><br/>The characters of Schmidt and Jenko are the overall largest problem with the movie. They are unfunny, unlikable, and they are incompetent. All we know about their relationship is the fact that they became friends based around the fact that they were using each other, then we see a montage of them working together, and then they are suddenly best friends. To add insult to injury, there is no chemistry between the two. A problem with their characters is their arcs exist for lame jokes and that they make them look even more incompetent. Schmidt having trouble firing a weapon is a little acceptable but Jenko's inability to remember his Miranda Rights makes him look dumber and makes the police force look stupid to allow someone like that to stay on the force. I thought that at the end of the movie they would learn a few things and mature. What does the film do instead? Throw out a perfect opportunity for real and interesting character development in place for a stupid, unfunny, and disgusting penis joke.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie is at the lowest form of comedy and it is all desperate. Ellie Kemper, who is funny on ""The Office"" as Erin, portrayed Jenko's chemistry teacher and was only around for a cheap joke about how she was attracted to Jenko who was supposedly a student. One thing that really bugs me is that some of the comedic moments in this movie are things I would normally find funny, but this film takes what I like and turns it into another annoyance for me. Unfunny and just plain desperate for laughs, ""21 Jump Street"" sinks to use some of the most juvenile humor I have ever witnessed. How come Adam Sandler and his movies are criticized for having juvenile humor but then this movie gets appraise from critics and the general audience?<br/><br/>Of all the movies I have seen, this is the one that I regret watching the most. Watching this film was a depressing and aggravating experience that did nothing but make me lose trust in my friend's opinions who suggested this movie to me. Horrible, unfunny, unlikable, stupid, and obnoxious characters, a story that makes the audience route for incompetence, completed with an overall horrible script and unfunny jokes, ""21 Jump Street"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and it does nothing but causes me anger. While the late and great Roger Ebert said this about another movie, it applies to me here, ""I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it."" (Roger Ebert, ""North"" review). There are not enough negative words in the world to describe what this piece of garbage is."

","This is basically a film version of an 80's TV series that kick started Johnny Depp's career. It's about two rubbish cops (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) going into a police program to pretend to be in high school so to infiltrate a drugs ring that's killed a kid in the school.<br/><br/>NOW STOP, no not hammertime but don't worry. I know that sounds like a very rubbish stupid comedy film but very early on makes you realise it knows its stupid when the guy in charge of the operation explains something about the program to the two cops, I quote ""a revived undercover program from the '80s, revamped for modern times; the people who make these things up are old and out of ideas, so they try updating (stuff) like this and hope we don't notice"". See now that line shows you that it realises its no top notch film and that it is just in it for the ride with a few laughs.<br/><br/>First and foremost yes it is funny, which is a relief as about 3/4 of films that label themselves ""comedy"" really just arn't. It has some pretty silly gags sometimes but these are outweighed by the tonnes of good jokes and are really insignificant in comparison to 1 or 2 of the fantastic lines in the film. The film isn't too plot heavy which is good as it adds realism to the pair and allows them to branch out to allow some story with the side characters, which stops too many sight gags and fart jokes being used as filler.<br/><br/>Looking at Channing Tatum's IMDb page (I don't think I've seen many of his films) he seems to be in mainly rom-coms and what are essentially girly movies. In this though he is really quite good, he doesn't overplay his character which may be due to him coming from a more straight up film background. The way he delivers his lines isn't cheesy and he gives his character a realistic portrayal while still being hilarious at times. Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill which doesn't need any more on it and the side characters and pretty funny with a good cameo right at the end.<br/><br/>It has that problem all Hollywood comedy's have of having a sad bit 3/4 the way through the film, which by the way one of my favourite comedies - pineapple express - does not, but I can't really bring it down too much for as it's probably forced to include it by the company behind the film. It's also a touch long but neither of these things take away from what is a good self-mickey-taking comedy film.<br/><br/>7/10.

I feel sorry for the people who have never seen the original Jump Street series with Johnny Depp. This movie isn't ANYTHING like the original and I think it's a disgrace they even got the rights to do this. In the original, the Jump Street detectives are just there because of their youthful looks, not because they were incompetent morons! The overall theme was of drama, although there was the obvious comic moments shared between the cast. The original also raised important social/political issues of the time (AIDS, homosexuality, child abuse, bullying ,gang violence, abortion, sexual violence) and tried to deal sensitively with the stigma of these issues and 'educate' the masses, whose ignorant, racist, sexist (and whatever 'ist' is left) attitudes held our society back. In a way the show tried to 'right' some of the 'wrongs' our self-centered society had created, it didn't glorify it. I love comedy as much as anyone, but this rubbish just mocked the original show and only serves to justify the current B-S lives people wallow in! And I'm sure this hasn't addressed any of the racist/sexist issues we STILL experienced. Boy, haven't we evolved???"

I will say, however, that the movie started off well and was quite funny, but once the two cops entered high school, it all went down hill! Most of the jokes were inappropriate and I'm not saying that inappropriate jokes aren't funny it's just that they were basically the same joke over and over again and it got old very quickly.

","You would not believe it even if you saw it with your own eyes. A sober Irishman? A thin Greek? A game-sealing shot by Lebron in the fourth? Even rarerit's a half-decent reboot! A reimagining of the more serious 1980s young adult crime drama of the same name, 21 Jump Street lends a comedic touch to the otherwise dreary world of underground drug trafficking. Starring an odd couple with a difference in Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, the film mostly follows the standard buddy-cop formula but deviates enough to both keep your interest and produce a handful of laughs.<br/><br/>Seven years ago, two kids on opposite ends of the social spectrum graduated from high school. The popular Jenko (actor's name omitted for obviousness) and overweight, nerdy Schmidt (same here) both enrol in the local police force and form a friendship, helping each other pass the course. Now fully-fledged police officers, the clueless duo are kicked out of the force and into a top-secret program, where younger-looking officers are again enrolled in high school in order to bring down a syndicated drug ring.<br/><br/>By a long margin, the film's best quality is its willingness to make fun of itself. Granted, the backbone of the plot is predictable enough, but gag-wise, this movie has its moments. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs) take pleasure in playing off cemented audience expectations (that is, a few laughs, a gunfight or two and a couple of explosions) before even the first trailer has begun, and subsequently subverting these conventions wherever they see fit.<br/><br/>Essentially, they refuse to play by the rules, which can be comedy gold when used correctly. A rogue motorbike spitting sparks across the freeway collides with an oil tanker and nothing happens. That same bike runs into a pickup truck carrying a load of chickens and a deafening explosion ensues. The irony of having a man who once made a generous living badmouthing authority play a typically surly, by-the-book cop isn't lost on most, and it is Ice Cube's sheer assertion of himself as a stereotype that makes the role work. The cameos by a couple of members of the original series are good fun too.<br/><br/>Speaking of making roles work, Hill reverts back to his Superbad roots with his performance, but it is Tatum who is surprisingly funny as the dim-witted do-gooder Jenko. Just when it looks like he has become irreversibly typecast as either an action hero or soppy teen idol, he comes up big in a comedy, impressing with his stone-faced delivery and interplay with his far more comedically experienced co-star. While under the influence in a certain scene, Tatum utters the film's funniest one-liner, and a quote sure to be repeated in many a school and university from now on.<br/><br/>That said, it is the physical aspect of the comedy that outdoes the script here, and while that is no criticism of the stunt work or set pieces, a lack of somewhat more layered humour leaves the film feeling hollow; failing to live up to its full potential. The opening act is particularly burdensome. Apart from a couple of laughs during the attempted arrest of some bikers in a public park, the film proceeds to drag its feet, vainly looking for ways to intertwine jokes with storytelling until the pair are shipped off to Jump Street.<br/><br/>Other parts of the film still feel done to death, again a mark against the film's reluctance to go all-out in an effort to produce something truly original. It could have done without the love interest for the loser, made all the more disconcerting as it is a love between a high schooler and a grown man. Although Schmidt and Jenko start off as friends, their falling out/moment of clarity/reconciliation can be seen coming a mile away, occurring too late in the film and needlessly slowing down the second half. Yet, if you're expecting an utter disaster, like this particular viewer was, you might just leave surprised.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.

Jonah Hill was Oscar nominated for his role in Moneyball and he did a great job. Do people who saw and liked Moneyball think they will see the same kind of Jonah Hill's character in these comedies? His Moneyball character (shy, quiet, intelligent, low-key funny, unsuspecting) is his strength and not this raunch.

","When I first came to know that (yet) another old TV show is dusted off for a big-screen adaptation, I wasn't that excited at all. After all, that show happens to be the once-popular 21 Jump Street which starred then-young Johnny Depp who became a star here before he gradually earned his distinctive reputation in the Hollywood cinema. Back then, the story about an undercover police unit composed of young-looking officers specializing in youth crime is refreshingly new. But now, it's seriously a worn-out cliché. Then there's the casting of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum -- oh, wait -- Channing Tatum does a comedy? I smell an immediate recipe for disaster here, but directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord's (2009's CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS) live-action debut here seriously caught me by surprise . For all those naysayers out there, this big-screen version of 21 JUMP STREET is surprisingly funny and very entertaining as well.<br/><br/>Like the TV show, the movie revolves around Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), two young-looking cops who both transferred to the 21 Jump Street division where they will be going undercover posing as students to infiltrate the drugs-dealing business that has been going on at a local high school. Both of them go by their names of Doug and Brad, and once there, they must find way to investigate the rampant use of a dangerous hallucinogenic called H.F.S. Their first lead is a dealer and classmate Eric (Dave Franco), whom they are trying to get close with, in hope that one day he will lead them to the mysterious supplier.<br/><br/>Story-wise, Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill's screenplay is actually nothing new at all. But what makes it refreshingly different than most like-minded script out there is the way how the execution is played out in such a hilarious manner. While there are times the script is trying too hard to be funny, rest assured most of the scenes never fail to elicit some genuine laughs. Thanks to the hard R-rating, Bacall and Jonah Hill let the story rip with all those colorful profanities like nobody's business. Added to that, is some of the worthwhile self-parody gags throughout the movie, especially the highway car chase scene involving the theory of exploding vehicles.<br/><br/>Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller knows well how to keep the pace as entertaining as possible, while the cast here are no doubt the main star attraction here. Jonah Hill proves once again he's one of the genuine comic talents working today, but it was Channing Tatum who totally hits the ballpark with his surprisingly hilarious performance. Personally, I always thought Tatum's acting skill is always wooden at any given genre he's been involving so far (action, drama, romance) but he's finally proved himself as an excellent performer. In fact, both he and Jonah Hill are terrific together. And that's not all -- the rest of the supporting cast are equally playful and memorable as well, including Brie Larson as love interest Molly and Ice Cube at his profane best as Captain Dickson.<br/><br/>Apart from a flair of comedy, Phil Lord and Chris Miller does show some genuine talents in term of delivering well-crafted action sequence. Case in point is the aforementioned highway car chase scene and the violent shootout finale. Overall, 21 JUMP STREET is one of the best action comedy movies really need to be checked out for. And while you're at it, there's a surprise cameo appearance (priceless, indeed) throughout the movie."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","6","16 May 2013"," Let's jump into 21 Jump Street. Surprising it was pretty good.
","At first, I didn't want to watch this movie. Not that I'm loyal to the original or anything. I wasn't a huge fan of the 1987's show '21 Jump Street' nor did the trailers do any favors. The trailer look awful, and it seemed like an entirely pointless remake. I did however watch this movie when my friends told me that I should give it a try. I guess the movie had a lot of Street Cred. Surprising this movie was pretty good, and pretty damn funny. The movie starts out with not the original cast or even the same characters of the show, but two new characters in their high school days. While, it's only for a very brief time on film, just long enough to establish Schmidt (Jonah Hill) as an insecure nerd and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as a dumb jock. It then cuts to present day, where both are working as undercover cops on Jump Street. The new cops are tasked with finding the supplier of a new recreational drug called ""HFS"". For them, to find him, they must go undercover at the local high school, and forced to relive their old high school days. They soon find out that surprising, the high school life has change since their outing. The movie comedy is mostly hits for me, as I love how they make fun of high school comedy and buddy-cop clichés. There are a lot of unexpected and hilarious lines delivered totally straight forward. The movie does have quite a few moments of parody that were pretty funny. This is just one of those high school movie clichés that the movie had to hit. The high school over the top party. The twist here is that the party is being put on by a couple of totally irresponsible and stupid adults, who not only have access to alcohol but an entire evidence locker full of illegal drugs. I find this part of the movie, a bit of contradiction. Schmidt and Jenko try to arrest a bunch of bikers in the beginning of the movie, for smoking marijuana. Then later on the film, they steals marijuana to be used at the party. How is it, OK for them to smoke 'Mary Jane' and not the bikers? Also, the movie glorified their irresponsible for serving alcohol to minors is just wrong. Also how the movie makes it seem that if you want to have a good time, take drugs and drink alcohol. Don't add glamor to that kind of stuff for minors. That's why we have stupid shows like 16 & Pregnant. Don't ask how they even became cops in the first place, and how they never get punished for any of the mistakes they do throughout the film like forgetting the Miranda rights, stealing cars, and weapon discharge. Not one disciplinary action for anything they do. Also how is Jonah Hill's character Schmidt allow to hit on Molly (Brie Larson) when she could be underage? The movie never establish what her age is, but if she is 17, that's still a criminal act of having relationship with a minor. They make several gags in the movie about how Jenko and Schmidt look old, yet the actors portraying the high schoolers don't look like they belong there, too. The only ones, I did believe were in high school was the so called geeks. The acting is pretty good from all the cast. Yes, there are a few cameos of the Original cast of '21 Jump Street' playing themselves. While the TV show was taking as a serious crime drama, the movie makes it seem like a joke, even beloved characters are made out to be silly. If you are a fan of the 1987's show, you might find this movie making fun of you, and making you feel stupid for liking the original show. I don't get the film, is it trying to pay tribute to the show or parody it? The movie has false advertising written all over. For the regular fans of the show, do warning, this movie isn't like the show. Anyways their cameo is very short so if you're not paying attention, you might miss it. By the way, check all the shots on the TV in the film. Look at the scene where they are getting a car, and last the scene where the drug deal go wrong. You will find them there. The music choices for film are pretty good, but I can do without that damn Kesha's song in the end. Overall, the movie is pretty entertaining to me. So go see it."
"Legendary_Badass","2","23","55","9 March 2012"," A Mockery
","Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are inept rookie cops. The chief assigns them to an undercover squad comprised of young looking police officers who pose as high school students. Their first assignment is to infiltrate a burgeoning drug ring selling dealing what's called HFS.<br/><br/>The last time anyone saw Hill in a feature film he didn't look anything like this. It's obvious that 21 Jump Street was filming somewhere in-between his recent weigh loss. Scholars could looks back at this as the initial phase of Skinny Jonah Hill, and from all I can tell a dire career move. A healthy lifestyle is important, but when you're a young actor with a lofty gimmick it's advised you stick with it. <br/><br/>Our other lead, Tatum, is far outside his comfort zone of dancing and combat roles. As one of the few who saw last year's The Dilemma I assume you Channing Tatum had no ounce of comedic timing in that film. Instead of playing the foil to Hill, Tatum's Jenko is also represented as a comedic character. Shockingly dumb, he can't remember the Miranda warning. But not only are the leads played up as fools, every breathing character in the film's world has been dealt the same surreal card. <br/><br/>Punchlines and sight gags abound in what sounds like a serious plot. The YouTube demographic gets service through the colorful titles that appear during the phases of a HFS high. They're weak efforts but do offer sheer numbers to overpower less analytical audiences. In the past I have indeed found myself falling into the laughter along with the crowd, much like how the peer pressure gets to the students of this movie, but the closest I could come to mustering but a smile came by a quip from Ice Cube of all people.<br/><br/>Back on track with the story. High school has changed a lot since our heroes graduated in 2005—if you can look at them and buy that. What made Schmidt a nerd now makes him part of the cool crowd. Sports are all but shunned, leaving Jenko on the outside. This might be the surprise of 21 Jump Street that is to say if the film offers one. It took some guessing to identify the drug supplier, more a fault of the bizarre writing—there isn't an adult figure in the school who cares about the well-being of students.<br/><br/>Despite sharing a title and cameos from the most famous leads of the series, 21 Jump Street bares so little in common with the TV show that the only comparable films is the unrated home release of 2005's The Dukes of Hazzard. 21 Jump Street is one lowbrow, violent, swear-ridden, manic flick that's as mature as its director duo of Phil Lord & Chris Miller.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is without shame, even going to the extent of taunting the audience with its referential nod toward the remake/reboot movement. Even speaking as a non-fan of the TV series, I find the mockery overbearing. It's not simple enough to say they flipped a TV drama into a teen comedy, they flipped it into a particularly crude one.<br/><br/>Check out my video review at site VaughnOnMovies.com"
"darshancruz","3","11","23","23 March 2012"," 21 Jump street: Watch 21 and jump watching this movie !
","21 Jump Street released with a movie of a similar genre ""This is war"" and boy that's what you call comedy.<br/><br/>This is about 2 cops, one (Channing) a stud and one (Jonah) a dud. They both are given as assignment to go back to college as undercover cops and find the people involved in a drug racket.<br/><br/>Both of them try their level best to make you laugh, but sadly the script and dialogues are so pathetic that they fail to not even tickle a bone. One of the idea worth mentioning is the 4 phases you go through when you have a drug called HFS. Ice Cube thinks he is one cool guy using the m*f* word. The other actors who just fit in this plot aren't worth mentioning<br/><br/>Its very pathetic to believe that critics/reviewers have given this movie anything beyond 3/10.This one's where you blame it all on the script..Avoid and enjoy 'This is war'or 21 instead."
"kyrat","5","6","11","21 June 2012"," OK, but not for fans of the original, intended for the brainless/sophomoric comedy fans
","I really don't get the the Jonah Hill thing, I don't find him/his movies very funny nor am I into the raunchy teen sex films that seeem all the rage, so I avoided this in the theater. Then, one day, I was on a plane, and since I loved the original series, I decided to watch it......<br/><br/>If you think of it as a satire of the original show and remember that it's probably aimed at 14 yr old boys, yes it's kind of funny.<br/><br/>However, since what I really liked about the original show was that they took these matters (homophobia, bullying, teen prostitution, drugs) seriously -- turning it into a comedy was rather jarring.<br/><br/>Things I was disappointed in: the other 2 main characters, Holly Robinson & Dustin Nguyen's characters were not mentioned at all, I guess the two other sneering officers shown for about a minute were supposed to represent them? Ice Cube's role was turned into nothing but gratuitous swearing that added no value to any of his scenes. (were they trying to say that's all that Cpt Fuller did?)<br/><br/>Things I was creeped out at: Jonah Hill's character falling for an underage HS girl was super creepy. Gratuitous sex scene at party of supposedly underage kids being show - ultra creepy. The fact that these supposed officers of the law would raided the lockup to then provide alochol & drugs to kids. I know they're portrayed as stupid & that they were just trying to fit in, but it was so unrealistic & stupid it was jarring.<br/><br/>Parts I liked: When they discovered that values at school had changed and dumb jocks were no longer popular and that intelligence and environmentalism were valued. The cameo by ""Tom"" & ""Doug"" (even though it was during a very dumb scene) The inside jokes to keep an old-school fan amused (naming a character Jenko, Korean Jesus, etc.)"
"suiteruk","8","8","16","1 May 2012"," Hilarious
","If you like Superbad, The Sitter, Knocked up, anchorman or any other type of easy to follow comedy then this really is for you. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill (Superbad and Moneyball) and Channing Tatum (Step up) are a perfect match and compliment each other really well. Laughing scenes throughout the film make the 109 minute movie easily bearable. Some good cameo roles keeps the viewer on their feet and shows off just how versatile some actors are. <br/><br/>Good plot and easy to tell story, far funnier than I thought it would be and great acting duo between Hill and Tatum. I think the 15 rating is right as there are references to drugs and swearing but ultimately anyone between 16-25 is going to enjoy this film."
"cadillac20","7","11","24","1 March 2012"," A Lot More Entertaining Than I Expected, Very Laugh Out Loud Funny
","I don't know if you'd say I was lucky enough, but I did get the chance to see this tonight in a special screening. It's the kind of movie I looked at while watching the trailers and asked 'Why?'. And seeing it at the screening for free is probably the only way I would go. But, to my surprise, the movie is pretty damn funny. Certainly it's a bit inexplicable in many areas. But if you forget a lot of the logic leaps, the situations are funny. The attempt to be different and poke fun at clichés is pretty obvious, but none the less there are many funny moments.<br/><br/>As I said, there are issues with the logic of the film. Right off the bat we meet our two main characters, polar opposites in high school, Channing Tatum's character being the popular jock who makes fun of Jonah Hill's character, the dork. They're fairly clichéd as far as HS stereotypes go, but this actually feeds into the film later when we see those clichés destroyed by today's often indescribable cliques. Somehow, both of these guys end up as cops, something that initially seemed puzzling to me, since neither of them seem like they would want to be cops. But really, it's just an excuse to get on with the jokes, so it's easily overlooked. Soon, our fumbling duo is sent into high school as undercover cops to take down a new drug being passed around. Really, this story is nothing more than an excuse to make jokes about clichéd situations, but surprisingly the jokes are pretty funny. Clichés are definitely broken. The cool kids at school aren't jocks, but socially conscious teens who care about the environment. In fact, the entire social spectrum is flipped upside down.<br/><br/>There are some fairly funny moments. Highlights include the visions induced by a high Jonah Hill and a highway chase in which nothing goes as expected. Sadly, the film isn't particularly memorable. It's funny enough, and the humor is well written, but the actors are what you'd expect them to be. Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill here, and Channing Tatum, while surprisingly funny, is still Channing Tatum. My favorite is actually Ice Cube, who appears as the Lt. in charge of the Jump Street operation. He's funny as the angry chief, and they do in fact call this out, though it seems a bit forced. None the less, it's been a while since Ice Cube made an appearance, and he's pretty funny here. The rest of the cast is decent, though none really as memorable as Cube, or even Hill and Tatum for that matter.<br/><br/>The writing is mostly to blame here. The story is weak, weak enough to bring a lot of the rest of the film down. The film requires a huge suspension of disbelief and you can't help but wonder if everyone in the film is an idiot for overlooking so many numerous coincidences. They sure do talk about how Tatum looks too old for high school, and yet not one person thinks that maybe he IS too old for high school? Other leaps in logic make you wonder how stupid the film can get, but again, it really isn't about the story, it's about the jokes. In fact, that's really the only reason that this is getting a 7. Even if I don't want to admit it, I did laugh quite a bit at this film. Tatum and Hill have great chemistry and the humor bounces between them very well. I AM fairly tired of Hill's comedy schtick, but combined with the poking fun of clichés and even at the film itself, it's a pretty consistently funny movie. Heck, there's even a cameo that almost makes it worthwhile, though I am sure you can probably guess what that is.<br/><br/>With so many films coming out that really are nothing to write home about, 21 Jump Street isn't a bad way to kill time at the theater. It's certainly funnier than I expected. Not a great film, but a funny one and maybe worth your time."
"anne_2356","10","12","27","9 March 2012"," Great Movie
","I have never seen or heard of the original 21 Jump Street so I cannot comment on whether this sticks to that series. However, I think this movie is great and I recommend it for teenagers and adults. The humor overall is pretty good and had everybody in the theater laughing. Sometimes the story came off as highly unrealistic, but the entertainment value more than made up for it.<br/><br/>Both of the main actors were good in this and they played off of each other perfectly.<br/><br/>I'll probably go to this movie again when it comes to the cheap theaters or the drive-in. It was that much fun to watch."

","I, at first, thought it was a reboot of the old series which made me feel they were either going to ruin it or I wouldn't like it, but it wasn't. OK, so here's the run down. Jenko and Schmidt are being transferred to a reopened division of an 80's undercover operation. When I heard the word reopened, I was happy. Their job was to take down a drug operation inside of a high school. With loads of comedy, action, and a few explosions, it made for a great movie. Tatum and Hill did an excellent job in their parts and Ice Cube, well, he was perfect for his part. There was also a surprise cameo in the movie too and people went crazy for him as the theater erupted in applause. The only problem I had with the movie was there were a lot of raunchy jokes. I don't mind raunchy jokes, remarks, or scenes, but too many can be a bad thing, but again, I could not stop laughing. I would definitely watch this again and when it comes out on DVD and blu-ray, I will own me a copy."
"ssvikas","5","9","19","30 April 2012"," Just another comedy; has nothing new!
","Movies like '21 Jump Street' are like the run of the mill comedies we have in Bollywood. They completely lack novelty but are worth your money for the laughs. The film is based on the TV series of the same name that launched Johnny Depp and has now turned funny-man Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum into producers. <br/><br/>Shmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are from the same school but hardly ever got along. While Shmidt is plump and a nerd, the latter is a Jock. Both end up joining the police academy and emerge as buddies, helping out with each others weaknesses. <br/><br/>Since the duo has youthful looks, they are sent undercover as students to a local school to bust a drug ring. And then follows the usual humor as they get into school plays, some romance and run-ins with the drug lords while they also deal with an expletive spewing boss, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). <br/><br/>In a way, it reminded me of the Bollywood movie 'Main Hoon Na' which had Shah Rukh Khan getting into college as an undercover guard to one of the students there. Just like in '21 Jump Street', the former too had humor and romance. There is also another Hollywood movie with a similar story; can't recollect the name though! <br/><br/>Jonah Hill is best remembered for his role in 'Superbad' a comedy on a high-school party theme and his latest act in a supporting role in the Oscar nominated 'Moneyball'. But, his best achievement is shedding pounds by the dozens to suit his character. Tatum, also a regular face in collegiate humor flicks is fine, but nothing exceptional. <br/><br/>'21 Jump Street' has already garnered good international ratings. Remember, the US release was more than a month ago. But, don't be dissuaded by those ratings or rave reviews; let me assure you that this movie has nothing new. At best, it qualifies as a pastime flick on TV; but not worth a trip to the silver screen."

For the most part, I found it all quite hilarious during the first hour before seeming to lose some steam during the last 20 or so minutes. Still, Johah Hill and Channing Tatum never lose their energy during that whole time. And there's some occasional good turns by Rob Riggle, Nick Offerman, Chris Parnell, Ellie Kemper, and Brie Larson to also provide some enjoyment. So on that note, this satiric movie version of the TV series 21 Jump Street is worth a look. Oh, and you can expect some choice cameos when watching something like this."

The continued sorry attempts at a fish out of water, or even a sad try at a buddy flick fall far short of believable (I do realize that this is supposed to be a comedy but I know too many stupid people in real life to waste time on this), and I cannot find it in me to even care about the sad plight of the high school nerd and the jock going back to school to redeem themselves.<br/><br/>Foo"

","Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! I sound a bit Kris Krossed there or Van Halenish, take your pick. I just wanted to jump in quickly to my review of the hilarious comedy ""21 Jump Street"". The film is based on the popular 80's TV show. Like the show, the film focuses on a couple of young police officers who go undercover in a high school to investigate crimes, more of the drug dealing affair. Channing Tatum stars as young Officer Jenko, who is the muscular good-looking type but not too bright in the cerebral bulb. Jenko (the J is not silent) was a bully during high school. Jonah Hill co-stars as young Officer Schmidt, who is the vertically challenged officer who is gifted with mental aptitude but lacking in the physical component. Schmidt was one of Jenko's main bully targets in high school. So jump few years later, and what we see is that Jenko & Schmidt reunite now as young officers and even partner up together; but this time around in a more friendly tone, even though they do have their disagreements. Schmidt and Jenko's undercover high school mission is to find the supplier of a dangerous synthetic drug that is being circulated and sold in the school to many students. But due to their inadequacies, Schmidt and Jenko do get in a bit of uproarious situations in trying to complete their mission, which in hence becomes nearly a ""Mission Impossible""; had to plug in another movie that was adapted from a popular TV show. Speaking of missions, Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have successfully completed the mission that many filmmakers have not been able to succeed in, which is adapting an infamous TV show into a great film. Michael Bacall's screenplay was side-splitting and engaging. Channing Tatum demonstrated that he could bare his stuff also for the comedic genre with his humorous performance as Jenko. And it is ""No Schmidt"" that Jonah Hill is quite the talent, with yet another strong performance here as Schmidt. Other ""21 Jump Street"" notable acting performances that were on target included Ice Cube as the fiery Police Captain Dickson, Rob Riggle as the oddball P.E. Coach Mr. Walters , and some guy that had the ""21 Jump Street"" gig before who should remain nameless so I do not commit the horrific cinematic crime of movie spoiling. ""21 Jump Street"" is a very funny movie that you should investigate as soon as possible. ***** Excellent"

Even thats a waste of time and space. Just another generic comedy. If I was 14 maybe I would like it but this is crap. Jonah Hill was great in Superbad.

","This is definitely not the 21 Jump Street that I remember from the 80s. The program that launched Johnny Depp as a star had its funny moments, usually supplied by Peter DeLuise, but the episodes tackled some very serious topics and many of them were outstanding drama without a laugh in them.<br/><br/>Such is not the case here where you've got a couple of misfit cops who might have graduated from the Police Academy that George Gaynes was the commandant of. The old Jump Street program that was in an abandoned chapel is being revived for the new millenia and Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have been selected for the program because of their youthful demeanor.<br/><br/>Their rather impatient captain, Ice Cube sends them into a high school to bust a drug ring after the death of one of the students. These two manage to mismatch their covers, but incredibly enough it seems to work out for them.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill have some history between them. Tatum was a popular jock and an academic dud who barely graduated. Hill was a nerdy kid who couldn't get anyone of the opposite sex to look at him. For him this is a big do over, but he barely keeps his mind on the assignment.<br/><br/>By the advertising I knew I was not going to get the old familiar 21 Jump Street other than cameo appearances by some of the series regulars back in the day. But I've seen it all before and done better even in the Police Academy movies which never pretended to be comedy of the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>The film has some comic moments, but will disappoint people who think they're going to see a big screen version of what was a big hit in the late 80s."

If dumb, stupid, mindless comedy so predictable a grade school child could of written better sounds like fun to you, then by all means watch this movie.

"AZINDN","2","8","18","4 November 2012"," Offensive Pandering and Prejudice to Idiot Audiences
","Probably the worst movie targeted to lowly teen fart and homophobic humor, 21 Jump Street has no element that is not offensive. Loosely based on the 80s television drama series that launched Johnny Depp on the world, it is not related to that production beyond a title. The premise of adult cops serving undercover in high schools to discover drugs and crime features the bumbling partners as brothers played by Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, who are less than competent officers facing expulsion from the force. Sent to Jump Street as a last resort before unemployment, their supervisor is a foul language director played by Ice Cube, whose acting ability is as limited as his profanity laced vocabulary. <br/><br/>The film relies on racial and sexual prejudices that would because of the youthful cast seem innocuous, but are not. Other offensive actions include violence against a gay, black student who is decked by thick-headed Tatum, the first day at school, and later an unfunny and sexually inappropriate female teacher who is ready to jump his studly bones. Nebbish Hill in a slimmed down version, is the geekier and now popular brother, tenuous around the same kind of juvenile populations that he hated as a teen and finding himself living with his overly gushing parents whose kitschy southwestern theme home is a shrine to their beloved idealized son. Even a school production of Peter Pan include the reference to the ""squaws"" with Tiger Lily. Once in school, the men seek to make connections to the drug suppliers who are the clean cut, UC Berkeley bound rich kid (Dave Franco, James' less than talented younger brother), and the overtly pumped football coach. Why these characters would be thought humorous reveals the worst attitudes of prejudice, racism, and sexual predation that for some writers passes as appropriate for youth-oriented audiences.<br/><br/>Only when the undercover agents are faced with the biker gang of drug dealers and the distributor turns out to be the foot ball coach does the action become interesting with the revelation of undercover DEA agents Johnny Depp and Peter Delouise, (the original Jump Street crew in a brief cameo) but even their appearance can't elevate this film from the worst offensive violence in a Robert Rodriguez shoot 'em up scene. Until the end credits, 21 Jump Street manages to offend every notion of high school experience and once the bad guys are captured, the two officers are further thrust upward to college in hopes that a sequel will be in the works. In all fairness, that would add insult to a gross injury."
"FFman-847-460126","6","5","10","19 March 2012"," Fantastic Script Helps Remake Work
","What is the best way to rejuvenate a rehashed television series from the 1980s? Bring in some writers that have the craft and skill to make fun of their project. This movie is sprinkled with Easter Eggs for the keen observer. From the original show in the background of a gunfight to the Captain complaining about how people don't notice when you give them pretty much the same thing but call it something different.<br/><br/>By being able to make fun of itself, this movie gets off on the right foot. With Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill in the lead, this movie is very entertaining. The development of the storyline shows that the writer has skill—and that the actors do well with what they've been given. Channing Tatum has always felt a little lacking in the acting skills. Although that is still slightly a problem, it is covered up with a good script. Jonah Hill—ever since Moneyball—will never have to prove his value as an actor again.<br/><br/>The shortfalls of this movie are all grouped together in the final half hour. Although I respect Michael Becall as screenwriter, it appears his has neither the skills nor the wherewithal to say no to producers or the studio. Everything good that filled this movie was erased by the typical Hollywood ending. For the love of god—they even alluded to a sequel. Why does the Hollywood ideal of a ""happy ending"" have to destroy so many movies?<br/><br/>I have to mention the epic cameo by Johnny Depp. Although it is unlikely to beat out the Bill Murray Cameo from Zombieland, it is one of the best that I have seen. Placing Johnny Depp back into a role he hasn't played in two decades is the perfect way to please the fans while adding a strange new element to the movie. 21 Jump Street may be worth the money just for this cameo.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is absolutely worth the money. You will genuinely enjoy the opening hour and half of this movie. Although it is thoroughly destroyed in the final half hour, it is not enough to take away from the skilled writing and acting that takes place. Your best bet is to go see this movie, then send a letter to Michael Becall to tell him to stand up for his scripts.<br/><br/>reillyreviews.wordpress.com"
"jbacks3","2","6","13","29 July 2012"," A good movie...?
","21 Jump Street (the series) is notable for just about 1 thing: Johnny Depp, who's matured into an interesting actor. How 21 Jump Street (the movie) rates these glowing reviews is beyond my comprehension. It's dumb... the central characters are not believable as cops or high school students. The plot--- what there is--- involves infiltrating a designer drug operation. The best that can be said about this mess is that it's ---slightly--- more coherent than most other idiotic TV show retreads (Starsky & Hutch being the crap standard against which I measure them all). Hollywood: Please stop making TV show adaptations!!! They all blow! But if anyone's interested I have a boffo idea for a HAZEL update..."
"geoffwoo99","3","3","5","4 January 2018"," ok.... if you're 15.
","This is pretty trashy. There are one or two characters which are well done - the angry black Police Captain caricature was very good - but overall humour is low level and immature. It needs some depth imho. Superficial slapstick and farce only gets a film so far. Airplane, Big Bang or the Simpsons it isnt.<br/><br/>Teenagers might find it OK, but anyone else, save your money. Go and watch some paint drying somewhere. You've seen this stuff done elsewhere, and better."
"EthanBJones_03","7","3","5","17 August 2016"," Definitely worth a watch but not as good as time passes
","Overall: This movie is fantastic and hilarious... on the first and second watch. I know this won't affect some people but for me it loses it's charm after the second or third viewing. Personally, I've watched this movie four times and own it on DVD. Hilarious on 1st and 2nd viewings but then drags on third and fourth one were I've wrote this review. Definitely watch it but can't say it's worth a DVD purchase.<br/><br/>Good: The movie is very funny on it's first few swings and can still get some laughs out of me now. The performances are stellar from Tatum to Hill and even up to Franco and Ice Cube. They all live their character and you can see they love what they were doing. Great cameos from the original show and the cinematography is great for the most part.<br/><br/>Bad: The plot overall, for me, is quite messy and tries helplessly to link characters and previous events together as in one giant loop. Some of the supporting cast were boring namely Molly, Dave's 'gang', the biker troupe and a few others. Music was mediocre at best at didn't fit at quite a few points. As stated above it loses its charm over time and just feels boring. Some editing and cuts feel a tad sloppy and fast but this is generally played for comedic effect and I doubt it would bother many people. If you want great action, don't watch this movie. The action scenes aren't cool, jaw dropping or otherwise interesting and if anything feels like the setup for the inevitable punch line. You can tell it was leaning far on the comedic side rather than action which is okay but I would have liked to see more effort.<br/><br/>Best Part: The final confrontation between Jonah and the main villain were he overcomes his fears and delivers a bad ass one-liner.<br/><br/>7/10 Best Part:"
"Mr-Fusion","7","3","5","28 June 2014"," It's predictable, but the laughs sneak up on you
","Nick Offerman had one of the great lines in 21 JUMP STREET:<br/><br/>""You see, the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle sh-t from the past and expect us all not to notice.""<br/><br/>Which is funny, but even still: how do these properties get picked for remake/reboot/refranchising? Someone, somewhere thought it was a good idea to take the Johnny Depp show from the '80s and revamp it, but how'd they arrive at this particular property? Do the suits write a bunch of names on the wall and wherever the dart lands, that's what's getting remade? <br/><br/>In any event, 21 JUMP STREET works mostly because of its script and the chemistry between the two leads. Some of the jokes work well, others fall flat. Subverting the high school archetypes was also a clever bit. And I didn't expect to like Jonah Hill as much as I did, but that kinda goes for the whole thing. Channing Tatum made for surprisingly funny physical comedy. And it's really those two that make this work as well as it does - although, it was kinda funny seeing one person from every sitcom under the sun showing up here. <br/><br/>It's pretty good stuff, and as for reheating the past goes, it's a winner. <br/><br/>Also, really liked that Johnny Depp showed up at the end. <br/><br/>7/10"
"cleary-joshua","7","3","5","3 June 2014"," An enjoyable and self-aware comedy that only occasionally crosses the line...
","Only a few days ago I wrote in this blog that I've said the words ""Channing Tatum? I'm not watching that..."" far too many times. As an actor he's limited himself to mindless action films (note ""G.I. Joe"") or vomit-inducing chick flicks (don't see ""The Vow""), which are the types of movies which I usually try to distance myself from. When I sat down with the family to watch ""21 Jump Street"", my hopes weren't that high, but I must confess now that I found him bearable and actually quite funny here. This is an enjoyable and self-aware comedy, with some good performances, that only occasionally crosses the line in terms of crudity.<br/><br/>In the film, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play cop partners, who went to high-school together and did not get on. Hill was the nerdy kid while Tatum was the handsome jock who bullied him. They meet many years later when both sign up for the police force, and decide that their partnership would allow each to motivate the other. Due to some difficult and hilarious circumstances, the two are punished by being moved to the ""21 Jump Street"" division and sent undercover into a high-school to investigate a drug problem there. Much of the comedy comes from the two integrating themselves back into school life, accidentally taking each others' fake personalities, and being generally awkward.<br/><br/>The cast of the film is very strong, with Jonah Hill's comedic performance being one of the best I've seen him in yet. In the supporting cast, Brie Larson plays a great love interest for Hill's character, and Ice Cube brings some fantastic self-referential humour into the film, about how ridiculous the concept of the '21 Jump Street' operation actually is. The fact that the film knows how implausible most of it is makes it all the more funny throughout. Dave Franco makes for a fairly believable bad guy, but the standout performance in the film goes to Nick Offerman, despite his small screen time, for his deadpan Police Chief, which is utterly hilarious.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who also helmed the first 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' film and 'The LEGO Movie'. As shows in all of these films, their talent as comedic directors is extremely good, and they create a believable world for the characters. The film's greatest problem is that sometimes the jokes don't work, and some go too far. The crude nature of a lot of the film turned me off it slightly, particularly the final gross-out gag at the climax of the film. It doesn't feel particularly necessary, and is just a bit disgusting. It is this brand of comedy that is prominent in the not-so-funny ""Hangover"" movies, but thankfully not all of the jokes in this film are based on it. All in all, ""21 Jump Street"" is a funny and interesting comedy, and despite a few flaws, is incredibly watchable."

"grundseth13","6","3","5","12 April 2012"," Not as good as I was expecting
","I went to this movie because many friends and family members claimed it was the funniest movie they have seen in a while. I beg to differ. Although this movie contained some funny clips, I thought some of the humor was far too bland. This movie is rated R, but is mostly 15-17 year-old humor. The movie seemed to turn into more of a confusing action movie as time went on. I was almost confused and frustrated instead of entertained. With about a half hour left of the movie, I found myself wondering when it was going to end. The theater was not filled with laughter like I was expecting. The movie was barely worth going to and I will not be purchasing it when it comes out on Blu-Ray/DVD."
"afh179","6","3","5","7 April 2012"," Silly comedy, not as funny as you think
","I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in this movie right here. I went to the theater with hopes high ready to laugh myself silly, figuring that I was sure to judging by the look of the trailers I had seen. However, instead of a gut-busting comedy, what I got was a silly little movie that got old relatively quickly, and wore out it's welcome sooner than I thought it would.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, 21 Jump Street delivers a few hilarious sequences. The Peter Pan play sequence, for instance, had me laughing harder than I've laughed during a movie since last years 50/50. And the party that the two bumbling cops throw is a pretty funny, entertaining part. But really, aside from a few one-liners and quips here and there, this movie offers up nothing original and is overloaded with clichés. For example, a loud, angry black cop. A scary, villainous motorcycle gang. An overbearing and slightly gay-tinged gym teacher. Yep, just about every comedy cliché can be found in this one.<br/><br/>What this movie does have going for it is Jonah Hill. The funny man never seems to disappoint, and in this one plays the dweebie Morton Schmidt to perfection. Channing Tatum isn't bad as his counterpart, and the two show decent chemistry on screen. Also, watch out for a movie-stealing cameo towards the end from someone we all know and love (myself especially).<br/><br/>All in all, this film does not live up to the hype. It is a funny ride through a decent storyline, but not much more. Don't go in expecting your gut to bust, as you will be very disappointed. Go in with an open mind and you will be entertained, as this is an entertaining film with some genuinely hilarious moments."
"sheba_4555","2","4","8","22 February 2014"," Review of 21 Jump Street
","This is suppose to be comedy, yet I found it far from being a comedy. It is vulgar. Could Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum ever be funny without obscenity or vulgarity, I doubt it.<br/><br/>The dialog is childish and with no intelligence. There is not one piece of intelligent dialog, only swearing and vulgarity. <br/><br/>I didn't find the movie funny, I found it to be vulgar which is very disturbing.<br/><br/>The movie is not good and shows how low lives of society have become actors and have no acting skills or any piece of intelligence. <br/><br/>The movie could have been good without the obscenity and vulgarity that the movie has dished out."
"mdixon","3","4","8","15 July 2012"," at least the 7.4 rating is funny
","this is an objectively abysmal movie, there's just no way around that. it isn't even mildly funny unless you're maybe 6 or 7 years old. although jonah hill certainly has his awkward teen schtick down, the movie is just a bad rehash of what's been done a billion times before but with new people. no one expects these dime-a-dozen summer teen flicks to break new ground all the time but jeez, at least try to make something marginally entertaining since not all moviegoers are 10-year-olds.<br/><br/>I should've stayed away based on the red flags so it's not like I wasn't warned. usually though when your expectations are so low it's hard to be let down but they did it with this one. I never saw the TV show and don't even know if that was a comedy so it's not like I'm comparing this to memories of that. I thought jonah hill was fairly awesome in superbad (a close 2nd after mclovin) and liked him in the russell brand English rocker movie. but I saw the high IMDb rating on this one (7.4 or something like that) and figured I was missing a new napoleon dynamite or something.<br/><br/>wrong. in the real world this movie is a 3 or 4 at best. maybe sit through the whole thing on a dare but for anyone else you'll do more yawning and checking your watch than laughing or even cracking a smile for that matter."

","At some point Hollywood is going to run out of 80's movies or TV shows to remake. I often wonder what will happen when they have all gone twice around the track? Third time's the charm? Let's hope not, this has to end at some point, doesn't it?<br/><br/>It was with this feeling that I cautiously approached the latest 80s remake. This time it was the turn of 21 Jump Street, apparently a popular US TV show from 1987, which famously gave Johnny Depp his big break, but strangely I don't recall ever seeing it growing up. This time around we see Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), playing an ex-high school nerd and jock, who are forced into an unlikely pairing after enrolling in Police Academy and using their combination of brawn and brains to get through basic training. After an enthusiastic and somewhat optimistic drugs bust goes amusingly array the two are shipped out to 21 Jump Street, an undercover unit run by Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), set up to infiltrate high school drug networks.<br/><br/>It is here that the film and indeed the Hill and Tatum double act finds its feet. High school has clearly changed since these two last attended. Schmidt and Jenko are still at opposite ends of the high school cool spectrum but this time there is some role reversal. Grades and the environment are the new barometers of cool, so Schmidt gets to experience the kind of high school experience he always dreamt of, whilst Jenko's quickly turns into nightmare. Can Schmidt and Jenko manage to bridge the social divide in the name of law enforcement?<br/><br/>I genuinely liked 21 Jump Street. Apparently it only bears a passing resemblance to the 80s show, which maybe is why it stands up so well on its own? Hill and Tatum worked well together and both seemed completely at ease as a double act. They deliver the requisite six laughs for a comedy before the first half hour is done. The following hour is well paced, entertaining and really quite watchable. Who knew Tatumn could crack a joke as well as bust a move? Probably not even him. The supporting cast are universally good, with a standout performance from an angry Ice Cube. Its good to have him back in an angry role for a change. There is also a notable cameo or two worth keeping your eyes peeled for.<br/><br/>Hill and Tatum are both at similar stages in their career. They are making commercially and occasionally critically successful films, but you get the feeling they are both still some distance from being able to carry a film on their own. The decision to team them up and share the load was a sensible one. Whilst it is no Starsky and Hutch, 21 Jump Street is head and shoulders above some of the turgid 80s remakes we have been subjected to recently and significantly better than some of the tired frat boy films which have been churned out of late."

","Not enough laughs in this for me...<br/><br/>there's a couple of funny moments here, but over an hour and a half of a film it's just not enough.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill has lost too much wight to play a 'fat' character anymore. just doesn't work. He's either got to find a new character to play in films or put the bulk back on.<br/><br/>On a side note, i've just seen that the producer of this film, Neal Moritz, having just ruined the classic 'Prom Night', is also about to release a triple massacre of film in the next couple of years, by ruining total recall, battle royale, and starship troopers respectively...<br/><br/>Why Hollywood?... why?"

","Sure, this is based on the 1987-91 television series of the same name by Stephen J. Cannell and Patrick Hasburgh, but I was amazed by how much I loved this movie. It takes that concept, goes crazy and pushes every teen movie cliche as far as it can take it.<br/><br/>In 2005, Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are denied access to their prom, with Schmidt rejected and Jenko's grades keeping him away. Years later, they meet again at police academy and somehow become best friends and eventually bike patrol partners. Their first arrest, a drug bust, goes bad when Greg forgets the Miranda rights.<br/><br/>The team is reassigned to the Jump Street team, which infiltrates high schools with undercover agents under the command of Captain Dickson (Ice Cube).<br/><br/>There's a drug at Sagan High School called HFS that has been killing students, so Morton and Greg get new identities and learn that society has changed. Everything that made Greg popular is now frowned upon, so his only friends are the geeks. Morton is now popular and fast friends with Eric (Dave Franco), who is creating the drugs.<br/><br/>Can the guys catch the criminals? Will Morton fall in love with Eric's girlfriend Molly (Brie Larson)? Will they throw a massive drug fueled party? Of course. But getting there is so much fun, as this is a movie that doesn't take itself or its subject matter seriously.<br/><br/>There are some great supporting actors here, from Rob Riggle as a gym teacher to Chris Parnell as a drama teacher, Ellie Kemper as a science teacher, Dakota Johnson as a fellow Jump Street team member and Nick Offerman as the Deputy Chief. If you loved the original show, good news. All of the original cast, except Richard Grieco and Dustin Nguyen, appear in cameo roles."

","As you would be aware by now 21 Jump Street is a remake of the television show from the 80s with the same name. This is a nice remake and it could be said that the film serves more of a nostalgic homage to the 80s than it does trying to be a standalone feature film. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are good as the mismatched duo and some side characters are quite funny. The film is more of a list of running gags and action pieces. Watch out for the cameo by Depp."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","3","30 September 2016"," 21 Fun Street
","""21 Jump Street"" is an American 105-minute film from 2012, so it will have its 5th anniversary next year. The directors are Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, not yet Emmy nominees at that time and the writer is Michael Bacall. He collaborated on the screenplay with Oscar nominee Jonah Hill and Hill is of course also a lead actor here. His co-lead is Channing Tatum and if you hear ""21 Jump Street"", then maybe you will think of the Johnny Depp television show right away. Depp is also one of the stars of the original series, who have a brief cameo in here. But back to the protagonists: We have Schmidt and Jenko who went to school together and one of them was the kid nobody liked and the other the kid everybody liked. And even if they weren't friends at all, they ended up as colleagues in the same profession. They work as police officers and the time they have spent together turned them into friends over the years. But sadly, they are as incompetent as it gets. This incompetence (and their infantile behavior) resulted in them being transferred to another department where they are instructed to go undercover after a student died from a new drug. They pose as students for pretty much the entire film afterward and not only their friendship is tested, but also their (in)competence.<br/><br/>I think this was a pretty decent watch. Most of the comedy worked well just like the character relationships and also the moments of drama, which weren't that serious admittedly. It's all about the comedy and the protagonists' relationship. Dave Franco (James' brother) and Oscar winner Brie Larson play major parts as well as students going to (high) school with our two heroes. Nick Offerman (P&R) and Jake Johnson (New Girl) give one-scene performances while Ice Cube shows up more frequently as the guy (pissed at) being in charge of the two chaotic guys. But in the end all turns out well. This is not a film you would watch if you were in for some realistic and convincing story or some great depth, but if you are just in the mood for a fairly pointless, but fun little movie. Hill and Tatum do what they have to do and I can see how the film received good reactions by most audiences. It was successful enough for a(n equally appreciated) sequel that came out two years later and maybe there will even be a third movie at some point. I personally would not say that I liked this movie enough to immediately want to see the second, but I still give it a thumbs-up and recommend the watch. Finally, I want to tell you guys about one of my favorite scenes that showed how the film is pretty classy. In a more serious moment, Hill's character says Tatum's that things shall not again be the way they were back then and everybody would expect things to actually become that way indeed, but the filmmakers took the creative path of making Hill's character the way Tatum's was back then and the other way around. It is truly a well-crafted film and you should see it. Very entertaining and this means something coming from somebody like myself who definitely isn't the greatest Jonah Hill fan."

"willcundallreview","7","2","3","10 July 2014"," Good old high school comedy,with Cops!
","21 Jump Street is a comedy with a lot of crude jokes, physical humour and a cast that can seem awkward as hell at times, yet still it is a hilarious film indeed. With a surprising performance from one the cast members and a story that doesn't have to be all about the comedy, 21 Jump Street succeeds in bringing humour we usually see only aimed at younger people, to everyone. I did feel that the film was solidly good and here below I will tell you why I thought that.<br/><br/>The story is actually well paced, doesn't rush along but never tries to compact all it's jokes in at once, this means jokes are evenly spread and right up until the end you still laugh. It is yes, full of so called ""rudeness"", this one is a miss for the whole family, but a watch nevertheless for the older people in the house as it may touch your comedy nerve and have you in fits of laughter. One more thing that this film gains is the way it has action scenes and car chases but doesn't always need humour to make them fun, the emotional side of the movie is terrible but the action/comedy and crime is excellent. <br/><br/>Channing Tatum surprised me here, he is the one who succeeds in doing well both in serious parts and comedy parts, I felt Jonah Hill although consistently funny, failed in a dramatic sense and parts become awkward when he enters. The rest of the cast work around them well, Ice Cube would have more appreciated if he had been in much more scenes. I liked Dave Franco, he is chilled all the way through and then the coach played by Rob Riggle is hilarious, brings much more different humour types in.<br/><br/>I liked the script and the group of people who wrote it do well to not only have physical humour or one liners, but also avoid recycling old jokes we have seen so often from high school comedies. At times the direction is poor, the script as said is great but when the characters come out to do it, sometimes direction is poor, makes scenes awkward and the joke ends after 3 seconds. One thing are the stunts, good gun battles and also car chases, make parts thrilling whilst you also laughing, all good stuff.<br/><br/>I guess one criticism is the crudeness, yes there parts maybe over doing the talk about the genital area, or about certain acts. The film is never dragged down because of crudeness but better jokes could have been placed in. As said the direction, it just makes scenes awkward, not funny and ruins the potential jokes the script has laid out for them and also Tatum and Hill have so much precision with the jokes, it is a waste at times.<br/><br/>I could easily say ""if your between 15 and 35, go and see this"" ,but I won't. I do believe than a vast mixed bag of people can and will like this and seeing as it is a remake of the original, fans of the old one may want to have a little look at this newer version. Some will have a big dislike for this movie and many will feel we have had this before, seen it before and the actors are just doing roles(especially Hill) that they have done before. I will say though that high schooler's may take a more special liking to it, seeing as it is about high school and all the modern things high schooler's do. <br/><br/>Overall yes it is Solidly a Good movie, not quite Very Good but way more than just a pretty good try at comedy. Have fun with it, don't take it to seriously and really, pretend your still in high school, you'll have more fun. Watch out for an interesting plot too, it is surprisingly well thought out for a straight out comedy and they don't mind loosening the jokes to let a bit of the seriousness out, but only for a few seconds because someone will host a house party."

","A buddy cop comedy disguised as a remake of a classic television series. This is one of the reboots/remakes that doesn't try to recreate the original. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are not playing classic characters in a more modern setting. However, this film does act as if it's a continuation of the series as not only does it refer to ""Jump Street"" as a long-running police operation, but there is a hilarious UNCREDITED cameo at the end with series originals who refer to being ex-Jump Street officers. The fact that the original series was dramatic and this is far from it doesn't seem to matter. Nothing really new or creative in story, all the usual buddy film happenings and teen movie shenanigans are here as well as the ""odd couple""-esque partnership. Some of the best parts are where they poke fun at themselves, like Nick Offerman's character using the Jump Street program as a metaphor for Hollywood: ""You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas. So all they do now is recycle s*** from the past and expect us all not to notice."" Worth a look for a laugh or two. 6.5/10"

","I used to watch the TV show 21 Jump Street, and while it was clever, I didn't think it was anything special. When I heard they were making a movie, it peeked my interest, but the previews made it look like it would be God awful, in one of the worst marketing campaigns for a film I've ever seen. After hearing some good things from friends and being that it had a good cast, I decided to give the film a shot and it far exceeded my expectations. Two of the dumbest and most immature cops on the force are sent on an undercover mission to infiltrate a local High School and find out where a new designer drug is coming from. Right from the start you could tell the film would lean more to the comedic side as opposed to the show, which was more dramatic. Going the comedic way, especially with the cast they had, was the right way to go, but much of the film was still unbelievable. Anyone who believes that either Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum could even come close to passing for High School student are completely out of their minds. Also, the speed in which these two idiots went from being the worst cops on the force to celebrated heroes was ridiculous. It would have been far more enjoyable if these guys just sorta stumbled into solving the crime, rather than all of a sudden becoming great cops. As for the cast, Jonah Hill continues to be the most underrated comedic actor in Hollywood. I have yet to see this guy do a bad movie. Channing Tatum was pretty good too, he's known more for his looks than his talent, but he fit his role extremely well. It was probably written specifically for his persona, similar to his role in Magic Mike, but he still is very good. Finally, the cast is rounded out by Dave Franco, the younger and better looking brother of James Franco, who for the very first time shows that he is more than just a kid, getting work because of his brother. He was very solid and perhaps the most believable and likable character in this film. 21 Jump Street is nothing new, it's another cop movie that blends comedy and action, like almost every other Lethal Weapon wannabe. The story isn't better than the rest, but it is funnier than most of the other films and it has some terrific cameos."
"TheSquiss","5","2","3","24 August 2012"," Cops, action, humour & a hint of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. What's not to like?
","I never watched the 80s TV series starring Johnny Depp. I was too busy being severely narked about it. In '85 I had the idea for a great TV show about a kid at school who was really a cop. My friends laughed and said it was stupid, unrealistic and, besides, who'd listen to an idea from a skinny little kid in the backwaters of somewhere distinctly not Hollywood? Then, a couple of years later, two blokes in Hollywood created 21 Jump Street.<br/><br/>Not one to hold a grudge, I caught a repeat screening of the updated, upgraded, upsized movie version of 21 Jump Street, staring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, with limited expectations other than some disposable fun and a rather large serving of cheese. It was worth the effort.<br/><br/>Directed by the double act of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, whose last offering was Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and written by Scott Pilgrim vs the World scribe, Michael Bacall, 21 Jump Street delivers with a cheek full of tongue and embraces its source rather than attempting to obliterate the memory of it, as so many big screen adaptations do.<br/><br/>Indeed, they make pretty damn sure we know exactly what's going on with an early line from Ice Cube's Captain Dickson as he unloads the fate of our heroes: ""You see, the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas. So all they do is recycle sh*t from the past and expect us all not to notice."" And when the hapless duo enquires where they should report, Dickson barks ""37 Jump Street. No, that doesn't sound right"" Superb! But don't think for a minute that implies 21 Jump Street isn't fresh, inventive and thoroughly enjoyable. Sit back, go with it and allow a couple of hours to pass with plenty of smiles and a sufficient quantity of eye candy.<br/><br/>The principals play variations of their usual, recognizable characters and there'll be no plaudits for acting prowess but that's not why you come to 21 Jump Street, is it? If you visit this film, and it's well worth it if you have a spare Friday evening with a pizza and a beer, you're coming for easy fun that won't stretch the brain or give you nightmares.<br/><br/>It's a simple 'buddy flick' about two failing cops who are given an opportunity to redeem themselves and answer the age-old question: What would I do if I could go back but know everything I know now? So, if you like cops, action, humour, s*x, drugs and rock 'n' roll (well, a hint of it) give it a shot. What's the worst that could happen? <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"

There's a plot onto which the jokes are glued on, and not vice versa. It works both on the meta - level (parody) as also a conventional comedy. The emotional spots and parts where it digs into the ""nerds vs. hunks"" - setting is good, and it truly rises above the material when it analyzes friendships. Acting = spot on. Jonah Hill delivers his usual goods and wisely gives more light to - applause - Tatum Channing. This guy has charisma and has managed to carve out his niche in both drama and action roles. Now he delivers an absolutely hilarious comedic performance out of the bushes. L-effin-OL. Deadpan, check. Timing, check. Also, he isn't trying to steal scenes (Will Smith- style) and is game even when his character is the butt of the jokes. Watching him is like watching an R-rated version of Joey from ""Friends"".<br/><br/>It's a bit shy on the action, but it pays off with comedy. The chemistry between Hill & Channing is exceptional so I'm really looking forward to see a sequel."

","21 Jump Street is really nice action comedy with a lot of influences by its producers, who also were starring in the film. This was Channing Tatum's first attempt in comedy and, like i've said before, it's really interesting to watch how the actor can adapt to any role. Jonah Hill on the other hand is one of the new great comedians of this new film wave. Sarcastic, smart, rebellious. They made both of the characters to learn something from each other. Successful chemistry.<br/><br/>Besides the catchy title that might take you back in the time of the TV series, this film shares only the mission of a couple of young looking police officers that are assigned to an undercover drug research in a high school, as students. Watch carefully though.. You'll find out what i mean.<br/><br/>It's a fun film with good music, fresh scenes and a rather young and talented cast. You have the right to remain silent and watch it."
"hrena16","7","2","3","2 May 2012"," 21 Jump Street exceeded my expectations
","I recently saw the movie ""21 Jump Street"" in theaters. I knew it would be funny, considering the presence of Jonah Hill as a lead role. I was initially thrown off by the overuse of mocking references to homosexuality, but the movie improved as it went on. These references never ceased, but I became accustomed to them as the story progressed, and so I was able to have an overall enjoyable experience. The movie displayed great humor and originality. It seems to be growing increasingly common for contemporary movies to have overly-predictable plot lines and unoriginal ideas. While it may not be possible for anyone to come up with a one hundred percent original plot, it is possible to have profound occurrences within the movie, which is one feat this movie accomplished. Too often in comedic movies featuring policemen, the end result is predictable and pleasing for all sides of the problem in some way. It was nice to see a fairly realistic ending, even if there were unrealistic points in the movie. The choice to place Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in their respective roles was impeccable. Each presented a distinct contribution to the movie. For Jonah, it was his somewhat nerdy, quirky energy. As for Channing, his quiet aggression, coupled with his humor really caused me to side with him at points of the movie. ""21 Jump Street"" impressed me. The most appealing aspects of this movie were its original comedic plot and its realistic approach to a zany movie topic."

","In high school, Schmidt was a dork and Jenko was the popular jock.<br/><br/>After graduation, both of them joined the police force and ended up as partners riding bicycles in the city park.<br/><br/>Since they are young and look like high school students, they are assigned to an undercover unit to infiltrate a drug ring that is supplying high school students synthetic drugs....<br/><br/>Yes it's the movie version of that TV show that hardly anyone remembers in England but made Depp a star.<br/><br/>This goes down the Starsky and Hutch route, and goes funny all the way. It works on many levels, and instead of this being a gross out comedy, which it could have clearly gone down, it goes for subtle laughs and action, and relies on the cast chemistry to make it work.<br/><br/>It's Tatums best performance, he shines in this movie and outdoes anyone on the screen. He is easily the funniest thing, which is odd, because Hill is usually very good (here he is slightly annoying).<br/><br/>The story is predictable, as is the special cameo, and this sometimes hinders the flow of the film, but although the plot and narrative can be convoluted, the spin on changing the two leads status at school is a great inclusion to the film, as is the set piece which involves the two expecting things to explode, which sounds silly, but is funny.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's a film that shouldn't be funny, but it is, thanks to some great performances and a fresh feel to it all around.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing."
"Mike_Fen","6","2","3","24 April 2012"," Falling far from the proverbial tree.
","""21 Jump Street,"" was a popular show in late 80s and early 90s. Although the characters on the show were young looking enough to pass for high school students, the tone of the show was serious; often dealing with real-life issues. Fast forward to 2012, and you get a parody of a, one- time, praised show. Much like Seth Rogans twist on ""green Hornet,"" 2012's ""21 Jump Street"" opted to make a mockery of the original work Intentional or not, the parodying of cult classic is becoming more and more unsettling. <br/><br/>As a stand alone film, this movie was not terrible. It has good use of slapstick and scatological humor, and despite having the emotional acting range of a dried up cactus, Channing Tatum's character is comedic. Perhaps this film should have gone by a different title. ""Underclassmen 2,"" as it more closely resembled the lack-luster comedy ""Underclassmen,"" starring Nick Cannon. With so many title featuring young, child, or teenage cops, you expect at least a refreshing title to go along with the already unoriginal film. <br/><br/>Overall, it was not terrible, but don't expect anything that really ties it back to the show."

Schmidt and Jenko had different experiences at high school with Jenko being the popular athlete and Schmidt being the unpopular nerd. They are allocated on a job that requires undercover work at the high school and they are required to pretend to be students.

Tatum shows us that he can do comedy and Jonah Hill just holds things together.<br/><br/>The angry black captain stereotype bit made me laugh out loud on my own. The recurring non-explosions was﻿ genius.But the best thing in the film, other than the plot, is the chemistry shared between Hill and Tatum. It was clear that since Hill co-wrote the story, there was more focus on his character of Schmidt and his journey to come out of the shell and build some self-esteem, versus Jenko having to learn what it's like being the bullied rather than the bully, and becoming exposed as being a dumb jock at every turn, if not for his sense of loyalty to build upon. But when put together, they play off each other so well that you'll look for more of their screen time together, rather than going off on their separate objectives in the same mission.<br/><br/>So this is definitely one of the funniest movies that i have seen.<br/><br/>CATCH IT!<br/><br/>See the full review: http://bit.ly/21jms"

","The movie did what it was supposed to...it makes you laugh. Needless to say, it had the value added eye candy of Channing Tatum (can he be any cuter?) I want to see him in more serious roles, the kid has potential. But if we talk about range Jonah Hill, definitely has it. You must see him in Money Ball to appreciate his charisma. The plot is lame but what do you expect? It was about laughs right? It is highly refreshing to see Ice Cube playing his bad a$$ self, as in the good old days. There's something about the way he says MOF that it is hard to emulate and from others will lack meaning. Here's my spoiler alert...that wonderful cameo of Johnny Depp, need I say more?<br/><br/>Here is what I didn't like. It was highly degrading to see the drug- dealers, gangster characters of this movie being represented as Dominicans. Thank you for all the close ups to the Dominican flag...while there is a little bit of everything in every race, this is really not what Dominicans will like to be known for...We are also the land of Oscar De La Renta, Juan Luis Guerra, Juan Marishal, Sammy Sosa among others...<br/><br/>I would like to see 10% of the profits of this movie go to an education charity in Dominican Republic. It just feel wrong to put someone's flag down in that notion. Just put yourself in the others shoes.<br/><br/>Thanks for the laughter, but more tact on the sequel...oh yeah, there will certainly be one. Watch the end."

","By the end of this movie I was ready to hop out of my seat and leave the theater. The last 20 minutes or so were definitely minutes wasted. I didn't like Ice Cube's role in this movie, although I'm sure the average person would've found his lines hilarious. In terms of the plot, it was fun and creative. I absolutely love Jonah Hill. He makes me laugh and surprisingly he didn't loose his laugh-ability since he lost weight. I loved him big though, just a cutie pie and hilarious. As for the movie, he's helps make the movie better than it would've been if he weren't starring in it. I'm not just saying that because I have a slight crush on Jonah either. This is a blockbuster for sure, but it can make for a great movie night."

","Totally pretty good. No, it's never going to win Best Picture, but it's an amusing comedy. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are both great as dumb rookie cops who are sent back to high school undercover as students. Tatum screws up and exchanges his popular kid role for Hill's nerd, and both find out how the other half lives. Dave Franco (James' younger brother) is good as the environmentally-conscious villain, and Brie Larson (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) is good as Hill's love interest. Rob Riggle and The Office's Ellie Kemper have nice roles as teachers (Chris Parnell, on the other hand, feels wasted) and Ice Cube and Nick Offerman (Parks & Recreation) are great as the officers' superiors. Sure, it's pretty sloppy, but it's funny and clever where it counts."
"jaxbubba","7","2","3","9 April 2012"," I liked it, I really really liked it.....
","Though I am not a huge fan of old TV series being turned into movies, and I am definitely not a fan of actor Channing Tatum... I have to say that everything in this film works!!!! The casting of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as two bumbling cops forced to go undercover as high school students was a good idea which I would have never thought of in a hundred years; however, the truly genius twist was to make Hill (Schmidt - the smart guy) the popular kid and Tatum (Jenko - the ex-jock) the nerdy geek. The scenes are funny, and well written. The plot of the film centers on an illegal drug ring in a local high school, in which out two heroes must infiltrate to uncover the drug's source and dealers. However, the best scene of the film has to be the cameo appearances of the show's original cast members at the film's climax, it was truly unexpected. Ice Cube was a brilliant choice for Captain Dickson, and plays the hard-ass Jump Street Team Chief with reckless abandonment. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller's plan to make this film into a comedy was a stroke of genius as well; while both Hill and Tatum compliment each other's acting style really well. Kudos to all involved, I highly recommend this film and found it quite enjoyable. SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWSAT 'THE FARIS REEL' ON FACEBOOK."
"Thomas-Giffin","7","2","3","2 April 2012"," A funny, touching film
","Through intense and extensive research, I discovered that the film 21 Jump Street is based on a television show of the same name that ran from 1987 for four years and starred a young and quote 'disarmingly handsome' Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The tone of the original show was dramatic. A series about cops posing as high school students has the potential for comedy but the show ran the premise straight and (in some cases) hard hitting about social issues of the day involving children and schools. <br/><br/>The film has an identical premise, undercover po-leece in high school but unlike the TV show, the film is an out and out comedy. This works heavily in the film's favour, firstly the film retreads the ground of the show from a completely new direction, so it never feels old fashioned or out of touch. Secondly, whilst the film is a touching homage to the television show, the comedy element is drawn from the changes between schools (and kids) now and then. Where the bullying jock character was king of hill when he was in school, he now finds himself out of place among the eco-friendly, alternative kids of today. By reversal, the bullied nerd finds himself a new place at the head of the table in schools today.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, the two leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum create a touching relationship between themselves. Between the comedy is actually a real friendship and a strong emotional core which anchors the narrative. The film would not be half as successful if either of the two leads were not as good as they are. Even though it is obvious that Hill is the better of the two actors in a comedic sense of the word, Tatum is still human enough to support his side to an equally high standard. <br/><br/>Ice Cube has the best lines in the film and every scene he is in ranks amongst the film's best. His Capt. Dickson is both hilarious, gets great lines and turns an entire trope (the angry, black captain) on its head. <br/><br/>The film has action scenes and these are as well done, as absurd and as over the top as they were in Pineapple Express. A car chase seems bizarrely placed in the film but it highlights and parodies several action clichés and doesn't detract from the film at all. The gunfights are well done (surprisingly so) and are funny due to inherent misplacement within the film. They don't belong in the film and are played dead straight and they work.<br/><br/>Overall though, the film is consistently funny and very entertaining to watch, I was surprised at the rating they were aiming for (15 in the UK) and they managed to fit an awful lot of language, drinks, drugs and violence into that rating. It's never nasty or malicious but always good fun. Add on top of this a well-documented cameo from two original actors (Depp and Peter DeLuise) and you realise that the film is a fine and loving remodeling of the original show in a similar vein to Starsky and Hutch but unlike that film, 21 Jump Street actually attempts to go in a different direction and therefore break new ground."
"dommercaldi","8","1","1","8 April 2020"," Laugh-Out-Loud Family Fun
","Pros:
1. The comedy is of entirely laugh-out-loud quality and it never fails to produce a laugh.
2. The film knows when and how to appropriately insert tender moments which add to the dynamic between the two protagonists.
3. There is fantastic chemistry between Jonah Hill (Schmidt) and Channing Tatum (Jenko).
4. Both Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill give brilliant comedic performances, with Ice Cube (Captain Dickson) offering up a very good side performance.
5. The movie does a good job at presenting the changes between high school generations, especially with Schmidt and Jenko finding themselves in inverse social statuses to the ones they had assumed in their high school days.
6. The score, though nothing special, performs well to add to the atmosphere it's played in - whether it be during an action scene, or an emotional one.
7. Both Schmidt and Jenko have nice little character arcs with Jenko becoming more knowledgeable and responsible, and and Schmidt becoming more confident and freer.
8. The pacing is great despite it's paper-thin plot.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. Somehow Schmidt and Jenko pass for high-schoolers even though they look way older.
2. The film sets up a bizarre romantic relationship between Schmidt and Molly Tracey (Brie Larson) even though it's wholly inappropriate considering the age-gap.
3. Some of the editing is a little obnoxious."

A really funny film for the most part, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill play off each other beautifully and a good cast of supporting characters.<br/><br/>The story pokes fun at the original concept, and the appearance of the original 21 Jump Street stars (including Johnny Depp) is a hoot. The only thing I didn't quite get was the abusive boss, played by Ice Cube, he's usually really good but this one didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The movie slows a bit in the second half, and the attempts at mild melodrama fall a bit flat, but overall it's a pretty enjoyable ride."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","1","13 October 2018"," Surprisingly effective for a reboot of a TV show
","Generally speaking, you'd be right to be skeptical about the quality of a reboot of a largely forgotten TV show from the 1980's. Personally, I've never even seen the original show, let alone remember it fondly. Then again, perhaps it's this unfamiliarity that makes the movie seem somewhat unique. Also, treating the premise with a much more a comedic touch helps to counteract its inherent implausibility.<br/><br/>For those unaware of the movie's premise, it's that a pair of young cops (Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill) are given an undercover assignment at a local high school with the goal of taking down a drug ring. It's a simple set-up but, as I said before, one that's fairly unique. Played straight, this probably wouldn't work but when treated as an action comedy there's loads of potential. What particularly makes the movie work is its self-referential style that plays with movie conventions. That being said, even while sending up cop movie cliches, the movie still functions as an entertaining crime movie.<br/><br/>Much of the credit goes to the two seemingly mismatched leads - Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill. Tatum is, of course, the more stereotypical choice to play a cop but he actually shows an unexpected flair for comedy as well. Jonah Hill's comedic chops are well known but, most importantly, he & Tatum have excellent chemistry together. This doesn't just apply to the comedic side of the movie, either. The relationship between the two characters is a driving force throughout the entire movie. Apart from the leads, there's some notable talent in supporting roles as well. Future Oscar winner Brie Larson plays a prominent role, as does Dave Franco. Ice Cube, Nick Offerman & Rob Riggle are among the supporting players that strengthen the movie's comedic punch. Lastly, there's a unexpected cameo appearance that's too good to spoil.<br/><br/>Directors Phil Lord & Christopher Miller did a nice job in their live action debut, having previously directed the animated movie ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" and the short-lived (but memorable) TV show ""Clone High"". The movie doesn't show any signs of inexperience. Instead, it shows a keen grasp of comedy along with enough technique to lend credibility to the parodies of buddy cop movies. The music is also nicely done with a score by Devo vet Mark Mothersbaugh supplemented by a well chosen soundtrack.<br/><br/>All in all, ""21 Jump Street"" is a surprisingly good comedy, especially when compared to other TV show adaptations (like the similarly styled ""Baywatch""). Energetic direction, a self-referential tone and a pair of engaging leads make the movie work both as a comedy and a buddy cop movie. The sequel is also a worthwhile effort in the same vein, although in that case the self-reference struggles a bit to overcome the sense of 'been there, done that'."

I actually found this to be rather hilarious and laughed more than 3 times (I think that's a record?). It was good fun!! It knew exactly what it wanted to be and succeeded fantastically. A pair of police officers (who are the worst cops ever, no hyperbole) go undercover in a high school to bust a drug ring. This drug when taken has four unique phases which are portrayed on multiple occasions. They were funny as flip! Phase 2 is the greatest, massive props to the guy who envisaged those hallucinations. The story is actually well-rounded, the role reversal of our lead characters was a pleasant watch. The contrast of cliques from their past school life to the present made for some funny moments. I like the involvement of these cliques, the nerds were useful as opposed to just being picked on. The forced scenes of ""yayyyy friendship is important"" are quite cringe-worthy and didn't flow with the rest of the narrative. Channing Tatum was excellent, probably the first comedic role I've seen him in and he nailed it. Jonah Hill, who I notoriously dislike, was actually...dare I say...watchable. Now now, before you say ""you finally like him Luke!"" I still found him unfunny compared to Tatum, but he was tolerable. Brie Larson, Dave Franco and Ice Cube were also decent. A nice surprise towards the end as well. The action scenes were filmed with some exhilaration, particularly the limousine chase. I thought the editing had visual flair, reminded me of Edgar Wright. The soundtrack cutting out during a joke or the quick jump cuts to emphasise something (like the explosion opportunities in the freeway car chase). Honestly I didn't want to like this, but I had a really fun time and found it to be extremely watchable."

","After watching the absolutely appalling movie that was CHiPs a part of me wanted to see another movie that was based on a popular cop show from the eighties, and fortunately I happened to have this one in my collection. Okay, while it might not have the drawing power of Johnny Depp and Lou Diamond Phillips (and I'm sorry, but Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum simply do not come close) a part of me felt that maybe, just maybe, it would be a little better that that previous movie that I wasted $10.00 to see (and money that I simply won't be getting back again). Oh, and a colleague also highly recommended it.<br/><br/>Well, I have to admit that it was much, much better than that other travesty of a movie, though like CHiPs, it also turned what was originally a somewhat serious series into something that was much more humorous. Also, it also wasn't ashamed to with poking fun at itself (such as referring to it as another pointless attempt to resurrect a defunct project from the 80s). In a sense it seems that a lot of these attempts to resurrect a classic 80s series are doing so with a lot more humour than the original series had.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with the original series then you will know what this film is about – a couple of cops who look rather young (or are supposed to look rather young, and once again the film actually pokes fun at the ridiculous nature of this concept by pointing out that Channing Tatum really doesn't look like a high school student because he is way too old) are given an assignment to go undercover into a high school in an attempt to bust open a drug ring. The thing is that our heroes are actually a couple of goofups, one of them being pretty smart but having no physical skills whatsoever, and the other being a tough guy but basically being as thick as a brick.<br/><br/>The other rather amusing thing about this film is how the nature of school has changed. Mind you, a part of me finds that this concept of the school being taken over by geeks, lefties, and those of the alternate lifestyle, still seems to be rather unrealistic. While the film pokes fun at how the world has changed a lot since I was in high school, a part of me feels that the public schools are still run by the jocks, while the private schools are still run by the rich kids. In a way it seems as if what was being portrayed here was more in line with what one would expect from university as opposed to high school, though even then that is probably stretching things a little too far.<br/><br/>As for the film, well, I have to admit that I did really enjoy it. One of the things it does explore is how life in high school and life in the real world are two completely different things. While one might be seen as a geek in high school, once one leaves high school and enters the real world things end up changing, and changing a lot. In fact what we see here is that the roles are suddenly reversed. In my experience I have known lots of people who, when they were in high school, were considered geeks and weren't a part of the in crowd, once they left they found themselves as not only the centre of attention, but also as being the hip and cool people. In many cases, while the jocks might be the cool people in high school, once it is over they are more likely than not to disappear into obscurity (as was the case with many of the people I went to school with)."
"Marthian80","7","1","1","15 November 2016"," Hilarious movie that makes fun of everything, including itself
","Going into this film, I was a bit skeptic. I'm not a fan of most American 'modern' comedies and I dislike high school comedies in general, so I expected to dislike this one to. But fortunately I was pleasantly surprised! <br/><br/>The movie kicks of with both Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) in high school, were Schmidt is being the big loser and Jenko the super popular kid. Fast forward 7 years and we both find them training to be a cop. Since Jenko has the mussel but lacks the brains, he teams up with Schmidt who scores A's on the theory but lacks the physical strength. They both made it to be police officers but when they screw over their first arrest, because Jenko couldn't remember the rights he has to read to the guy he arrests :D, they are send to 21 Jump Street for a 'special mission'. Here we meet Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who assigns them to be undercover cops in a high school, to act like high school students and find out were these new lethal drugs are coming from. Hilarity starts when they have their roles reversed and Jenko is stuck with the nerds and Schmidt is suddenly a very popular guy. Will the two still remember to actually act as cops and solve the drug dealer problem or just relive their high school years? <br/><br/>The funniest thing about 21 Jump Street is that both Jenko and Schmidt don't look like teenagers at all which causes all kind of weird situations. It's hilarious when they try to blend in but fail utterly because it isn't 2005 anymore. I like how they mix typical high school humor with police movie clichés and make fun of both genres.<br/><br/>I liked both Hill and Tatum in this one, there was good chemistry between the characters and they really looked like partners. The supporting cast also did a good job, especially Rob Riggle as the crazy Mr. Walters. I'm having the opinion that Ice Cube cannot act, but he was descent in this movie. And it was hard to screw up the part he had, just swear a lot should be easy for a guy like him, right? (He is also referenced in the soundtrack in the form of a N.W.A. track) <br/><br/>The only problems I had with this movie is that I didn't like the parts were there is to much high school stuff going on and in the final act the movie get's slightly more serious. But the action scenes are great, especially the car chase with Jonah Hill dressed as Peter Pan.. :P I also could do with less dick jokes but hey, it's still an American comedy.. ;) <br/><br/>So do check this one out if you could use a laugh and love to see some action as well."
"Cjalln1","7","1","1","17 August 2015"," Simultaneously a typical and innovative comedy film
","Sticking closely to American high-school-movie tropes while simultaneously mocking them is one of the most salient triumphs of ""21 Jump Street"". Stoner humour is prevalent, swear words are numerous and lashings of typical US slapstick are shovelled in. By making two loser cops graduate high school again, ""21 Jump Street"" satirises the teen-scene film movement: Jenko and Schmidt have the ability to relive (respectively) the best and worst years of their lives, an opportunity which many would secretly relish. The interest in high-school movies throughout the 80's, provoked by a vicarious yearning to be cool or do things differently, is picked apart here as they realise that everything they knew about high school has changed. The athletic layabouts have been superseded in popularity by intelligent, sensitive and environmentally-conscious teenagers, much to Schmidt's delight and Jenko's chagrin. Their struggle to be accepted becomes more and more consuming as they begin to get distracted from their undercover mission, although any serious moments are often overlooked in favour of easy laughs. The film makes no secret of stupidity – the idiocy of the protagonists is exploited for full comedic effect as their bumbling Inspector Clouseau-esque investigations lead them, more by accident than design, to discover the distributors of high-school drugs in the wafer-thin plot. The shallow genre-mockery would be easily missed by the casual viewer, were it not for one of the best credits sequences I have ever seen: explosions, women's silhouettes and American flags cloak the screen behind a set of polished-metal acting credits in a flagrant action-blockbuster spoof. Self-mockery, showy cinematography and a poor (yet extremely quotable) script render ""Jump Street"" the ""Hot Fuzz"" of American comedies, albeit without the cult following.<br/><br/>Music in the film is used primarily to add to the comedy, and although all actors are strong in their roles, there is a sense of tired cliché in the characters of Jonah Hill's awkward geek and Channing Tatum's brooding dullard jock. However, as a reboot of a long-forgotten TV serial, it stays true to its roots – references to the original series pop up in all forms, including the cameos of original actor Johnny Depp, even if most of the allusions would be overlooked by viewers unfamiliar with the series. <br/><br/>There is more to ""21 Jump Street"" than meets the eye, but not a lot more. Its stand-out qualities are the subtle mocking of asinine blockbuster action-comedies, and the exploitation of the ""ideal high-school experience"" story concept. Other than this, the film is simply an enjoyable romp full of unpredictable violence and cringe- worthy awkward moments – and it is truly funny."

","21 Jump Street (2012): Dir: Phil Lord, Chris Miller / Cast: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Ice Cube: Update of the classic TV show that starred Johnny Depp. It is a place of corruption as two young police recruits, played by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are sent undercover to smoke out a drug ring. After the initial concept the screenplays descends into formula, which consists mainly of drug and drunken jokes until arriving at a familiar climax where a beloved damsel must be saved within a car chase. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller pull off some effective action scenes but the film is nothing more than a drunken update. Hill and Tatum pull through with many funny moments that do not save the film. They enter with fake names yet they manage to screw that up. That leaves the generally smart Hill entered into a Peter Pan play, while the athletic Tatum is stuck in chemistry class where the teacher drools over him. Brie Larson is given the thankless role of teenage damsel. She will obviously become disappointed when Hill's true nature is revealed but upon rescue it is all dim predictable rubbish. Dave Franco plays the young student drug peddler whom the guys must earn trust of in order to learn who his contacts are. Ice Cube as their captain is also the standard one dimensional figure who dishes out the orders. There are a couple great cameo appearances but that is the height of surprise as this becomes the latest in teen shame. Films like this can work if the issues at hand are addressed, but this screenplays jumps more than streets to present lifestyles teens should avoid. Score: 5 / 10"

","Two friends and police officers are getting into the 21 jump street team, a police team that organizes under covered missions. The two men must post as high school students in order to find out who is selling lethal drugs to the students. However things doesn't go exactly as they supposed to. I watched 22 jump street first, so the 21 jump street seemed to me as a better, funnier and more successful movie. Apart from the constant cursing, which gets tiring after a while, the last scene with the old jump street members re appearing and getting killed, the fake nose and the inability to shoot the gun, apart from all that, it is a great comedy. To be honest, it is funny without trying too hard. Some of the movies that pass for comedies today are using too many sexual references and verbal abuse in order to make you laugh. But this film it's more original. Sure they do use them, but in a more normal level without overdoing it. The performances are okay, nothing extraordinary, the plot good enough and the action scenes as many as they should. So, for all that, I give 21 jump street a 6 out of 10."

","I don't like either of the actors in this movie. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are not actors that appeal to me. I wasn't a big fan of the original 21 jump street although I am thankful for it because it helped launch the career of the beautiful Holly Robinson Peete.<br/><br/>In this movie two young looking cops are placed on an undercover detail as high school students. Their objective is to infiltrate a drug gang and find the source. It's a buddy movie with unlikely buddies, the chubby dorky character and the muscular handsome character become friends despite their differences, and in fact their differences complement each other.<br/><br/>In one scene is the obligatory awesome partaaaaay that is in every high school movie. I don't remember parties like that when I was in high school, but then again hey if they made movies about my normal high school experience, no one would come to see them. But I digress. It's a fun movie. The characters have some unexpected hi jinx and of course what would a cop movie be without the sergeant yelling at them constantly and at one point they actually got kicked off the force. I think that's a requirement for every cop movie.<br/><br/>I didn't find it to be a great movie.

","Sometimes I find that the best films I see are those I know nothing about. Apparently, 21 Jump Street was based on a TV show from... (I don't know when, but it was, apparently). Anyway, I've never seen it, so I can't say how faithful the film was, compared to the TV series. Either way, it doesn't matter. The point is I knew nothing about the film and watched it anyway.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>It's about two high school clichés - the nerd and the jock, spending their youth hating each other, only to become best friends when they both enrol in police training school. Then, after a botched bust, they're recruited by '21 Jump Street' to go undercover back to high school and crack a major drugs ring.<br/><br/>Based on the plot, I would say it sounded average. However, it does have one ingredient that most modern Hollywood comedies seem to be lacking these days - it's actually funny! I don't know why it is, but it is. Something about it just works. I think it's best not to try and overanalyse a film like this. If you do, you'll end up finding plot holes and ripping it apart for no good reason.<br/><br/>Just go with some adult humour and plenty of silliness (and watch out for the unexpected cameo near the end - okay, so if you know the TV series, maybe you're expecting it - but I wasn't, okay?)."

"ahegde3149","6","1","1","12 January 2015"," Quite entertaining, didn't disappoint
","Comedy is not among my more preferred genres. Its my choice mostly when I am stressed out or bored for refreshing my mind. Starting with 21 Jump Street I was ready to just have some fun whether it made much sense or not. In the end I was quite surprised the movie really invested me in its story not only catching with its gags. It starts off a bit slow but gradually transforms into a fun action- comedy ride.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street involves story of two cop-buddies Scmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Chaning Tatum) who are assigned an undercover operation to track down drug dealers and suppliers at their own high school where they had studied. Schmidt is more of a nerd type while Jenko falls into cool handsome guy category still they became very good friends while training at Police Academy. Well there is nothing special about the story, its easy to see the direction in which its heading. Yet the movie is able to put forth a nice enjoyable chemistry between its lead pair. There were some moments involving both of them that were genuinely heart warming which was hugely surprising. Ice Cube who plays the head of the undercover division is also pretty entertaining. Additionally Dave Franco and Brie Larson have smaller roles as students. Romance gets added which wasn't quite the right tone. There is also lot of action with guns firing and car chases but its all balanced out nicely. Among the most funny scenes I would say was the whole driving-school car sequence. There were some really laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>In the climax there is stunning cameo which I did not see coming from any possible angle. I wont say a word about it, enjoy it on your own. The soundtrack and music suit the atmosphere and theme perfectly. But I felt a little problem with flow of the scenes, there are some sudden change from a comic aspect to emotional or romantic one. Lot of profanity is involved much of it seems to be there just to sound cool without making any sense. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller keep film nicely paced without much putting burden over the climax. In the end I wasn't disappointed and had some good laughs. <br/><br/>RATING: [3/5]"

You saw a glimpse of the high-school lives of the two main characters, who were the opposite of each other(the geek and the cool kid), and before you knew it they were cops and, most surprising, good friends. I could live with the fact that these are no in depth characters, because I did't had any expectations of a good thought-out storyline. I laughed several times, but mostly about jokes which had nothing to do with the story. And all those jokes were not part of a composite. Laughing was therefore the only emotional expression that occurred to me while watching the film. I find it very hard to see other aspects of this film worthwhile to discuss in a review. The movie's only purpose is to make people laugh and it succeeded on my case.<br/><br/>That's why my vote is only based on the moments I laughed out loud: six times"

Jonah Hill is a funny guy anyway so I expected a reasonable performance from him but there were good performances all around. I think the movie did well to poke fun at itself along the way, it provided some genuinely funny moments.<br/><br/>The movie did fall into predictability towards the end.

Seldom did I get interested in the plot, but the ""comedy"" part was OK, it wasn't brilliant, but laughable in a kind of good way. The plot was not just not interesting, but very poor, so do not expect the writers to come up with some major plot twist or anything that could confuse the audience because the only thing they do is putting some jokes to make it seems less bad.

I had never seen anything with Channing Tatum, so I do not know if his super low-key approach is the part or the actor. The pair have reasonably good chemistry together. The main hook appears to be how the two have reversed roles from their actual high school days, to their undercover assignment, and both seem to realize the emptiness and limitations of the other.

"james-t-sheridan","7","1","1","1 August 2012"," Better than you think it would be
","The new Channing Tatum-Jonah Hill buddy cop retro-television show reboot 21 Jump Street pays homage to a world of mid-eighties undercover police activity where a young Johnny Depp went undercover in a local high school in order to infiltrate gangs, bust drug activity, and expose what was really going on in America's high schools. I think. I don't know because I never watched 21 Jump Street, partly because I was a little too young for it, partly because it never outweighed my desire to watch Cheers or Night Court on WGN. And Hunter. And some of that weird Nick-At-Nite stuff I watched. It wasn't a show my parents watched (that was Wiseguy, L.A. Law), and I don't have any preconceived notions going into this film besides the fact that historically, not many films made from television shows happen to be very memorable or strong. Of course, there was Goodfellas made from Wiseguy, and I'm a fan of Michael Mann's brooding, moody Miami Vice with Colin Farrell and Jaime Foxx, though I don't think that anyone else is. The Flintstones was no good, I saw unpromising portions of the A-Team, and I'm still waiting on NYPD Blue: The Movie. However, the concept of recycling an 80's television show, stripping it down to its essential parts, and rotating in bright, funny actors works splendidly in this film, one of the best comedies of the year so far. <br/><br/>21 Jump Street, directed by two men and having five writing/story credits, feels like a bit of a mishmash, a stew of graphic violence, wonderful obscenity, nonsensical car chases, skilled high school satire, funny moments with Ice Cube as Captain Dickson who supervises the undercovers, as well as some very physical comedy involving Tatum and Hill. As a stew of a film, 21 Jump Street works because at its core it is funny. It made me laugh quite a bit, and the interplay, the chemistry, the bond between Jonah Hill as Schmidt and Channing Tatum as Jenko works. They both are having a really good time making this film, riffing off of each other, sliding over cars, pumping shotguns, wearing tuxes to prom, and playing two characters who deeply desire a chance to redo high school. <br/><br/>There is the strange sight of a guy who looks like James Franco, talks like James Franco, but isn't James Franco (played by his brother Dave Franco). There are biker gangs and potent drugs, a forgettable female supporting character that seems an afterthought in a bromance of this kind. There is the wonderful Rob Riggle as an inappropriate coach, a fun, raunchy Ellie Kemper as a teacher, and the always entertaining Nick Offerman as a stoic Deputy Chief who after chewing the leads out for botching an arrest by not knowing the Miranda Rights (""Did you just say you have the right to be an attorney?"") announces, ""We're reviving a canceled undercover project from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they've run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle **** from the past and hope that nobody will notice."" A hilarious line reading by Offerman, but by getting in front of this concept, taking the air out of its criticism, the film smartly allows itself the possibility of being wry and self-aware of its own ridiculousness and origins. Similarly, the brilliant move to switch Schmidt and Jenko's roles in high school results in some of the best moments in the film as Hill plays the jock and Tatum, the brains: Schmidt's leaping through the air as Peter Pan in a theater production; Jenko announcing ""Kneel before Zod!"" to enter the Science nerds lab room where he struggles to understand covalent bonds; Schmidt's faux- aggressiveness as he takes center stage in a social scene he would have hidden from in high school as well as his supposed Track prowess. The jealousy between the characters is fun, a party scene and its aftermath have their moments, and the level of fun that the directors, writers, and cast seem to be having is palpable. Tatum is a good actor and quite funny, and Hill continues to do his fast-talking thing, which is richly comedic. What a fun pairing of talents. <br/><br/>A comedy is supposed to make you laugh, and 21 Jump Street delivers. Fun lead chemistry and raw, dark humor mix together in an addictive way. With little to no expectations going in (and zero investment because I never watched the show), I was pleasantly surprised. Recommended."

Hell, let's watch some things explode, shall we?<br/><br/>What I figured out after a few minutes was that whoever made this thing knew that lots of people would be thinking pretty much that. It's been a while since I've seen movie-making done with such glee at screwing with the audience. It was the best facet of the film, but I admit that I just like self-referential humor when done well, and here, that's what happened.<br/><br/>That said, I couldn't get into the relationship between Hill and Tatum, and I still don't like Jonah Hill. However, I do like Channing Tatum more now, since he had the good taste to allow himself to be a complete boob when necessary here. With a little work, he might yet prove himself to be more than a lighter-haired clone of Josh Hartnett, with all the rom-com crap that implies. <br/><br/>Huge parts of the story were absurd, so if that can't wash for you, then don't watch this movie.

Thankfully, we're not going to have to watch two failed movie actors accepting a career in television (in the case of Hawaii 5-O), as 21 Jump Street has been given a full- blown movie, and rather than following the same tone and style as its predecessor, Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall have written as an absurd action-comedy, taking a giant gamble and casting heart-throb Channing Tatum, an actor that has looked more comfortable in recent years in action films and romantic comedies.<br/><br/>Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are two recent police graduates who became best friends in helping each through their own difficulties during the police examinations. In high school, just seven years earlier, Schmidt was a nerd who dressed as Eminem (""not-so-Slim Shady""), and Jenko was the long-haired popular jock. After a failed drug bust, the two are assigned to a recently re-instated program that was cancelled in the 80's (get it?), and are shipped off to 21 Jump Street to play undercover at a local high school that has seen an influx of a new hallucinogenic drug. To their surprise, they find that the politics of high school have changed, and now the nerds rule, and the jocks are the ones that don't fit in (Jenko blames recent TV shows, ""f**k you, Glee!""). With Schmidt seeing his new popularity as a way to re-live his high school days the way he would have wanted, his friendship with Jenko suffers, as does their drug operation.<br/><br/>Given the recent comedy disappointments that have starred the likes of Jonah Hill and his posse, I wasn't expecting much more than a few titters from 21 Jump Street. To my surprise, the film is actually hilarious, thanks to a witty, smut-filled script, some fast-paced action scenes, and real chemistry between the two leads. It also plays out like a love-letter to the 1980's, where mismatched-buddy action comedies seemed to be out every other week, and is wise enough to be well aware of this, embracing the clichés of the genre (during a high speed chase, there is a nice running joke about vehicles not exploding as they would usually in movies, and Ice Cube plays the obligatory angry black captain - ""I'm black, and occasionally I get angry!"").<br/><br/>Hill, love him or hate him (I tend to be in the former category) gives the performance you would expect - nervous, foul-mouthed, and wasting no opportunity to make a clever pop culture reference - and it's interesting how he makes the audience almost despise the nerd when we are so used to them being the sympathetic character. Tatum is the film's trump card, proving a brilliant comedy actor, and does not simply play the straight man to Hill's funny man. Jenko is big, handsome and stupid (in the opening calamitous drug bust he forgets the Miranda rights -""you have the right to... suck my d**k, motherf****r!), yet he has a big heart, bonding with some science nerds to both infiltrate a dealer and to learn about science.<br/><br/>The jokes are about as crude and as vulgar as I've heard for a while. There are as many c**k jokes than there are sight gags, often blending the two together- a funny scene sees Jenko childishly doing ridiculous sex positions with a toy giraffe on Schmidt as he talks to his potential girlfriend on the phone. But if you can stomach the smut and would find the lead characters tripping their balls off on drugs funny, then there's plenty of fun to be had here, as at its core there is a lot of heart. Fans of the original show are in for a treat too, as there is an inspired revelation at the end, as well as homages and references to the series and the era in general (""I look like Fred Savage in the Wonder Years, only naked!""). A film that proves that taking an old idea and re- doing it can work, as long as your wise enough to make it seem fresh.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"Christian_Dimartino","7","1","1","14 July 2012"," Surprisingly funny.
","I'll admit that i'm not a fan of Jonah Hill. Ever since his obnoxiously perverted turn in Superbad, I haven't been able to get that image of him out of my head. So, for that reason, and because they turned a classic drama series into a comedy, I was not looking forward to 21 Jump Street. And if you were thinking what I was thinking, you might end up surprised.<br/><br/>So, here's the premise: Two cops(Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum), who grew up hating each other, end up partners, but of course they're not very good at their job. Soon, they are sent on a mission: Pose as high school kids and find out who is selling this new exotic drug that killed a kid.<br/><br/>Even though the premise was used in a 90's movie called Never Been Kissed, the movie is still fun for the first hour and ten minutes. But in the final act, I started losing interest. I begin to lose interest when there is an extended action sequence, and that is the case for The Avengers.<br/><br/>I started liking the film from it's opening ten minutes. But if they were doing a 21 Jump Street movie, they should'nt have made it a comedy. They should've just made it the comedy that it is, and take out whatever references to the show they make. Tatum and Hill do make a good team, and Hill earned my respect a little. But hey, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I've read that he is going to be in Martin Scorsese's next movie, The Wolf on Wall Street, but come on, he doesn't deserve it.<br/><br/>B"

","I was unsure of 21 Jump Street at first, not really caring if I ever watched it or not. After a friend told me how funny it was and I should check it out I decided to give it a shot and i'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Jonan Hill and Channing Tatum are hilarious together, and seeing Ice Cube working for the police department is great on its on. The mix of action and comedy is well balanced and the cast are excellent in there roles.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill are cops who go undercover as high school students in order to find dealers and supplier of a new drug that is taking over the high school. Can these best friends survive another run at high school or will it destroy the bond between them? If your a fan of comedy I highly recommend this film."
"vintkd","6","1","1","5 July 2012"," I didn't like that movie but it has many great jokes!!!
","I didn't like that movie but it has many great jokes, definitely. I have never seen old TV series ""21 Jump Street"" with Johnny Depp and I can't compare its with the new version unfortunately. In my glance, main disadvantage of that film is vulgar humor that irritates me strongly. After every really funny joke next appearing three silly and it's regrettable because there are good plot, good actors but it seems to me some jokes in this film written special for morons. Why? I don't understand. I'm not a prude, I like Kevin Smith, American Pie for example, but everything should be in moderation and harmoniously. ""21 Jump Street"" is clearly not that case, unfortunately."
"MadameGeorge","7","1","1","5 July 2012"," Funny- to the point of Tears
","I waited for 21 Jump Street to come to the local video stop and after watching it, I will not do that with the sequel that is coming.<br/><br/>This was the first film that I have seen Channing Tatum in and he was great. I am not a fan of his looks (I know, I know) but what impressed me is that for a so call 'pretty boy' he made the film. Tatum has the look of a rookie policeman and definitely the look of the jock in high-school so the casting was spot on. I did not expect his acting ability with his funny one lines, startled facial expressions and mingling with the computer nerds- he clearly is out of place in those scenes, but he makes it work somehow. Bravo Mr. Tatum.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill I like- to a point. I enjoyed him in 'Moneyball' and thought he was a likable slacker in 'Superbad' however, in '21' his performance seems almost forced? I think, and it pains me to say this, that Tatum out smarted him and out shined him. Hill walks the line between wanting to be the cool kid for once and being the nerd, which is one of the plot points to the movie. Hill did not fall flat at all, he just was not his usual hilarious self that I have seen in other films and I think it was a missed opportunity for him to a certain extent. The relationship between Hill and Tatum is excellent and somehow Tatum is the one that pulls the weight.<br/><br/>The minor characters I enjoyed, especially that of cutie Dave Franco. I did not go in to this movie knowing all the supporting characters, but I really like his performance, the prom scene is particular great. Franco is not just a pretty face, must run in the family. Ice Cube was hilarious as the captain and the few scenes that Ellie Kemper was in were great.<br/><br/>The only problem that I thought slowed down the entire movie was the last scene in which the cameos occurred. I know that a lot of people were excited to learn of the famous cast of '21' appearing in the new film, but I thought it was not needed and only put in there for those of the older generation. I am not in this school- '21' was not on the air when I was growing up so I thought it was really weird that these few cameos were necessary.<br/><br/>There is a lot of swearing, reference to drugs and alcohol and a few quick scenes of sexual situations and one ridiculous sexual scene that was added for shock I guess. This is a film for the older young adults.<br/><br/>Great cast, great music, great concept of moving on and letting go of life in high school."

","Schmidt and Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum respectively) are two newish bike cops whom are tasked by the '21 Jump Street' program with infiltrating a high school disguised as students and bust a new drug ring, in this comedy based on Stephen J. Cannell's hit late 1980's Fox cop show.<br/><br/>Well this exceeded expectations, granted truth be told expectations were a tad bit low when I learned of a comedic rendition of a decidedly non-comedic TV show. However surprisingly the film is a great mix of low-brow, high-concept and self-referential humor that made it a joy to watch. With past Cannell shows hitting the big screen with A-Team and now 21 Jump Street, one can only hope that ""The Greatest American Hero"" would get the treatment next. Now THAT would be epic. <br/><br/>My Grade: B"
"ultness","7","1","1","5 April 2012"," A Cross Between Never Been Kissed and The Other Guys.
","To say that Jonah Hill is experiencing a surge in his career would be an understatement. His first Oscar nomination for Moneyball has taken him from lovable ""foulmouthed, fat-kid"" to more of a well-rounded, respected actor. Being that he is one of the best young comedic actors in Hollywood, it is only natural that Hill would find his first post-nom performance to be in the comedy-reboot 21 Jump Street, a film that he co-wrote. We have seen his contemporaries Seth Rogen and Jason Segel attempt their own reboot-passion projects (The Green Hornet and The Muppets respectively) with varying success, and now it's Jonah's turn. 21 Jump Street has the unenviable task of either setting the table for comedy films of 2012 or becoming another failed rehash of property from decades past.<br/><br/>If you have seen any of the trailers for this film, then the premise is rather straight-forward. Two young guys, Schmidt and Jenko (played by Hill and Tatum), who were at opposite ends of the social spectrum in high school become inadequate cops and best friends a decade later and are forced into an undercover division to track down drug use in a local high school. The movie is loosely based on the 80s television show of the same name (the very same show that introduced Johnny Depp to the masses) but is really more of a cross between the 1999 Drew Barrymore-starred flick Never Been Kissed and the recent Farrell/Wahlberg buddy-cop film The Other Guys.<br/><br/>The heart of a ""buddy cop"" film is the chemistry between the co-leads. If their bond isn't strong, then the audience has trouble buying into the film. Though I have always enjoyed the work of Jonah Hill (even in oddball turns such as in Strange Wilderness), I have never held a fondness toward Channing Tatum. Tatum has always seemed to be a hollow, under-actor who skates by on his model-looks. 21 Jump Street has improved his stance with me. Chalk it up to strong dialogue or working with a veteran comic actor in Hill but Tatum actually resembles an ACTOR in this film. There isn't any underacting or mumble-fumbling through dialogue. The audience actually sees an actor that appears to be enjoying what he is doing and in-turn produces a fun character. (Now let's see what he can do under the direction of Steven Soderbergh later this year in Magic Mike.) Outside of the leads, the film contains your everyday menagerie of characters: the love interest played by Brie Larson, the cool kid played by Dave Franco, the angry captain of the undercover division played by Ice Cube, and Rob Riggle as Rob Riggle. All of these characters are one-note or barely go beyond it. Larson does a solid job at building her acting resume and Riggle provides his expected outlandish moments. Ice Cube was the real disappointment as I was hoping for a little more out of his character, but alas, I think the draw of his role is seeing a former NWA member playing a police captain. Ellie Kemper of Bridesmaids fame was the only true stand-out to me. Her horny school-girl-like teacher character, ""Ms. Griggs,"" provides some brief, but hilarious moments opposite Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>The writing of a comedy is as important to its success as its leads and 21 Jump Street's far exceeded my expectations. What I assumed would be a film riddled with sex jokes and toilet humor was instead a self-aware script filled with funny dialogue exchanges and well-executed situations. (The first day of school for Schmidt and Jenko's undercover mission being one of the best moments). The film also understands that it is ""based"" on an older property and, at points, nearly breaks the fourth wall in exposing this fact. These moments were welcomed by me and helped to give the film its own identity.<br/><br/>Being that it is a buddy-cop film, there are also some moments of cheesy emotion. The emotion doesn't show up full-force until the third act of the film but it does come on a tad heavier than I would have liked. It's not enough to ruin the film by any means but it does feel a little tacked-on.<br/><br/>As far as cinematography and imagery, I am never one to grade too harsh on a comedy. 21 Jump Street has a very formulaic comedy feel to it. The main focus in a comedy is the dialogue and performances and that is the same with this film. The one stylistic choice the film makes is by inserting graphic slates for the behavioral stages caused by the drug ""H.F.S."" This is introduced at the beginning of the film during a YouTube video of a student chronicling his drug high. They return to this trope multiple times in the film when the main characters get high. It is funny the first time, but loses its effectiveness in the latter stages of the film.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill continues his stellar work, Channing Tatum has broadened his raw repertoire, and the rookie live-action directing effort by Phil Lord and Chris Miller can be commended. 21 Jump Street isn't a particularly innovative comedy nor can it be considered one of the greatest ""buddy-cop"" films ever. Instead, it is a fun film with inspired performances by its leads that sets off the 2012 film season with a bang. I suggest going in with no expectations as that will allow you to reap the greatest reward.<br/><br/>Review Written by: Jordan Wade @ ultness.com"
"paudie","7","1","1","4 April 2012"," Very funny in parts but didn't sustain it
","21 Jump Street is funny in parts but doesn't keep a high quality of laughs throughout.<br/><br/>The story (based very loosely on the old TV series) is about two young cops who went to the same school but only became friends when they are in the police academy. Due to their youthful looks and poor policing skills they are assigned to an undercover operation trying to stop the supply of a new drug in a high school.<br/><br/>Due to a mix up in their cover names the cop who was nerdy at school ends up hanging out with the ""cool kids"" and vice versa. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are well cast as the odd couple of cops who thereby end up learning a lot about friendship by the time the movie ends. They are also Executive Producers by the way.<br/><br/>The movie is unashamedly crude in the spirit of American Pie and Superbad and that is not a criticism even if I found the bad language a bit tiresome by the end. <br/><br/>There are a constant stream of jokes and funny situations through the movie but overall I thought that not enough of them were funny enough to justify giving it a high rating. There have been so many US high school comedies that a movie really has to be something special to stand out from the crowd."

","I saw the advanced screening for this yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. The movie positively revels in the various stereotypes that other movies in the genre take far too seriously. The self deprecating humor was truly excellent, and I couldn't believe it but I was laughing during the pretty much the whole movie. 21 Jump St. definitely has a lot of the same elements that made Superbad a joy, and some of the supporting cast - Chris Parnell, Rob Riggle - were absolutely awesome. I give this movie a 9, and expect it to end up in the 7.5 range after it opens. Lots of swearing and a good gross-out scene. Best comedy I've seen in a while."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","3","6","22 March 2012"," Definitely a great comedy.
","This never had been a movie people were expecting lots of great things off. However the closer it came to its release date the bigger the buzz about it got, that it actually was going to be a pretty great and hilarious movie. And it is a surprisingly good movie but it also definitely is not without its flaws and weaknesses as well.<br/><br/>I was honestly really loving the movie for its first 30 minutes or so. The comedy was great and the movie genuinely made me laugh. What I loved about it was that it was being build up and treated almost like a serious movie, even while the events and characters themselves were being pretty silly. It's not the same sort of lame and childish comedy you are accustomed to seeing, in modern day comedies. It's refreshing that the movie is taking its own approach to its comedy and is also doing some unexpected and original stuff with it at times.<br/><br/>The story and its concept were also definitely likable aspects about this movie. Having two cops going undercover at an high school of course gives the writers plenty of room and opportunity to come up with lots of comical situations. But what is good about it is that its script is cleverly avoiding all of the clichés and the story still mostly works out as a surprise, though the story of course never really becomes the most important aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>It's also all really about its two main characters and their dynamics. Even all of the Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum haters will be able to laugh and like them, in this particular movie. They handle all of the comedy well and suit their roles. It's funny how Channing Tatum seems to have far more range and charisma in a comedy, as opposed to in a more serious role. I would definitely urge him to do more comedies in the near future, since he seems to be really comfortable- and has a true talent for the genre. I also feel I should mention Ice Cube, who was greatly hilarious, in a small role.<br/><br/>But it's not like the whole movie is just a great and hilarious one to watch. Its middle part was not bad but it was definitely lacking. The first part of the movie had so much pace to it but the movie slows down a bit too much in the middle, which also makes the movie feel a bit overlong. Really, the movie would had been a better one if it was 15 minutes shorter or if it had maintained its good and quick pace, throughout the entire movie its duration.<br/><br/>It's still a great comedy, that will make you laugh and I can certainly guarantee you that. It just has some weaker and slower moments in it as well, which just prevents me from calling this movie an absolute must-see.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"bdgill12","7","3","6","18 March 2012"," Hilarious and Jam-Packed with Shenanigans
","To say that I am surprised, dear readers, by my full-on, unabashed enthusiasm for 21 Jump Street would be the understatement of the year. When the project was announced, I thought it sounded terrible and the first time I saw the trailer, I thought the same thing. That trailer, though, grew on me with each and every viewing and by the time I got to the theater this weekend, I was primed for a darn good time, and that's exactly what the movie delivers.<br/><br/>Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are unlikely pals. In high school, Schmidt was a loser whom Jenko routinely humiliated. But when they both join the police force, they develop a mutually beneficial friendship and eventually become partners on the beat. After a poorly executed drug bust, they are transferred under the command of Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), who runs an undercover unit out of a church on 21 Jump Street. The pair is sent in to a local high school and tasked with infiltrating and bringing down a drug ring that threatens to spread its new product to the surrounding city. But with their roles reversed and the abilities put to the test, can these two misfits get the job done before the entire operation is shut down?<br/><br/>One of the things that gave me pause concerning 21 Jump Street is the headliners. I appreciate Hill's talent both as a comedian and an actual actor (as displayed in Moneyball) but his isn't a name that gets me excited. For every Get Him to the Greek (which I love), there's a film like The Sitter (which appeared to be horrendous). I have no such conflict over Tatum's involvement with this project. Aside from his acceptable work in She's the Man (a film I have an odd affection for), I've never seen a movie involving Tatum that I did not leave with a little vomit in my mouth and a little hate in my heart. I've long thought that he might be the worst actor in Hollywood. Surprisingly, not only do Hill and Tatum turn out to be a perfect match for this sort of raucous action-comedy, Tatum is actually the best part. He plays the dumb jock well, a role he is well suited for, but he also displays an excellent comedic timing I wouldn't have thought he had. I'm not saying this will completely change my opinion of the man but it certainly won't hurt. Hill, meanwhile, brings an element of authenticity to his role; he's a nerd at heart who jumps on the chance to finally become cool. It's an antiquated trick that Jump Street pulls but Hill makes it work. Together these two show great chemistry and they work off of each other quite well, giving the feeling of a natural partnership that doesn't always come off with this sort of mismatched pairing. <br/><br/>The first act of 21 Jump Street is one of the funniest openers in recent memory. It is an absolute laugh riot, jam-packed with the juvenile-but- well-thought-out humor that is expected from an R-rated comedy in a post-Hangover world. No time is wasted on the set-up as the set of circumstances Schmidt and Jenko find themselves in are established within the first ten minutes and the film's plot is set into motion. I felt the second act, which brings into play the inevitable conflicts between the two buddies, wanes a bit and becomes slightly bogged down, though the fun never stops entirely. Perhaps the worst I could say about this middle portion is that it stretches on a few minutes too long. But before long, the pace again quickens and Schmidt and Jenko get back to the shenanigans that make the first act such a blast.<br/><br/>What directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) have crafted with Jump Street is an homage to the buddy cop movie with a hint of delicious self-awareness that seems appropriate given its '80s roots. They also surround their leads with an outstanding surrounding cast, including the aforementioned Ice Cube (perfect casting), a slightly underused Dave Franco, and the always funny Rob Riggle. Most importantly, the actors are provided with a hilarious script filled with a non-stop stream of jokes that never allows the audience to catch on to the abject stupidity of the characters' actions.<br/><br/>Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

","That's my new designation for movies restricted to young minds under the age of 14. ""21 Jump Street"" is one of the most sophomoric, inept movies I have seen in a long while. The screenplay was almost incoherent and the script was loaded with as many obscenities and vulgarities as you can find in a 112 minute picture, presumably to substitute for actual dialogue and humor.<br/><br/>You know what? I never learn. I keep attending current movies after reading some reviews on our website, and more often than not I am bitterly disappointed. If culture and the arts are cyclical and a series of peaks and valleys, we are now in the deepest valley in history. The NY times Book Review section is thinner than ever, no one writes operas or any other kind of good music, modern architecture is an aesthetic wasteland and motion pictures are worse than ever.<br/><br/>And so, I think this old fuddy-duddy will stick to the Turner Classic Movie station and FMC from now on and wait for an artistic upswing."

","What is up with the directors of animated films directing live-action films? Not that I have something against it. Their films are even better than the works of live-action film directors, working for years in the business. Brad Bird showed us that the Mission Impossible hasn't lost its spark after the brilliant third installment and gave us one of the best films in the Mission Impossible franchise. Now the directors of an animated hit Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Phil Lord and Chris Miller made one the best comedies ever and surely the best comedy of 2012. I have never seen the original series this film is based on but that didn't stop me any less from fully appreciating this comedy. <br/><br/>The whole film stands on the genius script written by Michael Baccall (I'm sure that Jonah Hill did not just collaborate on the story that he worked on the script too) the co-writer of the marvelously amazing Scott Pilgrim vs The World. The film makes fun and pays tribute to all those clichés of buddy cop movies and a lot of action films. One of the funniest scenes making fun of action films is the wonderfully shot chase scene on the highway. The running gag with explosions is award worthy. The screenwriter really knows all the clichés and when to make fun of them or make a good use of them in the story.<br/><br/>Jonha Hill has grown into a wonderful comedian. He never was as funny as he is in this film. Chaning Tatum, whom I have only seen in G.I. Joe surprised me the most from all the actors. He is actually a great comedian. They both play such wonderful idiots. The chemistry between these two actors is so well translated to screen. It almost like from Lethal Weapon. Ice Cube as the police captain of the undercover division steals every scene he is in. He has some of the best lines in the film. Just wonderful. <br/><br/>In the end this is one of the best comedies of the past years and one of the best comedies of 2012."

After the movie cleverly lays out the initial framework, we enter the main plot of Tatum and Hill being sent to high school to infiltrate a drug ring. The plot seems to lull at parts, however has enough well timed, witty humour to prevent the movie from becoming stale.

","Greetings again from the darkness. The original 1987-91 TV series ""jump"" started Johnny Depp's mega-superstardom career, and yes, he is a generous enough to appear in a brief cameo in this updated film from co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. The script from co-writers Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill makes little effort to stay true to the source material and that works in the film's favor.<br/><br/>We first meet Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as polar opposites at the same high school. One of them is a pudgy, nerdy looking guy trying hard to throw down an Eminem look, while the other is the ultra-cool jock who is skating by academically. Guess which is which? Flash forward seven years and these two are still misfits ... this time at the police academy where one aces the physical fitness tests and bombs academically and the other is just the opposite. Guess which is which? So these two decide to become buddies and help each other live the dream as badass cops.<br/><br/>Cut to the next scene where they are patrolling a park on bicycles visualizing their first big bust. When things go wrong ... SURPRISE! ... they are assigned to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), an angry man who runs the Jump Street undercover unit out of a Korean church. Since neither Hill nor Tatum look anything like high schoolers, the absurdity is written into the script. They become the most mis-matched brothers since Schwarzenegger and Devito in Twins.<br/><br/>Their mission is to discover the dealers and source for a new drug making its way through a local high school. The drug has already killed one student and it takes these two ""brothers"" about 5 minutes to uncover the dealers. The supplier is a bit slower to come and the process involves numerous comedy skits involving Tatum as a science geek and Hill as Peter Pan.<br/><br/>The comedy skits involve nice work from Elle Kemper, Nick Offerman, Rob Riggle and Chris Parnell. The cool kids are played by Dave Franco (James' brother) and Brie Larson. Car chases, a keg party, science experiments and the prom all play a role, as do white tuxedos and one of the oddest shootouts ever filmed. What seems like 1200 rounds are fired in a hotel room before someone is actually hit.<br/><br/>In addition to Depp's pretty cool cameo, there's also an appearance from Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson Peete, both from the TV series. Of course the story is ridiculous and the film never really takes itself seriously, but I was actually somewhat impressed with Channing Tatum's ability to play deadpan to Jonah Hill's slapstick. The two worked pretty well together and there are enough laughs to make this one worth seeing."
"bassrourke","7","5","15","6 March 2012"," Yes its good and full of funny!
","No way am I saying who turns up in cameos during this surprisingly very funny and cool reworking of the famed 80's television show. Channing Tatum is on a roll after 'The Vow' while 'Jonah Hill' is on another type of roll after his Oscar Nomination. Both are a fantastic duo of young looking policeman who go undercover to a high school to track down a supplier of a new synthetic drug frequently used by the students. The film has little decorum kicking into gear within minutes and not really slowing down. The little things in the boys comic routine is what works best, their one liners, banter with Ice Cube and the quips referring to high schoolers. Forget the script, this is just fun action fluff better than 'Project X' and 'This Means War' put together. Excellent soundtrack too and Brie Larson backs up her coolness she displayed in the best unknown movie ever; JUST PECK. The original TV theme gets a run during the final credits."

","Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are a pair of underachieving cops who find themselves being sent back to a local high school by Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) to try to infiltrate a team of drug dealer students who are selling a dangerous drug called 'HFS' to their fellow students. As part of their cover, they pose as brothers Doug and Brad Quaid. They not only have to infiltrate the dealers, but they also need to find out who the person is that is responsible for supplying the drug. This proves more difficult than Schmidt and Jenko imagined as they try to balance the need to re-live their youths with the undercover investigation that they've been assigned to by Captain Dickson.<br/><br/>I must admit that when I saw the Top Billed Cast as Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Ice Cube it didn't exactly fill me with confidence. However, these 3 actors worked really well together and I found that I was pleasantly surprised by how good the performances were between the 3 leads. Tatum isn't the greatest actor in the world, but he was good here and actually proved to be quite funny. Hill is a better actor and he did give a better performance than Tatum, but whenever they were on screen together they were a joy to watch. The biggest surprise for me was Ice Cube's performance as Captain Dickson. If we're honest, yes perhaps it was over the top, but I just found his character to be the funniest character in this film and he also arguably had some of the best lines in this film. He really did steal every scene he was in (although it's difficult to ignore the shameless product placement of 'Straight Outta Compton' playing in the background whilst Dickson is talking - this song was by NWA which were a group of which Ice Cube was a member).<br/><br/>What makes this work is that although Schmidt and Jenko both have major weaknesses, their strengths almost compensate for them. Jenko is a jock who is physically strong, fast and athletic, but unfortunately he has an IQ in single figures. Whereas Schmidt is the academic geeky one who gets full marks in his assessments, but is totally useless at the practical side of policing (i.e arresting suspects). I liked the idea of Jenko (the jock) being the one that struggles to gain acceptance when they are enrolled back at school during their undercover operation whereas Schmidt (the geek) is the one that proves to be popular. This goes against the norm and was the opposite to what happened when they were actually at school together. The film really starts to get funny when Schmidt and Jenko end up enrolled on the wrong courses when, as part of their cover they can't remember who was Brad and who was Doug which subsequently forces Jenko to enrol in Chemistry classes and Schmidt to enrol in drama and athletics. However, this proves to be a good move for Jenko and Schmidt as they are both given the opportunity to strengthen their weak areas - Jenko is still the braun, but also gains some 'smarts' and Schmidt is still the brainy one, but he also toughens up. This obviously works to their advantage as the film progresses.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this also gives the opportunity for Jenko and Schmidt to re-live their youths (this proves to be more important to Schmidt as he had such a lousy time at school). This aspect of the film was another strong point as Jenko and Schmidt at times seemed to forget that they had a job to do and they both just seem to want to get 'down with the kids'.<br/><br/>If I was to be critical of this film I would say that the humour is pretty 'low brow' and for the most part isn't exactly 'intelligent' humour, but I can forgive the film because for the most part the 'low brow' humour was fairly funny. I also felt the finale was a little overblown and went on for a tad too long. There are 1 or 2 surprises towards the end (1 of which will definitely come as a surprise).<br/><br/>On the whole, this film was good and there was definitely enough humour to make it watchable. It's far from a brilliant film and a lot of the 'low brow' humour may bother some people. Personally, I found that it just about managed to avoid crossing the line between being funny and being vulgar. It's a long way off being the funniest film I've ever seen, but there are worse ways that you can spend 105 minutes."

","This movie was not only racist, offensive and unfunny, it was just plain dull. Is someone not knowing that the word amen is the customary conclusion to a prayer funny?....maybe in the central valley, but everywhere else it's just plain sad, that's why this movie tanked. The 1990's fascination with angry blacks and women verbally denigrating navel gazing white males has come and gone. Homosexual innuendo in this film is an understatement, it's more like blatant promotion. I watched shows like 3's company growing up which parodied homophobia, but this is just foul and obvious...the same people who dogged movies like porky's and police academy for glorifying male machismo where obviously behind this dud. There where a few chuckles periodically in spite of the lame story line and bigoted script, but anyone who claims to have found this pig slop funny obviously has an agenda. and shame on anyone who allows their children to watch this nonsense, and most importantly shame on Johnny depp for appearing in this.

","Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are the stereotypical nerd and jock in high school who are on the opposite sides of the social spectrum. Seven years later, they both bump into each other while joining for the police force and they team up to utilize each other's positive aspects and improve themselves. They both connect and become genuine friends in due course. When a drug bust goes south, they are sent back to the local high school to blend in as students and bust a synthetic drug ring.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not a big fan of either of the leads, but do enjoy some of their better fare. This, as it turns out, is one of their better movies. If you can picture Tatum as a high school kid, then right off the bat it starts out funny. The chemistry between Schmidt and Jenko is infectious and instant. The actors make us connect to these characters. In that regard, Jonah and Channing were fantastic. The script deserves credits for dextrously balancing outrageous humor with great character development. The movie is subtly self-aware and relevant to today's social scenario. The explanation for why a 20-year-old police idea was being rehashed, a loopy drug trip sequence which included ice-cream heads, the explosions or the lack of them and sequences like that are insanely hilarious. The movie also deserves credit for not only not hooking up Schmidt with a superhot girl, but actually managing to believably create a bond between him and a normal (but beautiful) girl.<br/><br/>I knew 21 Jump Street was the TV show that kick-started Johnny Depp's career, but haven't seen the show that the movie is based on. Even though the original was a serious drama and the new version veers into comedy territory, this is one of the best reboots I've seen. Johnny Depp's cameo came out of the blue and that was unbelievable. It was jaw-droppingly awesome. Overall, the movie is so much better than I thought it would be and is absolutely one of the best buddy comedies in a long time. The movie has real stakes, is fun, smart, honest, grounded and has a lot of heart along with its crude, comedic wizardry.<br/><br/>8/10"
"p-stepien","4","2","4","29 December 2012"," Somewhat of a spoof
","Somewhat of a half-hearted fan of the original TV series, ""21 Jump Street"" was a mildly entertaining pop-cultural entry to the 2012 film season. Changing in both character and tone the feature is a comedic outtake from the series, borrowing the basic ideas, but essentially formed around a goofy buddy cop flick. When two cop rejects Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) make a mess of an arrest by forgetting the wording of the Miranda rights. As a last chance the duo are reassigned to a revived speciality division on 21 Jump Street, which sends undercover units to infiltrate high schools. When the first mission sends both back to their high school, they aim to seamlessly integrate by recapturing their former school standings: Jenko as the popular jock type and Schmidt as the school geek. A screw-up in school papers has their roles reversed...<br/><br/>Mostly a spoof with little sensibility ""21 Jump Street"" is rarely fun, mostly feeling like a semi-redundant Van Wilder rethink. Nothing of the original franchise is truly kept, apart from a brief and ultimately unfunny cameo by DEA Agents Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise). Due to this any attempt to compare it to its series namesake is pretty pointless, instead leaving the necessity to vote on the movie on its own merits. As such the plot feels extremely lacking invention with slap-sticky mistaken identity comedy supplanting procedural drama. Mildly funny, mostly juvenile, as a comedy the concept fails to redeem itself in the slightest, thus making it a forgettable viewing comparable to a multitude of teenage-aimed comedies littering the market. Albeit the attempt at self-mockery wasn't necessarily a bad idea, the overall effort was not inventive enough, and although several jokes do catch you unalert with their subversiveness, it fails to reach any heights of note.<br/><br/>For me the main issue has to do with the main gripe with many modern comedy movies. They seem to gimmicky and ultimately contrived to bring about real laughs, as if trying to hard to hit home with a laugh (jokes almost punctuated as if to highlight where you are supposed to laugh). People like Seth Rogen or Diablo Cody manage to somehow avoid these pitfalls, but writer-actor Jonah Hill hits them head on."

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","8","2","4","11 June 2012"," 21 Jump Street (2012)
","A genuine surprise in quality and enjoyment. This is an example of a film where all the elements came together. 21 Jump Street is based on an 80's TV show, mostly famous for launching Johnny Depp's career. The idea sounds pretty ridiculous, wherein a group of young looking police officers go undercover as high school students. The film does well to turn this into a complete comedy. Tatum and Hill are old high school buddies that hated each other, as Tatum had fun bullying Hill. After school they both join the Police Academy, where they discover they can help each other out. Hill tutors Tatum, and Tatum trains Hill for physical stuff. A real loving friendship develops, but after an arrest goes wrong, they are shipped off to 21 Jump Street and asked to go undercover to discover the supplier of a new drug. The film hits just about every element of comedy it can. It plays on stereotypes, as Tatum and Hill are surprised to find students that care for the environment and are tolerant of each other. It also self parodies. The police chief mentions how they are regurgitating an assignment from the 80's, clearly nodding towards the film being a remake. Slapstick, clever dialogue, it all works. Tatum is perfectly cast, and like Wahlberg before him, seems to have a real gift for comedy. He excels by playing his usual jock self in full earnestness. Hill has obviously learnt from his acting chops being stretched on Moneyball. He i similar to previous characters, but knows when to dial it down. Their relationship carries the film, and we can easily understand their states of mind as Hill sees what it's like to be the popular kid. There are a numerous amount of stand out hilarious skits. One seeing Tatum and Hill getting high, and going through the five stages. It works better as a high school fish out of water comedy than it does an action movie, but even these scenes have their highlights.Funny supporting roles, exceptional cameos, and pacing that knows how to advance the plot, excite, build on characters, and make you laugh out loud, all at the same time. Perhaps one of the greats this year."

","First of all, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I laughed a lot, although I thought the funniest clip of the movie was Nick Offerman's character describing the 21 Jump Street Program, which happens near the beginning.<br/><br/>You could tell that the type of jokes and the scenarios they were put in were trying to mimic the successes of movies like The Hangover and Superbad. That's not a bad thing since those movies were wildly successful and funny, but they tend to get a little old after a while.<br/><br/>What this movie lacked was the content that The Hangover or Superbad had, and that's partly due to the fact that it's a remake, so the story isn't new. It also parallels a lot of partner cop movies. Partners don't get along, then partners get along and everything is great for a while, then something goes wrong, then they come out on top.<br/><br/>Obviously, we expect to see Jonah Hill in a comedy, but not necessarily Channing Tatum. I thought they made a pretty good duo, despite the fact that the roles that they played were pretty typical of what you would expect from each.<br/><br/>Again, I enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it, but would not put it in the same echelon of comedy movies like The Hangover and Superbad."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","4","26 March 2012"," An off-the-wall-funny genre sendup that works
","What was the point of making a ""21 Jump Street"" movie? No, really, why bother remaking or rebooting re-imagining a short-lived cop series from the '80s, especially when you've targeted your movie at people born long after it went off the air?<br/><br/>The way writer Michael Bacall along with Jonah Hill, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller and anyone else with a creative hand in this movie answer this question earns ""21 Jump Street"" its badge of honor—or dishonor, depending how you look at it.<br/><br/>""21 Jump Street"" is as monumental of a sendup as has ever been committed to film. It's mere existence serves us a refreshing dose of Hollywood self-ridicule uncommon in today's movies. Oh, and it's really funny.<br/><br/>The film reveals its intentions early when Nick Offerman's Dep. Chief Hardy assigns our heroes Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) to 21 Jump Street where they'll be debriefed on going undercover as high schoolers, but not before rambling about how the higher-ups like to waste everyone's time reviving dead programs from the '80s. Sounds like Hollywood in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Everything from chase scenes to the buddy-cop dynamic to explosions faces the satirical scrutiny of the filmmakers and Lord and Miller play it up to the point at which it can neither be taken too seriously or blown off as immature twaddle.<br/><br/>Hill and Tatum make a good duo, but Tatum's presence in the film makes it fresh. Unless you subjected yourself to ""The Dilemma,"" you've never witnessed his comic prowess. His combination of bravado, idiocy and deep-seated social insecurity as Jenko make him a real hit. Hill also works the full range of smart and awkward to totally outrageous.<br/><br/>The script uses the brilliant device of having these two accidentally assume the high-school identity intended for the other, so Tatum has to hang out with the dorks while Hill must get in with the cool kids. A spot-on satire of how high-school kids have completely changed in just a matter of five or six years emerges here. Of our two high-school drug dealers, one cares a lot about green initiatives and the other is gay, which is not exactly in line with high-school stereotypes. At one point, Tatum profanely blames ""Glee"" for screwing up the once-Darwinian nature of the high school social hierarchy.<br/><br/>As for jokes, ""21 Jump Street"" piles on crude humor, though usually with more effectiveness than most run-of-the-mill R-rated offerings. Seeing as Schmidt and Jenko must track down the supplier of a new synthetic drug, the movie offers more than a couple instances of drug- trip sequences, namely one in which Eric (Dave Franco, James' little brother) makes the two try the drug so he ""knows they're cool."" Given that the script explicitly states that the drug works in four main stages — one of which is ""tripping major ballsack"" — it builds up the humor more effectively.<br/><br/>Immaturity abounds in the film, but with a wink and a smile. Except for maybe an older, slightly more ignorant audience, few people will watch this start to finish and not realize the filmmakers are aware of the dumb and silly moments in the movie. You can even see through the awkward quasi-romance between Schmidt and Brie Larson's character, Molly, because no one would find romantic catharsis in a budding relationship between a 25-year-old and high school senior.<br/><br/>Like most modern comedies, ""21 Jump Street"" has a number of misses in spite of its many successful laughs, but the majority of them work, especially because in painting this typical picture of high school, it adds a few fine details of what high school is really like these days.<br/><br/>Best, however, for those familiar with the TV show to divorce themselves from anything related to it, as the movie merely leeches off the name and premise, then tosses everything off to the side minus a few obvious in-jokes. It's typical Hollywood, but the self-awareness of this phenomenally goofy comedy sets it apart from its peers.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Check out more at moviemusereviews.com"

","Funny movie overall. Realism is thrown out the door early on, and honestly it's a comedy, so who expects much realism.

My favorite part of this movie is the meta, self-referential jokes throughout, such as not saying the title of the movie at the most cliché moment to do so, and references to unoriginality in ideas, and non-exploding/exploding items, etc. Channing Tatum is also surprisingly good in this movie, plays his character well and humorously alongside Jonah Hill (who I love, though I understand why many may dislike him).

This is shown in a comedic view to keep the viewers attention and to stand out from the typical undercover police drama.<br/><br/>The film is funny from the getgo and although it has a lot of bad language, the language allows the characters to be portrayed more realistically then they would if they didn't swear, like come on, what high schooler doesn't swear?<br/><br/>Overall although the film is set to be comedic about a serious issue it turned out to be a good film with a great story line and great character development. However this does not mean it deserves 10*, there were quite a few errors in rendering. For example when Eric gives Channning and Jonah's characters the guns, he can be heard speaking but his mouth doesn't move.<br/><br/>Further more the story line is quite basic and typical of the high school story line where one character is bullied while one isn't, and for this reason i have chosen to give 7 stars, alongside the fact that the story line is predictable in some places."

","""21 Jump Street"" Is based on a TV show in the late 80's that starred Johnny Deep. It was a police procedural that focuses on a squad of youthful-looking police officers that went undercover, and investaged crimes in the local high school, colleges and their headquarters was a church. Now, the new movie is pretty much the same thing as the TV show; however, it pairs two Hollywood actors that ramp up the energy, and the result is the movie is funny. Its very funny and I was howling throughout. Been a while since I laughed that hard at a comedy.<br/><br/>It begins with, Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill), a chubby high school nerd who has braces and is addicted to Eminem. Greg Jenko, (Channing Tatum) is a wise-cracking & underachieving jock. After both are rejected from their high school prom, the two meet seven years later at the city police academy and become close friends. While expecting to have wild police careers, a stupid stunt lands them in hot water, and they are re-assigned to a special undercover division where they must go back to their old high school to find the dealer of a new synthetic drug and put him behind bars.<br/><br/>How many times do we have to see the same situation where the jocks tortures the nerd? Now I'm one for gags as long as no one gets hurt. In this case, these two characters are funny enough to make you laugh that as soon as I saw Jonah Hill dressed like Eminem, I busted my guts laughing. Enter Greg Jenko who snickers with his buddies when Morton gets tongue-tied trying to ask a girl to the prom. At this point, we know they are going to be misfits.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are the perfect buddy cops that are written so well, they will have you howling with laughter every few seconds with non-stop jokes and humour. Since Tatum is usually not in this type of film, he actually is incredibly funny and proves he is a talented actor. Hill is equally, and their on-screen chemistry is a top notch that without these two actors, this film would not be what it is.<br/><br/>For those that think crude humour jokes are hilarious, Ice Cube plays Captain Dickson, his name would have to have the word ""dick"" in it, a foul mothered police veteran who can't believe how incompetent these two dummies are. At one point they attempt to arrest a fat bald biker in a park. They manage to capture his buddy, and instead of Mirandizing him, Jenko humps him while Morton shoots a gun in the air because he is their first capture. Not before a slur of dick jokes that will make the easiest of people to laugh. What's even funnier is the wailing screams of mercy the biker lets out when Jenko is humping him for comic effect.<br/><br/>In the second act, Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko go from class to class trying to find the dealer of the drug only to be caught up in wild high school parties and schemes that result in laughs, but a lot of the gags have to do with their partnership, almost like a married couple. There is a sequence where the two take the drug to pass the ""I'm not a cop"" test and attempt to vomit the drug later. What results is an acid trip like never before. You will have a good time with ""21 Jump Street,"" despite the vulgarity but what do you expect from the guy who was in ""Knocked Up"" with Seth Rogan?"

They are given student profiles fitted to their individual skills; unfortunately they prepare so poorly that they don't bother learning their undercover names and end up having to try to be plausible playing the other's role.<br/><br/>This film was much better than I expected; there were lots of genuinely hilarious moments as well as some surprisingly good action. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry as Schmidt and Jenko; they provided plenty of laughs throughout; they may have looked a bit old for high school students but that wasn't really a problem, after most high school films cast people who are much older than their characters at least here the characters are actually meant to be older. The rest of the cast is pretty solid too; notably Ice Cube, as the gruff Captain Dickson; Brie Larson who plays Molly, a girl Schmidt gets involved with and Rob Riggle, as PE teacher Mr. Walters. The comedy won't be to everybody's taste but I thought it was hilarious for the most part; it certainly didn't go quite as far into gross out territory as many recent comedies the one possible exception to this is a scene where a bad guy becomes 'less of a man' after being shot in the groin then tries to pick up what he lost with his teeth! Hilarious? Disturbing? Disgusting? You decide! Overall I'd certainly recommend this to viewers wanting a good laugh with some decent action."
"mistoppi","8","0","0","3 May 2016"," So much better than I expected
","To be fair I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. 21 Jump Street is hilarious. Of course many of the jokes are typical and disgusting and annoying, but a lot of times the jokes and the absurdity of the situation just becomes absolutely hilarious. A good example is when they have to take the drug in front of the guy selling them, and then the rest of their day goes so wrong in ridiculous way. <br/><br/>Probably the best joke is when Deputy Chief Hardy says ""We're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle stuff from the past and expect us all not to notice."" Great irony!<br/><br/>I haven't actually seen the original show, but from what I know there's no point in comparing them like which one is better, since the stories are different and all that. But 21 Jump Street is absolutely hilarious, and just so much better than what I expected."
"ufster-2","8","0","0","28 April 2016"," Has that 80's coming of age movies' charm
","What drives the movie primarily is the screen chemistry between its two lead actors but that's not to say it lacks depth otherwise. It works well as a coming of age movie where our arrested development case protagonists go back to high school, one with hopes of reliving, the other with goals of avoiding their respective experiences a few years back. There is a resurgence of coming of age movies in recent years, perhaps people like to reminisce through others what it meant once to have their whole life ahead of them, without the accumulated cynicism of old age to weigh them down, perhaps they would like to forget momentarily that their best years are behind them. Certainly, 21 Jump Street also has this naive quality, could be willful ignorance to some extent, but as rare as it is, it's nice to pretend a world like that exists where even the bad guys aren't so bad as they shoot and murder undercover police officers in cold blood.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street captures the essence of that youthful innocence, that high-school camaraderie between best friends and sprinkles some dust of platonic romance on top of it for good measure. The end result is a surprisingly witty, endearing and funny movie which creates a good balance between being self-aware yet sticking to the conventions where it matters. It's a really good watch as a result."

"Quinoa1984","8","0","0","30 November 2015"," one of the pleasant surprises of 2012 for a few reasons
","A property like 21 Jump Street was something I didn't have many expectations for: I didn't watch the show (despite young Johnny Depp as the star), and the prospect of another buddy-cop comedy is not something that is an instant hit. You need fresh ideas and a good sense of humor about what you're working with. And yet there were a number of people who came in and made it a real surprise. Watching just the trailer you get a sense of the comic timing and approach of total who gives a s*** irreverence from Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (and Ice Cube as well as the guy heading up their plot), and that this is fully self-aware. Part of this comes from the actors, but it also comes from the directors Lord and Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was where they showed everyone they could do it, while The LEGO movie two years later cemented their reputations as the new great comedy directing team).<br/><br/>A lot of the jokes and lines and throw-away moments that just carry a lot of solid laughs come from the filmmakers trusting their actors to pull off some dumb jokes in smart ways, and visa-versa. I include Channing Tatum in this, and he surprised me the most in that before this movie I didn't think he was much of an actor (mostly from his dramas, where he just seemed weak or trying too hard). But in one year, between this movie and Magic Mike, he showed that he has real charm and screen presence, and knows how to find the way to play things both straight and funny when a dialog exchange is required. Of course here he's the more tough presence set against Jonah Hill, and yet there's plenty of jokes put at his expense that he plays like a... pro! <br/><br/>There's some set pieces that revel in the action, and it comes close to running out of steam in the last third (until it reveals a couple of big cameos that shouldn't be big surprises, but they're still actors that suddenly give a shot of adrenaline to the comedy and action in the climax). For long stretches though 21 Jump Street leaps so high above what this could have been as a generic remake of a popular TV show; it's like actual clever ideas and gags on display, and a lot of it comes down to behavior as well, whether it's the main two actors or with Ice Cube, or Brie Larson as one of the supporting women set at the high school, (or Dave Franco of course), and there's plenty of times where it comes down to the actors saying one thing or another and finding just the right moment to make something funny.<br/><br/>Not every single joke clicks, but so many do that 21 Jump Street makes the cop (undercover) comedy conceit fresh and fun. You see these guys just having pure fun with finding how to dig into what makes these clichés tic, and not simply with buddy/cop movies but just how buddies relate in a movie. It's got heart underneath when it takes a breath between things like stabbing Hill in the back at a party (no, don't worry, it's in the trailer, and it's as awesome as it seems)."

","Before this movie, I wasn't a fan of Jonah Hill, and especially not Channing Tatum. When I heard this movie was being released, I thought they got Tatum, to attract the female crowd, and Hill to attract the average guy. After watching this, I found this was not the case. This was the first time in a while where this new age comedy struck me as humorous. The thing that appealed to me most, was how it ""made fun of"" My generation. ""the teen crowed"". Going back to school, seeing the stereotypical new age kids, was funny for me. The acting on both parts were above average, and both actors complimented each others role. I don't want to say this was an original storyline, but I couldn't tell that it was a branch off of another film like an Adam sandler movie is nowadays. I do believe there will be a sequel, as a little cliff hanger, (as seen in many comedies) is put at the end. I would say that I would gladly go and spend money to see it."

","I never saw the original TV series that this was based on, so I don't know how well of an adabtation it is. I've also never seen Channing Tatum in anything, and very little of Jonah Hill. I really wouldn't have bothered with this movie if everyone wasn't saying how great it was and quoting it all the time. So how did the movie turn out? Pretty good actually. I was a little afraid when I started it, but in the end I found myself having a good time.<br/><br/>Cons, there are a few dry spots, and there really aren't any big laughs. There are plenty of moments where I was laughing, but never one where I could barely breath and my sides hurt, which is what a lot of people made it sound like. Also there is one really big plot hole, or lack of logic. This may be a spoiler, but I'm not sure.When they get there, the mess up there names, so they get each others schedules. Tatum was supposed to be in drama and band, Hill was in AP Chem. The only person who knows is the princibal, and he probably won't remember. Just go to the classes you were supposed to go to. They don't know who you are.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie is pretty funny, but I really liked the action scenes and the plot. The action was exiting, and better shot them action scenes in some actual straight up action movies. And the plot has many twists and turns. I was actually surprised by who the suplier turned out to be, and there is a really cool cameo near the ending. The acting and chemistry between Tatum and Hill is good, and it's not really ever boring.<br/><br/>This isn't ""a gut-wretching, you won't be able to breath because your laughing too hard movie"", but it is fun, and has some great moments in it."
"KineticSeoul","8","0","0","3 July 2012"," Way better than the trailer...Which is actually pretty rare.
","This is one of those few movies where the movie is better than the trailer. And the trailer ain't even misleading. Cause when I saw the trailer to this movie I had low expectations for it, but it turned out to actually be a funny comedy. I thought the comedy would be something similar to ""The Other Guys"" which is a movie I really disliked. But I was relieved to find out that the two protagonist are idiot characters but they don't try to act so darn forced to act like idiots to be funny. This movie embraces stereotype in a funny manner sometimes, now the key word here is funny. Without it trying to be overly offensive or malicious while using these stereotypes. The partnership between the two protagonist is a dorky smart guy and a brainless jock that is actually likable. Anyways they didn't really get along or anything like that although the attended the same high school at the same time. But they both end up training at the same police academy and end up being best for buds. And after they both become cops they go undercover back to high school to find the suppliers for a drug that kills teens. But it's engaging and it's just never gets boring or start to run out of steam. Yeah some parts are just too stereotypical, but they don't go super overboard to the point the whole thing is ridiculous. Even the girl that the smart dork falls for isn't the hottest girl in school or anything like that. Cause the hot cheerleader falling for the kid with the heart of gold scenario has been done to death and not all that believable. But in this the guy actually might have a chance. Anyways when it comes to the undercover part which takes up most of the movie I found it intriguing how the popular jock back in the day end up chilling with the nerds and the smart dork hangs with the popular kids. So they both handle areas they never been before. And it's funny how things play-out. But what stood out a lot is how realistic and relatable it is when it comes to the teens in high school and what they do during free-time. This movie is just fun all the way through.

","21 Jump Street is a theatrical release based on the 80s TV show with the same name even though the film has almost nothing to do with the show. However, that doesn't stop the film from being a great popcorn flick of 2012. First of all, Channing Tatum gives by far his best performance as Jenko, one of the two main characters. Also, Jonah Hill gives one of his best performances as Jenko's partner, Schmidt. Also, Rob Riggle, Ice Cube, and Brie Larson give good performances also. Hill and Tatum share great chemistry and you buy and feel their friendship through the entirety of the film. This is also one of the funniest films that may have ever seen. The movie plays crude humor and plays it well. Most films that try this either over due it or under do it, but not 21 Jump Street. Also, the action is very good. Overall, this is a great comedy, a great buddy cop movie, and a great parody (of Buddy Cop films) all in one. This is by far the funniest film of 2012. I give it an 8.2/10"
"rebecca-ry","8","0","0","5 April 2012"," Best comedy in a while
","'21 Jump Street' is one of the funniest films released for at least two years. I didn't expect it to be so funny but it really surprised me. <br/><br/>The acting is really well done, Channing Tatum really surprised me, with a track record that includes 'Dear John' and 'The Vow' you wouldn't expect him to do so well. He should do a lot more comedy because he has changed my perception of him as an actor in this film. Both him and Jonah Hill work really well together and both perform great. Other actors in the film like Dave Franco and even Johnny Depp in his entire five minutes add a lot of comedy to the film. <br/><br/>The script is well-written. Some anti-cliché's like the title drop where the man mixes up the street name really do make everyone laugh simply because it isn't expected. The style of this film reminded me of 'Pineapple Express' (the last decent buddy-comedy I can think of) so if you enjoyed that film you will probably enjoy this. The believable initial plot which slowly becomes more and more hilarious and ridiculous is very like 'Pineapple Express' but both films should be considered different as '21 Jump Street' certainly doesn't copy it. It can be a bit predictable at some points but there are some scenes where you really don't know what's coming. <br/><br/>The film really does make everyone laugh at some points, Jonah Hill has written this script very well indeed. Overall, I would recommend this film if you really like comedies and have noticed the lack of decent comedy in cinema lately. It can be quite vulgar at some points, particularly at the end, but the entire film makes you laugh.It would be difficult for someone to not laugh at all whilst watching this film."

","So I just came back from watching ""21 Jump Street"" and was seriously impressed with not only how funny It was, (For the most part) but also how smart it was, in terms of understanding what young people are like today and how they put a spin on certain scenarios.<br/><br/>I'm assuming you already know the story as this review will most likely not be the first you read, so I will just skip to what I thought. Let me get one thing clear, skinny Jonah Hill is just as funny as fat Jonah Hill. Weight is not relevant to comedy unless it relies mostly on slapstick humour, which this film only has touches of. There were so many moments to pick from where I laughed, but by far the funniest scene Is Channing Tatum and Hill on drugs.<br/><br/>I was Impressed with how surprisingly good everyone acted in this, as generally a film packed with comedy has less focus on good acting. Obviously it's far from Oscar worthy, but I felt myself getting really involved In the film, unlike a comedy such as step brothers, which I saw more as a scenario for making joke after joke. <br/><br/>There are only a couple of minor things I have to say about this. The first being that the comedy falls a bit flatter during the final act. Don't get me wrong, I still laughed in places, but the pumping out of good jokes was much more consistent in the first half of the film. Nevertheless, still a hilarious film. The second thing was a few predictable clichés that I saw coming, but I can let that slide because most films these days have them.<br/><br/>Overall the best comedy I've seen so far this year.

","If ever there was a sequel to Superbad in which the characters grow up to be cops, this might be what it looks like.

Jonah Jill and Channing Tatum are an incredible comedic duo as two rookie policeman, and the joy of their first ""successful"" arrest spills over onto the audience, and it swirls around with a manic energy for the rest of the film. 21 Jump Street is based on the classic television series starring Johnny Depp about cops going undercover at high school. Here, Tatum and Hill are looking to crack a drug ring! This film isn't merely an adaptation however, it takes humble shots at itself and is delightfully self-aware. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs fame, bring with them that same sense of visual overload and smart CGI into a few scenes that are so hilarious my abs still hurt.

"garethvk","7","3","9","16 March 2012"," Plenty of Bounce Left in Jump Street
","Back in 1987, the fledgling Fox Network debuted, offering entertainment on Saturday and Sunday evenings aimed at a younger audience. One of the network's first breakout shows was a police drama with young cops and plenty of action, a show named 21 Jump Street. The show featured a cast of largely unknowns who quickly bolted to overnight notoriety, most notably its star Johnny Depp who, much to his chagrin, became a pinup boy and sex symbol for the show.<br/><br/>The show mixed humor, action, and romance. It followed a team of young officers who were part of a special undercover unit that infiltrated high schools and colleges where they posed as students to solve various campus crimes. Johnny Depp left the show after the fourth season, wanting to be taken seriously as a legitimate actor. The show soon ended one year later. Despite having run only five seasons and having a short-lived spin off series for star Richard Grieco, ""21 Jump Street"" remained a pop-culture hit 25 years later.<br/><br/>As such, I had a lot of skepticism when I first heard that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum would be bringing an updated, raunchier version to the big screen that was heavy on laughs and would definitely aim for an R-rated. This theatrical version stars Hill as Officer Schmidt and Tatum as Officer Jenko, two young officers who met while in high school and, despite being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, bonded and became close friends during their time at the police academy years after graduation. When the duo find their lives as bike cops not as exciting as they had hoped and after they bungle their first chance at a significant arrest, the duo find themselves reassigned to the revived Jump Street project. <br/><br/>Schmidt, in spite of his misgivings, decides to face his fear of the horror that was high school decides to give it another chance. Jenko is soon horrified to see that the social structure that he dominated back in his day has clearly turned upside down. Jocks are no longer the big men on campus, replaced by sensitive New Age types. Nerds that he preyed upon are now the cool kids in school.<br/><br/>After the death of a student who took a new designer drug he bought at school, Schmidt and Jenko are assigned to find the dealers, infiltrate the gang and get to the bottom of the drug distribution ring and stop it at all costs. This proves to be easier said than done, especially for Schmidt. He begins to really relish his new found popularity in school and he starts to live the high school experience that he only dreamed about back in his day. Further complicating matters is Molly (Brie Larson), an attractive high school senior who quickly catches Schmidt's attention and becomes a focal point of his day-to-day activities.<br/><br/>Jenko, on the other hand, finds himself struggling as the former high school kingpin now finds himself a social outcast, spending much of his time with the chemistry nerds trying to find a way to work the social structure to get to the bottom of the school's drug trade.<br/><br/>Now what would be a simple assignment for two seasoned cops becomes completely unhinged for the to raw recruits who become more obsessed with social status than their mission and take extreme measures to ingratiate themselves with their new classmates. This all comes at a cost as their bond becomes strained due to Schmidt's rapidly ascending social status and their continued inability to crack the case.<br/><br/>Now this is a premise that has been done countless times in numerous cop films. ""21 Jump Street"" has a bold and fresh formula that deftly mixes elements of the gross-out teen comedy with an action-adventure film. While the film drags a bit in the middle, there are some incredibly funny jokes throughout the film. The action in the film is solid and fits well with the story rather than trying to spice things up with random explosions. <br/><br/>I loved how the film, based on a story co-written by Jonah Hill, and produced by both Hill and Tatum, took a fresh approach to the subject matter but also respectfully made fun of the source material, banking on nostalgia while updating it for a younger audience.<br/><br/>I can easily say this was probably Jonah Hill's best comedy to date as they were numerous laugh out loud moments in the film and he and Tatum make a fantastic duo, playing extremely well off one another. There are also several cameos in the film and strong supporting work from Ice Cube, who plays the extremely agitated captain of the inept cops placed under his command. The film sets up very well for a sequel and I understand that there's already preparation underway should this one do well at the box office.<br/><br/>""21 Jump Street"" is easily the funniest movie I've seen this year. I have not laughed this much, for all the right reasons, in quite a long time. Hip and fresh again, there's plenty of bounce left in ""21 Jump Street.""<br/><br/>3.5 stars out 5"

","Without spoiling the movie adaption of 21 Jump Street, as I am thankful no one ruined it for me, I am pleased with one revelation towards the end.<br/><br/>Combine that to the hilarious Nick Offerman (from the fantastic Parks & Recreation TV program) scene as our ""heroes"" are reprehended by Deputy Chief Hardy and you'll have the roughly 7 minutes of 109 that I liked.<br/><br/>OK, I don't want to be too harsh; it wasn't that bad. In fact, it felt slightly better the movie I felt it mostly mimicked, The Other Guys. That's not saying much, however.<br/><br/>It also didn't help that they, or again, Nick Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy, flat out tells you what to expect in the best line in the movie: ""We're reviving a canceled undercover project from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they've run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle sh|t from the past and hope that nobody will notice.""<br/><br/>I'm guessing that quote tells us not to take this seriously at all. Correct. But, they still needed a lot more consistency in their direction as this movie was all over the place while never knowing what kind of movie they wanted to be. Was it drama? Comedy? Slap-stick? A love story? A teen romp?<br/><br/>The only thing the movie and the original TV program it's based on have in common, with the exception of the title, is the little tiny bit of drama. Now, I was NOT a fan of the TV show back in the 80s, but since it was, in fact, the 1980s, we only had one TV and I watched this with my sister since she liked it. That said, I'd much rather watch a few seasons of that before I saw this again.<br/><br/>Dumb nerd, Schmidt (Johan Hill) and dumb jock, Jenko (Channing Tatum) do not combine their talents to make one cool guy, but instead show us repeatedly on how not to be a police officer. So much so, even they would've been kicked out of the original Police Academy in the original Police Academy.<br/><br/>They're forced to team up as undercover narcs to take down a drug ring at a high school. Along the way, they break every law in order to, uh, preserve the law. (This is the part they tell us to turn off our brains, like when they used to tell us to put on our 3-D glasses during the movie.)<br/><br/>Sadly, my message is not getting to the right exec in Hollywood: we need shorter run times for movies like these. This 109 minute movie absolutely needed to be between 85-90 minutes, but directors don't know when enough's enough. And hence, for the majority of the second half the movie wanders around from subplot to the next with obvious conclusions.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how this movie could've been better, aside from not being made in the first place or at least (again) better edited. Perhaps they could've stuck with the original theme and not follow the latest trend of remakes mocking the originals. I dunno, but in any case, I ain't moving down to Jump Street any time soon."
"LiveLoveLead","6","2","5","27 December 2012"," Hilarious, but the language and sexual stuff was way more than necessary...
","This movie had some crazy, fun, hilarious stuff. Several references to the original show and some cameos thrown in for good measure. My only gripe is... way too much profanity, and crude humor for my taste (a little goes a long way). You definitely don't want to take kids to this. They say ""motherf***er"" a ton. Lots of sexual innuendo. I think it would have been better if toned down a bit, but I know these ""raunchy"" movies are popular (Bridesmaid, the Hangover etc.) The ending when he shot off the bad guys ""private part"" and ""it"" was on the ground, and the guy was trying to pick ""it"" up with his mouth...was going to far, and not even funny at that point. If it ever makes it to regular TV, with editing, it will probably be better...in my humble opinion. 7 stars for fun and humor, 2 stars for over-the-top ""raunch"" and language. 12/2012"

","This movie was funny as long as you do not associate it with the TV show of the same name. I was a huge 21 Jump Street fan in the 80's and I was disappointed in the movie at the start.<br/><br/>Ten minutes in I decided to watch the movie as something that had nothing to do with the show and was able to enjoy the comedy of it. It really did make me laugh and if they do a sequel I would watch it once it made its way to TV, but I would not waste money on the theater or a video rental. It kind of reminded me of some Ben Stiller movie, funny but pretty stupid and lacking any real point.<br/><br/>**Spoiler: I would have given it a higher rating if they did not kill off a few beloved characters from the TV show."

","After the uneven, not-so-good results of other remakes of 80s TV series like ""Charlie's Angels,"" ""Miami Vice,"" or ""The A-Team,"" I was not really expecting to like this remake of ""21 Jump Street."" This is especially since it was going to be a comedy, which usually mocks the original, instead of pay tribute to it. However, with critics fawning all over it with rave reviews, I was compelled to give it a chance.<br/><br/>Like the original TV series that inspired it, a couple of young-looking cops -- fat nerd Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and dimwit jock Jenko (Channing Tatum) -- are given the assignment to go undercover in a high school to investigate the proliferation of designer drugs. The film follows their misadventures as the case also challenges them individually and tests their friendship. After raunchy comedies had their heyday last year (with ""Hangover 2,"" ""Bridesmaids,"" ""Horrible Bosses""), the gross-out gags here were tame in comparison. I did not enjoy seeing high school kids being bullies or drug addicts or foul-mouths. However, the chemistry between the two leads, and the heart of the storyline about their friendship did make a difference. The surprise climactic cameo guest appearances were very welcome indeed, though I was disappointed about how that ended.<br/><br/>I have not seen ""Superbad"" which launched Jonah Hill into comic superstardom. I only knew him from his more serious Oscar-nominated turn in ""Moneyball."" He is quite funny as Schmidt. He was not afraid to make fun of himself. Anyone who would not be embarrassed about running around in a dorky green Peter Pan costume while chasing criminals should be given top props. Channing Tatum is more known as a romantic lead (""Step Up"") or action hero (""GI Joe""), so he was the unknown quantity in this movie. While his straight man act is quite unexpectedly okay, he still looked a bit uncomfortable in a lot of scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was OK. It was a hilarious and fun ride in general, and it had a heart amidst all that. Warning though that you would have to go through rough patches of obscenities and drug scenes involving high school kids which may not really sit well with all audiences."

","Incompetent cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are assigned to a special squad where youthful looking officers are placed undercover in schools to investigate juvenile criminality: in their case, a new drug. In a curious reversal of when they were at school together, dozy jock Jenko is no longer cool, while dumpy nerd Schmidt is.<br/><br/>Being British, and therefore unexposed to the TV series to which this film purports to be a reworking, I can ignore the former and concentrate on the latter.<br/><br/>This is very much a comedy in the modern style: vast amounts of bad language and a fair amount of drug use (but very little sex: US cinema likes to talk about it, but not show it). I tend not to like films which rely on this for their humour: fortunately, 21 Jump Street has at its heart a) an effective situation, and b) a relationship between two fundamentally decent men. I'm not a big Jonah Hill fan, but he continues to surprise me by not playing the same character in every film. And Channing Tatum shows that the comedy flair he demonstrated in The Dilemma was no fluke.<br/><br/>This film is quite funny - I chuckled often, though I didn't find it anywhere near as uproariously funny as the squinting, shrieking, sheepdog-fringed queen of UK TV film reviews (or her smug, sofa-sharing sidekick) seemed to. And I was somewhat uneasy at the way the climax tried to marry humour and violence. But overall, if you are OK with the language, drugs and violence, this may be worth a visit."

","The above line is not the verdict of an embittered film critic, but delivered by a character in this fundamentally successful big screen remake of the late '80s American TV show.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is film comedy in its finest form. The movie is comfortable being weird, it uses vulgarity but never as a crutch, it gives every actor a chance to shine, and it all works so well that you barely stop to consider that Schmidt's love-interest is a high-schooler (Brie Larson). The movie is good-natured but unapologetic in trying to make the audience laugh as hard as possible for as long as possible.

"StevePulaski","8","3","10","17 March 2012"," Exists in a world driven by two buddies and a formula, yet still finds ways to sidestep pitiful, unnecessary indulgence
","We've come a long way in the field of satires, homages, and parodies, and I suppose that any hope for a straightforward, honest attempt at a film on the Fox show 21 Jump Street is out of the question. Sort of like how we'll probably never see a serious Sherlock Holmes film, since the current ones are very comedic and lack the sophisticated tone of the original shows. The new film, 21 Jump Street, is the R-rated, raucous take on a show that aired back in 1987. To modern audiences, that fact has little importance and is probably not even known. I'm sure some haven't realized why Johnny Depp shows up in a brief but charming cameo. <br/><br/>I never watched the program, but know a great deal about it. I can say that the film explores the topic a lot more, using tactics only allowed in an R-rated film. Car chases, explosions, drinking, smoking, and the excessive use of four-letter words to name a few. It's nice to see a decent adaptation of a TV show from many years ago. After watching the lukewarm, unnecessary Dukes of Hazzard, I needed the optimism and reassurance that a successful TV show adaptation can be made.<br/><br/>The film is centered on Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum), who lived in completely different worlds in high school, with Schmidt being the stereotypical nerd and Jenko being the limelight-soaked jock. Eight years later, both have the same sort of personalities, but are both in a police academy. Schmidt excels in the writing portion of the academy, but flounders in his physical performance, and that's the direct opposite for Jenko. The two realize they can benefit each other in their slouching fields, and quickly become the friends they never thought they'd be.<br/><br/>They become officers, and live a life well below modesty, patrolling a rather quiet park on bicycles. After miserably failing their first arrest, their boss sends them to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube, who scores some of the film's biggest laughs), an angry, vicious leader who helps disguise young-looking cops into high-schoolers so they can hunt down illegal substances being sold in a school and ""infiltrate the drugs and find the supply."" Schmidt and Jenko, perhaps, have too much fun with their new job and begin to break every rule possible, resulting in never ending camaraderie, chaos, and misunderstood circumstances. Despite this, the film has a way bigger heart than The Sitter, Hill's last film released in December, and Tatum handles his comedy debut very well, showing signs of a bright future in the area.<br/><br/>The buddy cop formula has been beaten into the ground, and there doesn't seem to be much material existing to freshen it. Thankfully, 21 Jump Street isn't indulgent, meaning it's not always in the state where it believes it's doing something unique, passionate, or original. It knows it exists in a world driven by two buddies and a formula, so it decides to have a little fun with its premise and its off-the-wall, implausible ideas. It has the ability to make fun of itself, while still occupying confidence; a rare, often challenging trait to excel at today, and probably an even more challenging thing to accomplish from a new screenwriter. It just so happens, this is the best buddy cop comedy I've seen in years. Better than The Other Guys, and a lot better than Kevin Smith's Cop Out. And that is because of Michael Bacall's hip, witty screenplay that evokes excitement and laughter charmingly and not forcefully.<br/><br/>Of course, 21 Jump Street doesn't find itself on the same level of some raunchy comedies, mainly Apatow's, like Knocked Up and Superbad. There is a bit too much of a focus on car chases, including one lengthy race at the end that sort of runs its course after a while. This is one of those cases where the action is coherently depicted, but the result is pretty conventional - despite the use of limousines. Even with that being said, 21 Jump Street is still a bag of bright satisfaction, with few weak spots. It's cheery, engaging, rarely becomes winded, and utilizes the functional blend of eventful debauchery with underlying sweetness and cheeriness. A lesson Project X should've learned and explored.<br/><br/>Starring: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Ellie Kemper, Rob Riggle, and Ice Cube. Directed by: Phil Lord and Chris Miller."
"DICK STEEL","8","3","11","15 March 2012"," A Nutshell Review: 21 Jump Street
","It's looking like a trend now with animated film directors diving into making live action features, with Brad Bird successfully taking the Mission: Impossible series to new heights, while Andrew Stanton struggled to make the century old John Carter interesting and relevant. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who were responsible for the film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, brought the same enthusiasm felt from that animated feature into a series based on a premise that served as the inspiration for other films in film industries from Hong Kong's Fight Back to School, to India's Main Hoon Na by Farah Khan, and made it a pure entertaining ride from start to end. There was fine balance between the serious and the slapstick, and they just knew when to pull back rather than letting a running joke run stale. Things were kept simple, sticking to the well established background where youthful looking cops get into a police programme for undercover investigations into teen crimes, with the titular address being a church used as a front that the law enforcers operate from.<br/><br/>And much of the credit goes to Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill's solid story, where they successfully interpreted the spirit of the television series, and updated it for a one-time (or perhaps more if this is successful) feature film. Keeping to the premise without trying too smart to deviate from it, and with tons of self-deprecating humour (the direct jab at Hollywood's lack of creativity is spot on and such a blast), the first few minutes had established what the new 21 Jump Street would stand for - humor and clichés delivered absolutely right that they still packed quite a punch. We're introduced to the new partners of Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), opposites in character, one time high school fiends and playing off each other's strengths in their new careers, getting assigned to a high school to sniff out a drug ring which they then have to infiltrate the dealer network in order to get to the supplier. Sounds simple, if not for their covers being accidentally mixed up, that they relive the nightmare of high school all over again, with Schmidt being mistaken for the hunkier of the duo, and Jenko being thought off as the jarhead nerd. The standard comedy of errors ensues, from infatuated school teachers to a rip-roaring sequence when the duo had to convince that they are indeed druggies, subjected to the multi-stage after effects of the lethal HFS drug as it is called, complete with condom-like packaging and cute looking logo that says it all.<br/><br/>References to other films, especially police and crime ones, were many, and hilarious, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously, preferring a fairly straightforward plot in order not to lose the audience through twists that stories these days just like to pile upon. Comedy also came from both Tatum and Hill playing with and against type simultaneously in their characters, with toilet humour rearing its head every now and then since Jonah Hill probably couldn't resist and succumbed to temptation to sneak in a couple. Vulgarities got used liberally and surprisingly doesn't come off as contrived efforts to elicit laughter, with Ice Cube playing it like a boss as Captain Dickson, the supervising detective at the helm of this revived police unit. Best of all there's still time for Jenko to get to know the new age nerds and get chummy with them - though I suspect there could have been more material here that had to give way, and for Schmidt to enter into a romance with fellow student Molly (Brie Larson). Dave Franco rounds up the recognizable cast given his doppelganger resemblance to older brother James Franco, playing a rich high school kid that I'd swear suggested at brotherly romance each time he gazes at Tatum's resident hunk.<br/><br/>But the best thing in the film, other than the plot, is the chemistry shared between Hill and Tatum. It was clear that since Hill co-wrote the story, there was more focus on his character of Schmidt and his journey to come out of the shell and build some self-esteem, versus Jenko having to learn what it's like being the bullied rather than the bully, and becoming exposed as being a dumb jock at every turn, if not for his sense of loyalty to build upon. But when put together, they play off each other so well that you'll clamour for more of their screen time together, rather than going off on their separate objectives in the same mission. With heavy hints at bromance, this film probably won't be as successful without both playing outside of their stereotype, put in situations that milked this camaraderie to the maximum, challenging clichés which inevitably exist in the genre. I couldn't imagine any other two actors who can pull off what they managed to do with the film's premise and material.<br/><br/>There's a much talked about cameo that happened, and fans of 21 Jump Street will probably acknowledge the attempts at closure for the television series, and the high-five passing of the baton to the new film version. It's a surprise package, surpassing what would be everyone's mediocre expectations of the film, only to come off pleasantly pleased at solid, mass entertainment. Highly recommended!"

Especially after the first half of the picture, almost every action , or word uttered sounds and looks (is, would be as accurate ) idiotic.. And not in a good way... The gags and and attempts made to proccur laughter are based on the idiotic behavior of the characters and we are asked to lower or suspend our mental capacity in order to find this enjoyable. It is what it is . Unispired and stupid... There are also some crude moments which again lack originality and look far from convincing.It is not clever or surealistic enough to be a farce or a parody. It is not so bad that it's good...

While I understand why some people don't like this form of humor, it doesn't make 21 Jump Street a bad film. And, while the comedy was never Monty Python, it never went overboard (except in one scene). But I digress.<br/><br/>People act as if a film needs to be a British satire to be enjoyed.

And boy does it do a good job. <br/><br/>THE GOOD<br/><br/>1)It doesn't take itself seriously<br/><br/>Honestly, the fact that this film never takes itself seriously is probably the main reason why I found myself laughing the entire time rather than pointing out what would obviously happen next. It also leads to some clever jokes. Their Officer mentions the fact that the two protagonists are overdone stereotypes, that this film is essentially a shameless reboot of an unoriginal concept, and etc... <br/><br/>2)Great Action<br/><br/>I hate films that are all action and no story (essentially I hate Michael Bay). That's why I'm happy that this film has only a few, but extremely memorable, action scenes.

I found myself extremely invested in ""what would happen next"" even though I essentially knew the answer.<br/><br/>4)The plot<br/><br/>Yeah, it's no Breaking Bad, but it works extremely well.

I am going to assume that now days they probably still use undercover officers in some high drug traffic schools, but back then these units did exist and we even had the drug detection K9s show up randomly to check out lockers and my school was in a nice neighborhood so this means it was across the board that they were trying to fight the trafficking. School is not all sports and academics, there are drug dealers and users, sometimes they are students and even teachers.

"dalelawson-1","7","2","6","21 March 2012"," Not the funniest film ever, but it was still enjoyable
","One thing I have to say before actually reviewing the film was how terrible the screening was at the cinema. It was possibly one of the worst cinema experiences of my life. After the 20 minutes of adverts and trailers the room darkened and the screen widened, the film was going to start. Then however, the cinema decided to play the trailer for 21 Jump Street (Dir. Phil Lord & Chris Miller, 2012) just before the screening of 21 Jump Street. It completely ruined the film for me as the trailer contained many of the early gags of the film.<br/><br/>Since the hit that was Superbad (Dir. Greg Mottola) in 2007, the comedy genre has been redefined with dark and sick humour taking forefront within films, with slapstick having surprisingly made a comeback as well. 21 Jump Street does not falter from the new codes and conventions established by Superbad, probably because Jonah Hill had a lot of creative control in both movies.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is simple. Two kids that hated each other in school both join the police force and become best friends. Unfortunately they are such bad cops they get initiated into a revived program on 21 Jump Street, and a forced to go undercover as high school kids. This sounds like a very cheesy 80s plot that won't work. But it does. They updated it enough to connect to a 2012 audience, while at the same time keeping the cheesiness that defined 80s comedy.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street was pretty much Hill in every other film we have seen him in. I have to say, in some of is earlier movies I found his improvisation comedy refreshing and hilarious. Now, however, his jokes really haven't changed and his comedic style is becoming a little tedious, which is a shame. The real comedy star in this film was Channing Tatum, who actually fitted into this role with ease. I am hoping that his ability will improve with experience as he is a genuinely enjoyable screen presence.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are hilarious in this film. Notably a scene where they are both attempting to get drugs out of their system I found particularly funny. However, like many comedies nowadays, there are also some very unfunny scenes. I do not enjoy slapstick jokes in the slightest and I just do not enjoy films that rely on that form of comedy. I understand it exists to allow people to not think while watching the film and just to laugh, but I feel like it is a dated and child-like comedic form, and I much prefer intertextual jokes and witty dialogue.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is better than I thought it would be, but is not at the same comedic level as other hits like Superbad or The Hangover (Dir. Todd Philips, 2009). This film utilizes many forms of comedy, most probably to attract as bigger audience as possible; which is has. The acting is as it should be in a comedy film, apart from a cameo near the end which was mind-blowingly fantastic. 21 Jump Street has been a success as it has stuck to what people between the ages of 15-25 enjoy, which includes me. It was not the funniest film I have ever seen, but it was certainly not the least funny either.<br/><br/>http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com"

Hill asks, 'Why me?' Tatum screams, ""You're the one in the f***ing Peter Pan costume!"" ""21 Jump Street"" is hysterical! It has got to be the funniest movie of the year.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are awesome together and elevate Bromance to another level. They have a distinct goofy and sweet bond. Jonah Hill also wrote the story with screenwriter Michael Bacall based on the beloved 90's TV series which distinguished Johnny Depp. Depp also has an outrageous cameo as Hanson. Along with Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"") this ""Jump Street"" is juggernaut parody with an amazingly authentic high school culture vibe. ""21 Jump Street"" is hilarious and arrestingly cool.<br/><br/>Hill and Bacall brilliantly take humorous shots at everyone blurring all lines. On the first day of school undercover, Jenko (Tatum) punches an African American teen; who he thinks gets in his face, turns out the kid is gay. Jenko says he didn't know he was gay. The kids verbally attack him for punching a gay kid. Deadpan Schmidt (Hill) says, ""So in a weird way, he is homophobic if he didn't hit him?"" The logic escapes me, but the moment is classic. After getting their undercover assignment at abandoned street church, Schmidt prays, ""Hey Korean Jesus"" There is actually a Korean Jesus on the cross. Jenko cracks up at Schmidt from behind.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill are deadpan genius. With Jonah Hill you kind of expect this. Channing Tatum is brilliantly funny. Tatum is undercover with a bunch of science geeks, one kid asks, ""So you were held back (2 years)?"" He replies, ""So you were held forward (2 years)?"" Will Ferrell would be proud. Obviously, ""21 Jump Street"" leverages the polarized personas. Tatum is the ripped handsome action guy playing the stupid jock. Hill, who slimmed down, is the vulnerable nerd, who wants to be cool. Both play in position. After being mortal enemies in high school they reunite 7 years later at the Police Academy. Jenko says, ""Hey not so Slim Shady, what's up?"" Schmidt aces all the written exams. The physical training is cake for Jenko. They wisely form a partnership. Here Lord and Miller believably transform cultural opposites into best buds—the underlying sweetness of ""21 Jump Street"". The humor always pushes the envelope, but they are never ever mean spirited. And there are a lot of penis jokes— most of them hilarious.<br/><br/>Jenko and Schmidt graduate. However, their ""lifetime of being bad asses"" takes an unfortunate turn. They are assigned as bike cops on park patrol. After a botched arrest and hilarious Miranda rights screw up, the duo are assigned to 21 Jump Street. Director of the program Captain Dickson, played with funny angry gusto by Ice Cube, informs everyone, ""You are here because you are Justin Beiber, Miley Cyrus looking mother f***ers!"" Dickson wants Schmidt and Jenko to go undercover at their old high school and find the supplier of a particularly deadly designer drug. They watch YouTube videos of the stages of intoxication. While undercover they live with Schmidt's proud parents (funny Cardine Aaron and Joe Chrest). Pointing out an embarrassing kid glamor photo, Jenko says, ""You look like a young Jay Leno."" <br/><br/>High school has changed from 2005. The cool kids are the preppy environmentally conscious teens lead by Eric (slick charming Eric Franco). Not memorizing their student identities Schmidt ends up on the track team and drama class, while Jenko goes to class with science nerds in AP Chemistry. So while Jenko learns about covalent bonds, Schmidt meets popular Molly (ironic and perky Brie Larson). Schmidt may have a shot at redemption for his high school romantic crash and burn. Rob Riggles is ridiculously funny as gym teacher Mr. Walters. He has a gut busting scene with the boys when they are as high as a kite.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, ""21 Jump Street"" poignantly gets redemption and lifetime friendship. Jenko learns that he can be smart, and schools his geek brothers in being cool. There is an awesome montage with doves. The not so inside joke works: Tatum and Hill don't look at all like high school kids. After Jenko beats the crap out of bullies at their house party with his slick mixed martial arts skills, he stares in shock at Schmidt. Schmidt says, ""When did I get stabbed? That's awesome!"" Tatum and Hill have an endearing chemistry: they are funny together and you get that they really pull for each other. They redefine comedic Bromance in ""21 Jump Street"". I am absolutely waiting for ""Jump Street 2"". In the meantime, see ""21 Jump Street""."
"Chris_Pandolfi","7","2","6","16 March 2012"," The TV Drama Gets a Comedic Big Screen Makeover
","""21 Jump Street"" treads on thin ice in an early scene where it's explained that the police department has revived a specialty division that started in the 1980s, that it's part of a trend of resurrecting and modernizing old programs due to a lack of original ideas, and that they're hoping the public won't notice. Nothing threatens to ruin a movie faster than winking at the audience in a showy display of self-referential humor. Fortunately, the filmmakers had the foresight to get this out of the way as quickly as possible. The rest of the film is a surprisingly entertaining romp, one that has an emotional core despite being pervasively crude and at times highly violent. The filmmakers even work in two unexpected but very welcome cameo appearances. No, I won't say who makes them.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: I have not watched a single episode of the original TV series. According to Wikipedia, it was a police drama in which young-looking undercover police officers infiltrated high schools and colleges to investigate crimes. Thankfully, that tidbit of information tells me everything I need to know. Although utilizing the exact same premise, this film adaptation has been transformed from a procedural drama into a raunchy comedy. You'd think such a drastic shift in tone would be fatal for this material, but in fact, it works fairly well. This is helped in large part by the casting of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, who are not only individually funny but also rank as the best odd-couple pairing since Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in ""The Other Guys.""<br/><br/>It tells the story of Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum), who in high school were enemies and at polar opposite ends of the social and academic spectrums. One was bookish and nerdy while the other was an idiot jock. See if you can guess which one is which. They reunite in police academy and continue to exhibit the same traits that defined them as teens. Despite this, they become friends and soon graduate as partners. Sadly, their dreams of being badass cops on a dangerous beat are shattered when they're assigned to park patrol. They think they finally have their chance at glory when they spot a group of drug dealers and attempt to take them down. Miraculously, they do arrest one of them. But because Jenko forgot to read him his Miranda rights, the department was forced to release him.<br/><br/>This lands both Jenko and Schmidt in hot water. As punishment, they're reassigned to the revived 21 Jump Street division, located within an abandoned church and presided over by the perpetually angry Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). He explains the division's purpose in much the same way I did a few paragraphs ago, albeit with many more obscene references to Oedipus. Schmidt and Jenko are to infiltrate a high school where a new synthetic drug is rapidly becoming popular. Their mission: Prevent it from spreading to other schools and discover the identities of both the dealer and the supplier. Hoping to ensure that their covers aren't blown, they pose as brothers and move in with Schmidt's parents. Let's just say they have turned their house into an eclectic and somewhat frightening shrine to their son.<br/><br/>As the saying goes, wacky hijinx ensue. Schmidt and Jenko assume the wrong student identities, meaning the former will have to join the Drama Club and Track and Field whereas the latter has to take chemistry classes. They track down the dealer – an eco-friendly, racially tolerant, and highly popular teen named Eric (Dave Franco). They try the drug and experience a high unlike any other. In a complete reversal of their actual high school days, Schmidt becomes popular and even develops romantic feelings for one of his Drama Club classmates, a young woman named Molly (Brie Larson); at the same time, Jenko becomes an outcast and soon befriends all the science nerds, who are surprisingly adept at turning cell phones into surveillance devices. There's even time for a frenetic car chase, a few more run-ins with the drug dealers Schmidt and Jenko tried to bust earlier in the movie, and several well-placed explosions.<br/><br/>What I appreciated about this film was that a real buddy story lurked underneath the foul language and disgusting sexual references. We really do get the sense that Schmidt and Jenko are friends, especially during the final shootout sequence at the senior prom. I also appreciated what I interpreted to be a commentary on the high school experience. If you had the chance to do certain things over again – say, finally working up the nerve to ask the girl you like to the prom – would you take it? Would you treat other people differently, knowing what you know now? The fact that ""21 Jump Street"" even alluded to these questions shows that the filmmakers were thinking beyond the scope of teenagers with short attention spans. They wanted to make a movie that was both funny and insightful.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

There are enough laughs and yes- Depp has a cameo which should excite older fans and the film is basically a satire of the 80s in many ways.

","Anybody who watched the straight-faced Johnny Depp television cop series ""21 Jump Street"" (1987 thru 1992) probably won't appreciate the low-brow, comedic, big-screen adaptation co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Incredibly enough, co-directors Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, who went on the helm the hilariously funny ""The Lego Movie,"" called the,shots on this lowest-common denominator parody. ""Project X"" scenarist Michael Bacall and an uncredited Jonah Hill scrape the bottom of the barrel for humor in this relentlessly-profane, R-rated comedy that is hopelessly far-fetched when it isn't completely infantile. The best thing about ""21 Jump Street"" is the wacky bromance that Parks and Miller made out of this comedy.<br/><br/>Our two heroes were enemies in high school before they joined the Metropolitan City Police. Schmidt (Jonah Hill of ""Superbad"") and Jenko (Channing Tatum of ""White House Down"")wind up becoming best buddies at the police academy and lend each other a hand to graduate in their areas of expertise. Schmidt is the nerd who chokes when he asks for a date to prom, while Jenko is the jock with no practical knowledge. Eventually, they find themselves assigned to patrol a park on bicycles. After they arrest their first suspect but forget to advise him about his Miranda rights, their commander, Deputy Chief Hardy (Ned Offerman of ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"") transfers them to an undercover narcotics operation at 21 Jump Street. <br/><br/>Naturally, it has become a Hollywood cliché that the actors and actresses cast as teens are far too old for those roles. The same holds true for both Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. They no more look like they could infiltrate the ranks of a high school than they could masquerade as newborns in the maternity ward. Several times throughout their undercover operation, the high school student observe that they appear too old for school. Nevertheless, Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko enter high school and struggle to blend in with the other students. Eventually, our dim-witted heroes stumble onto the drug dealers in high school selling the synthetic H.F.S., but they aren't racking up one bust after another like their counterparts in other undercover operations. The first time that they meet the student on the inside, the guy forces them to take the drug in front of him. Our heroes do everything possible to stop from taking the drug, but they realize that if they don't, they will blow their cover. Ironically, our heroes aren't deemed trustworthy until they make utter buffoons of themselves during the Peter Pan school play.<br/><br/>Most of the humor is borderline slapstick, and the action scenes are pretty tame. The car swapping stunt that they do in gridlock traffic is amusing. Ice Cube is hilarious as our heroes' loud-mouth superior who uses profanity at the least provocation. The scene that is most gross occurs near the end when they expose the man behind the narcotics ring at school. Jenko catches a bullet in the shoulder, while Schmidt shoots off the drug dealer's penis. His hands zip-tied behind his back, the villain gets on his knees and picks up his severed member in his mouth. The basic plot has our heroes tangling with the same drug dealers that they dealt with in the park. Lord and Miller skewer all the clichés, not only the standard procedural clichés, but also some others. When was the last time that a remake killed the two heroes of the television show?"
"manar_alrawahi","8","1","2","11 June 2014"," Excellent Comedy Movie!
","The Late-1980s pop culture relic 21 Jump Street was a primo specimen of a TV police procedural with a catchy hook: A team of fresh-faced cops work undercover as high school kids, reporting back to their tough/earnest boss at the address listed above. The hit series ran for four years, and was notably progressive in its willingness to incorporate newsmaking social issues, including AIDS, homophobia, and child abuse. But 25 years later, 21 Jump Street the TV show is remembered primarily as the career kickstarter of Johnny Depp as a young actor with an obvious something. As it turns out, dim memories and a new generation of pop culture consumers work to the great advantage of 21 Jump Street the movie: What this fast, cheeky, and very funny interpretation of the original premise sacrifices in teachable moments, it makes up for in intelligent giddiness. Shaped by the precocious comedic smarts of talent-on-a-roll Jonah Hill (who not only costars but also developed the story with Michael Bacall and is one of the executive producers), the movie morphs into an action comedy with a tonal complexity that marks it as a very contemporary creative project. It's part homage and part wink at the past. It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years. It bridges slapstick and action. It's quick-witted with its pop references. Oh, have you heard? Depp makes a delightful cameo appearance! On the surface, 21 Jump Street follows the crime-fighting antics of odd- couple cop partners Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum). Their wonky dynamic is established in a perfectly placed opening flashback to 2005, when the two were real high school students — Schmidt the klutzy, anxious nerd with a brain; Jenko the athletic, academically challenged coolio. Seven years later, when both police rookies are coincidentally assigned to an undercover–high schooler program, the duo are prepared to play out those same life scripts, until a mix-up alters fate. Schmidt is assigned a class schedule befitting a popular non-Einstein; Jenko is shuffled into advanced-placement chemistry. (''Ap-chemistry,'' he calls it, laboriously reading his course list.) Given a do-over, the two get to re-experience those less than wonder years. They get to work issues out. And by the way they get to bust a drug ring fronted by a smart and popular guy played with oddball charisma by Dave Franco. (The curiosity isn't that he's the brother of James Franco; it's that he's so interestingly weird. Okay, like his brother.) But that, as I say, is on the surface. Underneath, 21 Jump Street is a riot of risks that pay off, the biggest of which might be handing Tatum funny business. And now for the revelation: The guy's got bust-out talents as a really funny, self-aware comic actor. With all appropriate salutes to the busy fellow's famous abs, and with full forgiveness for his participation in The Vow, I am feeling the Channing charm for the first time. And wow, those scenes where the smart actor, playing a ''dumb'' character who realizes he's not as dumb as he has always believed he is, fakes playing a dumb guy to mess with his smart partner's head are kind of perfect. Also, Tatum can sustain a great, I mean great, Dumb Face. Under the limber direction of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs), and working from a screenplay by Bacall — a script jammed, by the way, with so many oinky references to male reproductive equipment that I choose to believe the producers were rising to a dare — Hill and Tatum play their Mutt-and-Jeff act against a supporting cast equally fast on their feet. A refresher viewing of any old Jump Street episode may sharpen your appreciation for the kind of earnest '80s-TV police captain that Ice Cube is tweaking in his funky turn as Schmidt and Jenko's boss, but the joke is equally welcome without the historical background. Explaining why he's assigning Schmidt and Jenko to shutting down the school drug ring after the death of one student, the captain tells it true: ''This kid is white, so people actually give a s---.'' There's room for laughs and truth at this newly reopened address."
"Rage-Kage","8","1","2","7 June 2014"," A great action comedy
","Okay so I'm definitely late to the party with this review but with 22 Jump Street coming out soon I decided to go ahead and review this one. I first saw this movie a while back around the time it was first released but I had not seen it since so I re watched it last night. I was pretty glad that I did it was just as good the second time around. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have surprisingly good on screen chemistry you really believe that these guys are best friends. I really don't get all the hate that Channing Tatum gets. I mean Okay I get it he's Hollywoods pretty boy but that does not automatically mean that he is not talented.<br/><br/>One big thing that I always look for in a good comedy is at least a little substance aside from just being funny. My favorite comedy movies have more to them then just a lot of funny lines. They have a decent story and cool relatable and likable characters and this movie excels at that. As funny as this movie is there is still a lot more to it than just that. The story of these two idiots trying become better cops by uncovering a drug ring is so entertaining. I also really like how this movie knows exactly what it it is. They even go as far as to make fun of the fact that this movie is a sort of remake of an 80's TV show though the two are almost nothing alike. It's really funny to see how originally in high school Cahnning Tatum was the popular one but the second time around Jonah Hill is because things just are not the same as they were in high school just a few years ago. Though The way school was that second time is nothing like my high school experience was which ended right around the time this movie was released.<br/><br/>Another big highlight in this movie is the great action. I don't typically come out of a comedy movie thinking wow those action scenes were cool but this movie did a great job. The car chases are intense the shoot outs are intense and it's all really funny all the way through. So overall this movie had it all a lot of comedy, cool action, good acting, and good likable characters.<br/><br/>I give 21 Jump Street an 8/10"
"jackbanister16","8","1","2","19 May 2014"," One of the better comedies in the last 5 years.
","Some would say, ""The Hangover,"" was one of the better blockbuster comedies of the past decade, but in all fairness, I think this movie gives it a run for its money.<br/><br/>Featuring Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube, Dave Franco, Ron Giggle, and a cameo the original characters from 21 Jump Street, you can tell thought was put into the casting. There is palpable comedic chemistry between Hill and Tatum from the moment we encounter the two boneheads in the police academy. They play off of each other very well and it creates a really humorous take on the show. Channing Tatum, in my opinion at least, is at his very best when he's in a comedy. He does dramatic just fine, but he's too damn funny NOT to explore his comedic talents. Hill brings his hilarious mile a minute dialog character into this movie to GREAT effect. You can't help but have fun watching this duo in the script. Ice Cube plays his same tired character in this movie BUT it's cleverly written and timed so his performance is a riot. I bust a gut every time I see him address the ""Jump Street"" division... ""Everybody comfortable...?"" HAHA.<br/><br/>The writing is pretty good. It's a clean script. It presents us with the objective, it presents us with the characters and a bit of their background, and it gives us a satisfactory ending. Structurally speaking, it's nothing that hasn't been done before, but it is just brought to life by good acting The film is technically sound. Camera work and special effects are done very effectively. Snappy editing keeps us interested yet doesn't distract us from the performances being given; very well done. The blood effects, though CGI, were done well and didn't take you out of the moment (the final gun fight). Overall a job well done by the production team.<br/><br/>My only beef with the movie are too many penis jokes and at one point, they actually show male genitalia (something I have no interest in seeing...) The writing was great, but did rely on too many penis jokes at times. It seems to be a trend (at least the last 5 years) for these type of comedies to try and shock you by putting in a shot of the male genitalia...It's not really shocking because I have a penis and certainly know what it looks like, but seeing it on the big screen is just nasty and not funny. It's a comedic trend that I am definitely against. I don't find body part humor very funny in general, but hey that's just me.<br/><br/>Aside from that, be sure to see this movie. I could easily see it becoming a classic in the next ten years, it's that funny! If you like Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum, be sure to check this one out. Even if you don't this one is for sure worth the watch. It'll make you laugh."
"nlytnd_1","8","1","2","20 February 2014"," Decent movie, takes a somewhat original spin on several movie cliché's mixed with a little Superbad!
","Even though I have a man crush on Jonah Hill, 21 Jump Street I never considered watching, until I read a little more on it and figured it would be a chance to see some of the Seth character from Superbad (which it had). For one this is a horribly titled movie. Who the hell gives a crap about the late 80's television show 21 Jump Street? When that show was airing, I didn't know a single person who watched it. Also the last character I would want my man crush to play was a cop. There is nothing cool about being a cop and there is nothing ethical about busting people for putting something in their own body. With that said, this movie didn't take the cop role very seriously. Around the time when Doug and Brad had the house party supplying alcohol and drugs to high school peeps I was cool with this movie. There was still the lingering thought of, yeah, but they're going to eventually bust the drug seller and supplier. Well, the movie goes out of it's way to make the ring extremely shady folk, although I could have done without the kid being arrested even though he's a total chode. Anyways, this movie does nothing to promote cops or the drug war, which makes it watchable, at least for me. <br/><br/>21 Jump Street is no masterpiece, but it has some funny moments and is mildly entertaining. I can't believe they're making a second movie though. I'm guessing Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum signed to a sequel in their initial contracts, because there is no way in hell Jonah Hill would have done a sequel to this movie. BTW not really familiar with Channing Tatum prior to this movie, but he's a good actor as well. <br/><br/>This movie was full of cliché's, although each cliché has an original spin. The uncoordinated dorky smart guy teams up with the coordinated cool dumb guy. Most of you probably aren't familiar with the movie Class Act, but the names get mixed and the cool kid and nerdy kid switch roles (I'm sure this has been done in several movies over the years). 21 Jump Street takes this cliché and puts enough of it's own spin on it to own it. You also get to see a little of Jonah Hill's Seth character from Superbad, which is good. This movie also doesn't entirely ride out the prom cliché, but it runs through it.<br/><br/>I have a hard time with the fine line of believable far fetched comedy (in the generic sense) and stupid far fetched comedy. This movie has it's share of both. When a movie starts killing people like it's a cartoon or a video game it knocks down the genuine comedy feel a couple of notches. Superbad had it's ultra far fetched moments, but maintained a genuine feel throughout the movie, this movie does not. Johny Depp and the other dude from 21 jump street getting killed (could have done without either) in conjunction with the ""bad guys"", kind of kills the celebration moment when Doug and Brad ""save the day"". <br/><br/>Overall this movie was decent. I would give it a 65-70 out of 100. Jonah Hill must have had a serious payday though to take this role even though he's ordinarily good at passing up money deals to be in quality roles. This was a decent movie decision for Hill, probably a big payday and he lost weight in the process. Part II on the other hand, not good, but I doubt it will have a negative effect on his career at this point."
"Vincent_B","8","1","2","20 January 2014"," Enjoyable Police Comedy
","First I want the reader to note that the community ""average rating"" is a seven so I liked it a bit more than everyone else did. Not being part of the 1980s pop culture, that obviously enjoyed the TV series, I seem to have enjoyed the movie for what is was meant to be. The movie is a hilarious police comedy. The TV series (what little I saw of it) was a dull action drama with teen issues and teen fans too.<br/><br/>This movie parodies a lot of the typical things we see --far too much of-- in today's action films. The movie shows two young men who despite being polar opposites join the police academy to see action, explosions, car chases, and bullets flying. Yes, they join for all the wrong reasons. After their first big bust, they are assigned to 21 Jump Street because 7 years after high school they still look very young. But they are assigned mostly to be punished.<br/><br/>The acting is above par for this kind of film. The dialog and plot are great. The gags are over the top. It is funny to see two adults return to high school after 7 years to find out nothing is the same as before. If you get a chance watch it with your friends and not your mom and dad or anyone else who is a ""fan"" of the TV series."
"donuthaters12","8","1","2","5 October 2013"," A Unique Approach To A Buddy Cop Story
","21 Jump Street looks goofy when you look at it's poster, i did not watch the trailer before watching this film, but as soon as the plot moves forward it starts to get a little better. The film has great comedic actors, which was the main reason I was hooked to watching this in the first place, and is handled by new directors which grabbed my curiosity.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street's plot is not hard to follow, as found on most comedies, but what drives the film along is the references to either the TV show from the 80s or the life of high school students in the 90s. My main issue with the plot is that it feels forced and the writers didn't find a clever way to make it more layered and subtle. The characters in this film at least feel fresh, for the most part, and the film's dialogue does rely on being a little raunchy and unexpected. The buddy cop format has been tackled many times and they did just enough here to make it enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film was directed by first time live-action directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, their first film was Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs. Their transition to live-action has definitely shown that they can take a material that has a high tendency to become very cliché and campy, and make it unique. The directors definitely wanted to push beyond people's expectations and make them think ""what the f**k just happened?"" while retaining that comic quality. The best qualities of this film is the tripping out sequence as it's really in your face, comedy that I also found in films like Fight Club. Lord and Miller kept the film at a quick pace, and i think this was a great decision because if it dragged even a bit, the audience can start to see beyond the surface of the film and find it's flaws. In delivering it's comedic timing, it relies on using sudden jump cuts that work only a couple at times.<br/><br/>This film won't win any awards or turn heads on Barry Peterson's photography but it does get the job done. Not a moment I felt the film looked stale or cliché but it does feel generic and commonplace. Peterson and the directors loves to have shots focusing on the actors faces as the main focus of the film is to deliver the comedy, and a lot of the comedy comes from the delivery of the punch lines and the reactions to it.<br/><br/>Mark Mothersbaugh's score here did not win me over. It felt lazy and uninspired. This would have been a great opportunity to create a score that feels over the top and trippy, as this would complement the style that Lord and Miller was going for.<br/><br/>One of the other highlights of this film is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, as they play each other off well and bring personality to these characters in order to prevent them from being stereotypical and one-dimensional. Hill and Tatum's banter is fantastic but the dick jokes does get a little old at times. The dramatic moments though did feel a little over the top from them and I wish a little more came from their performance. Brie Larson is the love interest of Jonah Hill in this film. Larson is fantastic in this as she plays it cool and at times do feel like a high school student from this generation. She was a great casting choice as she is more cute and girl next door type rather than those stereotypically sexy high school girls. Dave Franco was great but nothing different from his other performances like in Scrubs. Rob Riggle did surprise me though as his improvisation in his lines are clever and does catch you off guard. Ice Cube was definitely over the top and did bring down the film a little bit, his comedy just didn't hit me as it did with the others.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street doesn't break any new ground but it does have enough to be enjoyable and at times unique. I definitely did not expect the comedy that would be presented in this and it did a great job in keeping me interested until the end. I'm interested to see the sequel but I hope Lord and Miller correct their mistakes from this film with 22 Jump Street."

I thought my man Jonah would steal the show and although his performance was great, it doesn't come close to Mr. tatum.

Seeing Channing Tatum with long hair in the beginning got me worried for a little bit - it's not his best look...The favorite character for me after the main ones was Captain Dickson.

I knew going in that the humor would be slapstick comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, and in that sense I enjoyed the movie to a certain degree. <br/><br/>The movie was entertaining. There were many jokes that had me laughing as well as cringing. I felt that many of the jokes were hit and miss and just did not click with my sense of humor. The Hill-Tatum duo I thought was nicely done, but could have used a little more back story back when they attended the same high school.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you want some laughs, but don't mind unnecessary penis jokes and vulgar language, this movie is worth the watch."

","Moonrise Kingdom and Silver Linings Playbook aside, the year has been dry for laugh riot comedies. Now that Judd Apatow is more-or-less scraping from the bottom of the barrel, we've been waiting patiently for someone else to take the mantle. That hasn't come yet and 21 Jump Street is nothing new, but it feels like the comedies of that peak era of foul-mouthed comedies in 2007 and 2008 with Superbad and Pineapple Express. Based on a TV show I admittedly haven't heard of, I assume they did a good job of updating it for the modern age as it's very entertaining with some great original jokes and ways of delivering them with pleasant surprises. Although it dives into its narrative with not as much development as I'd like it to have, in particular I'd like more on the bonding of the two lead characters, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, it's their bromance and great chemistry thereafter that makes the film something a little more special. Misguided special effects and an awful antagonist aside, 21 Jump Street is certainly one of the most entertaining films of the year, especially above the humourless action movies of the summer.<br/><br/>7/10"

This isn't the classic American Pie's high school anymore, even making fun of the tolerance that characterizes youth nowadays, and with a very good dose of dark humor, unbelievable situations and characters, and a very special cameo. 21 Jump Street makes fun of itself.

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as an unlikely pair of second-time-around students but they work well together - and Ice T is the funny and irreverent ""stereotypical angry black captain."" Hill (Schmidt) and Tatum (Jenko) are both playing characters similar to those they've played before but step out of their character comfort zones, they're clearly unlikely buds and this is referenced to comic effect, as is the fact that times change and coolness is fleeting. Loved seeing Jake Johnson (New Girl) and Chris Parnell (30 Rock) playing (ish) straight roles. Some of the funniest interactions in this are between Jenko and his Chem Teacher Ms Griggs - LOL every time - and the two boys on drugs. Hilarious. It's funnier the second time around, like Pineapple Express (another Franco) funny, though with lots of similar sick references and homoerotic gestures, which I don't know the point of to be honest and don't find so funny, but there's lots that is super funny and Tatum's physicality (!) is very impressive.

The plot is basic but very rhythmic in its unfolding so much that you hardly get bored, and you even surprise yourself laughing at the good gags livening up the movie.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill shows once again all his comical potential, whereas Channing Tatum seems a bit more uncomfortable and ultimately a lot more ordinary in his role, but the duo works well and that is what is important. There is also a nice, really unexpected cameo of Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Let's hope the follow-up will be at least as good."
"Maniac-9","5","1","2","11 March 2013"," Not quite as bad as I thought it would be
","Considering that I'm only giving this movie a 5 rating when it went above my expectations of it just shows how little faith I had going into this movie. I guess it's better to be a entertainingly mediocre movie like this then to be a boring movie that's not as memorable. While there might be more middle of the pack movies that have slightly better acting then this a lot of them aren't as memorable.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is still someone who's still very much learning the craft of acting and Jonah Hill while slightly better then Tatum won't get confused for Daniel Day-Lewis any time soon. But light hearted comedies like this really play to their strengths. But Ice Cube as the Captain shows he hasn't evolved as an actor at all even though he's been acting since Boyz N the Hood, which was 20 years ago."
"jose-cruz53","7","1","2","27 December 2012"," Solid entertainment
","21 jump street is solid entertainment all through. In fact, one of the most entertaining movies of this year. It has a good deal of solid comedy. Nothing more that you might hope for such type of movie. It is not art and doesn't try to be. It is a solid and entertaining movie a very good way to kill time. Though I wouldn't recommend this film very highly for hardcore film buffs, instead, watch some Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, Takahata and Kubrick, before watching second rate stuff like this.<br/><br/>It is good entertainment but I wondered whether my time was well spend or not in watching stuff like this."
"piratecannon","8","1","2","26 December 2012"," Undercover Brothers
","Who would have thought that Channing Tatum would be able to go toe-to- toe with one of the poster-boys of the comedic renaissance? Not I. Imagine my surprise, then, when the chiseled actor whose usual fare is penned by none other than the gloopy Mr. Sparks exhibits just the sort of deadpan snark that Jonah Hill is known for with expert craftsmanship. In fact, the pairing makes for one of the more memorable comic duos of the past several years, ranking up there with the Seth Rogen / James Franco collaboration that gave us Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>The story is a rehash of an earlier picture starring Johnny Depp. Two young police officers are selected for an undercover operation at a high school. They're tasked with unhinging the distribution of a narcotic that often finds its users in the morgue. As the plot thickens, we see two individuals who occupied opposite ends of the spectrum during their first foray into the world of high school—one an uber cool jock, the other a nerd who's as socially awkward as he is smart—attempting to deal with the shifting roles that finds them embodying the other's niche in unexpected ways. In this way, 21 Jump Street is a ""buddy cop"" movie. This is great in that it reinvents many of the conventions of a fairly narrow genre, but it's also a detriment in that you know (for the most part) exactly what's going to happen by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The unexpected humor is what makes the movie a standout, though. It's worth your time to see these two ""bad boy"" wannabees reference a variety of films as they fumble their way through the hormone drenched halls of a stereotypical high school while gunning down drug dealers and upending the clichés of the genre with appropriate nonchalance. Though there are times where the gratuitousness feels a tad bit unnecessary, it's funny in that cringing-because-we-can't-believe-they-actually-went-there-sort- of-way. The fact that the two leading men are able to elicit laughs while sending up a multitude of well-known action flicks is admirable, and there's no doubt that anyone willing to give Tatum a chance as he embodies an atypical role will not be disappointed."

","With juvenile humor and extensive cursing throughout the entire film this comedy was abundantly clear it is for adults. The humor is suggestive throughout and the dialouge is written rather well. Jonha Hill and Channing Tatum are clearly hilarious together. Even the action sequences were put together nicely and humorous overtones.<br/><br/>The scripts was also written by Jonha Hill and for something of this nature it was rather well done. Loosely based on the classic TV show of the 80's but all in all an good film. I would recommend this to everyone.<br/><br/>I am sure there is going to be a sequel or two rolling off the original and if they are done as well as this one it could turn into a wealthy franchise."
"octopusluke","7","1","2","4 December 2012"," the popcorn comedy of 2012!
","Last week, I caught the new David Ayer movie End of Watch, an impressive first-person cop movie, with a gooey buddy-cop heart. 21 Jump Street is similarly derivative (it's premise is based on a forgotten eighties TV series), but it knowingly accepts the standardised rehashing culture of Hollywood; subverting the clichés and conventions of it's heritage and make them work for a contemporary audience.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill star as Jenko and Schmidt. Meeting back in high school, they were polar opposites: Jenko was the hot, dumb jock, and Schmidt the shlubby dork, with Slim Shady hair and an inability to keep his cool. Seven years on, the pair enrol into police academy and soon realise that they are the perfect combo of brawn and brain. It's the start of a beautiful friendship, but a flawed park patrol team.<br/><br/>After a failed drug heist, they are sent to work undercover with the self-proclaimed ""stereotypical angry black police captain"" Dickson (Ice Cube), who runs the down-town Jump Street program. The no-nonsense law enforcer sends the hapless pair undercover at a local high school to bust a drug circle selling a dangerous new chemical high.<br/><br/>The ridiculous scenario would make for mundane screwball comedy material (think Never Been Kissed, or Miss Congeniality), but writers Hill and Michael Bacall – the second of which penned the excellent Scott Pilgrim vs. The World - elevate the scenario with a comment on the fickle American teen culture of today – where the cool kids are tolerant eco-warriors, and geeks' chatter of covalent bonds is admired.<br/><br/>Hill and Tatum make for an amiable team.There's no straight man, and the pairs constant to- and-fro bromance rekindles some of the magic between Nick Frost and Simon Pegg in the British comedies Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. The support is great too, most notably 30 Rock's Dr. Spacemen/SNL ensemble man Michael Bacall as the high school's irreverent drama teacher. During a reflexive overload, there's an incredibly plotted cameo from one mega- Hollywood star once affiliated with the original series, with a TV in the background playing one of the show's classic episodes.<br/><br/>As is expected, 21 Jump Street has it's fair share of crass dick-jokes, gross out moments, and implausible car chases. Just like their brilliant animation adventure Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller rifle through the jokes at such a breakneck speed that they are able to shift between the tones of sincerity and self-deprecation effortlessly.<br/><br/>I'll admit it, I snubbed 21 Jump Street when it was released earlier this year. Who needs another cliché buddy-cop comedy? Who wants more of Jonah Hill's chubby funster schtick? Aside from teenage girls, who wants Channing Tatum, period? To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. 21 Jump Street has no right being as downright hilarious as it is, but the universally strong comedic performances, frantic pacing and a taut script make this the best popcorn comedy of the year.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at www.366movies.com"

","Two rookie police officers, who both went to high school together, one popular and one described as a jerk, graduate and years later wind up at the police academy.<br/><br/>The film is just as much about how the two build a relationship and discover themselves whether it be in the drama or chemistry class. The movie tries to show you that during difficult circumstances, one can persevere.<br/><br/>That being said, the film is still a comedy in how these two officers go undercover to a high school to uncover a drug ring there. The results are most surprising, but in today's world anything goes.<br/><br/>Ice Cube co-stars as a no nonsense head of their unit. Too much cursing is shown in this film. It does detract somewhat from the story."

","What happens when you take an overweight, intelligent, socially awkward ""adult"" and put him in the same police academy with same emotionally stunted athlete who made his life miserable all through high school?<br/><br/>Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) had dyed-blonde hair and braces in the twelfth grade so, naturally, when he attempted to ask out his high school crush, he choked and was shot down anyway. While this was devastating to him, Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) found it hysterical and made no effort to hide it. The shoe was eventually on the other foot, however, when the principal revealed that Jenko (Tatum) would not be allowed to graduate. Years later, in the police academy, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko meet again, they decide to help each other overcome their respective shortcomings and, in so doing, graduate. But a screw-up results in their first arrest being invalidated and, as punishment, they're reassigned to a program that was discontinued in the 80's and brought back because ""the guys upstairs ran out of ideas years ago"". Their new headquarters: 21 Jump Street. Under the direction of their captain (Ice Cube), they're sent undercover as high school students to find the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a white high school student after he'd posted a video of himself under the influence of said drug and posted it on YouTube.<br/><br/>The inside jokes about the basis for this movie being a television program from the 80's and cameo appearances from two former cast members are hilarious. Also entertaining is the sharp contrast in youth culture between today and ten years ago. Hill is basically playing a role he's played several times before, ditto for Tatum, and Ice Cube, playing a role that even the cast admits is cliché, is fantastic. If you haven't already, see this movie."

","This movie was surprising funny to me. I went into watching this film, not expecting much but some lame, overused dialogue filled with predictable sequences and so on. But I was quite surprised. The film was a whole lot better than I expected.<br/><br/>The start was great, showing us a few flashbacks and so on. After Jenko and Schdmit are sent to 21 Jump Street, things quieten down for a while. The story builds up and so serves as a build up to a great finish.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is very good, in particular Channing Tatum and Jonah Hills. The duo were brilliant in this film and were just hilarious.<br/><br/>The final battle scenes were great and there were many hilarious moments. For eg:<br/><br/>Doug or Schmidt throwing the gun at the guy instead of shooting him Schmidt shooting off the penis and the Miranda rights said The final scene The ""French fry commercial"" scene<br/><br/>and much more. <br/><br/>This film was hilarious and those who haven't checked it out, do so now!"
"policy134","7","1","2","15 October 2012"," Pretty decent reboot/continuation or sequel
","It probably falls flat as straight out parody because there are a few scenes that really borders on syrupy melodrama, but for what it's worth, you do get quite a few good chuckles out of this slick send-up.<br/><br/>If there are still people who remember what the original show was about, and there are, the series was pretty much a straight drama. It is therefore refreshing that this is mainly comedic.<br/><br/>I will say that I am not a fan of Jonah Hill, and since his name is pretty much all over this (exec producer, writer, star), I will have to blame him for the movie's shortcomings, which are few, but still counts as not recommending the show flat out. Take for example a character played by The Office star, Ellie Kemper. I didn't laugh. Another is one of the main villains, who should have been funny, but just feels annoyingly like a character commenting on the clichés. It should have been funny but again falls flat.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the more inexperienced actors save the day. The kid brother of James Franco is exactly right as to what his character is supposed to represent and it's a nice twist that he represents everything that is uncool to the jock cop, Channing Tatum. As for Channing Tatum, it's odd how much he looks like both Tommy Lee Jones and a little bit Heath Ledger. He is the straight man, so he doesn't really get to strut any stuff, except for a crucial scene somewhere in the middle. He will probably be the next big movie star.<br/><br/>So, it offers a few laughs but even though it's a bit long, it curiously has an unsatisfying ending, possibly because they are already cooking up a sequel. The story is also a bit old hat, but all in all, pretty enjoyable.<br/><br/>By the way, the cameos are at least hilarious."

There are lots of special jokes and the jokes are really so funny and cleverly. They made me laugh a lot. The drug scenes are really funny and the screenwriters of 21 Jump Street worked too tidy. In my opinion there is not a mistake about scenario. The actors did a great job and the story of movie was a well-planned.

Liked the contrast between high school then and now. As with most of today's successful comedies the crudeness is to be expected but I think it relied more on crudeness during the middle to end. Loses a bit of steam in the middle.<br/><br/>Channing is right for his role as the dumb popular guy. Jonah is alright too though not that funny as I would have expected in parts. Cute cameos. The directing is a bit rushed around the jokes themselves and some are lost in the speed.<br/><br/>Overall worth a watch."
"jantoniou","7","1","2","9 August 2012"," Scatological cinema at its finest
","""21 Jump St,"" based - very loosely - on the original series that made the universe and girls the world over aware of Johnny Depp, is a movie that approximately balances genuine low-brow humor with genuine scatology. <br/><br/>Several times I caught myself doubling over in laughter; at least as equal were the number of times I was groaning and practically looking away from the screen in shame and embarrassment that I had just sat through something this crass, crude, and utterly shameless. <br/><br/>Unless you're in a group of bong-hitting, backwards-cap-wearing frat boys - more or less the intended demographic of movies like ""21 Jump Street,"" ""The Hangover,"" and ""Old School"" - be cautious about who you share this masterpiece with. You might both be permanently damaged. This is not for kids, for sure. <br/><br/>That said, are the good laughs worth the frequent trips to toilet humor? Probably. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (is that a Southern thing? I cannot figure who would ever name their child Channing; that sounds like the name of a Southern gentleman who should be sipping mint juleps on their plantation house porch) are both good and up to the task. Tatum pulls off comedy very well. Hill is basically playing the kind of role you expect him to play - i.e., anything he's played in the Apatow movies is very similar. <br/><br/>The plot is somewhat insignificant: The ""21 Jump St"" undercover cop duo of Tatum and Hill (could be a singing a duo, couldn't it?) go undercover in a high school to take down a drug ring. In a twist, Hill, who was supposed to play an undercover geek and Tatum, who was supposed to be the ""cool kid/jock"" - just as it was originally in high school - get accidentally switched and Hill ends up as the popular guy and Tatum - well, not so much. <br/><br/>So... enjoy this for the occasional laugh and just skip it for about everything else."

"parallel_projection","7","1","2","7 August 2012"," Unexpectedly Entertaining
","I went into this movie thinking it was going to be your average, somewhat stupid yet mildly decent teem comedy, but what pleasantly surprised. This movie was actually pretty good--I was definitely entertained, and found myself laughing a lot. There are numerous reasons this movie is better than most of today's similar comedies, some of which include:<br/><br/>1. There are some genuinely funny moments that aren't the usual crude teen jokes. Some of the lines are great, and the ways which the characters handle certain situations is sometimes comical.<br/><br/>2. The acting was really good, especially Jonah Hill and, for what little screen time he had, Johnny Depp. Hill and Tatum, who I generally don't care for, worked well together, and the constantly changing dynamic between them was one of the best parts of the movie.<br/><br/>3. This movie parodies a lot of common misconceptions about movies and life in general. For instance, upon becoming cops, Hill and Tatum are saying how awesome it's going to be to chase down bad guys and jump over cars, etc., and then they are immediately shown on bicycles patrolling a park. Also, on numerous occasions, incidents happened that, in your average movie, would've lead to an explosion, but in the real world, wouldn't have. The characters kept expecting these to explode, and were disappointed when they didn't, but it was comical. (And don't worry, there are plenty of explosions anyways.)<br/><br/>The only real complaint I have is how they handled Johnny Depps cameo. He finally reveals himself after all that time, only to be shot to death along with his partner minutes later. Albeit, he saved Hill and Tatum, and it is definitely a turning point in the film, but now his character line ends, which is kind of disappointing.<br/><br/>Despite this, though, 21 Jump Street was highly entertaining, incredibly funny, and definitely worth seeing."

I suspected to get a cheap laugh,  which i don't mind, but i was surprised by the originality despite of the fact there are a lot of buddy cop movies.  It is a combination of Bad Boys, the Hangover and some feel good moments here and there. <br/><br/>The plot is good and has some nice twists. Both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum put down a solid performance. I find it hard to judge actors in a comedy, but both contribute to the laughs i had. There was a certain chemistry between the extremes they represented.  <br/><br/>If you want some good laughs and a fun and original plot, then 21 Jump Street is a must see."

","Though the second one is a bit of a guess, since I have never seen any episode of the original TV Series. But this one is really trying to do something new. With the same name (or title if you will), but with a really hard R rating. Not sure if there will be an unrated version, but I guess they'll do that too. Even so, the movie was successful enough to warrant us a sequel. I doubt that Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum would be up for a TV show.<br/><br/>Then again, they could replace them or bring new characters into it and make a running series out of it. Question would be, what TV channel they'd go? HBO or something similar or the PG route? But that's speculating, back to this movie, that might have been another reason GI Joe 2 got pushed back. Channing Tatum seems to be on a hot streak right now. His female and male(?) fans would say it's long overdue I guess. But he pairs up good with Jonah Hill and they work great together."

I tried to hold back but after about 10 minutes in, couldn't stop laughing. Both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum outdid themselves as the 2 totally immature undercover cops with things to prove from their own high school days and no clue how to do it.<br/><br/>The understated facial expressions, comic timing and on screen rapport was excellent but looked effortless. Thanks to the writing of Jonah Hill and the production skills of the two main actors; this is a new genre of movie making...not quite spoof but in that region with a lashing of hardcore realism albeit tongue in cheek. I'm so glad Channing Tatum has done something other than the slushy romantic roles he was beginning to get typecast into because he's a brilliant comic actor. The script was excellent; Ice Cube's straight faced boot camp lines cracked me up and the plot and action were pretty good too. Watch out for their drug scene I LMFAO. and a surprise Johnny Depp cameo. If you were a fan of the Police Squad movie s and want an upgrade then this is for you... Pure genius!"

The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is astonishing, surprising, and enjoyable to watch. Hill seems back in comedic form, and it was fascinating to watch Tatum be something more than a 1 dimensional card-board cut out. Amazingly, Tatum carries just as much of the comedic load in this film as Hill.

"brighambartol","6","1","2","20 May 2012"," A somewhat happy medium between a gross-out and a classic
","Many modern comedies are plagued by a kind of gross-out humour, a sensationalization of the perverse and violent that has teen audiences laughing out of sheer shock. 21 Jump Street leans in this direction, but also has throwback moments to a more classic kind of humour. The movie certainly has its great and clever moments. Going undercover into a modern high school, the two main characters have the situation turned on their heads when it isn't quite what they remembered - and the clash experienced between them and their new peers is hilarious. Yet 21 Jump Street also has its cheap tricks, with a few of those gross-out moments that seem almost out of place. If you don't like the gross-out humour, this movie will still be tolerable, and at times hilarious, although you might find a steep and sudden decline in your enjoyment just before the end. If you love the Hangover-esque sensationally gross comedies, you will enjoy this movie until the end, and hopefully find a little refreshing extra flare. All in all, this movie seemed like a half-hearted attempt to find a medium between two types of comedy, and in that it was a moderate success."

High school stud Jenko (Channing Tatum) and slim shady look-a-like Schmidt (Jonah Hill) are clearly at two extremes on the popularity charts. Jenko who is banned from attending his senior prom due to the drop of his grades is furious. Schmidt himself will not be attending the prom since he isn't able to muster up his manhood to ask a girl out. 7 Years later Jenko and Schmidt run into each other at the police academy, buddies up, graduates and ends up on park duty. Forgetting to read the rights following their first ever hilarious arrest, both of them are reassigned to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who sends them undercover as high school students to bust a new drug; HFS and to bring to justice the supplier. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill who is a well-seasoned actor of comedy and Channing Tatum not so much is the perfect match made in heaven (pardon the cliché) for 21 JUMP STREET. What plays to the greatest benefit of the movie is how amazingly brilliant Tatum turns out to be in comedy. Having turned down the role twice Jonah Hill convinced Tatum in playing Jenko and indeed turns out to be wise career move. When Tatum forgot to read the rights and when questioned by his captain to read it for him, Tatum utters ""You have the right to be an attorney"" simply cracked me up. This brings me to my point of brilliant story telling. The script is immaculately written. Michael Becall and Jonah Hills effort of the story is her strongest suit. It isn't stupid-funny like a spoof, instead it is relevant, realistic and quite appropriate to what goes on around us in the world of crime. Directors Phil Lord & Chris Miller ensures they keep it real. Gimmicks are reduced to a bare minimum while Lord and Miller stretch the talents of the actors, writers and themselves to keep the audience laughing. <br/><br/>21 JUMP STREET is a must watch movie. Without any hesitation I recommend this and it will liven up your weekend movie experience. Remember how HANGOVER took you by surprise? How it redefined comedy and the way it's done? Likewise 21 JUMP STREET may be the funniest movie this summer!<br/><br/>TITLE: 21 JUMP STREET DIRECTED BY: PHIL LORD AND MILLER STRETCH STARRING: JONAH HILL, CHANNING TATUM & ICE CUBE RATED: R RATING: 08/10 109 MINUTES"

","21 jump street must be on of the funniest films I have seen out of Hollywood in QUITE SOME TIME. Possibly rivaling 'The Hangover' (2009). It doesn't have much of a story line, but is similar to 'The Hangover' in that it is consistently humorous the entire way through. It's the kind of movie that you curl up in front of the TV with a pizza on a Thursday night and watch, effortless laughs continue throughout the movie, having said that it is not everybody's cup of tea. In parts you feel it is somewhat teetering on mediocre. I found it entertaining for what it is, it is no masterpiece but it sure beats a lot of other current ""comedys""."

","You have to do a lot to get me to laugh out loud at a comedic movie. Slapstick, ""stupid"" humor will not tickle my fancy or come anywhere close. Shock value and foul mouthed comedians will not get me to crack a smile. Blonde jokes, white jokes, black jokes, one-liners, gay jokes, and political satire will barely scratch the surface when it comes to comedy. However, 21 Jump Street found a way to my fancy.<br/><br/>Jonah and Channing delivered an outstanding comedic performance. I'm sure many were hesitant to see this one, expecting a flop by Channing. But this was not the case, Jonah was in no way comically superior to Channing. Their chemistry was natural, the kind of chemistry that makes straight men look gay. Happens all the time to Boon, Ol' Garrey, and myself. Its chemistry, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>The writing was well executed with minor adjustments needed to the tasteless cursing and overdone scenes like a shot off limb (the extra limb). There were moments where the movie's cool was about to fizzle, but it jumped write back into sizzle.

","Forget the church and the address. This has little to do with the TV series about undercover cops posing as high school students – other than centering on undercover cops posing as high school students. The premise begins and ends there; the real stuff deals with the unlikely friendship between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum: in 2005 one was a high school nerd, the other a great looking popular jock.<br/><br/>And now it's 2012 and things have really changed. The geeks are cool and Hill fits right in with a group of politically-correct drug dealers who are the culprits, along with a band of rugged bikers, the duo must snare. But this plot thing is secondary to our underdog heroes back in high school, aided by a clever twist involving a name screw-up: Hill takes the easy classes and Tatum, not a smart cookie, joins the chemistry club. Each discover their own clues to find the supplier of a wonder drug with vivid and hilarious side effects – that we experience first hand! <br/><br/>After the hijinks have played out, including a wild house party, a car chase leads to a Tarantinoeque standoff with guns blazing at the prom (with an important cameo therein). But how the unlikely duo stick together through thick and thin... both gaining a brand new perspective on their former high school experience... is what really works – making for an iconic TV series reboot that, unlike most of its kind, really hits the mark.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

Kids in high school now are nothing like the way they use to be. They seem to be more gadget savvy, smart is the new cool, and hipsters are everywhere..<br/><br/>The cast did look a bit older than most high school kids, but this doesn't draw you away from movie at all. Channing Tatum, and Dave Franco were both excellent in this movie. You can also see how Dave Franco resembles his brother James Franco in his demeanor. <br/><br/>Definitely watch this movie if you get the chance, its targeted towards people in the late 20s, and early 30s. If you're a 21 jumps street fan like me, you won't be disappointed."

","This movie kept me laughing the whole time. I laughed so hard about every 5 minutes of it. Whenever you see Jonah Hill in a comedy, you know he's gonna make you laugh uncontrollably. I don't see Channing Tatum as a goofy, silly actor. I see him as serious and tough. I really didn't expect him to be in a movie like this one. Anyway, they really made this movie a crack up. Those two acting as teenage cops makes me think they know how to take it easy on others who do bad things. Those two reminded me of will Ferrell and mark wahlberg in the other guys. It was weird to me when Jonah was laughing his ass off while having that knife wedged into his back. These two cops sure know how to take bad guys down and know how to party. way to go to them!!! :)"

","I saw an advanced screening of 21 Jump Street this week, and it didn't disappoint. So many clever jokes in such a brisk runtime: you really won't want it to end. The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't insult the audience at all, and is completely showered with brilliant gags and phenomenal writing. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are a completely impeccable duo, and they really need to do more films together. Tatum's true calling is definitely comedy, and Jonah Hill shows off a different side from what we've seen. Dave Franco has been turning in scene- stealing supporting roles for years now, so it's nice to see him have a pretty meaty role in such a comedy. There is also a really bizarre but strangely effective cameo that had the entire audience clapping; the final act is a series of increasingly more hilarious situations that bring all the ideas to their highest peak. I really hope this movie receives the critical acclaim and audience attention it so rightly deserves, because it really is the best comedy of the year so far and it will be pretty much impossible to top it."

","This movie has nothing to do with 21 Jump Street, except to use the title. It's one of those wanna be comedies that uses cussing and perverted jokes to try to be funny. I don't find these type of movies that funny. And this movie was not funny. It was just ridiculous. Showing someone acting silly while taking a deadly drug is just a cheap way to try to get laughs. Sure it is cute when they are on drugs and the teacher's head turns into an ice cream cone, but that is just childish humor.<br/><br/>The only redeeming scene is when Johnny Depp makes his cameo.

"Ramascreen","8","3","13","13 March 2012"," Are you ready for a lifetime of badasses?
","-- www.Ramascreen.com --<br/><br/>I had my doubts about this, because I grew up watching the original series and so the idea for the movie version to go raunchy comedy instead of serious drama, was a bit off-putting at first. But 21 JUMP STREET proves me wrong. Jonah Hill and screenwriter Michael Bacall's sense of humor targets those of us who loved Superbad. And Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller clearly were having a blast with the drug jokes, teen party, and the F-bombs and other juvenile mishaps, the movie is filled with one relevant pop culture reference after another. 21 JUMP STREET may not be consistently funny but it has all the elements of an exciting buddy cop comedy. And the surprise cameos by some of the notable faces from the original series, (SPOILER ALERT) Holly Robinson Pete, Peter DeLouise, and Johnny Depp make the movie all the more special <br/><br/>The original series 21 JUMP STREET was basically about undercover cops handling youth crime, plain and simple, I remember it being a character driven story. The movie, though R-rated comedy, does a damn good job to respect that. It seems as if Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's characters find themselves in the same division that Depp and the gang used to work in back in the '80s but times have changed now, leadership has changed, even the hierarchy and what's considered cool and not cool in high schools have changed.<br/><br/>2 people from different backgrounds, one's a jock, the other is a nerd, are forced to become friends in the Police Academy when they discover that they could progress if they'd just help each other out. They think being cops are being 24/7 badasses everyday, little do they know that most of the duties require patrolling and paperwork and routines, things that they don't care too much for. 21 JUMP STREET's comedy plays on stereotype but not in a mean, tasteless way, it's more playful and like a wink and a nudge. The jock, played by Tatum, is a handsome devil but an airhead. The nerd, played by Hill, is a bit heavy and insecure. The perfect odd couple. The comedy could get outrageous, it's got different steps or levels of drug effects and some of the scenes do drag a bit, the investigation is not too complex, but the script is surprisingly well-structured, I said surprisingly because I was just expecting the worst. Both the jock and the nerd finally get themselves to tap into a side of themselves they never knew they had all along.<br/><br/>If you don't think Hill deserved his Oscar nod for Moneyball, you'd think twice before making that argument the next time, because the dude is hella talented, he's a young actor who responds to his role positively no matter how dumb the role would require him to behave. Tatum's comedic timing comes with him being able to confidently stand in the middle of confusion and awkwardness, he probably channels some of that from being considered a hunk by ladies in real life on a daily basis. Ice Cube as the loud, hot-head Lieutenant is a treat to watch, the same goes for Brie Larson who I'm betting will surely but slowly become the next starlet, you just wait and see. The movie pays homage to the series, it doesn't disrespect it at all, in fact, the cameos by the original stars serve as a way for them to say goodbye to their old roles and pass the torch on to Hill and Tatum; to wish them well. This is one comedy that gets me hoping for a sequel <br/><br/>-- www.Ramascreen.com --"

","Throughout the years, Hollywood has always adapted classic television shows from the 80s, and landed them on film. Now, someone has decided to adapt Johnny Depp's television crime drama ""21 Jump Street"", and turn it into a hilarious comedy. That's not a good decision, but for some reason, it actually worked. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum both deliver a hilarious ""bro-mance"" chemistry as two former high school enemies, who become friends after being reunited at a police academy. After not remembering the Miranda rights, when trying to arrest their first criminal, they are transferred to a revised police program from the 80s on 21 Jump Street, where their mission is to go undercover as high school students, to take down a drug ring happening at the exact same school that these two guys used to go to, and now all hell breaks loose. Someone must need to hunt this movie down because ""21 Jump Street"" is the funniest movie of the year so far. A well-written script, a hilarious cast, and a fresh storyline can help make a perfect comedy. This is a crisp, original, and hilarious ""fun ride"" of a movie! Jonah Hill proves that he is a fresh comedian, and it will help him lead into more funnier projects soon. Channing Tatum may not be a good actor in a action or drama flicks, but he is better as a focused and funny comedian. Watching these two guys as buddies is quite perfect, and everyone immediately buys the fact that they become friends. We also get some hilarious performances from Rob Riggle as a creepy high school coach, Ellie Kemper as a chemistry teacher whose sexually attracted to Channing Tatum, and Ice Cube in a hilarious performance as the boss of 21 Jump Street. Brie Larson plays a teen school girl that Jonah Hill suddenly falls in love with. Even though it sounds a little wrong, the audience immediately buys their chemistry, and you want them to be together. The only disappointing character came from James Franco's brother, Dave Franco, who delivers a weak villain, and he was sort of miscast. Not to mention that this guy is also ridiculously annoying. The rest of ""21 Jump Street"" is downright perfect in every sense possible. Throughout the entire movie, I laughed my ass off, like I've never laughed before. This movie kept going and going with great jokes, and it's still hilarious. They make you want to jump in your seat, and they make you leave the theater pumped up with so much energy. Also, Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise, the stars of the original television show, make a cameo appearance, and it's just plain funny. Why wouldn't that be funny? Also, I also liked the heart of this movie, and how it affects you in some way. When you mix together comedy, action, and a good heart, there's your comedy! But what really impressed me the most is that this film makes fun of the usual ""cop movie"" clichés, flips them around, and brings something new out of them. It is completely self-aware of itself, which makes the comedy aspect so much better. So, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, and I would buy this movie on DVD or Blu-Ray. Trust me, this movie is totally worth your money! ""21 Jump Street"", in my review, ""laugh-out-loud hilarious, a blast-out party""."
"SlackerRus2000","8","2","9","16 March 2012"," A smarter movie than it needed to be, works on multiple levels.
","21 Jump Street is one-part gross-out comedy flick, one-part satire of buddy comedy tropes, and one-part introspective look on the nature of high school, and it all works.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely smarter than it needed to be (and maybe more than it's audience deserves?). For the masses, the gross-out humor will be worth the price of admission alone. I am not above gross-out humor myself, so chin-chin. But, for the high-brow among us, and you know who you are, the jokes making fun of the ludicrous nature of these films and Hollywood will definitely appeal to you too. It doesn't pull any punches and there are jokes that work on multiple levels. The car chase, about two-thirds through the movie, might be one of the best car chase scenes in Hollywood history, if only for it satirical nature.<br/><br/>Besides being comedic gold, there is a suitable story that unfolds during the film. Several themes play out during the film and it can be both touching and deftly played by the actors. There is also a few choice surprise moments that, if you go in a fan of the show it's based off of, will entertain you.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street works on so many levels that it can't help but being a crowd pleaser. The best comedy I have seen in a while and easily the smartest."

It's an unsubtle dig at Hollywood's fascination with remaking old T.V. shows, but it highlights the movie's tongue-in-cheek intent loud and clear: to take a cherished part of America's television history and make it bloody hilarious. It succeeds. Not only do the gags (a fantastic blend of self-referential humour, physical comedy and witty one-liners – all often vulgar and truly earning its MA15+ rating) come thick and fast, but they hit more often than not, and those that fall flat are quickly forgotten such is the rapid rate of jokes. Hill (who also co-wrote) and Tatum prove to be a fantastic mismatch too, with the latter especially impressing in his first fully-fledged comedy role. 21 Jump Street is the funniest flick of 2012 so far."

However I emerged at the end feeling more than pleasantly surprised with what turned out to be a fun, fresh and hilarious buddy-cop movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. <br/><br/>Once natural enemies in high school, jock Jenko (Channing Tatum) and nerd Schmidt (Jonah Hill) find themselves together in police academy and decide to form a mutually beneficial relationship in order to pass their exams. It's the classic exchange, Jenko needs Schmidt's brains and Schmidt needs help in the physical department. Upon graduating, the pair make a spectacular cock up of their first arrest and consequently land themselves in the 21 Jump Street programme. For those who have heard anything about the TV show will know that the programme specialises in young looking cops going undercover to unearth youth crime in high schools and the like. The pair are understandably critical of their new posts (who wants to go through high school more than once?) and the film is humorously self-referential making fun of itself when the operations' leader (Ice Cube) rants that the unit is a just rehashed plan from the 80′s because the higher ups couldn't come up with anything better.

"zkonedog","3","1","3","9 March 2017"," A Genre (And Character) That Is Slowly Dying
","There are some parts of ""21 Jump Street"" that are funny. The trouble is, they are all very predictable and evidence that this genre of film (begun by ""Superbad"") may be beginning to die.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film sees two rookie cops given an undercover assignment back in their old high school. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the high school loser now turned cooler, while Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the high-profile jock who now has trouble reclaiming that identity.<br/><br/>Like I said, there are a few genuinely funny moments in this movie. Unfortunately, they are very few and far between. This type of comedy has been made so many times that it is almost as if the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that Jonah Hill's ""trying to escape adolescence"" character might be starting to wear thin after a number of similar flicks. In all fairness, he does provide probably the funniest gags of the film, but it just isn't quite as funny as it used to be.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there is Channing Tatum. Women will likely give this film a full star higher rating just by looking at his sculpted physique. Men, on the other hand, will probably be more likely to recognize how wooden he can be at times. He isn't a total loss, but he won't be nominated for any Academy Awards anytime soon.<br/><br/>Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" is the typical crude, profane, & stupid comedy seen a million times since ""Superbad"" had such great success. That genre is (or at least should be) on its way out."

Sure I got a couple of laughs but honestly I found most of it silly; following two bumbling, youthful cops who go undercover at a local high school and essentially get to right their wrongs and be teenagers again while they investigate a drug ring.<br/><br/>My favorite scene had to be Johnny Depp's short 'lived' cameo and I did laugh at the idea of two grown men living at home again, having to do chores before they go on their big drug bust.

"zydzik-adam","9","1","3","25 September 2014"," One of the best action-comedy movies of the last decade
","Action and humor are not stuck on the street during the movie 21 Jump Street; they jump off the screen and come alive for millions to see. Jenko, an athletic, seemingly unintelligent police officer played by actor Channing Tatum, and Schmidt, a brainy, socially awkward policeman played by actor Jonah Hill, must relive their traumatic high school pasts as part of the revived Jump Street unit. As members in the unit, they must go undercover together as high school students in order to stop the spread of a brand new synthetic drug. The carefully balanced action and comedic moments, brought alive by the radiating chemistry between actors Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, combine with an underlying layer of friendship and brotherhood to help mold 21 Jump Street into one of the best action-comedy movies of the last decade. <br/><br/>The tight-rope balancing act between action and comedy is well executed in the film. The directing and production team throws unexpected moments into the action scenes, such as nothing seemingly being able to blow up during the car chase scenes when one would normally expect it to, in order to keep the viewers guessing. When the action starts feeling unoriginal, the script interjects a shot of original humor to capture the audience once again. The writers' lack of fear in using supporting characters to point out unrealistic lapses of realism in their own plot, like Tatum and Hill actually being able to pass as high school students, provides some of these consistent jolts of comedic originality. Likewise, the camera focuses on one of Hill's many brilliant facial expressions—such as the one he has when he realizes he has to take the very drug he is trying to rid the school of—to physically show comedy rather than say it through dialogue. This visual comedy effectively balances instances when the film becomes too action heavy. <br/><br/>Hill and Tatum's ability to quickly bounce jokes off of one another ensures that no scene is wasted. Situations where the two actors are able to have their characters finish each other's sentences—like when Jenko is talking to the motorcycle gang at the start of the film and Schmidt picks up right where he leaves off without any interruption—captures the way everything flows when Hill and Tatum are on screen together. This special quality to 21 Jump Street leaves the audience wanting more witty back-and- forth dialogue out of the two actors, creating a similar effect as the smooth, buttery taste of one kernel of popcorn leaving people wanting more. <br/><br/>Laying underneath the main element of comedy that is prevalent in the film is the development of friendship and brotherhood that builds as the movie goes on. While Jenko and Schmidt seem like they will have trouble simply being fake brothers in their undercover unit, the writers succeed in developing the characters to the point where Jenko selflessly is willing to take a bullet for Schmidt and Jenko is able to trust in Schmidt's shooting ability to get them out of a potential jam. This layer displays the writers' ability to craft a well-rounded, well-developed film where the two are able to call each other a true friend and brother outside of the operation.<br/><br/>Besides delivering action-comedy gold, 21 Jump Street displays an interesting dynamic between two people with polar opposite looks. Sometimes the vibe of society today tells us to quickly write someone off solely based on their outer appearance. This film shows that two people like Jenko and Schmidt who initially seem like they will never click or gel can turn out to have more in common with each other than they have with anyone else. 21 Jump Street showcases the importance of not being too quick to judge a person based on their appearance. After all, you never know who you will form that sibling-like bond with in the end."

","I'll give them an extra star for trying, but this is the worst movie I have seen this summer. Not funny, lots of unnecessary profanity in the name of comedy, sub par acting and a vanilla pudding script and plot. I had expected more from the two main actors but they did not deliver. It was even a waste of the $3 I spent going to the matinée. I know this was to be some sort of comedic parody on the original made for TV drama 21 Jump Street. However, even in that fashion it is a complete flop. C Tatum is a decent actor and seems really out of place in this movie. His sidekick however does belong in this movie. His sidekick(partner) being unattractive, overweight and basically I wonder how he even made it in Hollywood. His folks must be rich and bribed a Producer along the way so he could make it to this film. Whatever the reason, he is certainly not a comedian. To be honest, C Tatum is not a good comedian either and that is just one more reason this movie part is out of place for him, and consequently his performance is lackluster. I give it 2 stars, and I am being generous."

","21 Jump Street is apparently something of a remake of the 1987 TV series starring Johnny Depp and Dustin Nguyen (it's a couple of years before my time so I haven't seen it yet to compare the two) which features underachieving policemen Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) who are assigned the task of posing as high school students in an undercover operation to bring down a drugs ring, leading the pair into a whole host of hilarious situations.<br/><br/>Despite the juvenile nature that you'd typically expect from this film (not normally something I particularly enjoy) I thought this film was hilarious. Some of the jokes were very base but these were fairly outnumbered by some genuine good humour. Of course the whole film borders on the silly and far-fetched throughout but it never pretends to be anything other than just that, and rarely feels like it's trying too hard for audience laughs. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are a dream comedy duo in this: their differences in acting styles and personalities are played up in stereotypes which make for some real fun, especially as the stereotypical American high school is a strong factor. Dave Franco plays the shifty popular kid and offers an enjoyable performance that occasionally stands up to the humour of Tatum and Hill, although the biggest laughs from a more minor character come from Ice Cube, the exasperated chief at the 21 Jump Street Facility. There's a nice cameo appearance from the original 21 Jump Street-ers Johhny Depp and Dustin Nguyen too.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a brilliantly funny comedy that's full of light- hearted silliness then it doesn't get much funnier than this. Despite being a little apprehensive I absolutely cracked up at this film and can't wait to see if the sequel lives up to the laugh out loud humour in this."

","Comedy can be brought into fame due to a couple that interact with each other in a comical way. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are that couple in '21 Jump Street.' The two star as cops who are assigned to go undercover at a high school to get a drug bust. The mission isn't so smooth as they face their hilarious struggles and meet bizarre people like the gym teacher and certain students. The comedy in this film comes from the rambunctious activity these two men pursue. They swear their heads off, party, say hilarious stuff, and do a pretty terrible job at giving justice a name. Jonah Hill is a nerdy, awkward guy who isn't so good at being street smart or physically capable at being a cop, but instead as other strengths such as blending in or managing stress. Channing Tatum is more the street smart kick-ass character. Together they create a dynamic-duo that will crack you up for days. Many lines the two guys have are hilarious, but its more the spoofing of themselves that really stand out. The melodramatic scenes in which their identifications are almost revealed provide mayhem in a comedic way as well. Popcorn comedy films provide the perfect sense of joy, and when their are two genies comedians doing their funniest work yet in an awesome plot, you have comedy gold."

","I did not expect much from this film, I watched it only because it had Jonah Hill in it and this movie made me LOVE him even more.<br/><br/>The story line is plausible, and really depicts the experience of high school adolescents. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum were exceptional actors in this film, some of the scenes I was wondering how on earth they are not laughing their heads off. Some of the dialogue was amazing, I found myself in fits of giggles throughout.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film was when the duo were together, they really fed off each others personas.

"brunettewarrior","Null","1","3","30 November 2013"," Unexpectedly funny
","I decided to watch 21 Jump Street on a whim and because I like the lead actors, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. I didn't go into it expecting to laugh or find it funny, because honestly, most comedies don't make me laugh anymore. That being said, this comedy made me laugh at things I didn't know I would find funny.<br/><br/>If you were to play a drinking game or something during this movie, the word to take a sip during would be ""dick."" I have to admit, I didn't really care for the overuse of ""suck my dick,"" and all the dick humor. Constructive criticism: half of those should have been cut. That being said, a few times they used it in appropriate situations, and I laughed. <br/><br/>One thing that I noticed was how the high school students seemed to be highly influenced by Tumblr. I kept thinking how each kid seemed to be a stereotype of a tumblr user. I find tumblr users to be simultaneously mature and immature for their age, and I found the characters to be a little too ironic. However, for comedic purposes, it seems to have worked. <br/><br/>It was a nice introduction for me to Dave Franco. He, of course, reminds me exactly of his brother. I wonder if James Franco will be in the sequel- it would seem to fit the formula. I like Brie Larson in everything I see her in, and she doesn't seem to be overly-exposed like Jennifer Lawrence. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie fit the bill for a lazy Saturday afternoon. Thanks for the laughs and witty one liners!"

","I did not see this one coming at all, but 21 Jump Street happens to be a very funny action film with some spot-on acting, some crazy jokes, good action sequences, and a beloved source material. When I first heard that they were going to remake this, I was not happy. But this is possibly the best way to remake it. Some jokes may be tasteless, but they are pretty darn funny. The film also deliver the thrills with some high-speed car chases and fiery shootouts.<br/><br/>Phil Lord and Chris Miller's film is about two fresh-faced cops named Schmidt and Jenko who are forced to go undercover at a high school to prevent the outbreak of a new, devastating drug.<br/><br/>The acting is way better than anyone could have hoped for. Channing Tatum is starting to get on my good side and he was very good here. He and Jonah Hill are very likable and have outstanding chemistry. However, Ice Cube stole the show. He has some very memorable one-liners and they still crack me up just thinking about them.<br/><br/>Overall, this a totally unexpected surprise. I was not expecting much out of this, but I got a better film than most people realized. I'm so happy they were able to pull the film off. I guess they left a few surprises in here which pleased most people. I also like how I felt nostalgia because I was able to relive my high school moments all over again. I rate this film 9/10."

","When i first saw the trailer for 21 Jump Street (after watching Jonah Hill's The Babysitter) i thought this was another piece of comedy garbage. But after what i have heard from some of my friends at school my curiosity spiked. Then I found the movie on Stars on Demand and decided to watch it. Boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>The beginning was up-beat and had a heartfelt tone (sorry no spoilers you're going to have to watch it to understand what I mean.) So right away your attention is grabbed! I have never had a movie where i've fallen in love within the first few minutes. I like how Jenko (Tatum) and Schmditt (Hill) have a great chemistry throughout the film, especially when both characters swap the roles of jock and nerd (again, this is not a spoiler this was included in the preview/trailer/premise of 21 Jump Street.) Which as one might expect, would have a lot of hilarious results. And near the end...die hard 21 Jump Street fans of the original may get a bit of a surprise ;). <br/><br/>So overall, I give this movie a 9/10 for great chemistry, hilarious plot, great acting. However the only thing i would like is to see more of Ice Cube's role as the black captain, because this movie has really improved Ice Cube as an actor (watch Ice's last few movies to see what I mean.)"

","""21 Jump Street"" is basically a dumb movie, and knows exactly what kind of movie it is. It makes no pretense about being silly. I understand that it's based on a TV series starring Johnny Depp, although I've never seen the series. Taking the movie on its own, one can't deny that it's nice, brainless entertainment. You can tell that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are taking a lot of pleasure in their roles as cops having to pose as high school students to stop some drug dealers. Without a doubt the best scene is the Peter Pan scene; that must've been so much fun to film! <br/><br/>Yes, it's almost all low humor, especially a scene towards the end. You just gotta love the scenes in which characters get high. The whole movie is just a lot of fun. I think that you'll like it."

","I had always heard about the 1980's television show that made Johnny Depp a star and a teen idol (which he got annoyed by), and it was interesting to hear that they were making a film based on it, I had no idea about the plot of the show, so it would be interesting to see the film portray it. Basically Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) who was a nerd and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) who was a jock were formerly classmates in the same school, and only met again at police academy, and becoming friends they graduate as partners, but are assigned to park patrol, and trying to catch drug dealers and their leader Domingo (DeRay Davis) they are reassigned and the criminal is released because his rights were not given correctly. They are put in the specialty division that is revived together, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) explains that it involves police officers who look youthful working undercover in a school, and they go to 21 Jump Street to do so, as a synthetic drug is spreading around and their job is catch the supplier. Their new identities are as brothers Doug and Brad McQuaid, living at Schmidt's parents' house, but their identities are accidentally switched and get each other's classes, but eventually they track down lead dealer Eric Molson (Dave Franco) who is giving out the drugs, but he is not the supplier and has no idea who that is. Eric is suspicious of the two cops, thinking they are older than they seem, and he forces them to take a sample of the drug right in front of him, and after leaving they unsuccessfully try to throw it up, and both of them go through the phases of the drug in front of the other students during classes. Both of them do eventually settle into their student roles, Schmidt fitting in with the popular youngsters and gaining a romantic interest with Eric's friend Molly Tracey (Brie Larson), and Jenko gaining nerdy friends in chemistry class and teacher Ms. Griggs (Ellie Kemper) finding him sexually attractive, and gain the complete trust of Eric they throw a house party, ignoring orders from Captain Dickson not to serve alcohol and drugs to the minors. They do manage to steal of cell phone which can be tapped if any calls come from the supplier of the drugs, and prom is approaching so Schmidt and Jenko are getting dates and suits ready for the night, but this is halted when they find out who Eric has been dealing with, it is Domingo and his gang, and they end up in a big chase when spotted. The two of them get into a bad argument about school and case stuff, and they end up expelled from the school and fired from the police and Jump Street, but before leaving they do get inside information from Eric that a drug deal will happen during the night of the prom, and that Domingo will meet with the supplier, so they continue to get ready to solve the case. Prom night comes, and they are surprised to see that physical education teacher Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle) is the supplier, then Domingo arrives and recognises the police officers, two of his take them out and are told to kill them, but they let them go and take off disguises to reveal themselves as DEA Agents Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise, Dom's son) who were part of the Jump Street program themselves when they began. Domingo gets the opportunity and kills Hanson and Penhall, and a gunfight ensues with the other two officers, being chased in a limo Jenko creates a homemade bomb to kill the gangster and his crew, and he also saves Schmidt when Mr. Walters attempts to shoot him,l the end sees Schmidt and Jenko correctly give the rights and congratulated by Dickson, Schmidt shares a kiss with Molly, and they are given a new college set assignment. Also starring Nick Offerman as Deputy Chief Hardy and Jake Johnson as Principal Dadier. Hill and Tatum are a reasonably good twosome as the often slow-witted and uncoordinated police officers who may be grown up but actually suit their younger identity changes, it was good for Depp to make a quick and unexpected cameo as well, I read that the story is not completely similar to that of the TV show, but it didn't matter to me, I got the gist of it, and it did have some funny moments, especially joking about television conventions and adolescent behaviours, the guns and bombs going on are quite fun too, a not bad action comedy. Worth watching!"

","Just watched this last night, when i saw how long it was my first thought was that this is way to long for an ""action/comedy"" movie and, i was right. That's not to say the movie was bad (i gave it a 6 after all), it's just that films in the action comedy genre tend to over run, for me an ideal length for this type of movie is 80mins maybe 90mins max, as the comedy aspect always tends to wear thin after about the hour mark, it's very hard sustain. I thought the 2 main characters were well cast, and i do like movies with Jonah Hill in them, the story was OK, though nothing really different, an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** The movie was starting to drag towards the end but an excellent cameo by Johnny Depp was a stand out moment in the film and regained my interest immediately, without that appearance this would have been a 5 rating from me at best."
"amahlanand","9","1","3","2 June 2012"," Buddy-Teen Comedy Brilliance
","I think we've seen the pioneering of a new sub-genre: a merger between a buddy cop and teen comedy film. Who isn't constantly on the hunt for something different? The filmmakers made it clear that they were keen to establish a gulf between the television series and the feature film; indeed, the film takes no more but the fundamental concept and premise from the series and laces it with almost slapstick, though mature hilarity which makes for one of the comedy spectacles of 2012. <br/><br/>The story is definitely stupid but it's made to be that way. That was the storywriters' intentions, one of which was Jonah Hill himself. It's supposed to be exaggerated and have a silly, immature teen, high school wrongdoing element to it. It was like an 'American Pie' meets crime drama. For those raising their eyebrows, I did mention it was unique. Strange the way I describe it but take my word for it, it works superbly. <br/><br/>The sense of humour is very juvenile and far from sophisticated. Any comedy associated with Jonah Hill means that you would be fooling yourself if you expected more refined laughs. I wouldn't say that this would have broad appeal, not least of all for loyal fanatics of the television show who may get the inch that all Tatum and Hill do is slander the '21 Jump Street' name. Hopefully, Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise's involvement will prevent that. All the same, it's raunchy, occasionally crude but brilliantly thought out with acting that works. <br/><br/>On the note of acting, we do see some typecasting to some extent: Tatum in his stereotypical dimwitted, jock role and Hill in his overdone 'nerd punching above his weight' type role. They form an unlikely, almost unnatural duo representing the yin to each other's yang. Yet, they really surprise you with their fantastic, humorous chemistry; I wouldn't hesitate in saying that I would eagerly anticipate a follow-up with this pair in the hot seat. It's a credit to Channing Tatum that he really took the initiative and showed greater acting prowess in this clichéd role than we have seen from him. Jonah Hill is his usual self although sporting a new, streamlined look. That doesn't change the fact that he is becoming a comedian I would assume is beginning to attract a loyal fanbase. A special mention also needs to be shouted out to Ice Cube who returns to his element with an array of 'Ice Cube moments' which could only be criticised for brevity. <br/><br/>This film is really a hoot, you'll derive some great hilarity from it. Don't however make the mistake of thinking you are seeing the next 'Lethal Weapon' or 'Rush Hour' as much as a derivative of 'The Other Guys' or 'Starsky and Hutch'. And don't watch it for any sort of intricate crime solving or spectacular action. Do however watch it for some juvenile pleasure."

It really didn't even need to be called 21 Jump street, it could have stood on it's own but kinda glad they did so I could see all those cameos from the originals :) That was fun!

"FSfilmblog","9","1","3","19 May 2012"," unexpectedly funny!
","First off, I don't normally go for comedies but as I find myself in LA waiting for a flight departing in 8 hrs I had a plenty of time on my hands. Went off to the local multiplex and found not much on, my choices were The Lorax, John Carter, 21 Jump Street amongst others. So I opted for what I thought was the best of a bad bunch and went to see 21 Jump Street.<br/><br/>I had little knowledge of this film only that it is a update of an old TV show from the 80s and that it now follows more of a comedic route than it's origins. It stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as two young high school kids from the opposite spectrum of the popularity scale. Schmidt (Hill) is a geek who doesn't get to go to prom and is ridiculed by his fellow students whereas Jenko (Tatum) is the typical high school jock who is popular with everyone and believes he will be crowned the prom king until he finds he's is unable to attend due to his poor grades. So far so predictable.<br/><br/>After graduation, they both enrol in the police force and Jenko spots the opportunity to team up with Schmidt to pass the police exam to become fully fledged police officers. They form a friendship and become partners. No plot surprises there, but what does come through is the two leads energy and exuberance. The two stars provide an engaging and very strong performance which I must admit caught me by surprise (especially from Tatum, who knew he could do comedy so well?).<br/><br/>As they bumble through a routine arrest the police force believe their youthful appearance would work well in their special unit called 21 Jump Street. The main directive of this special task force is to infiltrate high schools and tackle a new synthetic drug being dealt to students. They embark on the undercover project and it's here where the majority of the comedy comes about. A mix up occurs and as a result they are forced to pretend to be one another's pre-assigned undercover identities, one an athlete and the other a science nerd and the previous natural roles undertaken in their own teen years are finally broken.<br/><br/>It's safe to say the jokes do come thick and fast and there is many a moment when I found myself laughing out loud. What is surprising about the whole film isn't the actual assignment but the characters chance to relive their high school experiences and their journey to correct past mistakes and in essence play a different role. You begin to care less about the sub-plot of the drug ring they are suppose to smash and become more emotionally involved with the two characters predicament and self discovery.<br/><br/>I can safely say that this film is an absolute blast, which is more hit than miss on the joke front. A film with little in they way of expectations has become a surprise hit as a result. So less said the better (sometimes a film's trailer will give away all it's best moments but there are so many great funny scenes it would be impossible to do this!). I was very impressed by Tatum as I would never have expected him to do so well in a comedy performance and if this was anything to go by, he'll have something else to fall back on if his tough guy action roles dry up."

After watching many great films (including this), I am actually starting to believe that 2012 is a really great year for movies. 21 Jump Street was a very awesome movie with very creative and humorous script. This movie is about 2 guys (cops) and they are accepted in to a ""club"" called 21 jump street. They are assigned to investigate who the drug dealer is and who the supplier is and arrest them. One of the things i really liked about this movie is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. They were both great and really funny in this movie. Surprisingly, I'm going to say Channing was a little funnier than Jonah. But this movie was really really good. It is a really great time in the theaters watching with your friends.

","When I first saw the trailer of 21 Jump Street I kinda had this feeling that there might be something into this movie, even though, I was mostly unimpressed with previous Jonah Hill's movies, but Channing Tatum in a comedy genre made me curious. I was definitely impressed. <br/><br/>I started watching movie just before one of my final exams at Uni just to get the edge off, so I wasn't so much in a ""relaxed"" mood, but this movie made my day. Jokes were funny and even if they were cliché they still looked original and fresh. I think main actors made a great duo between raw awkwardness from Hill and a fresh side and decent effort from Tatum. Rest of the cast was also OK, but the best features of this movie is not the actor play, it's the script, editing and just that feeling you get out from it. It's exactly what comedy should be - making you laugh no matter what.<br/><br/>The plot is easy on the viewer. It contains some drama, some action and , of course, some comedy, but everything is kept light and you can focus on every scene individually. Even if you did not like last hits of comedy like Hangover, Pineapple Express or Superbad, you WILL enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Some people might find the ending a bit off (I guess I did too), but the first 60 minutes were so good and made me laugh so many times, that I was forced to give it 10/10."

For my part, there were times when I had tears rolling down my face. The only reason I give it 9/10 rather than 10 is that I think the standard of humour dropped slightly in the latter part of the film, but that is not to say it wasn't still funny and I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh."

","21 Jump Street (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Reboot of the 80s TV series features Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum playing cops who go undercover in high school to try and discover who's passing around a new drug that has already killed one kid. When there the once dork Hill finds himself popular while the once popular Tatum finds himself with the losers as they try to track the drugs. I will admit that I never watched the original series so I'm not even going to try to compare them but I did find this movie to be hilarious at times and quite often very clever in its attempt to show some homages as well as spoofs. I think the film works so well because the two leads actors are simply so good in their roles. It also doesn't hurt that the two of them can work so well together and can play off one another and really take a joke and run with it. There are some hilarious bits here including a few running scenes with a motorcycle gang, which are just hilarious. Once again it's scenes like these where the screenplay really shows how clever it is because you expect certain things to happen yet they don't and the film can't wink at you for it. I thought the character development was also pretty good for this type of film as both cops really go through some ups and downs and it doesn't add up to melodrama but instead some nice growth for them. Of course, people aren't coming here for drama and thankfully this is left to just a few scenes. The rest of the film is 100% comedy and I'd say for the most part the jokes work. We get some silly laughs, some gross-out humor and just about every other type of humor you can think of. The screenplay goes all out in regards to how it gets the laughs as it really doesn't care how to do it as long as they come. I'd say that a good 80% of the jokes work very well and those that don't still aren't too bad. The one negative thing is that the film goes on way too long as we start to get dragged down in a few too many scenes that are just pushing away the obvious ending. With that said, the movie works extremely well thanks to the two leads but the cameo also works to perfection."

The language was terrible and totally gratuitous, not adding anything to the plot other than for those imbeciles who think swearing is comedy, which is a cheap shot. There was not one good gag in the whole film. When you watch films like this it does one thing; it explains why the present generation acts the way it does and has the low standards that it displays.

","What I found most surprising was how perfect the pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was. It was almost as unusual as the casting in The Other Guys, but this one worked a hell of a lot better. Plus, 21 Jump Street was livelier and funnier throughout, and on those merits alone deserves the 8/10 rating I have given it.<br/><br/>I was also really impressed with Channing Tatum and how well he handled a comedic role, considering his previous work includes Step Up, Dear John and The Vow. He was more prominent in the lead, and stood out more so than Jonah Hill, mainly because he was playing outside of the arena he is accustomed to and our expectations of him were lower, while Hill is primed and natural in this genre.<br/><br/>What comes as no surprise is that Hill would have something to do with a film implementing the whole high-school backdrop, allowing him to revisit past scenarios and recreate some of the fun from Superbad. It was Seth, trimmed down and perm-less, and as awkward and insecure as ever with women, still engaging in endless partying and heavy drinking all in an effort to fit in with the cool crowd. It seems a trend is developing for Hill, and it could threaten to type-cast him. He was pretty damn funny in the movie though, and rightfully earns that kind of praise.<br/><br/>The movie was as humorous as it was morally driven, exhibiting themes of partnership, trust and loyalty, and how defiance and betrayal can break, or threaten to break, a friendship (similar in nature to 2004′s remake of Starsky and Hutch).<br/><br/>21 Jump Street proves that even comedies can have underlying messages and useful lessons for kids ...violence, coarse language and intensively vulgar, inappropriately graphic, sexually explicit themes and dialogue aside.<br/><br/>Oh, and Johnny Depp's cameo is awesome. The way his character's reappearance was written into the story is nothing short of genius."

","Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are seniors in high school in the year 2005. Morton is a nerd and fails to ask a girl out at the prom. Greg is a popular kid who didn't graduate in high school. Seven years later they meet again at the police academy and become friends. Morton and Greg got themselves in trouble after arresting one of the drug dealers, but forgot to memorialize the Miranda Rights. The two are relocated at 21 Jump Street. Their new Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), who is a dick (the name says it all), tells them that some kid overdose some drug that causes them hallucination and radical behavior. Their assignment is to go undercover in high school as teenagers and arrest the supplier before the drugs gets into the wrong hands. <br/><br/>While most fans think that the film is a remake of the 80's hit show, its not. In fact it is a direct sequel of the original show. Some of the original cast is back, but only for a brief amount of time. So does the ""sequel"" works? The answer is yes. What surprises me is how much I enjoy 21 Jump Street. I haven't had a good laugh for a very long time. Usually comedies do not have good plots, but 21 Jump Street works. Sure it's not the best plot ever, but it is good enough for this kind of genre. Jonah Hill is great as usual as a comedian because that's what he's good at, but Channing Tatum caught my attention. Known for his usual romantic type cast characters, he has proved himself that he could be funny as well. There are two things that I did not like about this movie, but it isn't bad at the same time. One is that the action sequence was quite useless because it was poorly directed, but at the same time it was funny to watch. **Spoiler alert** For example, in one scene Morton and Greg are being chase by biker gangs and every time when they take one of the gangs, the bikes ending up crashing into the truck which carries gas tanks, but doesn't explode, however when one of the bikes crash into the truck that carries chickens it explodes. It was pointless, but it was funny at the same time **Spoiler Ends**. Another issue that I had was that the filmmakers were trying to be serious for the last 30 minutes of the film, but it didn't work, but at the same time at least I'll give them credit for trying. <br/><br/>21 Jump Street is one of the best comedies that I've seen in a while.

","21 Jump Street was surprisingly one of the funniest movies I've seen in a couple of years. I was expecting to walk in to the theater and watch another over-advertised comedy with no substance. I don't think I've laughed that hard at a theater in a while. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant. They play the roles perfectly as undercover cops going on a mission as high school students. This was one of Jonah Hill's funniest roles right next to Superbad. I was surprised to find that Channing Tatum actually has a sense of humor and I actually liked his performance. This is another one of those comedies that are acceptable to quote out in public at a certain moment. Definitely should be recognized in the future as a classic. The only thing that I found that I didn't like about the movie was that it was just a little too long towards the end. Yes it was still funny, but just dragged on a little too long."

","There were a couple funny moments in the film, so I'll give it three stars. These guys BREAK so many laws just to arrest the criminals, most of it wasn't even funny. They influence everyone to DO drugs, throw drug parties, and DO drugs themselves. Seems like a police recruitment film on top of that. The fact is, if drugs are Legal, than drug use goes Down. Nobody tries to push it on people then. Also we wouldn't need 80% of the police. Maybe if I was a big fan of the police and the war on drugs with all it's corruption and illegal confiscations, then I'd like this movie more. I just didn't like the idea of destroying everyone's lives with drugs and crime and then laughing about it."

"big_ryan15","7","1","6","18 March 2012"," No respect for the original, but funny all the same....
","Attended a screening of 21 Jump Street last night, wasn't blown away but it was still just as fun and enjoyable as you'd expect something starring Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill as undercover police officers. Firstly, if you can, AVOID ANY AND ALL trailers for this film.... basically every comedic moment from act 1 was covered in these 30 seconds trailers; causing me to already know the jokes and plot points that were upcoming in the next 20-30 minutes. During the set up for act 2, i found it a little hard to get into the story because i felt like id kinda been left out of the loop for that first act. Once you're in though, well you're absolutely in for a fun ride. If you're familiar with Jonah Hill's previous works (previous to Moneyball) you'll understand exactly what you're in for. Channing Tatum was the BIG surprise for me during this film. Not only did he show the audience a completely different (vulnerable,flawwed) spectrum of his acting range, but he was actually funny as hell too, the back and forth banter between Hill & Tatum MADE the movie and is ever so believable. Obviously filmed with an R18+ rating in mind, its a little disappointing as an Australian audience that we were given a watered down MA15+ version of the American cut,although the R18+ version gives me something to look forward to watching when released internationally on DVD and Blu-ray. Watch out for the Johnny Depp cameo in Act 3 too; a nice nod to the original 21 Jump Street TV series that ever so quickly lets the audience know that THAT series is well and truly finished, and that Jonah and Channing ""got this"". No ""Superbad"" or ""Easy A"" but definitely on the same path. Looking forward to the sequel immensely; although what would they call it? 21 Jump Street 2? 22 Jump Street? I guess we'll find out in 2014."
"destroyah25","8","1","6","16 March 2012"," very funny movie
","I will start by saying this movie is hilarious. There were several laugh out loud moments in this movie, and the entire theater was laughing in several parts. The chemistry of Tatum and Hill was completely spot on, and made an excellent team. The overall of the plot was definitely very solid throughout most of the film. Towards the end it kind of let up for a just a little bit, but picked it back up to finish how it should have, which is as funny as it began. Sure there were a few moments here and there that could have been better acted out or written and such. Ultimately though this movie is a comedy, and combines the best of both worlds of some raunchy with excellent slapstick humor. This is a movie I will be seeing again in theaters, and anyone looking to have a good time and just have a laugh this is a must see. I will admit I never saw the original or had any idea what to expect coming in, but am very pleased I saw this film. 8/10"
"tbmforclasstsar","9","1","7","16 March 2012"," an action packed comedy full of lowbrow humor and hilarious performances
","In a list of popular funny men currently working in Hollywood, Jonah Hill would have to rank somewhere pretty high up the list. With ""Knocked Up,"" ""Superbad,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""Funny People,"" and ""Get Him to the Greek"" all under his belt (as well as an Oscar nomination for a serious role in ""Moneyball"") Hill is easily one of the most demanded comedy actors in the business. And he has just added another fantastic film to that resume.<br/><br/>But unlike the previously mentioned films which included another comic actor as either the lead or supporting performer to Hill (Seth Rogen multiple times, Michael Cera, Bill Hader, Jason Segel, Adam Sandler, Russell Brand), his new film, ""21 Jump Street,"" co-stars Channing Tatum. Tatum is more likely to be to be the star of your high school sister's magazine pictures hung up in her locker than the star of one of your favorite movies, but that may have changed with this new flick.<br/><br/>Hill and Tatum team up to play Schmidt and Jenko, two young and unaccomplished police officers who get their chance to finally make a name for themselves when they go undercover in a high school to bust a drug ring. Enrolled in school as brothers Doug and Brad, Schmidt and Jenko find that high school has changed a lot in seven years. When Schmidt and Jenko had originally attended high school, Schmidt was the nerd and Jenko the cool prom king/jock. Now, returning undercover, they have a role reversal when Schmidt's Doug finds tons of popularity with the cool kids and Jenko's Brad struggles to be cool and fit in. This, obviously, brings up a bit of conflict in the relationship of these best friends as Schmidt starts letting his cool label get to his head, but that is just a small part of this film's story.<br/><br/>Created as a film based on a TV series (the 1987 series starring Johnny Depp), the story is more of a new imagining of the series for film than bringing the television series to the big screen. Schmidt and Jenko are all new characters, and the only similarity with the TV series is the premise and a very hilarious cameo. The film is a work of its own, the story written by Hill and Michael Bacall and the screenplay written by Bacall. Bacall is known for his screenplay for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" and you can imagine the style of comedy in ""21 Jump Street"" if you have seen that film. Couple this with the director choices of Phil Lord and Chris Miller who teamed up for ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and TV's ""Clone High,"" and this film was made to succeed.<br/><br/>And succeed it does. ""21 Jump Street"" is the most clever and witty comedy to come to theaters since ""Scott Pilgrim"" or ""The Hangover."" This is a result of a strong series of ingredients that mix together to create something truly memorable and laughable. The writing is quick and witty, the story is fun and designed for hilarious scenarios, the film does not shy away from gross out and mature humor, and, most of all, the chemistry between Hill and Tatum as the two leads is brilliant.<br/><br/>Read the end of the review (IMDb form to short) for ""21 Jump Street"" at http://custodianfilmcritic.com/21-jump-street/"

","The Finishing Touch to Da Smoodie<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is an action packed comedy that manages to keep you on your toes while still making everything ridiculously funny. Directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, executed a well thought out film that had me at the edge of my seat one second and the next I was cracking up with laughter. The film was very easy to understand and follow along with throughout the whole plot. This movie would be perfect to gather up some friends, sit down, and get ready to laugh along with this exciting, comical movie.<br/><br/>The film starts out with both Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) in high school. It is made very obvious that they don't get along but after college they realize they can help each other with their weaknesses and become best friends to pass police training. They are later assigned to go undercover at a nearby high school to find a drug dealer and stop him, but Schmidt starts to get caught up in the popularity he never had in his high school experience. Tension starts between Jenko and Schmidt and they have to relive all the drama they had left behind.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is very spot on in almost all the situations the actors are out through. At one point in the film, Schmidt and Jenko are forced to ingest drugs. Tatum and Hill portray the scene very well and makes the audience think that they are actually on drugs. The emotions displayed by the actors seem to be very sincere and make you feel like you are almost included in the film. It has been known before that both Tatum and Hill are amazing actors considering all the other major roles in movies they have played such as leading roles in Magic Mike, She's the Man, Superbad, and The Wolf of Wall Street. The pair are an unlikely duo but make the movie turn out great with their differences.<br/><br/>The good things in this movie definitely outweigh the bad things. Some things to consider is that it most likely wouldn't appeal to anyone under the age of 17 because of the humor and rating. The film could manage to offend almost anyone if it wasn't taken light heartedly based off of all the crude jokes and slang. Some of the pros of the film were the classic stereotypes of action movies such as having a dramatic explosion, which it did have after the characters joked about the fact that they thought there would be an explosion. The sarcasm and irony of the film really pulls it all together in the end to perfectly mix the drama, action, and comedy in the movie so that one doesn't outweigh the others.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is definitely a movie I could watch over and over again with my friends and still laugh about it, even though I know what is going to happen. It's funny, entertaining, exciting, and overall a people pleaser of a movie. If you're looking for a quality action comedy movie, 21 Jump Street is the perfect movie for you."

"corvidia","3","0","3","22 December 2019"," If you struggle with the premise, it won't redeem itself
","Maybe nobody but the other virtue police, miscellaneous hoodlums, hippies and concerned mothers of the world will care about this, but:<br/><br/>I heard endless good things about this movie but never watched it for a long time because 1) narcs and snitches are not redeemable characters, generally speaking, 2) making a joke of police brutality in this era is in pretty poor taste 3) it's okay to narc out and kill psychedelics dealers who haven't been shown to do anything else illegal. But then again, I think you can make an excellent joke of most things, if you do it right. The trouble is, comedy can be propagandist, it wins people over. So when live animals get blown up for laughs, and the audience laughs along, obviously the whooole audience isn't gonna run out and start blowing up chickens, and if even some people in the audience do, who's responsible? The people who blew up the chickens, not the people who made the movie, ultimately. The whole ""guns don't kill"" argument in a nutshell, right? But even still, the fact that chickens are getting blown up for jokes, green energy guy is evil, the only black people in the movie (except Ice Cube) are either played for laughs as getting punched and being pissy about it or getting shot because they're criminals - shot by cops - is unconscionable. Realistic, yes, but...they're being shown as ""bad guys"" and it's clear we aren't supposed to care or think twice about it. There's no due process, tons of suspects are just getting shot on suspicion of dealing what appear to be psychedelics but are treated like effin bath salts - with the excuse that ""one kid died from psychedelics"". In an era when MDMA and psilocybin are increasingly being found to be extremely useful at mitigating symptoms of depression, schizophrenia, addiction and PTSD among other mental health issues, this fearmongering reinforcement of existing Reagan-era hysterics is in pretty poor taste. A kid could die from tide pods, so should tide dealers be shot without due process? Obvious hyperbole, but nevertheless...<br/><br/>That all being said, the movie gives a fashionable nod to marijuana and booze as being ""okay drugs"", as opposed to coke (which is the of a rather funny joke). The film is super funny, despite the main characters being generally unkind, dimwitted, selfish and lacking in empathy. I must admit that even the mean humor is at times pretty funny, though it's in poor taste. Some things are just so needlessly cruel and stupid that they are shockingly hilarious.<br/><br/>The tertiary and second characters are quite awesome, and the overall view of the world & modern high school culture is weirdly spot on, making it a less stupid comedy than expected. The jokes are on point, the humor cuts to the core of a lot of pretty realistic situations.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the total amorality / very right-wing leaning of the story, I'd give it 7 stars. But there's just no getting around the fact that the better the comedy is, the better the (accidental) propaganda for really low standards for all the high schoolers, college kids, and generally impressionable idiots of all ages watching this and knowing that just spoils it for me, unfortunately. Channing Tatum gets 7 stars for hotness, and but that phone tapping nerd gets 8. Meow."

","He drowns himself in tears and embarrassment because of one reason: a girl rejected his prom-posal. Seven years later, Morton Schmidt, played by Jonah Hill, disguises as an introverted nerd, and Greg Jenko, played by Channing Tatum, disguises as a popular jock. They partner up together in the police force and go undercover at a local high school to stop the flow of a drug chain and a new supplier. 21 Jump Street, directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, pulls the audience into a wild comedy crime film. The public response in 2012 was so impressive that a sequel, 22 Jump Street, was made. Even though 21 Jump Street has a predictable ending, it will always be one of the best movies ever made because of its corny jokes, relatability, and crazy action scenes.
 This film will have you laughing until you either cry or experience stomach pain. There are so many scenes embedded with dumb, corny, and funny jokes in 21 Jump Street. For example, Schmidt and Jenko experience a high-speed car chase during traffic hours and they start shooting the ""bad guys,"" who are on motorcycles, but accidentally shoot huge gasoline tanks. The intense background music and logic of the situation calls for an epic explosion, however the filmmakers took the opportunity to sprinkle a little humor. Schmidt and Jenko act surprised to the camera when nothing explodes. Later on in the chase, they shoot another gasoline tank and the same intense background music starts to play again and the suspense starts to build until nothing explodes. Towards the end of the action-packed scene, Schmidt and Jenko accidentally shoot a truck full of chickens, and it explodes in the middle of the freeway. I laughed so hard that I almost peed my pants during this scene. That is comedy. Another reason why 21 Jump Street is worth watching is because of its relatability. 
 Schmidt and Jenko face the social standards and hardships of high school, which I and some of the audience can surely relate to. A lot of high schools today are still dealing with these problems. For instance, in the movie Jenko and Schmidt switch cliques and their classmates treat them quite differently. There is a lot of pressure on their shoulders because of the stress of high school and their secret assignment. For example, Jenko is not the smartest in his Chemistry class, however luckily he sought help from some of his classmates and succeeded in his final project. I can relate because I am not the smartest in some of my academic classes, but after receiving crucial help, I succeeded. 21 Jump Street is the best movie to watch not only because of its relatability, but also because of its intense action scenes.
 Jenko and Schmidt also experience crazy action packed instances that will have you at the edge of your seat and filled with excitement. In particular, when Jenko and Schmidt meet the drug dealer face to face, they blow their cover and have a shootout scene in a hotel room during prom. They get into another high speed chase and meet another plot twist. When they finally catch the loose drug dealer, Schmidt pulls the trigger and shoots the culprit in the private area. The directors again infuse comedy in a suspenseful action situation, which is why 21 Jump Street is the best film to watch.
 Even though some audience members think that 21 Jump Street ruined the original television series with explicit language, drug usage, and sexual content, it will forever be the greatest movie to ever hit theaters because of its hilarious action filled content and relatability. 21 Jump Street will surprise you with unexpected plot twists, corny puns, dangerous scenarios, and much more. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill portrayed their characters in the best way possible, which made the film even more of a success. You will not be disappointed, for Schmidt and Jenko will have you hooked and paying attention the entire time. 21 Jump Street is a must watch!"

"Screen_Blitz","9","0","1","24 September 2017"," Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum bring their infectious comedic chemistry to engulf us for a hilarious good time
","Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum band together in what appears to be yet another remake of a popular TV show of the same name. After a significant number of failed attempts to bring a televised source material to the big screen in an accurate fashion, it is understandable why people may approach this with low expectations. Against all odds, Hill and Tatum manage to bring their A-game to the table with their feverishly strong comedic appeal to grip us for an insanely hilarious comedic fare. Playing a duo of undercover cops with a diminishing sense of intelligence, these two make an irresistible pair for this devilishly raunchy buddy cop comedy directed by the likes of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who make a remarkable achievement of paying tribute to the popular source material while taking many liberties that create only a minimal resemblance of the 80s TV show. It is a movie that demands you to prepare for an all-out laugh-out-loud galore. This film follows Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) and Jenko (played by Channing Tatum), two men reuniting seven years after their high school graduation to attend a local police academy. While their graduation is success, these two prove to be way too amateurish to properly execute their jobs at law enforcement officers after they manage to botch their first arrest. This leads to their boss Deputy Chief Hardy (played by Nick Offerman) to transfer them to, wait for it.....21 Jump Street, an underachieving police department run by the foul-mouthed Captain Dickson (played by Ice Cube) who assigns them on a case that sends them back to high school as undercover cops disguised as students to bust the school's drug dealer who happens to distributing some mind- altering substances. As the duo becomes engulfed in reliving their high school days including partying and school plays, their social life with the fellow students put their jobs in danger. <br/><br/>This movie is not quite devoid of the typical buddy cop formula that has dominated the subgenre for the past few decades. But with the brilliant sleight of hand by the directors Phil Lord and Christoper Miller, a a solidly executed script, and the comedic adrenaline of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum; this movie works astonishingly well. It is funny almost consistently and rarely lets a single moment go to waste, even when the jokes border on the line of distasteful. And each time Hill and Tatum appear on screen, laughter almost immediately dominates the air as their chemistry allows us to relish in each scene. The script effectively blends its raunchy R-rated sex humor with clever messages about high school popularity and friendship, which come to productive use when the two leads get mixed with a crowd of high school cliques. In particularly, Jonah Hill's Schmidt forms a romance with cute blondie named Molly, played by Brie Larson, which comes to his surprise considering his lack of popularity in high school as demonstrated in the opening scene with him and the then-super- popular Jenko. Furthermore, the film also makes effective use of poking fun at high school stereotypes which accounts to some good laughs every now and then. But most importantly, it is the comedic performances by Hill and Tatum that keeps things flowing. And kudos should also go to Ice Cube who brings his foul-mouth, wise-cracking fever to the screen each minute we see him, and Rob Riggle who lets his comedic talent shine nearly every chance he gets. And when the characters finally get the chance to pull their guns out in the climax, viewers are treated with a sweet little cameo. <br/><br/>21 Jump Street is an exciting comedic endeavor that shows that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum make an effective team when tackling the buddy cop genre. The movie is funny, charming, and blisters with seemingly endless comedic fever that will, of course, turn off those alienate by a long line of raunchy humor that comes at almost consistently. If can withstand the crudeness, come along for the ride."

","Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.<br/><br/>Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original.<br/><br/>It has no heart.<br/><br/>It has no soul.<br/><br/>It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.<br/><br/>Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original."
"stefanogallo0","10","0","1","5 November 2016"," This is an extremely hilarious movie. Would 100% Recommend!
","21 Jump Street is an amazing comedy. I understand that it is based off of the late 1980's- 90's TV series of the same name, but I doubt the original was as funny as this remake. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have this amazing on screen chemistry that give audiences a genuine feel for their characters' relationship, and the jokes they get together are just top- notch. The idea of two buddy cops, one smart and awkward and the other handsome, strong and dim may not be an original one, but definitely adds to the film's appeal. Ice Cube as the angry police captain is a riot, and is guaranteed to get anyone busting their gut (especially the Korean Jesus joke). If you are looking for an original story, with deep drama, intrigue, and mystery then don't watch this movie. This is purely a smart and quick- witted spoof comedy, and it is probably the best in the genre. If you are looking for a great time, and just want to relax, sit down, and laugh your ass off, then this is must-see."
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","0","1","16 February 2016"," Comedies are just as capable of narrative brilliance as any other film
","This is without a doubt one of the funniest, cleverest and yet somehow sweetest comedies I have ever seen. Hill and Tatum both play against type as a minor plot curve ball immediately sets up the new premise of the film. Hill finds out that he is now considered cool, whilst Tatum falls in with the dorks and learns something. Its so easy for cheap comedies to skim the development and journeys of its characters, but 21 Jump Street is an amazing success.<br/><br/>Much of the credit goes to the brilliant writing of Michael Bacall, who packs a screenplay full of heart, wit and sheer hilarity. Hill and Tatum not only kill their delivery, but are brilliant physical comedians and have impeccable chemistry. Its not only believable but plausible that the two characters could be brothers. Literally every single joke in this film works to perfection and actually establishes character while entertaining. Schmidt is an idiot with weapons and social interactions, whilst Jenko is a buffoon with anything requiring smarts. The way the two play off each other and grow as men is utterly delightful.<br/><br/>Dave Franco is every inch the cool kid but also aces the freakout scenes later on. Brie Larson is adorable as Schmidt's love interest Molly. Ice Cube is a hilarious ""angry black captain"" stealing every single scene he's in. And there's one of the best cameos ever put to film towards the end. Phil Lord and Chris Miller direct the film with flair and you can tell they had an absolute ball making it with the flashy highlights and jolted cuts that make everything funny. <br/><br/>21 Jump Street only serves to highlight how badly 22 Jump Street missed its own point. The humour comes from the role reversal of Schmidt getting in too deep and so craving popularity he forgets what he is. Comedies can be brilliant film stories too, and 21 Jump Street knocks it out of the park."

","Although this remake seemed as a terrible Idea on paper, I must say that I was in the end, really pleasantly surprised.

There are many jokes that are very innovative and hilarious, and will come as real refreshment. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this duo. Channing Tatum is a spectacular and is acting out of his comfort zone. Jonah Hill had plenty of well written material so that everything seemed made in a fun quality way.

","Having already seen 22 jump Street and really enjoying it I have now seen 21 jump Street and I think it is even better. The premise of this film sees 2 underachieving cops and sent back to high school undercover to get rid of a deadly drug. Jonah hill is known as a comedic actor and he is great in this movie. His character is really different to most things he does and it ends up being really funny. But the real surprise in this film has to be Channing Tatum. Before these jump Street films I never knew how good or funny this guy was but he is fantastic in this movie and is also really funny. I liked the unique directions his character took and it helps that his chemistry with hill is amazing. Jonah hills love interest was good in the movie and was more then just a simple character and was actually believable in the film. Dave franco was also pretty good and had some funny moments too. Ice cube is the police captain and he was really funny in the film. I really enjoyed every scene he has in this film. Now the story of the them going back to high school was great and I liked how as time passes things change with stereotypes and they played on that in this movie. The only negative is that towards the end there is a villain reveal and it comes across as unnecessary and easy to predict but that is really my only negative with the film. The script is one of the best in recent memory. They totally make fun of themselves and say what the audiences think about reboots and the films premise. All the films jokes hit me and all the dramatic scenes really worked too. The style was great in this film. The action scenes were well done and also stayed in touch with the tone of the film which is important. Overall this is a fantastic comedy that everyone should see."

The type of humour is somewhat appealing for my taste, but it just falls totally flat at many times and is very forgettable. It just felt as if funny jokes became unfunny.

","If you're looking for a funny film to watch any time soon, then go and buy this DVD. 21 Jump Street is a typical film of this new comedy generation. With its witty humour, and serious storyline, this film really catches the attention of the audience, and has you hooked to the very end. The film has a continuous high quality action/comical theme to it throughout, mainly due to the high budget that has been cleverly distributed on the scenes of action e.g. the explosions and high tech filming equipment used to film the car chases etc. Along with this, another key feature to the likability and high quality of the film is the calibre of the cast with stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum playing the main characters 'Schmidt' and 'Jenko' who take a trip back to their high school youth in order to prove themselves as cops and take down the bad guys. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum both give extremely professional performances, portraying the characters well, and with two such highly rated actors playing the main characters, it complements and does the storyline and the writers directors and producers justice."

The first one that comes to mind is the amazing chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Channing Tatum was especially surprising since I have never known him to do anything that was even slightly comical. Tatum's jock character meshes perfectly with the geeky Jonah Hill.

Well, not exactly resentment, I just think most are incredibly stupid and so many times, they have a pretty mean streak, one that's sort of hard to swallow. This film, though, doesn't, and it's a pretty great time all around. Jonah Hill is definitely the MVP, and he's proving yet again to be such a comedic talent. Tatum is hilarious too, although not sure if his dead-pan style is intentional or just Tatum lacking energy. Regardless, it works.

It is a very, very funny!<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's on screen chemistry is fantastic. The film starts with them at school and from the start it highlights how completely opposite they are. They have many opposing personalities and attributes but they fit together perfectly. Jonah is the clever, sensible unpopular kid at school and Tatum is the cool, sporty popular kid at school. The film zooms forward 7 years to them both graduating Police Academy and from then, their chemistry really comes to life. Not long after they are sent back to School undercover as students. The whole cast is fantastic, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & Ice Cube are the stand outs for me. Ice Cube plays the role that he plays best: the angry, no nonsense & outspoken boss. It is certainly refreshing to see Tatum move away from his rom-com style films he is usually associated with and put in an equally impressive performance. Jonah however plays his usual role with crude jokes and unprovoked use of bad language; this isn't necessarily a bad thing though as it compliments Tatum's character very well.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It makes many references throughout which mimic action movies and their clichés. The car bonnet slides, the delayed explosions and the use of firearms are a few examples of this. It is a great mix of subtle one liners and slap stick action comedy scenes. <br/><br/>I would certainly recommend this film and I am still struggling to remember why I dismissed this movie as awful upon first watch a couple of years ago!<br/><br/>8/10"

Ridiculous meandering plot. No chemistry at all between the lead characters, even though this was supposed to be about a ""bromance"" between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Seeing all of these mystifyingly positive reviews makes me think of a famous line from George Carlin: ""Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize that half of them are stupider than that.""

For example, the only redeeming value of the Lost in Space movie were the action sequences. But still, they couldn't overcome a lack luster story. However, 21 Jump Street is different. It is actually a great movie and made me a fan of the TV show too. Holly Robinson's cameo reprising her role as Hobbs is okay, but she only appears once and that is for just a few seconds.

","As of late there have been few movies that have made me laugh. Specifically comedies that have been able to make me laugh. Recent comedies haven't really been funny and usually require gross out humor to be funny. But 21 Jump Street is a wonderful exception. The movie is funny, entertaining, and it's an overall good movie.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is a continuation from the original series back in the 80s-90s. What surprised me a bit is that the movie actually recognizes the original series and that understanding the original series is important for one of the greatest jokes/cameos in Hollywood history. Most people were confused as to why I was laughing so hard because they hadn't watched or even known about the original 21 Jump Street. <br/><br/>A nice thing about the movie is that the characters a likable. Comedies with annoying characters are unbearable but this movie has a good cast of characters who I genuinely felt concerned for. The duo of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was shockingly good. The two played their roles perfectly and it was really nice to see the character development between the two. This was yet another surprising element for me because most comedies don't try to have any important character development but this movie actually succeeded in doing so even though it's not going to be anything like Citizen Kane. It was still a nice addition.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the movie. The jokes were funny, high- schoolish, and inappropriate but it never used gross out humor and never needed to use nudity or anything in that realm for its jokes. A refreshing comedy."
"eliotshaw","8","0","1","28 November 2012"," A surprisingly competent comedy
","This really has no right to be any good. It's a wacky buddy cop movie loosely based off a 1980's American TV show that helped propel Johnny Depp into world-wide recognition. This really should have crashed and burned like all the other ""tongue in cheek"" takes on a really tired formula. But somehow they make it work, mostly through a pretty hilarious screenplay by Michael Bacall and through pretty solid performances by the two leads, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>To sum up the movies plot briefly for those who haven't seen the show and who can't read plot synopsis on wikipedia, Schmidt (Hill)was the socially illiterate high school nerd who is of course incapable of getting a date for the prom and Jenko (Tatum)was the dumb but handsome jock who can't pass such and such class to go to the prom or whatever. Fast forward 8 years and they're both in police academy where Schmidt cannot run and Jenko cannot learn. They realise that they can cover the other's deficiencies and naturally bond, becoming good friends. However after a drug bust at the park goes south they're transferred to an undercover unit designed to disguise officers as high school students where they can infiltrate the local gang or, in this case, investigate the new drug on the market. So Schmidt and Jenko have to go back to school again! (cue the wacky hijinks)<br/><br/>If that plot sounds stereotypical it's because it is and the film's script revels in it's stupid premise. Numerous references are made to the fact the actors look to be in their late 20s/early 30s which is something that is immediately apparent in way to many high school movies. Their police captain is played by Ice Cube as a very funny take on the angry black superior trope that infested shows in the 80s. Later in the movie there's a heated car chase and genuine surprise when several easily flammable objects don't explode. However I would say it goes to far in terms of parody and homage in lieu of creating original content, something that the movie even acknowledges when describing the 21 Jump Street program. <br/><br/>Of the two leads they both give good performances, in particular Channing Tatum who has surprisingly good comedic timing. He should stop doing all those god-awful romantic movies and take up more comedic roles. I also like how the focus is on their friendship not their rivalry, I'm sure the temptation to make this movie the nerd vs the jock must have been overwhelming for the writer. Thankfully it was not to be. The rest of the cast plays their role adequately with no standout performances with a brilliant cameo at the end that I simply couldn't spoil.<br/><br/>So this is a funnier and deeper movie than it has any right to be. High School was a tough time for many of us and I sure know I'd like to redo it with all the ""wisdom"" and ""experience"" I've gained over the years. Though maybe I'd find I'm just a different kind of idiot now."
"freemantle_uk","8","0","1","18 November 2012"," Channing Tatum has found his calling
","Movie adaptation of hit TV shows are always a risky task as filmmakers try and adapt a property with a new cast and updating it to a contemporary age. The adaption and re-make 21 Jump Street decides a different approach, changing the genre from a police drama to a high school/buddy comedy film, with excellent results.<br/><br/>In 2005 Schmidt (Jonah Hill) is a nerd and a loser, bullied by the very stupid Jenko (Channing Tatum), a popular jock. However the two become friends at the police training academy, Schmidt helping Jenko with his academic work, whilst Jenko motivates Schimdt with physical training. During their arrest the pair show their incompetents when Jenko does not write the Miranda rights to a suspect and their superior officer transfers them to 21 Jump Street, a special division that sends young officers into high school. Their mission, to infiltrate a drugs ring in a high school and find the supplier of a new manufactured drug before it spreads to other schools. Yet the officers' roles are reversed, with Schmidt the popular kid and Jenko, the loser outsider.<br/><br/>What makes 21 Jump Street what is that it is a self-aware comedy and was prepared to embrace clichés of the high school and buddy comedy/action comedy genres so the filmmakers could make fun of them. 21 Jump Street shows that it is willing to make fun of Hollywood and the idea's process, the archetypes of high school and in police films. The popular kids at high school are shown to be a mixed bag, people who care about their futures, not in a particular clique and made to seem a bit more real. Admittedly the nerd characters were a bit too stereotypical but we can't have everything and at least they were not made out to be total losers. There are bites again buddy cop clichés, with Ice-T having great lines and put downs as the angry, black police captain.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is more focused on comedy then action, but there comic action set pieces, one early one in the film, the other being a car chase on the freeway, playing on the idea that a freeways are busy and has fun against the bombast of other action-comedies like Lethal Weapon and Bad Boys.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller whose previous film was Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, a family animated film: yet they moved into an adult comedy with ease and there is even a really trippy scene when the characters are high, inject a surreal style to the film.<br/><br/>In the past I have critical of Tatum in the past, having seen him in films like G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Haywire but with 21 Jump Street he found his strongest suit, comedy. He had great comic timing and relations with Hill. Jenko grows as a character throughout the film, becoming more likable, understanding, smarter, loyal and intelligent. With the right direction he can become a great action star.<br/><br/>Whilst 21 Jump Street is a really entertaining film there are some criticisms. The first is Dave Franco: I know him best for role in the last series of Scrubs where he was very annoying . He just felt like a pretentious little man and was just well, a non-present in the film. The other is the relationship between Schmidt and Molly (Brie Larson) where it just felt a little out of place. Larson was fine in the film, it basically felt like fantasy reliving for Hill. The filmmakers should have focused more on the flirting and infatuation of the chemistry teacher (Ellie Kemper) who fancied Jenko and knowing it is wrong. It was played up in the trailers.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is an enjoyable comedy, a refreshing take on both the buddy genre and high school genre and entertaining film."

","Not many people of today's generation realize that this was a TV show! People of my generation remember it fondly though.

Of course, it isn't as easy as it sounds.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a decent movie with a decent blend of drama, comedy, action, and surprising (and amusing) cameos.

Watching this movie with friends is definitely the way to go. It is assured you will finish the movie by peeing your pants. <br/><br/>On the other hand, this movie is inappropriate and has cussing. It should be required to be thirteen years old; or maybe even older to watch ""21 Jump Street."" I also suggest to watch this movie without parents. Things could quickly become awkward if watched with an adult. Additionally, I suggest having a good sense of humor if you consider watching this movie. However, ""21 Jump Street"" is a prodigiously fantastic film. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the plot of this movie can relate to many teen's life. Essentially, this movie is about two police men going back to high school to find synthetic drugs the students are using. Throughout the movie, the two policemen realize what it's like being in high school again. Dealing with drugs, friendship, and love are all main parts of the movie. Countless teens deal with all these things, so it is a great movie to watch if you are going through high school. Just like Captain Dickson says in the movie, ""They teenagers, man. They really stupid."" Parts like this are great for laughs and good times. Movies where teens can basically laugh at themselves are the best. <br/><br/>In conclusion, ""21 Jump Street"" is an enjoyable movie with excellent actors, clever humor, and a relatable plot. In the future maybe there will be a sequel for all we know. Personally, I would love to see a sequel to ""21 Jump Street."" Hopefully, more people consider watching this movie because I can assure you this: you will not regret it."

","""21 Jump Street"" is an excellent film. It contains everything a comedy film needs. It has great actors, great setting, and it was hilarious. This was one of my favorite films ever.<br/><br/>Furthermore, ""21 Jump Street"" had great actors. Jonah Hill was the perfect role for Schmidt. He was the nerd in high school and was hilarious. I loved his acting. Channing Tatum also did a great job in this film. He played the role of Jenko. He was the ""jock"" in high school. He was a very funny cop. Overall he did a great job. Ice Cube did an okay job in this film. He played the role of Captain Dickson. The way he ""acts"" doesn't wow me. He acts like he does not want to be there. Maybe that's the way he is supposed to act but I do not like the way he acts. Overall, the actors were amazing. <br/><br/>In addition, there was a great setting in this movie. Having them go back to high school was a great idea and I give props to Phil Lord and Chris Miller for directing this film so well. The way that they fit in so well at high school was amazing. Jonah and Channing were hilarious when they were cops, great job Phil and Chris. Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" had a great Setting. <br/><br/>Although this movie was awesome, this movie had some scenes that weren't very good. One of these is when they are having a party and the parents walk in. This ruins it. They should have had the parents come home when everyone was leaving. It would have set the mood a lot better and it could have made it a hilarious scene. Another scene I didn't like very much is when the guys weaner gets shot off. That was just gross. The actors should have just left him there to die. They didn't have to shoot his balls. I think that was a little uncalled for. This was still an awesome movie, but if they are going to make another one they should take these things into account.<br/><br/>In addition, this movie was hilarious. This was hands down the funniest film I have watched in a long time. Channing played an amazing cop. He chased down the motorcycle gang and when he caught them. He was so proud that he forgot the Miranda rights. This was the funniest scene in the film. Another scene that is hilarious in this movie is when they are getting the drugs for the party they are throwing. This was the funniest movie ever. <br/><br/>Additionally, if you haven't seen ""21 Jump Street"" you haven't lived. Go to a local RedBox or something and get it. It is worth watching. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to go to high school? Watch this movie and you will know what going back to high school feels like. Please make another film. This was an amazing film and I irk you all to watch this film."

","Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum respectively play Schmidt and Jenko, two rookie cops assigned to a special unit in which all the officers go undercover as high school students in order to bust various crimes. The outfit's commanding officer (Ice Cube) orders the pair to find out who's pushing a deadly drug at a local high school. Jenko (Tatum), a popular slacker during his own high school days, looks forward to heading back to class, while Schmidt (Hill), who was a miserable nerd during that period, dreads it. But they unexpectedly find their social standings reversed, with Schmidt becoming known for throwing killer parties and Jenko hanging out with the chemistry set.<br/><br/>The movie offers an acceptable number of hearty laughs (albeit most packed during the first half), yet what's most refreshing about the film is how it acknowledges its own narrative absurdities and retreaded tropes in a manner that's neither forced nor self-congratulatory (love the running gag about exploding vehicles). 21 Jump Street wears its cool comfortably, and its nerdiness just as effectively. Also includes a Johnny Depp cameo near the end in which he does not stay around for long (pun intended).<br/><br/>*Rewatching 21 Jump Street a year later (12/20/13), my thoughts about the film are about the same. Not much I did not notice on my first viewing I picked up on my second viewing. What makes the film work is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, as well as the supporting actors. The comedy is still there and clever as well as the action (specifically more towards the second half of the film once they get themselves to the prom- the sequences steadily pick up). After all that, I am more looking forward to the sequel 22 Jump Street in 2014 and hope it is as good as 21 Jump Street, if not better!"
"sbart123","9","0","2","2 October 2012"," 21 Jump Street Review
","Do you like movies that have explosions, intense comedy, and jaw-dropping action scenes? Well, if you do this movie you should watch. The whole entire movie has the items listed above, and are through out the movie. 21 Jump Street was actually based on a T.V. show that aired from 1987 to 1991, and was created by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell.<br/><br/>In the new movie the two main actors are Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Channing Tatum played Jenko, the police officer and went under cover as a student at high school. Jonah Hill played Schmidt, who played a police officer and went under cover as a high school student. The special effects were astounding, and were done/ designed by Guy Clayton Jr. He has done special effects for other movies like; All the King's Men, The Final Destination, Mysterious Island, Xtinction: Predator X, Dylan Dog: Dead of Kight, That's What I Am, and many more.<br/><br/>This movie has a marvelous beginning and the action never stopped from that point on, in my opinion it was a perfect way to start a movie. There wasn't any confusion of what was going on, and an audience could understand it clearly, preciously, and humorously. The plot of this movie was easy to find and, good for the type of movie, this was. The middle of the movie had the right mix of action, drama, and explosions. The length of the movie happens to be 110 minutes, so when you watch the movie, go to the bathroom before, because you wouldn't miss any part of this movie<br/><br/>Although there were a whole bunch of other movies that came out during the same time as 21 Jump Street, 21 Jump Street was still better. The other movies such as; The Dictator, Ted, The Campaign, and Batman were decent too, but they didn't really get my attention, as 21 Jump Street did. These movies I enjoyed, but there was either too much explosions, to much time where you couldn't understand anything, and just the whole movie did correspond with the title.<br/><br/>To conclude 21 Jump Street was an outstanding movie and I didn't see any flaws against it. The ending had action, explosion, and was just flat out hilarious. Although there were other decent movies, those movies didn't even come close to how good 21 Jump Street was. I loved everything about it and was just flat out, an amazing movie."

","I was only a few years old when the original television show hit the airwaves, so I only know the original as the show that starred a young Johnny Depp. That's about it. I had little interest in seeing this movie until the reviews started hitting the web and touting it as a lot funnier than I would have imagined. I still haven't gotten over how horrible THE SITTER was, so Jonah Hill was not high on my list of must-see headliners. And the only film I'd seen Channing Tatum in was G.I. JOE, which isn't exactly a comedy (well, not intentionally). But I was wrong to doubt them because 21 JUMP STREET is the funniest movie I've seen so far this year. This is 21 JUMP STREET for a new generation; specifically, a generation that isn't necessarily familiar with the television show. The premise is the same: police officers infiltrating a high school. But it's done with a modern sense of humor and an edge. Schmidt (Hill) was always a loser in high school, a bleach-blonde Eminem wannabe without an ounce of style. Jenko (Tatum) was your typical obnoxious jock, popular with the students while neglecting his studies. After graduation Schmidt and Jenko, find themselves enrolled in the police academy where their opposite talents (Schmidt's academics and Jenko's physicality) lead them to become partners and best friends. They're soon transferred to Jump Street where they are sent undercover at the local high school to flush out the dealers of a new drug called HFS. High school should be a cinch this time around, but things have changed<br/><br/>This movie could have easily gone in a terrible direction. It could have been a tired rehashing of the same old material and been lazy with the jokes. The premise makes it an easy target: a buddy cop movie set in a high school. Sure, there are some jokes you might see coming here but 21 JUMP STREET does what it can to spin your expectations. From the start of their investigation, things go wrong when Schmidt and Jenko accidentally swap their new identities. So now Schmidt has the sleeper classes and Jenko finds himself tackling AP Chemistry. Now each of them is dropped into the opposite clique from what they originally experienced in high school and must continue to blend in. It opens up a hilarious new set of gags for the movie when Schmidt is finally the popular new kid on campus, a position he cherishes a little too much. Jonah Hill has redeemed himself for THE SITTER and he's back in true form here, while Tatum has proved that he's got some great comedic acting chops. Honestly, Tatum has some of the funniest scenes in the movie. And the two of them have great buddy chemistry together. Jonah Hill shares a writing credit on this movie, so I have to give some respect to him for putting together (with Michael Bacall) an awesome action/comedy that excels as both genres.<br/><br/>Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have collected an excellent supporting cast for the movie including Ice Cube, Dave Franco, Brie Larson, and Rob Riggle. Cube is the angry captain in charge of the Jump Street unit, openly embracing the stereotype of the angry black captain (he worked his a** off to become captain and, yeah, he gets angry sometimes). Larson is the ""sort of"" love interest for Schmidt when he gets in close with the popular kids. And then there's Rob Riggle, a man I have yet to see fail at being hilarious, as the school's P.E. teacher Mr. Walters. This movie is loaded with laughs, and one of the few movies I actually laughed out loud at this year. The action scenes are surprisingly well done too. The movie has it's share of car chases and gun play, and it's always played for laughs. From the beginning, Schmidt and Jenko want nothing more than to be the sort of cops they see in movies and TVjumping away from explosions with guns blazingand by the time the movie is over, they'll be living the dream. 21 JUMP STREET is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a solid comedy with a dose of action. There are even a few cameos in the movie to satisfy fans of the original television show even if people like me don't catch any but the best one near the finale. There's really enough in 21 JUMP STREET for fans and non-fans to enjoy."

I was surprised how good it actually was. You must bear in mind I have never reviewed a film before and I am doing this about 10 minutes after finishing it. It's a film I could watch over and over again (not just because Channing Tatum is gorgeous but because its a great film). Girls and guys alike will love this. Needless to say after the rental goes back I will be buying the blu-ray straight away. A must watch for anyone who hasn't already. I can't wait for the sequel, it cannot come quick enough.

"madbandit20002000","8","0","1","24 September 2012"," Become a Narc, if you want to go back to school
","Don't you wish you could go back to high school and get a second chance, if you didn't get the hot girl or weren't academically adept? I pretty much don't care for high school anymore, but shlubby nerd Morton Schimdt (Oscar nominee Jonah Hill of ""Moneyball"" and ""Superbad"") and hunky himbo Greg Jenko (Channing Tautm of ""Fighting"" and ""Magic Mike"") sure do. They're narcs (undercover cops) in the ribald but fun film version of the late 1980s Fox Network police drama, ""21 Jump Street"".<br/><br/>Once high school foes, Schimdt and Jenko end up as pals while attending police academy (like the show, the film's locale isn't specified). However, the two are total foul-ups on the field, thereby getting banished to the resurrected Jump Street program, supervised by the no-B.S. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube of the ""Friday"" films), who assigns them, as siblings, to a school where a new synthetic drug's giving its users crazy highs and morbid endings. Instead of getting a hold of the drug supplier, hilarity ensues: Jenko hangs with the geeks while Schmidt's with both the drama and track & field club, after an ID mix-up; a car chase sequence where nothing flammable explodes, except a truck filled with chickens, and the two throw a party, involving underage teens, alcohol and marijuana. Is anyone here a grown up? With a straight raunchy script by Hill and Michael Bacall (""Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, ""Project X""), co- directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"") delightful play around with high school conventions (geeks are cool while jocks are otherwise), getting far (but not too far) from the series, co-created by Patrick Hasburgh and the late Stephen J. Cannell (he served as one of the film's producers before his passing). The wacky drug imagery would have a no-no on the show (broadcast standards and practices, people), but is welcomed here with open arms.<br/><br/>Hill and Tatum are a reliable pair of Peter Pan (the former wears a Peter Pan costume for a school play even!) while Cube, recalling his gangster rap days with a permanent growl, verbally admonishes them. When he threatens to defecate on them while they're wearing snorkels, it's something that can't be erased out of the human mind because it's both crude and hysterical. As popular drug dealer Eric, Dave Franco (James's younger sib) is both sleazy and goofy; he does business while working on the high school's yearbook! As Molly, a drama club member, Brie Larson (""The United States of Tara"") is an awkward lover interest for Schimdt, due to age difference and borderline pedophilia (jeez!!!), but she does well in her part. I wish there was more of P.E. teacher Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle of ""The Hangover""), but he's relevant to the story. Ellie Kemper (""The Office"", US Version) is squirrel-brain cute as a physics teach who geekily crushes on Jenko. Series regulars Johnny Depp, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson-Peete make eye-wink cameos as Tom Hanson, Doug Penhall and Judy Hoffs. D.P. Barry Peterson captures comedy bliss in the high school environment.<br/><br/>Though some hard-core fans of the show, which was basically a mash-up of ""The Mod Squad"" and the TV after school specials of the 1970s and 1980s, will cringe at the coarse humor (ex: a character gets his genitalia shot off and pathetically tries to retrieve it in his mouth while handcuffed), ""21 Jump Street"" does well with the off-idea of becoming an undercover cop, if you screwed up in high school. It's just like retaking a test!"

","Being in the UK, I was only aware of the show 21 Jump Street retrospectively because of Johnny Depp becoming famous; other than that I had never seen it but figured that this would be fine to watch the film remake. The plot is as the show, two young police officers are selected to go undercover in the school system as students in order to crack open the drugs trade by befriending the dealers and then uncovering the supplier above them. As one would expect, hilarity ensues. Well, sort of.<br/><br/>Billed as a comedy 21 Jump Street could never be accused of being high-brow or setting its sights too high. The tone of the film is not as low as gross-out comedy, but generally the tone is juvenile and consistently crude. This shows itself in the constant swearing, the noise that it brings with itself and the sense of it being a lot less funny than it thinks it is. It is a shame because it had potential; it has a nice tone of self-mockery but it is never done smartly enough to really take (it is spelt out in mile-high letters, ruining the impact it could have had). Along with some of this, there are specific jokes and moments that I laughed at (bits of Ice Cube's excessive delivery, the lack of explosions during a car chase etc) but mostly the humour is broad and wide and simple in the extreme. Part of the problem for me was that it wasn't sharp enough – it felt baggy and relaxed in a way that sort of suits the characters and the tone of the film, but doesn't suit the material. As a result the jokes feel softer than they should be and they are always worked harder than they can stand.<br/><br/>By this I mean the time spent on each. Some are hit and move on and they work well for it, but too often we have the joke settling in and having too much time on it, so that the film and the actors feel like they are trying too hard with lesser material, which I guess is partially true at least. Hill and Tatum benefit from playing against type (to a point) but neither is great here – just noisy and boisterous. Larson has nothing to really do while Franco's main impact is to continually bug you about where you've seen him before (until you realise you're thinking of his brother). Riggle is a funny guy – I know this because I'm a Daily Show fan, but here he is just noisy (a little funny – but not too much). Ice Cube is OK but his one-joke performance really only made me laugh once or twice.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street isn't an awful film by any means – it is just a very broad and unpolished one. The jokes lacks sharpness and the film feels like it is overdoing most things and trying too hard for too little return. There are moments and jokes that made me laugh but they were too few and far between, leaving distracting and slightly amusing noise to fill the rest of the film. So-so at best and it really needs you to be in a lazy, Friday-night mindset before you even bother approaching it."

","Date: August.12, 2012 -First Time Watch- After hearing all the good right ups on this movie I decided I had to check it out for myself. The story follows two police officers, Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum) who want to get their first bust and stop patrolling parks. Since their chief finds them incompetent of doing anything right he sends them to Jump Street, where they will go undercover as high school students and find out who is supplying kids with drugs. Of course a series of events occur that provides plenty of laughs, more then I expected. Channing Tatum is fantastic and he should do more comedy. I really enjoyed this movie, but I could have gone with a little less swearing. Definitely not a good movie for kids under fifteen to watch. Overall an enjoyable movie and I can't wait for the sequel! 8/10"

","Before I recommend this to everyone, forget about the fact that yes, it's a rehash, and yes, The Sitter was lackluster. Moving on, 21 Jump Street is, without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen and you will have seen in a long time. To list all the strengths of the film take up a lot of time. So I shall start from the start. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (who has finally found his calling) are both dead serious and painfully hilarious at the same time as high-school foes turned cop buddies. Both have their share of sharp one-liners and outrageous antics. But their characters seem to help each other out with Schmidt (Hill) as the highly intelligent but painfully nerdy geek and Jenko (Tatum) as the strong and handsome but somewhat dim-witted jock. Both join the police force and quickly become friends by using their strengths to overcome the other's weaknesses. <br/><br/>After failing to arrest a gang leader, the two are sent to the undercover unit known as ""21 Jump Street"" which utilizes youthful officers to be sent back to high school. After accepting their first assignment given to them by their hard-ass, overly-clichéd boss,(Ice Cube), they head to the local high school with the job of infiltrating and bringing down a new drug ring. The drug is known only as H.F.S (what do you think that stands for...) and possesses some very weird and very funny side-effects.<br/><br/>What happens next is not just a gigantic laugh-fest, but also a satisfyingly entertaining roller-coaster ride which includes but is not limited to: A car chase that breaks all the rules in the handbook, a nightmare party that not even Project X could match, a cameo and the shocking identity of the supplier. <br/><br/>The first-class humor is a combination of wittiness, gaggery, foul language and grossly sexual humor as well as a ton of insults that no show is safe from. <br/><br/>If you just forget the fact it's a rehash and brace yourself for the unpredictable and brilliant humor that will follow, you WILL be rushing to the doctors, screaming for pain-relief and depressants, all the while laughing uncontrollably.<br/><br/>An easy 9/10. Minus a 1 for the poor choice of music at the party."
"MovieReviews101","8","0","1","8 August 2012"," A Great Movie
","I never thought I would like a movie where Channing Tatum was in it. He was actually the main reason why I liked this movie, he had to change quite a lot and he did it really well. Jonah Hill was just the same funny guy. I laughed so much while watching this movie. This movie is basically a modern twist on the old '21 jump street' television show. It's a ridiculous movie but you will love it. You will think that it is another silly action movie however you will be wrong. There was a little to much swearing but I didn't mind. This is a definite must see. If I go to a friend's house I will make them watch this even if they think that Channing Tatum will be crap. This is high school comedy and high school comedy is nearly always funny. I really do recommend it you will be surprised about how good it is."

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum work really well. <br/><br/>With Johnny Deep at the end it works really well because of him being in the original series of 21 jump street. <br/><br/>So to finish this off great movie one of the best movies of the year 9/10 and great acting from Johan Hill and Channing Tatum."

Never for a second was I bored, and I burst out laughing at every joke, and I have to say, there's not many films I can say that about.<br/><br/>Sure, for more mature audiences the dick jokes and sight of teens partying might put them off the fun, but teens themselves will be impossibly thrilled. It's cleverly written and brilliantly stylised, and never lets up, not for a second.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill work brilliantly together, and Johnny Depp's cameo (which I was not expecting and was pleasantly surprised by) was a real treat. And even the comedic car chases and shoot-outs had me on the edge of my seat, as well as laughing my ass off.<br/><br/>Another good point is the soundtrack: it's exciting and has a kind of retro 1980's feel, though it isn't too retro for modern audiences.<br/><br/>Overall, 21 Jump Street is perfect for teen or fun-loving audiences, but people looking for something serious won't be so thrilled. I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>Overall: 9.6/10<br/><br/>See it if you liked: Kick-Ass (2010), Hot Fuzz (2007), Superbad (2007), Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)"

"estebangonzalez10","8","0","1","7 May 2012"," Surprisingly funny comedy
","¨You know what they do to handsome guy like me in prison. It rhymes with grape.¨ I have to admit I knew nothing about the TV series before watching this movie, but I did find it to be one of the best comedies of the year. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were great together in this buddy comedy and the dialogue in this film was extremely funny although very vulgar (as Jonah Hill always is). 21 Jump Street, directed by the duo that brought us Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Phil Lord and Chris Miller, is a very entertaining and funny film. It had me laughing from the very beginning. I can't say if it is anything like the series was because this is a buddy comedy and I understand the series was more of a mystery action drama. I guess if you were a fan of the series you might enjoy some of the references and cameos that showed up in the movie, but it isn't important to know anything about it because 21 Jump Street works on its own as a very funny comedy. The script written by Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. the Word) and Jonah Hill is very slick and funny. There are plenty of smart and funny dialogues throughout the film. I was entertained from the very beginning all the way to the very end so I absolutely recommend this movie.<br/><br/>Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was nothing like Jenko (Channing Tatum) in High School, Schmidt was more of a nerd while Jenko was the popular jock. Despite not being friends in school, they meet at the Police Academy and decide they can help each other out: Schmidt is good with the written test, but lacks the physical strength, while Jenko is in perfect shape but can't pass the exams. The two help each other out and become best friends before graduating as police officers. Life in uniforms isn't as full of action as they expected as they are assigned to guard a local park in their bikes. They are finally given the opportunity to go undercover at a local High School where a dangerous synthetic drug is being dealt with. They are only chosen because both still look young so Schmidt and Jenko find themselves back in school. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them with their new identities and Schmidt is sent back to his parent's house along with his new brother Jenko. At school their identities are swapped and Jenko ends up with the nerds studying advanced chemistry while Schmidt has to deal with acting lessons and sports. Somehow Schmidt begins to enjoy life as one of the popular kids in the group, while Jenko discovers what it's like not to be popular anymore. Schmidt befriends Eric (Dave Franco) right away as he discovers he is one of the dealers, and also falls for Molly (Brie Larson) his acting partner.<br/><br/>The movie works really well thanks to the great chemistry between Tatum and Hill, and thanks to the smart script. I wasn't really expecting this movie to be as good as it was so I was really surprised with how much I ended up enjoying this film. I left the theater with a big smile on my face. It is one of those movies which you won't have any trouble going to see it again with other friends who haven't seen it. The cameos in this film are also pretty great and I enjoyed each one of them. The movie also makes some funny references about itself so it actually acknowledges some of the ridiculousness of its plot which actually makes it even funnier. There is one scene where they are ripping off how movies from the 80's are being recycled now due to lack of fresh ideas. 21 Jump Street isn't afraid of laughing at itself and its silly premise, which ends up making the film even better. This is one of the surprise comedies of 2012, and I hope plenty of more come out this year.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","'21 JUMP STREET': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Jonah Hill co-wrote and co-stars in this Buddy Cop film reboot of the popular 80's TV series. Channing Tatum also co-stars and Michael Bacall (who also co-wrote 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD' and 'PROJECT X') co-wrote the screenplay. Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who also directed 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS') directed the film. The combination of Hill and Tatum is gold as far as buddy films go and the script is about as witty as anyone could have hoped for from the Johnny Depp career launcher! <br/><br/>The original Fox Network TV series ran from 1987 to 1991 and starred Johnny Depp, Richard Grieco, Steven Williams, Holly Robinson, Peter and Michael De Luise and others as young undercover police officers busting crime in high schools and other youth hangouts. This film picks up over twenty years later with the operation being reinstated. It focuses on two rookie cops (Hill and Tatum), who knew each other in high school when Tatum's character bullied Hill's, that are now teamed together to stop a synthetic drug gang.<br/><br/>Hill and Bacall's script is genius and the directing fits the material but it's Hill and Tatum that really make the movie work. A 'Buddy Film' is only as good as it's buddies and Hill and Tatum work magic together. The film doesn't have a lot to do with the original series but some of it's stars do show up in memorable cameos. As far as action goes the movie isn't really that thrilling either but the jokes are witty and the leading man chemistry is beautiful.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vhN3UBteY"
"drqshadow-reviews","8","0","2","3 May 2012"," Nothing's Sacred, Not Even Itself, in This Shockingly Funny Resurrection
","Although this looked, by all indications, to be just another empty cash-in on a familiar franchise from thirty years ago, in reality it's a completely self-aware semi-satire that's funnier than it has any right to be. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum take their roles about as seriously as the film does itself (read: not at all) but still manage to develop a weird sort of chemistry as a helplessly stupid, modernized odd couple. It's to be expected that they'll stumble and bumble their way to the head of a major criminal organization. But rather than trying in vain to avoid the clichés inherent with such a familiar premise, Jump Street completely embraces them and actually dictates its decision to do so. Maybe the best example of this is in Nick Offerman's all-too-brief cameo, as he stares down the lens and deadpans a monologue about recycling thin gimmicks from the past. For storyline purposes, he's talking about the department resuscitating the Jump Street undercover program, but it doesn't take a grin or a wink to know what he's really on about. He grins and winks anyway. As a parody of everything from its genre to its audience, this is pointedly effective stuff. It struggles to develop into anything more serious, but that's not really the point."

","Honestly, it wasn't like most high school related comedy flicks. Definitely struck a chord with me after watching the string of American Pies and random similar movies such as The Inbetweeners. The thing is, this movie really was well structured unlike most others of this specific genre within comedy.<br/><br/>Before this movie I never really heard about Channing Tatum and after watching it, it is fixed in my mind that he is an intriguing actor. Although he may apply commonplace techniques, there is an aura which he creates as a part of his role which makes one feel glad and at times feel like they can't hold in their laughter, no matter how stupid or not he acts.<br/><br/>My personal view is that without Ice Cube being in the role that he was in, this movie's flair wouldn't have been as grand. His role, though of less screen time, definitely impacts the movie in a large way.<br/><br/>Coming to the aforementioned structure, there weren't as many random events which occur so spontaneously as other high-school based comedies. That being said, there was a decent flow of chronology and not too much of ""I can't believe that simple thing led to this huge situation"". Although this review may not justify an 8, I honestly had a good time watching the movie as opposed to having more than needed time to analyze peripheral matter in the movie, which a good sign in this context.<br/><br/>In general, this movie offers one a good time, a good laugh, and a good reason to feel content. The story being particularly different appealed to me, which is something one may want to remember whilst watching."

","21 Jump Street is the funniest movie since Bridemaids and I recommend it to anybody besides little kids because this is a rated R movie. It is so funny and found myself laughing without me realizing I'm laughing. Jonah Hill is funny as always and lost weight, I respect that. Channing Tatum was a good a comedy guy and this is the first comedy I have seen him in. Not was the movie really funny, the story was good and made sense. There was action too. All I'm going to tell is that Jonah and Channing are young cops that screw up and become part of a special group of young cops who go undercover in high school for drug busts and things of that nature. Ice cube is the leader of this group and is very funny and is a good supporting role. This movie is funny and I don't know why some people do not and will not like this movie. It's fun for everyone."
"Anurag-Shetty","9","0","3","21 April 2012"," One of the funniest adult comedies of all time! Even raunchier and funnier than The Hangover series.
","The movie begins with it's two main characters Schimdt(Jonah Hill) & Jenko(Channing Tatum) screwing up badly in high school due to which neither of them can attend the ever so looked forward to high school prom. Fast forward 5 or 10 years & the both of them are undergoing rigorous training and tests to become cops. During this time Schimdt & Jenko become the best of friends unlike their time in high school where they were complete opposites. Jenko was the cool guy & Schimdt was the bumbling geek. However, once they become cops they fail miserably at their jobs even forgetting to read an important law after arresting a criminal. So, the head police officer Captain Dickson(Ice Cube), gives them an undercover investigation where the 30+ friends pose as teenagers & return to high school to stop the manufacture & making of an extremely dangerous synthetic drug. This is a nightmare for Schimdt but a pleasant surprise for Jenko. From here on the hilarity ensues(though it was funny even till now).<br/><br/>Schimdt & Jenko have absolutely no idea as to what they're doing. High school was way different when they were young than now. Now the geeks are popular & the so called 'cool' people are unpopular. A mix up between the IDs made for each of them specially for their second round of high school, gets Schimdt doing all the cool stuff like drama classes, races & other so called cool stuff. Jenko, on the other hand has to do the geeky stuff like chemistry club, band practice etc. This mix up between the roles they were supposed to play & the roles they play eventually is one of the major points that makes this movie Laughing My Ass Off(LMAO) material! Schimdt finally gets to be cool & Jenko finally gets to be smart. The chemistry shared between Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum is simply mind blowing! These two, with all their fat guy, tough guy, good cop, bad cop, histrionics light up the film leaving the viewer in splits. Awesome job guys! The supporting characters like Eric(Dave Franco), Molly(Brie Larson) & Mr.Walters(Rob Riggle) are hilarious as well. A special mention should be for Ice Cube whose done a spectacular job in his too funny to be true portrayal of Captain Dickson. So, I would like to wrap up by saying 21 Jump Street is a must watch especially if you love the adult comedy genre. Even if you don't, I'm sure it will definitely surpass your expectations. Go, have a blast!"

","When I turned up to the cinema to watch the new Jonah Hill picture in my new Porshe Carrera with a raging 5.7 litre DOHC V10 engine, I was quite reminiscent of the old days before the car; the days when one would stroll to the local cinema and gaze at the luminescent black and white screen in awe of the latest cowboy flick. But the time is now. And now shall I write the best film review of this film on this entire website.<br/><br/>As the last film I saw Jonah Hill star in was Moneyball, I had heard he had lost a substantial amount of weight. This was in fact true - I could hardly recognise the character as he appeared on the giant screen. I looked up in amazement and shouted BOO YA, U LOOKIN GOOD BOI! Aloud in the cinema. I was payed some looks from my fellow cinema goers but after I told a short anecdote they had lost focus on me, and more on the antics of Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>He played his ""nerdy"", ""querky"" character very well, and as we all know so well this his forte and persona in many of his latest films; the significance of this being that, for a change this character was not undermined and belittled by his peers, but was seen as one of the 'popular' kids at school. Channing Tatum however, played a rather opposite character, once perceived as the good-looking 'jock', was shunned by the popular kids at school and resorted to becoming friends with the lesser socially prominent characters of the school.<br/><br/>Overall it was propa decent. I loled loads. Go and watch it. I IMPLORE YOU. IT IS VERY FUNNY.<br/><br/>IM SERIOUS IT WAS REALLY VERY FUNNY.<br/><br/>Movieman out."

","""21 Jump Street"" was probably one of the best movie adaptations I have ever seen. It was wildly funny, well written, definitely raunchy( but not over the too.) I was going into the movie theaters expecting a very funny time. And that's all I got ! And not your average comedy either; just jokes and a silly plot. No, this movie was amazingly funny, thanks to a brilliant cast, good script, and wonderful imagination, on how to make a 80's television show come to life on the big screen. The last great comedy of this magnitude was none other than ""The Hangover"". Jonah Hill also seems to prove his immaculate talent and promises that him in a good duo, has potential for the years best comedy. Anyone who watches this film, young or old, is guaranteed one of the best times in the theaters this year! Besides the comedy, this movie has good action and definitely no juvenile jokes; this movie is the ideal comedy. And also, to my surprise, Channing Tatum did a great job in the movie; a role I honestly didn't believe he could deliver, but did. Personally this movie was one of my favorite movies of 2012 so far"
"luke-693","9","0","4","1 April 2012"," Hilarious but not suitable for children
","When watching this movie, it was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. However, the language and sexual content are not suitable for children. At the theater, I witnessed at least a dozen children under the age of 12. Even one of the parent's said that they thought it was a mistake to bring their kids during the movie. However, they didn't leave. Strong sexual content is not suitable for these children. Please be aware parents of the subjective nature of this movie. After watching, I felt the sexual parts were added and were oddly inserted without cause or comedic relief. If they completely edited these parts out, the movie would have still be the funniest movie I have ever seen. Hollywood needs to get a clue that sexual immorality doesn't need to be in every story in order for it to be funny."

","Humorous, has a lot of cameos that some people totally don't understand, it's not like the original series but does give a lot of nods to the series (McQuiad brothers). Channing Tatum has the best lines ever, I don't think there was a minute where I wasn't laughing! Is set up for a sequel and set up well, actually. Jonah Hill's character is both socially awkward and adorable. You kinda wanna hug Schmidt all the time. Then of course, poor Jenkowell high school doesn't like him so then he's socially awkward and you really just wanna jump him and never let gowith the help of the dialog, you find out that Jenko isn't all hot to trot and has some worries regarding hilarious things. <br/><br/>Favorite Character: Korean Jesusand Jenko<br/><br/>Favorite line: I'm sorry I just can't sometimes. -Jenko<br/><br/>Favorite conversation: Captain: Since you love to drink booze, do drugs with kids, and f%^$ anything with a big ass in jeans, I'm sending you where all that is allowed.<br/><br/>Jenko: Oh f&#^, I love Disneyland.<br/><br/>Did it do justice to the original series? I will say yesit's a more modern approach to the series. When the original was released, cussing was not something you would see in the amount that you see in 21 Jump Street 2012 edition. Cameos of almost all of the original members really shined some light on the impact of the original j.s. crew. Plus, Jenko is Jenko's kid and everyone knows that Captain Jenko was everyone's favorite character. There are a lot of tiny nods to the original show that you see everywhere.<br/><br/>Would I watch the sequel? Yesespecially if it has the same cast because Jonah & Channing were amazing together."

"flamegamehunter","9","0","2","27 March 2012"," I loved it. It had me laughing through the entire movie.
","21 Jump Street. Now I've seen a lot of Jonah Hill movies, from Superbad to Accepted and Get Him to the Greek, but this one has to be one of his best. Though Superbad was basically the main movie you'll know him for, 21 Jump Street definitely can be another milestone in his career. Even though people have been standing by the whole, ""He was only funny because he was fat"" thing, Hill makes a great character. Channing Tatum also does a good job in the film, being the polar opposite to Hill in almost every way. I have only seen Tatum in The Vow, and I like him in that one too, being the big muscular guy with a big heart. Here, Tatum puts on a more silly, college student role and it suits him well, though he is huge and nobody would actually believe he is in high school.<br/><br/>The movie had me laughing pretty hard most of the time. You get a back-story for Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as they both fail at high school and become cops. Then things go bad one day on patrol and they get sent to do an undercover high school drug-bust because they look like kids in high school. The drug circling the school is called HFS, and Schmidt and Jenko have to find the supplier to stop it from getting to other schools. This gets ridiculous as we follow the duo's tactics for finding said supplier. One of which requires the both of them to actually take the drug and still try to focus whilst in class, and another results in a car chase across town in a pink Volkswagen buggy. The movie is pleasantly silly and had just the right amount of ridiculousness. Obviously stuff like this wouldn't happen in real life, but who goes to the movies to see real life? The only actual problem I had was with the love story that ensued between Schmidt and Molly Tracey (Brie Larson). Schmidt does look like he is in high school, but he graduated, as the movie suggests, in 2005. The movie is set seven years later, so Schmidt has to be at least 25 years old. Throughout the movie, he gets attached to Molly and ends up asking her to prom and making out with her, and this whole time I kept asking myself if a 25 year old would really do that with someone who is still in high school. It wasn't stated that Molly was graduating any time soon, so she could be 16 or 17 at that time. It's silly for that to bother me, but it did not in any way lessen the experience I had watching this movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion: The movie was great. The characters all worked well together. I liked them all and didn't get tired of anyone. The comedy wasn't just the same joke stretched throughout the entire movie, and it never got stale. Looking back, I keep chuckling at certain scenes from the film, and that's what a comedy is supposed to do. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Also, Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise make a hilarious return from their 1987 television series 21 Jump Street to this movie as the same characters, and I couldn't help but marvel at how awesome that was."
"MarcusJ13","8","0","1","27 March 2012"," Hilarious albeit in all the ways you've seen before.
","Looking at 21 Jump Street simply from it's promotional material it appeared to be just the typical cliché undercover cop comedy that we've seen before. Having watched it, is it? Well yes but it stands out for celebrating it for what it is and not insulting the audience. We have our two leads the good looking one and the typical nerd like fat one. They knew each other in school and couldn't stand each other, now they are friends as adults. Again not unusual in the slightest but the film succeeds in constantly throwing jokes that you don't really have too much time to notice the clichés. They go undercover the infiltrate a new drug craze in a school and inevitably they end up succumbing to the drugs at some point as well as enjoying themselves a little too much. There is of course the meta humour involved with mentions of 'an old program brought back from the 80's,' didn't get too much of a laugh in my particular screening but made me chuckle. And let's face it by the time you've sat down to watch you've only yourself to blame for not knowing what's in store. The film has decent performances from our two leads but in my opinion the stand out was Channing Tatum who just seemed to be more naturally funny in the role. However Jonah Hill's actions did bring more laughs at times. There is plenty of action and you more or less need to pay attention as there almost seems to fit in more jokes at these points to go along with the fast paced sequences. Other characters were decent and it was funny to see our leads attempt to fit in with the changed high school personalities from their days. This was where Channing Tatum particularly stood out. All in all it comes down to many things you see coming but learn to have fun with it enjoy the silliness and you may enjoy. It has beaten recent attempts at buddy cop comedies hands down."

","21 Jump Street is a brilliantly funny movie which I would absolutely recommend to anyone with a good sense of humor. Seeing an overweight Jonah Hill with bleached hair and white t shirt looking like Eminem, develop into a policeman on a bicycle kick starts this movie as funny from the get go.<br/><br/>Whilst I'm not that familiar with the TV Show this movie is a great date movie with enough of a love angle to keep the girls interested, yet never ending laughs for both males and females to enjoy. Some of the jokes may be overplayed, but this only adds to the comical value of the movie as a whole. <br/><br/>The movie plot is straightforward, set with two cops going undercover in a high school.One typical nerd from his era and one typical jock, these roles are quickly reversed in the new school setting. The story unfolds with a classic high school drama and love story backed up endless laughs. The key part of the movie is based around brotherly love after a much expected 'boys will be boys' fight. As the story moves on, the new drug they are assigned to investigate becomes the main focus. Ice Cube playing the commanding police officer adds more comical value to the movie every time he talks. <br/><br/>The cast involves some interesting choices with Channing Tatum not renowned for starring in funny movies; however he embraces the challenge well. But let's be honest the man who holds this all together is none other than Jonah Hill. Every so often an actor comes along that is genuinely funny; someone who you know as soon as you see them on the big screen they will have a long career. Jonah Hill is this man for me, he looks funny, talks funny even walks funny everything about him is funny. Ever since I first saw him in Superbad I knew he was something special. Doesn't matter too much who is on screen with him they are lucky to have him there. <br/><br/>This movie gets 4 stars out of 5 for me, a movie filled with great comical value and very entertaining.

","A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring.<br/><br/>Prologue: Sitting at home, nothing to do, the idea came up to see a movie. To narrow it down a bit; a comedy. I've seen the trailers to 21 Jump Street, and to be honest the movie looked like any other before. To be completely honest, I thought it looked pretty stupid. Nevertheless, with zero expectations, I went and saw the movie.<br/><br/>Review: 21 Jump Street is simply hilarious. I've never seen a film where every 5 seconds, there is someone cracking up in the theater. Everybody was enjoying their selves and I just have never been so entertained. Firstly, the comedy was genius, clever, comedic gold. The jokes were hit right on point, and each actor did a great job with their roles. That leads me to the actors. We've all seen Jonah Hill before, and it seems like he's a Seth Rogan clone that plays the same role EVERY SINGLE MOVIE. Thing is, the movie suits him, and he plays it well. The thing that EVERYBODY was worried about how Channing Tatum would play his role, especially how he's such a horrible actor. But this was his first role in a comedy, and everybody suspected the movie would suck with him. WRONG! He was great, hilarious, and I see a great comedic career ahead of him. The jokes and gags were straight up clever. I bet that there was one joke that someone did not catch because everything they say is so fast-paced and hilarious, that maybe their laughs made the next joke inaudible. They take a grab at pop-culture, the antics of high-school, and the world we live in today. The last thing I'd like to praise over is how great it was. Yes, the film does have it's flaws, but I simply rate this over how new and inventive it worked. It was downright hilarious, and had some classic scenes that'll win you over. The screenplay, the directing, and the cinematography were all great too, so the movie does deserve a 9/10... <br/><br/>Epilogue: I recommend this movie! Of course there will be people who will doubt this movie, because maybe they wanted more something, but I recommend to ignore them as well. The movie works in many levels and is thankfully something new. Don't believe me? The movie scores 7.7 on IMDb and a 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, the movie was great. Even if your not feeling it, the cameo by Johnny Depp is worth the price alone. 9/10."

"doink902000","9","0","4","24 March 2012"," It's a great movie
","I think this film is Awesome! The acting of the two lead guys is great for this type of movie. This movie really put the spotlight on how weird and backwards things are these days, when it comes to popularity in schools, how teens interact with each other, etc. Lol, had a nice, few, guest appearances from a few big name actors in it lol. The camera work was nice and the way they set it up for a part 2 was really cool. I honestly don't wanna write 'till 10 lines, so I'm going to be just saying stuff for the next few sentences. Jonah Hill is this generations Jim Carrey...really? Of course not. But again, I don't wanna write 10 lines of stuff for this movie."

","Having been a fan of now-almost-forgotten TV drama ""21 Jump Street"", the series that launched Johnny Depp's career, I was rather hesitant to attend a screening, yet, could not be happier that I went. The movie reprises the series' concept, yet, does it in a new, fresh way. Both Tatum and Hill sell their roles without a hitch. Hill, playing a typical high-school loser, is reincarnated as a high school jock due to a case of mistaken identity, while Tatum, the former jock and class underachiever, is too funny as no longer popular school nerd.<br/><br/>The entire movie is a series of sight gags, yet, the jokes are done intelligently and in good taste, without ever being a joke upon itself.<br/><br/>All in all, a great fun, with special treat of bit part appearance by Johnny Depp at the very end.<br/><br/>A ""must see"" for full blown belly laughs!"
"hantonr","9","0","4","23 March 2012"," Crying out loud laughs
","I went to see 21 Jump Street tonight after having a date to go see Hunger Games postponed for a few days. I figured, it has Jonah Hill, how bad can it be.<br/><br/>And it was amazing! Wow, there are only a few movies that I have laughed that hard at ever. As long as you're willing to chuckle at something like ""The Three Stooges"", you'll enjoy the comedy in this movie. Just when you think it can't get more ridiculous, it does just that. And Hill does an amazing job at making the audience laugh time and again.<br/><br/>Maybe not a ""family"" movie, but great fun for the teens-and-up crowd."

","This movie is for the adults the kids wouldn't understand, but i laughed my butt off, which is not very often because most movies these days are stupid humor, this movie will make you laugh because you seen or done some of these things, it will make you laugh because its just funny and it will keep you entertained. If you want to watch twilight type movies this isn't for you.<br/><br/>This was our alternative to hunger games, and this was a much better choice! There is action, there is Humor, there is stupidity. I love the Cameo with Johnny Depp, could stop rolling. I think they did a great job of pulling this story back from the dead, the plot followed well, and the captain well he was what he said he was!"

","I wanted to see this movie so bas first of all I love Channing and I gotta love Jonah now and more love for them a partners. When the movie started I was like eh..maybe not as expected. at first I was like too much cussing yo! Finally got why it was R rated. The first 10 minutes of the movie are just hilarious like super laugh. and then the story finally starts then you get the punches of laughters and it doesn't stop until the end. Channing and Jonah did awesome and reached my expectation. The only thing I didn't like was the cuss words when not needed. The story is great. It not like a typical go with the flow or twisted movie. The plot works great, there are great supporting roles and they give good laughs. Great watch with friends, definitely not with family."
"edwbur","10","0","3","23 March 2012"," funniest movie of 2012
","21 jump street was a delightful surprise for me, because i had little hope for this film. TV shows being turned into movies are like movies being turned into games. they don't turn out good. but 21 jump street went in the opposite direction, because they where so opposite from the show. they took something serious and turned it into a funny comedy with two of the fastest rising stars Channing Tatum, and Jonah hill. we start out when Schmidt (Jonah hill) and jenko (Channing Tatum) were in high school. jenko was the cool jock and Schmidt was the uncool nerd. jenko also bullied Schmidt. fast forward several years they end up meeting again at the same police academy. again jenko being the dumb one and Schmidt being the smart one. they end up becoming friends and having high hopes after graduating from the police academy with car crashes and all the stuff you see in movies they end up on bike patrol. the bust a drug dealer but the dealer is let go because jenko didn't read him his Miranda rights. leads to a very funny scene. and thats what this movie is funny. hilarious. with strong performances by both Jonah hill, and Channing Tatum. now Channing Tatum has been known as an untalented actor. but i disagree. he is an underrated actor. this film he was very very good. he got a lot of laughs as did Jonah hill. great chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah hill. and if you didn't know, johnny depp made a outstanding cameo performance in the film as the character he played from the TV show 21 jump street that he starred in and that made him a star. i knew that before the movie came out, because i am a huge, huge, huge fan of movies, TV shows, and wrestling. i know a lot about movies TV shows, and wrestling. back to the movie, this is a movie not to be missed. currently out in theaters. see it."
"DJRumpy","8","0","5","21 March 2012"," Surprisingly good
","I was a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I don't know if it's because i'm a bit older and remember the original, or it was just funny, but this was well worth the price of admission. <br/><br/>This one was a bit like a summer blockbuster a bit early. Not too deep on the plot, but just a lot of fun to watch. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum played off each other surprisingly well. The film does a good job of taking expected plot lines and turning them on their ear. It uses a good combination of sight gags, and situation comedy to very good effect.<br/><br/>In short, both Channing Tatus (Jenko) and Jonah Hill (Schmidt) are just bad at certain aspects of their chosen careers in law enforcement. They band together to shore up each others weaknesses and manage to just make things worse by dragging each other further down.<br/><br/>Great supporting roles by Dave Franco (brother of James Franco),and Brie Larson do an admirable job representing 'todays youth' while keeping things light. Also a surprise cameo from Depp.<br/><br/>This is a good film for the older set as it turns your expectations of high school upside down, and just generally pokes fun at high school life from today and 25 years ago.<br/><br/>See it. You won't regret it."
"goldwriting","8","0","3","21 March 2012"," Retro Remake Delivers Laughs Galore
","I was there. I remember the moment when this project got announced and I felt the familiar tearing of a piece of my childhood ripped violently from my past and stomped on the ground in front of me. We've been trained by a culture of recycled and rehashed content, making what was once hilarious into something kitschy and embarrassing, turning us into shell-shocked survivors of our own cherished memories. So to say the bar was set low for this would be an understatement of epic proportions, but that's where the creators get their edge, because there is nowhere to go but up. And they did.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street follows two former high school enemies who become best friends while training together in the police academy. They find themselves busted down into an undercover program specializing in investigating high schools. Assigned to root out the supply chain of a dangerous new synthetic drug, the two partners try to balance doing their job against the opportunity to re-live high school, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>One of the best things about moving something from the TV to the big screen (which may be one of the only things) is it can open up the latitudes of what those characters can say, do and get away with. How many times did you wish one of our 80s sitcom heroes would just drop that bad guy off the roof, saying ""Seriously, that guy deserved it."" 21 Jump Street recognizes that freedom and relishes it from beginning to end without making the classic mistake of overdoing it. They remembered the simple fact that there was a story still needing to be told in order to bring it all together. It's a delicate balancing act; expanding on the original TV concept, catering to the die-hard fans and making it enjoyable for the newcomers. The people at the helm were able to achieve it with apparent ease, but what may surprise some people is just who those people are: Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>Beyond starring in the film, and reportedly becoming best friends off- screen in the process, Hill and Tatum are listed as Executive Producers on the film. While that title holds many different meanings in Hollywood, from complete controlling interest in a project to just some guy with a checkbook who never even steps on the set, the fact that Hill and Tatum are listed I believe showed a surprising dedication to the project not common to the actors of their generation. Hill is also credited as co-writer of the story, which as I mentioned before, is an integral part of what made this remake a success. The balance between buddy comedy, coming-of-age, action and tempered sex comedy brought so many flavors to the table it was nearly impossible to walk out and say nothing on-screen actually made you laugh.<br/><br/>The cast choices were also spot on with current comedic favorites like Rob Riggle, Ellie Kemper and Nick Offerman. This trio shaped and smoothed out the comedic arcs when the main characters had to focus on actually moving the story along. Then comes two of the best cameos of all time: Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise, original cast members from the TV show. They bridged the gap between history and present day in an incredibly hilarious scene, which can only be seen to be fully appreciated. Not to be left out, fellow original cast members Holly Robinson Peete had a walk on in an early motor pool scene and Dustin Nguyen is actually on a TV in the background later in the film."
"Pumpkin_Man","10","0","6","20 March 2012"," One of the Best Movies of the Year!!!
","I still haven't watched the original series, but I absolutely loved this movie. This movie is more of a continuation of the series, and reboots the franchise. It was hilarious from beginning to end. I cannot stress enough how epicly awesome this movie is. It's filled with dirty jokes, car- chases, gun-play and action. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play Schmidt and Jenko. Schmidt was a nerd in high school, and Jenko was a dim-witted jock. Seven years later, they meet up again at the police academy. They become partners and assigned to park patrol. When they screw up, they are reassigned to a revived specialty division on 21 Jump Street. They must go undercover as high school students and stop a new synthetic drug from spreading to other campuses by finding the supplier. They get stuck in tons of hilarious situations. If you want the perfect buddy-cop comedy action film, you'll definitely love 21 JUMP STREET!!!"

This film though is not for small kids in my opinion. <br/><br/>Anyhow, i started off pretty much having semi good expectations for this film because i saw only the trailer.

"jdesando","Null","0","6","18 March 2012"," The boys aren't bad.
","""You are here because you some Justin Beaver, Miley Cirus lookin' muthas."" Captain Dickson (Ice Cube)<br/><br/>It would be easy to discount 21 Jump Street as just a reworking of The Other Guys in which mismatched, underachieving neophyte cops fight the bad guys. But I can't do it because Schmidt (Jonah Hill), the smart but homely one, and Jenko (Channing Tatum), the cute but dumb one, are credible comedians and bromantic partners. It may not be much like the original TV show of the '80's, but it has an easy-going charm sparked by the two leads.<br/><br/>They're posing as high schoolers trying to bust a drug operation. While the set ups are stock, with the undercover cops avoiding detection by trying to be cool to join the dealers, the interaction between Schmidt and Jenko is effortlessly endearing . They may get mad at each other, but you know they would take a bullet for the other. Hill underplays his usual nerdy persona, perhaps in sync with his slimmer physique, and Channing shows some subtle comic timing absent in almost all his previous films, most notably for me in The Eagle.<br/><br/>I must complain about the bloody ending, almost totally out of rhythm with the rest of the zany antics. Although such mayhem may be the result of drug dealing in any situation, here it seem unnecessary and shocking, making an uneasy segue to a celebration.<br/><br/>Yet that criticism does highlight the rest of the film's success in making a real action, bromantic comedy with likable leads. I welcome this relief from the uneven Project X, whose teen party is surreal next to the more realistic one in this film.<br/><br/>I write ""realistic"" with irony on my mind because none of these proceedings is realistic; otherwise if it were like real life, it sure wouldn't be funny."
"EmmaDinkins","8","0","5","18 March 2012"," Chix Chat on Film review: So much more than the TV show.
","I had low expectations for this film, which is very typical for me when a movie is made based on an old television series, especially so many years after the show is off the air. There have been some successes like Star Trek, and the complete antithesis in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But, I just figured that the funny scenes from the trailer were about as good as it gets. I was so misguided. There were so many zany happenings throughout 37 Jump Street (you'll understand when you see the film) that I realized I was laughing out loud or had a smile on my face pretty much from the Slim Shady beginning to the plug for a sequel ending. This film painted a picture of how a friendship developed for Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) from within the Police Academy to being partnered for the Jump Street project and it only took a few scenes for the audience to know exactly who these characters were and their history together. I liked that the development of their relationship to present day was not drawn out or made more important than it really was because once they became partners the story just got funnier and funnier. The overly exaggerated angry Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) aided my understanding of embracing stereotypes, the running joke of an impending explosion was both funny and exhilarating, and the whole Peter Pan play made for some of the funniest scenes in any comedy lately. Even though I knew from the trailer that there would be a mention of how old Jenko looked to be in high school, it was still funny when delivered in the film, since the real joke is that in many High School themed movies the actors are too old to play teenagers, here rather than ignore that fact it was embraced. There must be some very potent thespian DNA in the Franko family, Eric Molson (Dave Franko) was played to a tee as an overindulged neglected teen, but with the sensibility of today's biggest plight which is conserving our ecology. The revelation of how much High School has changed was also interesting to say the very least. I have to say until viewing the film I did not even realize DeRay Davis (Domingo) was in it, and before he said or did anything I was cracking up over his tats, you have to really be a bad, bad guy to have a bucket of tears. The only expectation I went into the film with was to see who would return in a cameo, that expectation was met and then some, especially to learn that someone could be right under your nose and you not even know it. I give 21 Jump Street a green light."
"awokurka","10","0","6","17 March 2012"," Best movie I've seen in a LONG time!
","I think this movie is hilarious and definitely worth seeing. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are a match made in comedy heaven and Tatum can play the humorous role surprisingly well for someone so often cast as a heart throb. It's been a long time since I've laughed throughout an entire movie but that was no problem with this one. My abs were hurting until the credits rolled! The plot was incredibly easy to follow but super interesting at the same time. I thought they did the original show justice by sticking to the basics and adding modern twists. The supporting actors and actresses we also hilarious and did a great job. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie -- it's one of the best movies I've seen in a very, very long time!"

Such as the drugs, clichés, ,world problems, etc. THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE A SPOILER <br/><br/>I was laughing most of the time though some jokes were not funny, but overall it was a fun time watching the movie with my friends. <br/><br/>I had to admit that some scenes didn't really stay in my head for so long and is not entirely super memorable compared to the juggernauts from years. However, this was a remake and I personally think is one of those movies that are better than the ones in the theatre at the moment. If you get the chance to see it, go see it.<br/><br/>7.8/10"
"kdorsey321","8","0","5","17 March 2012"," Funny as expected
","Checked out the movie ""21 Jump Street,"" starring Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Ice Cube. This movie is about two guys that were not cool with each other in high school, but ended up being best friends, as they got older though helping each other become cops. When they became cops they ended up having to team up to stop a high school drug lord from selling illegal drugs to students within the school.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is as funny as you expect it to be. I will admit that I was scared that the only funny parts would have been the parts we seen in the previews, but that wasn't the case in this film. Just about everyone that participated in this movie gave you something to laugh about. This movie was funny pretty much the whole way though. You could tell they had a great time filming this movie. This movie wasn't just funny, it also has an enjoyable plot that wasn't over the top. The plot fit very well and the extra character in this movie made sense. This movie is a ""great time"" for a hour and a half.<br/><br/>Even Channing Tatum was funny. I point him out specifically because it was a little hard for me to see him playing a funny role in a film. Being though in other movies he usually played a more serious role. Besides that, look at him. He doesn't quite strike you as the person that is going to make you laugh. All in all, he has some parts that were pretty funny. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt like this was a movie that was meant to be funny. I felt as though this was a movie that you wanted to escape life for a hour and a half and just laugh as much as you could, and this movie provides that. This movie has good laughs, good plot, and its a good movie! I give the movie the rating of 8 out of 10."
"samuellop10","9","0","6","16 March 2012"," A very fun movie.
","This movie was hilarious! I do not want to come out sounding too carried away, but, it was a really good movie. I do not remember laughing this much in a theater for a long time. I would not recommend it to everyone as everyone has different tastes, but, if you like a movie with good comedy and action you will definitely enjoy it. It should be noted though, that this movie has some mature subject matter, so I would not recommend it to kids and younger audiences. <br/><br/>If you already know the plot, just skip to the next paragraph. This movie is basically about two cops who, in high school, did not get along at all. Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) was a nerd, and Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) was a jock. Due to this Jenko would think that it was funny to make fun of Schmidt a lot. 7 years later they find themselves applying to the same place to be cops. Jenko finds it difficult to pass the written tests during their training, and Schmidt finds it difficult to do the physical tests for the training. So they decide to be friends an help each other out. Then they both pass training and become official cops. After they try and fail to bust someone for drugs (to get assigned to something more exciting than park-duty watch), they are assigned to go undercover in a high school, since they are both young-looking, to find the supplier of a new drug, and it is after this that most of the events in the movie unravel.<br/><br/>Both Tatum and Hill did an excellent job playing partners and the undercover cops at the high school. The jokes and other funny moments came out very naturally and not forced at all thanks to them. The same can be said about the action sequences, though people should not expect it to be straight-forward action, this movie is more about the comedy. Also the plot was very nicely carried out throughout the movie within the comedy context.<br/><br/>In short, if you want to have a really good time with your friends, keep a fairly open mind and go watch this movie. You will not regret it."
