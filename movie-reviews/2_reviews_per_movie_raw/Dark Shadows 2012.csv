","Tim Burton is probably one of the best choices to direct a Dark Shadows movie. He's always good at making Dark, Gothic films and everyone's expecting it to be something like Sweeney Todd and Sleepy Hollow. Instead, it has a hybrid of Corpse Bride and Beetlejuice. It begins with decent gloominess but the rest is scattered with groovy soundtrack and colorful images. But that may not be the problem. It's actually pretty good at recapturing the 70's. The main problem is the plot development. It's fun but also disappointing.<br/><br/>It looks promising in the beginning. Tim Burton uses his campy directing style which made the intro intriguing. It get silly when Barnabas returns from his grave. Exploring the changes of his town. It's quite funny and delightful. There's a good character development in this that made it entertaining. Johnny Depp gives a delightful performance as Barnabas Collins. Eva Green is quite menacing as Angelique. Jackie Earle Haley and Helena Bonham Carter are the extra comic relief. Chloë Moretz is always good at bad girl roles.<br/><br/>There's a lot of fun going on, but in the end, the experience feels like something's missing. It could have been an interesting story but it ends pretty lazy. There are couple of senseless twists that aren't consistent. At least there is something good in the filmmaking. The production design is quite decent and sometimes unlikely colorful. Postmodern music are played often which made Danny Elfman's music score hard to notice. But these merits can't fix the film's storytelling.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is undeniably entertaining and nothing else. There are things that could have been better. I don't think the colorful groovy look is the problem. It just needs a better ending that gives consistency to the story. People can still give it a try for its camp. There's a true vampire here that is nothing like our modern vampires. Dark Shadows is not bad. It's just unsatisfying. It has the color, life, and all but what's missing is a proper plot development."

","With the admonition, ""I never liked the bitch anyway,"" the Willie character in the new DS dispatched my favorite Dark Shadows character, pretty much summing up Depp and Burton's apparent opinion of her. For me, Dark Shadows was about Julia and Barnabas. Their chemistry created the dynamic that made the show work for me. I'm not only a first- generation DS fan, I'm the co-author of the Dark Shadows Companion. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp, supposedly a first-generation fan, even though he's two years younger than I am and I'm supposedly very young for a first generation fan, apparently thinks Barnabas Collins is part moral icon, part victim of his crotch. I wonder if Depp was watching the same series I was. As much as I loved the original Barnabas, I see no trace of the character in his interpretation. Frankly, the minute he murdered Julia, the whole movie collapsed for me -- the implied oral sex scene was bad enough, but the killing finished it. In the House of Dark Shadows big-screen remake this was accepted by fans because the series was still on-going. Depp does not have that salvation.<br/><br/>I really don't care that she's alive for the sequel. I doubt there will be a sequel. If there is, it's still not the characters I grew up with. <br/><br/>However, we're supposed to be reviewing what the film is, not what it's not. What it is, is an overstuffed suitcase that somebody sat on in order to zip it shut. It spills out all over everywhere. The cohesiveness is forced. The characters are largely unrecognizable. As I watched the film, I was at first taken by the wonderful graphics, but Collinwood seemed to morph into Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.<br/><br/>There are some good performances, it's occasionally slightly funny, it's graphically intense and interesting, but Depp and Burton seem to have nothing but contempt for the original series. I'm sorry, but flawed and bad as it could be, Dark Shadows was still far more compelling on its tiny budget than this movie was with its huge one.<br/><br/>What a shame -- and a waste. I really wanted to like it."

","Lets be frank. If you had a dime for every time Hollywood took something dusty and old, and tried to turn it into something shiny and new, you could retire.<br/><br/>In fact, most of these attempts barely work. But (having seen this one front to back three times since its first release) I believe this is an exception and moreover I believe that viewers have become so jaded to these attempts that they instinctively rebelled against the film (hence the low rating) without even giving it a chance.<br/><br/>The script by Seth Grahame-Smith is witty and clever and engaging. And wonderfully demented. The cast is to die for. Eva Green and Johnny Depp are at the peak of their craft, delivering with a straight face bits of dialog that lesser actors would choke on. The supporting cast (almost all A-list with a young Chloë Grace Moretz) is rock solid.<br/><br/>Overall a delightfully deranged yet still entertaining exercise in being silly -- which is exactly what Hollywood aims for in these odd exercises.<br/><br/>The IMDb rating is much too low. Give it another chance."

","Just got back from an early screening of the movie. As someone who like Johnny Depp, I was excited to watch the movie, but nearly ended up walking out of the screening halfway through the movie. There are hardly any entertaining moments, an extremely weak plot, and some very average acting. Sure, Johnny Depp may be a brilliant actor, but there's only so much an actor can do to salvage an immensely boring film. The weak development of the love story, limited exploitation of what could have been some interesting time-travel anachronisms and absurd additions to the plot (like ghosts and werewolves who remain mute spectators throughout the movie only to appear at the very end) were insulting to the intelligent movie-goer.."
"rannynm","10","51","79","29 October 2012"," Surpassed My Expectations
","The film Dark Shadows opened to an eagerly awaiting audience of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans. Based on the ABC daytime show which aired during the late 1960s which generated a cult following, what was taken seriously in the late 60s / early 70s comes across as comedy today. The majority of the movie is set in 1972 and incorporates music from the Moody Blues (Nights in White Satin) with appearances by Karen Carpenter in a TV scene, a cameo appearance by Alice Cooper and appearances by four of the original Dark Shadows actors including Jonathan Frid who passed away shortly after filming. Rated PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content , drug use, language and smoking, one of our 14-year-old critics, Raven Devanney rated it 6 out of 5 stars for ages 13 and up. Here's her take: Dark Shadows Reviewed by Raven Devanney http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2NE6UPSLcM Dark Shadows is a hilarious movie about a man named Barnibus Collins, who is cursed by an evil witch when he refuses to give her his love. Turned into a vampire, Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now, freed by unsuspecting construction workers, Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family, restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch, Angelique, who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp, who plays Barnibus Collins, did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton, you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films, but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's. The special effects were great too, especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack; she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One; she is my favorite young actress, two; she played a moody, mellow dramatic, angsty teenager perfectly. The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over- acting, but not in a cheesy way, it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations, mild drug use and language. I would give this film 6 out of 5 stars because it far surpassed my expectations!"
"cliffcarson-1","3","193","329","11 May 2012"," DULL with little bite. Depp is playing dress up
","Oh the possibilities that were missed here. Except for the character names and a similar architecture in the house this film bares very little resemblance to DARK SHADOWS. The movie starts out beautifully and then goes off in so many awkward directions that it never finds what kind of movie it's trying to be. A few scattered laughs here and there do not compensate for a poorly conceived story that meanders itself to the point of being dull and confusing. What can you say about a movie that only comes to life in it's montages set to a pop songs from the early 1970's? Depp doesn't even attempt to capture any of the guilt ridden angst of Barnabas Collins. His Barnabas is a trick or treat Pirates of the Caribbean, very much like a kid playing dress up on Halloween and with two emotions, upset and more upset. Film has some nice set pieces but Burton doesn't bring any true Gothic feeling or sense of dread to the surroundings. The script has that throw everything up against the wall and see what sticks feel to it. Burtons direction comes off in a conveyor belt ""okay, let's shoot this one"" tone with interest only in visuals, which are striking. He's really more of a visual artist than he is a film director. Indeed, one gets the feeling that this film would never have been made if not for Johnny Depp and his love for the original series which is evident here. It's unfortunate that he relies too heavily on make up to carry his performance. Helean Bonham Carter has no interest in being in the film and it shows, doing it only as a favor to her husband. Eva Green is the type of actress Tim Burton is attracted to and loves to cast in his films, but she possesses little of Angelique's spellbinding jealousy. The only one in the cast that has a hint of what these surroundings should be played like is Michelle Pfeiffer. She is the Grande dame of Dark Shadows capturing both the Gothic feel of the original story and the magnificence of the character."

","Time Burton scores again. This show is great and I will be getting it when it comes out on Blu-ray.<br/><br/>This is NOT a remake of Dark Shadows. It's a funny tongue-in-cheek spoof in the lines of Burton's Alice in Wonderland. As a die-hard fan of the TV series I can honestly say this is just a lot of fun. Depp is great and the rest of the cast was well chosen. Even the music, which is all of the 70's era, is perfect for the movie. Alice Cooper's appearance was a blast and fit in well. There are twists everywhere and it doesn't matter if you catch them or not. I bet you'll miss a few. LOL <br/><br/>Go see the movie. Don't over analyze it is, just enjoy it.

"wewatchedamovie1","4","306","554","11 May 2012"," Tired formula and a disappointing movie
","Let's leave it all at the door here. I loved Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman. Hated Batman Returns, Alice in Wonderland, and Willy Wonka. Could care less about Nightmare before Christmas and Sweeney Todd. Okay, so I'm not a Tim Burton hater. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. I think in this situation, I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda, no attachments. That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and ""showiness"" kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up. So much talent is wasted on these films having the same look, cast, and feel to them. Take that talent and make something fresh! Stretch yourself just a tad out of that Hot Topic comfort zone will ya? This movie was long, boring, and ruined. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer. By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's. That's bad film making whether your name is Tim Burton or not."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","3","99","169","2 September 2012"," Dark Shadows (2012)
","I saw every Tim Burton film since Mars Attacks! at the cinema. Until this came along. I had had enough of Burton's subpar efforts over the years and Alice In Wonderland was his last chance as far as I was concerned. Finally saw this and I'm glad I waited. This is simply awful. Based on a soap opera, Burton doesn't seem to know what to do. It changes tone dramatically from obvious humour involving Depp's character waking up after 200 years of being buried and being confused by things such as television. To grisly kills where he takes out innocent victims. There are a whole cast of characters, each one is given their own story, but none of them are given enough time to develop. Miller, Carter, Heathcote are all wasted as are their stories. I didn't even get the point of Miller, which is a shame because he was great with what he had. Entire scenes have no place in the film, or are needlessly long and repetitive. The main plot seems to have Eva Green asking Depp to be hers and him rejecting her, over and over and over again. It really does feel like snippets from a soap opera condensed down. This is really just a clip show. By the end it starts pulling things out of its backside. Couldn't care for anybody in this film and think the original property should have just been left alone."

"msmith5484","4","86","146","9 May 2012"," Johnny Depp vanity piece
","This movie is nothing but an excuse for Johnny Depp to put on make up and clothes and play a foppish character. He does it well, great in fact, but that's not a reason to make a movie. This was very much a disappointment. Too much happens too quickly and other things happen without much thought. Characters are not defined and Michelle Pfeiffer and Jackie Earle Haley are wasted. We have a vampire, witch, ghosts and a werewolf and not much scare or many laughs.. a few chuckles at the 'fish-out-of-water' aspect, but ""Austin Powers"" was funnier and more poignant. I didn't understand the motivations for any of the characters except the witch who curses Barnabas to be a vampire... he essentially uses his servant girl for sex then falls in love with another woman, no wonder she wanted revenge. This was a disjointed piece of distraction. Barnabas kills a bunch of construction workers, which has some scares, then he kills hippies, for laughs. He complains that killing is destroying his soul, but we don't see any reason to believe that. The sets and costumes are excellent as is the cinematography. The only thing missing is a well thought out story. The final shot suggests a sequel... which would be a curse."
"mombot","9","102","176","8 May 2012"," Barnabas Collins is a real vampire
","Dark Shadows is one of the 5 films I have been eagerly awaiting to see this summer and was very excited when I got a pre-screening pass to see it just a day ago. (I've seen The Avengers, too, so that's already 2 out of the list.) After seeing it last night, I couldn't decide what I thought about certain elements of it until this morning. When a film stays in my head, I know it's made an impression and again, Tim and Johnny have done just that. I can ""replay"" most of the movie in my head. Everyone is the way you'd expect their character to be and they are all excellent in their roles. They've made a film that will appeal to a wide range of audiences. When Barnabas hypnotizes someone, you believe he's doing it. Johnny is amazing, again! The sex scenes, such as they are, imply rather than show anything, but the expressions on Barnabas' and Angelique's faces tell you a lot. The story is (ahem) fleshed out rather nicely as everything is explained in due time and you're not hit over the head with stupid jokes. There is a good balance of humor and drama and even a bit of sweetness when Barnabas is with Victoria Winters (but not the kind that is sappy). Barnabas does reveal who his to Elizabeth but how this transpires and what it leads to is interesting and not played for laughs. Michelle ""gets"" Elizabeth and even her false eyelashes are a nod to the original TV show actress' look. The costumes! Colleen Atwood has done it again. 'Nuf said. There are Sleepy Hollow-like elements in the use and look of the blood, the horror elements (like when he kills) and can I mention the fangs? They come out when he's about to dine. They're marvelous! I will probably see this again with some friends as I'd like to see Dark Shadows in IMAX because, heck, IMAX is wonderful. My recommendation: Go see it! 9/10"
"earlytalkie","5","92","158","11 May 2012"," OK if you haven't seen the older versions
","I am a huge fan of the old Dark Shadows shows. I liked the old series, bloopers and all. I liked the films House of Dark Shadows and to a lesser degree Night of Dark Shadows. I liked the 1991 revival series of Dark Shadows. This new Tim Burton/Johnny Depp version has some good elements in it, like the costumes, soundtrack and special effects, but the problem here lies in the written word. The script relies too much on gags, some funny and some rather lame. The basic characters are mostly here with the exception of the melding of Maggie Evans into Victoria Winters, and the actor playing Willie Loomis does a better job with the character than did the one from the 1991 revival, who chose (or was directed) to play the role as a half-wit.(The one element I disliked about the revival). The 1970s music, cars, costumes and hairdos are spot-on and add to the comfy 1970s feel of the piece. The climax is all special effects and one ""revelation"" of the plot is so absurdly done here that it is (unintentionally) laughable. In all, I would say that this film may appeal more to those who never saw any of the original versions of this than the fans of them. I didn't hate this film, I just didn't love it either."
"peryteran2","4","237","446","9 May 2012"," Keep these two away from each other
","The film can't decide whether it's a fish-out-of-water comedy or a Gothic thriller/romance. Instead, we get treated to a bipolar movie that is, at times, really funny, but mostly full of unnecessary exposition. I think Burton wanted to honor the TV show by adding in so many details, but frankly, it was boring at times as they moved from one plot point to another. Some of the ""wrap up"" surprises at the end came off as forced. Though I'm glad they didn't rely on as much CGI to create the set pieces, one major scene involving a concert looked like it was stolen from the Austin Powers films.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp did some great physical comedy as well as Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley, but Dark Shadows should go back to the grave."
"mntwister","1","51","92","18 May 2012"," Absolutely great opening scene, then terrible!
","Warning: a few spoilers but nothing about the ending: I have been a fan of Dark Shadows since the days of the late 1960's and running home from school to catch the show when I was 9. I tried to go into this with an open mind. I promised myself that I would realize this was not going to be my beloved Dark Shadows but hopefully something of value to see. The entire opening sequence, where young Barnabas leaves for the United States to the building of the Collinwood estate to Josette's jump off of widow's hill had me cheering in my seat-YES this was going to be fantastic (though all of the opening storyline was terribly rushed, including Angelique putting the curse on Barnabas).<br/><br/>Then Johnny Depp (Barnabas) was released from his coffin in 1972. And from that point on, which was most of the movie really, I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I had ever seen. I find it very hard to believe that Depp and Burton were also kids like me who ran home to see the original series. Why did they take this direction? I mean panties on Barnabas' face in his coffin? Carolyn saying ""Yeah I am a werewolf, get over it"" when the entire movie we knew nothing of her being a werewolf? I was never so ashamed of Burton and Depp like I was today.<br/><br/>The original cast members are there, for about 2-3 seconds, walking into a party, and in the background again for 2 seconds for a shot. They were flown to England to do cameos. For 2-3 seconds? I mean, come on! And the humor, some jokes were just plain awful.<br/><br/>If Burton and Depp had taken the route they took with Sleepy Hollow, this could have been one of the best stories in film this year. If they had stayed with the feeling one got in the first 7 or 8 minutes,this could have been an absolutely fantastic horror movie. Instead it not only insults (rather than respects) Dark Shadows fans, but it completely loses that great feeling that was there for the opening sequence, which I loved, when Depp is telling the history of the Collins family.<br/><br/>I was turned off by the rock music at the very end, why not have all the credits playing some of the original Dark Shadows music, and why couldn't Danny Elfman interweave the main theme of the original into his music somewhere. Instead, the action scenes had that ""Mars Attacks"" opening credits type score, which I do love, but not here. The opening credits, instead of a good horror score, had the Moody Blues? Geeeez! And Alice Cooper at a party given by the grand Elizabeth Stoddard? Unbelievable. I think someone like Glen Close or even Judy Dench would have played a better head of Collinwood, Phiffer was just too young even though she did a decent job and tried, but all she had were bad lines to work with. <br/><br/>Barnabas not having to sleep during the day in his coffin, but using a hat and umbrella with dark glasses to keep out the sun and the light? And couldn't Burton take a break from all the white faces again (and again and again)?<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that some 18% of people gave this a 10. I guess these must be under 18. I can assure you than anyone who knows anything about the original Dark Shadows did not give this a 10. Why didn't they just make a vampire movie and leave Dark Shadows out of it and let someone make a real Dark Shadows film? If you want to see what Dark Shadows was and why it was so beloved, see the original film from MGM with the television series cast, ""House of Dark Shadows."" I hear Warner is going to release it at the same time they release this new piece of junk on video."

The central story (actually there is no perceptible central story !!) is so badly handled ....this may go down in history in the cult genre of ""one of the worst movies of all time"". This really is Ghastly Gothic Garbage. Tim Burton always gives us lots of heavily made up actors, bad scripts and good looking sets.

","I guess I will start out by saying that I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and that I even like some of Tim Burton's works (Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas). However, that being said, I did not like this film all that much. If you are looking for some comedy in this film, then go and watch the trailer, because most of the funny parts are in it. I understand that this film was supposed to be a spoof of the soap opera that appeared in the 1970's, but it really fell short of my expectations. I remember being in elementary school and rushing home to see what was happening on Dark Shadows. In this film, not only did I not want to see what happens next, I really didn't care. Johnny Depp (Barnabas Collins) once again embraced his character and does a really fine job of making the character believable, but the content just wasn't there. I don't think that this film ever decided what it wanted to be when it grew up. There were elements of comedy, horror, drama and even a little romance. There was some jostling around in this film between Barnabas and Angelique (Eva Green), but you could almost sense the wires that the actors were tied to. And is it just me or does Bella Heathcote (Victoria Winters/Josette DuPres) look a little like Anne Hathaway? Victoria and David Collins (Gulliver McGrath) gave a whole new meaning to the phrase ""I see dead people"". I guess my favorite character in the film was Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) who was Barnabas' sidekick. He was fun to watch even though he did not have many lines (thank goodness). This film may end up sucking the life out of your expectations. By the time you get to the end of the film, things get downright silly and stupid. The last ten minutes of the film I kept thinking to myself .. oh brother. Also at the end of the film there was almost a hint of a sequel; man I sure hope not. Not all of the Depp/Burton collaborations have been successful and this is one of them. If you just want to see Johnny Depp on the big screen, then by old means go. However I think that this film should be locked in a box (redbox). As sure as my blood is red, so is the light for this film."

The boy staring in the hall: Damien from The Omen. And the 1970's soundtrack was second to none, starting with ""Nights in White Satin."" It was tacky, funny, a little scary, and definitely another Burton hit. I would go see it again in theaters, watch it every time it is on T.V., and go see the sequel too.

","Now, I grant you, I was not an avid viewer of the adventures of Barnabas Collins in the 60's, although apparently every girl in my high school was. But I doubt that melodramatic soap had much relation to the film I saw, other than the names of the characters and the ever present scene of the waves crashing upon rocks on the New England shoreline. <br/><br/>Small matter. The film I watched was funny, spooky in a predictable sort of way, and the story was fresh. Depp once again creates a strange and unusual persona as Barnabas Collins, at once both the vicious, blood thirsty vampire and the refined gentleman of the 16th century. There are so many elements combined, the jeweled necklace reminiscent of Bela Lugosi's Dracula, the darkened eyes, the long claws of the Nosferatu, and Depp's uncanny ability to pull all these elements together to give us a comedic and enjoyable character we cannot help but like. Michelle Pfeiffer was an excellent choice as the current head of the family, a sturdy, refined and resilient woman determined to hold her head up despite the fallen state of the once powerful Collins family. Eva Green as Angelique is marvelous in her role as the evil yet business savvy woman whose only goal in life is the continuing destruction of the Collins family and reputation. The children, played perfectly by Chloe Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath, present the internal conflicts of the Collins, Carolyn who comes off as a very typical teenager, and David, who speaks frequently with his dead mother. Bella Heathcote, who portrays both Victoria in the present and Josette in the past, is also an excellent actress, and gives us just enough weird to balance the prim and proper appearance she first presents.<br/><br/>Of particular note is Helena Bonham Carter and her role as the doctor. The blatant comic relief she provides once again demonstrates her ability and depth as an actress, and one can easily see why Burton and Depp apparently enjoy working with this talented lady.<br/><br/>Overall, the film grabs your attention and keeps it throughout. The dialog is entertaining to the extreme, and the photography and cinematography is exceptional, as one would expect of anything from Mr. Burton. <br/><br/>Rated PG-13 due to the language and violence, as well as several references to sexual situations, I think this film will add nicely to any collector of the trio's work. I have one on order as soon as they are released."

She finds a dysfunctional family composed by the devoted matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) ahead of the family business that is near bankruptcy; her rebel daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloë Grace Moretz); her brother and David's father Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller); the psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) that takes car of David; and the servants Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley) and Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley). <br/><br/>When eleven workers release and awake Barnabas, he drinks their blood and returns to Collinswood.

","It's intriguing that a film which features - literally - sex, drugs and rock and roll (along with plenty of blood, gore and monsters) can run out of steam in the second half and result in one of the least favorably-rated Tim Burton-Johnny Depp collaborations since ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and the abysmal ""Alice In Wonderland.""<br/><br/>The whole idea of taking the first Gothic soap opera (which ran from 1966-70), a tale of vampires, horror and longtime family curses, and putting it on the big screen, at first seemed a stretch; but when director Burton decided to travel the comedic route, many fans and less-interested folks alike were even more skeptical.<br/><br/>I, too, had doubts, having actually seen the television show (I was very young, but remember the creepy opening theme music) and thought making this sort of a fish-out-of-water ""Brady Bunch Movie"" thing was a bit absurd. Then, I saw the preview and - for the first half, was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It begins in Liverpool in 1752, when the Collins family, dad, mom and young son, Barnabas, immigrate to the United States and settle in Maine. There, they establish a fishing business and soon are the richest people in Collinsport. As a young man, Barnabas (Depp) woos a scullery maid, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green, ""Casino Royale,"" ""The Golden Compass""), but refuses to marry (or even acknowledge his love for) her.<br/><br/>Ticked, as ANY woman would be under these circumstances, she uses her substantial witchcraft powers to cause the death of his beloved fiancée, turn him into a vampire and have the townspeople bury him alive. Almost 200 years later, a construction crew inadvertently unearths the coffin and Barnabas now must face life in 1972.<br/><br/>These scenes are easily the movie's best, as he tries to deal with the trappings of modern society; the sights, sounds, technology and mores. He then locates his ancestral home and discovers that it is now inhabited by the remains of his depressing, downtrodden descendants.<br/><br/>These include Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer, ""New Year's Eve""), her brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller, ""AEon Flux,"" the television series ""Dexter""), her daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz, ""Kick-Ass,"" ""Hugo""), Roger's son David (Gulliver McGrath, ""Hugo""), a meek governess, Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote, ""In Time""), an alcoholic caretaker, Willie (Jackie Earle Haley, Academy Award-nominated for ""Little Children), a senile old maid, Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley) and a drunken live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street"").<br/><br/>Over the past two centuries, the accursed Collins family has not only fallen out of favor with their namesake town, but has fallen into despair and near poverty, as well. Their only assets being a broken-down cannery and a few feeble fishing boats. Meanwhile, Angelique is still alive and controls most of the fishing fleets in the town, and is rich beyond imagination.<br/><br/>Using a hidden treasure trove, Barnabas restores the Collins' wealth and prestige, which sets up the conflict in which Barnabas battles his former trollop for control of his business, his soul and his family legacy. His efforts to fight this imposing demonic figure and to continue to get used to things in the seventies, spark some genuine laughs, as does his initial introduction to the ridiculous household.<br/><br/>Things begin to go South, however, when there are several real (and not very funny) killings; hey, Barnabas IS a vampire, after all, and he NEEDS blood. It's just most of these characters were actually interesting (including a group who just wanted to help him out of a tough situation). The inclusion of these mass murder scenes was not charming or darkly-humored, just disturbing.<br/><br/>Then, there is the introduction of a few supernatural monsters that turn up, muddle the conclusion, present really lame and not-so-special effects and end up not resolving much of anything.<br/><br/>And while Depp remains true to his Willy Wonka/Jack Sparrow/Michael Jackson motif character hybrid he seems to have established in recent efforts, Burton's quirky and slipshod direction has never been more evident - or glaring here. <br/><br/>The only thing I can write about this picture that was consistently terrific was the soundtrack. From ""Nights In White Satin"" to ""Bang a Gong,"" to ""Theme From 'A Summer Place,'"" to ""My First, My Last (My Everything)"" to ""Crocodile Rock"" to ""Top Of the World"" to ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" (as sung by Alice Cooper in an amusing cameo), these tunes - while not ALL from 1972 - still had me humming along and enjoying the show.<br/><br/>I just wish the rest of the film would have had the same effect on me."

","I love Johnny Depp and I love Tim Burton. Together they can be sublime. Look at ""Ed Wood"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" Here, well here they seem kind of lost. Everything is in over the top tones without getting to the root of anything. The performances are shrill and disconnected with the exception of the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. The script is underwritten and the story is tired and unconvincing but in the present film going landscape it is more enjoyable than most others. I'm tempted to advise Mr. Burton and Mr.Depp to be a bit more daring in their intentions. We're all aware of Burton's visual wizardry and of Depp's remarkable beauty and talent, why not put all that at the service of something meaningful?"

","While I can forgive Tim Burton a great many INSTANCES of narrative sloppiness, because he is FAMOUS for being a ""style over substance"" kind of storyteller, this film is a unmitigated failure on almost every level, and if there is justice in the world, should end the partnership of Burton and Depp. And, why? Because:<br/><br/>1. Barnabas is a weak protagonist. He is presented, in the wholly unnecessary prologue, as inheriting wealth. He doesn't desire ANYTHING. They say he preserved the Collins fortune, but we don't see it. We see him making vague, shallow, investigations into The Dark Arts, but we never see anything come of it. (for example, Mephistopheles is not the name of the Devil. Neither, incidentally, is Azazel, Adramelech, Aschema, Beelzebub, Belphigor... These are all names of demons. And I am no student of the dark arts, by any means. I'm just a researcher, at best).<br/><br/>Barnabas is merely a cold fish, who spurns a lover... who happens to have much more power than he imagines. And, too bad for him.<br/><br/>But, who is the protagonist, if not him? As near as I can tell, it's the witch. She's the plucky adventurer, who pulled her self up by her boot straps. She's the one with specific goals, and drive and passion. She's the one with the perfect breasts.<br/><br/>2. The story elements are muddled, with too much of everything, and not enough of anything. Element one: witchcraft. Element two: vampirism. Element three: seeing ghosts. Element four: lycanthropy. Element five: child neglect and abuse. Element six: seventies concerns like the president, the war, as well small town commerce and politics. Each element is mentioned in a slap-dash, superficial, referential way. They are not made to matter. <br/><br/>Any story problem is literally solved by 'hand-waving'. Barnabas needs a servant, so he wiggles his fingers, and voilà: loyal, slightly stupid, butler/chauffeur. He needs to hire a flotilla of fishing boats, and he overcomes the wise old captain with more or less exactly the same method of jazz hands/Nosferatu fingers. And nobody else seems to notice the shenanigans or care. (This is actually an epidemic in the film. The Good Doctor discovers there's a vampire in her immediate vicinity, and, yet, she is easily mollified with ""be fascinated"". Ol' Barny-boy lights himself on fire by standing in a sunbeam, and everybody kinda shrugs and moves along.)<br/><br/>3. Nobody... expects the Spanish Inquisition. Also, nobody says 'no' to Eva Green's breasts. They're like the two towers: YOU. SHALL. NOT. PASS! And, so you see how ham-fisted cultural references just isn't funny. Spoiler Alert: Alice Cooper is in the film. Spoiler Alert # 2: Alice Cooper is played by a dude named Vincent Damon Furnier. Spoiler Alert # 3: Barnabas thinks Alice is ""the ugliest woman ever"". This is an old joke. It's such an old joke, it makes you remember how young you were, when you first heard the joke... and then you get depressed about how old you are now. Referential humour is like salt, a dash gives you seasoning; a lot gives you a coronary. My chest hurts.<br/><br/>4. What does Barnabas want? Success and True Love. So he nips down to the larder, and rustles up some jewelry. How does that work, exactly? ""you want to refurbish your home? Nifty! We take cash, Visa, and rubies...""? We never see him working for his success. Rather, it just happens. And nobody seems to notice. Similarly, the way he goes about courting Josette 2.0 /Victoria-if-that-really-is-her-name leaves much to be desired. I've been in love a couple of times. Funny thing: the girl I FIRST fell in love with... I still think about her now. A decade later. I wonder how she is. I sometimes hear her voice on the breeze. And when I was still with her, well... I thought of nothing else. I ate and drank and slept her. Love was an all consuming passion. Barnabas rather forgets Whatsherface. He's too busy making clueless ""ball"" jokes that AC/DC made in 1976. And eating hippies, and who doesn't eat hippies? And killing the doctor (again, nobody goes, ""Hey, that perpetually drunk, quasi-somnambulist psychiatrist woman... where did she go...!?"").<br/><br/>How much better if he spent his time wisely, either menacing his sworn-enemy-who-locked-him-in-box-for-two-centuries... or wooing the lady he claims to love? But no. There's none of that. He even took time out of his (not very) busy schedule to hate-f**k his nemesis. At least that's what I think they were doing. They destroyed her office, but kept their clothes on. Not even a frond of his elegant Hipster-Gothic hairdo was out of place, after. And it was risible, and not at all erotic.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, if Eva Green professed undying love for me, and offered her undying body to me, I'm pretty sure I could play along, at least for a bit. But then, she hasn't killed my true love and my parents, and destroyed my family's name and business, or (oh yeah) locked me in a casket for two hundred years. So, there's that.<br/><br/>The problems of the film can be enunciated in two clear flaws. <br/><br/>1. When you consistently make style over substance films, you become a prisoner of your style. So, in the final scene, where Barnabas lies at the bottom of the cliff, with his now transformed-lover, I don't think, ""oh! How romantic!"". I think ""holy poop-skates! It's the chick from Corpse Bride!""<br/><br/>2. A vanity project almost always comes off as vain, even pointless. And who wants a pointless vampire movie?<br/><br/>In the end, I could have saved myself $31.50, and stared at a dreamy poster of Johnny Depp... Or that chick from Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>I give it two stars, one for each of Eva Green's arresting... eyes. (got ya!)"

","I was probably more excited than anyone when I heard a new Dark Shadows movie was going to be made. I was even more excited to learn Johnny Depp was behind it. WIth his clout in Hollywood, and his fan base, I knew the movie would get the needed financial backing and draw a crowd at the theaters. This was going to be great.<br/><br/>Then I heard Tim Burton was signed on. It never occurred to me, and I suppose it should have, that he would bring Tim Burton into the fold. Tim has done some great work - Sleepy Hollow is a favorite of mine, except the scene with the old witch who was a talking skull whose eyes and tongue popped out (stupid) this was a great film. Once I heard Tim was on board I knew the stupidity would commence and the film would be ruined. I really hoped Depp wouldn't allow ""Stupid Burton Tricks"" in this film. They were both supposed to be fans of the show. Clearly, they weren't. They just made the claim to win over TRUE Dark Shadows fans. It is unfortunate that Depp allowed Burton to ruin what could have been a great film. It's unfortunate Burton was ever signed on to the project.<br/><br/>The other reviews here give enough examples of the stupidity I refer to. I had hopes for new blood for Dark Shadows. A new future, with new stories. Now I can only hope we won't have to endure a sequel as well.<br/><br/>Thanks Tim for driving a stake through the heart of my childhood memories."

","Having been raised on the original Dark Shadows TV series and having seen the original dark shadows movie (btw, it was done MUCH better than this farce) I was disappointed... in the roles Jonny Depp and Tim Burton played in bringing this mockery to the theater. It bears VERY little resemblance to ANY of the original series or movie, and that resemblance is only in the names of the characters. <br/><br/>How a Gothic romance horror can be turned into this joke of a movie is beyond my ability to comprehend. there was no horror and very little ""goth"" or romance. I understand the need to ""modernize"" a movie to make it appealing to a different generation, but this is not modernization, it is butchery. Would you approve of the works of Shakespeare being butchered in such a way? The tell tale heart turned into a comedy with NO resemblance to the original work? No.. <br/><br/>My advice to all those who loved the original series OR the original movie? No not watch this, you will /wrists before the movie is even 1/2 way through. <br/><br/>And Tim Burton? Jonny Depp? I am ashamed and appalled to EVER call you great after what you did to this story..."

","From the trailer, I was expecting Tim Burton to re-conjure up his clever supernatural formula of his 1988's BEETLEJUICE. I knew that he was going to take a comedic direction as compared to the serious Gothic thriller versions of the 60s and 90s TV series . However, Burton failed to make this one work, much less a big screen version to the successful series. In fact, I would be so generous as to say that the trailer makes better sales pitch than the movie itself.<br/><br/>But apparently I was sheep enough to be deceived by its sly marketing.<br/><br/>Ghosts, witches, vampires and werewolves would certainly make good concoctions for an interesting supernatural movie premise after the recent splash of the superhero ensemble that was THE AVENGERS. But it seems that that was pure wishful thinking. I was bored to my bones and uninterested throughout the entire movie. I found myself practically praying when the movie is going to end as my focus was beginning to drain out.<br/><br/>On another level, it's quite plain to see that the Burton-Depp collaboration has been definitely been exhausted. I mean I should have seen the tell-tale signs that their so-called ""professional marriage made in cinema heaven"" had faded when they did the trying-too-hard screen version of the musical SWEENEY TODD. It seems like their last best project together would have to be SLEEPY HOLLOW and whatever they do afterwards seems to be forced. It's as if Hollywood itself is the mastermind that makes them keep up with the charades.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, it was Depp himself who jokingly hinted on E! that his collaboration with Burton seems to be failing like many Hollywood marital affairs. And it was proved a true revelation in this latest box-office bomb (to me, at least).<br/><br/>Like many others who flocked early to get the tickets, I was really anticipating a fun journey. Instead, all we got was an arid unimpressive trip into oblivion. I suppose those who among the lucky ones to have snapped up tickets to sold-out shows really deserved the junk that we saw on screen.<br/><br/>As colourful as the poster might have looked the only vibrance about DARK SHADOWS were the 70s costumes and Helena Bonham Carter's rich makeup. Even those did not feel authentic to the era other than tunes by The Carpenters.<br/><br/>I must say that it was a terrible waste of talents to be in this excuse of a ""dark comedy"". From Michelle Pfeiffer to the gorgeous Eva Green and cameos by Christopher Lee and the original ""Barnabas Collins"", Jonathan Frid (who passed on following the wrap-up). At the risk of sounding cruel I suppose his demise was probably due his disappointment Burton's treatment to his original series. And even Alice Cooper's presence did not particularly grace the film with his homage to the age of rock-and-rock of the 70s."

I am a fan of Johnny Depp. But my two favorite movies of his were Chocolat and Donnie Brasco. Both of these movies had absolutely nothing to do with Tim Burton. He is a very capable actor with the ability to play many genres. But I don't think he has explored his potential enough.

But still see him in daily sun but with a huge hat,umbrella and sunglasses. And at the end,there he is,saving a little boy,and running into sun.

"p-stepien","4","15","26","11 January 2013"," Burton spirals into shadows
","A featurised reimagining of a TV soap opera, Tim Burton returns with a gruesome dark comedy about a XIXth Century vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), the entrepreneurial creator of a fishing empire in the town of Collinwood, who is unwittingly released from his eternal coffin prison. His bloody urges must be quenched, hence blood splatters, but still Barnabas is an eternal with honour and a strong attachment to family ties. Hence he decides to live with his descendants in his family mansion, populated by Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), her daughter Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz), her brother-in-law Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), nephew David (Gulliver McGrath) as well as an assorted crowd of alcoholic psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley) and babysitter Victoria Wnters (Bella Heathcote). The latter bearing a remarkable resemblance to Barnabas's long departed beloved and ultimate cause of his accursed state. To his surprise the Collins fortune has largely fallen into disregard, whilst the town's fishing business is currently overrun by Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), the witch responsible for turning him into a vampire.<br/><br/>Admittedly an immense Tim Burton fan ""Dark Shadows"" is sadly his worst picture apart from ""Planet of the Apes"". Possibly revisiting the same actors has strained his ingenuity a bit, as well as caused the actors in force to go through familiar motions. As such Johnny Depp seems like a mold of other Depp-Burton characters, which is further not helped by the Depp and co's dry delivery of dry humour, which makes this dark tale thoroughly humourless. Knowing everyone in the cast is brimming with talent makes the overall dourness of proceedings even more striking. Depp seems emotionless beyond interest, Carter struggles to imbue any presence, Green is an empty if pretty shell, Haley barely registers, while Moretz comes off whiny and pretentious. The story wiggles around trying to bring together a coherent plot, but instead seems like a poorly glued together sequence of scenes of varying quality, which fail to either construct a story or instill any sense of affinity towards any on-screen character.<br/><br/>Conversely Burton's sense of glorious Gothic atmosphere is at its best with set designs and rummaging shots quintessential stuff and possibly some of the best in his career. However thrown into such a detached and pointless story it just seems like an immense waste of possibilities."

","I usually like the Burton/Depp combination, sometimes a lot, sometimes not so much, but this, I'm afraid, is very poor stuff indeed. I have no idea what Burton was aiming for, but the general ambiance is of a low-grade afternoon TV film aimed at the early-teen market. The female characters were straight out of ""Bewitched"", and many of the special effects were a mishmash of ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Death Becomes Her"" coated in the usual Burton eye-shadow (not intrinsically a bad thing, but now starting to look like last year's ""colourway""). There is no character or plot development, the film is neither scary nor humorous. Would uncritical twelve year olds like it? I don't know, but it's not for critical adults, that's for sure.

","While it had a bit of a slow start, with technical limitations being obvious and the characters not being as interesting, from the moment it switched to colour and introduced its most iconic character Barnabas Collins (unforgettably played by Jonathan Frid) the 1966 'Dark Shadows' is a classic.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why it was so popular back in its day, and it is equally easy to see why it is remembered so fondly now. Despite its flaws (which were forgivable in a way), this reviewer spent many days and hours watching it with sheer joy, it really helping me get through many stressful and mentally straining times this year at music college (though there were many great times too, and saw a huge progression and several seemingly impossible achievements).<br/><br/>Sadly, this 2012 film version of 'Dark Shadows' was hugely disappointing. As an adaptation of the show, it just doesn't compare and understandably can (and has been) be seen as a travesty to die-hard fans. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp apparently claim to be fans of 'Dark Shadows', but to me that wasn't obvious at all. There was more of a sense that Burton hadn't even seen the show, seeing as the tone and spirit feels completely wrong, or he thought he could improve upon it.<br/><br/>On its own as a film, it has its good points but several major flaws that to be honest for this reviewer were more obvious. It is a shame as I am a fan of Burton's 80s and 90s stuff, especially 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood' which are two of my all-time favourites, but after his career low-point 'Planet of the Apes' he became hit-and-miss. While it is better than 'Planet of the Apes', along with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' and 'Alice in Wonderland' 'Dark Shadows' is very much a lesser effort from Burton.<br/><br/>There are good things. It does look great, with splendidly Gothic and vibrantly colourful sets, wonderful and atmospheric use of colours, effectively ghoulish make-up and appropriately kooky costumes that suited the characters very well, while it's beautifully and stylishly photographed as well. The music score is groovy, rousingly orchestrated, haunting and a long way from forgettable or generic, if not one of Danny Elfman's best or most inspired scores, with some clever song choices. There are some amusing, well-written lines in the script, loved the line about Alice Cooper and it is most successful when Barnabas is struggling to fit in, and a few of the cast acquit themselves well.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is no Jonathan Frid and he has given better performances (though also much worse, it is one of his better performances in any of his later collaborations with Burton), but he is clearly having a lot of fun as Barnabas without overdoing it and is one of the most involved members of the cast, he also is very charismatic. Michelle Pfeiffer is one of the most successful at injecting a genuine and faithful personality, while Eva Green is both sexy and intense. Cameos by Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper are well-utilised.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a number of the cast don't come off well. Jackie Earl Haley, who is very good at being menacing and sometimes low-key if he needs to be, looked bored in a role that is so much in the background that there was almost no need for him. Helena Bonham Carter overdoes it and comes over as out of place, while Chloe Grace Moretz is irritating in a negatively stereotypical role. Much of the acting is either over-compensated and bland, being able to do very little to nothing with their dull and often unrecognisable in personality characters, and while it was interesting to see Frid his appearance is far too short to leave a lasting impression. The chemistry between the characters, one of the show's biggest strengths, is barely there.<br/><br/>'Dark Shadows' script has its moments, but these moments are too sporadic. Tonally it is very unfocused and muddled too often, it rarely seems to know whether to be eccentric comedy or full-blown melodrama. It attempts to do both (amongst others) and never completely succeeds at either, the comedy is too sporadic and can be childish and overdone and the melodrama is unmoving and overwrought. Story-wise it's a mess, it never really comes to life, has twists that come out of nowhere and are completely misplaced (especially the werewolf subplot), parts that drag endlessly and contribute very little to the plot and parts that looked alright on paper but executed in a half-baked way.<br/><br/>As a result, the Gothic atmosphere is almost completely lost, with it only being obvious in the production values, while the sex scene choreographed to Barry White is too broad and overly-wild and the ending is overblown to ridiculous extremes. Burton's direction does well with the style is but severely lacking in the story and the substance, where there is a complete lack of heart and soul.<br/><br/>Overall, not awful but disappoints hugely both as a standalone and especially as an adaptation of a classic show. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I'm about as big a Dark Shadows fan as the next person who grew up on the series. I feel closer to the Collins Family more to my real relatives, but this movie is like watching a high school drama class trying to act out the dirty secrets of my family at exaggerated and misinformed levels. I was expecting something more from the mind of Tim Burton of ""Sleepy Hollow"" fame, not the Tim Burton of ""Willie Wonka"" infamy. To me, Dark Shadows was about a family living in a haunted house, and one of the relatives was a vampire. The campy aspects of it were barely noticeable, but in this interpretation, they are elaborated and stretched thin for comedy effect. Yikes!!! Johnny Depp plays a distant and ignorant version of Barnabas Collins whose best moments are trying to understand the Twentieth Century, and Eva Green plays a much more malicious and unscrupulous Angelique, a far distant cry from the tragically romantic version by Lara Parker. One saving grace is Michelle Pfeiffer as Liz Stoddard who looks timeless in the Joan Bennett role. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Carolyn in very small doses scattered through the movie, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a new spin on Julia Hoffman as a washed-up alcoholic psychiatrist scared of getting old. The movie is very loosely based on the events of the series, the characters are taken in directions they shouldn't be taken and new developments and scenarios are created. Looking very much like one of the animated dolls of ""The Corpse Bride,"" Bella Heathcote wanders through this insane asylum of caricatures and eerily feeling right at home. The final climax between Barnabas and Angelique looks and feels taken from ""Death Becomes Her"" with some very late plot points and revelations tossed in. I was bitterly disappointed with this film, which at times seems more like one long dirty joke. If it was not for the original Sixties series to compare it to, this adaptation might have stood alone as a parody of horror movies, but instead, I consider it an insult to a series that both inspired my imagination and still haunts my dreams. However, for a truly worthy legacy of the series, it might be best to check out the 1990s mini-series with Ben Cross and Joanna Going that was so unjustly canceled."

Was surprised that they did keep it very serious for the most part. All the funny bits are in the adds and trailers. But the Nosferatu Barnabas look prevented any of this cinematic waste to work at all.

So ironically original fans may get more enjoyment out of this, bit not in any way that the makers of this intended.

That may be something for all to follow as a good example of how to handle this. Don't speak about it, and I for one won't waste any more time thinking about it."

","Ed Wood was the last time Burton really kept me in aww~mode... I have been a long time fan of his work & his overall feel, but this time out, everything falls flat and not even the blue cheekbones of Sir Depp can bring this back to life. Shame.<br/><br/>It should be noted as well that while shot with a big budget, the Collinswood set feels about as big as a shoebox. I guess all the money went into that house, but I could not help notice how small the world the movie took place in. Its basically narrow streets and two canneries at the end of a pier~<br/><br/>The biggest fault I had with the movie (which I was consistently trying to enjoy as it went on) besides the script was the casting. Everyone was bland, lifeless and dull. Depp was the obvious standout, getting the laughs and embodying Barnabas,but everyone else left me with a kind of smattering of appeal towards their characters. When they weren't absent for 45 minutes between scenes (Im looking at you Governess), the supporting cast kind just turned up their ""gufaww"" rate and walked right through everything.<br/><br/>But the music is great!"

","I never thought I'd write that, and it pains me to write this about a Tim Burton movie, but it was just bloody awful. The intro fast-forwards over events in the 18th century that transform the rich and successful fish business owner Barnabus Collins into a vampire, and shows us how he was sealed in a coffin and buried by an angry mob. When he wakes up about 200 years later, we are introduced to the 1970's Collins family: A charming bunch of quirky people, from the weird daughter to the alcoholic psychiatrist.<br/><br/>It was set up for comedy to come, but there the fun sadly ended, and was replaced by endless, brain-numbing dialogs and colorful montages, followed by a deus ex machina ending.<br/><br/>Most jokes are forced and the pacing erratic, but the biggest flaw of this movie is that it's absolutely impossible to find any kind of cohesive plot in it. Is it about restoring the family business? No, wait, maybe it's about the struggle between Barnabus and the witch that turned him into a vampire. Might be about Barnabus trying to become human again with the help of some unexplained procedure done by the alcoholic. No, apparently it's about the love story between two people we don't even hear talking to each other until 1,25 hours into the movie, but who 20 minutes later can't live without each other.<br/><br/>Honestly, it's so nondescript that I can't even write a coherent review about it. It's not funny (apart from some scenes you see in the trailer), it's not dramatic, not scary, not romantic, and the characters sure aren't going to captivate anyone. I don't know what it's supposed to be, but the end result is a boring mess; more of a patch-work of desultory scenes than a movie."
"napierslogs","4","30","62","10 May 2012"," A beautiful but boring production of vampires and witches and love and other nonsense
","I'm assuming it's the recent obsession with vampires, including teenage vampire love and nonsensical vampire lore, that has made it okay to make movies based on bad 1960s horror-drama soap operas. I had also assumed that Tim Burton's remake of ""Dark Shadows"" would be a comedy. In that case, at least, I was wrong. Unfortunately, the film stayed faithful to the original and was more soap opera-like than comedic.<br/><br/>Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is from the 1770s but had a curse placed on him (because of unrequited love) and is pulled from his coffin as a vampire in 1972. There are a few quick jokes making fun of the 1970s and the changing of the times, and then sprinkled throughout there are a handful of funny one-liners as Barnabas comes to terms with the new-age world. I would have actually preferred the movie if that was the entire thing. But instead it was mostly about rich families trying to maintain their wealth and control their fortune and status in a small community. It's also about vampires and witches falling in love and determining their destiny.<br/><br/>These characters really don't do anything interesting so I certainly don't care about their future, whether it's a lack of a future or an eternal future. Again, as a comedy, it could have at least been entertaining. Being a Tim Burton film though, he obviously cares more about the visuals than the characters or the story. It was a fairly detailed atmosphere, combining mystery-like illustrated art work with 1970s lavish musical sets.<br/><br/>The costuming was pretty exquisite. Over-the-top in some cases, but I'm assuming that was the point. The best part was the stylistic flair to Eva Green's witch named Angelique. The clothes and make-up alone defined that character. And that was counteracted with this ethereal beauty of Bella Heathcote and her innocent and unadorned love. I have singled those two actresses out because they were the only two that tried to make this movie interesting on some level.<br/><br/>Since costumes don't comprise an entire movie, the rest was the soundtrack. Littered with catchy pop tunes, we were supposed to be singing along to songs that defined a generation. Obviously that last bit is an exaggeration, but the influence on the movie is not. There was even an entire Alice Cooper concert thrown in just for the fun of it. ""Dark Shadows"" was made just for the fun of it all, but why wasn't it more funny?"

All I knew was that Johnny Depp is a good actor and I took a chance hoping that it wasn't scary because, as you know, I need to sleep at night.<br/><br/>What it wasn't: Not scary, not funny, and not entertaining. And after all that I had to ask myself: why was this made in the first place? Nothing made sense. A story should have a beginning, a middle and an ending. This had a middle and stayed there as we had nothing to look forward to because the middle never moved anywhere. And, there was no caring for any of the characters because we didn't really get a chance to get to know them. See?<br/><br/>I stayed with it for one reason. I did like Johnny Depp's performance with that cadence. If the script was any better this might have had a chance at being entertaining. Didn't happen.<br/><br/>One bright spot was a Karen Carpenter song that they let play almost all the way through. Very good, but that was the only bright spot. Alice Cooper was brought in and, of course, looked every bit Goth as I guess that was a theme someone forgot to capitalize on. <br/><br/>I was looking for something as good as The ADDAMS FAMILY, and maybe even THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.

","'The curse to live forever' in '12 anticipated the incoming hyper age, and how our computer immortality would make us comfortably numb, trapped, and complacent inside our mental coffins. See this family rotting away completely detached from the outside world, the living ones carrying the burden of ancestral expectation, same as humanity itself, in a way carrying the very same fate as Collins.<br/><br/>McDonalds as 'Mephistopheles' meaning streamlining as the anti-Christ. A very 70s attitude that could only be brought out via an outsider ancient being. The film is 2012 viewed by 1970s viewed by 1500s.<br/><br/>'12 was the vampire time in culture, a final peak in destructive yuppie romanticism, as the Mayan prophecy brought our new age of 'life online'.<br/><br/>As streamlining took wing in the 70s it contrasts revolution-individual, the real reason the film chose this period: the sexual revolution. The personal inside streamlining of industry is an interesting study. Plus gothic because 'humanity's ghost.'<br/><br/>Look at Angelique's (Eva Green) BDSM sub-dom romance with Collins, where she derives sexual fulfillment over centuries knowing he is below in chains, driving her to dominate business by owning her sexuality.<br/><br/>Even for him being owned feels right as repentence for his crimes in love; this all somehow keeps him sane below ground so when he returns he goes on this orgy of murder.<br/><br/>Compare to the arid sexuality and frustration with matriarch Elizabeth (Pfeiffer) and Roger (Miller). Tutor Miss Winters is chaste and vacant as we learn fulfilled in some lesbian union binding with the ghost. Carolyn (Moretz)'s werewolf secret parallels getting stoned to Pink Floyd or conjuring entities through LSD; making her parents boomer hypocrisy and teen angst bearable.<br/><br/>""A woman doctor? How strange."" Then she brings him to life with blood transfusions and tests his virility making him see the use in that.<br/><br/>The film's sexuality brings a sort of nasty context but it's not shy about it.<br/><br/>The 21st century would look like this, as within great events of change periods of 'nothing' follow awaiting a life to be lived. This is a bored humanity. So much written on the 70s, the happenings were a cure for 'nothing happening.' The drugs conceding inside was the last journey. The same freedom enabling sexual revolution knew our incoming uselessness being streamlined. So march with pleasure to your doom.<br/><br/>The film is saying everything changes but you're not missing anything. Then the vampire introduces freshness or actual living by being of the past: we form our own reality identity not through consumption but through our own heightened theater. Meaning, the answer is in tradition-dignity not debasement.<br/><br/>The best scene by far was Collins by the ocean side walking with Miss Victoria and there it approximated an actual beautiful film. The patriarch brought in to add a dose of healthy masculinity and conservatism balancing this bored and lost clan. The tutor overwhelmed by the changing of the guard, a generation so divided every single generation after was a chess-move reaction against it. The pair join by nature, hopeless yet found peace and ease against the chaotic clashing waves. If only Tim Burton subdued the blockbuster mechanics and gave us more of this sort of gentle romantic theater."

","I have sort of lost interest in Tim Burton's movie's as of late, as it's seems to follow the same patterns. It's a creepy adaptation that starts the same two actors. The problem with Tim Burton's adaptations is that he tries to force so much of his schtick onto something that's already proved capable of functioning without it. I love his earlier stuff, but this was the death nail to the coffin needed for Tim Burton to change his act such it's getting old. I think it's time to reassess how the director should make movies. First off, the Original 1966's Dark Shadows TV Show Series didn't have the biggest fan base in the world. It have its share of fans, but in no way does it have the same numbers of fans as other supernatural shows at the time, such as Dr. Who or Twilight Zone. Second off, this movie is so unlike the Original Dark Shadows, that fans of the original will probably not like it. The Dark Shadows TV show was a Soap Opera that had very few supernatural elements. For the most parts, the show dealt with normal soap plots. The show is pretty awful in my opinion. The only good thing from that show was actor Johnathan Frid as Barnabas Collins. He pretty much help save the show. His character wasn't supposed to be the hero, as he was pretty much the villainous character just like Angelique who cheats, lies, kidnaps, and torment people. It's not until later episode, does he become more human. In this modern version, Barnabas Collin is the brooding protagonist play by Johnny Depp who must protect his dysfunctional descendants from the evil curses of the witch known as Angelique (Eva Green) who killed his lover and turn him into a vampire. In no way, does Johnny Depp act like the callous, canny, somewhat unlikable man Jonathan Frid's version, but more like a goofball, charming, and pretty likable character who can't lie worth a dime. In the Jonathan Frid's version, he would probably kill Angelique if he ever finds a way. In this version, Johnny Depp spent most of the movie trying to get his family name back into business, wasting screen time with multiply sub-plots that go nowhere like turning himself back into human, or starting a canning company. There is no character development in him. It wasn't until toward the end, he get back to the main plot, with him finally fighting Angelique. There are scenes with other characters that isn't explain, misused or not well flesh out like David (Gulliver McGrath) seeing ghosts and never treated by the doctor or take care of the babysitter that supposes to be watching him. Another is how Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) a psychiatrist is able also to be a Hematologist as well. Yet again, Roger (Johnny Lee Miller) exile from the family has nothing to do with the plot. Last, Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz) twist was totally out-of-nowhere. How did nobody notice that when she was a baby. I would think baby would be care 24/7 so somebody would have notice. The movie does an horrible job of exposition, by having everything too rushed in the end. I didn't feel that much strong in building the love relationship between Victoria (Bella Heathcote) and the main character when Victoria was missing out in most of the film and the love interest seem forced in the end. The problem with Burton's film is it couldn't stick with a tone of the film. You either go full-on camp, or you go full-on comedy. The movie is supposed to be funny, then they threw seriously WTF dramatic moment into it, such in the case, like a girl getting electroshock therapy that more shocking than funny and women dying. It takes them out of the film. Dark Shadows also has too good of acting. If it had been like a parody, playing up the shot-live aspect or the terrible acting, then it could have worked. Remember this was written by Seth Grahame-Smith who wrote the screenplay for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and we all know how that film went. It felt like a fanboy film that try to stuff years and years of show materials into a 2 hour film. I do like some things. I loved the set designs. Interior of that manor was beautiful. The music choice was great. Danny Elfman is once again, great. The acting is great, even if wasted. I should mention Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother as she had the glue to the film. The production and make up is brilliant. Overall: this movie is worst than the 1970's House of Dark Shadows and the 1991's Dark Shadows TV Show. I would say, watch those first, before trying to watch this mess of a film. In the end, this movie is like the Twilight films. It's a big pile of vampire bat guano"
"didonatope","4","23","47","11 May 2012"," Tangled in Subplots (SPOILERS)
","I have never been disappointed by a Burton-Depp collaboration before, but because of an inexperienced writer and an uneven script, I found this film to be a definite let-down.<br/><br/>This movie stars Johnny Depp (this is his 8th collaboration with Tim Burton)as Barnabas Collins, a man who was turned into a vampire and locked in a coffin for 196 years by an evil witch named Angelique(Eva Green). Depp and Green are fantastic in their roles, and they definitely do their best with what is given. Unfortunately, their romantic plot line doesn't make much sense; Barnabas knows she killed his fiancée and locked him in a box but he seems far too casual about it. He even has sex with her later on. It is never explained why he is still willing to romantically engage with her, so this plot line seemed a bit convoluted.<br/><br/>In addition to this, there are several subplots that feel rushed. One instance involves Helena Bonham Carter's character having her own love affair with Barnabas. This barely contributes to the main plot but by the end of the film, the screenplay tries to make you think it was important.<br/><br/>Moreover, the character Victoria has a subplot revolving around being able to talk to ghosts. She claims she was driven to the Collins' mansion but her connection to the family is never really explained. Her lack of development is unfortunate because she is the main love interest in the film.<br/><br/>Other subplots involve the son's deadbeat dad issues, his father's unfaithfulness to his wife, and Chloe Mortez's character's werewolf powers (the latter isn't shown until the tail end of the film). Tim Burton can usually handle tonal shifts in comedy and drama, but this film mangles both elements in a knot with several subplots and underdeveloped characters.<br/><br/>I don't however think that Tim Burton is entirely to blame. This film still looks amazing; the sets, the costumes, the effects, and the cinematography are flawless. From the elegance of Barnabas' outfit and cane to the seductive high-contrast nature of Eva Green's clothing, the actors brilliantly shine in a less-than-impressive film.<br/><br/>The visuals are high class as well; the Collins' mansion is brilliantly done with marble fireplaces, wooden statues, and interesting secret passages. In the hands of a more experience writer, the mansion could have easily been elaborated on more. That would have been very impressive.<br/><br/>As it stands though, I was simply disappointing with this film. I place most of the blame on writer Seth-Grahame-Smith, who has very little experience in writing films. Hopefully his next scripted films: ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" and ""Beetlejuice 2″ are superior to this let-down."

This was a fantastic piece that I look forward to seeing again and again. It is not a straight up comedy, but I do not know of a better way they could have sold it. It's nice to see vampires that do not sparkle, and cannot be touched by sunlight. Burton and Depp have made a fantastic movie that has monsters that look like they are supposed to.

Instead, the tone changes drastically from Sleepy Hollow to a poor man's Beetlejuice. It's as if the opening sequence was directed by a skilled craftsman and the remainder by a skilled but inexperienced dilletante. The sets are excellent, as is the cinematography but the characters are underdeveloped and the actors underused. Depp puts in a carefully crafted performance as Count Chocula, but not Barnabas Collins. This is a disaster and the threat of a sequel is unbearable. Certainly, the original series was a bit campy but charmingly so. This film is just over the top in a very underwhelming way. Guess though that as long as it sells seats that's all that matters in Hollywood. As it goes this film is all dressed up with no where to go."

And more CRAP!!! <br/><br/>OMG, what a horrendous motion picture!!!! This film had the makings to be something incredible, but instead of playing this film to be scary or serious; Tim Burton tried to do it as ""camp"". However, the jokes fail miserably, the story line sad, and the dialog pathetic.<br/><br/>Based on the 60's vampire soap opera, Dark Shadows re-teams Johnny Depp and Tim Burton; however, this latest collaboration is a poor excuse for entertainment. Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, the Collinswood patriarch. Doomed to live his life as an immortal vampire by his spurned lover and witch, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green).<br/><br/>Barnabas is accidentally released from his tomb in 1972, when excavation in Collins Port unearths his coffin. He returns to his beloved home of Collinwood after nearly 200-year absence to find it in shambles, and the Collins family name and fortune in disarray. Barnabas vows to right this wrong, and reinstate the Collins family name back to its glory of yore.<br/><br/>The saddest part of this film is that it had all the elements to be a good film. The unearthing sequence of Barnabas was probably the best of the film Barnabas was fiendish, evil, and wicked; the sequence was terrifyingly delicious. This is how the whole film should have been. I am not sure what Tim Burton's vision for this film was supposed to be, but what he ended up with was CRAP!!!!!! CRAP!!!! CRAP!!! <br/><br/>Avoid this film at all cost!!!

","I had only a passing acquaintance with the original series but had high expectations of the film as i am generally a fan of Tim Burton. I loved the setting's Gothic darkness peppered with the kitsch of the 1970's, but beyond that the film was a disappointment. Not funny enough to be a parody and not serious enough to be an homage, this movie wasted the talents of its cast.<br/><br/>Burton didn't seem to know who his audience was, and as such, story elements and characters were introduced helter skelter without any sense of how they fit into the film or would play out in the end. For example, David Collins, a boy who is supposed to be so highly disturbed by his relationship with his dead mother's ghost that a full time psychologist and a string of nannies have been employed by the family to keep him under control, is completely manageable and relatively polite. The audience never sees him acting oddly upon her instructions or even conversing with the dead relative, much less showing any signs of being disturbed. Meanwhile, his cousin appears to have some anger issues, and the audience has no idea why until the last ten minutes of the movie when it's revealed out of nowhere that she had been turned into a werewolf as an infant. Despite the bizarre timing of this revelation, it has no bearing on the outcome of the story at all. Instead, ""disturbed"" David's ghostly mother, a character whom we know nothing about and have never seen until the climax of the film, ultimately brings about the downfall of the antagonist. <br/><br/>I had the impression that much of the story was left on the cutting room floor, which may be the result of trying to fit a five-year-long soap opera into a two-hour movie. The result was a morass of flat, unsympathetic characters and loose strings that left me with little desire to learn where they led. <br/><br/>The film had moments of humor mostly tied to the incongruity of the two time periods, the most noteworthy of which was the use of the clever use of 70's music tracks, but this was not nearly enough to make up for the film's flaws. Overall, it felt like I was being told a joke by someone who doesn't know how to tell a joke."

","After seeing the trailers for this film I was prepared to hate it. The trailer promises something it (fortunately) doesn't deliver: Endless fish-out-of-water jokes about a vampire being released from a locked coffin after two centuries. Since that wears thin after two minutes it's well that this film didn't spend all its time there. Nor was this film a true comedy or even a satire. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to define it with any exactitude.<br/><br/>After a good, atmospheric prologue to explain Barnabas' backstory, the film becomes somewhat uneven. The comedy was slapdash in places, juvenile in others, and mostly pulling teeth in the rest. The best laughs in this film are actually from lines such as Barnabas' response to Carolyn's ""Are you stoned?"" when he says ""They tried stoning me, my dear; it did not work."" While this is a fish-out-of-water joke because of the gap in vernacular, it points to the realization that any humor that should be transfused into DARK SHADOWS should have been on the order of Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. Visual jokes such as Barnabas brushing his fangs to no reflection in the mirror and his reactions to objects unknown in his own time should have seemed too obvious to be included in anything that purports to be original. <br/><br/>While Tim Burton's visual sense for sets and costumes is admirable and well done in this film, the makeup and lighting leave much to be desired. He is a one-trick pony with overpale complexions and whiteface makeup and dark sunken eyes on the characters and hair colors that look like nothing from nature or like they don't belong on the actress that wears it. His fascination with jailbait females is somewhat disturbing and accounts for a Carolyn who is significantly younger than in the TV series and a Victoria Winters who doesn't look remotely old enough to be a governess. In contrast, the makeup on Eva Green is designed to make her look cheap and hard, which is in absolute contrast to Lara Parker, the original Angelique. The special effects that make her farther away from human also do nothing positive for either the character or the story.<br/><br/>There were several lines lifted or adapted from the original series (fans will recognize them) and this is where we see Depp's appreciation of it. The power of the original series lay in the humanity of Barnabas and Angelique, not fully realized in this film. While it is impossible for a two-hour film to do what a stripped television program can do, we don't get enough of Barnabas' guilt nor do we get any sense that Angelique felt anything real for him. Which is a pity because Johnny Depp showed that he could have been an excellent Barnabas with a better script and without the Max Shreck fingernails and white foundation. <br/><br/>There was very little used of Robert Cobert's music from the original series and little new Danny Elfman music in favor of using actual 1970s music that was meant mostly to serve as ironic commentary to the action (such as the Barry White song used for the demonic sex scene whose action reminded me of the aerial fight in THE LOST BOYS). As in the TV series, the 1970s music should have been restricted to the party scene and scenes in the Blue Whale or other venues where such music would have been heard. Not doing so served to take away from what should have been the atmosphere of the film."

","This was by far the most boring Tim Burton film EVER created. It tells the story of a love struck witch that curses a family and of course since she can't just curse the family with a vampire she does all she can to destroy the family business.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I'm being generous with the 1 out of 10 rating. Anyone that gave this movie a 10 needs to get their head examined. It was seriously THE most boring film I've watched till the end. I'd say wait till this flop shows up in the redbox or netflix queues. Don't waste your money on this one! My girlfriend AND I both commented at the end that we almost fell asleep it was so boring. You've been warned!"

I kind of wished it was longer because the ending could have been potentially better. I thought is was worth the money spent. I am definitely buying it when it finally comes out on DVD and Blu-ray! Its a perfect date night movie. I considered it more of a comedy than a horror movie... Especially since there isn't anything scary about the movie. The joke setup and timing was perfect! I hope this helps y'all make a decision on if this movie is worth the money. My personally opinion is that the movie is, but its up to you! Enjoy!"
"lagudafuad","5","7","12","23 May 2012"," What a waste of time
","The decision to watch Dark Shadows was not based on the fact that it starred Johnny Depp, although this is a reason for some to go to the cinemas. Now the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer (Who played Catwoman and to me is the best portrayal till date) was as incentive but the main reason I actually opted to see this was because it was done by Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is known for his Gothic movies and this is no exception, one of my favourite Tim Burton movie is still The Nightmare Before Christmas. Other greats by Tim Burton are Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992) and my all time favourite Beetlejuice (I have a lot of Tim Burton favourites).<br/><br/>Well enough of Tim let's get talking about Dark Shadows, the movie is based on a soap opera of the same name that premiered on ABC between 1966 and 1971. Funny although Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is the main character in this movie in the soap he was introduced in the second season and grew to become one of the main character.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of the episodes in the series but if the movie is anything like the series then I wonder...<br/><br/>This is the Eight (if am not mistaken) movie that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have made together and it is one of the worst I have seen from both.<br/><br/>The main issue about the movie isn't the theme, the theme is actually well crafted and I give kudos to the customer designer and the set manager, but the movie is so unevenly paced one time you are excited then next you are dragged into a long conversation.<br/><br/>The Vampire has some tricks up its sleeves other than the fact that he could make you his zombie (which he did enough times in the movie), he could also bore you to death (which he did throughout the movie).<br/><br/>The story goes thus: In the 18th century the Collins built a huge fortune in the fishing industry in Maine. A witch (Eva Green) falls in love with Barnabas (Johnny Depp) the son of Mr. Collins, but he turned her down after some..<br/><br/>She out of anger and jealousy kills everything Barnabas loves, including his parents his wife and she did the one thing that witches have not been able to do for a while now, she transforms him into a vampire and had him buried alive. (Witches turning men into vampires, where have I heard that before? Oh! yeah no where) We are now in the 70s and Barnabas is dug out. He reunites with his weird descendants and begins plotting his return to power. Also in these 196 years in the ground the witch still was alive.<br/><br/>Will I still watch another Tim Burton movie? Hell yeah! Alice in Wonderland (which he did with Johnny Depp) is still the eleventh highest grossing, movie in the world, so Tim has got it in him to make a masterpiece just that this movie is 3 stars from being one.<br/><br/>If we point our focus on Depp and rest of the crew, it was a share waste of talent. Having Pfeiffer and Eva Green and making no good use of them is amazing. Depp's movie before this was The Rum Diary a movie I still don't get.<br/><br/>All in all I won't waste a dime on this movie this I tell you."
"hell-cat-1","3","7","12","22 May 2012"," Depp really needs to stop doing his friend's movies!
","Seriously, what was the point in making this? And furthermore, what was Johnny Depp thinking? This coupled with his cameo in Jack and Jill makes me think he's losing his mind. It's just a waste of his talent. Even the special effects in this movie were fake and hokey, the storyline was awful, and the very few laughs did not make up for the rest of the movie, which was just a total snooze-fest that I wished would just end. The only highlight was Alice Cooper's performance at the end and Johnny Depp referring to him as a female. <br/><br/>Tim Burton really needs to stop making dark Gothic movies starring Depp just for the sake of making them. It's not working anymore. This was extremely unimaginative and uninteresting and would only appeal to teenage Twilight fans, in particular the nonsensical werewolf scenario at the end which was extremely pointless. I rarely write movie reviews but just had to with this as I don't understand the intention of the film at all. Save yourself the money, it is as bad and boring as everyone is saying (unless you are 13 maybe) and go see The Dictator or even Piranha 3DD instead, which was far more entertaining!"

","I am a Johnny Depp and Tim Burton fan girl!!!!! That being said...<br/><br/>The intro excited me, but the rest of the movie made me regret buying the tickets. The movie is a downward spiral of awkward acting and bad jokes.<br/><br/>Burton's visuals are wonderful as always. His colors and scenes make you believe you are where he wants you to be, but the dialogue is simply horrendous for most of the movie. You get rewarded by a few funny jokes for not walking out of the theater once Collins reaches the house, but otherwise are left feeling underwhelmed.<br/><br/>I wont spoil it with details (not that there is much to spoil), but I will say this: Leave your lofty expectations at the theater door so you don't get pushed off cloud nine only to land on 100 degree cement... barefoot."

","My Wife and I were both HUGE fans of the original TV series. We actually own most of the original paperback copies of DS as well as the VHS(s) of the original show.<br/><br/>Depp was a perfect Barnabas, and I thought Phieffer was a pretty good Elizabeth. To my wife and I, Eva Green stole the movie as Angelique. Her overall vibe in the movie was great. But the reason why I only gave it a 5/10 is twofold;<br/><br/>1) - What little comedy there was was shown in the TV previews, and, 2) - I thought the overall pace of the movie was extremely boring. <br/><br/>While DS always had a dark, deadpan vibe to it, I thought Burton went so far in trying to capture that vibe that he ruined any chance at capturing the overall suspense of the old show. The casting was great, but the editing and pace was terrible. Burton missed on quite a few genuine opportunities to add a bit more humor and there was absolutely no real suspense to speak of. It was pretty obvious what would happen next; including the ending. <br/><br/>Unlike other reviewers, though, I will surely be on line to watch the (hopefully) next installment.

","When a movie is staffed with some of the best actors of the day, that usually indicates that they liked the script.right? Well, not exactly. Dark Shadows is a great introduction to the dark shadows of Hollywood. Sometimes it doesn't matter what script you think is good and what script you think is bad. Instead, it's about who you owe a favor or what studio you work for. How else could such a plain script attract the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Carter, and Chloe Moretz?<br/><br/>I have never seen the original television show that sparked this movie. However, to my understanding, it was a dark drama. How did such a television show get turned into a comedy? What's worse is that is got turned into a comedy that didn't make me laugh in the slightest. The movie is filled with awkward lines and out of character moments. The writer—Seth Smith—shows just how much of a amateur he is in the world of film scripts.<br/><br/>The only enjoyable part of the movie was when the actors found a way to work outside of the script. Although Chloe Moretz character was horribly constructed, she still made some of her scenes work. Johnny Depp was able to pull of the strangeness that comes with losing two centuries. Above all others, Helena Carter actually pulled off a believable character. Just a fair warning to all screenwriters out there. If you only successful character is the drunk, you have a big problem.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is the master of ""hit or miss."" He had directed some incredible movies in Edward Scissorhands and Big Fish. However, he has plenty of terrible movies: Alice in Wonderland, Mars Attacks, Beetlejuice, etc. There is little room for in-between with Tim Burton. I don't consider this a bad thing. He goes all-in when he makes a movie. When it succeeds, you get fantastic results. The only problem is he creates a lot of bad movies in the process. Please, Tim Burton, stop taking mediocre scripts!<br/><br/>The only people who will see this movie are fans of vampire movies and fans of Johnny Depp. The thing is, this movie disgraces both. Johnny Depp had put out come fantastic movies. With such a great acting ability, there is no need for him to be in such a mediocre film. As for the ever-expanding genre of vampiresthere are plenty of good alternatives. Go watch Daybreakers while you wait for the release of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.<br/><br/>reillyreviews.wordpress.com"
"mukava991","5","12","24","14 May 2012"," starts okay, devolves into screeching camp
","Tim Burton's reimagining of ""Dark Shadows"" is a mishmash. The original ""Dark Shadows"" TV series unfolded - sometimes leisurely, sometimes recklessly - from plot to plot, highlighting along the way a variety of characters including a warlock, a ""phoenix,"" various ghosts, werewolves, psychics and spiritual mediums, witches, Frankensteins and mad doctors, professors of the occult, religious fanatics, and endless vampire victims. Time travel warped the chronological flow for months at a time. It was the pull of the overlapping narratives, improbable as they were, combined with the persuasiveness of the characters and the ever-present unifying element of creepy musical underscoring by Robert Cobert that kept audiences watching despite the tacky special effects, botched line readings and wobbly set pieces which, ridiculous as they were, transmitted an otherworldliness which was alien to anything else on the small screen at that time and which even today retains a singular character.<br/><br/>First, let it be said that Burton and his writing team, faced with winnowing out two hours of content from an ocean of possibilities, had to make hard choices. Unfortunately they chose silly camp as their overriding style. <br/><br/>The introductory scenes, set in the mid-1700's and narrated by Johnny Depp, straightforwardly and melodramatically explain how Barnabas Collins, the young heir to coastal Maine seafood canning fortune, is turned into a vampire by the spiteful witch Angelique as punishment for favoring another female. Being supernatural creatures, Barnabas and Angelique never die, so we meet them again 200 years later.<br/><br/>But when we are whisked to the year 1972 as a construction crew inadvertently digs up Barnabas's chain-wrapped coffin, the movie suddenly descends into broad CGI-assisted slapstick and ironic camp, with the most consistent theme being Barnabas as odd man out from another era mistaking electronic or mechanical devices such as automobiles, TVs or neon signs as satanic apparitions. <br/><br/>When we are introduced to the 20th century occupants of Collinwood, the family estate, the movie turns to the style of sometimes clever, sometimes over-obvious drawing room banter. Once the characters have been established the story galumphs along through a combination of montages (some with visual wit) accompanied by 70s pop music and outbursts of violence (fights, explosions, a wild seduction) until the dreary mess finally ends.<br/><br/>The trajectory of the plot - the struggle of Barnabas to save his family from Angelique's curse and reunite with the modern incarnation of his 18th century lover - brings us too often into the outside world of the nearby town with its noises, bright lights and bustle and corporate board meetings and high-lit factory assembly lines, which violates the stark and morbid Gothic atmosphere that made the original series unique. Simple face-to-face dialogues with perhaps a bit of fisticuffs or strangulation, a dash of poison or a bullet or two, are replaced by endless orgies of environment-shattering mayhem, drowning out the melancholia that was one of the hallmarks of the series. We are benumbed. Perhaps the lowest point is reached at a ball thrown by the Collins family to ingratiate themselves with the community which they have alienated over the decades. A remarkably well-preserved Alice Cooper plays himself as the ""entertainment,"" complete with rock ensemble, while four cast members from the original series make a fleeting and utterly pointless cameo appearance as guests among the crowd. They seem insulted, degraded.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp emerges with dignity as the conflicted vampire Barnabas Collins. He makes the character his own while also channeling key aspects of the role's originator Jonathan Frid not only in his almost-British line readings, but also in the way he extends his consonants, particularly his s's, at the ends of words. He maintains a haunted dignity, aided by some beautifully written lines in the 18th century style. The other cast members range from excellent (Chloe Grace Moretz as bratty Collins daughter Caroline) to good (Johnny Lee Miller, as the decadent Roger Collins, who could have been even better if he had been given more of a chance) to sloppy (Helena Bonham Carter, as Dr. Julia Hoffman, who tries to cure Barnabas of vampirism; she too is undermined by the script which makes her sober, thoughtful character into a pill-popping, carrot-haired lush for no apparent reason).<br/><br/>It would be interesting if other directors took a crack at ""Dark Shadows."" There is much in this iconic artifact of popular culture to draw from and it's a shame to let it go to waste. How about it, Mr. Lynch?"

"timdalton007","3","6","10","24 October 2016"," A Bloody Mess
","Translating television shows to the big screen is part and parcel of popular film-making dating back to the 1950s. So it was no surprise that Dark Shadows, the legendary Gothic horror soap opera that ran from 1966-1971, came back to the big screen in 2012. Unlike the earlier low-budget films made after the show's demise, this one was to be a big budget star vehicle from director Tim Burton with a cast that included Johnny Depp. On the surface, it looked to be a wonder mix of a director and star getting the chance to bring a mutual favorite of theirs to life once more. What it became instead was something of a mess.<br/><br/>To be fair, translating any long running program to the big screen would be a challenge. Never mind if that series ran for something like 1200 episodes like Dark Shadows did while covering everything from vampires to witches, werewolves, and ghosts not to mention usual soap opera tropes like family secrets and twisted relationships. Yet for its opening twenty-odd minutes, Burton and his writers (John August and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter writer Seth Grahame-Smith) seem to do it as they quickly introduce the series most famous character, the vampire Barnabas Collins (played by Depp) and set the stage for the film's main setting: the Maine town of Collinsport in 1972. For these opening minutes, it's a wonderful Gothic film full of atmosphere and menace as Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) is introduced to the Collins family and their home. It doesn't last very long though.<br/><br/>Sadly, once Depp's Barnabas reappears, the film can't figure out what it's meant to be. Is it an adaptation of the TV series? Is it a Gothic horror film? Is it a parody of the series? Instead of picking any one of those (which, under Burton's direction, would undoubtedly have been interesting), the script tries to be all three. For nearly ninety minutes of its running time, the film moves along from one genre to the other. Worse, it often does so within the same scene which leaves scenes feeling even weirder than one might normally expect within a Tim Burton film. One never knows where to laugh, cringe, or be scared and the result is a film that is immensely unsatisfying to say the least.<br/><br/>It also plays merry havoc with every single performance in the film. Depp's Barnabas has some good moments but the ever shifting nature of the film, especially the attempts to make it comedic, never give him anything really solid enough to play with. The havoc really takes its toll on the usually reliable Eva Green as the villainous witch Angelique who instead gives a performance that, outside of her appearance in the film's opening minutes, becomes overplayed to the point of lacking either menace or humor. The rest of the cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley, and Jonny Lee Miller are all effectively wasted as nobody gets anything solid to do in the film with Carter and Miller in particular playing parody versions of their TV counterparts. Of the entire cast, Bella Heathcote as Victoria Winters fares better but largely because her character becomes the audience's in-road to the Collins' family and by her becoming Depp's love interest, something that allows her to shine ahead of almost everyone else. It's a potentially good cast let down by a poor script.<br/><br/>Yet the film does have some positive attributes. The aforementioned opening minutes are superb with the combination of script, Burton's direction, and production values creating a wonderful atmosphere that the film then throws away. Even in the lackluster parts of the film, the production values are first rate though. The 1972 setting of the film is interesting with 1970s fashions conflicting nicely with the Gothic mansion. Indeed, Collinwood itself is a wonderful piece of pastiche Gothic design though Burton has always had that on his side. There's a number of nice cameos as well including some members of the original Dark Shadows cast that eagle eyed viewers might spot. If one was to rate the film on style instead of substance, it would be pretty good.<br/><br/>Yet for all of its aesthetic attributes, Tim Burton's film of Dark Shadows is a mess. The biggest fault lies in with a script that can't ever quite make up its mind what kind of story it's trying to tell which in turn leaves virtually the entire cast out to dry. The opening minutes hint at a film that could have been good but instead it feels like a trailer for a film that should have been made but wasn't. Bigger isn't always better and this film is a perfect example of how not to bring a TV series to the big screen."

Honestly the most ridiculous is attitude of a vampire to a woman-she put him in a coffin and he being so powerful didn't even try to break these chains,only little boy helped set him free! That's not everything about them-he beat her up,even a vampire must be polite and have self respect of something in this style-what is an example for the kids who will watch it???

Mr. Burton never decides if he is making a comedy or a horror or a drama or a satire and ends up with a jumbled mess. What an utter disappointment. Eva Green tries her best with the script she is given and Jackie Earle Haley as Willie Loomis gives a competent performance. Johnny Depp seems bored with his role and obviously does not have his heart in it. Gulliver McGrath does bring the innocence of David Collins into the film and was the only character that brought to mind the feeling of the 60's hit show. I knew with it being a Burton film that I was not going to walk into a remake of the Dark Shadows of the 1960's, but I did not expect to walk into a piece of junk."
"danman983","4","9","17","24 May 2012"," Very disappointing
","The film ""Dark Shadows"" is a date with destiny that its director Tim Burton does not show up for. This could have been a very good scary movie - easily one of the best of its era. Unfortunately Burton ruins this by constantly throwing in dumb jokes that are never funny. It seems like such a waste. The budget was obviously huge, the kind most fright-film makers could only dream of. A talented cast is assembled. The lighting, cinematography, special effects, sets and costumes are good as any chiller I've ever seen, and far beyond most. Even with all the lame jokes the basic plot line manages to chill - probably the main reason none of the dumb humor works. Bela Lugosi would have traded most of his career for one movie with a budget as big as what 60 seconds of this cost. Yet it doesn't work. The fault lies with Burton, who, it seems, lacks the courage to make the genuine attempt to scare you that this tale deserved. It's like he was afraid of being ridiculed in case a true attempt at a fright flick failed, so he hedges his bets by ladling on camp before the horse even comes out of the gate. Like he has to let you know he's so far above the material he's winking at it - or so he believes. The story's a lot better than what he does with it. The supporting actors are good, especially Michelle Pfeiffer. But Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas Collins is not one of his best. Like Burton, he ladles on the camp, and it fails. Also the accent he attempts often seems unwieldy, and how white is his skin? Well, that arctic white shade you painted your kitchen wall to match the refrigerator? It's whiter. The scenes of Barnabas having sex do not work on any level. Some things are better left to the imagination. Truly a disappointment."
"tyreeewebster","8","9","17","18 May 2012"," Retrospective Reviews- Dark Shadows (2012)
","Johnny Depp and Tim Burton return in a triumphant revival and show us why the Hell we see their movies! After the immensely frightening, mediocre and humourless film that was 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND' in 2010, Tim Burton goes back to his Gothic roots in this film about a 17th century Vampire that is locked away and awakens in 1972, hoping to reconnect with his almost extinct family.<br/><br/>First of all, to make things clear, I am NOT a fan of the original television series that this film is based upon, I only found out about it once this film was in the early development stages, but I AM a fan of Tim Burton (who is my favourite director) and Johnny Depp (who also happens to be one of my favourite actors), and I love it every time they join to do a movie, because every time they make a film, it is always different from their previous film, for example, 'EDWARD SCISSORHANDS' in 1990 was a suttle, small scale beautiful fairytale, and then we get 'SLEEPY HOLLOW' in 1999 which was a loud, anarchic, horror story, with a large scale, and so on. This film was extremely different to 'ALICE', it was darker, wittier and most of all a better production.<br/><br/>To start off, Johnny Depp as 'THE MAD HATTER', he wasn't bad in the role, but it wasn't his best role either. His character was quirky and fun to look at, but was just a tad too scary for younger viewers, who were the original target audience, then we see him in the more adult film 'DARK SHADOWS' as Barnabas Collins, he is less scary but does a lot more frightening things, his character is played off as an untouchable playboy who doesn't know that he is out of place and doesn't really understand that he makes the characters around him feel strange and uneasy, but the character is so rude, and so oblivious to the fact that he talks down to other people that we actually like him and enjoy his character. Forgot to mention the fact that his character is so funny and Depp's performance in this film is probably one of his best since, maybe Ichabod Crane. This is all because of Burton's direction and the type of film it is. The other actors did a good job in their roles, but were not seen enough for character development due to the many scenes of Barnabas trying to adapt to his new home and his run- ins with the film villain, Angelique played by Eva Green. But even SHE wasn't seen as much as Depp. But, I'd like to focus on Burton. His trademark style shines it's brightest in this film, as he clearly shows why he is more of a visual artist than a storyteller, the strange shapes and dark, quirky but childlike atmosphere is ALL here, but sometimes lacks the real Gothic nature of Burton's previous efforts.<br/><br/>The story isn't the best, but is easy to follow. To wrap up, this film IS a comedy, a very funny one, but is also a dark, strange Gothic horror film, and the comedy is actually quite hidden. So, 'DARK SHADOWS' fans and Burton/Depp fans should be pleased by this film, it is dark, funny and overall classic Tim Burton. So, ignore the poor reviews.<br/><br/>DARK SHADOWS<br/><br/>Directed by: TIM BURTON <br/><br/>Based on the TV series created by: DAN CURTIS <br/><br/>Starring: JOHNNY DEPP, MICHELLE PFEIFFER, HELENA BONHAM CARTER, EVA GREEN, JACKIE EARLE HALEY, JONNY LEE MILLER, CHLOE GRACE MORETZ, BELLA HEATHCOTE and ALICE COOPER"

The film had me wishing that I had bought a bigger popcorn. That way after about the first ten minutes I would have something to do. The scenery was excellent and gave the film a great Gothic feel that it needed. The ruins of the mansion looked spectacular. Unfortunately the wooden acting and the manner in which each sub plot was written and resolved like a weekly TV drama made it difficult to have any real reaction when something happened. The comedy aspects that this film is supposed to have must have been playing in the cinema next door. I didn't find any comedy in this film except for the abysmal performance of Eva Green. Yet again another movie where the ending is so obvious and embarrassing when it is finally revealed you sit cringing in your chair hoping that they really don't make the second movie.

To make a vampire analogy, this is one Depp/Burton movie that should have NEVER seen the light of day. It's terribly paced, not funny and not interesting. Other then that..."

","Well, twenty dollars and two hours of my life I can't get back. You live and learn - but as my husband pointed out, if I hadn't seen this movie, I would have always wondered. I wish Mr. Burton had made up his mind to make this story either serious or campy. With Johnny Depp as the star, I'd have voted for campy, since he does it so well. There were some twists to the plot that, to me, didn't add anything, and frankly, didn't make sense. In the original soap opera, Barnabas Collins looked fairly normal until the fangs came out. Johnny didn't look even vaguely ""normal"", and any really ""normal"" person would have been put off by his appearance - and certainly wouldn't have been tempted to kiss him. Put some more thought into your next one, Mr. Burton!"

","First off, it's just plain bad. No coherent direction, at times it feels like it's trying to be a comedy, others it tries to be serious, since it never chooses it just falls flat. The staging, costumes, etc were gorgeous. Depp was great as Barnabus, but, the story played out flat.<br/><br/>As for the comedy aspect, what you saw in the trailers was 90% of what was funny in the movie.<br/><br/>Classic failure of Hollywood today, wow you with the trailer, get a big name to lead the film, have gorgeous sets and costumes, set in a beautiful location, in the end it's a stinker."

","I thought that this film was going to be very good, with comedy, drama, romance, etc.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the film show us Barnabas Collins as a human, in the 1700s. It is, perhaps, the best scene in the movie. If only it could have lasted like that.<br/><br/>If you are a huge Dark Shadows fan and have seen the show, you would know that Victoria Winters and Maggie Evans are two different characters, and that the Karolyn Leigh Scott - Maggie Evans - plays Josette DuPress. In the show, however, they combine both Victoria/Viki, and Maggie into one character. Perhaps this makes some sense - since Maggie and Josette look more alike than Viki and Josette. Once again, Tim Burton has decided to add a pathetic back-story to the main character, with some hints of the Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>Barnabas arrives on scene in 1972. At first, his jokes about McDonalds, cars, and other matters are funny, but they become rather old. The entire film focuses on Barnabas and his relationship with Angelique Bouchard, the witch who cursed him 200 years ago, leaving only a few seconds of screen time for the other actors - Pfieffer, Grace Moretz, McGarath, Bonham Carter, etc.<br/><br/>Despite their efforts to cram 6 years worth of soap opera into a 2 hour film, nobody seemed to care about the script, which was utter terrible. The dialogue was dry and predictable.<br/><br/>The film was simply a combination of over-acted drama with bits of unnecessary sex.<br/><br/>Don't rent the movie. Save yourself two hours to do something useful."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","5","8","14 October 2012"," ""Dark Shadows"" is Burton being Burton at his least inspired
","When you let a child play with the same toys over and over again, you're going to end up with some stale make-believe. Tim Burton has pulled his Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter dolls out of his play chest again and decided this time they're engaged in a supernatural love story taking place in the 1970s.<br/><br/>Like most of Burton's films, ""Dark Shadows"" hits on moments of gleeful peculiarity that remind us why we've been following his exploits for decades, but by and large it feels over- trodden and uninspired, and that latter adjective is not one to wield lightly against Burton to be sure.<br/><br/>That's not to say Burton has lost a step by any means; he still does what he does better than anyone can, but his past successes have set the bar higher than he dares to even jump with ""Dark Shadows."" <br/><br/>Depp plays Burton dress-up again as Barnabas Collins of the wealthy Collinses who immigrated from Liverpool and established a fishing empire in Maine. After spurning the love of the witch Angelique (Eva Green), he and his family were cursed. She turned him into a vampire, locking him in a coffin buried underground for nearly 200 years. Now, in the 1970s, he's unearthed and learns that Collins family has fallen quite a bit, so he endeavors to restore them to glory.<br/><br/>The voice-over prologue hits us over the head with language that love is the strongest curse, begging us to care about Collins and his lost love (also cursed by Angelique). We're also then asked to take interest in the dysfunctional Collins family led by the distrustful Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her thick-headed brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) in addition to some other misfits: the rebellious daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz), troubled son (Gulliver McGrath) and his psychiatrist (Bonham Carter). Turns out that Barnabas' exploits as a vampire out of time are far more interesting than whether or not they get their act together as a family.<br/><br/>The archaic expression of crude dialogue written for Barnabas and perfectly suited for Depp provides the chief source of entertainment in what's otherwise a campy affair that hopes you will just embrace its outlandish choices and unjustified quirkiness. It will surely remind those who've seen most of Burton's work that he is a man in love with classic B movies, not to mention Gothic appearances and odd turns of events.<br/><br/>Although Depp brings the humor, Eva Green is the standout as Angelique, who 200 years later still desires Barnabas and has destroyed his family in the process with her own fishing empire. Green is nearly unrecognizable in the role, and despite playing the villain in a campy affair, manages to avoid chewing the scenery to pieces, which can't be over-appreciated in a script of this nature.<br/><br/>Seth Grahame-Smith and John August take liberties with the ""Dark Shadows"" TV show — so I'm told. The film uses the show's concept as inspiration, but inspiration for what? It would seem that the point of adapting something with a fan base would be to honor it with some degree of loyalty. If you're just using the name, characters and basic concept, why not create something entirely original? Perhaps the film's one true crime is providing no good reason for being a ""Dark Shadows"" adaptation, and consequently seeming somewhat purposeless.<br/><br/>No doubt Burton had fun making this movie. It's an excellent excuse to defy the rules of reality and borrow numerous characteristics from the films he has drawn his inspiration from over the years. It's expertly set-decorated and Colleen Atwood's costumes assure there's plenty to look at. Much of the film's big set pieces have a grandiose quality to the them, a certain fanfare, if you will, with due credit to Danny Elfman, whose scores are always so quintessential to Burton's tone. Everywhere else, however, it's hard to find intrigue or anything compelling in these characters and their dilemmas.<br/><br/>Burton appears to channel all his energy into the aesthetic of ""Dark Shadows,"" something that could be argued as the downfall of a lot of his other lesser works. It's as though everything rides on the script in his films, an arena he has generally avoided in terms of the creative process. If he's picked strong source material that's adapted well, the aesthetic that he brings makes his film a winner. If that core is weak, then he goes down with it. ""Dark Shadows"" is one of those more hollow stories and it shows.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com"

","As with all Tim Burton and Johnny Depp films, I was excited to see this. I thought the idea of bringing back Barnabas Collins was a great idea and hoped it would live up to the highly-praised standards of the original TV series. Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br/><br/>It seemed as though this movie couldn't decide where it wanted to go. At one moment, it was about the battle between Barnabas and Angelique; the next, it was about Barnabas' infatuation with Bella, who we hardly saw at all in the movie once Barnabas was introduced. The entire plot was a mess.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the level of sexuality in this PG-13 movie. Who thought it was a good idea to insert a comment about a 15 year old and what she does when she's alone? I was also disappointed with the fact that Barnabas was portrayed as a vampire who apparently had trouble keeping it in his pants.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was a complete failure. I was hoping they'd simply try to put a new spin on a show that was once greatly loved. Apparently not. Don't bother seeing this movie unless you haven't got a clue about the original Dark Shadows and simply like riding on the Burton/Depp train."

","Could you imagine if Tim Burton cast Johnny Depp as Beetlejuice instead of Michael Keaton? The movie would not have even been close to being good. However thankfully Tim Burton cast perfectly and is still one of my favorite movies to date. Now why oh why doesn't Tim Burton look at his previous works and actually analyze what made them great so he can repeat? I can't believe that he actually ""wants"" to make bad movies. In contrast Johnny Depp was perfect for Edward scissor hands. Of course he was... Johnny Depp is a great actor, but even the greatest actors can't do every single character in every single movie. I mean, what if Tom Hanks or Robin Williams or Johnny Depp was cast as Beetlejuice? See my point? It would have sucked. Never having seen the original series, I had nothing to compare this movie too. It didn't have to ""live up"" to anything in my mind and yet it was still shallow and unimpressive. It wasn't really all that funny, some parts were but I didn't utter anything more than a forced chuckle. It really wasn't that dark because of the constant air of trying to be funny and charming but failing at that, which took away from the darkness. I was pretty disappointed. If Mr. Burton is going to use the same overall ""gothic comedy"" theme, and use the same talent over and over, well then he had better find some way to improve upon his past genius."

","Based on all the previews, one would think that this was a remake of Love at First Bite - a fish-out-of-water comedy, with Barnabas coming to terms with 1972. These trailer scenes probably make up 80% of those jokes for the movie. It is not a comedy that the trailers would leave you to believe.<br/><br/>Overall it is a quirky retelling of some of the elements from the original series. I did enjoy it for what it was. You do have to go in with the expectation that this is a Burton/Depp film. Johnny seems to play one character for Burton - pauses in his speech, some weird walking movements, and lots of hand waving. A little more of a darker side would have fit this film perfectly. <br/><br/>While the rest of the cast does a good job (Michelle is great as a matriarch) the biggest problem I had is that characters appear when needed and then go away for long spells. I had almost forgotten that Victoria was a role she was off screen so much. Same with a few of the other supporting characters.<br/><br/>Don't expect anything super serious or super funny."

","From director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) this film has all his usual ingredients, his recurring cast members including horror film stars, and the Gothic element mixed with dark humour, and it is based on a classic Gothic soap opera, so I was looking forward to watching it. Basically the story opens in the year 1760, the Collins family migrate from Liverpool, England to Maine, America, and the parents Joshua (Ivan Kaye) and Naomi (Susanna Cappellaro) build the fishing port city Collinsport, a few years later the Collins son Barnabas (Johnny Depp) seduces family maid and witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), but he tells her that he doesn't love her. Rich playboy Barnabas falls in love with the young and beautiful Josette Du Pres (Bella Heathcote) and they marry very happily, but Angelique is furious with jealousy, and she kills his parents and her former lover's new wife, and she curses him to become an immortal vampire so he will live forever in misery, and she has him buried alive. Two centuries later, 1972, the Collins family still live in Collinwood Manor: mother and wife Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), her brother Roger (Trainspotting's Jonny Lee Miller), Elizabeth's rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn (Kick-Ass's Chloë Grace Moretz), and Roger's young son David (Gulliver McGrath), and also David's psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) and mansion caretaker Willie Loomis (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Jackie Earle Haley), and they are joined by governess and Josette's reincarnation Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote). Construction workers accidentally unearth the coffin of Barnabas and he breaks out, he firstly has to end his long hunger sucking the blood of those that rescued him, and then he makes his way to mansion where he can meet his dysfunctional descendants, and after convincing Elizabeth of his identity and revealing a secret family treasure in a secret room behind the fireplace he is allowed to stay, under the condition he will not reveal the fortune or his vampire state. He finds out that the family business is near bankruptcy, and he plans to help restore the family fortunes, but this will not easy because he has to go against the successful rival fishery Angel Bay, and he is devastated to know it was established by Angelique, who has still somehow eternally beautiful, and he rejects her advances again because he is in love with Victoria. After various strange events and happenings of Barnabas trying to learn more about the modern world, and revealing his secrets to Dr. Hoffman in hypnosis, the big plan to restore the family status is to have a big party in the mansion, and the guest performer coming is heavy metal star Alice Cooper, and it is there that Victoria reveals that before becoming governess she was in an insane asylum because she could see and talk to a ghost, the spirit of Josette. We see Hoffman convince Barnabas that if he tries blood transfusions this may help him become human again, but in fact she is using his blood to become a vampire and stop her ageing, and when he finds out he drains her blood and throws her into the ocean, and we see him talk to Roger to pay more attention to David and he gives him the choice to leave or to stay, he chooses to leave and David is devastated. It is when rescuing David from a falling disco ball that all the rest of the family find out that Barnabas is a vampire when his skin is burning in the sunlight, Victoria is also shocked, so he is forced to leave and later at night he goes to Angelique, and their last encounter they made love, that he regretted almost immediately after, and she gets him to admit that he murdered Dr. Hoffman, which is recorded, and he is trapped in another coffin to be buried, and she burns down the Collinsport factory, and to give her extra cover she plays the recording to the police so that everyone will hate the Collins family. A mob are gathered to go and arrest the family, but David releases Barnabas, and when he returns to the mansion to fight Angelique they both reveal their true natures, including beautiful face cracking, scaring away the townspeople, and she manages to set the mansion on fire and admits the curse she put upon the family, including killing David's mother and turning Carolyn into a werewolf. Eventually David summons the vengeful ghost of his mother and she screams forcing Angelique to be knocked into the chandelier, before dying the witch pulls out and offers her heart to Barnabas, but he refuses it and shatters it, and she dies, but then he finds out she bewitched Victoria just like Josette to go and jump off the same cliff to die. Barnabas arrives just in time to save Victoria and wakes her up from the hypnosis, but in fact she wanted to jump on her own accord, she wants to be a vampire too, and when he refuses she jumps, and follows her to bite her neck and save her life, and she wakes up as a vampire on the rocks below, the two wake up and kiss, and just before the end we see Hoffman wake up underwater. Also starring Thomas McDonell as Young Barnabus Collins, Sir Christopher Lee as Clarney, Jonathan Frid as Guest, David Selby as Guest, Shane Rimmer as Board Member 1 and Michael Shannon as Board Member 2. Depp is terrific as the English vampire with great charm and a naive approach to the modern world, Green is enthusiastic playing the playfully evil witch, and the rest of the cast including Pfeiffer and Carter get their good moments too, Burton makes sure that there are dark, funny and serious moments throughout, a sort of love story, a family matters plot, and the mix of good and evil clashing, it all completes a satisfying and fun horror comedy drama. Good!"

Returning to his ancestral home, he then aids his dysfunctional descendants.<br/><br/>There were lots of things I liked here; the special effects were kinda dazzling including Johnny playing dress up (again) and damn did I ever laugh at that violent love scene (up and down the walls). The fact that it took place in the 70's was fun, groovy baby, and Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job as the family matriarch.<br/><br/>Watching Barnabas struggle in this modern world was also initially amusing but truthfully most of the really good bits were shown with the trailers on TV.

The quirkiness attends to Burton's reputation, even though the make-up and sets seem to be recycled from previous projects. Depp gets to feed his addiction to playing pasty, cartoon-ish characters. The producers get to cash in on fans of the TV show, even if it means forsaking something like having the plot gel. Johnny Lee Miller continues to set new records for a good actor choosing bad projects.<br/><br/>Victoria is hired as the nanny to little David - though we never see them in a scene together. One ghost appears regularly but is usurped at the end by another ghost who is unfortunately very similar to the first ghost, causing momentary confusion. Apparently Barnabus is in love with Victoria, but all the sex he has is with two other women. At least gratuitous vampire sex is something I've never seen in a film.<br/><br/>Depp has a few funny lines, but the family is too big and spread too thin on this canvas for the audience to care about anyone. Michelle Pfieffer seems to be there simply to have her name on the poster. Barnabus is in love with a woman who is now a ghost leading another woman to him that he can love as a surrogate except she will also die... huh? Last of all, the setting up of a sequel with the final shot is crass.<br/><br/>Completely missable."

","LOGLINE: In the 1770's the wealthy Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is cursed to spend eternity as a vampire by his lovesick servant and secret witch, Angelique (Eva Green). Upon discovery of his new affliction Collins is buried alive by the townspeople, and spends nearly two centuries underground until he is accidentally dug up by the construction crew building a new restaurant called McDonald's. Collins discovers times have changed as his family heirs are struggling to get by and the witch is now the most powerful and popular woman in town.<br/><br/>Yesthis is the actual premise that some Hollywood jerkoff thought would be a great movie to throw millions of dollars at to get made. Dark Shadows, based on the marginal late 60's/early 70's Gothic soap opera, is basically the story of what happens to a 18th century vampire who wakes up in the 1970's after a 200-year sleep. Jokes about all things the 70's decade had to offer are constantly thrown at the audience and the gag runs thinvery quickly.<br/><br/>The all-star cast struggles to find their footing, and the story plot is underdeveloped and pushed to the side to make way for the generic jokes that don't stick. Tim Burton seems to phone this one in. Burton's directorial detail and effort of his past classics such as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands are nowhere to be found in this one, but I guess that should be expected from a guy who made boring movies out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a misfire and a perfect example of how confused Hollywood currently is. When the mass audience already has a bloated belly full of vampire stories why trot out another movie that strips the genre of its essence and excitement? Maybe this will be the holy water or silver dagger that will be shanked through the heart of the current vampire trend and put us out of our misery.

","'Burton-esque' (bert-on-esk) adj. by-word in movie circles for being artistically quirky yet sumptuous, darkly comical, beautifully bizarre; usually unlike anything you've seen before. Ironically, it's been some time since Tim Burton has actually been Burton-esque, and his latest, Dark Shadows, is another plodding, repetitive entry into the Gothic director's canon. His unique taste in visuals is omnipresent, but there's just nothing new on offer; the set dressing – dauntingly big houses, ominous furniture – is strangely boring and the costumes are drearily typical. Perhaps the film's principal weakness – if not the utterly ludicrous finale – is his determination to employ the same actors he always collaborates with. Johnny Depp has stretched his idiosyncratic persona too thin and Helena Bonham Carter's bonkers-by-numbers shtick can only stay amusing for so long. If it wasn't for the handful of genuinely funny moments and the spot-on soundtrack this would have been completely irredeemable."

","Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is the son of a wealthy English family who move to Maine, USA in the late 18th Century. After spurning the affections of servant/secret with, Angelique (Eva Green) he falls in love with local girl Josette (Bella Heathcote). Angelique, unable to bear seeing someone else with Barnabas, kills his parents and Josette and turns Barnabas into a vampire. 200 years later it's 1972 and Barnabas is unearthed from a coffin which the townsfolk placed him in and attempts to reconnect with his living family and rebuild the great Collins name.<br/><br/>Tim Burton appears to be on a bad run at the moment. His last two films 9 and Alice in Wonderland were critical failures though Alice proved to be extremely popular at the box office. It is my feeling that Burton is currently favouring style over substance and that is evident in his latest offering. Tim Burton has no trouble creating beautifully odd looking sets, characters and films but it is one thing to make a film that 'looks Tim Burton' and another to make a film that is any good. The film has all the Gothic grace of Tim Burton's finest and he manages to meld this with a 70s look which works quite well. Details of both periods look great and work well together. The set dressing, clothes and music are all spot on. Where the film falls down is in the plot.<br/><br/>Firstly it makes no sense and there are more plot holes than a machine gunned Swiss cheese. Barnabas, an only child, is killed in the late 1700s, long after the death of his parents yet 200 years later his family is alive and well. Where they came from is never explained. Another problem is that Eva Green's witch character has tried for 200 years to get rid of/keep the family out of the way. She is a witch and shows her power in numerous scenes but has still been unable to remove them. This doesn't make sense and in one scene late on it is shown that she is responsible even for improving the survival chances of one family member. A further problem is that the character of Josette and the 1970s nanny Victoria are played by the same actress and one is followed by the other's ghost. The reasons for this were never explained and made absolutely no sense. Another problem which bothered me though probably doesn't matter in America is that Barnabas is meant to be from Liverpool but speaks with the same non-descript English accent that most American actors use.<br/><br/>Other than major plot holes the plot itself is thinner than tracing paper. It was really boring and I didn't care about any of the characters. It wasn't funny enough either. I sniggered a couple of times but didn't laugh once and I wasn't alone. Even during the funniest parts, the audience I saw it with barely tittered. Along with being unfunny it also wasn't scary. For a comedy-horror really it should have been at least one or the other. The Woman in Black showed what can be done with a 12A/PG13 rating and this film came nowhere near to making me scared.<br/><br/>The actors were all generally quite good. Johnny Depp was fairly amusing with his from a different time bit, but it soon wore off. Overall though he was very good and carried the film. Chloe Moretz was also excellent, for once playing a normal teenager. She conveyed teen angst very well and made for a good sparring partner with Depp's Georgian vampire. Michelle Pfeiffer was also fine as the family matriarch though she didn't have much to do. Helena Bonham Carter was great but felt under used and Bella Heathcote felt a bit swamped by the exuberant characters and personalities around her. Eva Green was excellent as the witch. It was also nice to see Christopher Lee on screen, if only for a minute. The addition of Alice Cooper felt like when a TV show has run out of ideas so brings a star on to boost ratings. It felt very unrealistic to have him appear but it was only a matter of time before he did make an appearance in a Burton film.<br/><br/>Overall this is a film of style over substance and that puts Tim Burton in a bracket with Zach Snyder, somewhere he really doesn't want to be. It looks and sounds great, has some great acting and characters but suffers from a poor script, lack of laughs and scares.<br/><br/>www.attheback.blogspot.com"

I was unaware that Dark Shadows was a previous TV series so this is a review just of the movie. The movie lacked any direction or focus and just seemed to meander around trying to get to the next joke in which every punch line was already broadcast in the previews. Literally there was nothing new to the plot that wasn't spoiled in the previews.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was given no direction by Tim Burton and as a result he just revisited his Edward Scissorhands persona by holding his hands up in every scene and flicking his fingers around like they had uncomfortable poles attached to each finger. His role was aggressive and out-going character but retarded. A tiny Songstress in a box??? and why attack the box??? OK, I get zany but his role kept flipping from dark evil powerful to retarded 3 stooges zany. This did not work.<br/><br/>Go to watch Tim Burton's 70's sets and the fantastic bright yellow Chevy station wagon in the movie. Literally the only cringe for me during the entire movie is when they unloaded a coffin from the back of the station wagon and it looked like they may scratch the tail gate, no!!!!

","DARK SHADOWS, based loosely on the strange and unique Dan Curtis soap opera of yesteryear, has a new generation's Barnabas Collins played by Johnny Depp who, resembling Eddie Munster had he grown up a Beatle, is given a simple choice: love a jealous witch or, after being turned into a Vampire, pay the consequences. That being a two-hundred-year burial where he wakes up in 1972 (a year after the original show went off the air): his colonial world having been transformed into hot rod cars and rock music.<br/><br/>The continuous gag of the newly awakened vamp's dazed fascination with modern devices – from a television to a lava lamp – gets pretty tiresome. After the intriguing and rather spooky prologue followed by an ultraviolent massacre of those who awakened him, one might expect a more lethal antihero. And God knows Depp, lavishing the accent and prowess with his usual wily charm, deserves a darker ride. Playing a character that one-minute slaughters the innocent and the next is a lovable klutz, he seems a bit lost and incomplete. And director Tim Burton, a pioneer of mixing horror and comedy, is never quite sure which way to lean at the right moments.<br/><br/>And although our cunning antagonist Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green looking like Anne Hathaway) tries her best to sharpen those fangs with sexually driven rampage, this film remains a cartoon. Collins family members including Michelle Pfeiffer as the mansion mom and Chloë Grace Moretzas a mopey teen daughter (with a dark secret of her own) add only filler dialog to the proceedings. While the lovely Bella Heathcote, as Barnabus's love interest from both time periods and the character we follow into the modern story, is all but forgotten not long after the opening credits.<br/><br/>Yet despite the abundance of murky downtime, the finale, as the family bands together to protect their home, is, like the prologue, quite entertaining.

","First off, it is important to mention that I am an original Dark Shadows fan. After seeing the first preview, I realized that this was going to be more comedy than drama and not likely true to the original. OK. Reluctantly, I can accept the change of tone since I like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. So maybe it will be a good Tim Burton movie regardless of the changes. It wasn't. First off-it was sloooooow (up until the last 15 minutes). I like good exposition, but it seemed pointless and uninvolving. Secondly, the story jumped around all over the place. No real build to anything. I don't want to give any spoilers (as if there are some to give), but the guest star was more of a side track and of no real importance to the plot at all. It was filler as was most of the movie. You would think that out of a thousand episodes of the original show they could have put together a decent story. I really wanted to like it. I tried to find a few golden moments, but there really weren't any. It just felt like a mess. I give it 3 stars only because I did like Johnny Depp's performance and most of the actors seemed well cast. In addition, I want Tim Burton to keep making movies (just not ones like this). Nice try. Getting a better script would have helped."
"moviexclusive","7","12","27","10 May 2012"," As wonderful as Tim Burton-Johnny Depp collaborations come, this is a visually sumptuous treat with a delightfully eccentric performance by Depp
","Few director-star collaborations have been as fruitful as that of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, or for that matter quite so deliciously eccentric, and their eighth time together proves no different. <br/><br/>Never mind if you haven't any inkling of the cult '70s daytime soap opera on which this is based- a swiftly told prologue recalls the setup by telling of the Collins' voyage to America, their instrumental role in the founding of the Maine seaside town called Collinsport by starting up a successful fishery business, and most importantly, of their heir Barnabas' unfortunate run-in with a jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green). Spurned by Barnabas for another named Josette (Bella Heathcote), Angelique hypnotises her to throw herself off a cliff while turning Barnabas into a vampire and imprisoning him in a coffin.<br/><br/>It will be nearly two centuries later by the time some construction workers inadvertently free him, awakening Barnabas to an unfamiliar era where he promptly mistakes the golden arches of a McDonald's for Mephistopheles. That's not the end of the fish-out-of-water jokes that passes as humour- other than the anachronistic values about women and childbirth that Barnabas still clings to, he is just as out of step in front of a TV playing a Karen Carpenter show or among a bunch of hippies.<br/><br/>Fans of the original series may object to the deliberately campy tone that Burton and his screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (with an extra story credit to Burton's frequent writing partner John August) adopt for the movie, but those less bound by expectations will lap up Johnny Depp's delightfully quirky rendition of Barnabas. As always, Depp is a master at facial reactions, with every twitch and raised eyebrow perfectly calibrated to elicit maximum hilarity. Depp and Burton are fully aware of the campiness, but both embrace it so wholeheartedly that you can't quite help but be won by their fidelity. <br/><br/>There is also much more than just Barnabas' anachronism of course, with Smith giving the film its due weight in Barnabas' mission of restoring the former Collinwood empire to its former glory. Since locking Barnabas away, Angelique has spent her time building up her own booming fishing business. In the meantime, the Collins have been content to let their lives fall into decay like their sprawling mansion- among the dysfunctional members the matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), her dissolute brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), her impudent teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Roger's disturbed young son David (Gully McGrath).<br/><br/>However kooky they may be, Barnabas regards them one and all as family- and as Depp's opening voice-over emphasises, blood is indeed thicker than water. Burton-Depp's collaborations have always demonstrated a tremendous amount of heart for peculiar characters, and this latest reaffirms their love for characters of different quirks and idiosyncrasies.<br/><br/>Restoring the empire to its former lustre earns the ire of none other than Angelique itself, the ensuing love-hate relationship between the pair giving the film a mildly sexual edge as well as a thrilling climax which culminates in a visually sumptuous showdown. Admittedly the pace does amble on with little narrative tension for most of the movie, but Burton eventually satiates the thirst for bombast in summer audiences with an extended ending made with most of the film's inflated budget unheard of in the days of the TV series' miniscule own.<br/><br/>To be fair, some of that has obviously gone into the ornate sets by production designer Rick Heinrichs as well as the elaborate costumes designed by Colleen Atwood. As is Burton's signature, the imagery stands out as much as the characters do, and the finale is a perfect example of the visual richness of Burton's warped imagination brought to life with CGI. But Burton is not foolish enough to rely simply on these modern-day devices, relying too on good-old fashioned casting to ensure that his film is also a rapturous delight.<br/><br/>Any actor besides Depp would probably be upstaged by the fine female cast, each of whom shine not simply because of Atwood's colourful costumes. The standout would probably be Green, who plays Angelique with bewitching aplomb, projecting sass and menace with razor-sharp precision and setting off dangerous sparks with Depp as ex-lovers. With Green's showy performance, it's easy to ignore Pfeiffer's more understated but no less loopy own, the actress who once played Catwoman in Burton's 'Batman Returns' clearly relishing one of her best roles in recent years. Bonham Carter unfortunately gets sidelined in this film, her act as a neurotic shrink underwritten and quite out-of-place amidst the other unfolding plot lines.<br/><br/>Amidst the new faces, Burton also pays homage to the original actors of the TV series by inviting four of them- Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, Kathryn Leigh Scott and David Selby- to appear briefly in the film, as well as the era's definitive musician Alice Cooper for an extended cameo. Despite his irreverent take on the material, Burton is clearly in love with the artefacts of the '70s, and the film's awesome soundtrack with the likes of Moody Blues and the Carpenters is testament to that.<br/><br/>So yes, fans of the TV series will have to accept that this big-screen adaptation is a reimagining of the original. Yet for those without that historical baggage, it is with any of the Burton-Depp collaborations that have come before it a thoroughly enjoyable visual feast filled with offbeat characters that turn out ghoulishly endearing. This is clearly a passion project for both Depp and Burton, and 'Dark Shadows' as its deliberately idiosyncratic title suggests is an unusual summer season offering that packs its own unique brand of kooky appeal."
"DamnYouGoogle","4","9","19","20 May 2012"," Tim+Johnny, for better or for worse.
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp feed off each other immensely as working partners and have developed what I can only assume to be a legitimate close friendship over the years. Due to their friendship Hollywood has seen some of the most incredible and original motion pictures over the 90's and 2000's. Im not saying they cant work apart thats not the case at all. Im actually saying they work together so much they might want to be caviler in choosing projects to work on.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a disappointment for many reasons, and after collaborations between Burton and Depp such as Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow, one has to wonder why this was ever even made. The script doesn't only not work on any real level, its pace is horrible and the film cant decide what it wants to be at all. Dark Shadows cant even decide if it wants the main character in the film Branabus (Played by Depp) to be liked or not, he goes from goofy to high class to murderer in a eye blink and it all comes off flat.<br/><br/>Another big problem Dark Shadows has is it never fleshes out any side plot. Like the side plot is glanced at for like a scene then it just pops back in 25 minutes later and you are like ""Oh thats what that random scene 25 minutes ago was about.<br/><br/>Other times things just seem forgotten completely. I swear I forgot Bella Heathcote was in the film at on point and she is the love interest, and I didn't forget because I was ""Caught up in the thrill ride that is Dark Shadows."" I forgot because she disappeared for a good 35 minutes and she isn't doing anything during that time, not in danger or kidnapped just kinda goes off screen and comes back later, as to say ""Did I miss anything?. No, Bella. You missed nothing.<br/><br/>Much like The Avengers people fight for shoehorned screen time unlike The Avengers the screenplay isn't fan friendly at all so aside from some beautiful filming techniques the film has nothing to offer.<br/><br/>If you a Depp fan, Phiffer fan, or A die hard fan of Burton ascetics as a director I guess its worth a watch, but as a film that stands alone its not funny, its not scary, and its not engaging. Its nothing really, you would expect more from Depp and Burton at least a little more.<br/><br/>3.5/10"
"martys-7","1","7","14","11 November 2012"," Flat, Boring, Pointless -- A Total Waste
","A campy performance by J.Depp, a strong supporting cast, some cool and fun special effects here and there, and jokes about the early 70s popular trends cannot save this movie from being one of 2012's worst releases.<br/><br/>There are no thrills, there is very little action, there are very few funny moments, the pace is slow, there is no character development, the plot is thin and not clever. Even a performance by Alice Cooper is boring and goes nowhere.<br/><br/>The original soap opera -- despite the unintended campiness of the supernatural mumbo-jumbo story lines -- at least had some character development and a relentless tension making it ABC's most watched show during its heyday in the late 1960s. Of significance is the fact that the series had dream sequences, morphing, etc., all done with the limitations of being a daytime soap with one-shot takes that went straight from live to tape. Sadly, Tom Burton spent millions of dollars on 21st century digital technology for special effects and came up with a boring, pointless film which is neither a campy comedy nor a supernatural thriller.<br/><br/>There was a 1991 short-lived miniseries which had a compelling cast (Ben Cross, a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt), solid plot lines (for a supernatural story), and a taut, tense pace filled with action, sex, and horror. Watch that one and pass on this turkey."

","This movie was one of my all time favorites! It had quite a few similarities to the 1966 Dark Shadow series. But they brought it up to date and made it from a excellent T.V. Show to a must see amazing movie! Johnny Depp was the perfect choice for Barnubus and portrayed him in every way! Overall I would recommend this to all my friends as a must see! Tim Burton made everything go together so nicely in this movie and the stars that play the part fit their parts perfectly as I am a fan of the Dark Shadows Series and I must say I am VERY impressed with this movie! I don't think that there is anything that I didn't like and would ever think of changing! Now I'm just hoping for a sequel! Again I saw it's a must see!"
"blanbrn","10","11","25","11 May 2012"," Blood is thicker than water, a fang of a good time! Excellent take on the Gothic classic.
","I for one am one of the biggest Tim Burton fans the man who brought us the classics ""Batman""(1989) and ""Batman Returns""(1992)really blends emotions and the inner feelings to make excellent movies. As his dark and Gothic mood tone will make any viewer enchanted. And with this work an update and more modern version of the TV soap ""Dark Shadows"" Tim clearly did not let anyone down! ""Dark Shadows"" is an excellent take and spin on the Gothic classic and Tim's story is filled with a journey and search for family and love plus the comedy and horror mix make the film very interesting to anyone. And the film is a pop culture piece for the way it blends music and style of it's setting of 1972 it's a rock and roll all night good time. As anyone knows who watches Burton's movies they are full of fun and expressions always revealing inner feelings and emotions his works can really change one's view of the world. And the all star cast makes the film work even more as two Tim favorites Johnny Depp(Barnabas Collins)and Michelle Pfeiffer(Elizabeth Collins Stoddard)shine with star power.<br/><br/>The film has a story in a historical and Gothic kind of way starting in 1752 in Liverpool, England a young Barnabas(Depp)suffers some fatal tragedies at the hands of a curse put out by a sexy yet jealous witch Angelique Bouchard(Eva Green). Yet after many many decades of being buried the film flashes to it's present day of 1972 and the culture is captured in the film perfect by the use of 70's music and style as the furniture and the clothing from the 70's is noticeable. And a nice little appearance from 70's legend Alice Cooper is A okay. And Barnabas meets his ancestral descendants that being the wealthy and rich Collins family of Collinsport, Maine a seaside and shoreline fishing community as this business has brought the Collins clan their millions. Yet arriving is a mysterious girl Victoria Winters/Josette(Bella Heathcote) who becomes a guest to the Colins family and this arrival has pleased Barnabas. The bad news is the sexy yet wicked witch but breakable beauty Angelique(Eva Green)has arrived in town with her curse. To help both defeat the wicked witch is the Collins Stoddard family as Michelle Pfeiffer is elegant and sexy in a classic kind of way and in top notch form as family head leader Elizabeth and true this a strange bunch as Elizabeth's daughter Carolyn(Chloe Grace Moretz) is a certain little hand full and family head doctor Julia Hoffman(Helena Bonham Carter) needs medication herself.<br/><br/>Overall this horror comedy drama is full of laughs, love, culture, and searching for belonging and acceptance still it closes the historical Gothic story out to a happy ending. The performances from Depp and Pfeiffer were top notch and perfect and again Tim sends a message and he proves with this film that family and belonging is important and too it's okay to be different! ""Dark Shadows"" was one feel good viewing pleasure."

Compared to Sweeney Todd, it's a classic. Compared to Casablanca? It's pretty awful. But isn't that what we go to movies for? Mindless escape into someone else's story other than our own???

"tbmforclasstsar","4","5","9","14 May 2012"," Slow pacing, empty story keep ""Dark Shadows"" from ever delivering any real excitement
","With last week's The Avengers shattering box office records, it's safe to say the summer blockbuster season has started. While 2011′s blockbusters failed to bust any blocks, this year is shaping up to be almost too overloaded with highly anticipated films coming out one week after the other. Among them is Tim Burton's eighth collaboration with his muse, Johnny Depp, in the film adaptation of Dark Shadows, a cult soap opera from the late 60s. Unfortunately, the film doesn't quite live up to the expectations some may have had, and instead we are given a slow, surprisingly dull, melodramatic film that never really commits itself to be funny or scary, and ends up being neither.<br/><br/>What should be addressed first is the fact that this is an adaptation of a soap opera. While I don't necessarily subscribe to the belief that there are some films that should be aborted before they are ever produced (I think with the right finesse, any film has the potential to be good), this is one adaptation that seems just a tad unnecessary, especially since a couple movies and a few television reboots (one starring a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt) have already been made. I understand Depp and Burton were both big fans of the show, and I understand that there is a cult following. But the problem you run into when you adapt a soap opera is that soap operas are not all that visually interesting to begin with. That is not to say that the film itself is visually boring. In fact, that's all it really has going for it most of the time. But there is very little action or story progression in a soap, and the languid pace of a daily daytime television series seems to have found its way into this adaptation.<br/><br/>In screen writing, it's a well known lesson to avoid scenes where characters do nothing more than talk to each other. It's referred to as ""talking heads"" and it's one of the least interesting ways to present characters or story to your audience. This is all soap operas do, mostly due to the fact that they have to drag out a story for five episodes every week. And that's the trap the film Dark Shadows falls into. In its close to two hour running time, it feels like nothing really happens to anyone. Characters barely change, the conflict barely rises, and in the end, it all feels rushed to have some sort of resolution. In my opinion, these problems all stem from the source material. Even with its 1,225 episodes, there simply isn't enough happening in the story to support a film.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/dark- shadows/"
"Phantasma_the_Black","6","5","9","13 May 2012"," Lighthearted and entertaining
","I went to a cinema without high expectations, since I didn't enjoy Burton's latest work 'Alice in Wonderland'; however, I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, it isn't a masterpiece, or as brilliant as some of the Burton's best work, such as 'Ed Wood', but it was entertaining enough. I haven't watched the original series, so maybe I'm not competent enough to judge, but I must say that as a fan of classical vampire movies (and novels), I wasn't disappointed. Yes, it's a comedy, but not a slapstick kind of comedy. And, yes, it actually does have that dark Gothic appeal which is desired in this type of movie.<br/><br/>Depp delivers a standard good performance; however, there is nothing especially new, iconic or unique about it. In my opinion, Eva Green stands out and quite possibly steals the show. As for the rest of the cast, they all did pretty much impressive job, especially Michelle Pfeiffer.<br/><br/>Visuals are stunning, as usual when it comes to Tim Burton. Soundtrack is amazing as well: a perfect combination of Danny Elfman's original score and songs popular at the time.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS BELOW*<br/><br/>I expected this movie to be a typical 'good guy vs. bad guy' (or in this case 'bad girl') flick and one of the biggest reasons why I was pleasantly surprised is that it didn't turn out to be like that. Many characters are 'evil' in different ways and almost all of them have some dark secrets. Sure, Angelique did some pretty nasty stuff, but in the end the audience can sympathize with her (just as they can sympathize with Gary Oldman's Dracula). After all, most of her evil actions were caused by an unrequited love. In the end, Barnabas told her she was incapable of love, but I think that she proved him wrong by (literally) giving him her heart. On the other hand, Barnabas was almost as mean as Angelique. I'm not talking about him killing the construction workers and hippies; after all he's a vampire and that's his way of survival. However, I didn't think what Julia had done was so unforgivable and that he justifiably killed her. Yes, she tried to use him (for both sexual and 'immortal' purposes), but she did that because she was messed up and generally weak, not because she had genuinely evil intentions. Also, using hypnosis on a loyal fisherman in order to change his mind and having sex with Angelique to ""save Vicky's honor"" (what the!) wasn't very honorable of him. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind Barnabas being mean, I actually like it; I just didn't see that coming in this kind of move.<br/><br/>I find the whole 'Carolyn turning into werewolf' thing somewhat forced and rushed and I wish they had more time to develop that subplot or to remove it completely.<br/><br/>Ending with Vicky begging Barnabas to bite her and him first refusing and then doing it when she's about to die kind of reminded me of those 'Twilight' movies (which I absolutely dislike), but luckily it lasts for only a couple of minutes and doesn't ruin the whole experience. And those who haven't seen 'Twilight' most likely wouldn't mind that scene at all.<br/><br/>In the end, I have to say that 'Dark Shadows' isn't a film that will stay in your mind for a long time or haunt your dreams, but given a fair chance, it can make you laugh and amuse you for two hours.<br/><br/>I give it 6/10."
"3xHCCH","7","15","37","10 May 2012"," A Beautiful and Charming Gothic Film Despite the Derivative Script
","I admit I am a bit wary about Tim Burton and his quirky dark films, some of which I did not really like too much. However with so much advanced hype about this particular collaboration with Johnny Depp, I felt compelled to watch it. I am happy I did. It was certainly one of the most visually-stimulating fantasy-black comedies I have seen, since maybe ""Death Becomes Her."" <br/><br/>The story of ""Dark Shadows"" begins in the 18th century when the Collins family crossed the Atlantic to begin their fishing business in Maine. Love-struck maid Angelique (Eva Green) took a fancy to the Collins scion Barnabas (Johnny Depp). Her love remained unrequited though because Barnaby became enamored with sweet Josette (Bella Heathcote). With the traditional fury expected from a woman scorned, Angelique resorted to powerful black magic to kill Josette and turn Barnaby into a vampire. The main story picks up 200 years later in 1972, when Barnabas was released from his grave by a road crew. He not only meets the very dysfunctional current generation of Collins, he also meets Angelique again! It seems that this witch also survived the centuries past, and is now the CEO of the competitor fishing company, Angel Bay. So, will Angelique finally possess Barnabas' love? Or will the pretty doe-eyed governess Victoria (also Heathcote) succeed to win him back, where her look-alike Josette failed 200 years ago?<br/><br/>A lot of the charm came from the cast who played their characters in this dark comedy so tongue-in-cheek, it was delightful. Johnny Depp, playing an undead character from 200 years ago waking up again in 1972, so funny as he encounters recent inventions. Eva Green, I have never seen her attack a role with this much ooomph and passion before. I have seen her before drably playing characters before in films like ""The Dreamers,"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""Casino Royale."" This turn as Angieis a high point in her acting career. <br/><br/>I had never seen Bella Heathcote act in anything before, but I understand how Barnabas could be so mesmerized by her beauty. Of course it won't be a Tim Burton without Helena Bonham-Carter, and here she plays a trippy redhead psychiatrist. I do not always like her characters before, but here she is also so funny! The other supporting characters played by Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earl Haley and the kids were not so remarkable. The character twist that involves the daughter Carolyn was so sudden and out-of-the-blue that it does not really contribute much to the improvement of the story.<br/><br/>For me, the best feature of this film is its amazing look. The visual effects, costumes and set design were all top-notch. They set the mood and the period of the story very effectively. And the soundtrack of early 70s songs, beginning with ""Nights in White Satin"" over the opening credits, wow! The song choices were unexpected, surprising and nostalgic at the same time. <br/><br/>Despite my raves, I know this film will not really appeal to all sectors. I found out during the credits that this was based on a TV show. I had not see this since the series was from the late 60s so I would not know how faithful this film was to its inspiration. I enjoyed it a lot. I found it very well-conceptualized and well-executed, despite the shortcomings of the script. I must admit the derivative script is not really the highlight of this film. It seems it contains various elements which had been bits and pieces of several ghost and vampire films we have seen before. Much to my chagrin, the violent make- out scene and the final conversation on the cliff edge came straight out of the ""Twilight"" films! However, the film as a whole was just very beautiful to watch, in a Gothic and eerie sort of way. Just don't expect too much, sit back and enjoy it!"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","8","17","13 May 2012"," 1972 and not one cameo appearance by Blackula? Tim, when did you stop having fun?
","Boy, is there anything Tim Burton and Johnny Depp won't do together? This is the ultimate bromance I've ever heard of. Tim Burton is a good director, but even more of a great visualist and story teller. He has some really terrific and unique ideas and the reason he's praised by a lot of fans is because he's different and doesn't bend over for studios, he knows his audience and loves them. But when it comes to him remaking or rebooting something like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Planet of the Apes, Alice in Wonderlandhe's not as strong and focused. When he has his own ideas, he knows how to get the point across, but someone else's ideas, he doesn't seem to know how to take control and seems to be a fan boy more than how to keep the story straight. So he's given us Dark Shadows, a cult favorite show from the 70's. I didn't watch the entire TV series, but remember watching it as a kid on TV Land and loving the spooky feeling it gave me. Tim Burton instead of going with the dark story line, gives us The Addams Family Revisited.<br/><br/>In 1760, Barnabas Collins is a wealthy playboy in Collinsport and is the master of Collinwood Manor. He breaks the heart of a witch, Angelique, who kills his parents, curses his family, and has his lover leap to her death from a nearby cliff and finally turns Barnabas into a vampire and buries him alive in a chained coffin in the woods. In 1972, Barnabas is accidentally freed from his coffin by a group of construction workers. He drains their blood and makes his way back to Collinwood Manor where he finds his once-magnificent mansion in ruin. The manor is currently occupied by Barnabas' dysfunctional descendants. Barnabas decides to restore his family name, but when Angelique discovers that he has escaped his shallow grave, she plots revenge and tries to win him back.<br/><br/>There are good points in the film like Johnny Depp's performance, which he seemed to have a bit of fun with this role. Not his strongest performance, but much better than what he's been doing this past year. He just clicks better with stranger roles for some reason. Michelle Pfeiffer, who seriously must've sold her soul to the devil to look that amazing at 54 years old, does give it her all. The cinematography is just beautiful and the castle looks amazing and almost takes you back into the Hammer horror movies, speaking of which had a nice touch on having the film poster Dracula AD 1972 in the background at the movie theater and then have Christopher Lee being hypnotized by Johnny Depp. The jokes despite falling flat after a while provide a good laugh.<br/><br/>We have an excellent cast and it feels like most of them really go to waste. Chloë Grace Moretz, who I really like, could've been a more interesting character but falls flat and randomly without explanation becomes a werewolf at the end. Jackie Earle Haley is a drunk, Helena Bonham Carter is a tired alcoholic hag who wants to live forever and Jonny Lee Miller is a greedy unclethat's it for their screen time. I would've loved to see more focus on the family vs. Barnabas and Angelique going at it every five minutes of her begging for him back and him saying no constantly. Tim Burton had some good ideas for this one, but like most of his remakes or reboots, he didn't fully get the original message and didn't know where to go with this one. He makes Barnabas into a monster, then wants you to love him because he's cursed and trying to be good, but then murders people who try to help him, but he's so good with his niece and nephew that you have to love him again. I'm not surprised that not as many people are liking this as they expected it would, from the trailer, this seemed a little too goofy and off from the original series. I was just hoping that Tim and Johnny would've put a little more thought into this one, we could've used a great reboot to this cool, but dated TV series. But given some credit, at least they used a real vampire, Alice Cooper, who is 140 years old and is still rocking like he's 20! <br/><br/>6/10"
"changmoh","7","14","35","9 May 2012"," Not his Best, but Burton is Still Entertaining
","Back in 1966, decades before ""True Blood"", ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"", America had a supernatural TV series called ""Dark Shadows"". This series, which ran up to 1971, was centred on Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire played by Jonathan Frid (who died after this movie was filmed). Curiously, this campy series had such an influence on director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp that they decided to make a modern version of it.<br/><br/>The result is this lavish production that has Depp playing Barnabas Collins as a 200-year-old vampire who wakes up in 1972 and is forced to navigate an era of hippies, pot, disco and free love. With its clock set in the Seventies, I suspect the movie will resonate better with the older viewers than the youngsters.<br/><br/>A voice-over prologue relates how the Collins family moved from decadent Liverpool to Maine, in the New World, circa 1795. The family set up a fishing industry in a town named after themselves: Collinwood. Just when the future seemed bright for Barnabas (Depp), a love triangle involving a witch (Eva Green as Angelique), and Barnabas' girlfriend Josette (Bella Heathcote) turned tragic - sending Josette to her watery grave and turning Barnabas into a vampire. Angelique then set the townsfolk on Barnabas who was captured and buried alive.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to 1972 and we find young Victoria Winters (Heathcote, again) arriving at Collinwood Mansion to take up a position as governess to David Collins (Gully McGrath), nephew of matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer). Also staying at the mansion are Elizabeth's brother, Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her impudent teen daughter, Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and child psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter). Meanwhile, construction workers unearth Barnabas' coffin and resurrects him...<br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" is certainly not among the best of Burton's films and neither is it among Depp's greatest efforts. However, the weird and offbeat Burtonesque ambiance and tone are evident and coupled with notable performances by the cast, it is an entertaining effort. The gags that sent our preview audience into laughter and guffaws involve Barnabas' view of the 'modern' world of the Seventies. The vampire is intrigued by lava lamps and the songs of Karen Carpenter, whom he thinks also deals in woodwork. And yes, he also thinks Alice Cooper is the ugliest woman he has ever seen.<br/><br/>Burton puts the Seventies hit songs to good use, evoking nostalgia and a sense of campiness among the audience. One of the pleasures of watching a Burton movie is seeing Depp in his deadpan, tongue-in-cheek role, setting a jocular mood to the proceedings. His violent love tryst with Eva Green's sexy Angelique is a highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Another delight is Chloe Moretz who delivers some of the juiciest lines. Among the flaws are Barnabas' inconsistent reactions to sunlight and other vampire clichés which I prefer to overlook. Overall, a nice change from the ""Twilight"" offerings.

Depp, An Acting God, lives the an unlikely protagonist in the most attractive manner. Depp is masterful all through. Eva Green has never been this evil before & she is absolutely delicious in here. She's twisted, wicked & ruthless, delivering a career-best turn. Bella Heathcote is fabulous. Michelle Pfeiffer lends grace to her character. Helena Bonham Carter is always flawless. Jackie Earle Haley is decent. Chloë Grace Moretz has emerged into a terrific performer & she does exceedingly well. Gulliver McGrath is perfect. The Magnificent Christopher Lee appears in a cameo.<br/><br/>Call it flawed & dark, I enjoyed Burton's interpretation of a complicated tale lasting centuries & Depp's masterful take on a cursed vampire. Strongly Recommended!"

","When Burton and Depp get it right it's an Edward Scissorhands, when they get it wrong it's a Dark Shadows. Burtons films are never ""bad"", though Alice in Wonderland and Planet of the Apes weren't good, Dark Shadows just doesn't really deliver when it really could of.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the character well, but I think an English actor would have been better cast, as his accent sounds forced a lot of the time. Michelle Pfeiffer is usually fabulous but is just reduced to nothing here, and her chemistry with Depp is far more enticing than Depp's actual love interest, but it isn't explored.<br/><br/>The pacing is all over the place, when the film is funny, it does it quite well. But the humour is so rare, it doesn't know how to balance the horror and the comedy, leaving it feeling like two films squished into one. Depps delivery is solid as always, but I just didn't feel this was the right film role for him. I felt this way in Sweeney Todd, although I thought the performance was good I felt Depp was miscast due to his lack of singing talent.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is OK, it is entertaining and has genuinely great moments in it. But these moments are too few and far between."
"secondtake","6","6","12","16 May 2012"," Fans of the TV show beware. Burton fans beware. Depp fans, he's not bad!
","Dark Shadows (2012) A part spoof, part earnest (oddly) vampire movie with only a few of the twists and visual effects you'd expect from director Tim Burton. The year? 1971. The source? American television.<br/><br/>Mostly there's Johnny Depp, who again lifts his movie into something watchable. Depp's deadpan humor, with an old school British accent, is killer. He's a vampire, for sure (you can't see him in reflections, and he's not so good with sunlight) but he's got justice on his side, and a sense of family loyalty that goes beyond the Corleone flavor. He broods. He means well.<br/><br/>When Depp's character, Barnabas Collins, gets a second chance to win back his honor and his love, it's in coastal Maine, where his nemesis, a centuries old witch, runs the competing fishing cannery. Yes, there's some silliness here, but in movie form it's too grandiose. This is totally t.v. material and here it doesn't get funny or campy or weird enough to work.<br/><br/>There are some short scenes that are hilarious, like the lines about ""Love Story"" (which young viewers won't get) or when Collins tries to learn about contemporary life from some pretty convincing second-rate hippies. Sometimes it's a bit of special effects overkill with creatures coming to life from the woodwork of the old house, or with Helena Bonham Carter at something less than her best as a cookey psychoanalyst. (To be sure, when Carter is not her best, she's still pretty good.) Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful matriarch, and the evil witch is played with good bad energy by Eva Green.<br/><br/>The big problem? This is a Tim Burton movie that lacks the originality of something like ""Edward Scissorhands."" I mean, what was he thinking? Still, for pure mindless fun, especially if you don't know the t.v. show, it might be worth a drive-in kind of night out."

","I am a VERY easy grader on movies. As long as my mind is engaged and I don't find myself wondering about something else, a movie gets a pass from me. I literally lost interest in what happened about two-thirds way through the movie and agree with another poster that this movie was just all over the place without doing anything (as far as the plot goes) well. I have no problem with the performances and liked the cast. But I FAR more enjoyed catching SAFE for the third time than I enjoyed even the first two thirds of Dark Shadows. I found The Tourist, The Ninth Gate, and Sleepy Hollow 10 times as entertaining and would watch any of them over again once a year. Also, Pirates 4 which I had a bit of trouble with the first time through but since then have probably watched it a half dozen times with great appreciation. Loved Stardust and even Hocus Pocus. But I see no reason to ever watch this movie again. That is an incredibly harsh review from me!"

","In 1760 Liverpool (which we later learn reeked with the stench of un-dumped commodes), we meet the ""cursed"" Collins family. They move to Maine, successfully start a fishing business, and ""found"" the town of Collinsport. Grown up handsome son Johnny Depp (as Barnabas Collins) becomes a real lady killer. This irks sexy servant girl Eva Green (as Angelique ""Angie"" Bouchard), who yearned for Mr. Depp from their days in Liverpool. He soon finds ""true love"" with pretty blonde Bella Heathcote (as Josette DuPres). Jilted, Ms. Green turns out to be a witch. She turns Depp into a vampire and has him sealed in a chained coffin...<br/><br/>This set-up - all occurring before the opening credits - is fine, but offers some timing problems, especially when you consider later revelations. It seems like Depp had to be a vampire before he turns into one, and we aren't sure how it all went down. Possibly there is plot skimmed away, and this feeling continues throughout the film. After the prologue, credits roll and we are in the year 1972. The story shifts to Ms. Heathcote (as Maggie Evans) on a train. She's the mirror image of Depp's ""Josette"" from the past. Harboring a more modern mystery, Heathcote takes the name ""Victoria (Vicki) Winters"" from a train poster advertisement...<br/><br/>The story begins with the arrival of Heathcote to seek employment as governess, coupled with the unearthing and arrival of Depp. The film becomes mostly a situation comedy until the climax. Some of the jokes are funny - some are not. Two of the better characterizations are beautiful family matriarch Michelle Pfeiffer (as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) and troubled young nephew Gulliver McGrath (as David Collins). Depp falls somewhere in the middle. Dead-panning with amusing sincerity, he nevertheless is victimized by a lack of romantic development; increasingly hidden behind elaborate make-up, Depp hits the comic notes well, but he fails to make ""Barnabas"" a passionate lead. Director Tim Burton's quirk looks something like a slip. But the art and set direction are good.<br/><br/>***** Dark Shadows (5/7/12) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Bella Heathcote"
"iistyping","5","6","12","11 May 2012"," Eh.
","It's a decent enough movie, for a bit of entertainment. Not one I'd be see at the theatre twice though. I have several problems with it; the first being that pretty well all the funny jokes are in the trailer. And the rest are utterly predictable.<br/><br/>There is no real 'love' story as Johnny's character seems to fall for any woman who offers a sexual favour. Even the witch who cursed him and killed his one supposedly true love. I can't help but think it's not a movie about love but lust. It cheapens love stories and makes them unbelievable. The sexual jokes get old very fast and frankly, they are nauseating.<br/><br/>Subplots. A movie should only have them if it actually contributes to the plot. But they don't, and most of them are unexplained and unfulfilled, which made me feel like the movie wasn't finished when it did. I guess they could be setting up for a sequel :S <br/><br/>In the beginning Victoria's character seems very important, however after a brief introduction she is forgotten about for the next half hour; sitting in the background like an extra. She tells him the tragic story of her life then suddenly she and Barnabas are somehow in 'love'. The connection between Josette's ghost and her (especially having the same face) is never explained. Are they actually the same person, reincarnated or something?<br/><br/>On a positive note, the costumes were amazing and the sets were gorgeous... if only they didn't have to burn it down."

","""New film! Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Michelle Pfiffer, vampires; it must be great!"" That was basically the line of dialogue that went through my head while I watched the trailer for the first time. Now, I've been away at school, and since then, I haven't watched any television. I was shocked at how many things I was completely lost on! ""Dark Shadows"" was one of them. I had enough money to see ONE movie when I came home for the break, and I chose ""Dark Shadows"" because of the cast. This is my review. Please keep in mind, that I have not seen the original TV series. I hadn't heard of it until the movie came out.<br/><br/>Plot: I thought the plot was rather interesting, but with a star-studded cast, a plot isn't really necessary, right? Everyone just wants to see them interact with each other. The flashback in the beginning was nice, and set the mood very well. I was kind of disappointed with the loose ends they left. Not sure if they are opening for a sequel (I hope not) or what. Then again, Tim Burton likes to let your imagination do the work, so it may just be his artistic signature. Like with the entire Victoria/Barnabas romance? I understand that she's a doppelganger-type love (similar to Dracula), but it's rather spontaneous, and the entire plot at the end is rather unfulfilled, in my opinion. I think they mostly did it, because they couldn't come up with a good way to end it. :P Don't get me wrong, I thought it was entertaining to an extent. Most of the jokes fell short with me, but I was entertained by the situational humor. Watching Barnabas try to interact and blend in with the 70's was my favorite part of the film. However, I thought there were a lot of very unnecessary things in the film that put a damper on it; such as the sexual moments. I realize they're supposed to come across as humorous or ""O.o?!"", but for me, they were disappointing and ruined segments of the film. I thought it terribly unnecessary, distracting, and disgusting.<br/><br/>Characters: I am not a fan of Helena Bonham-Carter, but I very much enjoyed her character. (Minus the lewdness with Barnabas) The teenager in the house (whose name escapes me) was funny and not annoying. I especially loved the scene with her and Barnabas when he is seeking dating advice. The little line about 'birthing hips' had me in giggling fits. I ADORED Michelle Pfiffer's character. She starts out seeming to be with evil intentions, but in the end, she is the protective one. I really liked it. I thought everyone was cast well, minus Eva Green. She definitely looks the part, but when she opens her mouth, I found her annoying.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous Notes: Profanity wasn't horrible, I'm pleased by its absence. Random plot twist with the werewolf? Okay... *puzzled* Unresolved ending? Fine, fine, Timmy does that a lot. I found more humor in the situation and in the little expressions on character's faces much more than the actual pokes that were put into the script.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I give it a five. I found the plot to be rather boring, and I only stayed to watch the characters interact. I knocked it down from its original 7 because of my disappointment with the tasteless sex scenes. I'm starting to feel that Tim Burton should back off a bit, and concentrate on doing less films, but making them of higher quality."

","Yes, I was one of those running home from school to watch Dark Shadows each day! I bought the DVD collection and have my husband hooked on it now. I was almost afraid to see this movie after reading all of the early comments after seeing the trailers, but there was no way I would have missed it. What great fun! Except for a few character changes that I was not happy with, such as Julia Hoffman and Roger Collins, it was a wonderful and entertaining two hours! No one will ever replace the original but this was an excellent twist. I actually hated the House of Dark Shadows movie because it turned my favorite characters and the great story lines of the series into a mindless bloodbath. The Ben Cross revival mini series was lame compared to the original. This time, Burton and Depp took a different approach and added some comedy to balance the drama. Reminded me a bit of another favorite old movie of mine ... Love at First Bite. Add Alice Cooper to the mix and it was impossible for me not to love it! Hope there will be sequels! Orlando Bloom would make a great Quentin Collins!"
"ohtatyaro1","5","7","15","11 May 2012"," Decent but below any expectations
","This movie had all it takes for a good movie. A top-notch cast, a decent director and a successful TV show to build on. Sadly, all this potential was wasted due to a lousy script. The story is weak, the characters are superficial and unconvincing. No blame on the actors though, they did best they could with what they were given to work with.<br/><br/>The first few minutes of the movie play in the 18th century. Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), son of wealthy and successful parents has an affair with Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), a housemaid from humble home. He refuses to acknowledge her, unknowingly that she is a witch. In return, she kills his parents and his newly-married true love Josette (Bella Heathcote), turns him into a vampire and has him buried alive by a mob. All of this is rushed through in about five minutes and that is what it feels like. Rushed. Josette has literally one line to say before she is killed off, all of this appears unreal and laughable. It's like ""Oh Barnabas, promise to always stay with me /big eyes/"" (first line and last one, just saying) - ""Yes my true love, I swear, we are so in love, huh?"". I mean, come on. COME ON. That's all so unreal and unconvincing.<br/><br/>Anyway, plot continues 196 years later, in 1972. A bunch of construction workers stumbles over Barnabas coffin and releases him and he sets out to see whether the Collins family endured. They did. Elizabeth Stoddard (Pfeiffer) and her daughter Carolyn (Chloe Moretz), Elizabeth's brother Roger Collins (Lee Miller) and his son David (McGrath) still live in the Collins mansion. They are in company of psychiatrist Dr. Hoffmann (Bonham Carter), caretaker Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) and the new housemaid Vicky (Bella Heathcote, again). The family business however is going bad, let's say not going at all and the family fortune is gone. All of them has their own problems, in one way or another. Barnabas decides to get the old family business going again, only to find out soon enough that Angelique who cursed him two hundred years ago is still around and alive, being the family's biggest opponent in the industry. Barnabas has to struggle with that as much as with family internal problems and of course himself adapting to a new age. This brings along quite a few good laughs.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp sadly fails to reinvent himself as Barnabas Collins and displays the annoying habit to adapt gesture and humorous dialogues which made me think of Captain Jack Sparrow with make-up rather than an entirely new character. He's entertaining nevertheless, don't get me wrong. The rest of the cast is doing decently, from my point of view the only outstanding performance is delivered by Jackie Earle Haley, though. That guy is totally underrated. Sadly, sadly, sadly, the characters and their relations to each other are weak, superficial, the plot seems forced at times and character development is not to be found. The romance is as much of a joke as in the 18th century part of the movie. Again, I blame the script for this. Too many characters, too little screen time for each of them, too little time to evolve and make them appear alive.<br/><br/>All in all, a waste of potential, this one could have been big, instead it's mediocre. The only thing this movie shines at is the soundtrack. It's terrific. Wish I could say that about the rest of it."
"angelsungcinnamoroll","10","14","36","11 May 2012"," It's such an excellent movie with Johnny's amazing acting!
","When I saw the trailer of this movie, I immediately fell in love with this movie as I thought the storyline of the movie was extraordinary and seemed to be interesting! I was really looking forward to Dark Shadows at that time! Fortunately, this movie doesn't disappoint me.<br/><br/>Firstly, for the storyline of the movie, it is interesting that there is a great contrast between the lifestyles of the vampire Barnabas and the Collins. The whole cinema is fulfilled with laughters!<br/><br/>Although there are many scenes that make us, the audience laugh, there are still something I think can be better. For the plot of the movie, I believe that the director or the script-writer may want to focus on how Barnabas helps his family to restore their glory and ""defeat"" their enemy, Angelique. However, the plot of the movie is not that smooth since the movie has been talked about many points which are not that necessary like how the Collins holds a party. Therefore, I think the movie does not have a clear message which is to be brought out.<br/><br/>Apart from some unnecessary in the movie, I do think that the love between Barnabas and Victoria(Josette) is touching! 200 years ago, they were together and loved each other very much. Just because of Anglique, they were separated. 200 years later, Barnabas and Victoria which look similar as Josette fall in love again but Angelique comes across and makes Victoria jumps from the cliff! Luckily,Victoria doesn't die and be with her lover Barnabas this time! It 's just so touching that they can still be together if they love each other no matter how many 200 years are separating them!<br/><br/>Last but not least, I do appreciate how Johnny Depp acts out the character Barnabas Collins. He acts out the character naturally and can match with the tone of the movies. His acting skills is just so amazing. I am looking forward to seeing him to get an Oscar in the future and I believe that he will definitely win one very soon!I think Eva Green can also act out the witch Angelique. She makes me hate the character at the beginning but soon I think that her character is not that bad and she just wants the one she loves can love her. To conclude, Dark Shadows is a wonderful movie about vampire which makes people like me who don't really enjoy watching movie related to vampire to buy a ticket to support it. It's really a movie of a big family and a romantic story! I do love it!"

Going into the movie, everyone should expect some weirdness, that is Tim's style, which is why this dark vampire movie is perfect for him.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is in his zone as creepy, out-of-place Barnabas Collins. As always, he becomes the character and carries this movie nicely. <br/><br/>All in all, Burton/Depp fans will enjoy this movie.

"batmanjokercatwoman","10","9","21","13 May 2012"," The Vampire, The Witch and The Dysfunctional Family
","Horror-comedy involving various supernatural creatures, this is Tim Burton at his best. Burton does not set to direct perfect films he directs how he sees them, he and Johnny Depp really treated this film like their baby. Having not seen the original yet, so not knowing how faithful it is, this review is judging this as a stand-alone.<br/><br/>The cast and characters are all excellent; they all have their moment to shine. Johnny Depp is excellent as always, not his best performance however he clearly cares about the Barnabas Collins character. Eva Green is like an exaggerated version of Glenn Close from Fatal Attraction, perfect choice as the evil witch. Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as the family matriarch Elizabeth, this woman does not seem to age. Chloe Moretz is great as a moody teenager, clearly hiding a secret. Bella Heathcote is lovely as Victoria/Josette, so sweet and likable it is no question why Barnabas falls in love with her. Helena Bonham Carter is hilarious as an alcoholic doctor, Johnny Lee Miller is great as a selfish low-life, Jackie Earl Haley is well cast in a small but effective role as a scruffy caretaker.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's visual work amazingly as usual, every shot in the film is beautiful and artistic. The film is not as over colourful the advertising makes it out to be, just in certain parts, a lot of the colours are actually washed out, in a good way so you won't get a headache. The songs used in the trailers are present in the film, not in the same context, mainly during short montages and they are not overlong as many people are making them out to be. The Collins mansion is very well design, it almost a character itself in the film. The opening credits are very simple compared to Burton's usual opening credits, which is simply following Heathcote through her journey to the Collins with Nights in White Satin playing.<br/><br/>Any criticisms I can think are nit-picks; looking at it from a critical point-of-view the mixed reception is understandable. As a big fan of shows like Buffy and True Blood, and just like them you can nit-pick this film till you bleed but that is missing the point. It's not meant to be taken seriously, it's over-the-top, it's fun, it's got clichés and some decent metaphors involving family problems.<br/><br/>The climax was awesome and over-the-top action and CGI. It kind of reminded me of Jan De Bont's remake of The Haunting, I know it's a bad comparison because that film is horrible, however it works here because Jan De Bont expected his audience to take it seriously; Burton does not he knew his film was silly and took advantage of it. There are complaints of the climax involving a twist of Chloe Moretz's character, yeah it's very sudden but has a great metaphor behind it, especially when Pfeiffer finds out. The CGI effects are quite obvious, however it fits the tone so you won't care; it's still 10x better than The Haunting.<br/><br/>If I had to nit-pick I would say that because there is so many characters their moments felt kind of forced and rushed but I expected that, the story is very slight but this isn't meant to be Memento, and it does feel like it ends too suddenly but it's kind of bittersweet. And leaves it open for a sequel or let you decide what happens next.<br/><br/>This film is an escape not meant to be picked apart, just to be enjoyed with an extra large popcorn. After all films are made for entertainment, it doe not have to teach lessons, make sense or be analysed. Just play to your certain interests, that's where the film succeeds."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","12","31","9 May 2012"," Hell hath no fury like a witchy woman scorned...
","I'd never seen the original daytime Gothic soap that provides the source material for this film. So while those who *had* seen it were up in arms about how the trailers for this film didn't reflect the tone of the original TV series, I had no preconceived notions of how this movie ""should"" be. It looked intriguing enough, plus it had some very talented actors involved. I knew the basic premise of the film: Witch loves/is obsessed with man, man loves another, witch kills man's lover and curses man to be a vampire, buries him alive to suffer, 200+ years later vamp man is unearthed and finds himself in completely new era, then returns to his mansion which is now occupied by his dysfunctional distant relatives - this being the plot broken down to its most basic form.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp fashions another unique character portrayal for himself (if perhaps not as memorable/eccentric as his many previous ones). He plays Barnabas Collins mostly straight, allowing the character's fish out of water situation to provide the humour. He manages to make his character both human and monstrous at the same time (though it can be argued...how 'bad' is killing a bunch of hippies, *really*? At least he apologises beforehand). He also likes stroking furniture/stuff with his elongated fingers a lot. Depp's expressions/line deliveries are what elevate the character. He does the best with the material he's given. Playing opposite him as the scorned witchy lover from his past, Angelique, is the stunning Eva Green. She appears to be having a ball portraying 'Angie' (as she comes to be called later on when she's changed from a dark-haired servant girl to a successful business woman/CEO of Angel Bay and sporting new platinum blonde hair). Former Bond girl Green (who's had previous experience playing witches in The Golden Compass and Camelot) isn't afraid to go BIG with the role. She absolutely goes for it, and almost seems like she's in a film of her own, chewing scenery (with her wonderful red lips, which provide brilliant/scary grins on occasion) and not merely spitting, but rather projectile vomiting it out. The sex fight sequence between Angie and Barnabas - which takes place on the floor, the ceiling and every wall of a room, demolishing it completely - is pretty great (the post- coital cigarette/reveal of the destruction left in their wake got the biggest laugh at my theatre). Angelique - who wears the hell out of a sparkling red dress at one point - could have come across as very one dimensional, but in Eva Green's hands, by the end, she proves a tragic figure who *does* have a heart (despite all evidence to the contrary) and will literally rip it from her chest (still-beating) to give to the man she loves.<br/><br/>Reuniting with Burton, after her legendary performance as Catwoman in Batman Returns, is Michelle Pfeiffer as the matriarch of the Collins family, Elizabeth. Pfeiffer is very good in her role, as is Burton's partner and frequent collaborator, Helena Bonham Carter (playing psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman, and looking a bit like how the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland might have looked if she'd had a regular-sized head). Making a good first impression are Aussie actors Gulliver McGrath as David (the son of Elizabeth's brother, Roger - Johnny Lee Miller) and Bella Heathcote as Victoria Winters/Maggie Evans (who decides to take a job at the Collins Mansion as a governess, thanks to the ghost of Barnabas's original one true love, Josette - also played by Heathcote - who became Victoria's friend as a child that only she could see and consequently got her sent to a mental hospital). Heathcote is especially good, and should have a bright future ahead.<br/><br/>The movie's use of music (starting with The Moody Blues' 'Nights in White Satin') is one of the best things about the film. It fits perfectly throughout. The costuming is also really good. Danny Elfman's score is effective, as usual. On the downside is the underdevelopment of certain characters. Roger turns out to be just another lousy father to David, who's more interested in wealth than his son (as proved when threatened with an ultimatum by Barnabas). Jackie Earle Haley feels a bit wasted as Willie, who becomes a sort of 'Renfield' character to Barnabas - thanks to the vampire's magic hypnotising hand trick. Lastly, I don't get the obsession with Chloë Grace Moretz (who plays Elizabeth's daughter, Carolyn) that lots of people seem to have. Here she plays your typical angst-filled bitchy teen. It's ironic Carolyn asks Barnabas if he's stoned, when Moretz apparently thought the way to go with her character was to appear perpetually stoned herself, with no other facial expression but a permanent bitch-face. A WTF reveal about her character that comes out of nowhere near the end fails to make her any more interesting. If, however, you're interested in seeing a hairy Chloë Grace Moretz, then this film is most definitely for you.<br/><br/>The film looks great. It has the mood/atmosphere we've come to expect from Burton, mixing humour with gloom, and some surprising bits of violence. Hating on director Tim Burton and his regular collaborator Johnny Depp seems to be the 'in' thing nowadays for some people, but while this definitely isn't his best film, it's not as bad as others would have you believe either. Mostly, it just feels like a large mix of different things that don't always quite add up in the end. Of course there'll be those who choose to focus on the film's flaws, but I'm sure there'll also be others - like myself - who might find themselves enjoying the film for what it is."
"Elsie01","9","5","10","30 September 2012"," Brilliant, low rating makes no sense
","I can't believe this film got such mediocre reviews. I absolutely loved it. Maybe it was just badly marketed, ie if you're looking for a lightweight comedy then you'll be disappointed. I think maybe the reason is, it's a little too subtle for an American audience. Although (ironically) it was made by Americans, I think it has more UK/Australian audience appeal. I know that's generalizing (i.e. satire doesn't bypass all yanks), but generally speaking..<br/><br/>I thought it was really brilliant, very very clever & entertaining. Johnny Depp was (as usual) absolutely mesmerizing & the rest of the cast really hold their own. I really think this is Tim Burton in top form. <br/><br/>I think they could have done more with the soundtrack. It's not bad, but... it's set in the 70s, it should have had a killer soundtrack. Apart from that, I'm completely stumped by the low rating. It did get the thumbs up from the ABC's Aussie critics (Margaret & David) and currently has a high (4.5/5) score on the Oz iTunes store. So I think it's ""knowing satiric edge"" (per Margaret Pomeranz) was just, perhaps, a little too subtle for many.<br/><br/>I loved this film. I really hope they make a sequel."

","Really enjoyed this film. I am not name savvy enough to have known Tim Burton's film history (though I of course recognised the name) nor the series it was supposed to be a spoof of, so perhaps I benefited from not having expectations for this movie.<br/><br/>I love Chloe Moretz though she isn't central to the story, and Bella Heathcotte who plays 2 characters. Helena Carter is cool, though she'll always be the girlfriend from fight club for me. Johnny Depp had some straight comedy but most of the comedy elements were in the type-cast characters and situations which could easily be missed, more of a black comedy rather than for laughs. Yet it was mostly not all that dark for a black comedy, though some elements occasionally reminded me this was a 12A as some was some nightmare fuel.<br/><br/>I didn't come out thinking ""that was amazing I must tell everyone about the best film I've seen all year..."" admittedly, but I did slowly release the news of what I had seen and gathered people's opinions. By a day later I realised after choosing through film briefs and posters for which should be on my wall, that this was the only one that stood out.<br/><br/>That could be partly down to a lack of particularly inspiring films out at the moment, but this film's mix of iconic characters, cliché twists, satirical comedy and unobvious direction has made me quite fond of it suddenly.<br/><br/>If you have huge expectations it seems (by the ratings here) that you'll likely be disappointed. I went in knowing a few people who were in it and having the idea that it was a vampire comedy, but a weird one... And found it neither to be purely comedy nor purely weird, and wasn't disappointed. I feel sorry for people who saw a trailer that made it look like a pure comedy. That happened to me for Attack The Block and although the film was still OK, it does make you despise the people who market these things falsely."
"lostjedi","5","5","10","13 May 2012"," Why series aren't movies...
","This movie just does not work - although the actors all perform well. especially Johnny Depp. Tim Burton tried to cram a whole series into a movie - a task predestined to fail. I admit, I haven't seen the series, but as I saw the movie, my first thought was: This should have been a series.<br/><br/>A lot of very strange characters, all having a dark secret, all having a dark history, a great setting for some ""war"" between the witch and the vampire - and it is because of the length of the movie impossible to exploit them. Thus, the movie touches all of them slightly - way to slightly. The result is the constant feeling of passed chances to create something great, and putting it all to the waste - you're giving it all away in the end, all those about 10 plots are revealed ""using the sledge hammer"".<br/><br/>All in all, because of good acting and some funny scenes worth a watch, but I think I'll give the series a chance now - where all those great ideas mingled into a movie way seemingly feel more complete."
"idiot-snf","6","5","10","13 May 2012"," Felt like a collection of gags
","Note: I have not watched the original series.<br/><br/>The vampiric fish out of the water concept is fertile ground for jokes, as convincingly shown by the trailer. But Tim Burton overdid it. While there are a few funny scenes around there, a lot of it felt like the he went out of the way for certain scenes just because ""that would be funny"", and not enough attention was given to the central plot.<br/><br/>There are also so many subplots that were introduced but were left undeveloped or partially developed. I thought the character Vicky was severely underdeveloped. She looks like she had an intriguing past but the minute-long exposition didn't do justice to it. There are a whole slew of potentially interesting characters - Dr. Hoffman, David, and Elizabeth - that turned out to be incredibly one-dimensional. And the werewolf scene felt like an out-of-place ""oh, by the way"" moment.<br/><br/>The romance between Barnabas and Josette/Vicky is just banal. The love-hate relationship between Barnabas and Angelique was way more interesting, however their time together on screen was mostly devoted to ""sh*t and giggles"". The lines that Barnabas said to Angelique as she meets her doom was so cheesy it made me cringe.<br/><br/>All in all, it was entertaining alright. The set looks great, so does the costumes and make up. But the film was so focused on its campiness aspect that it ended up sorely lacking in depth and momentum. There just wasn't a consistent, proper build up from the beginning to the end, and felt like a compilation of gags intended to amuse/entertain, but not to engage."

","Tim Burton is one of the most successful and well-known film directors ever. Every work of his is completely dramatical, philosophical, satirical and all of them have an expressive Gothic atmosphere. So everyone waits that his next movie will be more impressive and memorable than previous one. And nobody waits for a fail.<br/><br/>""Dark shadows"" is a fail. There is nothing impressive and interesting in this film. It has not any well-written character or emotion. There is even not a Gothic atmosphere, while Johnny Depp goes all the classic vampire-man. Doings change each other and they are not connected every time. It seems like ""Dark shadows'"" screenplay was written by Burton on the roll of the toilet paper when he had a painful constipation. Then he looked on it and said: ""Of course, it's hackwork. But people will watch my films whatever I do"" - and made this ""movie"".<br/><br/>I would put this film 2 points, if there is not Johnny Depp (he is really good everywhere, and in ""Dark Shadows"" too), Helena Bonham Carter (she had a small role, but she played it really perfectly) and a little boy similar to Benedict Cumberbatch.<br/><br/>Burton's idea to create a film based on a classic TV-series failed. And I hope that it will be his only fail."
"s_campanale","6","6","13","11 May 2012"," Big Budget and technical excellence serve a lack of ambition- the original in reverse!
","Finally, after all the waiting, the movie is finally here. Now that we have it, what can we make it of it? The original was unintentionally funny in the way that many shows of its time (Star Trek-Dr Who-Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, etc.) were while maintaining an air of deadly earnestness, a combination that won it many fans. In a way it epitomised the ""Ed Wood"" syndrome that Burton and Depp so lovingly homage 17 years ago, a clash between grand intent and woeful lack of means/ability. The trailer made the film look like an all-out comedy, which it actually isn't. It attempts to take itself seriously most of the time, while throwing in some very broad and generic humour, and as many have pointed out the two here do not gel. There is no dramatic tension or irony created by the horror side by side with the comedy, no chiaroscuro contrasts, they simply sit side by side awkwardly, like a classical musician playing Mahler suddenly breaking out into rap then going back to Mahler! Perhaps if it had been done as an all-out absurdest comedy it might have worked better. Failing that, if it had been played deadly seriously, as the original was, there would have been the potential for plenty of real drama, pathos and power, the sort that Burton used to be able to find in movies like ""Batman"" ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". As it is the movie is not funny enough to be a comedy, it isn't dramatic enough to be an engaging emotional tale, and it isn't dark or frightening enough to count as genuine horror either. It tries to be all things and ends up being none of them. The film is admirable in its attempts to squeeze in as much of the original series as it can, even if most of it is of the strictly name check variety. However even these plot lines are changed for the worst. Take the origin story in the 1760s. In the original, Barnabas is a fool who professes love for Josette yet happily betrays her with Angelique, and is thus the main author of his own downfall. Here it's made to look as if Angelique does all the lusting, long before Josette ever turns up, thereby eliminating much of the tragedy and moral ambiguity in favour of a simple ""good vs Evil"" narrative. Also Barnabas' presentation to the modern Collins family, wonderfully creepy in the original, with its tones of ""Dracula"", the mysterious foreigner entering their midst, a man with centuries on his shoulders, the ""call of the blood"", the whole enigma of the portrait, here simply becomes Barnabas walking in to the home in 1760s regalia making no secret of who or what he is, making an instant pact with Elizabeth based on money for aid. It has no power, no mystery, no drama, and it does nothing but turn Barnabas into a one note comic character. The ""falling in love with the girl who looks like Josette"" storyline is played out well enough, with original narrator Victoria Winters actually being Maggie Evans before a name change, therefore combining both characters and their near identical story lines with Barnabas into one. The ghost of Josette, (the first ever supernatural element of the original series) here haunts not Collinwood but Victoria, and the film is never quite clear whether Maggie/Victoria is actually the reincarnation of Josette, or merely a ""sixth sense"" child whom the ghost latches onto in order to fulfil a destiny. Both possibilities are shown, and since Maggie and Victoria were neither, simply mistaken as such by Barnabas because of their looks, we are left to figure out for ourselves. Everything is wrapped up in an explosive finale which would be exciting and original if it wasn't almost identical to the ones in ""Witches of Eastwick"" ""Death Becomes Her"" "" Stardust"" ""The Wolfman"" and several others besides. Here Burton throws in a bag of other plot points, with the ""Collins curse Werewolf"" and the ghost of David's mother/Phoenix popping up out of nowhere to help deliver a sucker punch to baddie Angelique. You almost expect Quentin Collins, Reverend Trask or Count Petofi to burst out of the floor to take part, but I guess Burton is saving those for the sequel, along with Julia Hoffman, who alas here suffers the same truncated fate as her character did in the 1970 movie (in the series, after a rocky start she becomes Barnabas' right hand woman and greatest friend) but then it seems she too will return for the possible sequel. So the film itself is entertaining, featuring great actors and moody set design, but it suffers from the reverse of the ""Ed Wood"" syndrome of its famed inspiration. Here it is great means, ability and talent put to the service of an unambitious exercise in water treading. As a nights entertainment it is great, but with the names ""Dark Shadows"" and ""Tim Burton"" attached, it cannot help but leave you with a sense of disappointment and a longing for what could have been."
"cultfilmfan","10","7","16","14 May 2012"," Dark Shadows
","Dark Shadows is based on the television series of the same name by Dan Curtis. For those who have never seen, or heard of the Dark Shadows television series, it was a Gothic soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971. It was followed by the films House of Dark Shadows as well as Night of Dark Shadows and was remade into a television series again in 1991 and a television movie in 2005. Now we have this new theatrical movie version based on the television series which is directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp among it's quite impressive cast. Before seeing this 2012 movie version of Dark Shadows, I had never previously seen the different television shows, or movies that it was based on. I remember seeing the original series from the late 60's on in reruns on some specialty station on television, but I never saw more than a few minutes of it, so I walked into this new movie version not knowing too much about the plot, or back story from the previous films or television series. Also because I have never seen the originals I can not compare this new version to them either. From what I gather the original was done in more of a slow paced style and played out more melodramatically like soap operas usually do. This film version does do a bit of that, but I think unlike the series and movies, this version also incorporates humour into the story as well. This new version of Dark Shadows did not really get good reviews at all. I remember reading numerous bad reviews from critics and even average movie goers who were posting their blogs, or reviews of it online, and did not seem to like it. I fall into another category then because I absolutely loved the film. The fact that it was a Gothic horror costume drama that takes place in the early 1970's mixing the music, dress and culture of that era plus the more macabre events going on as well as some pretty humorous scenes as well, I found myself really enjoying it. For one thing, I really liked the atmosphere and look of the film. With it's great cinematography and visuals the film looked very good and quite appropriate to showing a castle from hundreds of years ago, plus the way they put in elements of the 1970's I felt worked very well and added more fascination and humour to the film as well. The performances from the entire cast were very good. After, I had thought about the film some more, I think I appreciated the performances even more because the actors had to be over the top and melodramatic when delivering their lines, but also do it in such a way as to be believable and realistic. It wasn't the type of melodramatic performances from say Hollywood movies of the 1940's, or 50's that I usually have a problem with. Often, I find that those performances from the older films do not hold up that well compared to today's movies and acting because they often feel dated and the performances lack emotion, or any shred of believability, or realism. It often felt very forced and over done whereas the acting in Dark Shadows does not and I would have to say that the performers do quite a good job and it is a very talented cast. The story to the film I found very compelling and fascinating. It required elements of the macabre and Gothic horror which I found to be fascinating and intriguing and I found that most of the humour that went along with it worked really well also. There were quite a few times when there was a certain line, or moment in the film that put a smile on my face mostly because of the good delivery and performances of the actors. The film managed to be dark and creepy, but never actually scaring, or disturbing us, or going over the top with violence, or gore. The film is fairly over the top in it's storytelling style, but it never took the easy way out by using expensive special effects and lots of gore. Instead it focuses on a well put together story that drew me in and captured my interest to the end. I was enjoying this film so much and found it so entertaining that afterwards I thought to myself about what critics did not like about it. Perhaps they just did not get it. I found everything worked together so well and was put on by a marvelously talented cast and crew that I never did find much faults, or criticisms about the film. Instead, I found it entertaining from start to finish and it really fascinated me with it's original and fascinating storytelling and it's unique delivering of how it went about telling us this story. I loved the acting, music, scenery and pretty much everything about the film. I know I am going to receive a lot of flack about this, but I would have to say that I loved Dark Shadows. Every minute of it and I am not ashamed to admit that. This film as it seems is certainly not for everyone, but I for one adored it because of it's sheer entertainment and fun."

I guess it takes a special kind of person to laugh at a ""comedy"" that features lots of bright red blood on the screen. And I guess I'm not one of them. <br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer is wasted too. And she seems like someone who should have known better. The total of enjoyable moments clocked in at under 10 for me.

"angelicseven","4","3","5","21 June 2013"," Dark Disappointment Lost in the Shadows
","This is one time I can't appreciate Tim Burton's work. When you remake a show.. you're suppose to hopefully elaborate better than the original, not stoop low by making it into something it wasn't.. a comedy, fantasy. Dark Shadows (1966- 1971) was a drama, fantasy, horror. Dark Shadows (2012) was no better than the degraded parody of The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) where everyone seem like outdated nerds. Ironically, this Barnabas was many years behind the times. This remake or version isn't a good tribute to Dan Curtis and must be surely a disappointment to long time faithful fans of Dark Shadows. It was bad enough I barely got a glimpse and recognized only David Selby who was Quentin Collins from the original TV show. Only to later learn Jonathan Frid was also in it which I never even saw as a Guest. Or any of the other original cast members.. if any were also in it. The other bad choice for this movie was all those 1970's songs that was played, that I couldn't wait til they stopped; purely an awful distraction, that took away from enjoying it. Even though it suppose to fit in the 1970's timeline that Barnabas awakened. Alice Cooper in it was no better compliment to it. Then there were those long boring dialogs between Barnabas and others which I could barely hear, let alone see any real purpose of what was being said. I started to recognize certain parts in it were cloned from other movies like Made in America (1993) where Tony Danson and Whoopi Goldberg were almost wrecking the home just getting carried away into getting romantically into each other. Only in this case it was Barnabas and Angelique doing it worse. The havoc Angelique did on Barnabas eventually began to seem like it was clone from Addams Family Values (1993) where the uncle's gold-digging new love Debbie Jellinsky was doing her worse on Festus in a similar destructive manner. It seem like the ending part where Barnabas hurries up to change Victoria into a vampire after she went to her death off a cliff, must of been something Tim Burton wanted to see happen. Through this it's like the movie is depicting where it looks like evil wins over good when it doesn't in theee end; this part I liked. I can understand Johnny Depp being so obsessed with the Barnabas character that he wanted to be him but this version isn't a winner. I would recommend to Dark Shadow fans to see the (1991) version of Ben Cross as Barnabas instead."
"oneiroi","2","3","5","6 April 2013"," Beyond painfulbeyond the pale
","Don't think this review will be a comparison to the original, because the Burton/Depp movie is so far removed and bears so little resemblance to the series that it can be critiqued as its own separate entity. Knowing who was involved, I admit to having low expectations going in, but was surprised to discover that it was far worse than I imagined.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a prologue and the problems begin immediately. The sequence is rushed and is aided by a Barnabas voice-over providing an expository information dump. This is a visual medium, show the audience, don't tell them. Who is he talking to and why? The audience, another character? Or is he dictating his life story to Will Loomis in parallel time? This sequence was the only one which provoked a laugh from me and an inappropriate one at that; when a bereaved Barnabas takes a dive off the cliff and splats on the rocks below. The effect was terrible and I laughed out loud. From that point on, I sat in stone-faced silence, nary a smile or chuckle to be had.<br/><br/>The movie then skips to the future and the seventies soundtrack, intended to evoke the era, comes across as intrusive and obvious, although my reaction may stem from a long-time loathing of Nights in White Satin. And the movie just continues careening downhill. Characters are introduced, but are really nothing more than hoary clichés. With the absence of any character development, we don't care for them, and why should we? When Barnabas reappears in the twentieth century, the characters' blasé attitude regarding his vampirism is illogical. Barnabas' attempt to adjust to a new era, especially in the montage sequence, is bad burlesque in need of the hook. The sex jokes about birthing hips, balls, fellatio, adolescent masturbation and panties on the face are puerile, obviously aimed at the 12 to 18 crowd, who mistake such things for wit.<br/><br/>The movie plods along at an excruciatingly slow pace, with the script attempting to insert too many characters and plot points from the series into a two hour time frame, a poor decision. At one point, less than halfway through, I found myself growing bored, restless, fidgety, and my mind wandering. Shortly after that, I struggled to keep my eyes open, as there was nothing to engage me. This movie is neither mysterious, dramatic, funny or frightening. Instead, it's dull, flat, slow, unfocused, turbid and directionless.<br/><br/>The performances overall are uninspired and forgettable. Jackie Earle Haley gets off one or two good lines that belong in another movie and Helena Bonham Carter was best in the brief scene where Dr. Hoffman attempts to psychoanalyze Barnabas. As for Depp, he does what one would expect in a Burton collaboration - slap on the white face and act strange. True to form, he ""borrows"" from other performers and/or performances, mostly Max Schreck from Nosferatu. It's the usual shtick and his performance is grandiloquent (that's not a compliment).<br/><br/>The climax of the movie is a pastiche from other films, including The Exorcist, House of Usher, the remake of The Haunting, Harry Potter flicks and, most notably, Death Becomes Her. Additionally, it throws in an out-of-nowhere, groan inducing ""twist"" and a hackneyed deus ex machina. Writer Seth Grahame-Smith should have his WGA card revoked and be banned from touching any and all writing instruments for life. Burton and Depp should simply divorce.<br/><br/>If this movie has you at all curious as to what Dark Shadows is really about, here's a suggestion. To see the Collins' business rival, Vicki's arrival and Roger's lousy parenting, rent Dark Shadows The Beginning, volumes 1-6. To see Barnabas' arrival, Maggie Evans, the Josette/Barnabas/Angelique triangle and how Barnabas became a vampire, rent the Dark Shadows Collection volumes 1-7. Yes, you'll invest a lot of time, but the acting is better (at times, great), the writing is more intelligent and crisp and there's some genuinely humorous snark delivered with panache. If Gothic drama isn't your thing and you're looking for a good vampire comedy instead, watch Love at First Bite."

But as it turned it wasn't funny and the story was crap. Now about the acting. I thought Johnny Depp wasn't bad considering it's a shitty role. And the girl I can't even talk about her she's like 15 and she's acting like she's in college. And Angelique I found her more disturbing. Tim Burton really blew it this time this is one of the most awful movies in 2012. It should be banned from the country. And the ending is the worst thing ever the walls were bleeding and Angelique kept on breaking like glass. And then Barnabas jumped from the cliff to turn Victoria into a vampire. And then the last scene was Dr. Julia under the sea and she's a vampire. I hope they won't film a sequel because I won't be able to stand it."
"jaguiar313","6","3","5","22 November 2012"," Uneven movie based on the classic TV show.
","Dark Shadows is yet another Burton/Depp collaboration that is based on the classic 60s-70s TV Gothic soap opera. And you'd think that being based on a whole TV series it would give the writers (John August and Seth Grahame-Smith) plenty of story to utilize, yet, this nearly two hour film has what barely could be considered a plot. Heir to the noble and wealthy Collins family, Barnabas (Johnny Depp) makes the mistake of messing with the wrong servant girl, Angelique (Eva Green) and when scorned, the witch causes the death of his true love (Bella Heathcote) and turns Barnabas into a vampire and has him sealed in a coffin for all eternity. But, Barnabas is set free, accidentally 200 years later in 1972 and finds the Collins Estate in a shambles and his old nemesis Angelique is the cause. Barnabas vows to restore his family empire to it's former glory while battling his powerful former lover. Along the way we do get elements from the show weaved in but, the film can never decide on a tone to it's thin story. One minute it is a fish out of water comedy and the next it's a horror film and next it's a drama. Is it spoofing the original show a la the Brady Bunch Movie, or is it a serious retelling like the brief run revival in 1991? The filmmakers don't seem to know. So what did work? The cast. I loved the cast. Depp is very good at portraying Barnabas and handles the character's script driven changes of tone very well. Michelle Pfeiffer is good, although not given much to do, as the family matriarch, Elizabeth. She plays her role straight and it works. Helena Bonham Carter is Julia Hoffman, the drunk family psychiatrist who tries to cure Barnabas of his curse. She plays her part as more comic relief but, smartly, never goes over the top. And as for over the top, Eva Green has a field day as the villainous witch, Angelique and has a great time with it and it translates to the screen as we have a good time watching her chew the scenery and sex it up. She makes this movie a lot more worth watching. The rest of the cast including, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller and Chloë Grace Moretz all have a good time with their roles and it's all these cast elements that bring Dark Shadows what fun it has. Burton's direction seems to be a bit laid back at times. As with his script, he doesn't seem to know what degree of seriousness in which to take his film and appears to change his mind depending on the scene. Although, it is when he has things played out with a sense of humor that Dark Shadows is it's liveliest as the more dramatic scenes are ho-hum and the climactic encounter between Barnabas and Angelique seems made up as it goes along. No better example as it is never clear whom is more powerful, Barnabas or the witch as it seems to change back and forth. And not to mention last minute reveals on characters that seem to serve the climactic struggle yet, could have been more fun to develop earlier in the narrative. All in all, Shadows didn't bore but, could have been so much more fun had a tone been decided on and the writers had taken better advantage of the 5 years of available story from the original show. Instead we get a mildly amusing passing of time saved mostly by a top notch cast who seem to know the director and scripters needed a little help."

"walking_short_15","8","3","5","5 September 2012"," Surprised, oh yes.
","It's has the vibe, in Tim Burton's view. I think sometimes combining the two, can be refreshing. We need more films that require original and creative imaginations of any genre. Even mixing two or three genres could be good justice. Tim Burton outdone himself on all his films and this one, did not disappoint me at all. Johnny Depp's character really was different than any films he has ever done, but very good sense of humor and has a Gothic view on how vampires should be. All of the casts and staff members who worked on this 150 million dollar movie, made some fans go. ""Eh, whatever,"" but most Burton's and Depp's fans likes it. Yes, it is strange, dark, and funny but remarkably incredible."
"AngeliqueBouchard22","9","3","5","28 June 2012"," Well...it was amazing!
","I am a massive fan of Tim Burton, but had never actually heard of Dark Shadows as a soap opera till the film was released (this is because it isn't really big in the UK); I was a little apprehensive at first, because he hasn't done a soap opera before and I didn't really know how he was going to play it, but I must say I was HUGELY impressed. Firstly, lets go with the golden trio, Depp, Bonham Carter, and Burton- now when a film comes out and these three are involved, I automatically get excited. Once again I was largely impressed by Depp's performance, as a vampire in a completely different era to his previous, the vocabulary used and comedic timing was spot on. However, though Helena Bonham Carter did do the film justice, I felt something somewhat lacking in her performance in comparison to her others, (Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland, Planet of the Apes.) She just didn't seem entirely focused, but it is not a criticism merely an observation. Moretz and Pfeiffer were absolutely fantastic as Mother and daughter, and with the final plot twist in the end you can really see the bond created between the cast members which was brilliant. BUT- the biggest congrats and praise goes out to the wonderful Eva Green, playing Barnabas' brief love interest, the jealous, psycho witch/bunny boiler, Eva's Angelique Bouchard was excellent, she stole every scene she was in with what seemed like effortless attempt, (even from Johnny Depp) and although psychotic and insane, played a deviant sexy strong character, or 'ballsy Barbie' . Her comedic timing was absolutely perfect and she was quite literally the star of the film. One cast member disappointed me though, and that was Bella Heathcote, I felt her portrayal as Maggie Evans/ Victoria Winters, was completely monotone, she was very plain and did not stand out for me at all, and I had to think that in the final scene, her likeness to one of Tim's animated characters was the only reason she got the role, as her acting was absolutely dismal. Overall, the film was extremely enjoyable, funny and in one particular scene, absolutely moving (I admit I did cry!)- The music was brilliant (who doesn't like the 70's) and it is full of laughs, and also a little scary at times. I went to see this at the cinema 11 times and I was NEVER disappointed, can't wait for the DVD!!!"

","I will be honest - off all the Tim Burton projects during the last decade this was the one I had little to no interest. I didn't seen the original soap opera and ""Burton is making a vampire movie"" didn't sounded like left-over idea. All reviews I hear where bad and I only went to see this out of principal ""Ok, I can't talk bad about this movie until I seen it""<br/><br/>And to be honest - At first It was a pleasant surprise! The first 40 minutes did a excellent job of introducing the world as well building up the dark atmosphere. There was so humor now and then but overall it was pretty good.<br/><br/>But then the movie got a bit flat and what I really hated was the love story! They spent like 20 minutes introducing Victoria character but after that there is little to no of here in the movie, and she has only like two scenes with Barnabas so it's hard to buy the whole romance between the two. The only thing that was making movie good was Eva Green character which was totally Psyco (and Deep as well) <br/><br/>But then the movie reach the climax and... It got cool again! The entire final fight was so dark and insane but campy at the same time it was hard not to enjoy it! <br/><br/>Overall one of weakest of Burton films but it has it moments. Some of the characters are fun (especially Eva Green) and I LOVE visuals during the final scene, to be honest worth of the ticket price."

","First of all I must say that I am a big fan of Dark Shadows the original television series, and I am a big fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp (separately and collaboratively. But I had my apprehensions when I saw the trailer for this movie. I was unsure of the direction of the movie, because of the serious tone of the television series.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. The movie starts fast and keeps you engaged throughout. Instead of necessarily focusing on one aspect of film-making it covers many. Suspense, Comedy, Horror, and Mystery are all a part of this film. Burton and the writers combine all of these elements while staying true to Burton's style and the television series.<br/><br/>The talented ensemble cast have great chemistry throughout the movie. Everyone has a purpose.<br/><br/>But I have to admit the standout is Johnny Depp. Talented might not be the word for him. He can absorb any type of role with ease. His character Barnabas gloats with honesty. His shyness of the new world he is facing, while being a vampire and having needs is a dilemma. Because of this Johnny's (seldom scene)comedic skills shine throughout. Barnabas is very blunt with his actions, but with his exquisite vocabulary and proper manners the comedy is non stop. I was literally laughing the entire movie. Some of my friends who knew nothing about the movie were laughing harder than I was.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie. The writing, directing, costume design,and acting are all top notch. One of the movies that make me still have hope in Hollywood. It's a must see. Don't hesitate. Another Burton classic."

","Dark shadows is a very unique movie it's classic Burton, this movie was so close to being a classic, all it needed was a few extra scenes here and there. I constantly here on other reviews people saying it can't decide whether it's a comedy or horror, well it's both in a way I mean it's not a scary film in any way but it's still creepy, and the humor is always put in the right spots of the movie and it's actually funny and it still doesn't feel like just a comedy. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great all the actors carry their rolls perfectly and they do not feel wasted at all, I can see how some saw this as the Johnny depp show as he gets most of the screen time, but the other characters do not feel under valued in anyway. <br/><br/>In conclusion this movie was a great installment to the Burton collection all though there is room for improvement it was a fun and extremely enjoyable movie. I recommend this to all people who are a fan of Burton's work."

","Tim Burton must have seemed the ideal choice to resurrect the most infamous television vampire Barnabas Collins and his relatives from the Gothic Dan Curtis black and white soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" that aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971. Burton loves to make movies about eccentric people, and the folks lurking at Collinwood exemplify the eccentricity gone wild. The problem with Burton's campy but reverential homage to ""Dark Shadows"" is that it is all wrong. Mind you, ""Dark Shadows"" is nowhere as egregious as either Barry Sonnenfeld's ""Wild Wild West"" or Todd Phillips's ""Starsky and Hutch."" The secret to ""Dark Shadows"" is that most of its fans took it seriously despite its outlandish subject matter. I remember getting home from school as fast as I could to catch part of the show. The black & white videography with its ""live telecast"" quality imbued the series with an eerie suspense. The siren-like music set to waves crashing convulsively against the rocks is something that I'll never forget. Remember, until Hammer introduced the Universal monsters in color, black and white was integral to horror. Now, whenever Hollywood has to fondly remember anything, it does so with a wink and a smirk. ""Dark Shadows"" deserved better. ""Dark Shadows"" deserves a straightforward adaptation. Kenneth Branagh might have been better suited and a two hour plus running time with all the seriousness of Kevin Costner's ""Dances with Wolves."" Instead, Burton skewers everybody and everything in sight. The only redeeming feature about ""Dark Shadows"" is the way Burton wraps everything up in 1970's nostalgia, particularly with its evocative source music, whether it is The Moody Blues' ""Nights in White Satin"" or a benign Carpenters' tune. If ""Dark Shadows"" had never existed, the Burton film might have been heralded as a work of genius. As it is, this handsomely produced homage looks as polished as anything Burton has ever done. Of course, if Burton had take the same approach that he did—playing things straight—with his ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot, ""Dark Shadows"" might have been fun. Often, I struggle to bring myself around to the filmmaker's perspective and give them the benefit of the doubt. Even with the benefit of the doubt, ""Dark Shadows"" is a misfire, but I suppose that it could have been infinitely worse."

","In all honesty, the first thing I noticed from this film was the Mcdonald's ads in the movie. This was fine I suppose, although some people may have found it tedious. My view on this movie was that, yes, maybe some of the actors were just put in here because they are friends of Tim, but furthermore they still acted to their best abilities and showed many profound qualities. Johnny Depp was probably the one having the most fun with his accent and seemed to enjoy himself. This movie had many qualities that we have not seen in other movies that Tim Burton directed. I noticed many comments which referenced to many sexual themes which was unusual to me in a film from Tim Burton (except for the one scene in Edward Scissorhands). I suppose it was to make the humor of today and make the movie more lovable. Then again it was humorous to me overall and made a tremendously great show for me. I loved to see the works that were shot in Los Angeles. (the wonderful quality of the cinematography, camera angles, etc) Special kudos to Bruno Delbonnel for his brilliant works with the cameras. I could Tell Timothy had many things on his mind flying back in forth from UK to help with Frankenweenie, then to California for the shoots and directing of Dark Shadows. He did a wonderful job on his film and had a great time in the works. The next coming films are sure to drive even more of an audience now that the table is set. I hope to one day be apart of something as great as this."

","I'd made a conscious decision to avoid previous Tim Burton films Alice in Wonderland, Sweeney Todd, Corpse Bride, and Charlie & the Chocolate Factory because, quite simply, I was fed up with the same actors playing the same dark, quirky, disturbed characters. Why did I give in and go see Dark Shadows? I'm asking myself the same question.<br/><br/>I rate Jonny Depp highly and love some of his movies, but this is clearly a pet project of his and an excuse to share his nostalgia for some old TV programme no-one's heard of (ok, so i'm speaking from a UK point of view). Stars cashing in on their fame and fortune to make something close to their heart is fine when the end product is worthwhile. That's not the case here.<br/><br/>The plot is a total mess with the minor characters flitting in and out of the story to facilitate the contrived journey of Barnabus (Jonny Depp). I found it annoying how some of the minor characters were used for the convenience of the plot without explaining the backgrounds to their stories. Bella Heathcote's character is set up in the beginning as the star-crossed lover who is seemingly a major part of the plot and then hardly used subsequently. Okay, okay, we know this is a Jonny Depp vehicle and no-one else matters, but is there any chance of it making some sense?<br/><br/>Incidentally, two of the four stars are for Eva Green."

The scenery was great and somehow they managed so make a dark foreboding mansion set in a bright sunny town... totally believable. In fact everything about the movie was believable.. and there are some pretty insane things in this movie.<br/><br/>But it just didn't click. Probably the script. Maybe the directing. Maybe the movie just couldn't decide what it wanted to be.. horror, comedy, romance, tragedy... Its like they were trying to make a superepic but just didn't have what it took.

","I saw this movie with my friend a few hours ago, and we had a blast. It was a hilarious good time. I watched a few of the original episodes to psych myself up and to understand the storyline, but I couldn't get into it. Soap operas aren't my thing. After seeing the movie, it makes me wanna try and watch them. I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a boring melodramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice. <br/><br/>In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Veronica Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to return the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him. If you want a smart Gothic fun hilarious vampire movie that pays tribute to the 70's era and the original series, I would definitely recommend DARK SHADOWS!!!"

","Barnabas (Johnny Depp) arrives in the new world in 1607 along with his parents, who establish a new colony call Collinsport. He had a girlfriend name Angelique (Eva Green), until he falls in love with another woman name Josette (Bella Heathcote). This breaks Angelique heart and curse Barnabas, which turns him into a vampire, and his future family will be curse as well. The towns' people turned against him and placed him in a coffin, burying him alive. 196 years later, he is awakened and notices that the town he once lived has change. His goal is to rebuild his family name and to rebuild his family fishing company that once dominated Collinsport. His competitor is none other than Angelique. <br/><br/>Dark Shadows is Tim Burton and Johnny Depp eighth collaboration. Two years ago Tim Burton disappointed me with the release of Alice in Wonderland and I gave it a D- when I reviewed it. Did Tim Burton redeem himself with his latest film? The answer to that is sort of.<br/><br/>The plot of Dark Shadows is simple and believe it or not somewhat interesting. At the same time though it bored the heck out of me. The weakness is that it the film is very predictable. Basically you gonna know what's going to happen from the beginning to the end. The last act felt rush becausewell I really can't say otherwise I'll spoil the movie. <br/><br/>The film delivers great casting. Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloë Grace Moretz, and Jackie Earl Harley are talented in this movie. I do have problems with Johnny Depp performance. Don't give me wrong he is a good actor, but ever since playing Capitan Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean Series, he brings that character in other films most of the time, for instant his personality is identical. In other words he's like the Capitan Jack Sparrow of vampire. Another issue was that despite great casting, some, if not, the majority of the supporting characters have little screen time. For example, Chloë Grace Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard was an interesting character, but she only get 10 minutes of screen time. What's up with that? <br/><br/>Dark Shadows has good humor. I admit, I laugh couple of times, but it wasn't enough at the same time. Then again I'm probably trying to see for I wanted to see as oppose for what it is. For what it is, it was so- so.<br/><br/>What Tim Burton is good and will always be good is his unusual visionary. For instant, His ""gothic"" setting looks great. His long music composer and collaborator Danny Elfman knows how to compose his films and does it for its best. <br/><br/>Dark Shadows has it moments. Is it worth seeing it in theaters? No. Personally I would wait and rent this movie. Dark Shadows is not a bad film, but it could have been better."
"wareaglegurl","5","4","8","14 May 2012"," Started out good, all downhill from there...
","I was really excited to see this movie after seeing the trailer on TV all the time. I love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's done some good stuff, so I figured it would be a pretty decent movie. However, the trailers completely give you the wrong image, making it out to be a funny ""fish out of water"" comedy, when the movie itself it pretty dark and intense. I figured from the trailer it was PG-13 most likely because of language, but it was pretty violent and a bit sexual, not something you want your 6 year old seeing. Another thing, (I hate it when they do this!) ALL THE FUNNY LINES ARE IN THE TRAILER! So if you've seen the trailer, I kid you not, you've seen the entire comedic aspect of the movie. <br/><br/>They could have totally gone in another direction by making this strictly a comedy with not nearly as dramatic and intense a plot. I would have enjoyed it much better if it focused on the funny things Barnabas does while trying to assimilate into society, like the Disney movie ""Enchanted"" or ""Back to the Future."" There is one scene where Barnabas sees a McDonald's sign and thinks it's the Devil and another where he rips open the family TV thinking there is a ""tiny songstress"" inside! Why wasn't there more of that in the movie and why wasn't that the main focus? Instead, the story focuses on a corporate battle and the rivalry between Barnabas and the witch Angelique. Honestly, the rest of the characters are just pointless and do nothing. I get that Tim Burton was trying to stay true to the old TV show, but by doing that, he ends up cramming in a bunch of little subplots that are really pointless and lead no where. He could have appealed to a much larger audience and most likely been more successful if he had stuck with the comedy and even possibly made the film PG. To sum it all up, MORE COMEDY, LESS WEIRD DRAMA."
"Evil_and_Divine","5","4","8","13 May 2012"," Mediocre at best, the only real highlight was the Alice Cooper cameo.
","I remember when Tim Burton used to be a respected filmmaker. Specially women seem to always be Crazy for his work. And I do agree that he has a unique style and he has made many good movies like: Beatlejuice, Batman, Nightmare before Christmas etc...<br/><br/>But when he made Alice in Wonderland things had changed. Everything was a mess and I just ended up not caring about any of the characters. This movie is exactly the same, first half was alright. At first when I met all the characters I thought that it could be really interesting. Sadly i was wrong.<br/><br/>Even with Johnny Depp in the main role and a lot of other good supporting actors things just fall flat. Pointless side stories, a boring love story and some really cheesy dialog. Like when Carolyn jumps down as a Werewolf and say something like ""yeah I'm a Werewolf, big deal"". At that moment I cringed in my seat and felt embarrassed that i was watching this. I also don't really understand who this movie is made for. Tim Burton is normally really popular among the women. But in many ways he made it more to please the men. I mean a large part of the movie seems to be about Women being eye candy for the camera. Even the 15 year old Carolyn poses as if she has somehow mixed up acting with modeling.<br/><br/>But lets name a few positive things: Well it's a Tim Burton movie so it has a kinda cool gothic/70s feel to it. Depp is alright and pull off some funny jokes. It has some good 70s music. The main reason I'm giving this movie a 5 is because of one person. Alice Cooper...The moment he started preforming i was having a blast. Sadly thats not enough to salvage rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Lets just hope Tim Burton has learned something from his latest mistakes."

","Dark Shadows, the new collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, a remake of the late 60's television show of the same name, is a disappointing train wreck of flat characters, weak storytelling, and is guilty of a mundane premise. This is just another movie (a la Alice in Wonderland) where the names Tim Burton and Johnny Depp don't go synonymous with greatness.<br/><br/>Barnabas Collins (Depp) is a vampire, imprisoned for 200 years in a coffin by his arch nemesis and lover-to-the-end-of-time Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), and wakes up in 1972, only to find that he is in a different place, different time, and that his family fortune is all but none. He heads back to his home in Collinsport and seizes the opportunity to help his living heirs and hopefully destroy Angelique once and for all.<br/><br/>One of the problems this movie has, albeit a lot, is that nothing ever seems too big of a deal. The 1972 Collins family is struggling to survive; yet no one works. They all blame the lack of their once successfulfishing company on Angelique's slow turning monopoly ""Angel Bay Seafood"". I know there's a point where you have to suspend disbelief but come on, battling seafood companies? The Collins' are a collection of great actors but horrible characters. Michelle Pfeiffer, the so-called matriarch, is nothing more than a brooding house mom with too much time on her hands. I personally kept getting distracted by her ridiculous eyelashes. Jonny Lee Miller, as the dim-witted selfish brother offers nothing exciting during his screen time and when he leaves us it is with relief rather than regret because it wasn't like he was doing much when he was on screen anyway. Chloe Moretz, one of the few child actors nowadays that I am actually excited to see grow up into a fine actress, is wasted as a brooding teenager, having no new insightful moments or any act relative to the story at hand. Her turn in the third act is unjustified and is over as soon as it starts. Helena Bonham Carter. Well. This movie really made me miss the Bonham Carter that was in Fight Club because since she got hitched to Burton, she seems to be playing loud obnoxious characters that aren't funny and waste time on screen (think the Red Queen and now this atrocity).<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality Dark Shadows has is that its soundtrack is pretty awesome, giving us some 70s tunes that we haven't heard in a while and making good use of the time period with production design. It also reminds people like me that when something is being marketed as the new Tim Burton-Johnny Depp movie, I know now not to get as excited as I used to.<br/><br/>Chad FilmPulse.net"
"EmmaDinkins","5","4","8","12 May 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Some time spent with a vamp.
","When I originally saw the trailer for Dark Shadows, my first thought was why would Tim Burton remake this classic supernatural television series drama about a tormented vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) into a comedy? My second thought was this is going to suck, no pun intended. Turns out it wasn't really a comedy as much as it was a comedic take on the Barnabas situation. It was actually fairly masterfully done keeping the tone of the film balanced between comedy and creepy, although the funniest comedic dialogue was in the trailer. I was pretty young when the series aired on television, but I did recognize the names of most of the characters and their demeanors, so the film did stay pretty much true to the Elizabeth Collins (Michele Pfeiffer) persona of a cold and calculating woman putting her own interests first. I don't recall much about her daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), but I was more fascinated by Ms. Moretz than her role. Did I miss the time warp memo? First of all wasn't she like ten in Hugo and wasn't that just last year and now she's fifteen. Speaking of a time warp, how is it that Alice Cooper looked just as old in 1972 as he does today? And for comedy sake the Alice Cooper being a woman joke is just old, as is the balls joke, and now I just feel like I'm ranting. So here's the thing, I wanted to see a wildly original film that would be fun and memorable, and it just didn't turn out that way. There were the obvious Beetlejuice moments, and there were moments that the story was so stalled that I almost dozed off. I will say though that the recreation of 1972 was pretty cool, as an eleven year old I found the psychedelic age fascinating and hearing the Curtis Mayfield Superfly soundtrack as a backdrop to that film with the name prominently displayed on the small town movie marquee totally took me back. Unfortunately, that same type of fond memory was not the end result from viewing Dark Shadows, even with Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer leading the cast, it just fell short. Angelique (Eva Green) was supposed to be a super villain and I found nothing about her or her vendetta to be at all interesting, the most interesting character was Willie (Jackie Earle Haley), whose apathy was probably what I could relate to most, with that I give this film an amber light, only because of my Superfly moment."

","Despite the very disappointing and unpromising trailers that tried to make this movie look like a spoof or satire, Tim Burton has actually created a very worthy tribute to the late 60s TV cult classic. The characters names remain the same and some even resemble the originals (ex. Roger Collins). Even names of minor locations (Windcliff Santorium, Blue Whale pub, Widow's Hill) remain the same. Of course, some composite characters and unique plot lines are used trying to cram 1500 plus episodes into 2 hours. As a fan of the TV series and Tim Burton, I am pleased with the outcome. The soundtrack is amazing with great songs from the era. Alice Cooper is a very good choice for the Collin's ""happening"" as he is the Godfather of Goth. So, if you are a fan of ""Dark Shadows"", don't be dissuaded by the trailers and go and see this dark gem."

","If you're a fan of Dark Shadows, you can't go into it with the expectation that it will be like the original/s because it's not. It's the same story line and the same characters, but it takes it all and throws some comedy into it. You just need to take it for what it is, a supernatural dramady... While I never watched the original Dark Shadows, I did watch the mini series they came out with in 1991 and it took me over completely. I was in love with the story, the characters, and the darkness that it brought once a week on Friday Nights! It was an impact on me to say the least. I watched it all over again thanks to NetFlix and was in love just as much as I was back in 5th grade when I saw it the first time! But comparing that to this movie is like Apples to... Pears.... They are very similar but not the same... But I didn't find that to necessarily be a bad thing. And really, I'm a fan of Tim Burton. I love the style he brings to movies and his touches were everywhere. Something I really enjoyed was how it was dark and dreary, and yet there were such bright and colorful scenes or objects thrown into it. I found that contrast to be wonderful! It just added that much more to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I really liked Michelle Pfieffer in it. I thought that she played her character well. She kinda had that powerful beautiful b&^%h thing going on much like she did when she was Cat Woman. I enjoyed that very much. (And she looked awesome!) The rest of the cast was fun. The children were played well. Helena Bonham Carter was fun as always. (Loved the bright orange hair!) Eva Green who played Angelique did a fantastic job. She could go from beautiful to crazy rather quickly and the looks she could give with those big eyes of hers were nothing short of freaky! And of course Johnny Depp rocked his part as always. He was a fun Barnabas and I enjoyed his take on the character.<br/><br/>Over all I liked it. It was what it was and I was entertained! My only issue was at the very end where they just throw something in out of the blue... I will never understand how anyone can think that such a thing works in a movie... But other than that, it was fun, it was entertaining, it made me laugh, and it did manage to bring me back to Collinwood, a beautiful, powerful, place full of Ghost Stories and the supernatural.

","'DARK SHADOWS': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team together once again to bring the popular 1960's horror soap opera (of the same name) to the big screen in campy spoof form. Fans of the original series will most likely not be pleased by Burton's rendition of the melodramatic soap as it lacks strong character development as well as story structure and never takes the material seriously in the slightest. The film was written by Seth Grahame-Smith and John August (both future and past Burton collaborators on other films as well) and co-stars the likes of Eva Green, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Jackie Earl Haley, Johnny Lee Miller, Bella Heathcote and of course Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's mainstay and partner). The film will most likely let down Burton and Depp fans as well, although Depp is good in the film like always.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Barnabas Collins (Depp), a rich playboy in 1752 who breaks the heart of a servant named Angelique Bouchard (Green), who also happens to be a witch. Out of anger and jealousy Angelique curses Barnabas to be a vampire and causes his one true love to commit suicide. She then convinces the townspeople to turn against him and bury him alive. Barnabas is trapped, chained in a coffin, for centuries until he is freed by some construction workers in 1972. He then returns to his estate to find it in ruins and under the hands of his depressed distant relatives, lead by Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer). Barnabas must then do battle with Angelique once again in order to save his new family.<br/><br/>The film is darker than I was expecting! Depp's Barnabas is not a good vampire like the trailers lead you to believe; he murders and feeds on innocent victims and yet he is the film's hero. Depp is hilarious in the role and the 'fish out of water' humor does work for the most part but the rest of the story does not. It has no direction and seems to just consist of a bunch of random scenes thrown together. Burton's directing is not efficient and I actually found the film quite boring at times. Still Green looks gorgeous, it's nice to see Pfeiffer working again and the rest of the cast is adequate. The film just had potential to be a lot more and for fans of Burton it can't be labeled anything but a disappointment.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01kYho5uKO8"
"Boba_Fett1138","5","5","11","14 May 2012"," Could had been amusing but it remains too underdeveloped for that.
","There really once was a time that Tim Burton just could do no wrong by me. I loved his unique style and visions but his more recent movies have been nothing but disappointing. His style feels more like a gimmick now days and he doesn't seem to be interested in telling a good story, with intriguing enough characters in it.<br/><br/>And this movie ultimately is also a very shallow one. It does a poor job at handling its characters. Most never get developed properly enough, so you don't feel any involvement with any of them and it makes the movie vague and confusing about the motivations of the different characters.<br/><br/>Seemed like the movie had plenty of ideas in it. Too many perhaps. It occasionally picks up a plot line but then completely drops it for another one. It makes this movie feel like a underdeveloped one, that never sets up anything properly. Instead it makes the movie feel like it's being all over the place with its story. When you think that the movie will be heading into a certain direction with its story, it suddenly takes a completely different approach and abandons all of its initial ideas. Seemed at first that the movie would be about Barnabas Collins trying to reclaim his family position. It then seemed like it was going to be a love-story and finally the movie suddenly started to involve a villainous plot, that worked out as something far too forced. No, it really isn't a very natural feeling or flowing movie, which also truly prevents it from ever becoming anything fun because it's also so terribly uninvolved and shallow to watch all. This especially goes for the movie its final 30 minutes or so, which just was one big mess, in my opinion. I literally had no idea what was going on anymore, simply because I had also lost all interest at that point and stopped trying to like and understand the movie.<br/><br/>The movie does has its stronger points though. It remains a great looking movie, with all of its sets, costumes and makeup and I also liked the collaboration between director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman, which was something that seemed to be lacking the last couple of years but it seems like they have really found each other again with this movie, which is also one that feels a bit more into tone with Burton's earliest work, such as for instance ""Beetlejuice"". <br/><br/>I also really liked Johnny Depp, even though his character remained terribly shallow and not very interesting throughout the entire movie. He still manages to put a lot into his role and still give some life and fun to this movie. I also really liked Eva Green as the evil villain but everything else in this movie was interchangeable really. Most characters don't even seem to have a real purpose for the movie at all and actors such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller and ChloÃ« Grace Moretz all remain terribly underused. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie remains pretty amusing, I give the movie that but I just can't forgive it for its second half and other weaknesses. It makes this far from a great or recommendable movie.<br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"drqshadow-reviews","5","2","3","14 January 2013"," Despite a Recklessly Overstuffed Plot, Burton's Latest is a Thin, Watery Affair
","Although I was sucked in by the sheer, merry lunacy of this world, its characters and their wardrobe, there's really no excusing some of the faultlines that run through the heart of this confused little horror saga. It suffers from a severe case of subplot-itis, and tries in vain to cram four chapters' worth of back story into nearly every face. Even the less interesting minor players are obsessively over-inspected, which leads the more important characters to pull constant disappearing acts. Pseudo-protagonist Belle Heathcote is the most glaring example, vanishing without explanation for a full forty minutes during the second act, and then materializing right in the middle of a cramped romance. Johnny Depp's Barnabus is the one constant, happily sailing far over the top in yet another colorful, inexplicably successful leading turn. I caught myself laughing at the punchlines more often than I'd expected, but Dark Shadows often tests the boundaries of good taste, and in one case (an out-of-left-field comic love scene) ventures too close to the uncomfortably absurd. Kooky and silly, it's unforgivably (and thoroughly) lacking in the kind of panache Tim Burton was always known for."
"ARTaylor","5","2","3","30 November 2012"," Poor Effort from Burton
","I don't know what to make of this movie. I really don't. It tries to do so many things and ends up doing nothing. The plot is all over the place. There's a lot going on so it's hard to find the important details.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Tim Burton as long as I can remember. I grew up watching his two Batman films, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands. I've followed his work from Pee-wee's Big Adventure through Big Fish. His recent efforts (Planet of the Apes, Alice in Wonderland) have noticeably lacked his earlier charm. I've only been disappointed with two of his movies: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which was more due to how good the original is) and now Dark Shadows.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a Gothic soap opera from the 60s and 70s. Johnny Depp plays a vampire who awakes to find his dysfunctional descendants plagued by the witch who made him. I have very vague memories of the show, mostly when I caught the last five minutes while waiting for The Incredible Hulk on Sci-Fi Channel. I know little about the series, and it seems the movie is made for fans of the show with little effort to create new ones. Besides Barnabas and Angelique, there's little development in the other characters. They all have the occasional scene but nothing memorable. These seem mostly to reference some event in the show and not really help the movie in any significant way. Worse yet, Angelique makes a horrible villain. She has no reason to act other than she loves a man who doesn't love her. The whole time I kept waiting for some dynamic motivation that never appeared.<br/><br/>The movie is trying to be a comedy, Gothic horror, and romantic drama but never really succeeding at any. The problem is, anytime the movie starts getting into one particular genre it changes gears. The separate elements never really blend together. I understand that the show has a certain camp factor to it, but I've read that this was mostly unintentional. Perhaps if they had simply made it a comedic Hammer films style film, or romantic comedy, or Gothic romance. But the three together never work as a cohesive whole.<br/><br/>The finale (not really spoiling anything here) is representative of all the problems of the movie. By the time the third act came out I had somewhat zoned out. I knew what was going on, but simply didn't care. It felt like the movie was just going through a series of checkpoints but without any feeling. There are revelations that mostly come out of nowhere, but apparently are based on the show. The whole thing screams of committee filmmaking, like the studio put too many demands on the film without letting Burton be Burton. Either that, or since Depp and Burton were such fans of the show they tried to hit too many major story points and forgetting to make it into a single film. It's okay to cut stuff out for a sequel. The first Terminator and Indiana Jones films cut out material that they ended up putting into the second. It's okay to not include every single idea.<br/><br/>Had the movie stuck with the fish out of water story, this would have been great. The best scenes are Barnabas encountering ""modern"" life like roads, television, and pot-smoking hippies. Depp makes these moments quite hilarious. I found the line confusing McDonalds with Satan to be very effective.<br/><br/>The only really good thing about the movie is that Burton certainly has his unique look. He is definitely one of the most visually distinct directors out there, if not the most. Every frame of the movie has his visual stamp on it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I can't really recommend this to anyone. It's not even an okay-at-best effort from Burton like Alice in Wonderland was. The movie won't win over any new fans for the show. And fans of the show will probably find this to be little more than a overly-silly CliffNotes version. It's too dark to be a comedy and too silly to be a drama. The series is fondly remembered. The movie won't be."
"GoodfellaSeinfeld","4","2","3","20 November 2012"," Dull, Vapid, and the least Burton of Burton's movies.
","Burton and Depp have been powers together for years. Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands have to be two of of Depp's best performances. In Alice in Wonderland Depp was honestly one of the only things I really enjoy about that movie. I bring this up because the number one problem with Dark Shadows IS Depp. This movie has a very weak story, terrible acting, and AWFUL characters. Dark Shadows is the worst Burton movie ever and is definitely one of the worst movies of 2012. The story is a clichÃ©. Barnabas Collins, an imprisoned vampire, is set free and returns to his home, where his descendants are in need of his protection from the same witch that cursed Barnabas. This movie is based off the T.V. show of the same name. If you name a T.V. show that had a movie come out in the last decade, they all have had this story line of characters from old times trying to interact with the current world (Smurfs, Yogi Bear, Scooby Doo, etc.). It is depressing that a horror-comedy made for ADULTS has the same story as the Smurfs. The good things in this movie are minimal. I liked the music as I am an Alice Cooper fan. As always I enjoyed ChloÃ« Grace Moretz. I think she is the best child actress for the past couple years (Hugo, Kick-Ass, etc) and she alone gives the movie some extra spirit. Michelle Pfeiffer was OK as well. Another thing I would like to point out is the grounds keeper has the only funny lines throughout the whole movie. The movie has TONS of problems. The movie is very unsure what it exactly it wants to be. The tone will take a 180 at random points and the plot defiantly suffers. An example is one scene where Barnabas Collins is sitting, talking to a bunch or hippies smoking pot. They are all having a great time and Barnabas even smokes a joint. Immediately after Barnabas say he has to kill them and does. An audience cannot get behind a movie that has no clue what it wants to be. The villain is also very terrible and many scenes and characters go no where. The number one problem that ruins the entire movie is Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins. He gets my award for worst actor of the year and I honestly think he made this movie go from a 5 to a 4. I honestly find him to be intolerable and I really think Depp phoned in this performance. Overall, I really do not like this movie. The story is lame, the acting is terrible (for the most part), and the tone is all over the place. Dark Shadows is a very lazy and unfunny movie that so far is at number 5 for the worst movie of 2012."
"willworkman","2","2","3","16 August 2012"," Biggest disappointment of the year
","I had such high hopes for this movie.<br/><br/>The clashing of black-clad Victorian prudishness with garish swinging 70s has amazing comic potential, especially with the irony that the prude kills people. Imagine a bicycle outing along the beach, with Barnabas on a velocipede. Imagine the family surprising him by fixing up his coffin with a water-bed and fiber optic lamp. It could have been so good.<br/><br/>So what the hell happened? Lots of people have pointed out that the movie was a mishmash-- didn't know whether it was satire, slapstick, drama or what. True, but the bigger problem is the dull, dull pacing -- the actors just trudge from one plot point to the next, passing up every opportunity for originality along the way. <br/><br/>None of the characters have any back story, they look like Burton picked them out of a catalog. That's especially noticeable in the villain, whose motivations are completely one- track and ridiculous. You can't have a character on screen for 20 minutes without developing her somehow. Snidely Whiplash is a more believable villain. In fact, not one of the characters was remotely likable.<br/><br/>I like Tim Burton and even defended Planet of the Apes (garbled ending and all), but he should have turned this concept over to Wes Anderson."

So, I was looking forward to Dark Shadows. At the beginning it start's off really well, but by the end of the film I left the theater disappointed. It's Tim Burton film so you know Johnny Depp is in it, and he is a entertaining lead as usual. Eva Green was over the top, but also entertaining. Like all of Burton's films it's very pretty to look at. Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Jackie Earle Haley & Chole Moretz feel very under used. The chick that played Barnabas's love interest, Bella Heathcote is a bit bland actress. The main reason why this is such a disappointed is because once the film hit's the party scene it got way to confusing and the rest was downhill from there.

"estebangonzalez10","6","2","3","25 June 2012"," Burton and Depp this is getting too repetitive
","Â¨It is said that blood is thicker than water. It is what joins us, binds us... curses us. My name is Barnabas Collins, and this is my tale.Â¨<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is the latest collaboration between director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp; it happens to be their eighth time working together. The bond between them just might be thicker than blood. Their friendship began when they worked together in Edward Scissorhands more than 20 years ago and it has developed from there on as they've collaborated with each other repeatedly, making some great films together and others not so much. Dark Shadows will be one of those films that fall in the not so great category and may perhaps be a sign that their collaboration together is getting old and repetitive. We all know how great of an actor Johnny Depp is and he's always enjoyed to play these kind of eccentric characters. That is why Tim Burton seemed to be a perfect fit for him as a director because he's such a great art director who is able to paint an eccentric vision of the world. Actually that is the only element that worked in Alice in Wonderland, and is what saves Dark Shadow from being rotten: the fantastic art direction. Burton takes us back to the 70's with some wonderful visuals and recreates a small fishing town to perfection. Johnny Depp also gets to play a very eccentric character once again as he's a vampire who's just awoke from the 18th century, so it plays out as the classic fish out of the water tale. But just like in almost every Burton film, you can't fit his movie into one specific genre as it mixes dark comedy with horror, fantasy and some romance. Dark Shadows at times fits in all of these categories and at others it's just hard to figure out what Burton was trying to do. <br/><br/>During the 18th century the Collins family leaves England and arrives in America with the prospect of building a fishing empire. They do so and end up having the town named after them: Collinsport. They build an enormous mansion and have several servants working for them, but they fall under an evil curse when their son Barnabas (Johnny Depp) breaks the heart of a witch named Angelique (Eva Green). He tells her that he doesn't love her and ends up falling in love with the beautiful Josette (Bella Heathcote). Angelique curses the family by killing Barnabas's parents, Josette, and turning Barnabas into a vampire and burying him alive inside a coffin. The story then jumps to the year 1972 where we are introduced to the surviving members of the Collins family residing in the very same mansion which is now in evident decay: Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), Elizabeth's widowed brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his tormented son David (Gulliver McGrath), and their staff which consists of David's psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), and Mrs. Johnson (Ray Shirley). Barnabas is released from his coffin by accident when some construction workers find the coffin and open it. He returns to the mansion which is now in ruins and after convincing Elizabeth of his true identity promises that he will restore the family to its former glory. What he doesn't know is that the town is run by Angelique now he is still very much alive and hasn't aged one bit.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie worked for me as a very dark comedy. I actually enjoyed the film, until the final act which just went a little too far in its bizarre act and eccentricities (even for Tim Burton standards). The final act was a disappointment, but I did enjoy most parts of the story. Johnny Depp played his usual strange self and Michelle Pfeiffer was great in her role. She claimed to be a fan of the original soap opera that took place during the late 60's and 70's which this film is actually based on. Despite the television show not being a comedy, this film actually plays out as one in the same way most 70'sand 80's TV series are being turned into in recent years. I am a big fan of Chloe Grace Moretz and have followed her since her work in 500 Days of Summer, Kick Ass, and Let Me In. I wish she had been given more screen time because she is always a delight to watch on screen and had an interesting character. Dark Shadows is a very weird movie and definitely not for everyone; it won't be ranked among Burton's best work either (not even close) so I don't know if fans will actually enjoy this film, but I did have enough of a good time during most of the film to give this film a passing grade. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"robp-919-675582","6","2","3","26 May 2012"," Tim Burton at his good but not the best
","Definitely worth watching even though it's not a masterpiece due to several factors. First of all, the absurd gets too absurd to the point it becomes funny. I know some will say that it might have been the director's intention, but sorry, for me it didn't always work. E.g. the vampire brushes his teeth while he can't even hold the toothbrush right because his fingers are awkward and gum-like. On the other hand, all the viewers who say it was total crap are in my opinion totally wrong. They say the film dragged on for ever, and there was no action in it. Well, it's not a Bruce Willis type of movie my dear! If you watch Burton's production you have to savor what you see, the plot itself is of secondary importance here. One great asset of this title is the cast, though it is not always brilliant. I was totally taken aback with Eva Green's portrayal of the demonic witch. She was a perfect choice for this character. Her stunning beauty, her mesmerizing eyes and, of course, the mind-blowing red lipstick was a perfect lure to seduce you into letting her do whatever bad thing she wanted to do to Mr. Collins (J.Depp). Speaking of which, Johnny Depp was great but I kind of got fed up of watching him AGAIN no matter how good an actor he is. Sometimes it is a nice thing to have somebody fresh, and I have the impression he is out of ideas for another character like this. I liked to see Michelle Pfeiffer, because she was beautiful, other than that nothing to write home about. The funny moment was to see Alice Cooper play himself and look exactly the same in 1972. The young actors, especially Bella Heathcote was a pleasure to watch. To sum up, if you know what Tim Burton is like you will enjoy it despite its obvious shortcomings."

It did however have some problems, for example in some scenes you felt just lost in weirdness, Johnny Depp plays a quirky, weird vampire who is turned into this creature because of an evil curse on him, he does play a quite funny role and i think he is a very good actor as a whole but although you're sometimes laughing and enjoying yourself a lot, sometimes you feel a bit trapped by it in a way.<br/><br/>The idea of ghosts being real is a whole stupid part of this film and it wasn't brilliantly done, definitely not one of Burton's best films, but it's entertaining.<br/><br/>6/10"
"tavm","6","2","3","20 May 2012"," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's version of Dark Shadows is a partly uneven yet still enjoyable movie of a cult classic TV series
","I had first been familiar with the TV series ""Dark Shadows"" when it was mentioned in a book about cult TV programs. But it wasn't until the early '90s TV series remake that I even watched anything to do with one Barnabas Collins who was portrayed by Ben Cross in that one. I remember highly enjoying it and was disappointed when it was cancelled after only 13 eps. So while I admire Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and the work they've done together for so long, I was a little disappointed by their latest opus in making a film of this long-beloved series. I mean, I found many of the '70s references funny but also a bit distracting since they didn't seem to advance any characterizations or plot developments. And one doesn't really get the connection Barnabas and Victoria Winters have to each other despite the flashback scene involving the latter. In fact, I enjoyed the scenes Depp has with Eva Green as Angelique better. And Michelle Pfeiffer doesn't really have much to do as matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard even when she uses her gun so that was another disappointment. But, like I said, there were some pretty funny '70s flavor involving The Carpenters, some Steve Miller lyrics, and an Alice Cooper appearance. And there is some respect concerning the translating of the plot lines and some characterizations of the show to the movie. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't expect a seriously epic drama concerning vampires, just go with the flow of part-camp, part-dramatic entertainment."
"mrspock1990","10","8","21","12 May 2012"," Tribute to original Dark Shadows
","I saw Dark Shadows yesterday, and I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good or bad movie based on the crappy preview, BUT I have to say the preview gives the actual movie little justice. It showed many of the jokes in the movie but none of the really good parts. The movie is amazing, everyone should go see it, Johnny Depp really payed tribute to the original series, Depp was even able to get down some of the mannerisms of the original Barnabas. Sure some of the things are slightly different, but it doesn't matter because the movies is so well made. Plus to top it all off, Alice Cooper was in the movie and Cooper is just amazing. So Tim Burton does it again and gives us another amazing movie!"

","Yes....I was one of those 13 year old kids who could hardly wait to get home from school to see Dark Shadows each day.....I had the soundtrack album, I had a thing for Barnabas, and Angelique scared the hell out of me. Anyway, I had read some of the reviews of the movie here on IMDb and was so disappointed - so many people are down on this movie. I tried to go with an open mind and saw the movie tonight. It was great! (I never started squirming in my seat - a sure sign that I am ready for a movie to be over so I can escape it. Well, I never squirmed once during this movie.) It is not 2 hours of ""hokey comedy"" - nor is it intended to be. This is what you would call ""black comedy"" - drama with moments of comic relief. If a person goes expecting it to be a steady stream of laughs then that person would be disappointed. It has some very tender moments - especially how Barnabas relates to and communicates with the troubled young David. The movie is respectful of the TV program and the fact of the matter is, though the TV show was a ""soap-drama"" and we loved it - even as a 13 year old sometimes I laughed because it was so ""hokey"". Those of us who remember the show know exactly what I mean by that. As for the movie, the acting, the cinematography, the scenery, and the music was all extremely good. The cinematography alone was beyond all expectations. My only complaint would be that Angelique was no where near as terrifying in the movie as she was in the TV program. Geez - she was one evil chick. And also, I have to say this: unfortunately for Johnny Depp, movie-goers seem to be judging him now by some bizarre Captain Jack Sparrow standard. Forget the bad reviews and think for yourself - give this movie a chance. You won't be sorry."

I don't like all of Tim Burton's films and have not seen all of them but his films have an immersive visual aesthetic suited for dark fairy tale settings. The visuals in the film are great and the story of spurned love never gets old. It's not much of a horror film and the comedy is light but I enjoyed it for the original story with striking gothic visuals. Original to me at least as I did not know where the story was going. The acting is great and typical of Tim Burton films the characters are charmingly weird. I was a little disappointed some characters were written off early. Overall I enjoyed it so not sure why critics and fans rated it so low. I certainly enjoyed this more than the Twilight movies which I've only seen one chapter in the series but fell asleep in theatres. I think critics and fans are comparing it to the original TV series and perhaps it does not quite rekindle the high water mark of the original. Since I am watching it with no nostalgic reference I enjoyed it for what it is. A comedy of spurned love with a macabre gothic twist."

","I don't believe we ever had a movie quite like this one, it really means a lot to me and I am giving it a very decent score from my perspective. The imagery is fantastic. From the costume design to the set design. There is a definitely a dark shadow persona hanging over.<br/><br/>I have to talk about the way it begins on the train. I was not expecting that from what I had thought would be a childish vampire movie. When Nights In White Satin kicked in I was blown away. That was the setup for the entire movie for me, it hooked me right into the drama. As it turns out, that train scene was a nod to the original creator of the television series who said, his inspiration was a dream he had in 1965 about a ""mysterious young woman on a train"". That is amazing.<br/><br/>Some fans were expecting gore and violence and special effects. I have to say the use of CGI special effects on this film was minimal. This was not another vampire film. This turned out to be a drama about a time period set in the 1970's, based on the original ABC series Dark Shadows that ran from 1965-1971.<br/><br/>For example, did you know that many of the cast of the original TV series starred in this, and some right before they passed away which makes this film special. Including David Shelby (Quentin), Lara Parker (Angelique), Victoria Winters (Governess), and Johnathan Frid (Barnabas). They got to see a modern interpretation of a quirky television show. This film was just as quirky and odd, and with an amazing soundtrack to boot.<br/><br/>Over the vail of darkness there was a humorous touch, so really this was a comedy-drama in the best of examples. I have nothing but great things to say about this release. I wasn't expecting horror and guts, and wasn't expecting an Oscar award winning performance either because it was not supposed to be serious. Comedies have never been treated all too well by the critics. I think this was an amazing tribute to the show.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is also known for being a perfectionist. I was told he watched almost every episode of the series to nail the part of Barnabas. I find that admirable that they were able to recreate the characters for the big screen.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one fault, it would be that I wish the end had gone on for even longer. They never made a sequel and maybe it's best they didn't. I know this film had a big impact on younger viewers who had never watched the show or heard the music. I know it did on me and will never forget it."
"tabuno","9","1","1","17 January 2019"," A Difficult But Successful Mix of Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Horror
","13 May 2012. It's never easy and usually impossible to direct a good fusion of comedy, drama, horror, but Tim Burton successfully handles the task with this edgy but delightful black comedy that keeps the integrity of the vampire myth while acknowledging the current cultural influence of contemporary novels and television series' role of horror characters in society. There are elements from Practical Magic (1998) and Death Becomes Her (1992) along with same uneasy mix of oil and water as the comedy is interspersed with darker, suggestive bloody horror, and even Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) in their physical interplay together. In a way, Tim Burton has been able to transform these darker elements placing them into the light of day, transform the more acceptable animated horror that is soften by its more unreal forms of cartoon images such as Coraline (2009) into a idealistic live action romance drama, that heightens the good and evil elements that underlie our own realities in everyday living.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has deliciously and perhaps deliberately created a set design and directorial, script presentation that slightly hyper-exaggerates the original Dark Shadows television melodrama (1966-71) and pays tribute to its more low-budget elements all the while keeping the quality of a full feature film experience. There were some consistently funny out of time ironic scenes, there were some emotionally penetrating scenes, and there was pushing the limits of edgy horror, yet with all the entertainment power at Mr. Burton's disposal.<br/><br/>The everyday ethical dilemma of sexual relationships are on brilliant display in this morning, love spurned, love lost, love found and even the major characters are never stereotyped and have sufficient depth to elevate this movie into a more multi-dimensional experience those those willing to accept the penetrating look at our own foibles. The core theme of eternal love and eternal hatred are strongly integrated into this movie making it a solid foundation on which Burton is able to extend Johnny Depp's reach creating an inspiring and haunting, love story around one of the most famous mythical character's of our times and in a major way is more true to the power of love as powerfully shown in Dracula (1992) at the beginning of the movie but unlike Dracula (1992) which transforms this love into something corrupted by the end of the movie (a masculine form of jealousy), Dark Shadows (2012) stays true to the more resonate message of the vampire myth (a feminine form of idealistic romance).<br/><br/>In many ways, this movie represents the continuing advancement of the craft of film-making and follows in the recent footsteps of other benchmark films such as the comedy-drama All Above Steve (2009), darker animated fantasy of Coraline (2009), screwball comedy of Ghost Town (2008), the underplayed but more subtle humor of Get Smart (2008), and more adult contemporary child adventure of Super 8(2011) and another darker comedy with Adam Sandler in Funny People(2009)."

","On coastal Maine, a Vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is released in 1972 after almost 200 years in captivity and reacquaints himself with his family's chateau & the nearby fishing village. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Collins matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter the in-house shrink, Eva Green a conniving witch, Bella Heathcote the reincarnation of Barnabas' long-lost love and Chloë Grace Moretz a 15 year-old punk.<br/><br/>Directed by Tim Burton, ""Dark Shadows"" (2012) isn't far removed in tone from his ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999), which also featured Depp as the protagonist, although I suppose ""Shadows"" throws in a little more humor. I've never seen the TV soap opera Dark Shadows or the subsequent two movies, so I can't compare this movie to them. All I know is that I liked this rendition quite a bit, just as I liked the inexplicably reviled ""The Lone Ranger"" (2013).<br/><br/>The October/November ambiance (i.e. Halloween-season) is to die for and Depp as Barnabas Collins maintains your interest throughout. He's obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don't get the hubbub over Moretz, but she's a'right (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo. I should add that the opening credits sequence with ""Nights in White Satin"" is cinema at its finest.<br/><br/>The movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England (Devon, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Cornwall & Farnham) and Scotland (Mull, Argyll and Bute) with exteriors of the chateau shot at Trafalgar Castle School, Whitby, Ontario, Canada.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"
"mike48128","6","1","1","6 August 2016"," Starts out great and loses its way in the middle
","Even John Depp can't save this one. I am assuming that you are somewhat familiar with the other previous versions. Most of the beginning is straight ""historic"" story-telling and it is riveting. The chain-wrapped coffin of Barnabas Collins is found in a construction site. After 200 years of imprisonment, Barnabas drains 11 victims in no time. He proceeds to Collinswood Mansion after first walking through town, seeing the club scene in 1974. He tells only a select few that he is the real thing, vampire and all. To the others he is their distant English cousin. All the familiar characters are there including Willie Loomis, who doesn't have as much to do in this version but he becomes Barnabas' servant as always. Angelique the Witch never died, and she runs the ""Angel Bay"" fisheries which is the more successful cannery as the Collins family is the poor second cannery and has lost it's former glory. Dr. Hoffman is along to to try and alter Barnabas (and her own) bloodwork. As always, Victoria and Josette are played by the same young girl. ""Vicky"" is the reincarnation of Barnabas' lost love. The first half is not too bad, but then the story gets choppy, sloppy, and uneven. Angelique and Barnabas have a steamy love scene, Alice Cooper guests at a ""Happening"" party which falls flat. Then all ""Hell"" breaks loose. The witch entombs him and little David saves him. There is a huge Witch Vs. Vampire fight-to-the-death, and eventually both the cannery and the great house burn-to-the-ground. There of course is a lot more going before this, involving werewolves, ghosts, and Barnabas arrested for the murder of Dr. Hoffman. She betrayed him so he killed her and drank her blood. Way too ""campy"" in the 2nd half and choppy editing, although some of that could be for ""running time"". The soundtrack is horrible and includes ""Carpenters"" Songs. Finally, they get it right at the end as Vicky takes a swan dive off the watery breakers at the cliff. She dies and the spirit of Josette is restored to life. Barnabas falls with her and is restored to human form! A very financially successful film in spite of itself!"
"Dr_Coulardeau","6","1","1","22 October 2015"," No magic, no fascination, just a banal story
","TIM BURTON – JOHNNY DEPP – DARK SHADOWS – 2012<br/><br/>No matter how spectacular this film is and its special effects are, the film itself is a remake of at least half a dozen story lines already famous and vastly imitated on all screens. Anne Rice brought the vampires out of their closet with Lestat de Lioncourt from Auvergne, France, and that has brought to life a myriad if not a host of vampires of all types, genres and sexes (definitely more than two). Then she dared make her vampires meet with her witches, the Mayfair family from Montpellier, France, and even beyond, and that brought some new episodes of great power and that has so far not been exploited in the cinema or on television, at least at that level. And in 2012 she started a new series with werewolves, mind you, Reuben Golding and many more. But in the meantime the BBC produced a phenomenal series with vampires, werewolves and ghosts living in the same house and trying to pass for humans, Being Human shot in Bristol, GB, 2008-2013, immediately remade in Montreal. So there is really nothing new under the sun, really nothing.<br/><br/>Then the family curse is so trite and banal it does not bring anything new. And the dear cursed vampire will win in the end. Banal since we knew it from the start and he will win by the destruction of his main enemy and releasing a werewolf in the world, and anyway he does not really win since he is helped by a ghost and a child. Brilliant and pathetic.<br/><br/>The spectacular special effects do not retrieve this film that has no real plot nor density. A film for people who just want things close to maybe after all we could say some creative inspiration without being too creative because I don't want to have a headache. This time Mr. Tim Burton is making money more than a film that will last beyond the summer matinees for young teenagers, well not too young though because it might be restricted. <br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"By-TorX-1","6","1","1","13 April 2015"," Less Would Have Been Much More
","If Burton had scaled back the action to include only Barnabas, Angelique and Victoria/Josette, then the film would have worked 100% better than it does. However, he tries to shoehorn many of the elements contained within Dark Shadows the series (which runs to countless episodes) and as a result the film collapses under its own weight, with ghosts and werewolves aplenty thrown into the chaotic climax. The film looks great, and Eva Green is as marvellous as ever, (with Depp in camply amusing form, albeit in a role that he basically sleepwalks through) but the tone is all over the place. One minute the film is Gothic horror and vampiric murders, the next it's slapstick comedy, then it's all Austin Powers 'man-out-of-time' farce until finally, sadly, it is an empty and noisy CGI-fest. Furthermore, Chloe Grace Moretz and Helena Bonham Carter give the film little to nothing (I'm not blaming the actresses though, as their characters are just not fleshed out enough, and Moretz's supernatural contribution is simply too little and comes way too late in the game to give anything but palm-slaps to the face on the part of the viewers), and so they just take up valuable screen-time. Perhaps directors shouldn't remake shows that they love, as it seems to seldom pan out well."
"yaoyuan","7","1","1","19 July 2014"," Was not so good
","Coming from someone who has never seen the TV series, or learn of their existence before reading the reviews:<br/><br/>This movie feels shallow, the themes are stated rather than portrayed, the characterization incomplete, fragmented and felt unconvincing. And there are some sequences, for example the last fight sequence, that felt awkwardly hastened and incomplete (statues came alive, and then?) at times. The only part that I felt was well done was the ""endure"" theme and the destruction of family house.<br/><br/>Just a quirky film, fun to watch, good to experience the interesting seventies X vampire match-up, and of course Depp as the main attraction, but overall the film really has no staying power."
"SnoopyStyle","6","1","1","31 August 2013"," looks really good, but just not fun
","Barnabas (Johnny Depp) is a successful man in 1770s town of Collinsport, Maine. He makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a powerful witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). She in turn dooms him into a vampire, and then buries him alive. Two centuries later, Barnabas is accidentally released into the world of 1972. His Collinwood Manor has fallen into disrepair. The dysfunctional remnants of the Collins family have fared little better.<br/><br/>This has the great Gothic look of Tim Burton. He is able to have both a 70s look and an old Gothic look. However it is very difficult to root for Barnabas who is essentially a killing monster. It is not fun. And it is not funny. Although there is a monster sex scene that produced a few smiles."
"blanche-2","6","1","1","16 July 2013"," another Burton-Depp collaboration
","I agree with some of the reviews, that ""Dark Shadows"" director Tim Burton didn't know if he was doing a camp comedy, a horror film, a romance, or a drama.<br/><br/>He would have been best to go with the camp comedy in this 2012 film, since that comes off the best. Loved Barnabas experiencing McDonald's and television and thinking the Carpenters worked with wood. I loved the 1972 settings and references. And I loved the soundtrack.<br/><br/>There are lots of special effects here, some are fun, some just aren't. I saw this as a rental and I think it probably comes off much better as a rental.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is sheer perfection, so serious, so intense, you can't help but laugh at some of his line deliveries.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances are fine, but Depp is fabulous.<br/><br/>Depp obviously loves working with Burton and vice versa, but let's face it, not all of their work together is inspired. This film is based on a flimsy script that could have been so much better, if only Burton had decided on which way he wanted to go. The comedy stuff was great."
"rachelandfilms","5","1","1","1 July 2013"," A disappointing addition to the Depp-Burton resume...
","Dark Shadows sees the return of working-duo Depp and Burton in their 8th feature film together and like their previous cinematic jaunts we are given a weird and sometimes-wonderful slice of Gothic pie. For those unaware this is based on the long-running TV show of the same name which aired from 1966-1971. In its time the show was a popular staple and its fans include Depp, Burton and Pfeiffer themselves, which perhaps explains why this adaptation was made. I certainly don't think its Burton adhering to the vampire-fad that's been seeping into cinema and TV since Twilight graced our screens. Indeed this film bears no similarity to the teen-fad that is Twilight, with Burton lending a dash of his trademark dark humour to the vampy proceedings. <br/><br/>Of course when it comes to Gothic Burton is the unofficial King of the genre, with each film in his directorial past reminiscent of the stereotypes of the genre. In this film that Gothic edge is brought to the forefront with hanging buttresses, hidden passageways and foggy settings contributing to the dark and gloomy atmosphere of the film, not to mention the pre-requisite crazy witch-bitch (It's not really Gothic without that last one now is it?). Said crazy witch-bitch is played by the talented Eva Green who brings a quirky-hilarity to the role of scorned and vengeful Angelique who has some serious issues when it comes to Depp's Barnabus Collins. Angelique embodies that one ex you have who just can't seem to forgive and forget and this is shown to the extreme when she kills Barnabus' family and fiancé and curses him to eternal damnation by making him a bloodsucking vampire. To add salt to the wounds she sets the village locals on him on your stereotypical dark- and-stormy-night who chain him in a coffin where he stays put for 196 years (the devils in the details) until he is accidentally set free. <br/><br/>In terms of this films enjoyability I think that might be somewhat hindered by its 'all-over-the-place' quality, with too many sub-plots confusing the films main purpose and too many characters vying for attention in this ambitious production. For example the film begins by introducing us to the Collins' new governess ""Victoria Winters"" (played by Bella Heathcote) and so I assumed she would take centre-stage (alongside Depp of course) throughout the film, which was apparently a foolish assumption to make. Though this character does have a romantic link to Depp's their relationship is never given enough screen time to feel authentic, nor is Heathcote's character throughout the film in general, though as it turns out her genesis is vital to the plots cohesion. This lack of screen time was not only irritating but seemed clumsy on Burton's part (she's the romantic lead after all. It would be like a 2-hour Harry Potter film with only 30 minutes of said character being shown!). <br/><br/>If you would like to continue reading my thoughts on this film then go here...

"MLDinTN","5","1","1","8 April 2013"," campy vampire tale....
","was Barnabas good or bad? That is what I was trying to figure out after watching this. On one hand, he is supposed to be the protagonist who is going up against evil and on the other hand he is killing construction workers and spaced out campers.<br/><br/>Barnabas is a vampire that is released after being underground for 200 years. So there is a lot of campy jokes about how things have changed, from roads to cars to parties. He finds that some relatives are now living in his house and he conveniently has a room filled with hidden treasure, so that takes care of money issues. The witch that buried him is still running the town and she is still obsessed about him. Also, Barnabas's love has been resurrected in Victoria, a girl living with the family. So the film is about Barnabas trying to get rid of the with, Angie. And as it turns out half the family have some sort of supernatural powers.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Seemed like this was thrown together to take advantage of the popularity of vampires. It's not a comedy, but it's not to be taken serious. Don't go out of your way to see it."
"sledgehammer86","5","1","1","25 December 2012"," Too cheeky for its own good, script lacks
","Pretty average. OK for a random evening, but quite unmemorable too. Several plot lines are thrown out in the early stages of the movie, but then altogether left alone. There is an attempt at humor, it does work at points, but it also feels a little forced and the whole thing becomes too cheeky because of it.<br/><br/>I had low expectations about Johnny Depp after liking him less and less in recent movies, including Burton's movies. But Depp is OK here. Still, Depp, as well as Eva Green, Johnny Lee Miller, Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter, while turning in good performances, also are too caricatural. A little too much one-liners. Cheeky is the word. I do not blame the actors, it is the script.<br/><br/>Also, there is some unnecessary CGI/post-processing. For example, the docks and ships at the beginning of the movie look very unnatural."
"atreus_4971","5","1","1","18 December 2012"," Left feeling sleepy and hollow
","So, Dark Shadows. I was waiting for this film for a long time as I am a big Tim Burton fan, and a huge Johnny Depp fan. But this venture was confused and really missed the mark for me.<br/><br/>With Tim Burton you know what you are getting, usually. Yet Dark Shadows seemed to be suffering from an identity crisis. What am I? A Gothic romance? A spoof? Have you ever looked at a magazine stall and wondered why each genre of magazine, be it womens, mens, gardening or whatever look exactly the same? It's because people en masse need that. And with Dark Shadows it lost it's direction from the very outset. I spent the first hour wondering if I should laugh or not. I was confused. But I think not as much as the guys who actually funded this movie.<br/><br/>I want to reiterate, I love Burton, Depp and Bonham-Carter. It was great to see Michelle Pfeiffer again (and she was great as it happens). But I felt let down by this movie. Something didn't quite work for any of them, like they had been miscast, or the script was lacking, or perhaps the idea was just not right. The chemistry was a little off and the intended jokes missed by a mile. I sincerely hope that this is just the one that Burton 'experimented' with and now we can all go back to the comfort of his genius. It would be awful to think that he has allowed his ego to take over.<br/><br/>I don't do spoilers. I think people should watch a film for themselves rather than read reviews, but I also know that people do read reviews and I don't want anyone to think this is rubbish. It's not. It bounces along with the usual Burton quirkiness, but somehow it just didn't gel. I paint, and I know that sometimes despite experience and best efforts not every painting is good. Some just annoy for no tangible reason.<br/><br/>Overall, it's nothing different, nothing of note. Bit boring, and sadly even Depp fails to impress (first time ever). I kinda feel sorry for Tim. He won't be happy with this one, but at least he got paid."
"Karl Self","6","1","1","15 December 2012"," Dark Shadows, bad dialogues
","Dark Shadows is visually a great Tim Burton movie, but the script is totally insufficient. It's based on the eponymous late-1960ies soap opera, which is still one of the longest TV series (in terms of episodes) in history. I didn't know about the series, and it's hard to gauge how many out of the 2012 audience have it on their radar -- very few will have actually seen it. Director Tim Burton is apparently a huge fan of the series, which may have lead to him getting carried away. Or maybe condensing 1125 episodes into a 90 minutes feature film is an impossible feat to begin with. What Burton came up with is the story of a 200 year old vampire resurfacing in the colourful early 1970ies (roughly the era when the run of the original series ended), which is mainly characterised by macramé, troll dolls and Alice Cooper. And a few stoner hippies. Unlike the original series, the 2012 feature film is a comedy, and the culture clash between the ancient vampire and his modern-age family and surroundings could have been a functional plot motor, but unfortunately it falls completely flat because the script -- and especially the dialogues -- sucks. Hard to fathom in a movie that cost US$ 150 million. The result is a movie that is so disappointing that I can't even recommend it for home viewing."

He must act and protect before it becomes too late to get tangled by ferocious witch.<br/><br/>Tim Burton (Sleepy Hollow , Big Fish, Alice in Wonderland) is always a director to look forward to as his films are fantasy , adventurous , dark and humorous. Dark Shadows promises to fall into the category but is bogged down a weak screenplay and even weaker direction. The movie starts off very very well when Johnny Depp is buried by the villages after being betrayed by his ex-lover and then he returns back after 200 years only to rejuvenate his family business and protect his family but things gets out of hand in the middle and looses further steam down the film. In fact , it becomes so irritating that you might want to skip the movie in between and go and grab some free air. Tim Burton is not in form this time. He choose the right story but fails to make an impact. Screenplay is lousy along with poor dialogues. Art direction is wonderful with eye-catching cinematography and visual effects.The only thing , I liked about the movie was Johnny Depp's candy floss performance.

","Johnny Depp and Tim Burton over the years have obviously stamped their mark pretty deep in the world of Hollywood. They have developed titles such as Edward Scissor Hands, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Facotry. All of these films impressed me and I thought i would expect nothing less from the 2012 film Dark Shadows.<br/><br/>Firstly, this movie did have its highs and i immensely enjoyed them like its impressive cast. But this movie also had its lows which unfortunately overshadowed the highs (no pun intended). The plot lacked detail and everything seemed to be happening very quickly. It involves a centuries old vampire being set free from his coffin like prison. After this he decides to continue his legacy and help his present descendants prosper in their fishing business. This plot is certainly different and could have been a real success. The characters in this film, mainly the family are developed effectively but no character wowed me. Even though Johhny Depp did deliver his usual brilliance their was a lack of reaction with other character to build interesting relationships.<br/><br/>Their was the same dark and slightly wondrous feel to the movie which is no doubt created by the hand of Tim Burton even that couldn't patch the hole in plot development. The ending was somewhat boring and again had no wow factor unlike the epic conclusion in Alice in Wodnerland. It is also a comedy and their is parts where i chuckled a little but the balance that Burton provides between horror and comedy was tipped here with no sense of direction.<br/><br/>All in all this movie disappointed me. I was expecting a dark and comedic joy ride with a fantastic climax. But because the movie lacked this i give it a unsatisfying 6/10."
"anne-217-54013","10","7","18","12 May 2012"," Absolutely absurd and wonderfully unpredictable
","There are not many movies like this one. One doesn't see whats coming. The lead characters aren't heroes or morally strong. Everyone is wonderfully twisted and very broken. Different. Michelle pfeiffer and Johnny depp do a wonderful job in creating the melodrama wibe required for remaking a soap-opera. When you watch this you ought to remember the whole drama part of it is intentionally over the top. Keeping that in mind the unpredictability is to be appreciated. My opinion is that critics are too tough on Johnny Depp. They are so to speak used to his brilliance. Depp' s Barnabbas is another great character. It seems he has already given so many memorable performances so that people cannot fully take them all in. If this would be the first Depp film a person sees, that person would surely think it was a one of a kind role performance."
"drzaius12","10","8","22","11 May 2012"," This is the one Tim Burton will be remembered for...
","This movie was great! It's not perfect. It has the worst ad campaign and trailer I have seen for a modern film. The film is a lot of fun. It's not a comedy. There are some scenes in the middle that seem out of place, like him brushing his teeth. But most of the film is cool and hip. The TV show was lurid and melodramatic. I saw the film House of Dark Shadows in the theater on opening day in 1970 and the theater was empty. That film was awful, but the follow up Night of Dark Shadows was even worse. Burton's film has received poor reviews. They can't accept that the old show is lousy. I just watched the MPI collection. This is Tim Burton's best film. Unfortunately, it is being overshadowed by a giant wrestling match called The Avengers. It's much harder to develop real characters, and that's what Tim Burton has done. It's about time someone acknowledges what a genus he is. PS> He's made several stinkers especially Planet of the Apes."
"Mahan18","7","5","12","12 May 2012"," Welcome Back, Burton
","I really liked this movie, and I am seriously confused about why everyone else seems to hate it. Yeah, okay, it's nowhere near perfect: Having the daughter be a werewolf? Pointless. Having Bonham Carter give Depp a blowjob? Stupid. Having Elfman on music once again, and yet using mostly 70's music for the soundtrack anyway? Confusing. The sequel baiting at the end with Bonham Carter being alive? Annoying.<br/><br/>BUT, with that said, the acting is really good, the story, while definitely leaning on cliché's wall, didn't take EVERYTHING it could of and actually came through in some areas, the effects were quite impressive, and the humour, while probably not to everyone's tastes, got a few chuckles out of me. While the music isn't all Elfman's, it's still a good soundtrack that works with the movie, and Elfman's own still has the punch it always does. And hey, Alice friggin' Cooper, how could you go wrong?<br/><br/>Given how far Burton could sink in terms of remakes (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, Planet Of The Apes, Alice In Wonderland), I saw this as being at least able to stand on its own. No, I haven't seen the original show or movies.<br/><br/>Burton is one of my favourite directors, and after having been less than impressed with his last few movies, this is seems like a return to form, however gradual.

","They GET it! Tim Burton, et al. have delivered a ton of the gothic/60s mashup fun that was the ""Dark Shadows"" experience. They've stuck to the original storyline and characters, while, of course, blowing out the original claustrophobic sets and expanding into a majestic and wonderful Collinwood. Johnny Depp was the perfect Barnabas; he gets it too -- much of the delight we took in watching the old TV show was seeing Johnathan Frid rising above the insane pace of production which made it hard for him to keep his lines straight (we called it ""What's My Line?"") to maintain the dignity and charisma of his vampire character through the most crackpot plot twists. Mr. Depp has that same buoyant dignity that is the best foil for humor. The (unashamedly borrowed) plot strings that became so tangled that only an escape to the past or to a parallel universe could untangle them gave hours of mirth to my roommate and me, when whoever had seen that day's show tried to fill the other in on what had happened. So even the dizzy ending of this movie is OK with me. <br/><br/>There's never a dull moment. The cast is all fine, especially Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard), Eva Green (Angelique), and Helena Bonham Carter hilariously filling the shoes of Grayson Hall as Dr. Julia Hoffman. Besides the witty acting, there's always something eye- popping or funny to see if you look closely, like when after we see Mrs. Stoddard's ""macramé closet"" (how 1970 is that?) we later see her wearing tiny macramé earrings. And how special to see Hammer Films' great Dracula, Christopher Lee, who must have inspired Mr. Frid, getting the vampire hypnosis treatment himself. I'd love to see more of these characters (sequel!). Oh, another thing: terrific period music! Makes me miss those days. Hard to believe it's been 40 years."
"Horror_FreakO","1","4","9","22 May 2012"," I didn't see it
","Yes that's right. I didn't see this movie, and I never will!!! How dare Burton the Bastard make a comedy about Dark Shadows! I grew up watching the Dark Shadows series, and was so very excited to hear that a Dark Shadows movie was being made. I always dreamed what the series would have been like, if only it would have had a decent budget.<br/><br/>The sad thing is, this should have been so easy. This movie should have been a Gothic thriller with vampires, witches, ghosts, and goblins. Instead, Burton the Bastard turned one of my greatest childhood memories into a steaming piece of dung.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows was not a comedy. In fact, the series never had one remotely funny moment in it. It was a serious horror drama about a family that was cursed.<br/><br/>Instead of making this movie, why didn't Burton the Bastard just buy every Dark Shadows the Series DVD, and spit on them? It would have been more respectful, and less disappointing."
"Filmazer","6","4","9","12 May 2012"," Mildly Entertaining - especially for Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fans.
","I have never seen the TV series of Dark Shadows but have seen all of the movies that Tim Burton had directed (all except Ed Wood, one of TB's finest, yet don't ask me why.) Compared with his more recent movies, I would put Dark Shadows somewhere between Sweeney Todd and Charlie & The Chocolate Factory/Alice in Wonderland in terms of entertainment value and classic Tim Burton.<br/><br/>However, I must admit that due to the poor reviews by critics, the movie's poor trailer and the memory of disappointment generated from seeing his last few movies, I went to see this one with much lowered expectations.<br/><br/>During the first half of the movie, I was mildly entertained and was thinking:""This isn't so bad, I'm quite liking it."" Perhaps the best part was its middle, when we were treated with a montage displaying the high point of the film - when Barnabas has just been inducted into the Collins family and was seen taking charge in reviving the family to its former wealth and glory. The segment was appropriately accompanied by The Carpenters song ""Top of the World.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as the name of that song suggests for us - there is only one way to go when you are at the top of the world - and hence the movie just went downhill from there on. It became neither funny nor serious, character-driven nor plot driven. It just doesn't know where to go and became quite a mess that stopped building interest for the audience. It became a personal performance reel for Johnny Depp's Barnabas.<br/><br/>With all said, I still think the movie isn't bad, there are some endearing aspects that is hard for me to put into words. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's Tim Burton's resistance of growing up as an artist/director. The odd thing is, I don't wish for anything better despite its flaws."
"Chris_Pandolfi","7","4","9","11 May 2012"," Depp Finally Lands His Dream Role
","In a 2007 interview with ""Entertainment Weekly,"" Johnny Depp proudly stated that, as he grew up watching ""Dark Shadows,"" he wanted to be the vampire Barnabas Collins. ""I think lots of kids did,"" he said. ""He was super-mysterious, with that really weird hairdo and the wolf's-head cane. Good stuff."" Depp is now luckier than ever to be dear friends with Tim Burton; apart from the fact that he helmed this year's film adaptation of the Gothic soap opera, he gave Depp the chance to live his dream by casting him as Barnabas Collins. I grant you that this is nepotism, but you'd be hard pressed to convince me that any living actor would have been better suited for this role. Depp is of an elite group of actors who can disappear into a role so thoroughly that it's difficult to tell where the real person ends and the character begins.<br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" is just plain fun, simultaneously an homage to and a parody of the original soap opera. In much the same way as Burton's own ""Beetlejuice,"" it represents a delicate balancing act between comedy and horror. Unlike ""Beetlejuice,"" the comedy has a bit more bite, and the horror is more elegant and brooding, as if it was taken straight from the pages of a Victorian Gothic novel. As is the case with all Tim Burton movies, it's also a triumph of art direction and set decoration. Praise must be given to production designer Rick Heinrichs, whose vision for Collinwood Manor playfully blends whimsy with authentic period architecture. Here is a man who knows how to create the right atmosphere for a story like this. Surely he and Burton have influenced each other, given the fact that the two have now collaborated on thirteen projects.<br/><br/>A prologue sequence serves as an expository introduction to Barnabas Collins. When he was a boy in 1752, he and his parents sailed from Liverpool to Maine to expand their family-run fishing business. The city of Collinsport was established, and over the course of fifteen years, Collinwood Manor was built. As a young man, Barnabas made the mistake of spurning an infatuated servant girl named Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), who also happened to be a witch. Enraged, she took her revenge on Barnabas by killing his parents and hypnotizing every young woman he fell in love with into jumping off a cliff. The last of them was his true love, Josette du Pres (Bella Heathcote). Barnabas attempted to join her in death, but was instead cursed by Angelique into becoming a vampire (an interesting new twist on the vampire mythos, to say the least). She then turned the townspeople against him. Ultimately, he was buried in a chained coffin the middle of the forest.<br/><br/>We then flash forward 196 years to 1972, at which point a young woman named Victoria Winters (also played by Heathcote) travels by train up to Collinsport, where she hopes to become the new governess for the remaining descendants of the Collins family. She arrives at a now dilapidated Collinwood and meets: The matriarchal Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer); her moody and rebellious teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz); her stodgy and greedy brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her ten-year-old nephew David (Gulliver McGrath), who lost his mother and claims he can still speak to her; David's live-in psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), who is herself in desperate need of counseling; and the manor's caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earl Haley), a perpetually drunk goofball.<br/><br/>Barnabas is accidentally liberated from his prison by a construction crew, most of whom are unfortunately sucked dry of their blood. Despite the astronomical generation gap – he's understandably bewildered by a McDonald's sign, a TV set, car headlights, asphalt, a lava lamp, a mirror ball, and the fact that women are allowed to be doctors – he returns to Collinwood determined to revamp his once thriving fishing business and in turn restore his family's honor. The competition, and this should not surprise anyone, is presided over by none other than Angelique, who now calls herself Angie. When she learns that Barnabas has escaped, she simultaneously vows to win him back and to destroy his business and family for good.<br/><br/>The film is obviously supposed to in part be funny. Much of the humor stems from Barnabas' difficultly in adapting to late twentieth-century American culture. This includes having to contend with a group of pot-smoking hippies and an appearance by Alice Cooper, who Barnabas declares is the ugliest woman he has ever seen. But it's also supposed to be Gothic and melodramatic, ghosts, werewolves, black magic, and even a romance between Barnabas and the secretive Victoria all finding their way into the plot. I've heard complaints about the meandering storyline and sudden shifts in tone, which I find strange given that the beloved original series frequently made use of overly dramatic plot twists. You cannot expect ""Dark Shadows"" to be anything more than what it is.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","I always like Johnny Depp. He can really play the quirky characters, like Edward Scissorhands or Willy Wonka. He was great here as Barnabas Collins. He looked like Michael Jackson when he donned the dark fedora and sunglasses.<br/><br/>Johnny's delivery of Barnabas was hilarious. He carried the jokes well. He looked really gory with blood on his face. He just had to have those meals, though.<br/><br/>Angelique would never take no for an answer. She dogged Barnabas mercilessly, and I am glad he got in the final blows for her demise. She was a real tormentor.<br/><br/>I saw the original Dark Shadows TV series, way back in the day. I liked it. I also liked Jonathan Frid as Barnabas. Johnny's lines are funnier, but I think that Frid's lines were of a drier type of humor.<br/><br/>I liked Jackie Earle Haley's quiet performance. It was low-keyed and humorous. He must have been the handyman or caretaker of the mansion. He drove the car great. This is a marked difference of character compared to his disturbed rapist in ""Little Children"". Of course, he is known from his youth in ""Bad News Bears"" and ""Breaking Away"". He is very versatile.<br/><br/>The special effects were fabulous. They could be funny, and also scary.<br/><br/>Johnny's Barnabas has a way of surprising people. In addition, he is also very thoughtful. He is astute to old times and new times. He even provided the real Alice Cooper for his descendant's party. That was very kind and caring. Barnabas at first thought Alice was female.<br/><br/>It was nice that Barnabas wanted to bring back his family's fortunes from their near demise. He had a positive and determined effort to revive the family treasury and community leadership.<br/><br/>Did he get to spend eternity with Josette? Would they live forever? This was at the end.<br/><br/>Tim Burton, you are always great.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Dan Collins created this black Macabe thriller back in the 1960s and despite it being a bit of a shock to audiences, it nevertheless became a lasting entertainment staple for years. Now Master craftsman and famed Director Tim Burton has taken John August's legendary tale and brought it to the Big Screen with his version and is simply calling it "" Dark Shadows. "" The main character is of course Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) who found love during the 18th century but was challenged by a resentful and spite filled witch (Eva Green) who promised is she could not have his love, would forever condemn him to live as a Vampire. Entomed for two hundred years, Barnabas is accidentally released and now plans to have his revenge on the witch who still lives. The movie is well made, the characters sincere and the dialog is apt for the cast which includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, and Eva Green, Angelique Bouchard, Gulliver McGrath and not surprisingly the great and equally legendary actor Christopher Lee who recalls his Vampire in the 60s'. The masterful film is musically crafted by Danny Elfman who added his superior scores to such Classics as 'Nighmare before Christmas', with modern tunes such as 'Theme from a Summer place.' There is much in this film which will earn it's place with other notables, but rest assure it goes beyond that and surely will also become a Classic. Easily recommended to any seeking true entertainment. ****"
"pekinman","1","3","6","10 August 2013"," There is no where to go but up.
","I love Tim Burton. Several of his movies rank in my top 100 of all time. Sadly his adaptation of a popular television cult series, Dark Shadows, skirts the borders of Amateur land.<br/><br/>There are numerous touches of the Burton dark humor, and his casting is, once again, beyond criticism, but they are ALL wasted on what has to be one of the worst scripted screenplays I've sat through since Ed Wood's (ironically enough) Plan 9 from Outer Space. The difference is that old classic of bad movie-making is funny and memorable, this hollow mess is instantly forgettable. <br/><br/>The cast is wasted. Johnny Depp does his best, which is very good, with very little. This man is funny, one of the great comedians, and his timing of lines is perfect, yet, he cannot save this movie all by himself, from being interminable at 113 minutes, and boring beyond belief. It took me 4 days to get through it, turning it on and off, finally forcing myself to watch the incredibly lame climactic battle and limp ending. It is as if the production team simply gave up after the death of Dr Julia Hoffman (the splendidly funny Helena Bonham-Carter). <br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer makes almost no impression at all as Elizabeth Collins. This isn't her fault, she has nothing much to work with as far as character development (as in ZERO) and the fabulously beautiful Eva Green looks absurd in a very bad blonde wig. Her American accent comes and goes as well. <br/><br/>The CGI effects are okay, nothing special. I realize this movie is a probably intended as a send- up of the original kitschy TV show, a program I watched religiously as a kid, but I was never certain, watching Burton's effort, whether it was meant to be this stupid or not.<br/><br/>The most interesting performance, and one of the funniest, is by the girl who plays Caroline Collins, (sorry I've forgotten her name). She has a future in Burton movies I hope.<br/><br/>The whole concept should have been chucked in the shredder on Day One of the initial pitch.<br/><br/>Even the mighty slip and fall on their faces once in awhile. I hope it never happens again to Tim Burton. I feel his pain."

","Wow, where to start...First off I am a fan of Tim Burton's movies and especially Tim Burton & Johnny Depp collaborations, but this time it just did not work. The story was a bore and dragged along. Even though it was centered around a 200 year old vampire it wasn't believable. It was just bad. It almost seem the cast was making it up as they went along but never quite connected as a group. Weird, confusing plot twist like Chloë Grace Moretz character in the last 10-15 minutes of the movie is suddenly a werewolf with zero explanation or even a slight hint leading up to this!!!! WHAT!!??<br/><br/>I've seen better plots and more convincing acting in a high school drama play. Thankfully I didn't waste my time & money seeing this at the theater but I'm still disappointed I wasted the space in a BB queue. Don't rent, RUN!"
"samilou90","10","3","6","23 October 2012"," Dark with a touch of light.
","All right, This is my first review, so if it's jumbled. Sorry. I marked Spoiler because I don't want to be blacklisted. Any-way, I'm extremely bias because i'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and of course the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. I swear this trio is the triple threat of Hollywood. In my own opinion of course.<br/><br/>Okay so The movie. Honestly, I thought it was great. I mean Johnny Depp was impeccable. He plays Mr. Collins, with such depth, and makes the vampire such a charismatic character. I will say that the movie was not as funny as the previews showed. It did have some humor moments though. Tim Burton, is great with putting his dark and twisty with a dash of light into his movies though. I loved the Collins mansion, it was beautiful. <br/><br/>The Plot & story line is too known, a bad love and so she damned the whole family. After centuries still holding a grudge. I mean its just predictable. I thought the writing was pretty good, again speaking of a completely bias opinion because of how much I love all three of these fantastic actors / actresses. <br/><br/>They shouldn't get all the credit though because Chloe Mortez and Michelle Pfeiffer are damn good too. I didn't see the whole werewolf thing coming, and she did pretty damn good too. <br/><br/>I never saw the TV show .. so I can't compare the two. I do hope there is a 2nd movie though. I really enjoyed this film."
"brievc","7","3","6","21 October 2012"," Worth the watch if you appreciate Tim Burton
","Any time Tim Burton and Johnny Depp work together on a movie it's usually a recipe for entertainment. Dark Shadows is their latest collaboration in a long list of titles. Starting with Edward Scissorhands, and including titles such as Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Alice in Wonderland. Dark Shadows does not disappoint. It's a great dark comedy with several unexpected laughs and twists.<br/><br/>In Dark Shadows, Johnny Depp's character, Barnabas Collins, is a man from the mid-1700s. Barnabas comes from a wealthy fishing family that built their town named Collinsport. He is unfortunate enough to scorn a woman named Angelique; who just so happens to be a witch. Angelique kills his parents and true love after he refuses her. She then curses Barnabas; turning him into a vampire. Rallying the townspeople against him she has him chained in a coffin and buried alive. In 1972, nearly two hundred years later, he is accidentally unearthed by some unlucky construction workers. A series of mishaps and conflicts ensue as Barnabas tries to regain the Collins' family business, and restore their home. The entire family is still being plagued by Angelique after all these years; leaving the audience speculating as to what could happen next. Anything can happen when you take a trip in the twisted mind of Tim Burton.<br/><br/>The characters were well casted. Johnny Depp, as always, is very believable as Barnabas Collins. His quirky personality shows a wide range of emotions that truly brought Barnabas to life or death. There is a wide range of experienced supporting actors; including Michelle Pfeiffer. Her character, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, is the current head of the Collins' family. She is a strong woman with a dry; sarcastic wit. The cast was further enriched by Helena Bonham Carter as the hilarious drunken psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman, and Jackie Earle Haley, the Collins' confused, always intoxicated servant, Willie Loomis. As far as villains go, Eva Green was an excellent choice to portray Angelique Bouchard. Her facial expressions and mannerisms alone were worthy of any evil witch. The chemistry between the cast is undeniable, and adds to the charm and believability of the characters.<br/><br/>However, Dark Shadows is a comedy, and although there were several laugh out loud moments; it still left a little lacking in that department. The plot came across a little rushed in parts. More time was spent than necessary explaining things that were not key to the outcome, and not enough clarification on things that were. The ending was definitely more abrupt than expected. Mr. Burton could have gone into more detail with the final scene.<br/><br/>Overall, if you enjoyed Tim Burton's work on his previous films, Dark Shadows is a worthy addition to his collection, and deserves at least one viewing. It's entertaining and comedic with a great cast. The concept is different and not overplayed; as many films seem to be these days. Dark Shadows would make a great choice to watch when you are having a bad day. It's definitely better to watch with a friend, so you have someone to share in the madness and laughter."
"katejmwalker","7","3","6","20 October 2012"," Thoroughly enjoyable.
","Despite the scathing criticism that the movie received, I went ahead and watched it. I'm a lifelong Depp fan, and there's nothing like Burton's amazing style... what's the worst that could happen?<br/><br/>I actually thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a little queer, a little weird, a little spooky... and it was funny. It made me laugh, and it made me laugh again - which is common for Burton-Depp movies - they have a tang and feel to them that just works for me. So, I was expecting great things, and they delivered, magnificently. I haven't seen the Soap Opera, nor do I intend to - the movie said it all for me, and more. It was witty and quirky, and made me think about things I had thought about before, but in a different way, from another direction. I didn't find it over-the-top, or corny, though as another reviewer said, in parts, you could almost feel the mechanics behind the movements of some of the actors.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it well-written and directed for a movie based on a television show. It gave enough to explain what was happening and why, without leaving the watcher with the urge to watch the program for more information and explanation. I think it was well-casted - the children were cute and believable, and the 70's culture-shock that you got from some characters was exactly what I expected it'd be like. I wasn't disappointed, and though I wouldn't call it Depp or Burton's best work - I can say that I'd watch it again with enthusiasm."

","Now, I don't know the original series from Adam, but if it was anything like this steaming pile then I doubt it would ever have warranted enough of an interest to make it into a film.<br/><br/>For me it was a mix between a dark horror that never really scared and a comedy that never really made me laugh.<br/><br/>Yes there were deaths and blood but that by itself doesn't make something truly scary, and yes there were one liners that were clearly meant to be lighter moments but without timing or delivery they all fell rather flat.<br/><br/>This is a classic example of all the right individual elements never quite making a whole lot of anything.<br/><br/>I don't mean to say that I was unimpressed with it, I just mean that if it wasn't a treat for my girlfriend on her birthday I would have walked out of the cinema even before the credits finished rolling.<br/><br/>Lame, lame, lame, and anyone who gives this film more than half marks is either blindly in love with one of its stars or knows a member of the production crew and feels obligated to try and promote it even though they know deep down that it's a lemon and should have been a 'straight-to-DVD-movie'."
"jburtroald95","9","3","6","9 June 2012"," Well, I loved it!
","A swift, atmospheric prologue opens this immersive film version of the identically named 70s television series, where the legacy of the influential English Collins family is briefly introduced, and our impossibly likable hero Barnabas (Johnny Depp) is soon pushed to the forefront as the one who is to take up their great industrial and social mantle connected with their life-giving fishing company in America, their new place of settlement. Despite his noble intentions, his downfall begins with an unfortunate momentary fling with a pretty servant girl, Angelique (Eva Green) who he quickly draws away from when she hungrily takes the affair too seriously and starts demanding passionate declarations of love from him. The delicate Josette (promising newcomer Bella Heathcote) is his true love, but he remarks that of all lusty servant girls he had run afoul with a ferocious witch, who covertly kills her and his parents and imprisons him as a vampire in a shackled coffin as eternal punishment.<br/><br/>Although the romance is simplistically convincing, screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith knowingly glosses over this familiar narrative element and instead devotes his time to the twisted obsessive yet hate-filled sexual relationship between the hero and villain, and various symbols of superficiality, murder, betrayal, honour, monstrosity and oppression. As John August's story continues along an equally familiar route, in which Barnabas is inadvertently freed by construction work two centuries later, and must confront the miserable wreckage of the Collins' glorious mansion, family and business, these elements lift it beyond the usual fish-out-of-water comedy and give it raw significance.<br/><br/>Pleasingly to all of his fans, the latest feature from acclaimed experimentally and uncommonly imaginative – or ""weird"" to slothful critics – director Tim Burton is a very successful marriage of his closely held macabre, supernatural storytelling with the more widely popular character comedy genre. Much of the humour is blackened and maintains our sympathy with the loveably bumbling, old-fashioned Barnabas when his wretched curse compels him to devour innocent victims, and he resorts to hypnosis in his progress in assisting his struggling modern relations and warding off the persistent Angelique, who now heads a rival fishing company and continues to torpedo the Collins family in frustration.<br/><br/>Green is sensationally sinister and succulent as the complex femme fatale, and Depp delivers another indescribably perfect unique characterisation. I've purposely omitted details of the rest of the ensemble, because their introductions are much more gradual and imbedded into the narrative than those met during the speedy expositional opening, so enjoy the surprises in store. Among them are a few of Burton's talented group of old friends. Michelle Pfeiffer relishes another fantastical characterisation and makes a welcome return after her stunning turn as Catwoman in Batman Returns (1992). There's always room for a cameo from horror legend Christopher Lee, and he joins his good friend for the sixth time (he's provided the voice of his old, beloved Dracula for Frankenweenie, along with old hands Martin Landau, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder, which opens later this year). Burton's remarkably skilled wife, Helena Bonham Carter, joyfully joins her husband for a seventh time, even though her performance here might not be as effective as Depp's, as his Mad Hatter was against her Red Queen in Burton's last feature Alice in Wonderland (2010), her presence is still an asset to the picture, and fans will surely share in some inside jokes between her and the ultimate Burton regular, now on his eighth collaboration, after the quirky pair of muses co-star together for the fifth time. Combing through the credits, one can spot numerous other familiar faces in other departments, most notably his zany maestro Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is one of those rare mainstream films that practise their own morals. It never tries to command the feelings of the audience, a characteristic of its villain that it righteously condemns; any sadness is felt only in moments of genuine pathos, and the audience may choose which characters they rejoice with. Some, if desired, may simply and easily enjoy the slick farce at a comfortable distance, for, despite its budget, it is, at its core, a humbly brilliant film."

I am not sure if this was also shot in 3d (seen it in 2d), but it is stunning. The music is also well chosen and the score by Elfman is very good (somewhere along the way it reminded me of Williams score for TinTin). As for the story, there is actually a story in the movie (seems rare these days). And although it might be a bit slow, it is captivating. There are some nice twists and turns to keep things interesting, very well done. Depps character is not as over the top as for instance Jack Sparrow, but that fits the story well. And he is a vampire, so although you gain sympathy for him, he needs to do vampire stuff. Loved the Granny! The ending (without spoiling it), well, I felt like it could have been better and the twist/surprise in the end, I saw that coming (does not mean it is bad!! not at all).<br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable movie experience, go see it in the cinema.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the sequel!!"
"yucca111","8","3","6","17 May 2012"," Not Burton's best, but an attractive effort...
","Well perhaps Tim Burton has run out of ideas. Finally.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is the latest of a long line of Gothic and occasionally burlesque fantasies fried and seasoned by Burton and electrified into quasi-solid completion by Johnny Depp. I have always been fond of that two-headed monster, from Edward Scissorhands to Alice in Wonderland, though Burton-and-Depp have accumulated quite a bit of heat for the latter. Of course Burton deviates from original material in whatever he does. Washington Irving would never have known Sleepy Hollow for his, Roald Dahl might have blinked twice at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Lewis Carroll very possibly wouldn't callooh or callay at his revised (or should I say revisioned?) Wonderland. In this, Dark Shadows is no exception. There is a great divide between the 70's soap we know and love and Burton's over-the-top spectacle. However, what the film lacks in constancy and plot it more than makes up for in setting and character. <br/><br/>The film opens in eighteenth-century England. We watch the Collins family rise to wealth through a series of flashbacks before settling at last in aptly named Collinsport, New England. All would be fairytale perfect, were it not for young Barnabas's idle tryst with Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), an ambitious servant girl whose extracurricular activities consist mainly of reading spell tomes and summoning devils. Spurned by Barnabas, she wreaks havoc on the Collins family, concluding her revenge by cursing her former lover to all the soulless disadvantages of vampirism as well as the confines of a standard six-by-two.<br/><br/>There is no denying Burton is a master of set design. The first twenty minutes of Dark Shadows are sheer brilliance. A few moments that linger particularly in my memory are those featuring Barnabas before he becomes a vampire, mad with grief in the midst of Angelique's torments. The Collins estate is a beautiful work of Gothic architecture, ""the perfect marriage of European elegance and American enterprise,"" and Burton is at his best when the mansion itself is a character in mood and meaning. A claustrophobic library, closed and stifled to the light of day, where Barnabas fevers over occultism, contrasts desperation and entrapment with the melancholy sweetness we discover through Barnabas's one remaining happiness, Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote), on an open, grey little balcony, unadorned but simple and free. Poignant and effective, these scenes of shrouded mist and creeping, cloying evil set the mood for a film that might have been taut with suspense if not for two centuries lost and Barnabas' jarring introduction to the novelties of modern living.<br/><br/>Conflict in the film consists mainly of Barnabas's efforts to reestablish the Collins family business, all but flattened by Angel Bay Fishery. Yes, Angelique has indeed survived all these years to lord financial success and social influence over the ruined Collinses. While this storyline is somewhat lacking, the characters themselves provide an entertainment not dissimilar to the Addams Family's appeal. Of all the original characters, Elizabeth Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) maintains her mien of no-nonsense, but Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller) lacks the gravitas and charm of his original and is rather an ill-tempered skirt-chaser. The character of Carolyn suffers the most, the bubble-headed but innocent bombshell now transformed into a teenage rebel obsessed with, let's just say, not the Carpenters. As for Barnabas: well. Jonathan Frid defined the character with his shy yet aloof manner, a romantic ghost out of time and place. Depp handles the role with a similar romanticism and gentility, but there is a hint of villainy to his character that was not so defined in Frid, excepting House of Dark Shadows (1970). This Barnabas, while obsessed with thwarting the advances both physical and monetary of his nemesis Angelique, is also an active vampire, killing with a strange mix of remorse and glee. He executes mayhem with an apologetic relish that would mortify many a delicate modern vampire. Depp's excessive, perhaps rich, makeup and dress—exaggerated as in so many previous films— has never really upset me. I am rather fond of playacting, and the more extreme he waxes the easier it is for me to find a costuming parallel at Forever 21.<br/><br/>An outstanding performance worth mentioning is that of Bella Heathcote, who plays both Josette and Victoria Winters. Her performance is both sympathetic and emotionally charged, a blend of innocence and ethereal goodness that contrasts perfectly with Eva Green's portrayal of the devilish Angelique. Her intensity draws the viewer in and compels you to mostly forgive the occasionally awkward moments that take place at the Collins dinner table.<br/><br/>What you must not forget while watching Dark Shadows is that you are watching a Tim Burton film. Quirky, off-beat humor, eccentric characters, and moments of improbability are par for the course. There is too that theme of artistic misunderstanding caused by an unacceptable fascination for the otherworldly that pervades all of Burton's films. But if you are willing to suspend your disbelief and simply enjoy a bit of madness, mayhem, and Heaven for misfits, you will enjoy Dark Shadows despite its flaws, and perhaps more than it deserves for that careless bit of black adventure that carries through even the worst of Burton."
"jdesando","Null","3","6","17 May 2012"," Is it time to bury Burton/Depp?
","Camp piled on camp would be over the top for the best cinema satirists except maybe David Lynch and the durable Tim Burton. The latter has taken on the campy '70's TV program, Dark Shadows, enlisted his usual suspects, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, and made a comedy that holds up for laughs and wit, the latter being the province of the gifted Depp.<br/><br/>Depp's Barnabas Collins returning to Maine after sleeping for over 200 years, finds his dysfunctional family, well, still dysfunctional. His saving their fortune and indulging his enduring playboy inclinations, puts him fang to fang again with witch Angelique, played deliciously over the top by blonde barracuda, Eva Green.<br/><br/>Lurking in these shadows is Depp, who plays Collins with such uncharacteristic restraint that he captures his seductiveness and his menace in every turn of his smacking lips.<br/><br/>Burton and Depp have been together eight times starting in 1990 with Edward Scissorhands. Given the lack of financial success in Dark Shadows, it may be time to bury the relationship and resurrect it at a time when, like Collins, they can feed a nostalgic craze for them rather than noticeable box office yawns."
"matt-368-948075","5","3","6","14 May 2012"," Tim Burton shouldn't be an A-Lister anymore.....
","Johnny Depp's only mistake was making so many Pirates of the Caribbean films for - in each film he has done since - a little Captain Jack Sparrow appears. 'Dark Shadows' is no exception. For the most part Depp's portrayal as a vampire is brilliantly dark and it's nice to see a vampire film where the vampire hangs upside down, tears people apart, drinks copious amounts of blood and, more importantly, doesn't sparkle in the sunlight. The only problem with Depp's portrayal comes when the comedy comes into it - he then slips into a crossbreed character of a nasty vampire and a drunken Captain Jack. Not the worst of things, though, and he is still the best part of this film.<br/><br/>With regards to the film itself.... oh dear. It started off with a cracking intro giving us the backstory of the family's curse (nothing you haven't seen in the trailer) and it even had traces of Tim Burton's (recently lacking) brilliance too. Sadly, it even got my hopes up.<br/><br/>As the film went on - it went from plot-point to plot-point with little effort, the rest of the characters were hardly explored and seemed more one dimensional compared to Depp's own character - clearly given priority by the writer. Occasionally some nice humour was thrown into the mix (the advert hints at it being a comedy, it's not.... there are some dark, comic moments though) but my heart sank further (along with my respect of Tim Burton for allowing it) when they had a party in the mansion. I agree with the other review stating it was like a set-piece direct from Austin Powers. Worse was to come when the special appearance of Alice Cooper came in, for he was the parties rock group..... Really.... was the entirely necessary? Throwing someone in, such as Alice Cooper, just made the whole experience feel that little more cheesy and cheap.<br/><br/>Was the film entertaining? It was so-so. Just a further reminder that Tim Burton has either lost his touch or doesn't care now - instead relying on the pull of Depp. For let's be honest, at this stage, would a Burton film make as much money nowadays if it didn't have Depp in it? I fear he's losing his crowd.... I fear more that Burton could end up taking Depp down with him.<br/><br/>As for Helena Bonham Carter - again, she wasn't needed. If anything, her small role was probably just a token gesture to her, from her husband. She acted as though her heart weren't in it.... probably felt some jealousy towards Eva Green who played the evil witch (quite well but, again, her character wasn't really explored so - like other characters - it was hard to really care one way or the other about her).<br/><br/>So - a typical Burton film.... giving roles to his friends (Danny Elfman on music duties again) and his wife (quieter life at home and more cash for the couple, I guess)... to think - this man used to be a genius (Scissorhands, Beetlejuice)...."
"gregwendland","5","3","6","14 May 2012"," True Fans of the Original Series will be disappointed
","Watched this at the theater today. I'm not jumping up and down raving about it. My brother and I took our kids and our parents to see it for Mothers Day and I'm apparently the only member of the family that didn't like it.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows was originally a black and white soap opera that ran from 1966 - 1971. It was the forerunner for future ideas like Twilight. It was the first series to introduce Vampires, Ghosts, Werewolves, etc. <br/><br/>Being that Dark Shadows was intended as a Gothic drama, it seemed out of place since the movie attempted to portray the prequel to the series. Depp is popular for quirky, comedic roles, but I didn't feel it meshed well. That may be only because I've seen and enjoyed the original series, though.<br/><br/>The comedy bits were just that -- bits -- and unfortunately that didn't play well on the big screen. It almost seemed as if the makers of the movie couldn't decide whether to make a comedy or stay true to the drama. <br/><br/>Fans of the original series will most likely not appreciate this attempt, unless they are Johnny Depp fans. Hopefully, there won't be a sequel. To do so would only serve to finish trashing the legacy of the 1966 series.<br/><br/>On an objective note, it's a good family movie. If you know nothing about the original series, then you'd have no expectations and the movie would probably be better received. But, don't look for it to spend time on the subjects of vampires, ghosts, and werewolves. Except for the supernatural powers exhibited by the ""good"" and ""evil"" characters, you'd almost forget that it was about a vampire."

Here are couple of examples: 1- Who is David's mother, Why she could kill the witch? 2- Who is Dr. Julia Hoffman for the movie, at the end we see that she is still alive(kind of) so what?

","I wanted to like this movie as I am a Tim Burton fan but it was a boring film that was visually well made and well acted but lacked an interesting plot. the actors (especially Johnny Depp were fun to watch, as usual) but didn't have much to work with. It's almost as if there was a great idea for a plot and then everyone got caught up in the costumes, scenery and witty comments, leaving the plot to evolve through the scenes. I was bored about a fourth of the way in. The scenes where there were implied sexual encounters were pointless. I still don't understand being half in with sex. Either put it in and it's an adult movie and we can enjoy it, or leave it out. It doesn't work when it's half done. It's not cute or amusing. I rate a film on a lot of areas but the most important is ""would I see it again"" and I will not be watching this one again."
"CountVladDracula","7","6","16","13 May 2012"," Return to Collinwood
","My review of the Dark Shadows movie.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is the Gothic day time drama from 1966 in which most of the leading characters were supernatural beings. <br/><br/>First let's begin withthe bad about this movie.<br/><br/>I love bats. I love wolves. I miss vampires would take bat and wolf form in movies. It's gotten so bad that there are major news sites that mistakenly think Evil Ed of the original Fright Night is a werewolf despite all the evidence to the contrary because modern audiences can't wrap their mind around vampires taking wolf and bat form. Now on to Carolyn's secret. I had no problem with Carolyn being a werewolf but I do think her werewolf form could have looked a lot better. <br/><br/>The one joke I HATED was when Barnabas told Carolyn she should put her birthing hips to use lest her womb shrivel and die. It was a period based joke that didn't really work for me. It was a running gag that did not deserve to be one. It was old before it even started. Let it go. <br/><br/>There's also some questions of continuity and plot. In Dark Shadows there were a few such questions. After Barnabas was sealed away and his parents and ""one true love"" were dead where did the new Collins family come from? Were there other siblings or cousins of Barnabas they just forgot to mention? Granted the original show had similar plot holes.<br/><br/>How did Elizabeth not know her daughter had been a werewolf since a baby? I also noticed if you do the math they try to imply that Barnabas was very young when he became a vampire and I feel condescended to when they try to make him much younger just to appeal to a younger crowd, the man is almost fifty! Don't try to claim he's younger than forty. <br/><br/>Now for the good:<br/><br/>I LOVE Barnabas' vampire form. I like that he's a traditional, classic vampire. Like the actual 1897 Dracula novel he has the slightly pointed ears, the very white skin, the long fingers and sharp claw-like nails of Dracula himself. Some people had whined that he's too obviously a vampire but let's be realistic here, most people do NOT automatically assume someone is a real-life vampire. The more obvious choice would be that he suffers from a form of porphyria.<br/><br/>I loved when he slept upside down like a bat with his arms folded over himself. I loved his use of hypnosis and that he was easy to hypnotize. <br/><br/>The film Dark Shadows is not as much a comedy as the advertising would have you think,<br/><br/>I loved the aesthetic vision of the actual movie. It had great visuals. Collinwood itself looked fantastic. Widow's Hill is haunting. I absolutely adore the image of Josette's ghost. I miss ghosts looking like that, whispy, watery, translucent. Not things that look like jerky and spazzing video tape footage. <br/><br/>I loved the use of symbolism in the movie. I am fairly certain that Josette's ghost was not a ghost at all but actually the subconscious mind of Maggie Evans / Victoria Winters coming to the surface trying to reveal who she was in her past life and make her remember. I felt the ending of the film was exactly how Barnabas of the original TV show would have wanted Dark Shadows to end.<br/><br/>When Depp's Barnabas prattled on about the architecture and why he would not call Victoria by Vicky it was VERY true to the original Barnabas Collins.<br/><br/>I loved the melding of Robert Corbert's original Dark Shadow's TV scoring with Danny Elfman's own instrumental pieces.<br/><br/>I also loved the Alice Cooper songs, particularly the use of the Balad of Dwight Fry when Vicky's past iis revealed. Drwight Frye is a famous Classic horror movie actor who usually played insane henchmen, most famously Renfield in the 1931 Dracula. <br/><br/>I liked the small nod to the Paul Stoddard Plot during that scene because when Carolyn does the opening of the song ""Mommy, when's Daddy coming home? He's been gone for such a long time. I don't think he's ever coming home"" Elizabeth looks mortified. In the original show Elizabeth believed she had accidentally killed her husband.<br/><br/>A character I thought I would hate but actually ended up liking was Mrs. Johnson. She's just crazy! <br/><br/>I loved Christopher Lee's cameo.<br/><br/>The cameo of the original Dark Shadows actors showing up at the party was bitter sweet. You can tell Jonathan Frid was very frail. <br/><br/>I loved the ending. I felt what happened was Maggie / Vicky finally knowing who she truly was and embracing her past, the life that had truly been happy, the one with Barnabas. The ending was how I imagine Barnabas of the original TV show wanted Dark Shadows to end. I also loved that Dr. Julia Hoffman was trying to make herself into a vampire. I actually pitied her. <br/><br/>This wasn't just an adaptation of the original 1960s Dark Shadows. It was a hodgepodge of all previous incarnations of Dark Shadows with something new added and I appreciated it for what it was. Even the plot holes which I mentioned felt similar to plot holes you would find in the original series so it was surprisingly satisfying. This was a lovingly done homage, not a spoof, not a parody, a homage.<br/><br/>I give it 7.5 out of ten stars or 8 stars, depending on my mood. I have already watched the film twice and I will likely watch it again."
"jburkhard87","7","6","16","11 May 2012"," Not incredible, but solid
","I'm an avid fan of anything with the Burton-Depp-Carter trio, so when I saw something involving vampires I was stoked. I didn't know it was based on a TV series until a couple hours before I saw it, so I can't judge it based on that, only that I know Burton and Depp are both fans of the show.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt the movie was average for Burton, not one of his best, but solid. The effects were good, costumes were quite nice, and the set was very nice and they kept CGI to a minimum. People who have a gripe with the plot of the film seem to have wanted the film to pick a genre. I feel that the movie did a wonderful job using dark comedy, and that soap operas don't often stick with just one genre. As for sub-par acting, once again soap operas are incredibly melodramatic, and I would say acting in this is better than that.<br/><br/>My biggest issue was with some developments at the end of the movie that seemed a bit askew but all-in-all, I was entertained and enjoyed myself."

I disagree, it might not be great for a six year old but this is a mild pg13 film. Tim Burton is most definitely on a comeback with this flick.

","I wasn't expecting much since I used to watch the TV show back in the day. There wasn't much to it then, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be more of a drama and possibly bland. Not the case. First, I liked the way the story enfolded and how we got to know the characters one by one and how they worked in a group setting. Quite humorous and funny. I didn't expect that. Johnny Depp is great. He can play anyone or anything. He is so versatile and believable. He also has a comical side which added life to the movie. Eva Green, who played his nemesis was great. So believable. Very good actress and quite witty herself, too. If you grew up anywhere from the 60's to 90's, you will like the soundtrack. Great music. Appropriately placed in scenes. It's worth a night out and to be entertained. I liked it that much I may see it again on the big screen. I think it will have a better effect than watching it at home on a much, much, smaller screen and nowhere near the sound equipment the Cinemark theater has. Go see it with an open mind. If you're a Tim Burton fan then you will appreciate the film's direction, special effects and his dark humor. I can't wait till Frankenweenie comes out."

","When I was about to watch this movie, I expected a classic as its a Tim Burton movie and has an amazing cast(Johnny Depp, Eva Green and co). After I watched the movie I was full of disbelief because what I eventually saw was an average movie. Disappointing indeed.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. The movie starts well and it shows the evolution of the Collins Family(who are from Liverpool) and how they soon become a fishing business tycoon in America. Johnny Depp(Barnabus Collins) has a relationship with Angelique(Eva Green) and soon breaks her heart by having an affair with another woman named Josette. She then plans to curse the two of them and turns Johnny Depp into a Vampire and cremates him in a box. Barnabus then gets freed(after 196 years) by some people and sets fort to their Collinswood castle. How he manages to mingle with the existing Collins Family members and lifts the Collins Fishing Company is the rest of the story. He is confronted by Angelique again and seeks to avenge her.<br/><br/>The movie had plenty of cheesy lines and only few scenes make you laugh while others are just outright boring. The film also had plenty of over the top scenes that were unnecessary. The acting however was decent and Eva Green comes as a surprise package with her 'witch-eous' role. Johnny Depp was good. Chloe Moretz was annoying and so was Helena Bonham Carter in a few scenes. 'Dark Shadows' does not entertain either and its slow pace is quite relevant. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is an average movie and I still cannot believe that The ""Tim Burton-Johnny Depp"" duo failed to impress the audience. Don't expect miracles and watch it without expectations."

Recommended for all Depp and burton fans!!!<br/><br/>Films main plot: In 1760, the Collins family migrates to America from Liverpool and sets up a fishing port in Maine, naming it Collinsport. Sixteen years later in 1776 the son, Barnabas (Johnny Depp), has an affair with a maid, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), who is a witch infatuated with him since childhood. When he tells her he doesn't love or want her, Angelique kills his parents. Barnabas then falls in love with Josette du Pres (Bella Heathcote). In a fit of jealousy, Angelique bewitches Josette into leaping from a cliff to her death. Barnabas leaps after her in grief, but he survives because Angelique turns him into an immortal vampire. She rouses a mob to capture and bury Barnabas alive in a chained coffin in the woods and curses his family. One hundred ninety-six years later, in the year 1972, construction workers accidentally free Barnabas from his coffin, who reluctantly slakes his two-century thirst by feeding on and killing his rescuers"
"riantecrag","10","3","7","12 June 2012"," Funny, dark, great music (for the over 50s)
","I'll keep it short and sweet. This movie is both funny and dark, great lines and hearkens to other genres (think: 'Death Becomes Her'). An apologetic vampire? Sorry guys, ""you can't imagine how thirsty I was"". Mixing Depp's anachronistic English accent and attitude with 70's Americana is Catweezle himself (maybe only good for UK residents, that connection, perhaps). Very appropriate music of the time, and attitudes of the young then. The Alice Cooper vignette, and Depp's character's misunderstanding makes a good rolling gag. Yes, it a bit corny and some might say, predictable, but what do you want from a film. Look at the poster, it doesn't pretend to be heavy, serious. Good fun, will leave you smiling, go see."
"tosh-kelsey","1","3","7","4 June 2012"," I wouldn't recommend this movie for any family or anyone wanting a movie with family values.
","I didn't appreciate the fact that more than just a few minutes of this movie had inappropriate scenes or sexual innuendos. The story line was confused and I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a comedy, a romance, or just a random mix of characters and short little blips of a story line. The end of the movie got a little bit dark and rushed, like they were trying to finish and tie up loose ends. The story in general was a good one, but the details was where it got really weird. Although this movie has my favorite actor, Johnny Depp, it wasn't good. I would compare this movie to a dark romance mixed with an inappropriate comedy mixed with a fairy tale or legend. I don't think that the story was developed enough and there were too many different characters and bits of their lives all trying to be in the same 2 hours. Had the director taken out a couple of the smaller parts and developed further the more important parts, it could have been a decent movie. Overall, I wouldn't recommend going to this film, unless you have nothing better to do with 2 hours of your life."
"sanderhaugen","3","3","7","21 May 2012"," Mismatched Direction/Scripting/Vision
","IMO, this was not a good vehicle for Burton. I have to believe if Johnny Depp is a DS fan, he knows this did not hit the mark.<br/><br/>Burton (nor Grahame-Smith and August) did not seem to understand Dark Shadows or the characters and, the result was confused, disjointed, and overall quite disappointing.<br/><br/>Burton seems to have envisioned Barnabas as a 'sexier' Beetlejuice with fangs and treated the storyline, such as it was, as an inconvenient necessity. Not even Shakespeare could deliver a good script working with that.<br/><br/>I think Robert Zemeckis (Death Becomes Her) or even Barry Sonnenfeld (Adams Family) or Brad Silberling (Casper) could have done much better. Fortunately, we spent the next few days absorbed in an original DS marathon to clear our minds of the unpleasant experience."
"joeeyboy","5","3","7","19 May 2012"," I Just Don't Feel It Tim...
","When I first heard that Tim Burton would be directing 'Dark Shadows' I distinctly remember quite literally punching the air in delight! When the cast was announced for this film I was excited, finally a good vampire film and a good cast! Unfortunately 'Dark Shadows' lacks the 'oomph' that I thought Burton would surely provide...<br/><br/>It gets off to a bad start with the film instantly jumping into the action, barely leaving any time for the development of the characters. This I believe is what lets 'Dark Shadows' down the most. The cast was impressive but some of the people who I most was looking forward to seeing (Chloë Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter & Michelle Pfieffer) were severely underused! The film focused mainly on Johnny Depp and Eva Green's characters and their story lines instead of developing the other characters back stories! This ends up leaving the viewer bored and restless, waiting for the plot to thicken or the characters to actually do something.<br/><br/>While the film had a lot of downs it did also have its ups! Green did a magnificent job of portraying 'Angelique Bouchard' the cold, broken hearted witch with a bone to pick with Barnabas Collins (Depp). Pfieffer was excellent and was one of the strongest actors in 'Dark Shadows'. She managed to gel the cast together and provided a sense of humour and realism. Depp was a big let down, he could have done so much more with his character (Barnabas Collins) but unfortunately he just comes across as wooden. I had high hopes for Moretz - our latest rising star - but she just doesn't get enough screen time...<br/><br/>Overall 'Dark Shadows' was average. With barely any character development you feel as if there needed to be more to the story. There were a few shining stars and funny moments but I expected far better from Tim Burton... Better luck next time maybe?"
"TheShawshankErection","4","3","7","18 May 2012"," Not terrible... not all that great either
","Just got back from seeing this film and was highly disappointed. As an avid fan of Burton, Depp and Bonham Carter, I had high expectations for this film. Despite the unfavourable reviews, I refused to believe that Dark Shadows would be a bad film... while I wasn't entirely wrong, I wasn't completely right.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of the original series, so I don't know how faithful it is (although the general consensus is that it's a rough re-imagining rather than a new adaptation), but I was unimpressed with what I saw.<br/><br/>The movie had a weak opening, crammed with confusing history and topped with a dull, unimaginative opening title sequence. I kept expecting and hoping it to pick up pace and for the quality to improve, but sadly, it just didn't. The bulk of the film is a boring look at a dysfunctional family with a Gothic twist, and the whole fish-out-of-water premise quickly runs thin. The family in question is full of quirky, Burton- esque characters, but none are particularly engaging enough to make you care about what happens to them. The film's third act is a considerable step-up in the excitement levels, yet some unnecessary plot twists leave a foul taste, failing to save the film from ending up a muddled mess. There are a few genuinely creepy moments, and there's no doubt that several scenes will garner a laugh or two, but there's nothing wholly original or inspired on show here. The movie doesn't quite know what to do with itself; it's not quite a comedy, not quite a horror, not quite enough to be a horror-comedy. A lot of the story lines could and should have been left out, while most of the cast have little to do; there are far too many characters that are there purely for show. On top of this, a lot of the movie is just so weird and confusing that it is difficult to see why Burton made the choices he did - for people who are unfamiliar with the original series (probably most of modern audiences) a lot of the film would seem pointless and out of place.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has his moments as the dark hero (in fact, hero seems the wrong word; his character spends a vast majority of the movie slaughtering innocents. Yes, he is a vampire, and it's in his nature, but true vampires are not screen heroes, despite what modern society has spoon-fed us), but his performance is nothing we haven't seen from him before. There are some silver lining performances from the always- excellent Chloe Moretz, Jackie Earle Haley and HBC, but the majority of the cast (namely Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Lee Miller and co) seem to be on autopilot. Eva Green is beautiful and serviceable as the film's villain, while Bella Heathcote is awful and grossly miscast in her large role. There are also some awesome cameos from Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee. Aside from the huge amount of focus on Depp's Barnabus Collins and Green's Angelique Bouchard, the characterisation isn't great (although the pair share decent on-screen chemistry).<br/><br/>The direction is off-kilter, and I expected a lot more from Burton - it doesn't seem as if Tim Burton is directing as much as it seemed like it was another director trying to be Tim Burton. Danny Elfman's score is good, but takes a back seat to the great 70s soundtrack. A huge redeeming quality of the picture is that it looks gorgeous, thanks to great set production, costume design and cinematography. Lastly, the film's marketing campaign does it no favours - advertised as a family movie, the finished picture is surprisingly adult, crammed with a lot of innuendos, shocking jokes about teenage masturbation, a rampant love scene between Depp and Green, a lot of implied fellatio and surprisingly graphic violence. This is not one for the little ones.<br/><br/>All in all, I give the film 4/10. Dark Shadows is a perfectly serviceable flick, but gets weighed down by a lengthy running time, not enough action, horror or comedy to be classed as any genre, and an overall sense of mediocrity. It has its moments, but I'd expect a lot more from everybody involved. Watching this movie begs the question: ""what the hell was Burton thinking?"". It's not bad by any means, but by realistic standards, it is nothing more than a geek-out from Burton and Depp that leaves little to be enjoyed by the general movie-going audience. A damn shame."
"patsworld","5","3","7","17 May 2012"," What a Disappointment!
","Rather than 'how do I love thee', let's play 'how do I loathe thee'. This movie could have been so entertaining could have been a real tongue in cheek, hilarious take-off of Dark Shadows. I had anticipated such. Instead, it was witless, pointless, and worthless. Tim Burton obviously couldn't determine whether to go for funny or scary and as a result, it was neither. The premise of a movie was there, but it was pretty much there – and gone to the point of being invisible. The characters were without form and substance (in fact, all the female characters could well have been interchangeable, they were so look-alike and blah), the action rather meaningless. I'm thinking the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp had best go back to square one and start over again because once upon a time that combination was sure to result in something wonderful. That expectation was dashed and done in here. I almost dozed off several times and by the end of the film was rather disappointed that I hadn't allowed myself to do just that. At least I would have felt I'd gained some refreshing sleep from my time rather than ending up with a couple of wasted hours."

Well, Depp is awesome, no doubt about that. In fact, all the actors do a great job (Michelle Pfeiffer looks a bit like Kim Basinger in 8 Mile, doesn't she; and HB Carter is brilliant). But somehow there's is just a little too much stuff in this movie. Vampires, witches, werewolves, ... The usual and much-loved Burton antagonism of dark and shady and colorful and campy disappears behind all the action that is going on. Had I not seen and loved Sweeney Todd, Sleepy Hollow, and - of course - Edward, I would certainly review this one differently, but - as I said - comparing ""Dark Shadows"" with what I love Burton for, it's only okay. Watch it anyway. Alice Cooper's in it."

","I cannot believe all the negative reviews...this movie was funny, exciting plus a little dark - what more can you ask for? Depp was brilliant as always and Eva is the ultimate jilted witch. I found the extra exposition not only necessary but what I would expect if a great-great grandfather actually could come back and live in today's world. In-fact, I imagine someone from 200 years ago would not stop talking as everything they see is new and different. The set was beautifully executed and made the movie much more immersive. The weird teen (portrayed by Chloë Grace Moretz) was very believable - you would understand if you had a teen of your own. I liked the fact that this movie had some twists and wasn't stuck on a single plot (BORING)! I liked it so well I may go see it again before it comes to Redbox."
"ersinkdotcom","8","4","11","12 May 2012"," Good... but not as good as it should have been
","Is ""Dark Shadows"" as good as it should be? No, it isn't. A rather uninspired plot line and missed opportunities at really amping up the horror and supernatural scares keep the film from being an A-rated movie. It seemed like Burton was playing it safe. He wanted it to be supernatural and scary, but not so much as to frighten away average viewers and jeopardize his PG-13 rating. I was also surprised by the sexual situations in the film. There's a couple parts that went a little too far in my opinion.<br/><br/>Fans of ""Dark Shadows"" will no doubt like the film. They won't love it by any means. I don't think anyone will be offended by the campy humor thrown around. I found the movie to be an acceptable update of the original television series. It wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but entertaining nonetheless."
"davispittman","1","2","4","22 March 2016"," Umm.....
","Dark shadows is just absolutely terrible, it is muddled, BORING, poorly acted to be honest, and a complete waste of talent. Tim Burton is obviously a very talented actor, so I don't know what kinda whacked up stuff he was on when he did this movie, but even if he was that's still no excuse for delivering this trash to us. I'm not a humongous Depp fan, but he has been good in previous films, he was NOT in this one, he is annoying and way too over the top here. This film is not funny, when it tries to get out a laugh, it falls flat every time. Helena carter is lazy and lackluster here too. And I usually like Michelle Pfeiffer, but come on Michelle, you deserve better material than this! The events are boring and the plot i.e. uninteresting and the script is very lazy and phoned in. 1/10."
"Leofwine_draca","2","2","4","31 October 2015"," An odyssey of inanity
","Tim Burton must be the world's most unpredictable director. In the last ten years he's made what I consider to be his best movie - the exemplary SWEENEY TODD musical - as well as directing two stinkers which are the nadir of his career, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Unfortunately, DARK SHADOWS continues the latter trend, as this is his worst ever film, an odyssey of inanity from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Burton has always been a style-over-substance director and that's taken to the extreme here. DARK SHADOWS is ostensibly based on a classic '60s-era vampire TV soap opera, but what Burton has done is to take the basic premise and instead make his own version of THE ADDAMS FAMILY. You know, a family of kooks and weirdos, right up his street apparently. I sat watching this film and wondered just what exactly I was supposed to be thinking or feeling. The plot is tedious and long-winded and seems to go on forever. The film is a visual treat but there's no story, just a random connection of set-pieces. Some scenes, like the violent sex scene, are embarrassingly stupid. Was this supposed to be a comedy? There are some quirky moments, yes, but I have to say I didn't laugh once.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp delivers YET another of his kooky character performances and surely audiences must be bored of these by now. His vampiric lead is a complete bore, a collection of tics and weird behaviour that leads a vacuous hollow in the centre of the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is shoehorned into a storyline she doesn't belong in, just because she was Burton's wife, and Michelle Pfeiffer looks bored - who can blame her? Her role in STARDUST was a lot more fun. Poor Eva Green is the best actress in this thing, and her undeniable talents are wasted throughout. She deserves a lot better. The most embarrassing performance comes from the awful Chloe Grace Moretz - what were they thinking? - although I admit that the Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee cameos were nicely done. Overall, though, DARK SHADOWS is a hulking mess of a movie and one of the worst yet. Can Burton retire now, please?"
"starlimitz2","3","2","4","1 September 2015"," What did I just watch?
","A movie that lacked so much direction that the original plot doesn't enter into until the last 2 minutes of the film. Tim Burton apparently had ideas for about seven other movies that wouldn't work on their own. He crams all of those ideas into this one movie, where they don't work anyway. In this film, once there is a plot point of any kind, it is either not discussed for 1/3rd of the movie, or it is immediately resolved that very scene, then we move on to yet another one. This movie has absolutely no focus what-so-ever. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, horror, drama, or romance, so it decides to be one of those every other scene and it is just exhausting. <br/><br/>The Bella Heathcote is in the film for a total of five scenes of the movie, and she is in the first few scenes of the movie as the main focal point. Johnny Depp is the focal point for the majority of the film, and decides that he loves her for no other reason than meeting her once, and walking with her on the beach once. This movie has no build up on any front, and decides to hit it out of the park without even battering up. <br/><br/>Dark Shadows has no audience. It's one thing to reach a demographic, but be good enough for others, but it's another thing to reach absolutely no audience at all because of how vague the plot is, and how childish/adult oriented the movie turns out to be. <br/><br/>There are some genuinely funny moments, and the movie has shown promise more than once through out, but these moments of glee are interrupted by large portions of sporadic jumps across the screen. There are times when we truly feel for Johnny Depp's character, and his overacting is actually humanizing to a degree of someone who was a fish out of water or a man out of his own time. Yet he still murders innocent people and handles his problems so blatantly bad that the sympathy for him is limited down to nearly nothing. <br/><br/>It's a mystery of how Tim Burton wanted to play this film out in the first place. He obviously had some good ideas, but every single idea that is brought to the screen is soon wiped off in order for another to take its place. Then there comes the third act, where we are treated to the most uncalled-for horror-fest money can buy. Remember when I said there was no build up to this movie? The third act was the prime example. All of the sudden we are shown things that had absolutely no build up to it anywhere throughout the film. They are just brought to the screen and we are supposed to accept them, and after being beaten with so many random plot points, you feel like you've ran a marathon, and the movie ends with very little to recollect.<br/><br/>This film is not worth the time nor the effort to attempt to watch. It paints an obvious picture of how hard times have fell on a formerly great director, and why it may be time for him to hang up his director's chair for good. Do not give this film the time of day unless you are just such a die-hard Johnny Depp fan that you want to see everything of his in the first place. Either way, you have been warned."
"Gracelovesmovies","1","2","4","27 September 2014"," Tim Burton has lost his touch
","I adore Tim Burton's movies in general. Corpse Bride, Big Fish and Beetlejuice are among my favourite movies. <br/><br/>However, I can't help but feel that over the past few years Tim Burton has either lost the plot or his magical touch. Watching ""Batman Returns"" in television yesterday cemented this thought for me. Michelle Pfeiffer must sincerely regret asking to star in Dark Shadows, probably a decision she made because her collaboration with him as Catwoman was so amazing.<br/><br/>Alice in Wonderland was a convoluted mess which gave me a headache, although it did get better after I watched it a second time. At least Johnny Depp wasn't terrible in it. However, he completely over-acted his leading role in Dark Shadows, and the movie lacked any form of wit or humour at all. As some other people noted, Chloe Grace Moretz was also incredibly irritating in this movie.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this movie, if any, is the eye candy of Tim Burton's more or less always beautiful sets. To be fair, Eva Green wasn't that bad either, and is sexy is always. Depp's love interest in the movie also looks simply transcendent with her blonde hair when playing her part as a ghost.<br/><br/>The movie had so much potential, and it was such a letdown. (And I never even watched the original TV series so it's not like I dislike this movie based on comparison) I hope that Tim Burton gets his talent back somehow and produces touching films like the Nightmare Before Christmas or funny films like Mars Attacks once again. I would love to see him do justice to the Addams Family, if that were possible."
"TheSaraheverett","3","2","4","23 June 2014"," Um Alice, this isn't your movie.
","I do not doubt the skills of Tim Burton nor his cast of characters, nevertheless I found this film to be very underwhelming. In his normal fashion, Johnny Depp pulled off another semi-creepy but lovable performance that somehow made this film a bit more bearable. The plot was very simplistic in design and a bit too underdeveloped to carry much weight. The other actors were good enough, but they were not important to the basic story. Only Johnny Depp was. As he always is. The jokes were stupid and felt as though they were lacking in the kind of taste normally associated with such films. The worst of it though was that the main character played by Depp, Barnabas Collins, was excused for his behavior as a vampire. It was OK that he was killing people left and right out of thirst. It wasn't frowned upon by the other characters, nor discouraged by the narrative. Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I think it's a bit rude to go around sucking people's blood when you are thirsty. But that's just me apparently. There were also several appearances that didn't make sense in the film. Like Alice Cooper. Why was he there? Overall, this film was a bit confusing and disappointing in it's presentation. It could have been a comedic view of vampires if it didn't try so hard to be funny and dark at the same time. Sorry Tim, better luck next time. As a disclaimer, I've never really been a fan of his anyway."
"aciessi","3","2","4","29 December 2013"," Pretension Only Goes So Far
","Dark Shadows tries with all its might to be as quirky, spooky and ironic as possible. But I couldn't agree more with what most of the critics have said, and I quote, ""All dressed up, and nowhere to go"". To be honest, I thought that this was going to be one of Burton's most original outings since the mid-nineties. I was looking forward to the juxtaposition of groovy nostalgia and Universal classic horror movie monsters that this film promised. But once I pressed play, those hopes were quickly dashed. Its another pretentious Burton schlock-fest with over the top weirdness, over bearing set pieces, uninteresting dialog and of course, Johnny Depp stinking up the joint. I should have known that Dark Shadows was such an appealing franchise for Burton to get his greasy hands on. Nothing in this film is genuinely compelling or funny. However, the homages to the 70's (as little in quantity as they were), were at least semi- amusing. Tim needs to learn at some point or another that his 20 year Depp collabo is wearing extremely thin. Perhaps the film's box-office returns gave some sort of a clue."

The end doesn't make any sense at all and seems completely rushed.<br/><br/>Seeing Johnny Depp as yet again another make-up-overloaded ""weirdo character"" gets boring by now as well and all of the other actors except for Eva Green seem to not give it their best at all.

I think that was one of the reasons this movie didn't do well. That and people thought Tim Burton/Johnny Depp's schtick was getting tiresome. Their thoughts were ""Not ANOTHER Burton/Depp movie!""<br/><br/>The plot is the typical fish out of water story that has been done a million times. Barnabas doesn't know what a car is, or a TV is, or why isn't anything like the century he lives in now. It's such a big cliché.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp just plays the same weirdo he always does. He always has that curious, innocent look on his face. The frown and the widen eyes.<br/><br/>Aside from Depp, Burton has to cast Helena and Christopher Lee AGAIN!<br/><br/>Don't you hate it when directors cast the same actors over and over and over? It's like when Wes Anderson always casts Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson again and again.<br/><br/>The cinematography is awful. Ever since Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton always has his movies out of focus and pale. It's like if you were taking a picture on your camera and turned the focus off. And characters with white faces are another Burton cliché.<br/><br/>The whole thing about Carolyn turning into werewolf at the end is never explained. This movie is just lazy and doesn't bother telling you anything.<br/><br/>When Barnabas bites Victoria at the end and says ""My curse has been lifted."" How? You're still a vampire. But who cares?

We saw in awful Sweeney Todd. We saw Helena Bonham Carter and we know already how bad she is. Any clear spot? Pfeiffer? Nay, she is very much like in Stardust. Old hat. So, any clear spot? Yeah. Alice Cooper. Music. This is all. All that dark, sepia, gloomy scheme is so funny and laughable. We never even smile. We saw all those mannerisms before.

"pincushion-581-874440","4","2","4","25 January 2013"," soulless film
","Tim Burton managed to leave me totally void of any emotion through the entirety of this movie. I didn't like it or dislike it, just totally middle of the road. It looked real nice as Burton has a flair for the Gothic but it was as if he just didn't care about the material enough. Frankenweenie is testament that when the work is personal he can produce wonderful idea's and marry them to film with ease. Nobody springs to life and aesthetically the film looks decent but without the small details that set his notable works apart.<br/><br/>There is no firm plot. The family have money troubles, Depp turns up and reveals a hidden treasure room. Money troubles gone. Seriously, that quick. The movie avoids any real interesting plot devices such as the recent string of killings upon Depps return. Or the story of the boy who can apparently see his dead mother. How about the secret around Moretz troubled teen, no we'll just address those in the last five minutes. The love interest also has a back story summed up in a matter of moments. The tumultuous relationship between Depp and Green opens this movie and delivers for the small part. Overall though it plays out exactly as you would expect. You'll be left wondering why the manner in which they deal with the witch didn't just happen right off the bat.<br/><br/>Considering the eclectic talent filled cast you'd think there would at least be some interesting performances. There isn't. All actors deliver the bare minimum, totally due to the script issues. This just leaves the meat for Depp and Green. Green just mails it in and Depp plays his role like Jack Sparrow dressed for Halloween.<br/><br/>I will never watch this again."

On the other hand I also didn't found it a typical Tim Burton flick.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is really looking great as Barnabas Collins, his stiff and on the other hand funny. There are a few good horror moments but in fact it's more about the comedy and situations. Not that it was bad at all. The original cast of Dark Shadows do appear at the party, sadly Jonathan Frid (the original Barnabas) died shortly after. What was funny was that we do have a gig of Alice Cooper in his clothes from the seventies. I liked that part a lot. I also liked the performance of Eva Green (Angelique Bouchard) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) wasn't that bad neither. <br/><br/>Still it's not my favorite Tim Burton flick but I enjoyed it as a starter of a horror night.

"anettsgk","6","2","4","31 December 2012"," It's OK ...
","The film itself was alright, but there was something missing from it. The visuals and directing were great; the plot was interesting, but the one thing that failed to deliver was, unfortunately, something that would have been the difference between this film being OK and going up to good.<br/><br/>The script was pretty bad.<br/><br/>There is no other way of putting it. While there were some good lines for the main characters, not enough time and attention is given to the lesser characters, for example the moment when the moody Carolyn Stoddard is randomly revealed to be a werewolf. If you want to do that, fine, but then at least drop even the most subtle hints so that the revelation is less, ""Um ... WHAT?!"" and more, ""I KNEW it!"" A deleted scene can be found on YouTube, however, a conversation between Carolyn and Victoria which, although short, heavily implies Carolyn's nature. A grave mistake was made in not including that in the film. Because of this brief conversation being cut out, I got the impression that the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in for the audience to oooh and aaah.<br/><br/>On the subject of characters, the casting is superb. Johnny Depp is the culture-shocked, cursed vampire, who at the end of the day is the only one producing the few laughs. Michelle Pfeiffer, in the role of Elizabeth, is both stern but strong. Helena Bonham Carter is the wonderfully quirky Julia Hoffman. Eva Green clearly relishes playing the villain, Angelique. Chloë Grace Moretz, who we all know is an amazing actress, does her best as the angsty werewolf Carolyn but sadly her limited lines mean that she is not challenged and we don't see the full extent of her acting ability.<br/><br/>The weakness of the film wasn't down to the direction, the visuals or the cast, but to the script, which was decidedly flat about 90% of the time. Maybe if Tim Burton had a writer who could actually write, the film would have been better. <br/><br/>All in all, this film was by no means bad, but it isn't one that many will squeal about in excitement. The cast did their best with the lines they were given. A shame, then, that ""Dark Shadows"" will be among those average films that are quickly forgotten."
"lathe-of-heaven","8","2","4","27 December 2012"," I went into this really not expecting much, but... Surprisingly, it was actually quite good. Blu-ray: Excellent A:10 V:10
","I was REALLY surprised by how much I liked this film! I almost didn't watch it because I read so many reviews where they said that Burton took the old Gothic show and made it REAL campy. But, that simply is not true. So, I had pretty much resigned myself to the fact that the movie, although possibly entertaining, was probably not going to have much of a truly Gothic atmosphere and that it was likely going to be pretty corny.<br/><br/>Well... I am FRIGG'N glad that I did see it! I do not really care for a lot of Tim Burton's films, but I very much DO like a few of them. So, I was VERY pleasantly surprised that right from the start the film had a STRONG Gothic intensity that Burton retained through most of the movie. And... the comedy when it did come, was timed very well and it really was used fairly sparingly. Most of it shows up around the time when Barnabas comes back and the expected humorous things that happen to him when he tries to interact with 200 years in his future. This time, I did NOT get the impression that it was a run-of-the-mill Tim Burton film, where he was just kinda going through the motions. I could truly feel his heart solidly in this one, really bringing out the depth of feeling inside of Barnabas, and thus, our feelings for him.<br/><br/>Amazingly, Burton kept the tension and main focus on the underlying enmity between the two primary characters most of the time. And Depp's performance was absolutely perfect! He hit JUST the right amount of dryness when reacting to 'modern day' things; and he kept up a consistent, beautiful, dark, Gothic pathos which carried most of the film. I mean, you could REALLY relate to and feel for him, despite the eccentricity of the character; you have to be EXTREMELY good in order to be able to pull that off.<br/><br/>So, whether you are a Tim Burton Hater or not, please by all means give this movie a chance (assuming you like at least SOME fantasy elements in your films) You may be VERY surprised (as I was) that it is actually quite good and likely one of Burton's better movies..."
"axsun19","9","2","4","10 November 2012"," Barnabus Collins scorns a witch who loves him and she turns him into a vampire and destroys his family's fortune. He returns 200 years later to revitalize it all.
","I really do not understand why this movie is getting such a bad reputation.<br/><br/>My theory is that people were expecting something that this film was not: they wanted it to be true film adaptation to the original soap opera source material, they wanted to see Nightmare Before Christmas 2, they wanted a dark horror movie, they wanted a hilarious fantasy comedy, or maybe they expected Batman Returns Again.<br/><br/>If you watch this film with ANY expectations like the above, then you will be sorely disappointed. That is not to say that this film is bad because I actually love this film and think it's very, very good.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is really at the top of his directing game here because this movie is actually a blend of silly comedy, dark fantasy, 70's period piece, and revenge. These are drastically different genres but Burton sews them together very smoothly. One scene will have Barnabus trying to ""fit in"" to the 70's with silly results, and the next will be a blood- sucking murder of one of the characters. This movie has ghosts, vampires, werewolves, witches, and somehow they all cohesively fit together without trying to kill each other for attention for the audience.<br/><br/>You can also tell that the script has been polished and fine-tuned to a brilliant level. I never once got tired of action or tired of the drama because Burton and his writers spaced things out and paced the movie very well. You never feel rushed to the end of the movie or dragged slowly through the mud; this film changes the pace accordingly to the ultimate climax at the end.<br/><br/>Of course none of this would work out if you didn't believe in the film's main character Barnabus Collins. Johnny Depp anchors this film with his truly amazing acting. If you reread his lines in this movie, you will know that a lesser actor will have audiences laughing at the ridiculousness of his words. I always thought Depp was good in general, but I am not a huge obsessive Depp fan. But he deserves high praise here because you can tell he takes his craft very seriously and it pays off. Depp plays Barnabus very straight-faced with no theatrical ""wink"" to the audience; he reads his lines as if he really were an 18th century merchant who turned into a vampire and has resurrected in 1972. <br/><br/>Equally important in this acting category is Eva Green, who plays Barnabus' former lover and the witch who turned him. Her character is more ""out there"" in terms of villains and she needed to act with the appropriate grandiose bad guy and obsessive-ex-girlfriend levels at the same time. She is fantastic here because she shows vulnerability as an ex who wants Barnabus back but also a cut-throat businesswoman out to destroy him. Oh yeah, I forgot she also has to play a villainous witch on top of those two qualities. She shines and plays a great counterpart to Depp.<br/><br/>In this movie, I found myself laughing, curious, and creeped out at the various times. I also came into this movie expecting nothing more than to be entertained, and it delivered more than that. I know Burton has a history of doing certain types of movies, but please don't go in expecting this and that. You have very polished and solid writing, very good acting, and silly comedic reliefs throughout the film. Just open your minds and go on a fun ride because this movie will surely keep you entertained if you don't label it beforehand."

The set up and intro was great, but after that it went downhill. <br/><br/>First, Barnabus builds his home with his family then it shows him falling in love with Josette then he's kissing another girl (Angelique) he doesn't love who then banishes him and turns him into a vampire because of it. Then he shows up in 1972 and meets his descendants. Then it shows Angelique again and it shows what she's doing. Then its back to Barnabus and how he needs to get back at Angelique. Then it shows him doing random unrelated things to the focus of the movie. Then it's back to Angelique and him having sex (Who knows why) Oh! Did I mention there's another love interest in this? Just what we need to make this even MORE confusing. Its Julia winters who resembles Josette. It shows her and barnubus falling in love.

","Today I'm not going to say what I normally do, describe the story. So I'm getting right into it.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a mediocre film. It's not good, but not bad. The things it achieves in it's cinematography and music selection, though the acting is good but cliché and doesn't bring the sense of fear and dis functionalism that was in the television series. <br/><br/>The film has no fear or dis functionalism at all. However Johnny Depp starts out well but then goes back to his everyday film antics, with the weird looks, the annoying accent that sounds as if he has something in his throat. Johnny Depp in this film as the title, I think, was a bad mistake. You cannot take him seriously in this film as the vampire.<br/><br/>In a film about a dysfunctional family, it feels quite dull, boring and well... weird.<br/><br/>I think the director Tim Burton and screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith tried to go for the spooky, atmospheric type of film. It didn't quite work. It's more like one of those over the top comedies that aren't funny. The thing about this film that I thought was a really bad mistake, the makers tried to hard on the film. A quick start, a weird non understandable ending, and a mediocre film.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I did enjoy the film, and I really tried to like it. But it's hard to say it's good. It's just another cliché mediocre recreation of an amazing television series/book/movie. The closest to this, I would think, would be Little Fockers, except that was worse.<br/><br/>I'm sorry but I'm giving this 2 and a half golden movie reels out of 5"

","It wouldn't be hard to argue that Tim Burton has lost some of his magic in the last few years. Granted his bank account has grown considerable in this period especially since Alice in Wonderland. It seemed that financial wealth had paved the way to creative bankruptcy. Films like Charlie and the Chocolate factory and Planet of the Apes had shown that the Director was less willing to take a chance instead trying to adapt his ""quirkiness"""" to already established properties. Trailers for Dark Shadows provided hope of the director's return to form showing hints of both Beatle juice and Edward scissor hands. Sadly after watching the finished project Tim Burton fans may have to wait a bit longer for this return to form.<br/><br/>Opening in 1760, Johnny Depp plays Barnabas, a well to playboy and local man about town. When he breaks the heart of the beautiful Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) little does he realize that she is a witch and that his decision will cost the life of his true love Josette(Bella Heathcote) as well has cursing him to spend all eternity has a vampire. When the townspeople get wind of this curse they quickly bury him alive. Barnabas remains buried for two hundred years only to be resurrected in the year 1972. He decides to return to his beloved Collinwood Manor where he is taken in by the remaining members of his family. Little does he realize that Angelique is also immortal and she is none too pleased when she discovers her old ""flame"" is back on the scene.<br/><br/>From the above synopsis you can probably guess that Dark Shadows is a strange little picture. Tim Burton must be commended in a way for being able to use his clout to bring a picture like this to screen. Based on a short running soap from the late 60's Dark Shadows is a mix of comedy, horror, drama and satire. Where the film falls down is in its attempt to juggle all of these different tones together. First time writer Seth Grahame-Smith screenplay seems unable to sit down and decide what kind of film it wants to be. It seems to stumble from scene to scene shifting from violence to comedy. Upon awaking after 200 years Barnabas violently kills five people only to quickly follow it with a joke about the Mac Donald's. It's all a bit surreal and has the film continues you try to figure out who this film could possibly have been made for. It's too violent for children but to childish for adults. Dialogue scenes have the feel of a soap or melodrama but all this does is add a jarring sense to what is unfolding on screen. It is hard to believe that there is only two credited screen writers has it feels like the work of several different people.<br/><br/>The members of the Collins family themselves are each poorly crafted. Each character is introduced only to be dropped shortly after. Johnny lee Miller and Chloe Moretz are reduced to walk on parts for most of the running time. Michelle Pfeiffer fares a little better but isn't given much to do for all the screen time she gets. The less side about Bella Heathcote the better. Her performance is fine but after she is introduced you get the feeling that most of her performance ended up on the cutting room floor. She is supposedly the love of Barnabas's life but she spends very little screen time with him. This only takes away any emotion from the climax because despite what is said throughout these two characters feel like complete strangers. All that leaves is the two stars of the show, Johnny Depp is his usual watchable self and he does well to keep his character likable given all the unlikable things he is asked to do. Eva Green is over the top and incredible psychotic has the lethal witch who refuses to accept the Barnabus will ever love her.<br/><br/>The film is not without its positives. The look is fantastic and the attention to detail for the 70's setting is inspired. The texture of the decade is captured perfectly and it acts as a perfect counterpoint to Barnabus 18th century lifestyle. The soundtrack is outstanding with songs from T-Rex, the Moody Blues, Elton John and Alice Copper who makes a brief cameo in the picture. There is some humor to be had thought out and it's nice that the fish out of water scenario isn't used solely has a punch line unlike another big summer release Men in Black 3.<br/><br/>Technically the film is top notch, it looks great it sounds great but most viewers won't feel too great after watching it. A botched and strange misfire from Tim Burton that is almost fascinating in how much of a mess it is. It is guaranteed to be unlike any other big summer release you have seen in a long time, it's just a shame that the end product never quite becomes what it could have been. By the time the 3rd act showdown kicks into gear viewers will be left cold by what's unfolding in front of them. What you a left with is a handsome looking imaginative misfire that will quickly be forgotten by all but the hard core Burton fans."

","Just saw the film, and contrary to most the of critics, I found the film entertaining, meaningful and quite hilarious. <br/><br/>Some people seems to complain Mr. Tim Barton lost his magic compared to Beetlejuice, Batman, etc., but instead I find Mr. Barton has moved to somewhat more emotional film. <br/><br/>I like the films was about family bounds, and at the end how everything is tide up altogether.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is rather slow, but I like it that way, instead of making it super fast like a video clip. I did enjoy Mr. Deep as always, he brings his classical witty caricature on scene. I also appreciated the rather quiet, minimalistic sense of humor of the film."
"DarthVoorhees","8","2","4","4 October 2012"," A chess game between Burton's flaws and strengths as a filmmaker.
","I actually really enjoyed 'Dark Shadows' to my surprise. I often find it hard to review a Burton film. I am a huge fan of the visual and aesthetic style he's perfected and trademarked over the years as I'm sure a great many people are and yet despite this he has tremendous flaws as a storyteller. None of Burton's films save his masterpiece 'Ed Wood' have a story with characters. They all remind me of modern day hybrids of silent German expressionism but rather than delve into a wide range of themes and emotions Burton's films always punctuate the same note every time. 'Dark Shadows' falls into the same set up as all of Burton's films, the quirky loner trying to integrate into a society that is completely foreign to him. I think though that being a comedy and camp film tremendously help 'Dark Shadows' make this Burton formula fresh again. Generally, I am one that thinks Burton's comedies are much stronger than his straight efforts. Burton realizes this distorted Barnabas Collins can only be played for laughs and it works. This movie is very funny and Depp creates one of the most relatable Burton characters in years.<br/><br/>I will begin this review by saying that I am not familiar with the original 'Dark Shadows' soap opera and so I can't really give a fair estimation as to whether or not it is a fair adaptation. I do however think that Burton is not someone to go to if you want a faithful adaptation of a previously released source material. All of Burton's adaptations became reflections of himself and many of them bear little to no resemblance to the original material. I like elements of 'Batman' and 'Batman Returns' even though both films are horrific adaptations of the comics. Surprisingly though I felt as though Burton really tried to squeeze a great deal of exposition into this film, far more than one usually gets from a Tim Burton film. The first seven or eight minutes of the film is a long monologue by Depp's Collins giving the back story of the universe. When the film hits these moments it grinds to a screeching halt in an otherwise briskly paced film. I was quite surprised to really see this with Burton and I think he probably should have trimmed some of these scenes as his filmmaking strengths all really have to do with mood and yet I admire that effort was placed into giving depth to the characters. I think exposition could have been given as a result of action. This is probably one of Burton's most developed stories and yet it is still lacking. It's a worthy try though. <br/><br/>The ultimate success of the film stems from it's really well cast and performed ensemble. I gave up on Burton for a while because I was growing tremendously tired of his constant casting of Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, who generally I greatly enjoy. I just get the feeling that they cannot say no to one another. This film does not blindly place them in their roles however. Both of these characters greatly play into their strengths. I loved Carter as Dr. Julia Hoffman who plays as a goth freaked out version of her character Marla from 'Fight Club'. Depp is very funny here as Barnabas Collins because the joke is he has so much dignity and he can't really do anything with it. Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earle Haley, Chole Moretz all have a great deal of fun with their roles. Eva Green goes into violent extremities as Angelique but this is a Burton film after all. <br/><br/>None of these characters are particularly rounded or fleshed out but they are interesting types. I suppose Burton's films always deal with caricatures but caricatures can be interesting if talented and driven actors find their intricacies and do fun things with them. I didn't really emotionally invest myself in Barnabas Collin's plight but I was entertained by Depp's performance because of it's energy and playfulness. <br/><br/>This is a Tim Burton film to the core. I've seen Tim Burton's films and I like a lot of what they do but he is a flawed filmmaker. I think 'Dark Shadows' with it's beautiful sets, seventies music, quirky performances, more detailed story and goofiness has enough to really make me look past Burton's flaws and admire his strengths."

","Barnabas Collins is a vampire cursed by a witch who is love and, unfortunately for him, Barnabas does not return her love. He is left in a casket for more than a century and when released, he finds that he has landed in the year 1972. Johnny Depp can play almost any role that is thrown his way. A pirate, a hatter, and a vampire. The latter is shown here and it is interesting and amusing to see him play a vampire from the 1700s. Tim Burton's macabre and creepy humor comes out throughout, with Johnny Depp definitely helping with that. It is also considerably dark and while trying to maintain the comedy over the course of almost two hours, the movie has its ups and down. The sexual content is a bit much as well and would have been perfectly fine without it. However, I enjoyed it because you develop feelings for the characters and it certainly does grab you and make you want to learn how it all turns out. ""Dark Shadows"" is also a perfect Halloween movie."

","This live action cartoon starts off really fast and furious with what seems like a great story, but then out of no where, it starts to lose steam and ends up spinning its wheels, much to my frustration, as this was the only movie running on the Red Eye from Los Angeles to Boston. There are lots of predictable scenes and lines that attempt to be cute or funny (much like Burton's goofy Planet of the Apes remake) but this just emphasis the inability of the writer and director to connect with fans of the series. Even Depp seems like he's just coasting along for a paycheck. Elfman's score is creepy enough, but as the film morphs into a Scooby Doo episode, so does the music. Hence, the mansion is the real star. Eva Green is gorgeous as ever and if it weren't for her, I'd have just snoozed on the plane ride home instead of waiting and waiting for the story to improve. Neither the story nor my patience did. The most obnoxious gig with this film is Depp's makeup. Even vampire's don't look this clownish or silly. If you're 12 or 13 and a real die-hard Depp - or Burton fan (if there is such a thing) you might get through this film, but I recommend passing on this one and go back to the original TV series on DVD."
"paul_haakonsen","7","2","4","2 September 2012"," A great movie in itself...
","I remember watching the 1991 series and was quite fond of it, especially because of the acting by Ben Cross and Lysette Anthony, and it had a really interesting plot. So I was really curious to see how the concept would fare under Tim Burtons dark, twisted, surreal touch. Don't get me wrong, I am big fan of Burton and enjoy most of his previous work.<br/><br/>I will say that you should not hold the 1991 series up against this 2012 movie version, that is sort of a mistake. I haven't seen the 1966 running series, so I can't compare anything to that. Where as the 1991 series was more Gothic dark romance, this 2012 movie does have that, but adds some of Burtons dark humor as well, which most of the times does work out well enough. Just don't do what I did, and draw similarities between the two.<br/><br/>If you just watch the 2012 movie as a stand-alone movie, it is actually good entertainment. It has a great story that doesn't really require a lot of thinking on the viewer's part. It is just sit back and enjoy the movie. But what amazed me in it, as with most of Burton's work, is the level of details in everything. The Collin's mansion for example, wow, it was just off the charts. It had such a great wonderful touch to it, dark and mysterious, yet grand and ancestral at the same time.<br/><br/>As with the classic Burton movie, you have Johnny Depp (playing Barnabas Collins) and Helena Bonham Carter (playing Dr. Julia Hoffman) in it, and as always they deliver a great performance, both individually and together on the screen. But ""Dark Shadows"" also boasts other impressive names, Michelle Pfeiffer (playing Elizabeth Collins Stoddard), Jackie Earle Haley (playing Willie Loomis), Chloë Grace Moretz (playing Carolyn Stoddard), and also two great appearances by Christopher Lee (playing Clarney) and Alice Cooper (as himself, just in a 1972 version!).<br/><br/>Personally I found the comedy in the movie a little bit misplaced, because I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to laugh or take it seriously. (I didn't laugh, though!) I will say that without the comedy, the movie would have fared a bit better than it did. Perhaps I just didn't appreciate the comedy in a movie of this genre and caliber, but who knows, you might just enjoy it and find it funny.<br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" is definitely a great movie to watch, it is entertaining and interesting, and it doesn't really put vampires up as teenage idols with sparkly skin and big hair - so it is a great step back to the original charismatic and devilish creatures that vampires should be. And it is a movie well worth a place in any movie collection both for fans of Burton, Depp, Bonham Carter, or not. I will definitely watch this movie again, just to pay extra attention to the details in the shots."
"imdb-211","3","2","4","30 July 2012"," Unlikable hero, mostly entertaining movie
","Dark Shadows was mostly entertaining, apart from some slow parts, and an overdone, unmotivated ending.<br/><br/>But what struck me most about the movie was how twisted its ""ethics"" were. Basically, the movie's ""hero"" is a horrible person, and, by the way, a serial murderer. The ""villain"", on the other hand, is a woman who started out as a maid, was abused by her employer (the aforementioned ""hero""), and founded a company that eventually put her former employer's company out of business. The ""happy ending"" of the movie is the ""hero"" murdering her, presumably in retribution for her crime of being ""uppity"".<br/><br/>Along the way, there's also a female doctor, whom he murders because she tries to become a vampire. Yet he has no particular issues turning his girlfriend into a vampire later on, to prevent her from dying.<br/><br/>All of this made it very hard for me to identify with the movie's ostensible hero. It's sometimes fun to root for the bad guy, but when it becomes obvious that the bad guy is actually the good guy, while the good guy is a horrible person, the whole thing can quickly turn into a very frustrating experience."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","4","15 June 2012"," Somewhat boring and unfocused
","The thing about Johnny Depp and Tim Burton is that both of them are rather brilliant in their own right. They have a lot of talent, are very creative and they have made some seriously good films during their time in the business. It's just that their collaborations are starting to feel a bit stale. And I don't really blame Johnny Depp in this case, because even though his performance in this movie is not on par with his usual flair, he's still somewhat entertaining and unique. Rather I blame Tim Burton for not even trying. Because that's the key fault with this movie: it's lazy, uninteresting and unfocused.<br/><br/>Let's start with the plot, which is all over the place. The basic premise is that an ancient vampire wakes up in the 70s to find his family line in ruins, his manor about to crumple into dust and his worst enemy leading a rival company against his own factory. Fair enough, this is interesting and would allow for a lot of humour or dark drama. However, Burton should have picked one of these approaches and stuck with it. Instead he chose to go with both, which doesn't work at all. Sometimes you can mix emotional drama and humour together, but in this case it's a case of lowest common denominator humour mixed with angst. The case isn't really helped by the subpar actors, who are either completely wooden in their performances (anyone other than the main stars) or try to be both funny and dramatic at the same time (the main stars).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the story isn't focused enough and in the end leaves much too many questions unanswered. For example, at the beginning we are introduced to the love interest of the film, played by Bella Heathcote, and we spend a lot of time with her, getting to know how she acts and what makes her tick. And we think, okay, this chick is going to be Barnabas' (Johnny Depp) main lady, his foil and love interest in the same package. But when Depp's character is introduced we never she her again except in very brief scenes that feel rushed and forced, like they tried to fool us into thinking that these two are developing their chemistry, even though they're not. And then the character suddenly returns at the end of the film when it's time for Barnabas to get his girl. And I ask: how do you make that mistake, Tim Burton? That's basic film making 101. The love interest needs to be within the movie, she needs to interact with the protagonist with more than four lines of dialogue. Add in the bizarre twists during the final confrontation with Barnabas' rival and the nonsensical subplot with the father and you have a plot that makes no sense, has no coherence whatsoever and is quite frankly rather boring.<br/><br/>So the drama doesn't work. What about the humour? Unfortunately it's rather boring as well. I remember having smiled or smirked once or twice when Johnny Depp's character deadpanned something or the other, but I think that it was more because I sort of forced myself to laugh at him rather than because he was actually funny. And the rest of the characters aren't any better. Watch the trailer if you want to get most of the best jokes. And I use the term best loosely.<br/><br/>And finally, the usual best part of Burton's films: the visuals. Well, they actually weren't that bad. The colour palette was a bit grey and colorless, plus Johnny Depp still looked rather well-kept even though he himself has stated that they tried to make him unappealing. (A hint: This is Johnny Depp we're talking about, more effort than an oily haircut is required.) But otherwise the movie looks just fine. Not Burton's best movie in that regard by far, but it could have been worse. And some of the visuals jokes were actually somewhat creative.<br/><br/>So yeah, don't go see this film, it's not worth it. Let Tim Burton learn that we have had enough. He needs to step up his game, stop relying on the same old tricks and do something new. The old formula hasn't worked in his favour for some time now and this is the final proof of that. It's a mess and has very little value to anyone. It's not horrible to watch, per se, but it's very, very disappointing."

Maybe I'm in the wrong demographic. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the many 1970s references. <br/><br/>This movie had a few laughs. However, mostly the fun seemed forced. The hippie scene, for example. <br/><br/>The strange thing is that the performances delivered by Depp, Bonham Carter, Pfeiffer, Green and the others were actually quite good. Depp was amusing and seemed to be enjoying the hand thing. Bonham Carter is always good. I love her.<br/><br/>When I attended this movie, there were only three people in the theatre. And I have to admit I dozed off during the first half hour.<br/><br/>I want to give it a 5.5, but I've rounded it down.<br/><br/>I'm surely not the only one who is a little tired of the vampire, zombie and werewolf theme. I refuse to go to a Twilight movie. Don't get me wrong. When they're well done, I enjoy them as much as everyone else. But they just seem to be everywhere lately.

"Thomas-Giffin","7","2","4","1 June 2012"," Not great but watchable
","I have never watched Dark Shadows, the television show that ran for 5 years in the late 1960s. A Gothic horror soap opera (my mind thinks of The Munsters and The Adams Family, correct me if I'm wrong) about the family Collins has been turned into a reasonably good film, directed by the Gothic master Tim Burton and starring everyone's favourite odd-ball actor Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Filled with the typical Burton-isms you'd expect, fog, ships, Gothic architecture , Johnny Depp, vampirish women, the film is not breaking new ground or even the best of Burton's oeuvre but it makes for a passable way to spend the day.<br/><br/>However, the most surprising thing that struck me was two aspects of the film that I was not at all expecting: the first is that it is surprisingly violent, everyone's heartthrob Depp kills a load of people (not well advertised), the second is that it is pretty risqué (advertised), certainly much more than I was expecting when I first sat in my chair. Certainly Eva Green's method of seduction appears to be exploiting the fact that she is extremely attractive with a nice chest, not that I, as an average film goer was complaining, it just was not something I was expecting to feature so....prominently in the film. In regards to the film's violence, it is not gruesome but it must be said that Depp contributes to a rather high bodycount in this film.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is pure Burton. Ghosts, curses and jilted lovers all appear several times throughout the film. The film's plot essentially focuses on Eva Green's Angelique Bouchard and the reason why she's such a meany to poor old Johnny Depp and her attempts to manipulate and force her way into his heart. Add into this dashes of family business rivalry, a lavish party attended by Alice Cooper (his cameo one of the film's highlights!) and an utterly insane and strange plot twist at the end that made literally not one jot of sense to me and you end up with a well scripted, well directed, well acted film that suffers from bad pacing and walking the uncomfortable line between not being that funny and not being scary.<br/><br/>In terms of humour, it is down to three aspects:<br/><br/>Jackie Earl Haley as the caretaker. He is funny. Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Julia Hoffman, not as funny as Haley but still gets some of the best line. The 1972 setting. Not used as well as it could have been but Depp's man-out-of-time routine does raise some laughs and the soundtrack is pure awesome (Cooper's cameo counts towards this 3rd point.)<br/><br/>In the end however, Dark Shadows is not as funny as Burton's finest, nor as scary as Burton's finest. Johnny Depp is better here than in a lot of recent Tim Burton films (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland) and the supporting cast here work really well. Carter and Haley I've mentioned already but Michelle Pfeiffer is great as the matriarch, leading to some quality scenes with Eva Green. Speaking of Green, she is one of Burton's finest vampish woman and she shines in this film too. Chloe Grace Moretz is pretty good as a rebellious daughter but the previously mentioned insane plot twist includes her and it just didn't work for me. Finally, and I must mention this because it is too awesome for words, another cameo from greatest man ever, Christopher Lee as a grizzled fisherman had me smiling like a crazy man.<br/><br/>So all in all, not the best film I've seen all year, not the best Tim Burton film I've seen, not the best Johnny Depp film I've seen but overall, it is a passable film and one I enjoyed watching."

","This collaboration has worked very well in the past (see Sleepy Hollow) but there is little to like in their latest movie; Dark Shadows. I never watched the original TV series but I was forewarned that the movie bore little or no resemblance. No matter, if not for the loud, sound effect laden soundtrack this film would make an excellent, non-narcotic cure for insomnia. Others have noted and let me echo their complaints that this movie was neither comedy or drama. Although it tried to be both it achieved neither. Fine performances notwithstanding there was no reason to make this movie and no reason to see it. A few technical things that bothered me; If Depp is a vampire, how is it he walks about in daylight protected only by heavy clothing, sunglasses and an umbrella? And if Depp is from Liverpool why does he speak in a generic, London type accent? That's like believing that folks from Boston and Memphis sound alike because they're from the same country. Depp's penchant for chameleon makeup and foreign accents is wearing very thin. What happened to the guy in Donnie Brasco or Gilbert Grape? You know, an American guy!"

","Grim and wacky auteur Tim Burton, a director who you may remember best for terrific movies like Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, and Ed Wood, gives us the first of his two 2012 directed features. Dark Shadows, based on the long running TV series created by Dan Curtis, features Burton's undeniably quirky stamp, but it also turns out to be his least entertaining movie since Planet of the Apes.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas Collins, a man from the 18th century who is cursed to be a vampire after toying with the heart of a woman who turns out to be a witch. For this, the Collins family is historically cursed, and Barnabas, locked in a coffin for nearly 200 years, awakens in 1972. The Collins family business, led by matriarch Elizabeth, is flailing. Overpowered by the business led by a rival company, the brains of which belong to Angelique, the woman who cursed Barnabas. Barnabas seeks to restore the Collins business it to its original grandeur, win the heart of a young woman, and figure out what sorcery powers a television.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie lies with writer Seth Grahame-Smith. The screenplay is seriously awful. The back stories of the characters are interesting, but somewhere in the writing, something just rings untrue. These characters have so much potential, but the emotional involvement is unsatisfying, the development falls flat and inconsistent, and the structure just feels off. The movie itself also lacks rhythm. It struggles to find a consistent tone, thrown off course by irritating pacing shifts, and the kind of quirky humor that normally works for Burton's films, but feels wildly uneven here.<br/><br/>As for the cast, there's plenty of talent, but not enough chemistry. Oddly enough, the cast do succeed in bringing something out of nothing roles, except perhaps Chloe Moretz and Johnny Miller. Eva Green, delightfully wicked and menacingly funny as Angelique, is one worth mentioning. Johnny Depp, as well, remains just as deliriously enjoyable as ever. Even if the fish out of water humor feels a bit much, he still manages to leave one in fits of laughter, especially in the hysterical floor-wall-ceiling love scene in Angelique's office.<br/><br/>And since it's a Burton movie, it looks just as good. Definitely his most beautifully designed movie since Sleepy Hollow, and arguably his most beautifully designed movie ever. Rick Heinrichs' production design, Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography, Joel Harlow and Paul Gooch's makeup, and especially Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes are properly elegant. Burton's composer of choice, Danny Elfman, brings on yet another great musical score as well. However, it takes more to make a good movie than pretty imagery. A good movie requires true heart, which Dark Shadows unfortunately lacks.<br/><br/>***/ *****"

Some critical mistakes.<br/><br/>Mainly Depp's character. He's a good guy supposedly turned into a monster who does terrible things and kills a lot of people. He has no choice? This drive is compelling?<br/><br/>BUT, if he is a good man and OUR hero, why doesn't he just walk outside in his underwear and let the sun kill him? To save his soul and innocent victims. He doesn't even kill bad people. He doesn't try to just drink animal blood as a panacea.<br/><br/>That is overlooked. For its flaws, this was addressed with the Hulk character in The Avengers. Dr. Banner said he tried to eat a bullet to save the innocent from The Hulk's rage. But the Hulk spit the bullet out. Thus, he had no choice but to live and try to manage his burden. But Depp's character had a clear choice and didn't take it. Thus, I could not sympathize with him, even though the character was likable when that element was gone.<br/><br/>And this is based on a soap opera that I never saw. What I saw was a film that was satirical look at a stilted original. But the jokes didn't work. They were stale and mildly amusing at best.<br/><br/>And the love story was poorly established. Depp is smitten with Victoria. Then it's dropped 'til SUDDENLY Depp is in love with her. No long looks from across the room?<br/><br/>Worth a look. Don't get me wrong.

The trailer seemed to be quite Johnny style and should be humorous somehow. <br/><br/>However, in this film...what a terrible movie...such an old school stuff without any surprising. If you are looking for any hilarious parts, don't waste your time to dig in this film... coz there is no blood, no sex, no funny things, no love in this movie... this movie is made for pre-schooler for sure..."

","Dark Shadows is a comedy...or maybe a horror...then again, it was a romance...or sci-fi/fantasy...yet, it was a drama. <br/><br/>Confused? Yeah, me too. <br/><br/>After seeing this movie, there was only one word I could come up with that would describe it- odd. Maybe it's because I never saw the original soap opera and went into the movie with no background information. Or maybe the soap opera was just as weird. Either way, my reaction as a Dark Shadows novice was speechlessness. I don't even know how to sum up the movie, it was just so weird. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it was not a bad movie. The acting was great, and the old fashion costumes were gorgeous. The sets were pretty amazing as well; they were very detailed. The story line was the thing that baffled me. It was just so ""out there"" and constantly changing tones. One minute I wanted to hide behind my hands, the next I was laughing, then I wanted to cry, and eventually I sat there thinking ""what the heck just happened?"".<br/><br/>So, if your a fan of the original Dark Shadows soap opera, I say give this movie a try. Maybe it will make more sense to you than it did for me. If you haven't seen the TV show, be ready for an interesting couple of hours..."

","Yes, it's old-fashioned (so is the TV-Gothic-soap Dark Shadows as well), but the actors do so well (especially Jonny Depp as eccentric Vampire Barnaby and Eva Green as wonderfully mean witch Angelique) that i smiled amused throughout the movie. Great Music (love Carpenters), bloody moments, playful jokes and beautiful, fantastic decor and interiors make it fun. Despite the glimpse-short cameo of Dark Shadows veterans Jonathan Frid, David Selby, Lara Parker & Kathryn Leigh-Scott (you catch them as party attenders at Collingwood) disappoints, the whole storyline bout Jonny Lee Miller does not touched me at all and some bumpy parts in the middle - still 6 out of 10!"

","Meh... that was our reaction when the credits rolled after seeing Dark Shadows. I wasn't even planning to go see him in the cinema, but my friends wanted to see him and just went along. Afterwards, they liked it even less than me, which was funny. Everyone is talking about the collaborations of Burton and Depp. I dunno, IMO they make only movies for themselves and if the public likes them, they got lucky. Separately they are brilliant and both have great movies. Together, something happens... every movie is ""different"" to say the least. I think Sleepy Hollow is still their best one yet, and I don't think they can top it. This one however... I'm never going to see again. Because what is it about, do we even have to think about this one? Why did they even take time and money to make it?? Is this what people are waiting for I wonder. OK, short overview: Visuals were great as we've come to expect of Burton. Depp is a great actor, but stuck in a terrible roll. Eva Green is as hot as they come!! The red dress!! The young girl, who I recognized from Kick-Ass is growing up nicely... I know she's fifteen, but you can already tell she's gonna be a beauty in years to come. I actually liked her performance best of all, until she became a *spoiler* at the end when the whole movie was ready to be put out with the trash. What sucked? Everything else... story? no Plot? even less Idiotic chars? Too much! So to conclude: better watch the old goodies once more and keep up the dream of their perfect collaborations. <br/><br/>Best regards, Raf"

","Knowing in advance that this one was a send-up wasn't warning enough, because it was Tim Burton at the wheel, with Johnny Depp riding shotgun. What could go wrong...? Well, what went wrong was the ****ing SCRIPT. This DARK SHADOWS (unlike the series that spawned it) is so badly written that it REEKS. So many opportunities were missed, even given the premise: it would've been far funnier to have the boy, David (played here by another of those bland child actors who don't really seem to belong on screen these days), be the one to experiment with mind-altering drugs or to play rock and roll records backward (giving Depp as Barny reason to believe that The Devil does indeed hold sway in the swingin' 70s); or to really explore pop psychology with Dr. Hoffman; or to have Barny in bell-bottoms- or dressed like Superfly after taking in a ""shadow play""; or have Barny cringing behind a couch while watching the original broadcast of Dan Curtis's teleclassic, THE NIGHTSTALKER; or to have Barny emerge at film's end from his coffin prison into the early 21st century... The possibilities are endless, but whoever wrote this one apparently didn't really think things through- proof enough of that being that any send-up of DARK SHADOWS would absolutely HAVE to hark back to THE MUNSTERS and THE ADDAMS FAMILY. Not that it's ALL bad: Depp is still most adept at creating a likable character, even given the lackluster nature of the material he's been given, and the movie looks gorgeous. The music never settles in long enough to establish any real mood, however, and the climactic pyrotechnics are just so much sturm und drang, signifying nothing. Subtle, it ain't."

But there are somethings that dragged it down. #1. Half of the elements were unestablished. Everything seemed to just come out of nowhere without rhyme or reason. Then once they suddenly happen, they serve no purpose. #2. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM: The child actors are HORRIBLE! The boy, I could stand. He doesn't really do much. But the girl, was so bad, I can't comprehend why someone would cast her, I can't comprehend why she would deliver lines the way she did. I kid you not. She made her character so flat, I just wanted some one to deck her every time she said anything or walk on screen with her stupid expression. This movie just didn't work because it just never felt right and nothing made any sense. But there is some entertainment value in some of the jokes and some of the things that are so bad they are funny. So you might give this a rental if you and some friends want to have a laugh."

","Director Tim Burton's DARK SHADOWS is a frightfully good, neo-Gothic horror / comedy film. It's also a nice tribute to / parody of the original TV series from Dan Curtis. Johnny Depp's take on Barnabas Collins is hilarious and perfectly grim. Eva Green is quite sinister in her role as Barnabas' spiteful nemesis, Angelique Bouchard. The inimitable Michelle Pfeiffer returns to Burton-land as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Chloe Grace Moretz continues her rise as a horror movie star as young, scene-stealing Carolyn Stoddard. Helena Bonham Carter is on hand as Dr. Julia Hoffman. Though humorous, this movie retains its creepiness, and has more of the red stuff than most PG-13 productions. The story line manages to be fun and satisfying for fans of the old series, while not alienating the uninitiated. Taking place in 1972, the clothes, cars, and music capture much of that decade's ambiance. Watch for Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper in cameos! Macabre and mirthful..."

","Dark Shadows is another very underrated Tim flick! Based on an obscure 70s TV show of the same name, the story starts in 1760, the Collins' family business in fish mongering is booming. Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is the heir of the family, deeply in love with Josette (Bella Heathcote). He therefore breaks the heart of a young witch named Angelique (Eva Green) who then curses him to be a vampire and live forever trapped in a coffin, locked away with his own dark thoughts. Fast forward to 1972, Barnabas is discovered and finally released from his tomb where he can meet his family of today and help the family business thrive again. Depp has a lot of fun in the role of Barnabas; it's an amazing opportunity to explore the classic vampire tropes and he does it brilliantly! The romantic dialogue, the hypnotic effect on people and of course the bloody meal times are all here and it's refreshing to see a more traditional approach to vampirism projected again. The entire cast have an absolute ball; it's great to see Michelle Pfieffer back in the Burton universe, Chloe Grace Moretz continues her fantastic career in another wonderful role that really taps into the troubled teenager feeling well! I think its Eva Green's best role to date also; she captures the spirit of the classic Burton femme fatale perfectly, in the spirit of Catwoman and the Martian lady beforehand, with added witchcraft! She is at the forefront of perhaps the most impressive sequence towards the end of the film, where she gets to work her supernatural trickery to its creepiest effect on the Collins' family. The laughs are mainly brought from the dynamic of a 17th century man suddenly slap bang in the middle of the late 1900s and his confusion at the concept of television ('tiny songstress!'), extreme old-fashioned approach to marriage and his obsession with lava lamps! It really works and it's the performances that make the lines shine brightly. A rewatchable horror-comedy treat!"

","By all rights, I should hate this movie, but I always end up watching it and enjoying it. There's my confession.<br/><br/>I mean, it's a Johnny Depp starring, Tim Burton directed and Seth Grame-Greene (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter) take on one of my favorite shows ever. I should be judgier.<br/><br/>Yet it does what it should do: it makes me return to the original series and savor it, missing those foam tombstones after seeing just how gorgeous Collinwood could be with an actual budget.<br/><br/>Fifteen years after Barnabas Collins and his family move from Liverpool to Maine - establishing the town of Collinsport and Collinwood - our hero spurns that affections of Angelique (Eva Green), who murders his parents and curses him to be a vampire, forever doomed to watch all whom he loves die. She then turns the town against him, who bury him as a witch after his fiancee Josette falls from a cliff.<br/><br/>Yes, Josette is the ancestor that Maggie Evans (who is kind of combined with the Victoria Winters character from the original show) is the reincarnated form of. She's played by Bella Heathcote and feels drawn to become the governess of modern day Collinwood.<br/><br/>The family has fallen on hard times. There's the matriarch, Elizabeth (Michelle Pfieffer), her rebellious teenage werewolf daughter Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz), her brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller), his son David and live-in psychiatrist Dr. Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), here to treat David who keeps seeing the phoenix-like ghost of his mother Laura.<br/><br/>A construction crew digs up Barnabas' grave and soon, he's taken over Willie (Jackie Earle Hadley) as his servant and is back in the family, returning their fishing company to prominence. Of course, his old enemy and lover Angelique runs the town with her fishing company Angel Bay. Despite an initial rekindling of affections, she is soon trying to destroy the Collins family all over again.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of fun parts, like a party with Alice Cooper playing multiple songs, Christopher Lee showing up as the king of the fishermen and best of all, Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott all making a quick cameo during the party scene. Sadly, Frid would die soon after filming his scene. However, the original cast would report that they were treated as royalty and Depp would say to Frid, ""None of this would be possible had it not been for you."""

","1752, Maine. After Barnabas Collins (Depp) spurns the love of witch Angelique Bouchard (Green), she sends his beloved Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote) to her death, turns him into a vampire and then buries him alive. Two centuries later Barnabas returns and vows to restore the family name and manor to its former glories.
Tim Burton turned 14 in 1972, the year Dark Shadows is mostly set. Although it is based on Dan Curtis' late-60s supernatural soap (a prime influence on Burton's melding of the spooky and the kitsch), it can also be read as semi- autobiography. Not that the young Burton slept hanging from curtains or sucked the blood of hippies (then again, who knows?), but, as a teen weaned on Edgar Allan Poe, Hammer horror and Harryhausen, he must have felt a similar sense of profound dislocation to Dark Shadows' vampire, Barnabas Collins, in the age of Farrah Fawcett flicks and Disco (not Dante's) Inferno. It's this sense of alienation that Dark Shadows invokes, then plays for tons of fun.<br/><br/>For Johnny Depp's Barnabas, all Nosferatu hand gestures and Romantic formality, is a brilliantly realised anachronism rudely transplanted into the '70s, misinterpreting the McDonald's golden arches, freaked out by asphalt, completely bemused by the concepts of waffles and lava lamps. He is a man out of time who thinks the answer to any woe is to throw a ball and recites the lyrics to Steve Miller's The Joker as if it were Romantic poetry. As a kid, Depp used to run home from school to watch Jonathan Frid's Barnabas on TV. Here, he has fully honoured his hero, creating a funny, charismatic monster who is struggling to figure out what it means to be human.<br/><br/>Which is just as well, for Dark Shadows has a compelling central character but not a real centre. There are lots of story strands vying for attention - Barnabas' mission to revitalise the family fishing business, his wooing of the new housekeeper (Bella Heathcote), his sessions with Helena Bonham Carter's live-in psychiatrist - but ultimately all get short shrift. The overarching story charts Barnabas' passionate feud with witch Angelique (Eva Green, looking the part rather than owning it) but, save a memorable Barry White-scored sex scene, this feels repetitive and never really catches fire. Michelle Pfeiffer adds grace and class as head of the household Elizabeth, but the rest of the family, from Jonny Lee Miller's bad-egg brother and Chloë Grace Moretz's wild-child daughter to Gulliver McGrath's troubled son, never really register as they should.<br/><br/>Yet the biggest problem lies with tone. The TV show was renowned for its Ed Wood-like shonky sets, strange line readings and booms in shot, yet Burton eschews this in favour of high-end production value - Collinwood Manor is production-designed to within an inch of its life and Danny Elfman's score impressively broods- played against a stylised acting approach that hints at the show's amateur origins.<br/><br/>Beyond the vampire-in-the-'70s schtick, Burton's love of full-on Gothic flash and thunder (the prologue goes full Sleepy Hollow) and the gruesome (Barnabas' murder of some hapless workmen would sit right at home in Let The Right One In) gets full reign. Yet the director and screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, so he has previous with monster mash-ups) never corral the comedy, the horror, the family saga and the Gothic romance into a completely satisfying brew; it all feels about five per cent off. Perhaps the film it most resembles, especially as it moves towards its CG-fuelled climax, is Death Becomes Her, an entertaining if oddball mélange of the dark, the comedic and the blockbuster.
A word of warning: this is not the knockabout comedy the trailer suggests. Instead, it cleaves closer to what you expect from Burton: darkness, quirk and Johnny Depp on great form. A step up, then, from Alice In Wonderland and Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, but not tip-top Tim."

We were somewhat disappointed. <br/><br/>To be sure, Johnny Depp does a good job with the material he was given here. His character however doesn't inspire fear or dread, like Jonathan Frid's, or even Ben Cross's Barnabas Collins did. His character, especially in the second half of the movie, was more of a comic portrayal of Barnabas (a la Dracula in one of Tim Kelly's Dracula plays). Also Eva Green just isn't as delightfully creepy as Lara Parker. Although I love Michelle Pfeiffer, I feel she was totally miscast as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. <br/><br/>To be fair, there were moments of humor in the original Dark Shadows. Most of those however were unintentional (for example, in one scene you can see a stage hand waving a stick around making a vampire bat fly). The series overall however was suspenseful and sometimes frightening: the first two movies had that too. Tim Burton's Dark Shadows has overdone humor, comical special effects, and almost none of the suspense. I enjoyed watching it once, but I'll pass on watching it again."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Dark Shadows.<br/><br/>Following on from Alice In Wonderland being a blockbuster hit for Burton and Depp, expectations were high for this one, and I had high hopes too. I had not loved a Depp movie since Sweeney Todd (5 years and 8 movies ago) but the trailer looked promising and when Depp teamed up with Burton, I always enjoyed it. However, whilst this starts off promising, this is a bit of a mess. I think Burton tried to start a franchise and set about trying to incorporate too many subplots into the first movie (A common flaw these days) and a potentially fun movie gets lost. It's not all bad, it does make good use of the 70's music for example. A lot of the humorous moments come from Depp's reactions to 1970s pop culture and I enjoyed the love scene set to Barry White.<br/><br/>If they had set out to make a straight comedy like 21 Jump Street, it may have worked. But it's uneven tone makes it impossible to enjoy. Apparently, Depp was a big fan of the original series, and he was really excited to be playing Barnabus. This is the eighth collaboration between Burton and Depp and Burton is the director behind some of his greatest movies. Sadly ever since he graced our cinemas as Captain Jack Sparrow the fine actor of the '90s and early '00s has been replaced by a man with a penchant for over-the-top antics. His Barnabas is a drag, but not because he resembles a drag queen. It's because he seems to belong in another movie. He is far too camp for this movie's darker moments.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfieffer is ok, Eva Green is quite good, Helena Bonham Carter is surprisingly bland as is Johnny Lee Miller, whilst Chloe Grace Moretz is fine too, Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper pop up in cameos. This is the last film Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter worked on before their relationship ended. This was also Producer Richard D. Zanuck's (Jaws) last film.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows grossed $79 million at the domestic box office to end 2012 as the 39th highest grossing movie of the year!!"

She causes the death of Barnabas's parents then causes his true love Josette DuPres to throw herself off a cliff. Barnabas tries to end his own life but the curse causes him to become a vampire. The townspeople place him in a coffin and bury him. Almost two centuries later, in 1972, construction workers dig him up and he returns home. He finds that the curse is still affecting the remaining members of his family who have fallen on hard times. He is determined to help them return to their rightful place in society but Angelique is still around and she is still determined to make Barnabas suffer.<br/><br/>When I watched this film I'd not even heard of the original TV show so didn't have too much idea what to expect beyond what it said on the DVD's case. I think having no preconceived ideas may have helped as I rather enjoyed it. Johnny Depp does a fine job as Barnabas; he isn't too scary for younger viewers even when killing various people. These deaths aren't dwelt on and are filmed in a way that makes them almost comic. The rest of the cast are pretty good too; notably Eva Green who plays Angelique, a character that is both seductive as well as unpleasant; Helena Bonham Carter is delightfully over the top as the family psychiatrist; Michelle Pfeiffer does a good job as family matriarch Elizabeth and Chloë Grace Moretz impresses as her teenage daughter Carolyn. Bella Heathcote also impresses as Victoria Winters, the apparently normal young woman who serves to introduce us to the family by moving in as the new governess although it is clear that she isn't quite what she seems. The idea of a strange family living in an imposing mansion will inevitably remind many viewers of 'The Addams Family' but this bunch are distinctly more dysfunctional. The '70s setting provided a good excuse for a retro soundtrack and even a cameo from singer Alice Cooper which was all rather fun. Overall I rather enjoyed this even if the final confrontation was a bit too much of a cliché. While it isn't a must see film I'd recommend it to fans of director Tim Burton or of any of the main cast."

","As Hollywood movies get worse and worse, past legends lose as well their brilliance (except Spielberg). Here Tim sure doesn't reach the levels of his 80s – 90s works but it's a bit better than his more recent works I understand that it's a TV show adaptation but the idea of medieval characters getting out of sync with our modern technological time is the idea of our french top movie comedy « Les Visiteurs » ! At least, it's funny and Deep is unusually good with his noble manners ! I really like how the mansion was crazily Gothic, the 70s fashion and songs.

""Rorsaach"" and Michelle was astounding all the more it has been ages that I haven't seen her and Green (who looked like Tim's past girlfriend especially when she did the martian girl) was a thousand time more hot there than in the ""Sin City"" sequel ! On the contrary, Miller, Carter and above all Moretz are just insipid ! Beyond this, there is really a story problem as it keeps repeating the same idea, the same dialogs (Green wants Deep as a lover and Deep isn't agree) and the violent finale is just a very cheap way to conclude this drama !"

","Tim Burton's adaptation of the classic Gothic soap opera of the 1960s delivers exactly what you'd expect based on the theatrical poster and the trailer. The usual Burton fare: a very stylish, beautifully photographed Gothic-romantic comedy with the motif of fateful eternal love, balancing between the spooky and the campy, marred by an uneven script and capped by a less than satisfying, somewhat illogical final showdown (as in Sleepy Hollow).<br/><br/>Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (Amélie, Harry Potter & The Half-Blood Prince) was a great choice as his style perfectly matches Burton's. The gorgeous visuals, mixing eerie darkness and the colourful world of the early 1970s are the greatest strength of the film. Apart from that, there's nothing particularly interesting, nor particularly jarring here. Some jokes work, some don't. The story is all right, the pacing is okay, the characters are fine, though some of them are underdeveloped (especially Victoria/Josette and Carolyn), and the special effects are executed well (the one I liked the most was Angelique's 'fragile skin'). It's just nothing special.<br/><br/>All in all, Dark Shadows is enjoyable, harmless, but mostly forgettable entertainment. It may work best if you've never seen a Tim Burton movie, as the visuals are indeed impressive, and his unique style is probably the most consistent here (and in Sleepy Hollow). If you're looking for a Burton movie with a more lasting impression, however, check out Ed Wood or Big Fish instead."

","Even though I kind of like Dark Shadows, it is a shame it does not follow up on a rather awesome scene quite early in the movie. What I'm referring to is a rather violent scene, I won't go into detail because spoilers, but let's just say it's pretty cool. It really looks like Tim Burtons way of portraying some vampire-related violence.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, the scene I'm talking about does not represent much of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I do think this movie is the kind of movie that sort of grows on you. The first time I saw it I had some expectations, they were not really met. But then I caught parts of it on television later, and I found it more entertaining. <br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a little bit more of the old Tim Burton we know and love, not so much the new one. Yes, it has Johnny Depp, but still I find it to be more Batman/Scissorhands and less Alice in Wonderland. <br/><br/>It is a little on the long side, I would have liked if it were a little darker, some more vampire violence, but hey, what are ya gonna do!? It is uneven, and that is much of the reason why I didn't like it better. I hope Mr. Burton continues in this track, rather than the track he has been on the last 10-ish years.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is alright in this, but Tim Burton, you have got to stop having him in everything you make."

","Dark Shadows (2012): Dir: Tim Burton / Cast: Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, Bella Heathcote, Helena Bonham Carter: Remake of a soap opera from the 1960's / 70's, and it regards the skeletons in our closets. It begins in the several centuries ago with Johnny Depp playing Barnabas Collins whose relationship is severed when he rejects the advances of a witch. As a result his parents are killed, then his lover is placed under a spell that has her walk over a cliff to her death. Collins dives to his death but the witch's curse renders him a vampire. Further rejections renders him locked in a coffin until he is dug up in 1972. He reenters the Collins residence where some humour emerges from his transcend into the 1970's. Unfortunately the premise gives way to subplots that never seem complete. We have Barnabas giving the father of the house a decision but it seems like a cop out. The whole subplot about the female doctor seems out of place. Then we have a wooden character played by Bella Heathcote whose image represents Barnabas's deceased lover. She is suppose to tutor the boy of the house but that subplot seems forgotten. Depp is amusing as Barnabas in his eighth collaboration with Tim Burton, but this is no Sleepy Hollow. Michelle Pfeiffer steals moments as the head of the Collins house, and Eva Green is terrific as the witch who has a high flying sex scene with Depp. Helena Bonham Carter is given a rather unnecessary role as a doctor of sorts who knows a secret and fails to reveal it. The visual effects are exquisite but the screenplay seems hidden in the darkest shadows. Score: 5 ½ / 10"

","When Tim Burton and Johnny Depp come together one already knows what to expect. Dark Shadows is the 8th film directed by Burton with Depp in the cast, the first one being Edward Scissorhands from 1990, maybe the most famous of all. We already know that a fantastic and strange world of weird beauty and ugliness will be created on screen. We know that it will be scary but that we need not take it more serious than necessary because we are now adults and fairy tales do not scare us any longer (do they?). We also know that Depp will again be hard to recognize, but will be himself as well, another entry in a series of fantastic characters that we - who love the actor - wish will last for as long as possible.<br/><br/>'Dark Shadows' is inspired by a TV show which gained cult status in the late 60s and early 70s which I have never seen or heard about before. It starts as a Gothic witches and vampires story in the 18th century to continue as a back-from-grave witches and vampire comical action in the contemporaneity of the TV show. Tim Burton and his script writers chose the path of creating from the perspective of 2012 a retro-actual comedy combined with situation gags about the culture, revolts and music of the 70s including a cameo appearance of Alice Cooper. These are actually some of the funniest moments in the film, as the rest of the story is pretty conventional and does not exceed the level of a mediocre comics-inspired intrigue.<br/><br/>Acting-wise we have of course Depp, as pale and as weird as ever. Besides Depp the film is blessed with exquisite cast including Michelle Pfeiffer which unfortunately seems lately to fade away from important roles, Eva Green which has a love scene like you never saw on screens before with Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter which I wish had spent more time on screen. And yet, despite moments of fun and splendid visuals that only the imagination of Burton can create, something is missing in the script. I did not see the TV show, and yet I had a very strong feeling of deja vu which could not be completely balanced by acting and spectacular visuals. A movie relying only or mostly on visual effects, as perfect as they may be, risks to feel like unfinished."
"gizmomogwai","6","0","0","3 July 2014"," One vampire I wouldn't mind driving a stake through
","I'm a fan of Tim Burton, at least his older work, and Dark Shadows, as a dark comedy, may seem right up his alley. Much of the look of the film is technically sound, and the actors, particularly Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Chloe Moretz, do what they can with the material. Alas, that material is weak, and Dark Shadows becomes a drag to sit through. <br/><br/>The story follows Barnabas, a man cursed by a witch to become a vampire, and is then locked in a coffin and buried by the village people for 200 years. He is released in 1972 (Deliverance is playing at the theatre), bent on reuniting with his living family, restoring the family business and triumphing over the witch, who has gone on to found a rival company.<br/><br/>Except for one crack about equality of the sexes and the bit about stoning the vampire, all of the jokes fall flat. There's many of the same old tired jokes we've seen before in stories about someone from another era or world falling into our own- looking for a sorceress songstress in a TV, Depp saying inexplicable things and Pfeiffer's character covering it up as best as she can. Stale jokes about immortal breasts not ageing fail to impress. As well, none of these characters are endearing at all. Reciting The Joker doesn't make Depp's character lovable enough to pardon him for mass murdering innocent workmen and hippies. Let the Right One In (2008) had a killer vampire you couldn't help but hope would survive and get away. I wouldn't mind driving a stake through Barnabas myself; at least the movie would end quicker. It's under two hours, but feels longer. This certainly isn't Burton's best work; at least it's better than Mars Attacks!"

"C22Man","6","0","0","31 January 2014"," Solid but slightly wasted effort from Burton & Depp
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team up once again, and the results produce something of a mixed bag. The partnership between the two started off well, but lost steam thanks to poor efforts like 'Charlie and The Chocolate Factory' and 'Alice in Wonderland' remakes. Dark Shadows falls into the middle for both. The film, an adaption of the Gothic soap opera, does have a lot of good things whilst also failing in much of what it attempts. There was a lot of potential for a really great movie, and that might be what makes the film come off as somewhat disappointing.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire whose family once ran the local fishing port. He rises after being imprisoned for two centuries to find his modern relatives and business in a state of disarray. Collins also discovers that the witch who cursed and imprisoned him has taken over the towns fishing business. He quickly sets about to improve the family, get used to his new surroundings and lift the curse upon him. The plot does have an interesting set-up and some smart ideas. The major issue with the story, and most of the film, is that it strongly lacks focus. It is like Burton doesn't know what area to concentrate on and that makes it come across as messy. Not enough time is spent on the family, the love interest, the business or Barnabas himself for you to truly care.<br/><br/>The point that film lacks focus is what lets it down. It would have made much more sense to, for example, focus on Barnabas' interactions with family than just jump for one piece to another. This made the whole love aspect with Victoria seem slightly forced and meant that the relationship with Angelique was not as fleshed out as it could have been. The same issue applies in genre choices. Dark Shadows is unable to decide whether it is a comedy, horror or straight-up drama. It has successful elements of all three genres, but these elements could have been used much better if it picked one and went with it. The constant genre hopping once again harms the films instead of improving it.<br/><br/>Despite many blasting Johnny Depp's performance as the vampire lead, I don't think he does a bad job. He looks great under the heavy make-up and he brings some quirky mannerisms to the role that fit in rather well. His delivery of certain lines and expressions are just naturally funny. The character is not that well written, so Depp deserves some applause for being so entertaining. The rest of the cast sadly feel somewhat wasted. Michelle Pfeiffer was enjoyable as she usually is as the head of the family, but she isn't given enough material to work with. Jackie Earle Haley is very funny as the surly Collins caretaker and easily gets some of the funniest pieces of the movie. Eva Green does a good job as the greedy witch, but she needed to be fleshed out more. Bella Heathcote is decent as the wide- eyed Victoria, but again the role needed some more focus to really work. I didn't enjoy Chloe Grace Moretz as Carolyn, she makes the angst teen act comes off as very annoying and doesn't feel natural. Jonny Lee Miller and Helena Bonham Carter are solid yet easy to forget thanks to their bland characters.<br/><br/>The film does have some things going for it. I found Barnabas' struggle to adapt to the 1970's very amusing. Arguably the funniest parts of the movie are him trying to fit in with this new society and how his old- fashioned puts people off as well as intrigues them. Angelique's sexual pursuit of Barnabas leads to a few funny exchanges between the two. Even Barnabas' awkward attempts to gain Victoria's love were humorous. As said, if the film put more effort into the comedy then it could have been very funny. The comedy is there but it is in Burton's typical slightly campy and slightly dark style, which if you like then you'll enjoy here.<br/><br/>Visually it is stunning, Tim Burton creates another film that is vividly rich to view thanks to the modern and Gothic elements that are used. The cinematography manages to capture the serene but dark beauty of the area perfectly and the look of the 1970s is nicely realised. The Collins mansion also looks wonderful, the Gothic architecture and gloomy secret passages bring the place to life. The costumes are fantastic too, especially Barnabas' look which conveys the Gothic style of the film just right. <br/><br/>The music was a mixed bag. Danny Elfman's subdued score was effective in certain areas, but also a little lifeless in others. I don't think that Elfman's more quirky styling's fit the film that well. I actually found that some of the music used fit in quite well, song like 'Top of the World' and 'Nights in White Satin' managed to sound authentic thanks to the setting. Even a cameo by Alice Cooper was used effectively and produced some nostalgic fun.<br/><br/>I don't think Dark Shadows is a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, certainly not as bad as people have made it out to be. It is entertaining and is the type of film that is easy to watch at any time. Visually it is wonderful and Johnny Depp is effortlessly engaging. However, it is its limitations that hold it back, the unfocused plot line, shallow characters and the constant genre hopping do nothing but harm the films true intentions. I think this is more of a case of wasted potential than a truly poor effort. With Burton at the helm of what seems like his ideal type of film you cannot help be feel a bit let-down. The shadows are here but they do not hide anything we haven't seen before."

As he acquaints himself with his descendants he tries to save the family business but old ghosts refuse to die.<br/><br/>I can see why this was a box office disappointment, it's visually very good, what else would you expect from Tim Burton.

"Morbius_Fitzgerald","6","0","0","27 May 2013"," Lets be fair here.
","Okay first off, this is NOTHING on ANY of the TV shows. The 1966 version OR the 1991 version. In comparison, this film is a steaming pile of crap. Lets be fair from here on in and judge it on its own. I do hold SOME respect for it because it is how I discovered the others but that's it.<br/><br/>First off, this film is rather confused as to the genre, is it having a joke at the original show or is it a remake? If they seriously thought that we would see the characters as anything but idiots after this guy shows up on the doorstep with white skin, Max Schreck fingernails, an outfit from the 1790's with blood on it an a strange resemblance to one of their ancestors (which the family history is also littered with legend as Pfeifer's character said) do you really expect us to believe that the Collins family can't see that he's a vampire? In that getup it was either that or ""Its Halloween"" and that would be dismissed as soon as he walks by any mirrors or sees any modern technology.<br/><br/>This film is actually a pretty stupid film. Every joke is a consistent ""Oh, Barnabus is a guy from the 1700's, why don't we joke about how he can't get the hang of a 1972 lifestyle?"" Some of these jokes are funny though. The one that is the most memorable is ""Are you stoned or something?"" ""They tried stoning me, my dear. It did not work."" That or his reaction to Alice Cooper.<br/><br/>The acting is, for the most part, better left unmentioned. Johnny Depp is the only performer where I would say ""He could've actually done a great job, all he needed is a better script"" and the worst one is either Eva Green who plays Angelique, the French witch servant girl, with an American accent (What TheFu#ck??) and Helena Bonham Carter who is just plain miscast. Then there is everyone else in between...and the only other memorable one is Jackie Earle Hayley but that's purely because my brother saw Watchmen and kept saying what a great actor he was.<br/><br/>The visual style of Burton is still in this film and remains there throughout. Its probably the best thing about this film. Needless to say the cinematography and the visual effects are amazing.<br/><br/>I also have to respect that they got the gist of the story that ran for 5 years into a small 2 hours. It took this, the first 40 minutes, to sum up 80 20 minute episodes.<br/><br/>The other thing that I think needs a mention is the fact that this is the only version that ends off with closure. Look at the soap that ran for 5 years and has 1245 episodes, that does not have closure. The 1991 version with 12 episodes, that does not end off with closure. If any of you want to see the Collins family actually...""end"" then this is the version for you.<br/><br/>Overall this is a ""dodgy"" film but I can certainly think of worse things to watch."

","I am old enough to remember watching the original ""Dark Shadows"" soap opera, but I was a kid, and so do not remember much about it. Best I recall, they played it straight. But it was, of course, a campy concept, putting Gothic horror elements into a daytime soap. Which brings us to this movie. A lot of movies seem to fall into this trap: they come up with a really good and/or novel premise for the film. And so the beginning of the movie, where they are establishing that reality is really good. But, it is a movie, which means it requires a story arc, climax, etc. superimposed upon the premise. And that is where it all goes, if not bad, it at least goes not as good. That seems to me to be what happened to Dark Shadows. It was still an amusing film, with some interesting actors doing interesting roles. Worth a look, but don't buy it."
"brando647","6","0","0","24 December 2012"," Amusing Movie but Ultimately Unimpressive
","I'm finding more and more difficult to have a coherent opinion on the collaborative movies of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. It's tough to complain about one of their movies because, really, after eight movies togetheryou know what you're getting and you get what you paid for. When I see a trailer for a new Burton/Depp movie, I'm never concerned with whether it's a great movie, what the premise is, who's starring, etc. You know what it's going to be before you ever settle in to watch it: Gothic, eccentric, visually stimulating, and a good chance for weak substance. I've come to a point where I don't bother going to Burton movies in the theater (though I made an exception for ALICE IN WONDERLAND because it was one of the few movies I was interested in seeing in 3D). Now I wait for home video and watch them when the Burton mood strikes. DARK SHADOWS falls easily into that categorya mediocre movie that is just interesting enough that I know I'll go back to it once a year or so. The movie is based on a cheap Gothic soap opera from the '60s that, I'll admit, I've never watched. I was aware of it, and I know it's got a decent cult following. That's the extent of it. It centers on the character of Barnabas Collins (Depp), a man born into a wealthy family of the 1700s who made a mistake of scorning a witch. In return for his refusing her love, she destroys his life and turns him into a vampire and buries him to suffer for eternity. He's unearthed in 1972 and returns to his family estate to find it in ruins. He makes it his mission to revive his family's fishing business and renew their good name, but his past has returned to haunt him.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what I was walking in to with this movie. The original series was played straight but the trailers for the movie set it up as a comedy. DARK SHADOWS is somewhere in between. It tries to retain a serious note to the whole ordeal but stoops to easy laughs as Barnabas adjusts to life in the '70s. There were moments in the movie where I couldn't tell if it was trying to be funny. The movie has its share of laughs but it's nearly outweighed by a disappointingly boring plot. The bulk of the movie is about Barnabas and his jaded former lover/witch Angie Bouchard (Eva Green) and there's a good deal of time spent with Barnabas spurring his family into action to save their good name. Nothing too exciting but the movie is a decent distraction and your average Burton fan will probably be satisfied. There is nothing to brag about here with one exception: the soundtrack. Being that the movie is set in the '70s, we're treated to some great music: Donovan, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper (who makes an appearance in the film), the Moody Blues, etc. The music is the best part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>DARK SHADOWS has a few of the usual Burton players with a few new additions. There is, of course, Depp as Barnabas Collins. Depp has done so many eccentric characters that I forget what ""normal"" Johnny Depp acts like. Barnabas merely fades into the ongoing assault of bizarre characters Depp continues to add to his resume. He's good, as you would expect with Depp, but there is nothing about this character that will stand out over his previous. Helena Bonham Carter is here as the family's live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Hoffman. She's about what you expect from her in another Burton film. Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty strong (and beautiful as ever) as Elizabeth Stoddard, the head of the remaining Collins family, and Jackie Earle Haley is a great little bit of comic relief as the bumbling handyman Willie Loomis. Chloë Grace Moretz is equal parts creepy and disturbingly adult as the moody teen-aged daughter, Carolyn. She goes a little overboard in the ""moody/crazy"" bit but she's great up until the final half hour when her secret is revealed and her dialogue gets lazy. And then there's Eva Green as Angie Bouchard. Green blew me away as Vesper Lynd in the fantastic CASINO ROYALE but, wow, is she cheesy here. I mean, really cheesy. If her character weren't so hot, she'd be outright aggravating with her hamming. It's all right though because it all balances out. As with a lot of recent Burton movies, DARK SHADOWS is wonderful visually and has a crazy fun premise with other-worldly characters but fails to rise above the rank of average."

","Johnny Depp and a vampire movie, that's something to really look forward to now isn't it, but the movie falls short of expectation.<br/><br/>Giving a mean score of five, well i did like the story line, it was supposed to have a classical, dark and comical factor, it is an idea - good on paper but the comical factor seems to lack now and then. <br/><br/>The movie should have had a balanced depth in between the darkness and comedy which wasn't emerged very well. The intensity of a vampire lacked, i expected to hear some dark rhythms of a piano giving it the musical touch, which also lacked, enhanced background effects would have really add to the classical visual effects for the movie. More intensity the humor of every character would have also added more punch.<br/><br/>The end sequence of the movie where the action comes in, should have been more intense, the fight between the witch and the vampire ends to soon, cutting the excitement of the end so suddenly.

","At least it sports the creepy/soapy patina of a Dan Curtis production.<br/><br/>I found myself pleasantly surprised at how I enjoyed the first fifteen minutes or so. I don't mind the mixing and matching of original DS elements, like rolling the Maggie Evans and Victoria Winters characters into one (the original show made little distinction between the two).<br/><br/>The scene of Miss Winters riding a train into Collinsport, coasting through the scenic multicolored forests and seafaring coastline where I grew up and set to the Moody Blues' ""Nights in White Satin"" even made me a bit emotional. Virtually every molecule of the movie screen at that moment made me yearn for and mourn my own long-lost seventies innocence and sense of limitless wonder.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the revisionary remix of Barnabas' vampiric origin story. No spoiler alert: suffice to say, he still screwed a witch, and the witch screwed him and his entire family in return.<br/><br/>I can even accept Barnabas being infatuated with, and quoting from, the book Love Story, just one of the ""Hey, look, it's the SEVENTIES"" nails hammered into the cinematic coffin every few minutes. Barney was always a hopeless romantic, rendering him eternally (as the old ""Marilyn Ross"" Dark Shadows novels' go-to adjective used to sigh) ""melancholy."" I can NOT, however, reconcile myself to a Barnabas who, on first sight of a McDonalds sign, mere moments after his resurrection from a 197-year interment, assumes the giant 'M' stands for the devil Mephistopheles.<br/><br/>Depp's Barnabas is so utterly humorless that such grimace-inducing guffaws are rendered even more out-of-step with the rest of the movie than the centuries-old vampire is with the unfamiliar era in which he finds himself. And the mocking juxtapositions just keep coming: jokes about being stoned (by rocks), or how the Collins have such big balls (parties, not 'nads, a gag AC/DC ran into the ground 30-plus years ago), or how a TV screen featuring the Carpenters performing must be possessed by a tiny songstress (and that's not even the only Carpenters joke).<br/><br/>However. Jettison the recurring gags (the worst of them featuring Barnabas trying to find a comfortable place to sleep, from inside wall cabinets to an empty refrigerator box emptied of Styrofoam peanuts). Also ignore the frequent musical dips into the very worst of the '70s A.M. radio well. Ditch and ignore such foo-hah-hah, and what do you think remains? A movie that isn't all that bad.<br/><br/>For instance, the unkillable four-headed beast that is Burton/Depp/Bonham/Elfman gets the music exactly RIGHT several times, most notably the entire time that Alice Cooper is hanging out at Collinwood.<br/><br/>Also not bad: Collinwood. Maybe even BETTER than the TV show incarnation, which always looked comically tiny and claustrophobic on the inside, especially for a supposedly sprawling mansion. Certainly better than the Collinwood of the 1971 Night of Dark Shadows movie. The new movie mansion's transformation from cobweb-heavy secret passageway-riddled goth dump to shining party pad practically qualifies the old homestead as an uncredited character.<br/><br/>Ditto the way nearby Widow's Hill draws the rocky waves beneath it into the movie so often, in so many ways, that the foreboding and deadly nexus of ocean and jagged stone also becomes an indelible presence in the film, bringing it into the storyline in an all-encompassing way the original TV show never really pulled off past its iconic opening credits sequence.<br/><br/>As for the actors portraying our old DS friends and fiends, it takes a bit of re-thought to accept demure old family matriarch Elizabeth as a meaner, leaner, bitchier and better dressed version of Al Pacino's squeeze in Scarface (both played by Michelle Pfeiffer).<br/><br/>But lazy old Thurston Howell-wannabe Roger Collins maintains his indolence and yellow streak. The dude who played Rorschach in Watchmen plays Barnabas' lackey Willie Loomis. Dude's come a long way since bicycling thru Breaking Away.<br/><br/>The girl superhero from Kick-Ass, Chloe Moretz, well plays entitlement-rich (if penny poor) Carolyn Collins, and even frequent Burton/Depp co-conspirator Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Julia Hoffman holds a similar enough line to her vintage counterpart to make me feel I know who at least some of these darkly tinted doppelangers are supposed to be.<br/><br/>Even young master David Collins remains the handy and bland narrative device that he always was.<br/><br/>The only fly in the casting ointment was the skull-faced pretender was played the witch Angelique. Sure, Lara Parker, and even Lysette Anthony, are hard acts to follow, but I never once believed that our latterday Angelique could ever have enthralled one as lionhearted as Barnabas Collins. In the past OR in 1972.<br/><br/>As for her witchiness, Angelique Version 3.0 is completely outclassed and outdone even by, say, Billie Burke and Mama Cass (what child of the '70s like me could resist a double-barrel pipeload of HR Pufnstuf reference here?).<br/><br/>I'll parcel out some praise for the dialogue. Particularly Barnabas'. Other than a couple of gag lines, he speaks the exact words that someone who's been wading in Barnabas-quotes for 40-plus years would expect and even hope him to speak. And, against all expectation and odds, Johnny Depp reads them in a way that won me over. Even/especially the last ten minutes or so.<br/><br/>There's probably at least a half hour that I would have jettisoned, to keep the feel and look more consistent with the terrific opening sequences. There are no real chuckles in seeing a vampire brush his fangs in a mirror which doesn't reflect him, and bits like that are more torn from Mad Magazine than from the Dan Curtis productions.<br/><br/>But the REST of the movie, the parts not aiming for the juvenile ""humor in a jugular vein"" (to again borrow from Mad), well, it was indeed like a visit with at least the offspring of our old Collinsport crew, if not with the original characters that fanatical devotees like me know and love so well."

","Dark Shadows is directed by Tim Burton and written by John August and Seth Grahame-Smith. It stars Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Chloe Moretz, Eva Green, Bella Heathcote, Jonny Lee Miller, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jackie Earle Haley and Gulliver McGrath. Music is by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel. Based on the TV series of the same name, plot finds Depp as Barnabas Collins, a 200 year old vampire returning to the family mansion in 1972 to find his dysfunctional descendants in residence. With his old nemesis still to deal with and the changing of the times complicating matters still further, it's clear Barnabas has much on his hands.<br/><br/>The Burton and Depp combination, coupled with an American fan base of the original TV series, ensured that Dark Shadows made a decent profit at the box office. However, this does in no way prove to be a guide to the quality of Dark Shadows. It is in truth a muddled mess of a picture, in fact it comes off as a selfish exercise, it's a film that Burton and Depp appear to have made purely for themselves. Self confessed fans of the original TV show, of which only a cult fan base existed any way, there's no denying that Burton pleases the eyes with his visuals and Depp engages in that kooky way from the corner of the market he has cornered, but even their hardiest of fans must be growing a little concerned about the lack of feeling for their audience.<br/><br/>The film actually starts off quite promising, prologue and lead characters in place, a whiff of comedic horror in the air, but once Barnabas is unearthed from his 200 year old grave, it all goes quickly down hill. Not sure if it wants to be funny or creepy, or what pace of scene or tone should follow each set-up, it's weird for all the wrong reasons. The fish out of water premise quickly grows tired and the support characters to Depp's Barnabas are merely making up the numbers. Only Eva Green, who is so delectable she is made for Blu-ray, is able to compete on equal terms with Depp's latest kook, but even she is hindered by the weak screenplay. It's a shame and a waste rolled into one, because as gorgeous as it is to look at, and as sure as there is loving intent, Burton has crafted a disappointing over long mess of a movie that is neither homage or reinvention. 5/10 for Miss Green, the visuals and a snazzy sound track."

","Tim Burton has had his share of the good, and his share of the bad.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows starts interestingly enough, jumping through time and pulling it's lead character along the way, to the modern day(1972).<br/><br/>Depp is the star of the show, and he's excellent here as Barnabus Collins, a fishery tycoon who's family has been devastated by tragedy.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely charming for the first 40 minutes, and then it completely derails.<br/><br/>Burton's story here is fine, but he fails to take advantage of many aspects of his own plot. Example. We get to see Depp venture into the daylight with umbrella and sunglasses in tow. But instead of seeing him interact with townspeople and keep driving this film in the comedy direction it was heading in - we get sloppy interaction between the same characters. None of them are as charming as Depp, and even Depp can't overcome the messy finish that accentuates a then rendered meaningless business struggle and drops the comedy nearly altogether.<br/><br/>I wish something would have called me away from the flat-screen halfway through.<br/><br/>I think Burton made a mistake by basically giving his core of 5-6 characters 99.999999% of the dialog. I also believe that he started all of the characters in the right place, and then really drove them in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>The film was marred by shameless product placement, and hints of sequel story lines, but I don't think I'll be waiting in line for the next Dark Shadows.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes is extremely funny and interesting, but that's only part of what makes the last hour so disappointing.<br/><br/>Positives.

"antun-scurla","6","0","0","5 October 2012"," A film in three parts (and some missing bits)
","I watched this recently on DVD. I generally like Tim Burton's films. His visuals, his casting and his tone are consistently great although his storytelling can be a bit up and down. I didn't know what to expect as the reviews of Dark Shadows have generally been bad yet it seemed to do reasonably well at the box office. Here's my take on it.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a film in three distinct parts. The first (what I like to call The Setup) is great (9/10). It tells Barnabas Collins' back story and introduces the characters that he'll be interacting with in the film. It is well paced, tells us what we need to know and is beautifully detailed. It effectively builds the film's dark tone, it's ""fish out of water"" comedic element as well as establishing the 1970's setting. The Setup is quite long but it doesn't feel it. It is masterful and, before it got to the next phase, had me wondering why the reviews were so bad.<br/><br/>Alas. The next part, The Fallout, which begins with Barnabas' re-taking control of the family business, is a confused mess (3/10). Burton has populated the film with interesting characters and yet he doesn't give us the opportunity to understand them. You consistently feel that there's more behind each character and are expecting to discover it during the course of the film but don't. (There is a series of ""revelations"" in the third part. But these revelations appear completely out of the blue with very tenuous links to information provided earlier and, as a result,seem rather lame). Because of this the characters actually become more distant and detached as the film goes on.<br/><br/>The final part, The Confrontation (?/10), is OK. It has some nice, imaginative touches but since we are now detached, it is meaningless.<br/><br/>I suspect (and would like to believe)that The Fallout was heavily edited and that a lot of the interesting stuff was left on the cutting room floor. Too much screen time is devoted to altercations between Barnabas and Angelique in which plot points related to their relationship are reinforced ad nauseum. Insufficient time is spent on Barnabas' relationship with Victoria and there are a number of scenes (e.g. Barnabas/Carolyn talking about ""modern women"" and Barnabas/David outside the cloakroom) that feel as though they should have lead to something ""meatier"" but just hang there, detached. The only sub-plot that is adequately explored is Barnabas/Dr. Hoffman and the reasons for that are somewhat cynically obvious once you've seen the film.<br/><br/>No wonder so many people are disappointed (me included). The film delivers so much in The Set-up, then loses all momentum in The Fallout, leading to a meaningless Confrontation. I'd like to believe that an executive decision was made to cut perhaps a 180 minute film to a more acceptable 113 min. Either that or Tim Burton just got lazy and bored after a masterful introduction."

","When Dark Shadows was an afternoon staple on TV in the 60s, the character of Barnabas Collins exuded a sense of pathos and doom. Jump ahead to the Tim Burton film and pathos is replaced by slap stick and special effects, which in a remake of a three stooges film might not be so bad, but not here. With the exceptional Johnny Depp teaming yet again with Burton, and joined by a significant cast of Michelle Pffifer, Burton's wife Helena Bonham-Carter, and Eva Green among other very excellent character actors, the story of a vampire and a witch failed to have merit worthy of some significant earlier Burton/Depp encounters. What is wrong is this was never a funny story to begin with, and translated into the sexualized humor of today, Dark Shadows comes forth as sleazy innuendo instead of witty and droll. The kinds of monster creatures from werewolf to witch to vampire to ghostly spectra permit the makeup department and costumer full opportunity to flex, but with a 70s sound track that included Alice Cooper's sync performance, the story, music, and dressing are never one to draw the audience's attention and hold it. <br/><br/>People like Tim Burton's whimsy and fantastical gadgets which are delights in all his films, and Dark Shadows is not the exception, but it is not enough. Depp's Barnabas is cartoonish and aptly formal as an 18th c. gentleman, but perhaps the fangs genre is tired of yet another film in this vein, (yes, pun intended). The moral of the story - family is everything and love endures is warm and fuzzy, but this is not the film in which to preach. Not one of Burton's better film efforts, sadly, nor, is it even in the vampire Gothic class of camp."

I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny ""Death Becomes Her"" as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not.

","Tim Burton is not as seriously committed as I'd like, someone with an intuitive grasp for life. Or rather, he does it badly when he tries to be (serious). And that is reflected in the long arcs of his films (right down to his produced Nightmare), almost without exception poor and slapdash. He does not have what it takes to sustain story-motion, so we simply move in his films from one visual contraption to the next. He has two talents: one is to build those contraptions, and his other gift is for comedy, both short-term effects. Ed Wood is his best, because it is about his own experience and love of doing what he does, and having ghoulish fun irrespective of contraptions working or not. That was the long arc.<br/><br/>This is business as usual. It's one of his most poorly written, to the point that a long arc is practically nonexistent. And it goes to illustrate why he doesn't get it. He builds characters the way he builds an effect, appealing to look at and with a few interesting tics. In order for the overall world to have convincing motion though, you have to understand the build of forces that move it, gravity instead of simply showing the fall.<br/><br/>And we are simply unsure here of the reach of what forces the characters can leverage inside the world of the film. One is revealed at the last moment to be a werewolf, useless. Our witch is a shrewd actress for the entire film, and it's out of character for her to step out of character at the crucial moment. The vampire can hypnotize. M'kay.<br/><br/>The contraption is built from parts that have appealing dissonance, vampire lore + Nixon's Woodstock America + the fishing business. And in short spurts, the comedy is the best he has done in a long time. <br/><br/>It's a lot of fun to watch this tinkertoy mimic motion for a minute, but it doesn't go anywhere. There is no mechanism. <br/><br/>There is a scene with Johnny Depp as the ancient vampire accidentally hitting random keys in a synth that make goofy sounds that counterpoint his mournful ruminations. Burton works a bit like this. He can tinker with sound, but he has no clue how to synthesize.<br/><br/>And it's a shame about Depp, because he has also segued in that complacent Burton-mode of simply tinkering a bit with a persona, and he can support so much more."

","When I heard that Tim Burton had met again with Johnny Depp to create the film Dark Shadows I could not help thinking that I would give them my confidence to that couple for one last time since in their latest films together (Alice in wonderland, Swenney Todd, Charlie and the chocolate factory) they have not done more than leave us dissatisfied.<br/><br/>When the film begins, it seems that Burton has created a story of love and terror that seems to be real promising. The film begins when by a series of situations of jealousy and impossible loves the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) curse Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) in order to turn him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin where he is forced to spend a long time locked. All goes well until the vampire Barnabas Collins is released from the coffin and appears in a total different world to where he lived and must adapt to the new customs from the 70s and also has to fight to rescue from the misery the family business while living with all members who now inhabit what was once his home, like Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), who enters as an important figure in the development of the plot, with a good performance by Carter, but Burton could have done a better job developing this character by the fact that sometimes appears like a less important character. One problem with the film is that the way in which Burton reveals the development of the movie, becomes really boring, full of clichés and old and predictable jokes, that let the spectator notes that a story of vampires trying to do a combination with terror, comedy and drama is something that in the Burton's universe is not very profitable. <br/><br/>Depp presents a performance where is notable that the exaggeration of mimicry and the peculiar form of walking are the characteristic features in every single one of his latest movies and he creates a character of Barnabas Collins that is not credible. Not everything in this movie is below expected, the role of Michelle Pfeiffer as the Collins house matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, is so good that is only surpassed by the performance of Eva Green as the antagonist of the story that is the best thing of the movie, Eva Green creates a fantastic Villain that has a bizarre way to show her love, full of sensuality, malice and hate to every person who stands in their way. One more time, in a film that is predictable, and there is a lack of intriguing moments. Where the best thing is the fabulous performance by Eva Green and Michelle Pfeiffer. Burton leaves us waiting to much of this film."

","Dark Shadows is a Tim Burton movie that features Johhny Depp as Barnabas Collins. The movie is a spin off of the 1970s TV soap opera of the same name. In the film, Barnabas is a vampire who was buried alive because he spurned the love of a witch and she cursed him to the life of a vampire and then had him buried alive. A site excavation digs up Barnabas Collins' casket and he is set free nearly 200 years after his burial.<br/><br/>200 years before, Collins was a rich playboy who basically owned the town of Collinsworth. Maine and lived in a huge mansion called Collinwood. Now, the last of his remaining family live in the mansion. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Elizabeth Collins Stoddard who is the mother and runs the remains of the family fishing business. She has a daughter Naomi and a brother Roger and a nephew named David. Pfeiffer does an outstanding job in her role...she is strong, purposeful and vigilant.<br/><br/>There is a love story between Barnabas Collins and Victoria Winters (played by Bella Heathcote). Heathcote is a reincarnation of Barnabas Collins' true love from 200 years ago, Josette DuPres. In Dark Shadows, both Victoria Winters and young David Collins can talk to or see ghosts and that helps them gain advantage in some situations.<br/><br/>The plot surrounds Collins trying to restore his family business and honor while the witch, Angelique Bouchard (played by Eva Green) tries to maintain her power over the town and over Barnabas himself. Without her love requited, Bouchard goes on a string of dirty deeds to undue Collins, while simultaneously trying to get him to love her.<br/><br/>The movie is typical Tim Burton, at times very dark and bizarre and at times humorous and lively. One of Burton's favorites, Helena Bonham Carter plays the drunken Dr. Julia Hoffman who is trying to steal Barnabas' blood so that she can have immortality.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Depp and the rest of the cast is strong and he pretty much carries the plot line. It is hard to envision the film being as good with anyone else in the role of Collins. Johnny Depp plays it well and his facial expressions alone add depth and hilarity to the film.<br/><br/>I give this film a Bruno Wang 3.5 out of 5 stars. It is good entertainment for the roughly 2 hours of cinema. Don't expect a chuckle- fest, this is Tim Burton. The movie is just as twisted as it is funny. Go out and enjoy!"
"geodrake-71-627198","5","0","0","19 June 2012"," Dark shadows with nothing to hide.
","There was a time when Tim Burton films were pretty much guaranteed to be worth viewing. The same used to be true about films starring Johnny Depp. Combine the two and you had cinematic gold. Since those days, both have been involved with titles that can charitably be described as mediocre. As a result, when I found out about 'Dark Shadows' I wasn't as excited by the news as I once would have been. <br/><br/>Originally, 'Dark Shadows' was a U.S. daytime soap featuring various supernatural characters and story lines. Running for over 1200 episodes between 1966 and 1971, it garnered a cult following.<br/><br/>The T.V. series, often described as a Gothic soap, was full of convoluted story arcs that involved a large cast, magic and even time travel. It was a sense of this that the screenwriters were trying to give by making the plot of the movie overly complex and full of so many characters. This succeeds in part, however there was a lot to follow during the 113 minutes, and not enough reward for doing so. None of the sub plots contributed much to the overall story and a simpler screenplay would have been welcome. Yes, this would have negated the soap opera feel that was being aimed at, but is this meant to be a homage for 'Dark Shadows' fans, or a Hollywood movie which the average punter can access and enjoy? For my money it fell between those two stools.<br/><br/>Another problem is that apart from Barnabas and to a lesser extent Angelique, characters have so little screen-time or memorable actions that they almost seem part of the set rather than actual people. The camera remains relentlessly on Depp, to the point that it was in danger of becoming a vanity project. Depp has said he was 'obsessed' by the series whilst growing up, and he was instrumental in bringing Burton aboard the project. He obviously relishes the chance to play Barnabas, and his enjoyment of the part does come across in his performance. Inspirations for Depp's portrayal of Barnabas came from Max Schrek as the vampire in 1922's 'Nosferatu' and Jonathan Frid who played Barnabas in the series. Frid, and a couple of other actors from the T.V. show had cameos as party guests in the movie, which was Frid's last screen appearance as he died shortly after. <br/><br/>Barnabas is a novel character, and the premise of the plot is an interesting one. Not enough is made of the battle between his two natures; a human who cares about his family and vampire who craves nourishment. He is just described as a good man who does bad things (I.E. kill people and drink their blood) because of the curse. From what I understand there was a lot more to the T.V. Barnabas, he couldn't be described as a good man compelled to do evil. If the part in the movie had been made darker, there would have been more interest for viewers. As it stands Barnabas on the big screen is shallow whilst other characters are gossamer thin. <br/><br/>Introducing humour to the plot was an unwise decision in my opinion. The series was not comical, putting a strong humorous vein into the movie gives the idea that it is meant to be a loving parody for those 'in the know' rather than an actual adaptation for the general cinema goer. Gags are not great, Barnabas tearing apart the T.V. to try and reveal the 'tiny songstress' in a scene that could come from any 'character out of time-period' plot is as funny as it gets. Alice Cooper has a cameo performing at a Ball thrown by the Collins to ingratiate themselves to the townspeople. Naturally Barnabas thinks Cooper is 'The ugliest woman I have ever seen'.<br/><br/>Creation of a Gothic atmosphere through set design and cinematography is pleasing; this is Burton's forte after all. The Production Designer; Editor; Costume Designer and film score composer (the prolific Danny Elfman) have all worked with Burton before so know how to deliver his vision. <br/><br/>Due to its self indulgent nature that is neither a straight big screen revival, nor an out and out parody; 'Dark Shadows' is not a satisfying experience. There are things to enjoy here, particularly for hardcore Depp and Burton fans. Overall though, I wish the film had more depth and bite (if you'll pardon the pun)."
"The-Sarkologist","6","0","0","5 June 2012"," A mix between the Adams Family and Death Becomes Her
","Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, what could really be all that wrong with this movie? Nothing really, though I would not put it at the top of my all time favourite Tim Burton movie (that honour goes to Alice in Wonderland) but this movie pretty much has everything that you would expect from a Tim Burton offering. It is creepy but in a very cartoony sort of way, and the characters themselves are interesting. For instance, Barnabas Collins is a vampire, and while he will act occasionally like a vampire, he is not the antagonist of the film, he is the protagonist.<br/><br/>To me Dark Shadows seems to be a mix of a number of movies, specifically Death Becomes Her and the Adams Family, and one would initially think that this is simply an original movie that has borrowed from others that have come beforehand until you discover that there was an old 60s television series called Dark Shadows that pretty much has the same characters (though I had no seen it nor heard of it until I read up on this film).<br/><br/>The story is about a boy who as a teenager has an affair with one of the scullery maids, but refuses to love her. I guess it has a lot to do with the nature of 18th century American society that the upper classes and the lower classes generally do not mix. In a way it is quite insightful of the writers considering, despite being before slavery was abolished, the so call land of opportunity still had significant class divides. In a way one did not marry below their status, and in many was that is still the case. People who live in the Hamptons do not really mix with people from the Bronx or from Queens. Okay, it is not as strict as it once was, but the upper classes still hide away in their gated communities, one one really does not want to speculate about what goes on behind those gates.<br/><br/>Getting back to the film, the tone is set pretty much from the beginning when a young Angelique, standing on Southhampton docks, looks admirably up at Barnabas but her mother tells her that she is cannot marry above her class, it is just not permitted. However, Barnabas uses her for his own pleasure, but refuses to love her, and thus the fun begins. As one can expect from a woman scorned, Angelique turns to the dark arts and curses the Collins family, kills Barnabas' bride, and then curses him to become a vampire, before turning the entire town together.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 1970 and Barnabas' coffin is uncovered and he is released into a new world. Obviously there is the humorous anecdotes of the pre-industrial person exploring a technologically advance society, however something tells me that such people would probably quickly work out that the bitumen strip that they come across is actually a road. While they may only have recently began using bitumen for roads, I do suspect that they did have roads back in the 18th century (albeit poorly maintained dirt ones).<br/><br/>So, this is a fun an enjoyable movie done in a style that only Tim Burton can do. Some have said that it is more of a cross between Caroline and Beetlejuice, but once again I will have to disagree, because I saw a lot more of the Adams Family and Death Becomes Her in this film than what I saw in the other two Burton movies. Burton's style generally does not change, though we must admit that Mars Attacks is not in a similar vein to many of his other movies, but it is still quite cartoony, and somewhat farcical."

Even though I haven't seen the original series, I am a Burton fan and I do believe the man will always stay true to himself: he certainly knows how to create a mood, you've got to give it to him. And he certainly knows how to bring the best out of Johnny Depp. <br/><br/>Unlike other reviewers, I totally accept the mix of early 1970's and 18th century 'Gothica'. Both periods intertwine perfectly. Clichés as they may be, the makeup, costumes and recurring 70's themes (rock music, weed, war, peace) seemed very appropriate and didn't clash at all with that gorgeous old mansion. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is just perfect; beside Elfman's usual touch, A Theme From Summer Palace and The Carpenters' Top of the World for example made me smile. There is a lot of warmth and nostalgia in this movie, as opposed to the cold, Gothic scenes from Barnabas' past. <br/><br/>The woman who plays Victoria/Josette, Isabella Heathcote, namely a TV actress...well, she is definitely the star of every scene she's in. Her unusual beauty and facial expressions tell me she's going to be a big star in no time. Maybe it's because I don't like Eva Green, but I think she was miscast as Angelique..and I think Helena Bonham Carter and Michelle Pfeiffer should have switched roles, that would have given their respective characters more..spice and credibility. <br/><br/>There were too many details given out in a haste, in order to summarize a series in a single feature film, but instead of making the latter fast-paced this simply leaves us puzzled, and asking for more. Plot holes may be allowed in series because there is always room to fill them later and add interesting twists, but in a movie it is not advisable. <br/><br/>The sex scene was as ridiculous as Johnny Depp's musical act in Alice in Wonderland. But both suicide/cliff scenes were gorgeous to look at and serve as a reminder that Burton hasn't lost his touch. <br/><br/>See it for the fun of it, it's real eye candy, and an entertaining story, but don't expect a masterpiece of depth and drama."

Tim Burton Returns in a very very bad movie , i thought it would be better with Johnny Depp on board . am still mad at them both for doing such a bad movie , the only good thing in this movie ( which could be boring to others ) is the music and songs for the early 70th , i really enjoyed it and this with the acting of Johnny Depp Is the only reason i rate this movie 6 out of 10 , without them (music & Depp) I could of rated this movies with a solid 4 or 3 maximum ... wait till it is on DVD or go to theater if you feel bored and want to do anything but sitting home ."

","""Dark Shadows"" is based on the 1966-1971 television series that director Tim Burton was a fan of. Here it becomes a mildly amusing mix of horror, fantasy and comedy. Barnabus Collins becomes a vampire under the spell of a witch and is buried for 200 years. He's accidentally set free and returns to his ancestral family home. Following the dramatic prologue, the film becomes a comedy set in 1972, one year after the television series ended. The Collins family is dysfunctional, which makes for some good comic moments. I've never seen any episodes of the original television series, however, I feel the film would have worked more effectively with a darker, more serious tone. Burton is likely going for popular appeal here. Introducing an old television series to a new generation. Worth a look for Tim Burton fans."

","I give this movie an 8, but if I could rate more discreetly I'd give it a 7.8...just under that. When I viewed the trailers, and I must have viewed nearly all of them and saw the TV adverts I was afraid that Burton and Depp had jumped the shark with too much comedy. They didn't, although there are a few scenes that go over the top. In general the tone is respectful to the original soap while managing to poke a bit of fun at itself.<br/><br/>They've taken some license with the original plot, but not in a way that detracts I think. Certainly, the movie successfully explores and exploits the sudden jump from 18th century to the 20th in a way that the original never thought to.<br/><br/>It moves a bit slowly at times, and there are some actors that are underused. Chloe Moritz and Helena Bohnam Carter could have been used more effectively even without expanding their parts, but by simply making them more integral to the plot.<br/><br/>I don't think I'm spoiling anything by mentioning the well advertised cameos of the original stars, but I will say that their appearance was much too brief...fleeting even.<br/><br/>On balance, if the movie performs well and they decide to make a sequel, I'm on board."

","Tim Burton is a great director. And, with Johnny Depp in the lead role, Tim Burton can make a good movie. Examples of this are ""Edwards Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". It is also my opinion, as well as the majority of people I've talked to, that Tim Burton is at his worst when he re-imagines things. Examples of this are ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", and ""Alice in Wonderland"". Factoring this in, I was convinced that ""Dark Shadows"" was going to be one of the worst movies of the year. Was I right? Eh...I guess?<br/><br/>While I don't think that the movie is terrible, it's no ""Sweeney Todd"". Let's get all the good in the movie out of the way first: Johnny Depp. Yes, I've yet to see a movie where I didn't enjoy the guy. He commits a lot to his roles, which really shows here. He had me laughing pretty hard. The supporting cast is fine, even if Eva Green does tend to overact a bit in a few scenes. Another plus to the movie is the scenery. Even the bad Tim Burton movies have this going for them. The cinematography and set pieces are grand and full of energy.<br/><br/>I am no fan of the ""Dark Shadows"" t.v. show; I haven't seen a single episode. Before I saw the film, I saw a lot of uproar about how it tries to cram too many of the main points of the show into an approx. 2 hour movie. And though I've never seen the show, even I could see that the movie felt too bloated and self indulgent.<br/><br/>Another big problem with the film is the tone. It seems to me that Burton was trying to make this one a comedy, and for awhile, I believed him. The jokes hit hard and were funny! But when you mix those scenes with Depp suddenly murdering a bunch of hippies around the campfire, that just clashes with the lighthearted goofiness that Burton is hoping to make with the movie.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I came home and was prepared to give the movie a solid 6 out of 10. Just slightly above average, just because I did have a good time with the flick. But a few hours later, I didn't remember too much of it. The movie is sort of like cinema hypnosis; you are having a pretty good time, but once you've left the theater, the spell is broken and you don't remember jack squat. And that's the movie's biggest crime: it's so forgettable. Even the bad Tim Burton movies I remember; I may not have enjoyed them, but they left some sort of impact on me. And this just didn't. Only the biggest devotes of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp should flock to the theaters for this one...or they should just see ""The Avengers"" again."

","Fun. Funny. Very retro. Depp doing Depp at his best! And surprisingly a genuinely sound storyline.<br/><br/>If you were born too late to enjoy the spoofy, silly but a little bit creepy late 60's daytime soap opera on which this film is based, you are probably too busy seeing The Avengers for the third time this month. This movie is not for you. But it could be. TMG thinks this film can play to all generations if they give it a chance. Most will not. Too bad.<br/><br/>To a sharp eye, this movie has many elements of Edward Scissorhands (1990). Scissorhands was the movie that has defined Depp's career, perfected his quirky mannerisms and solidified his creative acting style. It is in the TMG Movie Hall of Fame. Dark Shadows won't make the Hall of Fame, but it is a solid reprise nonetheless.<br/><br/>What is appealing is that the screenwriters mixed a dumb soap opera with genuine comedy largely built around a vampire (always popular) with the modern day surprises after being buried for 200 years (196 to be exact). It has that Austin Powers fun about it. Pfeifer and Green added the sultry and hot spice while Jackie Earle Haley (remember Little Children from 1990?) added a touch of creepy authenticity (a bit Marty Feldman like from Young Frankenstein (1974) for a very mild, spooky feel.<br/><br/>My real disappointment, perhaps more of a concern, is for little Chloe Moretz. Chloe is a hugely talented young girl but playing a ""whore child"" may be fearfully predictive of what trouble lies ahead for her in real life. She needs to do play some softer roles and quit hanging around amoral types like Nic Cage. (Kick Ass 2010) Simply adding ""Grace"" as your middle stage name is not going to help. Mark TMG words, Chloe will be the next Hollywood tragedy at her current rate.<br/><br/>Give Dark Shadows a try. It is really a light comedy and truly entertaining."

","I'm a big fan of Burton, Depp, & Bonham. But this excuse for a movie was bad and fairly confusing. The acting was top notch, the cast was amazing & the effects were tremendous. But the story/plot was weak, the accent (I did not understand 25% of what they were saying) and the subtleness was just...awful. I didn't expect that much 'adult humor' considering that it was a PG - 13 movie. My brother had me answering tons of questions related to the 'sexy time' scenes (as he had called them).<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz did a great job, but it was like she was trying to be a teenage prostitute or something. Her character was pretty lame. Helena Bonham Carter - like always - Oscar Worthy, but her character in the movie was a tad confusing. Her desire to become immortal because of beauty was a little bit eccentric and not believable. The only fairly good character was Michelle Pfeiffer as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Her presence was a huge hit for me. It made me like the movie even more. <br/><br/>Anyways, the movie was alright at its best. If it wasn't for the last 20 minutes of the movie, I would've gave it a 3 stars."

","I absolutely have to have this movie on DVD! Greatly daring I went to the first showing today, which was mid-morning, terrified it would be as campy as the trailers. Not to mention I read the review in my local paper that labeled the film a 'comedy'.<br/><br/>Was I ever pleasantly surprised! The new movie is a lovely blend of drama, dark humor, favorite elements from the original series, some unexpected twists, and horror. Yes, there are a couple of 'over the top' scenes but I didn't find them distracting from the over all plot.<br/><br/>Four actors from the original series made cameos - J. Frid, D. Selby, K.L. Scott and L. Parker. Look for them in the happening scene.<br/><br/>My only argument is that in the very beginning - Barnabas is shown as an only child. How could the Collins family have survived? Most important to remember about the movie is the theme: Family is everything. It is carried through out the entire film.<br/><br/>Otherwise, a must see for fans of either the 1960's or 1990's series. Johnny Depp is a fan of the series and the way he plays the character shows that.<br/><br/>The ending was interesting and sort of upbeat. I will not ruin it for those who have not seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>There are many other elements typical for the time period between the hippies in the minivan, the habits of Dr. Hoffman, the lava lamp, and music. While modern audiences who did not live through the early 1970's may find them comedic, they are a clear reminder of where our country once was before cell phones, computers, and the Internet."

","It's not that bored. It's just because I've never watch the original one on TV before. It's quite funny, but not scary. It helps relax a bit. It's not what I've expected, the story didn't give enough details, and I can't understand why Carolyn Stoddard suddenly becomes a werewolf, why others hate Collins' family, and why the doctor didn't died at the end but the others dead. But Johnny Depp, actor and actress do well all the time. I think the main problem is story expression methods. It can't bring out the feel of a comedy or vampire movie. I can just say that I love the costumes, their make-up, and the scene. I think that are the most impressive things. <br/><br/>hum... I watch it because of Johnny Depp, he is just amazing.

","OK, so I was reading various reviews and I don't think they're the best. Not just because I liked the movie, but most of those reviews were ripe with grammar and spelling errors. It was not ""the worst movie of all time"" as one dubbed it. I think it probably should'E been billed as more of an action-fantasy, rather than comedy. It had silly, fun parts, as expected from Johnny Depp, and more serious parts, as expected from Tim Burton. It wasn't the greatest movie ever, I do wish they had gone in depth a little more to some characters, but it was still a good movie. Overall, it was a movie worth seeing, so don't listen to harsh worded reviews that aren't that great. At least see the movie, even if you hate it, Johnny Depp's antics are still fun."
"zzoaozz","9","3","9","13 May 2012"," A Gothic Drama Not A Horror Comedy
","First and foremost, if you are thinking of seeing this film and expecting a horror comedy, you are going to be sadly disappointed. This movie is not a comedy at all though it does have a few humorous moments. It is not a horror movie even though it has a vampire and he does kill victims and drink their blood. This is instead a very good Gothic drama.<br/><br/>If you are a huge fan of the Dark Shadows TV series and want to see a big screen version of your beloved soap opera, you will most likely be a little disappointed by the amount the characters and back story were changed. Everyone's history and nature has been thoroughly changed Barnabus, Victoria, Caroline, Angelique, I mean everyone.<br/><br/>If you are going to see it just because it is a Tim Burton movie, you should know it is closer to Sleepy Hollow than any of his other movies. It takes itself seriously and the mood is very melodramatic. The acting might seem over the top in another setting but it is actually a good match for the period feeling of the setting. <br/><br/>The music is fantastic, actual 70's rock. I happen to be a fan of Alice Cooper and his appearance and performance was just a little extra icing on an already tasty piece of cake. <br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining and something different which is rather hard to come by here lately."
"Aly200","2","2","5","2 August 2012"," Hilariously Entertaining
","If anyone can take the original 1960s-1970s Gothic soap opera and turn it into a comical parody, it can only be Tim Burton. This film and its original series tells the story of aristocratic playboy Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp in the film, the late Jonathan Frid in the original series) who was cursed to be a vampire by his jealous former lover, Angelique who is a witch (Eva Green in the film, Lara Parker in the series). After being buried alive for 200 years, he is awakened by construction workers and he heads back to his former home Collinwood. Upon arrival he meets his dysfunctional descendants; Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), her daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), Elizabeth's brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller) and his son David. Also there are David and Carolyn's governess, Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcoate)and Elizabeth's psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham-Carter). This film is a mixture of dark humor and an interesting characters. Depp as Barnabas is a mix of his odd humor, comedy and cheesy vampire appearance, but he generates plenty of laughs throughout. Michelle is a welcome matronly figure with a dark secret that she has to hide from everyone in Collinsport. Heathcoate as the troubled governess is a welcome among the mix of odd characters, but she is not what she appears to be on the exterior. If you appreciate a good laugh then see 'Dark Shadows.'"
"jsmfineart","8","2","5","1 June 2012"," Better on second viewing!
","I watched this movie on opening weekend and thought the design was amazing as always for a Tim Burton movie. Johnny Depp was amazing as a vampire, as expected. These two have a chemistry and their own visual and theatrical vocabulary that they have cultivated over the many projects they have worked on together. The other actors were also well cast and believable. But on the first viewing I was sort of let down by the ending and by the general tone of the film. It seemed to be too light as compared to the bits and pieces I remember glimpsing on daytime TV when it was in reruns in the early 80s. My mother loved the show when it originally aired so Dark Shadows was a reference that has seemed to be floating around my whole life. So although I enjoyed it the first time, I tended to agree with the reviewers that said something was missing.<br/><br/>However, I went to see it again as a matinée midweek recently and my experience was much different. (It is a great matinée film...with these great dramatic monster and maiden hero shots at the beginning and end.) In the interim, I had watched almost every episode of the old show that has been uploaded on Netflix and so this time I could appreciate all the analogs from the show to the movie...and this made all the difference! Because the fact is that it's all there from the original, just reflected or refracted through the mind of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. And on seeing it the second time, I think it really works! Rather than being a remake or a homage, it is its own entity but with all the characters and places referenced in some ways and changed in others to fit the story. Now, some purists who only want the Dan Curtis version will never like this movie. But I say give it a second chance if you felt so-so after the first viewing. We have the original, melodramatic version which is brilliant and now we have this movie, which is another take that in time will be viewed as brilliant in its own right. In watching the old show, there is a mounting frustration in myself as a person of the 21st century that screams out to Barnabas to just reveal himself for what he is and let others deal with it. Most of his problems come from trying to hide who he is from everyone. Burton must have felt this too, especially given his filmic crusade to liberate and celebrate the ""others"" of our society, because the Barnabas in this movie is a vampire, accepts it and gets on with life. This joie de vie for being undead gives Depp's Barnabas a great energy and makes this movie a fun ride that I will no doubt watch many more times once I have the DVD. I even found the ending more acceptable the second time. I guess just as with all Burton films, this one too will fit better with wear."
"stvpetro10","6","2","5","28 May 2012"," Am I the only one who liked this?
","I have to say, after reading all of the user reviews, it seems like this movie started some sort of angry mob to chase Tim Burton out of film making for good. Seems to me everyone hated this film which apparently lacked depth, storytelling, interest and many other things. However, I feel Dark Shadows was at least an improvement over the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland remakes Burton has force-fed us in the past.<br/><br/>That may not sound like a great recommendation, and it's certainly not to suggest this film ranks anywhere near the Burton genius of Big Fish, but I felt the movie was genuinely entertaining to say the least. Unlike my fellow user reviewers, I felt the awkward combination of darkness and comedy was quite refreshing. Just as this movie seems to settle into gentle family comedy, somebody gets randomly murdered and you're left with that great, awkward feeling where you want to laugh but somehow know it's morally wrong somehow. Truly such a laugh is guaranteed in a viewing of Dark Shadows as many of the serious moments come completely out of left field and often left me confused, but amused as well. The genre-bending nature of the film often kept me interested, as the narrative was a far cry from the goofy comedy promised by the trailer.<br/><br/>That being said, it is hard to deny there are significant flaws here. The story has some random, gaping plot holes and several 'deus ex machina' style resolutions to many of the central conflicts, but that almost makes it more endearing and satirical of the soap opera style the story is derived from. Truth be told, I've never seen the soap opera, but my mother assures me it was not funny; rather, it was often creepy. Be that as it may, Dark Shadows is enjoyable enough for a night at the movies, and certainly worth the time contrary to how boring some apparently find it. Quite frankly, this is an entertaining movie you can have fun with and not think too hard about if you don't want to. At the same time, if you enjoy running comparisons to old soap operas and enjoying campy, self-reflexive film making, there's room for that too."

","Being a fan of the original TV series, it was exciting to hear the very talented Johnny Depp and visionary director, Tim Burton, a man known for his ability to create new worlds on the screen (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Nightmare Before Christmas""), it was only expected the Gothic source material would be just a perfect match. A look at the prospective cast members, coupled with the craze for vampire / magic in films, and this was going to be an explosive mix.<br/><br/>Instead, the fizzle is not there, in a gorgeous film with beautiful art direction and costumes, very talented performers such as Eva Green, in a terrific turn as Angelique and Michelle Pfieffer as the Collins matriarch. Unfortunately, Depp is a bit too weird this time, overacting, and well, Bonham-Carter has proved herself so many times before, but this time, there needs to be more than just uncanny resemblance to the original actress in the series. ""Dark Shadows"" just doesn't work beyond its great look.<br/><br/>There is a hint of a outline here, based on some of the source material, but the script is poorly written, and the actors can't really deliver if they don't have much to work with. Somehow, there are mentions of dark magic, curses, broken hearts (literally), vampires, love, hatred, ambition, and check... werewolves, but it never goes beyond these all being items on a checklist.<br/><br/>It is sad because we want it to work, and it could have worked had better hands been utilized such as a more appropriate director and a script doctor. We have recent examples of material that has been revived and adapted with amazing results: ""Star Trek"", ""The Avengers"", ""Planet of The Apes"", etc. Hopefully, someone will take a stab at this again and do it justice for ""Dark Shadows"" has remained alive in the hearts of many because it is terrific material.

","Dark Shadows (2012) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Tim Burton's updating of the TV series features Johnny Depp playing vampire Barnabas Collins who after nearly two-hundred years underground is dug up where he returns to his family estate (via 1972) and plans on returning the Collins name back to the top. The only problem is that his old enemy, the witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), plans to keep his curse unless he agrees to love her. I've heard several people compare this to the earlier works of Burton and I'd have to agree because after years of delivering some fine films I think the director fell back on his old method that is more style that substance. Visually and technically DARK SHADOWS is a masterpiece but there's so little here to connect to that it's easy to see why so many people are leaving the theater disappointed. I'm not overly familiar with the original show, hated the first movie and haven't seen the second one. With that said, I'm not sure how ""fans"" of them will react to this here so I'm not even going to try and compare everything. For the most part Burton has delivered a truly incredible looking film. The sets, costume design and most of the special effects are terrific looking and I'm glad that the director kept the dark tone. The TV ads and trailers have shown the worst of the film and that's the failed comedy. There are a lot of jokes that really don't make one laugh, although some of them are charming in a very childish way. The jokes that do work basically come from Depp's performance as he's able to pull off the fish-out-of-water routine and especially the jokes about Alice Cooper (who performs a couple songs). Depp nails the part pretty well but at the same time you have to wonder why such a talented actor appears in this stuff. Michelle Pfeiffer was back and it was great seeing her. She too delivers a fine performance but the screenplay does very little for her character. The same is true for Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley. It was fun seeing Christopher Lee in his small part as well as Jonathan Frid's cameo. Chloe Grace Moretz steals the film as the young woman with a few secrets of her own. On the whole DARK SHADOWS is a great film to look at and the performances are good but with such a distant screenplay and no characters to really care for, the film in the end just doesn't come together."

","i'll start by saying i've never seen any of the original series, or the other film. i have seen a lot of people on the boards saying that people who were not a fan of the series would enjoy the film, and that just the nit-picky fans were the people who disliked it. i really like tim burton's films, and i went in expecting something along the lines of his Gothic-eqse stuff. the film started out with what i thought would be an interesting story line, but i felt like it just sort of continued downhill from there. i didn't care for the character of barnabas, he came off rather horny and awful. they keep saying that he doesn't love 'angie' but he sleeps with her. that part of it just made me uncomfortable. he was supposed to be in love with victoria/josette but he's going around sleeping with the witch he's supposed to hate. everything moved rather fast, i don't know if this is because they were trying to fit in a bunch of story lines from the series, but it just made for a jumbled film. also caroline, why is she a werewolf? this threw me for a loop when it comes out at the very end of the film. i mean there are no hints throughout the film and then BAM werewolf. she also was this weirdly over-sexualized teenager which again made me rather uncomfortable, mostly because she didn't have anyone for this to play off too, she was only surrounded by her family. it didn't come off as a comedy, i didn't laugh once, and didn't really see any places where other people would laugh. admittedly i went to a showing and there were maybe ten other people in the theatre with me, which felt odd considering this was the only showing before it opens today (friday the 11th of may). i don't think it's the sort of film i'd recommend to anyone, it was a very 'all over the place' film, and the story lines didn't have enough chance to develop. the only thing i really did like about the film was victoria, and her back story seemed fairly interesting though i would have liked to learn more. honestly i think that's what this film needed, to pick out fewer plots to deal with and focus on the ones it picks. i think it would probably work nicely as a TV series, and i'm eager to get my hands on it."

","I've never seen the original series so I've nothing to compare this adaption to, meaning this review is based on what I witnessed in the cinema. <br/><br/>Whatever they were in the past, I liked the characters in this film. The family had potential to be interesting, and they WERE interesting in the first twenty minutes or so. Depp gave a great performance as a vampire this time around. The look was beautiful, the camera work lovely, the costumes flawless. The special effects were a little wonky, but it's Burton and I don't expect anything else. The music was fun (especially the end credits song). The acting was appropriately over-dramatic and I enjoyed it muchly. Then Eva Green showed up and everything fell apart.<br/><br/>For me, that's where they went wrong, and that's why I say they were so close. If Tim Burton and co. had taken a step back and realized that this film didn't NEED the witch character (Eva Green) to be more than a slight menace in the background it might have saved the picture. That, and removing how overly-sexualized it was. But no, perhaps half the movie was spent doting on the romantic/sexual relationship between Barnabas and the witch, and that isn't even the relationship we're supposed to be rooting for. <br/><br/>From the beginning this film said it was about the importance of family, and that gave me hope. I was excited to see how Barnabas was going to pull this quirky, cursed, and broken family back together AND get the girl, living happily forever after. Indeed, that's what it was at first, and the movie was interesting and fun and you cared about it. Then, like I said, Eva Green showed up, and she threw this movie in a blender. There was almost no time spent on the family, so in the end you didn't even care if all their issues were finally resolved. You didn't care that Barnabas got the girl (well, I did, but I'm a Depp-fanatic and I love when he gets ANY girl). You didn't care who lived or died or came back to life.<br/><br/>This movie spent time highlighting all the wrong things. The parts in it that were good were REALLY good, but sadly those were the parts involving the family, so there were far too few of them. <br/><br/>I desperately want Tim and Johnny to give their partnership a shot again, but this time? No dice. Better luck next time, boys. I'm rooting for ya."

No, I don't know if they used rock 'n roll!), and this whole thing is a love-letter to the decade... the soundtrack is fantastic, and from that period as well), and he must familiarize himself with this new time(Johnny Depp is impeccable at portraying eccentrics, so why this is the first time he was cast as a 200-year-old fish-out-of-water vampire(and this doesn't shy away from the blood-sucking and tragic nature thereof, he is conflicted and we can't view him quite as a role model) is anyone's guess), and when he finds his beloved estate, Collinwood, in disrepair and the family(a big theme in this is the strength of such) connected by little other than blood relation, he vows to improve both to their destined high stature. And there he also meets a woman who looks just like his lost love, and he falls for her. This is based on the show of the same name, I'm told, though I know little about it and can draw no comparisons. There are a few interesting characters, such as Elizabeth(Michelle Pfeiffer), the strong, independent woman who was the head of the Collins' until the return of the patriarch. I like Jackie Earle Haley who plays Willie Loomis, the drunken caretaker... in other roles. Several jokes and gags genuinely fall flat. Is this a black, campy comedy(and Burton brings his sometimes dirty sense of humor, along with his visual flair and signature style)? Yes. But it's also fantasy(there are mysteries and most of the main players have a secret each... and the majority are cool), a dark love story and a soap opera-ish drama. The climax is very nicely done, and this has some truly memorable, inspired sights(such as the sex scene between our two supernatural leads you see in the previews, with them throwing each other into walls, rolling on the ceiling, etc.). There is some bloody violence, disturbing content and mild to moderate language in this. I recommend this to fans of the director and/or the star. 7/10"

","I plan to buy this movie when it's released for DVD/Blu-Ray. It is certainly not a landmark of modern film making but it's entertaining. My better half and I enjoyed it in the theater and look forward to watching it again in the comfort of home. The small group of movie goers in the theater with us all had positive comments as we were leaving.<br/><br/>This iteration of Dark Shadows does not strictly stick to the story lines and characters of the original soap opera. I feel it does pay homage respectfully.<br/><br/>It is basically a comedy but is not a blatant 'leave your brain at home' comedy. Though it contains some overt humor and physical comedy, it also has more subtle humor that may not hit you right away.<br/><br/>It is not a 'jump out of your seat' or 'gross out' horror flick either. It has the pacing and physical appearance of a classic Hammer atmospheric horror movie. <br/><br/>While I don't believe it's destined for making a gazillion dollars in it's theater run, I feel like it has a promising long-term future with a loyal cult of fans. This movie isn't for everyone. You've got to discard any preconception of what you think it will or should be like. Then immerse yourself in the fantasy, suspending disbelief like you would with any film dealing with the supernatural. Finally, listen and watch carefully so you don't miss the subtleties. <br/><br/>Depp was the perfect choice for playing Barnabas. At times, it seemed like he was playing it like a stage role - just a bit over-the-top dramatically. He never breaks character by acknowledging the humor in his misunderstanding contemporary references in the dialog. His reactions range from oblivious to mildly perplexed, lending credibility to the performance.<br/><br/>Gone with the Wind it isn't, but it is a low key entertaining romp."

It's not quite a comedy, and not quite a horror film, and somehow failed to mix those two elements together effectively. In summation it really did not live up to my expectations for the film.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with the script by Seth Grahame-Smith.

"preppy-3","7","2","6","14 May 2012"," Not the disaster it could have been
","Redo of the classic TV soap opera that ran from 1966 to 1971. In the 1700s Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is cursed in becoming a vampire by the evil witch Angelique (Eva Green). He's then chained into a coffin and buried. Almsot 200 years later (in 1972) his coffin is dug up and he is released. He finds the Collins family lives in a crumbling estate and is HEAVILY dysfunctional. He decides to bring the family and mansion back to life...but (somehow) Angelique is still around and will do anything to stop him.<br/><br/>I was expecting the worst from this film. I have fond memories of running home from grammar school to catch this on TV (it played at 3:30) and having it scare me silly. There was even a theatrical 1970 film called ""House of Dark Shadows"" which REALLY poured on the blood and violence...and got by with a PG rating! ""Night of Dark Shadows"" is best left forgotten. It seems director Tim Burton and star Depp are Dark Shadows fans and were going to turn this into a comedy. Well there IS humor in it but there's also violence and a very creepy atmosphere. The film LOOKS great--but all Tim Burton films do. They caught the early 1970s fads and fashions beautifully. Love the music (opens right up with ""Nights in White Satin"") and Danny Elfman cleverly works in music from the original series into his score. They also have a wonderful cast--Depp is just great as Barnabas; Michelle Pfeiffer is given little to do but looks great as Elizabeth Collins; Eva Green is a very sexy (and deadly) Angelique; Christopher Lee and Alice Cooper (!!!) have small parts and Helena Bonham Carter is hysterical as Dr. Julia Hoffman. Also original cast members Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby have an amusing cameo at a party. So it looks great but really drops the ball with plot.<br/><br/>The plot is taken from the series (Angelique loving and cursing Barnabas) but leaves WAY too many things unexplained. Angelique is STILL around after 200 years? How and why? How do the Collins family live with their factory closed down for years? What's with all the jewelry and paintings hidden under the fireplace? Too many questions. Also the last half hour goes barreling out of control. It's non-stop CGI with some truly bizarre plot twists. SPOILER!!! Carolyn is revealed to be a werewolf! Really???? I mean WTF? It comes out of nowhere and is not needed. And, all of the sudden, David's dead mother pops up to take revenge??? Why wait all this time? It's like the writers gave up and threw everything they could dream up on the screen and hoped it would work. END SPOILER. BTW--they leave room for a SEQUEL! Still I was never bored and it DID work. So--it could have been worse. I give it a 7."

","In my opinion Dark Shadows is probably the best recent Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp collaboration, well I think it's certainly a lot better than Alice In Wonderland anyway, but if course there are the haters out there, and I must say that the hate from die hard Dark Shadows the series fans is probably warranted as it steers heavily away from the original subject material but the hate from the general movie going public I simply don't understand.<br/><br/>There is not one other filmmaker out there that can make movies that are stylistically goth and moody the way Mr Burton does. I think his films create the perfect kind of goth / comic combination. The storyline is exciting, led by a hilarious performance by Depp, the movie speeds on a pretty fast pace I thought, there weren't any times that I was bored. The rest of the cast are pretty superb also, Eva Green is terrific playing something totally different as the villain you just love to hate, Angelique Bouchard, and up and coming Aussie actress Bella Heathcote adds a sweet touch also, I did however think that Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter are a little underused but oh well. <br/><br/>Obviously like most movies there are things that are wrong, and Dark Shadows does have it's flaws, the ending is almost not an ending, it kind of seemed like only one part of the story was finalized and the rest was left open ended which was a tad disappointing, but generally the film is great, it's got lots of humor and heart and a nice message about family. I enjoyed it plenty but I guess each to their own.<br/><br/>P.S the soundtrack is excellent, the opening with the moody blues, perfect. :)"

","As a big fan of Burton, what can I say. This movie is by far his worst movie. The storyline is weak and predictable as never seen before. There is zero emphasis to character development. You simply don't care what happens to all of them by the end of the movie. I was almost rooting for Eva Greens character as it probably had the most depth of them all. A father that neglects his children, without any clear motive as to why. A doctor and a werewolves daughter, which have no adde value at all. Even though it has a well known cast, the each seem to fail at their performance, with minor exception for Eva Green and Jackie Earle Haley.

","Billed as a comedy it doesn't even come close to being funny in my opinion. I watched it, hoping it would actually make me laugh. Wrong answer!!! I mean Johnny Depp does his usually nice job as Barnabas but he just doesn't play the role in a funny manner. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the later day matriarch of the Collins clan but she excepts Barnabas's rebirth(?) a little too readily even with the reported family history. I just did not find it humorous at all. Things do pick up when Angelique shows up. She is the witch that originally cursed Barnabas as a vampire. She is still alive after close to 200 years and recognizes Barnabas when he is resurrected when his coffin is found by an excavating team and they open it. All eleven workers are killed to feed the thirst. Depp uses his vampire powers to bring the Collins clan back to prominence. Helen Bonham Carter is a live in shrink at the Collins mansion and discovers the secret when she hypnotizes Barnabas and he spills all. Trying to win the reborn Victoria he looks for new ways to be interesting. I don't know I just stopped after a little over an hour of watching this not funny move. It wasn't even campy."

","It took a while to watch this and I wanted to watch it ever since the trailer came on TV also I've never watched the original series so can't compare them. It looked so funny and classic Burton/Depp partnership . However on watching it it seemed to be crude with a rubbish script and stilted acting. There were random plot twists that had no bearing on the main plot and not much of a back story to go on. There were a few funny one liners but the ones used in the trailer so a film your fooled into thinking is good until you watch it. I also didn't like the ending which basically repeated the beginning so really all you have to do is watch the beginning think of the obvious ending and you have pretty much watched the film.<br/><br/>The idea of it i really liked what would happen if a vampire randomly woke up in modern day how would it act. However this is a tired theme running from queen of the damned and of course the original series (which i will stress again i haven't seen). However, in my opinion with the Gothic mansion that for some reason hadn't been touched in the last 200 years and the almost Victorian looking clothes i sometimes forgot that it was in fact modern day. <br/><br/>I am a Burton fan and a Depp fan, I think they create magic on set with Burton's ideas and Depp's improvisation so I'm disappointed with what they accomplished when they could have gone a lot further with this however for some reason chose not to."

With weak plot, taking so much from the earlier Tim Burton movies, fails to achieve anything noteworthy let alone entertain the audience.<br/><br/>I think we are sick of the ""Burtonesque"" cast choices and visuals and after a while, seeing hundred Johnny Depp characters, Barnabas Collins shows us, Depp is not a good actor, as a matter of fact, Depp is really unable to do anything besides playing himself.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a bad idea, Tim Burton should be ashamed."

It really itched me to see how horrible, horrible these effects were. To see every fling, every motion, delayed and so sickening computer animated, yuck. just yuck.

","First, I should say that I have never seen the original ""Dark Shadows"". I had read about it when I was young, and it didn't really come to my attention until Jonathan Frid died. Maybe that's why I enjoyed Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadows"" more than most people apparently did. It came across as a tongue-in-cheek adaptation. The main focus is Barnabas Collins's goal of reestablishing his family's former glory, but it partly looks at the era when it takes place. There are the fish-out-of-water situations (Barnabas tries to figure out what sort of witchcraft gets used to operate a TV), and one that affirms the generation gap (the stodgy matriarch asks the governess's opinion of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War). But there's also the ""if only"" scene: Barnabas hangs out with some hippies, one of whom predicts that the Vietnam War will be the last war ever. I wish! <br/><br/>Anyway, it's a pretty funny movie, although I did prefer Tim Burton's other movie from last year (his stop-motion adaptation of his earlier ""Frankenweenie""). I'll have to see the original series to see just how this movie compares."
"StevePulaski","6","1","2","23 April 2013"," Don't hate the performers; hate the script
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp used to be the most reliable of partners, with their work dating back to 1990 with the release of the beloved Edward Scissorhand. In present time, the public has grown weary of the two men, as they both seem to be putting on a crazy costume party with every film they make. Regardless, I'll always view Burton and Depp as a likable pair, and even with the lukewarm Dark Shadows, I hold optimism that in the near future I'll hold one of their upcoming films as a great picture.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows, as stated, is not that film. It's a film with an incredible, Gothic look and tone, but a meandering story that tries to dab into way too many genres. Perhaps because I never watched the soap opera, which is now adored by cultists everywhere, I am entitled to have a more favorable opinion than the average fan. However, even a moviegoer ignorant to the original show may have a hard time enjoying this picture to the fullest extent. It's not the easy time I've had sitting still for one-hundred and thirteen minutes.<br/><br/>The plot: Johnny Depp is Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire who has been kept in a coffin for many years by his evil ex-lover Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). When he is unearthed, he ventures back home to the gigantic Collinsport Mansion, which resides in 1972 Maine. After reconnecting with the family, including the shy matriarch, Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the new, very attractive helper Victoria (Bella Heathcore), he must find a way to stop Bouchard, who has now completely taken over the Maine town.<br/><br/>Depp fully exercises his right to be quirky and outright strange and I wouldn't expect anything less. He makes Barnabas into a likable, but rather forgettable soul, and the other members of the Collins family remain pretty faceless for the entire time, appearing as members of the Addams family only far less interesting. As a non-fan of the series like myself, I'm at least wise enough to know that there has to be something more to this series and these characters than what is presented here. If Barnabas remained the entire focus of the show, like here in the film, and the other characters were sidelined to dry supporting roles, how did it go on to merit a level of cult support and fanatical charm amongst the public? The same went for the dreadful film adaptation of The Dukes of Hazzard, which focused almost entirely on stupidity and car chases. Even those unaware of the true ideas behind the episodes know well enough that the show didn't last several seasons and earn love and fame because of simply that; there had to be more that was simply neglected for the film adaptation.<br/><br/>The more prominent problem with Dark Shadows, however, is its lack of self-awareness and thematic certainty. One moment, we see Barnabas fiercely biting the neck of a woman, when the next, we see him making some sort of corny joke that throws the surrounding mood out the window. Is this a comedy? A black one? A costume drama, a quirky thriller? A horror film? An argument can be made for all of those, which is great, but Dark Shadows unevenly cycles through all of those genres that it becomes messy and boring.<br/><br/>Saying a Tim Burton movie has great cinematography and beautiful visuals is like saying Ken Burns' documentaries are full of interesting points and always provide knowledge to viewers. The compliment is a commonplace, and in many ways, I appreciate the look of this film over that of Burton's Alice in Wonderland. The Gothic-style replicated here, heavily emphasizing the black, purple, and white color scheme, is richly detailed and eye-poppingly crafted, and the dark cinematography is terrifically presented through an eerily ominous lens. Even its score accentuates a more haunting, unnerving atmosphere than I originally thought.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a fine picture in the respect that it's made by someone who knows how to decorate a set, utilize special effects effectively, and erect quirkiness on demand. It's just a shame that Burton has such a hard time getting a story across that is interesting and focused. Perhaps it's time for him and Depp to take a break from each other, or seek out a project that will allow them to take a more specific direction, while still breeding their indelible eccentricities into the project. It's a shame to see a few missteps leave two once highly-regarded talents doubted and bashed.<br/><br/>Starring: Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Michelle Pfieffer, Bella Heathcore, and Jackie Earle Haley.

","I am an avid fan of the original serial that ran from 1966-1971. Like Johnny Depp, I was one of those fans that couldn't wait to get out of school in order to watch the next episode. Dark Shadows was a Gothic soap opera that told a very fascinating story, even though it lacked in good props and sometimes good writing. But, it was spellbinding. I did not like the 1990 remake of the series by Dan Curtis - it just didn't work for me. I was pretty much convinced, before the 2012 movie came out, that I would not like this one either. And I didn't at first. I was appalled at the slapstick comedy that ran through the movie. But, this is a movie that grows on you the more you watch it. There is no replacing the original cast, but this movie comes very close. I love the story line of Dark Shadows. And I loved the characters that came out of it. This movie will not please everyone, particularly fans of the original, but I would love to get this on DVD. I think the movie holds up and brought this sixties series into the 21st Century. My hats off to Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby, and Kathryn Leigh Scott for making a brief appearance in this movie. They scared the hell out of me in the sixties - and I thank them. Next time GIVE THEM SOME LINES."

","When I heard Burton and Depp were working together on a black comedy based around vampires I thought ""GREAT"" that will definitely be another DVD to add to collection. As a fan of Burton, Depp also being one of my favourite actors and being a horror fan, vampires and zombies are my cup of tea, also black comedies are right up my street, this really appealed to me. Vampires, comedy, Burton and Depp seemed a perfect combination for me, what could go wrong. <br/><br/>I was very wrong...so glad I did not buy the movie, my brother had the misfortune of buying it instead. <br/><br/>It seemed like it was trying to be a comedy but also trying to be a drama but it wasn't blended well at all, there were funny moments in the film but then the mood would suddenly turn dark and it did not really mix well, one minute would be minor slapstick comedy then next minute innocent victims would be killed which kind of killed the comedic mood that was just set, it's like if you was watching Step-Brothers then Will Ferrel character suddenly died in a car crash, you wouldn't know how to react. The tone of the film really kept clashing. Should have stuck to one genre really.<br/><br/>There were a lot of sub-plots that seemed rushed and kind of shoved in at the last minute, like there was not much substance to them, rather than gradually leading up to like most stories do, they just popped up randomly and did not really seem needed or make sense....SPOILERS! Such as the affair and the werewolf sub-plots just seemed a bit of a mess jumbled in.<br/><br/>Overall the soundtrack and acting were all great, just the plot and way the story was executed in a rather messy way, a really bi-polar film. I still don't know if its a drama or a black comedy? It doesn't really work as either and in my view that's the biggest flaw, personally I think there is something there, Vampire, out of time, living in the 70's is a great concept for a film, Burton is a great director and Depp is a great actor, let alone rest of the cast are all great as well. Just the fact of the tone of the film kept changing, jokes then deaths and not done well, did not really evoke any emotional response from me, other than boredom and disappointment.<br/><br/>Very dull and nothing to grab your attention"

","Number one rule if you're doing a remake, have a reason for doing it. Second rule of doing a remake, if you're going to change the style and tone of the series that you're remaking, then have a reason for doing it as well. Unfortunately for Tim Burton's remake of the 1960's cult classic vampire soap opera, Dark Shadows, he breaks both of these roles.<br/><br/>In another collaboration with Burton, Johnny Depp portrays Barnabas Collins, a 1700's man who wronged an evil witch, and is now cursed to live eternity as a vampire. Where the movie falls apart is when Barnabas is unearthed in 1960's America, where he reunites with his modern day ancestors at their ancestral home in Maine. Seeing as how this happens about ten minutes into the movie, you can see my problem.<br/><br/>Here's why Dark Shadows does not succeed. Unlike the 1960's TV show it's remaking, it's intentionally trying to be funny. The original show was campy, but it was because they did not have the money to pull off what they were trying to do, so it often came across as unintentionally funny. What this movie does, is it turns Barnabas' quest of trying to rebuild the family's shipping empire while having a showdown with the witch that cursed him, into a grand farce. It's a movie that's cracking jokes around every turn, not interested in delivering a fun supernatural adventure, but in trying to be something that the original never was. Now, would I be so negative if the movie actually was funny? Probably not, but the thing is, the movie isn't funny.<br/><br/>Featuring countless jokes about 1960's counter culture, such as hippies, the jokes just aren't funny. Rather than being clever, the movie reverts to innuendos and humor we've seen countless times before. I seriously would have enjoyed this story so much more if it was just played straight, and let humor be evoked through the absurdity of seeing supernatural beings battle one another, rather than intentionally trying to create that wink-wink, nudge-nudge form of comedy. Honestly, the only ray of shining light is the hauntingly beautiful, and colorful lensing of the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel.<br/><br/>I give Dark Shadows a 4 out of 10!"

","If you are going into this movie thinking you are going to see the drama filled Dark Shadows TV show brought to life by the infamous Tim Burton, think again. If you are going into this movie thinking you are going to be watching another great Burton/Depp/Carter movie, then you are right, as a stand alone movie this is a great movie about the life of a vampire who has been entombed for centuries, only to have to help save his decedents from evil spirits after being resurrected; however, this movie has very little shared plot line with the actual TV program. With the TV show being somewhat of a drama, Burton went for more of a comedic feel to life as a turn of the century vampire. It all depends on which end of the spectrum you're looking from. Me being the Burton/Depp/Carter fan that I am, thoroughly enjoyed watching Depp submerge himself in the quirky, somewhat naive Barnubus Jones. If you are watching the movie expecting it to be a movie version of the TV show, then you'll surely be disappointed. Overall, another win for Burton as far as I'm concerned!"

","I've always heard of the original 1966 TV series Dark Shadows, but I never saw it, so I have no idea how it compares with this film. At the very least, I always thought it was weird that they'd make a movie out of this after more than forty years of the TV show's premier.<br/><br/>On its own merits, the film has its moments. Tim Burton's typical Gothic aesthetic is applied pretty generously, so the film does have its fair share of darkly fantastic imagery, wicked monsters, and imaginative special effects. There are also occasional moments of amusing comedy. In fact, it comes pretty close to achieving the same effect as the film adaptations of The Addams Family or The Brady Bunch, since all these films took the characters of the original shows and plopped them into modern times to create some really funny scenes. The Dark Shadows film sets out to do the same, and it is successful at times. The problem is, it's never constant, so the film tends to drag in between the funny scenes and the more eventful scenes.<br/><br/>The story for this is not too bad. I've heard that the film crams in entire seasons of the show into its short runtime; fortunately, the film is never rushed, but it feels as though a number of scenes, subplots, and characters are presented without any direct bearing on the main story. Regardless, the film does a fine job of keeping all the plots and characters straight and presentable for the audience. Characters are pretty interesting all around, even if some of them are one-sided or undercooked. A running theme of family helps tie it all together.<br/><br/>The film looks good and slick, with good photography and editing. Acting is not bad; I enjoyed Johnny Depp's eccentricities, and I loved Eva Green's performance. Writing is alright. A good amount of quality sets, props, costumes, and special effects were dispensed effectively. Music is pretty groovy.<br/><br/>I recommend it as a rental.<br/><br/>3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)"

","...because after watching the trailer i thought this film was going to be dire. positives would be the fantastic make up, sets, lighting and an engaging performance from johnny depp. plus i think michelle pfeiffer is very beautiful so it was a pleasure to just look at her. but pfeiffer is part of the problem. her character, like virtually all of the others, is woefully underused. this is particularly problematic with the character of victoria who is meant to be the love of barnabas' life. but he does not spend any time with her and instead has sex with two other women. as a result, victoria and barnabas' relationship is not convincing at all.<br/><br/>the flow of the film is often disrupted by scenes that are jarring and don't belong together. the mingling of the Gothic and modern seldom works here.<br/><br/>some plot developments seemed tacked on and pointless as well, such as carolyn being a werewolf.<br/><br/>worse of all though was the ending. dear me. the entire town witnesses that barnabas and angelique are supernatural creatures. the sheriff, also confronted with this horror simply says ""nothing to see here"" and everyone just walks away? that isn't wry, or clever. that is just lazy and unconvincing, as is the set up for a sequel.<br/><br/>a shame really. fine actors, great potential, but poorly executed."
"julian-mumford","4","1","2","13 October 2012"," A disappointing entry into the Burton filmography
","Based on an obscure black and white TV serial that few have ever heard of, Tim Burton's latest has it's work cut out finding an audience.<br/><br/>However, teamed with his regular acting team of Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, adding Michelle Pffeifer and Eva Green for good measure, we should be in for another Gothic treat.<br/><br/>In 1776 Barnabas Collins (Depp) is an aristocratic young son of the immigrant Liverpudlian self made wealthy family who owns and manages a large fishing and cannery business. The family lends it's name to Collinwood, the town they created on the eastern seaboard of America, the town and business continue to prosper and all is well.<br/><br/>Barnabas, spurning the advances of his maid Angelica Bouchard (Eva Green), courts his one true love Josette duPres (Heathcote). Angelica does not take this well and being a secret Witch, has more tools at her disposal than most. Sending Josette to her hypnotized death off ""Widows Peak"", closely followed by a heartbroken and distraught Barnabas.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Barnabas, death is insufficient suffering to visit upon him and transformed into a Vampire, he must stay buried for two hundred years to endure his pain. These are not spoilers as most of these events occur in a lengthy prologue.<br/><br/>Mistakenly and tragically unearthed, Barnabas returns to regain his lost life and is pitched into the massively dysfunctional Collinwood manor house, where time has not been kind to the firm and his rather hopeless descendants.<br/><br/>Cue lots of 1070's jokes with Barnabas speaking as a 1800's gentleman, set against the ""Peace out"" man Hippy trip of the times. ""How soon can the horses be ready?"" he asks, only to be told they have a Chevy or marvelling at the TV, ""Reveal yourself tiny songstress"".<br/><br/>Back at the manor we have matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Pfeiffer) attempting to pull the family together and through tough times. Roger Collins (Johnny Miller), drinker lover and general layabout, together with his ""delightful"" children, sullen Caroly teenager (Chloe Grace Moretz) and morose and distinctly disturbed David (McGrath). Helping David through his childhood traumas following his mothers ""death at sea"", is Dr Hoffman (Bonham-Carter) who spends more time holding a bottle than sitting by the counseling couch.<br/><br/>Just prior to the arrival of a be-fanged Barnabas, is a new waif like governess by the name of Victoria (Heathcote), who appears remarkably similar to the lost love of Barnabas. This does not go unnoticed by the rival business entrepreneur, the very old but unchanged Bouchard, whose business succeeds as the Collin's diminishes.<br/><br/>We are all set for either a rousing comedy or dramatic piece with Burton's usual directorial flourishes and Danny Elfman score. Unfortunately, the film never real takes off, presenting a mish-mash of tone and set pieces that do not come together as an enjoyable whole.<br/><br/>The acting is good, no-one really disappoints and the CGI effects are first rate but the film lacks any real structure to pull all the elements together. There are times where the action is rather boring and emotionally, it is difficult to care for any of the characters, neither statements normally associated with Burton.<br/><br/>The film builds to a frenetic denouement where Burton, perhaps in a last ditch effort to save the film, throws everything at the screen, including bizarrely Alice Cooper. With similarities to ""Death Becomes her"" and ""Addams Family"", the film descends into almost horror lite, seemingly largely disconnected to what has come before.<br/><br/>The project appears very self indulgent, pushing ahead with subject matter and story that Burton wanted to see on screen, without perhaps knowing or even caring whether an audience existed. Alternatively, Burton has moulded the original quirky story into something hopefully more commercial, robbing the source material of it's charm. Either way, vanity projects are dangerous investments when they cost $150 million to make, audiences responded with a mediocre $238 Million worldwide.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A Gothic comedy/dramatic film with a great cast and effects, let down by an obscure story that largely fails to engage the audience.<br/><br/>A disappointing entry into the Burton filmography, could and hopefully will do better next time."

","Dark Shadows – TRASH IT (C) A good movie adaptations or remake is the one, which is for everyone whether they know or not from where it was adopted. Dark Shadows is not only a corny adaptation of the famous US soup opera but it is also doesn't stand alone as a movie on its feet regardless of its original source of material. I think everyone knows about this Vampire Soap Opera or if you don't you can watch its trailers. Let's talk about the movie, It won't be wrong to say that this the worst collaborative effort between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, even though I was not a huge fan of the Chocolate factory but still that was entertaining and had heart to it. This time Tim Burton's heavy soap opera direction looked flawed and pretentious. Johnny Depp's performance is always a treat to watch in Tim Burton's movie but this time he was just pale Gothic looking caricature delivering lines. The only good thing about Dark Shadows is Eva Green and her witchy smile. This woman looks marvelous and her evil antics with supreme confidant steal the show. Chloe Grace Moretz is undoubtedly the most promising young star but this time she had few funny lines but twist in the end just makes her look completely silly. Bella Heathcote is gorgeous but she doesn't get much scope in it. Helena Bonham Carter and Michelle Pfiffer alright as always but there is nothing interesting in their characters. In the end, it's a disappointing big budget summer movie with stealer cast and horrible characterization."

"westerlund-147-949472","6","1","2","26 July 2012"," Funny and such, but...
","So here comes another dish made with the Burton-Depp recipe, and this time it is a new adaptation of a TV-series with the same name from 1966. I have not seen the original series, so I have no idea of how true this movie is to its source, and therefore I saw it only for the movie it was. It's a Gothic vampire-story that revolves around Barnabas Collins, a rich, young man who's the son of a wealthy merchant and lives in Collingwood Manor in the year of 1752. He has an affair with a servant girl (played by Eva Green) but it is all physical for him and he soon leaves her for a girl he truly loves. Bad move, since the servant girl is also a witch. She proceeds to kill his parents, kill his love, and then she curses him to an eternal life as a vampire and then locks him in a coffin! Damn! After 300 years he finally gets out and decides to return to Collinwood manor and resume his life together with the left-overs of the Barnabas family. He quickly discovers however, that in 1972 things are very, very different, and he struggles to fit in in modern society. And as that was not enough, the servant girl has also hung around due to her magic, and under different aliases she has become the local community's biggest fish and has on her own driven the Collins family to the edge of bankruptcy. Barnabas really chose the right girl to fool around with, didn't he? I should begin to say that I did enjoy the film, however I still feel that it raises a cloud of doubt whether Tim Burton's film-making abilities are still up to par. After the, in my opinion, minor disaster of Alice in Wonderland Burton needed to follow up with at strong piece to convince us that he still has what it takes to deliver the special kind of magic he is known for. I do not feel that Dark Shadows accomplishes that. It feels in many ways confused, unfocused and sometimes downright sloppy.<br/><br/>However, let's start with the good stuff. This movie is funny, like really funny. Most jokes centers around the cultural clashes between Barnabas 18th century's manner and the wilderness of the 1970:s. We get the scenes were he interacts with modern technology, starts to appreciate modern music and tries to comprehend the strange ideals people have. This kind of humor could easily have become cheap and tiresome, but somehow this movie makes it work all the way. The acting is overall great. Johnny Depp is as solid as always, and Eva Green is great as the villain (she has a thing for playing evil sorceresses). One of my favorite performances though has to be Michelle Pfeiffers portrayal as the current matriarch of the Collins family. She desperately tries to keep the Collins family together and going, and she has harsh and effective way that makes her easy to like. It's also fun too see some quick cameos from Christopher Lee and Tom Savini (very short, keep your eyes open). The 70's music is also great and fits very well to the visual. Hell, they even manage to integrate a creepy Alice Cooper-ballad to a romantic scene.<br/><br/>One of the major downsides with this movie is how it seems to be confused on what kind of film it wants to be. It goes from being a half-serious comedy to a whacked out mindflip and back. It changes between lighthearted to really dark in a way that just doesn't mesh to me. Also, the script can be really sloppy at times, and the focus is not always were it should be at times. This is best shown in the romance between Barnabas and Victoria Winters (played by Bella Heathcote). It is supposed to be very central to the story, but it is showed to the sidelines and is not expanded very much. Instead we get a lot of thrown in stuff that steals focus from the film. There is a lot of scenes that does nothing for the story and just comes off as pointless, and you can't but wonder why they did not replace these scenes with... you know, point.<br/><br/>All in all a mixed bag. Compared to movies like Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and even later stuff like Sweeney Todd it doesn't pack a similar punch. But dammit Burton, I know you CAN make movies. Maybe you need do refresh yourself, give someone else than Depp a go, bring more focus to your stories. I'm still a fan an excitingly awaits your next work."
"KineticSeoul","5","1","2","1 July 2012"," Predictable and dull but still watchable
","Johnny Depp playing a vampire in that takes place in the 70's seems like a cool idea. And I gotta admit when I saw the trailer to this movie I wasn't super excited or anything like that but thought it just might have potential. But this isn't anything special and is a flick that is easily forgettable. It starts out alright with the intro and all but soon gets dull afterwards. Now Depp is pretty good with his role as a vampire that got locked up for almost 200 yrs to wake up in the 70's. In fact it's a role that he suggested to Tim Burton, well him wanting to play a vampire at least. Even if you didn't know this is a Tim Burton movie, you can pretty much tell right off the bat. Although a lot of his movie are like this, but this story direction that has Tim Burton all over it gets tiresome. The style of it is alright, but there is almost no development when it comes to a lot of the characters. Now I am not really a big Tim Burton fan or anything like that but it seems he just focused putting way too much of his style into this movie. With Gothic elements and stuff that the focus didn't seem to have gone much when it came to the script. The quirky humor sometimes works but it just seemed forced sometimes. Cause most of the humor in this movie comes from Barnabas Collins(Johnny Depp) not necessarily being able to live through almost 200 yrs from being locked up and times have really changed for him. Thus most of the humor comes from his fascination and how he perceives certain things that are in the 70's. Even the set pieces and background didn't entirely seem all that 70's as well besides hippies, lava lamp, a certain singer and such. The idea seems decent for this flick but when it comes down to it all, there really isn't anything original about this and just about everything is pretty much predictable. It's watchable but still a forgetful film. Also some critics seem to bash on Eva Green's performance saying it's too over the top. But it worked for this movie since it made the scenes she is in less dull.<br/><br/>5.6/10"
"genefog","7","1","2","24 June 2012"," I liked it but did not love it.
","I grew up watching the original show and it was dark, spooky and mysterious, very Gothic and it sucked you in, so to speak. The movie did great with the logical idea of a victorian vampire waking up in the present, and the seventies was not bad, but the amount of killing done at a time was a bit underthought. The means of dealing with Amngelique was very lame, and the sex scene was something that never should have happened, along with the ""client confidentiality"" scene that did not belong in this movie at all.<br/><br/>I loved the house, but essentially the movie did disappoint in many ways. Barnabas appeared debonair, but foolish (organ scene) and if I had to guess, I'd say no one took the time to really study the original to get the atmosphere into it. Additionally Barnabas's issues over lacking a casket were very corny.<br/><br/>They could have used the original atmosphere and left out the silliness and had a better movie, and Barnabas could have been much more dark. At least they did not deviate from the original plot as the Friday the 13th movies did, one movie barely related to another. If there is a sequel, I hope it gets better."
"valadas","7","1","2","19 June 2012"," Vampires and witches can also have sentiments
","This is a good fantastic movie directed by the firm hand of Tim Burton who is a specialist in this kind of movies. It benefits also of a luxury cast with great performers such as Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter. It's a story of a love-hate relationship between a witch (the beautiful Eva Green) and a man she transforms into a vampire (Johnny Depp) and has him buried for two centuries to punish him for rejecting her love after having induced by witchcraft the woman he loved to kill herself. When he is disinterred by chance he regains his place in his family's estate and the war begins again between them also because meanwhile his family had lost their local power to the witch although they ignore she is one. This struggle assumes physical aspects sometimes extremely violent and very well filmed and acted. But the final scenes are particularly moving. This good movie could be very good indeed were not for some loose ends in certain scenes not well explained by images or words. And of course in this kind of vampire movies we always must accept and take for granted the several gratuitous murders the vampire performs to feed on his victims' blood. And it proves also how vampires and witches can also have sentiments. One of the best movies of this kind after all and this kind doesn't allow much better by its own nature."
"TheSquiss","5","1","2","17 June 2012"," At least it looks good...
","I love the way Tim Burton's films look. He is undeniably a master of concept and dark designs. Just look at the sets and costumes of Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sleepy Hollow The list is almost as long as his list of films as a director. His set builders construct vast, intricate worlds that dominate studio lots, his costumers dress the actors in exquisite creations and the geniuses holding the makeup palettes sculpt hideous beauty that draws the viewers eyes.<br/><br/>However, beautiful sets and exquisite make-up do not compensate for poor direction and shoddy films and yet again I find myself starting a review with a defence of Burton with ""Well, it looks good "" I really wanted to embrace Dark Shadows and emerge from Cineworld proclaiming ""Burton is back!"" I really want to say that after a chronic dip in form since 1994's largely unappreciated but almost flawless Ed Wood, Burton has returned to the screen to fulfill the promise he showed with the heart-warming Edward Scissorhands and the anarchic comedy of Beetlejuice two years earlier. I want to but, as you'll have worked out by now, I can't.<br/><br/>Yes, in 2003 he brought us Big Fish. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it a couple of times in the past year alone, but it isn't a 'great' and it doesn't hit the heights of his best work. And it certainly isn't compensation enough for Planet of the Apes or Alice in Wonderland! So what of Dark Shadows? It should work; it has great pedigree, the source is a quirky (cult, if you will) soap opera of days gone by, the cast is a cocktail of Burton stalwarts (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter), new-to-the-fold stars (Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Lee Miller, Eva Green, Chloë Grace Moretz) and barely known stars-in-the-making (Gulliver McGrath & Christopher Lee ☺) and even the plot is an engaging spin on a familiar idea.<br/><br/>In the late 1700s, wealthy landowner Barnabas Collins (Depp) makes the grave error of resisting the advances of his maid Angelique (a delicious performance from Eva Green) who just happens to be a witch. She transforms him into a vampire and buries him alive. Two hundred years later workmen unearth his coffin and release him, whereupon Barnabas drinks their blood and returns home to find his penniless descendants camped out, suffering, embittered and unaware that the cause of their misfortune, Angelique, is also two hundred years old and that they've been sitting on a fortune locked in hidden vaults all these years.<br/><br/>What follows is a fish-out-of-water tale of resurgence, revenge, unrequited love, death, blood and a tired, embarrassing, pointless, gimmicky appearance from Alice Cooper. It has all the ingredients to make an amazing black forest gateau but somewhere along the line someone has attempted to make a sausage with it and ended up with a mess that won't even enhance the compost heap.<br/><br/>Cooper aside, there isn't really a duff performance. Depp is as controlled and delightfully off-kilter as ever, Pfeiffer engages as the matriarch, Bonham Carter reigns in her OTT tendencies to give a sad, sexual performance and Johnny Lee Miller's Roger is just enough of a nob to regard with enjoyable disdain.<br/><br/>The inescapable problems are the direction and the hastily cobbled third act that ran out of ideas. The right amount of effort has gone into casting and visuals, but too little has been spent on writing and crafting a film that deserves our attention. The final act could have been written by a committee of performing monkeys with a decent collection of DVDs as a reference point. It flops about weakly in a resolution of sorts that fails to get under the skin, excite, shock or even entertain adequately. The script plods, much of the dialogue is leaden and the overall impression is of a high performance car being driven uphill, backwards and in third gear.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, Tim Burton created; he crafted out of virgin clay and exhibited delights that surprised, thrilled and remain strong in our memories and hearts twenty-five years later. Here, he's borrowed, referenced, rehashed and recycled. Dark Shadows is a weak hybrid of The Exorcist and Mars Attacks! with a splicing of Nosferatu. Is Angelique anything more than the witchy sister of Lisa Marie's alien girl from Mars Attacks!? Even the sex scene, which should be hugely entertaining, and maybe a little titillating, is a diluted imitation of Jeff Goldblum's & Emma Thompsons in The Tall Guy.<br/><br/>It's a pity. It's a waste of a fine talent and a great idea. But at least it looks good.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss.

","After seeing Tim Burton's Ed Wood (which I consider his masterpiece) i became a huge fan of his. Hes really unique with has his own touch of Gothic and dark imagery. I was really hyped for Dark Shadows but when saw it and i was disappointed. What kills it: I loved the movie, the humor is cool but what kills it is the lack of focus. The movie didn't focus on all the characters except for Barnabus of course but i didn't care for any of the other characters. for example Victoria is one of the main characters in the story and we see her only for 15 mins! i almost forgot she was in the damn movie. Another thing is the acting, they were all great except for that little boy, he was boring!. What made it good: One of the coolest references was a poster for Christopher Lee's Hammer Dracula A.D 1972,which then followed by a conservation between Barnabus and the Count himself Christopher Lee (C.Lee who played Dracula in every Hammer Dracula). Alice Cooper appearance was the best for me he made the movie for me the best part!. Over all i give it 6/10 average."
"TOMNEL","6","1","2","11 June 2012"," A great looking, and often funny movie, in search of a plot and a point.
","A Gothic romance about a vampire...this sounds like primo Tim Burton material here. On a visual level, this world here is fully realized, but unfortunately, that's the only place it's realized. The plot is kind of a set piece to set piece episodic one, and the romance here is severely underplayed, making the ending kind of pointless. But what the trailer emphasized was the comedy, and a good chunk of this film features some well played fish out of water comedy. On some levels this film is a surprising success, and on others an complete failure. It's entertaining, but that's about it really. <br/><br/>It's the late 1700s, and Barnabas Collins' (Johnny Depp) family started a small fishing town called Collinsport, and together they live in Collinwood, a luxurious mansion. Barnabas breaks the heart of a spiteful witch Angelique (Eva Green), and she kills his parents, forces his lover Josette (Bella Heathcote) to commit suicide, turns Barnabas into a vampire, and imprisons him in a coffin underground. Two centuries later, a mysterious woman ""Victoria Winters"" is going to become the governess for David, a surviving member of the Collins family who is deeply disturbed. Barnabas is then freed from his coffin, and returns to find his living relatives in need of help, so he tries to bring life back into his town of Collinsport. Meanwhile, Angelique (who still appears to be the same age) has taken control of the fishing industry in Collinsport, and he must help his family bring their dying fishing industry back.<br/><br/>For those of you who didn't like the visual style of Tim Burton's last picture, ""Alice in Wonderland"", this one should be a refreshing return to form (visually that is). The sets are really neat, and Collinsport is quite a beautiful little fantasy town. The special effects are also really good when they are featured. On a visual level, this might be Burton's best looking film since ""Sleepy Hollow"" over a decade ago, and the score by Danny Elfman is also quite good. And what do people think of when they think of Tim Burton movies? Awesome visual style (check), bouncy score usually by Danny Elfman (check) and Johnny Depp (check). But what this movie is lacking is a plot. Something to drive the story other than jokes and neat sets is needed. <br/><br/>The layout of the story and overall tone is quite odd. The film starts off as a Gothic romantic fantasy telling the history of Barnabas Collins. By no means is this portion of the film meant to be humorous. Then we begin to follow a mysterious girl ""Victoria Winters"" (who becomes lovers with Depp), who has taken on the job of being little David's governess. This portion of the film isn't particularly funny either, but it adds an element of mystery so the movie becomes a bit more interesting. After about 15 minutes of this girl as our main character, the film becomes an unfocused fish out of water comedy for the remainder of the film (sans the last 25 or so minutes). This part of the film is actually quite funny. Then the climax and last portion of the film becomes like a horror action film of sorts.<br/><br/>There is a romance subplot, but it has no importance in the story until the very end. There is no chemistry between Depp and Heathcote, because they are only given like 4 scenes together, and none of them feel very organic. Also sadly underwritten are Victoria Winters, and David's relationship. Ar the beginning of the film seem like they could have an interesting dynamic, but instead they are given very little screen time. Every sub-plot is dropped in favor of Depp's fish-out-of-water routine, which is quite funny, but also makes this movie's plot slight and overall point even slighter.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is a real treat bringing back memories of older Burton films like Beetlejuice. The performances are also very good, especially Johnny Depp who does some great deadpan comedy here, but what's missing is a point. While it may entertain, in the end, nothing really matters here.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 124 mins. PG-13 for sexual humor throughout, some language and violence."

","First things first: I have not seen any episodes of the original TV series this is based on. So no comparisons to that from me. This might have been a good thing from what I hear. But let's get back to this movie, that would've faired worse if Captain Jack ... I mean Johnny Depp wasn't in it. My niece who watched it with me, said she could spot Capt. Jack mannerisms. I hope that does not spoil the movie experience for you, but I guess this is the curse or the bad side of having created a great character.<br/><br/>Still that is not the weak point of the movie. Not even the weirdness, which I thought was nice mostly. But the movie itself is just not funny enough. It is pretty silly, but unfortunately not in a good sense. There is a scene where my niece went ""That letter looks like ..."" and while she was kidding I assume, I was still thinking ""Kids"" these days. But apparently Tim Burton thought the same thing ... He played right into that and it just doesn't work. Best scenes are in the trailer, the rest can be forgotten (including one very dark moment at a camp fire). Not as bad as his Planet of the Apes re-imagining, but still far away from his best efforts"
"charles-simpson","5","1","2","8 June 2012"," Cringe
","The trailer portrays the film to be a light hearted humorous family flick however I wouldn't be quick to class it as a comedy. The majority of the ""funny"" aspects of the film are Barnabas' reactions to 20th century objects. His fascination and bemusement with the MacDonald's logo, lava lamps and tarmac was funny the first time but the next dozen or so not so much. <br/><br/>The biggest downfall of the whole plot was the many sub plots and confusing details. We learn things as the film unravels which seem completely unnecessary and there are so many story lines going along at once it muddles up what the film is truly trying to achieve. I found myself rather bored throughout the film and although I normally complain films are too predictable, this one could have gone in so many directions there was no way of guessing what was coming around the corner. <br/><br/>The mother of the 20th century Collins family was the only character I truly liked. Michelle Pfeiffer played her brilliantly whereas the rest of the cast seemed slightly misdirected. Helena Bonham Carter just seemed completely out of place not only with red hair but just generally during the whole film. If you've seen Pirates of the Caribbean, imagine Captain Jack dressed as a vampire and that's what you get from Depp. Regarding the other characters...I only watched it yesterday and I have forgotten them completely. They were as memorable as their names on the credits. <br/><br/>There were a few positives; the set and costumes were brilliant and there were some decent special effects. There was one of the most interesting sex scenes I've seen in a long time, if you thought Twilight had a rough one wait until you see this. I'm surprised the two characters didn't come out with serious injuries. Then again, being immortal has its benefits. In all honesty my favourite part of the movie was the montages of everything getting sorted out set to some uplifting music. But who doesn't love a montage?<br/><br/>The verdict though: I wouldn't recommend this film. I believe it was built up to be a lot with a good cast and Tim Burton as the director but for me, it was a disappointment. From what I've heard you would be better off watching the original Dark Shadows and give this one a miss. I could write another few paragraphs about the flaws in the plot but once we start unpicking every detail of films not much remains.<br/><br/>Charlie Simpson"

","Schizophrenic underachiever that markets itself as a unique and appealing comedy on the level of perhaps ""Being There"" as long-deceased and cursed vampire Johnny Depp awakens in 1972 Maine with typically well-calculated and hilarious results. However, Tim Burton's unfocused, mean-spirited, and oft-times confusing direction derails what should have been the film's premise with surprisingly dark and disturbing sequences, a distracting love triangle between Depp, his true love Bella Heatchcote (in a yawner of a role), and the super-sexy Eva Green (arguably hitting a new note for even her on the heat meter) who doubles as a witch and a cutthroat businesswoman of canned foods (no kidding), and waning attempts of possible character redemptions. Also along for the ride is the always under-rated Helena Bonham Carter as a frazzled psychiatrist, 1972 family matriarch Michelle Pfeiffer (woefully lost and miscast here), and cameos by horror veterans like Jackie Earle Haley, Christoper Lee, and even Alice Cooper. Definitely would have worked better as a long skit ala something from ""Saturday Night Live"" or even perhaps a sitcom, uneven elements turn a possible winner into another in the long line of ho-hum releases from the sometimes brilliant, but sometimes negatively outlandish Burton. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","'How can we ever not enjoy a movie coming from Johnny Depp and Tim Burton?' would be the thought when we head to see Dark Shadows. But it's time we change that thought.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is the 2012 flavour by Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Posing their earlier masterpieces like Sweeny Tood, Sleepy Hollow and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in mind, Dark Shadows is a letdown. Though the movie is given a Sweeny Todd and Sleepy Hollow feel, it doesn't match the perfection.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is the adaption of the 60's/70's television series of the same name. But not to worry; you are not required to see the 1200 episodes to understand the movie.<br/><br/>The story is leapt from the 17th century to the 20th century with a flawless narration by Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) himself about his cursed life. He speaks about his love for Rosette (Bella Heathcote) and his physical relation with the maid-witch Angelique (Eva Green). He also explains about the vengeance she craves after changing him to an immortal blood sucking vampire and about burying him alive. All are told in the most precise and the most convincing manner. <br/><br/>The flow is smooth even after the 200 years when Barnabis is returned after spending his eternity inside the iron coffin. Thanks to the distinguished screenplay. But probably they could have offered a more fascinating script to keep the movie lovers intact.<br/><br/>The impeccable sets of Collinwood and the costumes give us no room to find a fault in the execution of the movie. However, the fun element fades as the movie proceeds and gradually looses the audience attention. Never the less, the open ended closing of the movie hints us a part 2 might be in progress very soon.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's perfect execution of Barnabas and Eva green as the seductive Angelique are without doubt, gripping. But they are not just enough as the ingredients of a perfect enjoyment piece. Helena Bonham Carter, is not really exploited. The movie takes you through a boring ride frequently. <br/><br/>The one who needs another special mention is Danny Elfman. He has done it again with his magical score. <br/><br/>Dark Shadows, with an ensemble cast like Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green and Michelle Pfiefer, is not really another path breaking movie from Tim. However, making a 1200 episodic series into a 100 min movie is not a joke.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp lovers are sure to have a merry time admiring him. So if you are his fan, do catch this movie this weekend !!!"

","Who else could be the better choice to direct thiz movie other than Tim Burton. The description is Gothic, epic, classic, mystic, magic, comic, slapstick, frantic, scenic, antique, not yet tragic, but with no garlic! Just like his previous masterpieces such as ""Beetle Juice"" (1988), ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Big Fish"" (2003) and ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010). Thiz time, Tim Burton tries to bring back classic vampire tale based on the original TV series in 1970s-era. The story takes place in the year 1972, when 196-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins has just awakened in his coffin after being cursed by a cold hearted witch Angelique Bouchard who previously fell for him. Now, he arrives back in his grandiose mansion to restore his family to its former glory, what he doesn't know later, the world has changed a lot since his last departure. The original version looked more like a soap opera, but in Tim Burton's hand it turns out to be a fresh family drama with some mysterious elements and sometimes cynical good humor. It's certainly acceptable, considering Tim Burton has done his homework for compiling 1.225 TV episodes into two-hour movie. On thiz occasion, the Director Tim Burton has also successfully gathered together all his favorite performers. Thiz is his eighth collaboration with Johnny Depp, his seventh with his real-life partner Helena Bonham Carter, his fifth with Christopher Lee and his second with Michelle Pfeiffer after her role as Catwoman in ""Batman Returns"" (1992). Have you ever seen the original Barnabas Collins which played by Jonathan Frid? If you are old enough to have a chance to see his performance previously, you probably would have realized that Johnny Depp has done a lot of efforts to portray that character through his tone of voice, his facial expression and even his gestures. Beside that, there are some other performances which have got my attention. For the umpteenth time, Chloë Grace Moretz has shown her maturity in acting, thiz time to become a rebel teen daughter. Bella Heathcote also makes a special impression as a mysterious new nanny. And Eva Green is obviously very attractive and sensual even as a ruthless witch. The rest of the Cast members are Johnny Lee Miller, Jackie Earle Haley and Gulliver McGrath, plus a special guest appearance by the legendary rock star Alice Cooper. In fact, the gang of 1970s version also make cameo appearances as the guests in the ballroom party scene, including the late Jonatahan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott. Thiz movie really brings us back in time to 1970s. Everything is so authentic, including the clothes, the hairstyles, the cars and even the songs. My favorite moment is when they play the song ""Top of the World"" by The Carpenters. Somehow, the song sounds so fresh and uplifting. It sounds pretty much like thiz, ""Such a feeling's coming over me. There is wonder in most everything I see"". It can also be precise words to describe thiz movie.

","Dark Shadows is unlike the many strange and different Tim Burton films that have come across in past years from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland. This film had a great story with very good acting from Johnny Depp, Chloe Grace Mortez, Michelle Pfiffer, and Jackie Earl Haley. Haley and Depp were hilarious, while Pfiffer and Eva Green provided the film a backbone. Even though this film may seem strange from the posters and trailers, it truly isn't when seeing the movie due to the story explaining the odd elements of the film. In fact, the only strange part of the film was the always strange Helena Bonham Carter, who actually was decent in this film. This film has some decent scares and some good laughs along the way which makes this a more mature version of A Nightmare Before Christmas and a funnier and very more kid friendly version of Sweeney Todd. This is an easy 7.5 out of 10 and should be watched regardless of how strange it may appear."

"DICK STEEL","6","1","2","27 May 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Dark Shadows
","Director Tim Burton, actor Johnny Depp and composer Danny Elfman reunite for their umpteenth collaboration on film, and like all their previous works together, there's always a touch of the strange, the quirky and a whole lot of dark themes all rolled into one. Based upon the 1960s television soap opera series, it's not exactly The Addams Family here, but one will see some shades of similarities in this big screen adaptation, with a more serious romantic love triangle here taking centerstage.<br/><br/>It's the story of how Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp), the scion of the Collins family who had crossed from Liverpool to the New World in the 18th Century, and through their fishing business amassed fame, fortune and being responsible to create a new city revolving around it. But Barnabas' romantic indiscretion with their supposed maid Angelique (Eva Green), a witch in hiding in his household, ran his promising future to the ground, cursed to live out the rest of his life as a vampire, see his one true love Josette (Bella Heathcote) commit suicide in front of his eyes, and having to witness the demise of his parents as well. And to make matters worse, Angelique turned the townfolks against him, locking him up in a box and buried six feet under.<br/><br/>Fast forward some 200 years later, and the Collins family's fortunes had seen better days, with the family now made up of matriarch and distant relative of Barnabas, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), womanizing Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller) and his son David (Gulliver McGrath), David's psychiatrist Dr Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) who craves youth and drink, and housekeeper Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley). And we join Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote again) as the new governess to the children, who shares an uncanny resemblance with Josette, which means Barnabas, broken out of his confines by construction workers, get to pursue true love all over again. But not before Angelique gets wind of her infatuation's break out, and returns to cause trouble for Barnabas and the Collins all over again, until she gets what she wants.<br/><br/>There's some good natured humour ranging from the usual slapstick, to that of a fish being caught out of water since Barnabas speaks in a style already extinct, and has plenty to catch up with in the modern 70s world of free love and technology. There's no glitter in this vampire, and it's old school throughout with his fear of sunlight, which means his wheelings and dealings to get the Collins back on track in the fishing business have to be conducted in shadow, as well as to curtail his need for human blood to keep alive. But that's about all that's great about the film, which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>Could it be that Tim Burton is running out of steam with the rehashing of the usual dark themes in his films, that enough is enough? It's not to say Dark Shadows is a bad film, but this collaboration with the usual suspects looked a bit tired. Elfman's score is uninspiring and somewhat subdued behind the soundtrack (featuring Alice Cooper too, no less), and the direction very much looking alike with a host of other Burton films. Too many characters in this film, some with last minute surprises, resulted in a lack of focus on many supporting cast, where even Michelle Pfeiffer got little else to do here except to agree on a pact with Barnabas, and having mother-daughter issues. Jackie Earle Haley was also wasted, as was Jonny Lee Miller and Helena Bonham Carter, all having little to contribute to the plot.<br/><br/>So we're left with Johnny Depp and Eva Green to carry the film, and their scenes together were wickedly interesting, but also repetitive in their rivalry. Bella Heathcote plays the go-between character, but while the point of view shifted to her when we enter the shift in timeline, that very much shifted out of focus once Barnabas entered the picture, and their supposed true romance wasn't a tad believable. Which is a pity since that would have formed an emotional crux to anchor the film upon, rather than to be wowed with the CG visuals but turning everything else empty without much heart.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows didn't have a clear direction on where it wanted its narrative to head toward. It could have been a dark comedy, or a heavy tragic romance, or both even, but what turned out felt lacklustre and in some ways going through the motion. With the Burton-Depp-Elfman axis in the past, one would have come to expect more, and unfortunately this collaboration was steps backward."

"ferguson-6","6","1","2","20 May 2012"," Season of the Witch
","Greetings again from the darkness. If anyone ever asks ""What was the name of that late 60's goth, supernatural soap opera with the cult following?"", it's safe to assume they mean the TV series ""Dark Shadows"". It ran from 1966-1971 for a remarkable 1225 episodes. For those who remember it, the image they recall tends to be actor Jonathan Frid as Barnabus Collins ... the first vampire any of us ever saw outside of a Friday night horror film. The series made quite an impact on two young boys in particular: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>There are many reasons that movies get made. Pet projects or labors of love are not as common these days because of high production costs. But that's exactly what this movie is - a pet project for Burton and Depp. They clearly have fun with the characters, and the film dallies ever closely to the parody line. The initial set-up is brilliant and dark and ominous, leading us to believe this film will be in line with Burton's Sleepy Hollow or Corpse Bride. Instead, the rest of the movie is more in line with Beetlejuice. Definitely not a bad thing - just different than what we were prepped for.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance as Barnabus Collins, the rich young man cursed by Angelique, the witch he spurns in love. His curse is to be turned into a vampire and buried alive. When his casket is discovered 196 years later, the world of 1972 is quite different than the one he left. He comically struggles to fit in and make sense of it all ... not the least of which is his remaining family. At his beloved Collinswood Manor lives Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer), Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller), Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), David Collins (Gulliver McGrath), the live-in child psychiatrist Dr Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), and their recently hired nanny Victoria (Bella Heathcote). While he was buried, the wicked witch Angelique (Eva Green) becomes the most powerful figure in town.<br/><br/>Burton does a nice job poking fun at the 1970's with comedy that won't mean much to today's youngsters, but will hit home with those from the era. The art direction and sets are terrific, especially Collinwood Manor. The music of the 70's is used to comic effect, including a live performance by Alice Cooper. Michelle Pfeiffer does the best job at capturing the look and feel of the original series, but her daughter's character (Moretz) takes an unnecessary turn as Burton tries to cram as much in as possible. In fact, the film is actually quite fun to watch, but is lacking real substance in the story department ... not dissimilar to the original series.<br/><br/>This is the 8th film collaboration between Burton and Depp. They make a wonderful team, and Depp has added another entertaining character to his Captain Jack Sparrow, Edward Scissorhands, Mad Hatter legacy. His movements and speech pattern are especially entertaining as we are mesmerized by his milky white complexion. His dialogue (written by Seth Grahame-Smith) demands attention and is both comical and majestic simultaneously. Burton's tribute to the TV series includes cameos by four of the original actors: Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby as guests at the ball. It's a classy touch. Danny Elfman's score is a bit overwhelmed by the use of numerous 70's classics, and it was disappointing to hear The Killers version of ""Go All the Way"" rather than The Raspberries as the closing credits rolled.<br/><br/>Burton is one of the more visual directors and even though the story is a bit lacking, each scene gives us plenty to absorb. The ghosts are especially well done, as is the fishing town of Collinsport which was built just for the movie. It has many similarities to Bodega Bay, which film lovers will recognize as the setting for Hitchcock's The Birds. Lastly, Burton gives us another scene with the great Christopher Lee - this time as a boat captain caught between Angelique and Barnabus. Good stuff."
"Somewhere_Out_There","6","1","2","16 May 2012"," I enjoyed it, but it could have been better.
","I really did enjoy this film, but not in a way that I had anticipated. What I wanted from this film was a more seriously Gothic-style film that was reminiscent of Sweeney Todd, Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, but it's a tad too light to be compared to those films. It was funny in some places, more serious in others, and at times it was almost like a parody. I was honestly a little disappointed by it. Chloe Grace Moretz completely ruined the film for me, as her character was incredibly over acted and just a little bit cringe-worthy. Johnny Depp was brilliant as always, no complaints about his performance at all. Gulliver McGrath was also awesome, and I loved his character, they should definitely have focused on him a lot more than what they did. <br/><br/>Although I have a great love and respect for Tim Burton, I have to say that it was almost like he was trying to put too much into the film, and there was so much going on that he'd lost focus on what could have been a really great story line. All in all the film was alright. It'll never be a classic like Edward Scissorhands or The Nightmare Before Christmas, and I think maybe Tim Burton should stop trying to create one so desperately and just calm it down a bit. Something more subtle and beautiful would be much more welcomed, I think, than another over-done production such as this. <br/><br/>Having said all that, it is worth a watch just for Johnny Depp, and the great visuals throughout the film. If you liked Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland, you'll probably like this too."
"velvoofell","8","3","12","13 May 2012"," Maybe Not Slavishly Faithful - But Evocative of a Childhood with Monsters.
","'Dark Shadows' is a TV show I was never familiar with apart from when Tim Burton and John Waters name checked the 1960s American Gothic soap opera in their 1989 UK promotion of 'Beetlejuice' and 'Cry Baby' respectively. So, to me if no-one else, Burton seemed a natural to bring a condensed homage to the show to the big screen. <br/><br/>Though having never seen the source material, I enjoyed Burton and Depp's 'Dark Shadows' as it evoked a childhood, much like my own, spent as an outsider even the Dungeons and Dragons crowd wouldn't have, let alone the football team - why throw a dice or obey a DM to become a monster when you could drape a sheet over yourself, bare your top set of teeth at bemused girls in the playground and be Christopher Lee, dive about a local forest on a BMX like Skywalker on a speeder bike or carry a plastic gun through a car park as if I was Shaft... OK maybe my parents should not have shown me a videotape of 'Shaft' at age 7.<br/><br/>What 'Dark Shadows' central performance, Johnny Depp as Barnabus Collins, was a refined version of, was the remotely talented kid channelling a vampire in play. Eva Green's all powerful witch Angelique had something of the same quality and so a brilliantly staged, professional version of kids at play was infectiously delivered on screen.<br/><br/>This sense of play from children of the nineteen seventies where the age of tweens truly took hold has been in other films. This was the personal, deep way films like 'Where the Wild Things Are' and 'The Muppets (2011)' were interpreted for the cinema. This is professional fan fiction writ large and with its heart on its sleeve. Depp may have been the very seven year old who aped Jonathan Frid's original Barnabus Collins while Burton may have been formed by the era of inventive exploitation movies and solid auteurs of horror. Kubrick's 'The Shining' is inferred at points in the opening exterior and intermediate interiors of the film while Donner's 'The Omen', Argento's 'Suspiria' and even 'The Godfather' are woven into the film's Proustian depiction of seventies life in a way, for example, JJ Abrams never quite recaptured the eighties in 'Super 8'. The music of the time doesn't just pervade the soundtrack - one representation of a werewolf is straight out of 'Ozzy Osbourne's 'Bark At the Moon' cover while a CGI-makeover-ed Alice Cooper struts iconically in one party scene and all but steals the show.<br/><br/>The soap operatics insist that character arcs from five series of a late sixties, early seventies TV show are condensed into one film and this is fairly well handled. I bow to the opinion of disappointed fans as I would never want, say, a big screen 'the Prisoner' to cram the whole slow-burn plot into one film. However the summoning of 'Dallas' and not a little Hammer (there was after all a 'Dracula: AD 1972')is present.<br/><br/>Overall a film to sate original fans of vampires, ghouls, witches and wolf-men who collected garish art cards and abandoned Aurora kits to swamps of glue. 'Twilight' fans can keep their anaemic teenage monsters."
"maiquedi","6","3","12","10 May 2012"," Hard to describe, but it barely saves itself.
","First of all, we might say this is a typical Tim Burton movie, and that might be just what saves it from mere mediocrity, because that seems to be about it.<br/><br/>This movie features a love story gone wrong because of betrayals and seems to be a bunch of 'clichés' all put together: a person betrays another, which just happens to be a witch and, for that reason, the female sorceress puts a curse on him... imortality. Now, the idea of ""eternal suffering"" (as a matter of fact, the main character tried to kill himself in the beginning along with his... AHEM... ""lover"") makes total sense, but it's been a little overused over the years - even by Twilight movies themselves -. Then Johnny Depp goes to a coffin, and that's about it for the background story.<br/><br/>As you would expect, some years later he returns and it's all about a bunch of fantasy creatures like vampires and stuff adapting themselves to the real world, which is also so unoriginal that I can't even remember which movies features such a plot line. One of the issues, in fact, is that they try to focus a lot on LOTS of characters, so some of them are left out and then come back all of a sudden (like ""Vicky""), in desperate need of 'spotlighting'. Also, it's hard to say whether the movie's funny, what are the morale traits of characters or messages the movie seems to transmit - in which sometimes the main characters just kill people for some unexplained reason - and Depp's performance isn't all that amazing.<br/><br/>However, what saves this is the fact that... the movie is somehow hilarious some of the time... the McDonald's symbol was well thought, Depp's dialogues are, a few of them, surprisingly memorable, and his ""formal and gentlemanly-said"" insults are typical Burton-Depp humor. So it's not that forgettable, it's just not that good of the movie... and don't expect to learn anything from it or feel touched."

It was way entertaining beyond all my expectations.<br/><br/>I really do love movies, although not necessarily all of Tim Burton's. And not even so sure he ""made"" it.

But here, this movie was spot on in the genre!<br/><br/>I haven't liked a dark creepy movie like this since Peter Jackson's ""The Frighteners"" (a classic in it's own right), and it minded me a bit of those fun ""Adams Family"" movies.<br/><br/>Johnny Dep Vampire was so compelling, interesting, and just humorously perfect creepy.<br/><br/>Now if it has much to do with the original Dark Shadows series, if I missed some spoofs, or inside jokes, I honestly could care less. I doubt it even matters unless you are a 55+ plus that really remembers the old show (and nothing wrong with that either).

","I saw the film the second week in May,when it came out. And I thought it was great. I liked this one better than Tim Burton's last two films. Anybody going to see this film keep an open mind (especially the die-hard Dark Shadows fans) that THIS IS NOT A DRAMA. It is a Dramady. Which is of course part drama/comedy. This film did have it's moments though. Like the climatic ending. And I know there has to be deleted scenes. I'm sure they will be shown on the DVD's.<br/><br/>The musical score by Danny Elfman was excellent. Including all the 70's music. The Carpenter's song, ""On Top Of The World"", went well with one of the funny scenes. Also the appearance of Alice Cooper added to the rock and roll feel of it.<br/><br/>All in all the cast was great, special effects, etc."
"Sciencemonster","7","2","7","23 May 2012"," Good, unexpected.
","Always a fan of Tim Burton, I easily enjoyed this film. However, one should not expect more of a comedy, as this film is based off of a soap opera. The humor is lacking a bit, but still prominent. The time period was developed perfectly, makeup fantastic, cinematography nothing spectacular. Acting, well just take a look at the cast! Although Ms. Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard does not properly portray both sides of her character blended well enough together. Eva Green does a voice... good for her character, but unbelievable as an actress. SPOILER: The final scene, with the Doctor's eyes opening, signaling her as a vampire, too cliché as it reminds me of breaking dawn part one, Avatar, and several other film endings, it's overdone. Overall my score: ""DVD Purchase worthy for Tim Burton aficionados, good classic film."" P.S. 3D would not add anythings spectacular, wouldn't be worth it."

","When I was a kid, I used to watch the Gothic vampire soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" after school. I was a little apprehensive when I heard a movie version was out, but I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and ventured out to see it.<br/><br/>I was quite pleased. In this version, Depp is the troubled vampire Barnabas Collins, who wakes after being trapped in his coffin for 200 years. He arrives home in 1972, returning to his family's mansion in Maine, and proceeds to attempt to straighten out the mess a curse has brought on his dysfunctional descendants.<br/><br/>What follows is two hours of a predictable plot with some great '70s jokes and sight gags. One thing that makes this movie enjoyable is it is played for laughs without being slapstick or stupid. The other thing that makes it go is the cast. Depp is again amazing as he marries himself to the role. Add in Michelle Pfieffer, Helena Bonham Carter and Eva Green and you have a cast that works well. Also in the mix is a cameo by Christopher Lee and a performance by Alice Cooper under the disco ball. Add it all together and this one gets a good three out of Fordyce. Go and enjoy. <br/><br/>Credit Check: Nothing happens after the credits, but stay and listen for the groovy song by Eric Carmen."
"spacemonkey_fg","8","2","7","18 May 2012"," Great Fun! One of Burton's Good Ones
","I've never seen the show, or the previous films, but Tim Burton's Dark Shadows was great fun. The comedy is not in your face, it's subtle and sarcastic and witty. The film is a slowburner, it's not action packed, but I don't think it was meant to be either. This after all is paying homage to all those spooky Dan Curtis movies and television shows, he was always about the old fashioned horror clichés, the fog, the moon, the ghosts, the giant mansion. <br/><br/>I thought Depp was great as Barnabas and is really what kept me glued to the film, Barnabas is a great character, the fish out of water elements were great, but so was the theme about trying to bring the Collins family back to it's former glory. <br/><br/>I salute Burton for not using so much CGI, this time, its only used when necessary. This time we get real sets, and not everything is computer generated. The art direction is top notch as is expected of a Burton film. <br/><br/>Some people might not like it when compared to the TV show, because this is a comedy and the shows were not comedic, but I think on its own merits, the film works and I consider it to be one of Burton's ""good ones"""
"Red_Identity","Null","2","7","15 May 2012"," Good, but messy
","I was disappointed in the reviews for Dark Shadows, since I hoped for a home run for Burton. Still, I went to see this, and am glad I did. It's fun and entertaining for the most part, but incredibly messy. The main problem here is the editing and pace. Whereas Alice in Wonderland's problem was that it was just weak all around in the storyline, it at least did move more coherently. Dark Shadows never really has a central storyline or purpose going, and instead feels disjointed and random. But although it does feel messy, it still has a lot of great scenes mixed throughout, and I think as for the horror and comedic aspect, it was handled appropriately. I enjoyed the cast a lot, especially Depp. So I recommend it, but it sure has a lot of flaws. It could have been put together a lot better, and it also felt like it never went ""all the way"". But, I actually did find it funny many times, and although I have not seen the TV show, I didn't find that the ambition was lacking here. It doesn't exactly feel ""lazy"" as Alice did, just a sort of mishandled film."

","A good movie with a mix of comedy and silliness! The story is silly, which is about a cursed vampire who returns to his home town. The vampire (Depp) is reunited with the witch (Green) who cursed him. The witch has the hots for the vampire, and creates much drama as the spurred lovers. The comic part of the story is the drama/tension between Green and Depp. What makes the silly comedy work is the acting brilliance of Johny Depp. Depp's line delivery, and straight face seriousness creates perfect comic delivery. Many other actors would come across stale by over acting the scene. The movie started out silly and ended stupid which equals great comedy. I give Dark Shadows a seven out of ten."
"DJRMewzique","7","2","7","12 May 2012"," Despite an excellent performance by Depp, like his character, the film is just a little lifeless.
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have a long, quirky history spanning over twenty years now, from the brilliant (""Edward Scissorhands"") to the disappointing (""Alice in Wonderland""). And although both have a resume with more positives than negatives, Burton still directed ""Planet of the Apes"" while Depp should desperately want to take ""The Tourist"" off his list (and while he's at it, every single Caribbean movie).<br/><br/>So, when ""Dark Shadows"" was announced some time ago, I was sceptically excited, as I assumed it would probably be great, but hey, both names have stumbled. Then Michelle Pfeiffer got added to the mix, and anticipation grew (because, c'mon, MICHELLE PFEIFFER!) and then Chloe Grace Moretz! Suddenly, May 11th, 2012 was steaming with excitement for me! So, now that the day has come and gone, how do I feel? Well, to be honest, slight disappointment.<br/><br/>""Dark Shadows,"" based on the uber-cheesy series which aired from 1966 to 1971, has all the right ingredients, but instead of cooking it on high, it was brought to a boil on medium, and thus watching it sadly became tedious at times. A few bubbles would pop up, but then you go back to watching a film that slowly heats up as you look at the clock.<br/><br/>Barnabas Collins, as played by Depp, returns to Collinsport in 1972 after having spent two centuries underground, having been put there by a witch, Angelique. After being dug up by an excavation crew (who suffer the consequences dearly), Collins returns to the house he built to find his descendant s still live there, although not nearly as lavishly as when he was ""alive."" Head of the household Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, played beautifully in a more-than-welcome return of the magnificent Michelle Pfeiffer, is struggling to keep the family above water. When Collins arrives and persuades her that he is who he says he is, she opens the doors to the family home to him on his promise that he will revive the family fortune.<br/><br/>A fortune taken away by the very witch that entombed him.<br/><br/>I have felt over the last few years that Depp had pretty much exhausted every quirky character he could. The biggest disappointment of ""Alice in Wonderland"" was that, for the first time, he brought nothing original to a role. It was merely an amalgamation of characters we had already seen him do. Such is not the case with Barnabas Collins. As a vampire waking up in 1972, I cannot think of a more perfect actor to play the fish-out-of-water scenario than Depp, and his execution was exquisite.<br/><br/>To see Pfeiffer back on the big screen (her last starring role in a major film was 2007's brilliant ""Stardust"") is nothing short of a dream, and her role as the family matriarch is nothing short of perfect. And the woman still looks phenomenal.<br/><br/>Chloe Grace Moretz (""Kick-Ass,"" ""Hugo"") never ceases to amaze me, and I cannot help but think this young lady could fill the gap left by Lindsay Lohan....that of a young actress with so much incredible acting talent, you cannot help but see Oscars in her future. As rebellious daughter Carolyn, Moretz absolutely controls every single scene she appears in.<br/><br/>Of course, for comic relief, the always pitch-perfect Jackie Earle Haley as Willi Loomis, not to mention Eva Green's just-fine performance as witch Angelique and an impressive major-motion picture debut by ""Neighbour""'s alum, Bella Heathcote.<br/><br/>So, with all this star power and direction by Tim Burton, why is my reaction not complete exasperation? As I said, the film just moves far too slowly. Despite excellent performances all around, a great story, a script that is clever and crisp and refreshingly funny while staying absolutely true to the concept of the original series in every way, it may have tried a little too hard to be as quirky and cheesy as the TV series, thus lending to a film that seems like an episode that was stretched just a wee bit too long. The whole knock at 1972 never becomes tiresome or less amusing, even though the film itself does as time drags on.<br/><br/>So, that is the one critique I have. A film filled with excellence in acting, writing and, with incredible special effects and outstanding cinematography, an absolute visual pleasure! But, despite all this, it just sadly took too slow a pace to get to the point. So, the film is good. Not great, but good, simply because Burton focused on the ingredients, and while doing a superb job, simply forgot to turn up the heat."
"laramnevoy","7","2","8","16 May 2012"," Good Fun for Vampire Fans and Dark Shadows Fans Alike
","After seeing this film, I'm bemused about the number of negative reviews it has received. They had me worried, but I'm glad that I didn't let them trouble me enough to keep me away from the film.<br/><br/>I was a devoted fan of the 1991 Dark Shadows remake, and that led me to watch portions of the original series as well. Both shows, in my opinion, are charming, though often for different reasons. The remake brings a great deal of emotion and humanity to the characters, despite their over-the-top situations. I always find Ben Cross' Barnabas deeply moving, in his anguish at what he has become and his struggles to return to something better. I love the interaction of Barnabas and Willie in the 1991 version -- Willie is terrified of Barnabas and yet fond of him and worried for him, too. As for the original series, it's been a long time since I watched it, but I remember being charmed by the actors gamely going on with the show in the face of the amazingly low budget and production values. And Jonathan Frid's Barnabas is a fascinating character, in his mixture of dignity, menace, urbanity and regret.<br/><br/>As a Dark Shadows fan, then, I certainly had my misgivings before going to see this version. To my relief, I found this film eminently watchable, a fun evocation of the vampire myth and an affectionate new take on the Dark Shadows universe.<br/><br/>Some of the negative reviews have expressed discomfort with Barnabas' killings in this film. But after all, he IS a vampire, and the vampires in this mythos are not the version who are able to live on animal blood or on only small amounts of human blood. And why should one insist on having a protagonist who is only a nice guy? The concept of the anti-hero is perhaps too complex for some viewers' tastes, but personally, I am happier with a protagonist who is deeply flawed (and perhaps in some ways abhorrent), than with one who is simply nice. Would I want to marry a murderous vampire? No. Do I want to watch films about them? Decidedly yes.<br/><br/>I wonder if many of the negative reviewers for this movie actually enjoy vampire films. For me, I have a hard time seeing how anyone who likes the genre would not like this film. It's delightful watching how Barnabas in this version struggles to find a comfortable way to sleep (perhaps reminiscent of the fact that the coffin Jonathan Frid had to use in the original TV series was too short for him), and the affectionate nods to classic films of the genre had me laughing out loud at times, for instance the Nosferatu-style rising from the coffin. Another laugh-out-loud moment due to its resonance with so many films of the genre is Willie's gasped-out line which is something like, ""Fire! Murder! Angry mob! Run!"" A few plot inconsistencies bothered me a bit, leading to a ""7"" rating rather than an ""8."" I thought that they did not think through well enough whether Barnabas is fatally troubled by sunlight or not -- he is bothered enough by it to burst into flames at one point, but at other times, he's walking around in daylight with no more protection than dark glasses, an umbrella and a hat. I also felt that the nature of Angelique as a witch/immortal something-or-other should have been more fully explained; I wasn't quite certain what kind of being the film-makers actually intended we should think she was. The broken glass effect as she becomes more and more damaged was visually interesting, but needed more explanation. However, questions like this were far from leading me to dislike the film.<br/><br/>I would say to anyone who enjoys the vampire film genre as a whole, and to any fan of either previous incarnation of Dark Shadows, to not be worried by any reviews this film has received. Take the chance, go see it, and decide for yourself."

","If you're not a Vampire fan, this movie is a total waste. If you are a Vampire fan, it's still stupid. I have an interest in the evil Collins family in real life, is why I wanted to see this. <br/><br/>The Collins family is part of the top 10 Illuminati family's in the world. They do evil rituals constantly, like kill little children and baby's in rituals. I have great admiration for the Collins family members that decide to give their heart to Jesus and leave the Illuminati. The Collins should listen to these family members that leave instead of killing them. 'Remember Tommy Collins' is a saying they tell their children at their evil rituals. Tommy Collins was a guy that left their evil family and was killed. Also Johnny Todd. The Todd bloodline is part of the Collins family too. Abe Lincolns wife was a Todd. Also Mitt Romney is from the Collins family bloodline. If you want to know more about the Collins, Read 'Bloodlines of the Illuminati.'<br/><br/>I thought this movie would be a Comedy like it said, and there was NOTHING funny about this movie. It's about a Vampire, not about the Collins. Vampires are not real, just like 'attack of the killer tomatoes' are not real. But then again, everything About the Collins is a lie and deception. Their whole LIFE is a lie. The real Count Dracula which Prince Charles is descended from, was a ruler that was a cruel killer and some of his enemy's claimed he drank blood, and that might not be true. Countess Dracula was the real killer who took baths in all her victims blood, 600 something, and a lesbian.<br/><br/>The best movie I've seen in a long time is 'The Three Stooges'. See that, it's way better. And to all the Collin's, please give your heart to Jesus."
"neil-476","8","2","9","18 May 2012"," Entertaining but typically odd
","House Of Dark Shadows never made it across the Atlantic, so my view of Tim Burton's Dark Shadows, a reimagining of the long running US Gothic vampire-based soap opera of the 70s is, of necessity, limited to the movie itself, and doesn't invite a comparison.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins, condemned to vampirehood by jealous witch Angelique (Eva Green), losing his love Josette (Bella Heathcote), and turning up in the 1970s to reclaim his place in the Collins household and business, currently under the aegis of descendant Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her family. Angelique is still alive and well, however, and just as malevolent as ever.<br/><br/>There are two main elements here. One is the power struggle and love tussle between Barnabas and Angelique, and the other is Barnabas' efforts to adjust himself to the 1970s after 200 years in a coffin. The former is a fairly serious affair: Angelique cold-bloodedly plays for keeps with silken malice (Eva Green always exudes an air of dangerousness, which serves her very well in this case), and Barnabas needs to kill people to live and is thus not an entirely sympathetic protagonist. The latter, however, is played very successfully for laughs. The question is how well do they fit together, and the answer is surprisingly well, actually. One might expect them to jar against each other, but they don't.<br/><br/>The performances are all good (Green is outstanding), with Depp, looking like DC Comics' character Klarion the Witch Boy (bum bum bum!), and spouting florid 19th century prolixity in a clipped English accent having great fun with a character which is only slightly less flamboyant (in a restrained way) than Jack Sparrow. Production design is, not unexpectedly, excellent although, as is commonly the case with Burton, one feels that style may have taken precedence over substance (Josette's story is overlooked for most of the movie, the startling development with teenager Carolyn (Chloe Moretz) springs out of nowhere and goes nowhere, the deus ex machina deriving from David is, again, left underexplained and, worst of all, there is an entirely unnecessary diversion involving Helena Bonfire Carter - Burton just had to shoehorn his missus in somewhere (again) despite the fact that her inclusion doesn't move the story forward one inch).<br/><br/>So this is quite enjoyable, but not without its flaws."

Even Christopher Lee makes a brief appearance along with Alice who well, I'm not sure has changed in the past 50 years..<br/><br/>Tim Burton is a master of the Gothic scene. His architecture in time, place, setting and sculpture is without equal. From the early success of Edward Scissorhands to his latter great Sleepy Hollow. He once again brings this uncanny, quirky and foreboding ability to entice audiences into his escapism with Dark Shadows, and he so nearly pulls it off masterly once more, but unfortunately where the film goes, where it entices us to be, instead stops in it's tracks and starts to drag.. then with quick explanation or none at all comes to a close and leaves you behind with quite a dull feeling of.. what was that all about? is that it? So I guess now, it's over.<br/><br/>I soooo wanted it to be more, but with such strong character development and premise from the get go, you expected more of the same from start to finish, but instead it rushes what it should have developed, and throws what could have been to the winds..<br/><br/>The film may leave you with questions, but perhaps they are not even worth knowing the answer to, other than perhaps, why?"

I found myself checking facebook during the movie and only looking up when I heard Depp's voice which was very entertaining. Helena Bonham Carter was good for what she had to work with and the two children in the movie were great actors. I guess I was just expecting much more, and I love the Tim Burton movies, and everyone keeps comparing this to all his other movies, but I don't see it at all.

Tim Burton and Johnny Depp wanted to recreate in this film the sensation of watching Dark Shadows, a soap opera that's known for its cheesiness and low budget. The film is supposed to be goofy and over the top; it's supposed to be dramatic in some places; it's supposed to be all over the place; it's supposed to have random, shocking moments, because that's what soap operas are like. I'll admit, I haven't seen the original Dark Shadows, but I plan to. I have also done research and saw some clips.

"moonspinner55","4","1","3","2 September 2013"," Depp is ideally cast as vampire Barnabas Collins...but overblown horror-comic is bereft of real blood
","Director Tim Burton and actor/co-producer Johnny Depp might have been the perfect twisted-twosome to expand Dan Curtis' Gothic television series ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-1971) into a theatrical feature. Unfortunately, what we get here is barely recognizable from the cult TV show, what with a bloated budget, a wandering narrative, and a misjudged pop/rock soundtrack. In 1972, the family-based corporation for an East Coast seafood company find themselves struggling financially; unbeknownst to them, their chief competitor is a witch who has held a grudge against the Collins's for nearly two centuries. The son of the company's founders, who spurned the romantic-minded lass in the 1870s, was turned into a vampire and buried, is ultimately released and unites with his relatives in turning the family's misfortunes around. Although Depp is the perfect choice for Barnabas Collins, the other characters and most of the action surrounding him fall flat. As the latest Collins matriarch, Michelle Pfeiffer makes some funny faces, but otherwise has nothing to do except address visitors from the staircase; Helena Bonham Carter, as a scheming psychiatrist, does what she can with a one-note role, while Jackie Earle Haley looks lost as the estate's simpleton groundskeeper (he's supposed to be under a spell, but I sensed the actor was floundering with poor material). All the dreary talk and plot-exposition leads to the proverbial special effects-induced showdown, complete with bodies flying upwards and backwards. It's too bad Burton chose to make this a slambang 'crowd-pleaser'; it doesn't have enough juice in it to please horror buffs, nor are the intermittent jokes enough to snare Depp's ""Pirates"" fans. ** from ****"

","It seems it's a different movie from Burton. Like Charlie and chocolate factory his aim is to show importance of family and love. He always mixes truth and fantasy with people's beliefs. I think here, the witch is a symbol of jealous people which want to destroy other's lives. Barnabas is symbol of innocent human which his life is destroyed by this jealousy. Mother is symbol of all mothers, strong and tending to keep family together for any price. The weird wolf girl is symbol of indifferent and careless young people today which in the hard time even though it is not expected, but they show belonging to the family. Gorget who guides Victoria to her destiny is the real fate which some people believe fate will guide them in life and there is sign if you look around carefully. At the end this is just love which can destroy the curse (even love between Barnabas and Victoria, and love between family members). Because the most powerful strength for a human is love, family and his believes. I think we should see this film from the other view. Against the all critics for this film, It is worth watching it."

","Burton's recent output has been underwhelming to say the least, but this is maybe his most middling effort yet. Besides Burton's usual visual flair, there's just not really much to recommend about it. The story is weak, the dialogue broad and dumb, and as a result the movie just isn't very funny. Doesn't seem like much effort went into the script. It's a one-joke premise: Depp is a vampire from the 1860's and is just so out of place in the 70's. He yells at the television and doesn't understand any 70's pop-culture references. It throws a bunch of broad jokes about hippies, hookers, and The Carpenters (he thinks that the band is referring to, get this, actual carpenters) and it crams in too many jokes about how he thinks Alice Cooper is a woman. <br/><br/>Depp is solid as always, but the entire cast around him seems to be just phoning it in. No secondary characters are ever developed past a single quirk each, so none of the misfit family members carry any weight or significance. They exist solely to scowl at Depp's Barnabus and say how weird he is. Helena Bonham's character isn't in there for any discernible reason other than that she is married to Burton. The story follows the standard ""fish out of water"" handbook and really reaches to stretch a trivial story to a 2 hour runtime. Many bad lines strive hard to be funny and don't connect: instead of kiss my ass he says ""I recommend you put your lips on my posterior and kiss it repeatedly"". Lot of wasted ink for such a stale joke. There's a lame third act twist straight out of The Munsters. And of course the vampire turns out to have a heart of gold and help the family deal with their problems in his own quirky way. And they all grow to love and look up to him. Not one of the worst movies you'll see, bud definitely not a good one."

","Strangely enough this movie was great. I cannot speak for its likeness or tribute to the original Dark Shadows series, but as a stand alone film, this works. I went in expecting an original twist on typical comedies these days, and in a sense that is what I got. The plot felt sort of like another version of ""Edward Scissorhands"" only, 20 years later with more jokes and less drama. Once again, Tim Burton puts Johnny Depp in a ton of white makeup places him in a mansion at the top of a hill and has him fall in love with a beautiful young girl. Only to be turned on by everyone except his family, near the end. And they all lived happily ever after. We think. Even the mixed era setting was very typical of Tim Burton - is it 70's? is it 90's? is it the present?. And though it has been done, it is consistent. It is Tim Burton. And I wouldn't have expected any less from him. Despite the fairly uninteresting storyline, Tim Burton did what Tim Burton does best, he brought together a great cast, great costumes and great visuals to create a fantasy land that is so imaginative it almost feels real. The humor isn't laugh out loud funny, though there are a few lines that get you, as well as some great physical comedy. What really drives this film are the visuals and the soundtrack. Once you get past the fact the plot isn't really going anywhere interesting, it is easy to enjoy. Don't go in expecting too much, and you will be pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Though it does help if you are already a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp/Helena Bonham Carter fan. When those three get together, either you love it, or you hate it. And I love it."

Angelique leads a mob to Collinswood and they drag Barnabas to a open coffin and chain him in the coffin and chain the coffin. and then bury it. when 1972 rolls around a construction crew uncovers the coffin and free Barnabas who promptly feeds on them. He returns home to Collinswood. And it is there he meets his family and the nanny. Victoria Winters is a young lady with a secret. But then again they all have secrets. The film quickly moves into Barnabas fighting to restore his family to greatness once more. and to destroy angelique for what she has done . He also struggles with his curse and fights to find a cure.<br/><br/>The Film is dark in some places light in others and it resembles a 70's vampire film. Still while it bears the names and the basic storyline it is not the TV Series. Dark Shadows the film is a honest effort to retell one of the classic Vampire stories of the Television era. Johnny Depp portrays Barnabas Collins in such a Fried like manner that you know he is doing this as a tribute to Jonathon Fried and a love for the Barnabs Collins character.<br/><br/>Worth seeing. I enjoyed it a lot because it was different then any of the films released in 2012. And that's a good thing."
"phd_travel","7","1","3","7 November 2012"," Quite delightful throughout
","Liked the story. It's 90% dark comedy and it works especially with the 18th Century vampire adapting to the 1970s. The humor is quite sophisticated. As expected the Tim Burton style and effects don't disappoint.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp carries the movie. Eva Green is quite good as the witch. She is better in these kinds of monstrous roles. What they did to her reminds me of ""Death Becomes Her"". Michelle Pfeiffer is still lovely in a natural way. Chloe Moretz is still cute. <br/><br/>Some reviews say it lost steam but I think it was alright. Could have had a bit more good lines from the supporting cast though. Worth a watch for sure."

","I was a kid when Dark Shadows started, and it was never on my radar. When I heard about it later I was very curious, and when it finally was syndicated on TV I watched a couple of episodes and found it painfully tedious. A 70s daytime soap with vampires is still a 70s daytime soap.<br/><br/>The movie version is decidedly faster paced, aiming for campy, silly comedy and cute special effects. While it's not as fun as Burton's Ed Wood nor as deep as his Big Fish, it is a generally amusing burlesque of 70s television.<br/><br/>I felt the last part of the movie was the weakest. Dark Shadows owes its success to not taking itself seriously, but towards the end, as the various dramatic threads come awkwardly together, the movie tries to both give viewers some flashy special effects and pull some emotion out of them, and it just doesn't work, both because it's not in keeping with the rest of the film and because the movie doesn't try hard enough to create that emotion. <br/><br/>But overall I thought this was quite fun."

","I saw the trailers for this film, and sadly did not see it in the theater. I couldn't imagine WHAT Tim Burton was doing, but this was most certainly NOT ""my"" Dark Shadows. The trailer made the film seem trivial and preposterous; a complete farce. Whomever was in charge of that trailer needs to be disposed of in a most visceral way.<br/><br/>The actual FILM is quite fetching. Depp is a star in this role as in most. His recreation of Frid's original character is startling, while maintaining a continuity between the two renditions. <br/><br/>The problem with the original soap opera is that it took itself WAY too seriously. It tried to scare us green, and it really DID entertain...while accidentally making us laugh from time to time. This film is fun and really took me back...in a good way. The comedy is campy and intended, where the original series had no intention ever of making one laugh, though it often did. The character development is sufficient without boring the audience into a long nap, and plot execution goes off seemingly without a hitch.<br/><br/>Continuity has a few holes, but this was done for fun and in fun...so who cares about continuity? I didn't. I was entertained. That's what film-making is all about. And, if it makes money, that's a bonus. LOL<br/><br/>On a more personal note, I genuinely hope they make another. I know the plates of all the principals are full, but would still very much like to see a run of these. A plethora, if you will.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows ala Tim Burton rates an 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>.: the Fiend :."

","I stalled on seeing this movie because I hated the trailer. It seemed to suggest that it was going to be completely different than the TV show, farcical, and twist on the Barnabas character. I hated the way Johnny Depp presented in the trailer and thought it in no way equaled the original Barnabas character. I expected to be bored and disappointed. Surprise! It was a fun, yet dark and fast paced and quirky movie that entertained, while bringing back memories of an endearing TV series that was loved by many. Johnny Depp was far better in the leading role than the trailer suggested and it wasn't totally all camp, although being a Burton film, it had it's moments. The story, while remaining largely in shallow waters (how much depth can you cram into one movie storyline?), did spin a plausible tale of Barnabas history and existence. I would have liked to have seen more about the storyline between Josette and Barnabas, and also why Angelique was spurned. I would definitely return to see more episodes of this tale (as we once returned to view more and more episodes of the TV series). From beginning to end, this movie was entertaining, fun, mysterious and kept a fast pace to keep you interested throughout. I recommend it for a fun movie night although, I'm not sure young children should be viewing it as it does have dark and bloody moments which could be frightening and too much for young children to be exposed to."

","When Dan Curtis did this series on ABC in the 1960's, he was not yet a top television producer. It was tackling the oddity of a soap opera about vampires 5 days a week that would later give him the opportunity to do major projects like ""The Winds of War"" on ABC. I say this because you have to remember the material from the original series is really not classic stuff.<br/><br/>What has been done here is like the series on steroids. There is more action in 2 hours than there was in 6 weeks of the old show. Thankfully the music here is much better than the original series which had music much like an endless rhapsody of murky swamp. I give the sound track and A Plus.<br/><br/>The film opens very well going back to the origins of Barabus Collins. The the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" (1972)is well chosen for the credits and the start of the 1970's, As for the train credit sequence, I have no problem with it.<br/><br/>There is a lot of subtle 1970's humor here which if your too young, you miss it entirely. I thought the entire cast is chosen well for the film. The sets and murky mood are well established.<br/><br/>The level of the humor is low but effective. The interactions of the cast is great. The script is a problem but considering the source material which is not great, the script is OK. The popularity of the 60's series was basically built around Jonthan Frid.<br/><br/>The movie tries to build it around Johnny Depp. To an extent that works as Depp's Barnabus gets most of the punch lines. That is about the most diversity Barnabus can get. Love the image of Depp almost looking like a famous pop singer. To sum it up, the casting, sets, and music including Alice Cooper are the strengths of this movie. The script is what it is. Watchable? Sure, I have seen much worse than this."

","So disappointing, how could you mess this up with such a great director, such amazing actors, visuals that were amazing (some SFX withstanding). The soundtrack was great, the acting was great. The only thing that let it down, and in a major game ending way, was the script. More and more Hollywood movies place less emphasis on a great script, and just worry about the sound/visuals, which is fine if it's a boneheaded action flick, but anything else it's just sad and annoying.

","The Burton-Depp sense of exotic humor is back once again, making a return after 'Alice in Wonderland' to hypnotize us with a vampire tale.<br/><br/>Imagine a man from the 17th century landing in 1972. Now imagine that man is Johnny Depp in a Tim Burton film need I say more? Based on the 1966-1971 soap opera of the same name, Depp finally realizes his dream of incarnating the role of Barnabas Collins, a 200-year old vampire. He returns to the age of rock and roll and hippie nonchalance to re-establish the once very successful family business. But an old affair- with a now powerful witch- isn't about to let some 'noble' blood-thirsty ruin her fish kingdom. If you think our intro is absurd, wait till you watch the film.<br/><br/>The film goes back to 1760, when the Collins' established Collinsport, a flourishing fishing port. They worked very hard on their family trade but gave their son Barnabas a very precious piece of advice; the greatest fortune of all is family. The wealthy young man grows up to become a Don Juan, breaking some hearts on the way including that of the aforementioned witch, the Collins's servant Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). When he finds his own true love, Josette DuPres, Angelique in an act of jealousy puts a spell on her rival, forcing her to jump from 'Widow's Peak'. Baranbas meanwhile is doomed to suffer for eternity as a vampire. Angelique then turns the town against him, and he is buried alive in a chained coffin.<br/><br/>Two centuries later he is accidentally released, only to find a troubled and financially ruined extended family. However Angelique was living happily covered in wealth and beauty.<br/><br/>History repeats itself in a different era, and the conflict is back on fire between the two former lovers. Baranbas's priority is to bring back the glory of his family history, while Angelique is obsessed with power at any cost. It gets even better now that she has a new rival who stole Baranbas heart away; Victoria (Bella Heathcote) who recently moved to the castle as a governess of the orphaned David Collins (Gulliver McGrath).<br/><br/>Besides the absolutely gorgeous 70's 'free look' apparel, versus the stark black Gothic persona, the outcome is ""Shakespeare in the Park"" (borrowed from 'The Avengers'), with the 1967 Moody Blue's hit 'Nights in White Satin' in the intro. The dialogue is Shakespeare meeting Alice Cooper, literally.<br/><br/>Recent reviews have been a bit harsh on the film, but guess what?

","Tim Burton's career has been kind of all over the place. Recently his last film, Alice in Wonderland, wasn't anything to get excited about, but this was a welcome return to form, if he ever had one officially, for Burton. The best part of the film is Johnny Depp having a great time in the role of the vampire Barnabas Collins. Eva Green also does well as the witch who cursed him. The film has flaws however with its uneven tone, not quite balanced between comedy and horror. Just a closing note: I thank the film for the Carpenters references and the montage featuring Top of the World. Thanks for resurrecting the Carpenters when they had seemingly disappeared from the modern culture."

","So, My initial visions for a Dark Shadows Movie; Something in the vein of Legosi starring Jeremy Irons as Barnabas and Charleze Theron as Angelique. We didn't get that. NO. But, what did the movie do. The homage in the beginning on the train taking care of the whole Governess role issue was funny, if you knew the show. <br/><br/>The dynamic between Angelique and Barnabas throughout the movie is a pleasant plus. There's what it was. Tension, some lust, but, no love. <br/><br/>There's actually very little comedy, unlike the sad commercials. <br/><br/>I was shocked by Roger Collins' in this movie. <br/><br/>Their Elizabeth Collins Stoddard was dead on. Michelle Pfieffer should be proud of this role.<br/><br/>What is GREAT is that he apparently wears 155 sunscreen and actually gets out once in a while. They actually get OFF THE ESTATE to somewhere aside from the Blue Whale! This they did well,and the story actually revolves around this. <br/><br/>The movie bounces in and out of Barnabas' relationship with Angelique and Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Dr Julia Hoffman was certainly changed a bit. If I didn't like anything it was how they handled her and Roger. But, on the whole, it's certainly a better movie than House of Dark Shadows or Night of Dark Shadows Theatrical Cut (the original Directors Cut would be better than this movie). <br/><br/>There's room to grow but I don't expect Burton/Depp to take a risk on a sequel or get the money for it from a studio given the gross take on this one. <br/><br/>Watch it, don't ignore it, if your a DS fan."

You were so scared because you never knew if that hand was going to do good, or do bad and your brother was too stupid to realize how important this was!<br/><br/>Does the thought of I-Ching wands fill you with fear, or does it fill you with both fear and amusement now?<br/><br/>Do these memories continue to fill you with anger and fear, or do you now look back and laugh at the absurdity of it all while still longing for the emotional intensities of the unique, Gothic, passionate soap opera that was Dark Shadows?<br/><br/>If you know and loved the story line of the Original Series, but also have the ability to laugh at yourself you are going to love this movie. It successfully combines the elements that made the Original DS grand while acknowledging it's inherent absurdness through the use of humor. I was spell bound AND thoroughly entertained at the same time while watching this movie.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. The characters were great as they were only altered from their originals to accommodate the humor that was added to this adaption of Dark Shadows. The story was based on the original but moved along quickly as it tried to capture some of what was told over a 5 year story line. The scenery was lovely and haunting with Collinwood, Collinsport and dramatic coastline resembling what the Original Series could only hint at with its limited budget.<br/><br/>If you are a die-hard purist DS fan who can still suspend your disbelief and want the same level of seriousness, intensity and characterizations of the Original Series, you probably are not going to like this film. Though it offers the same level of drama, passion, mystery and occult, it does so from a tongue-in-cheek perspective.<br/><br/>If you were not a DS fan and don't know the story line of the Original Series, this film is going to be fun, but feel wacky and convoluted because too little of the story and background can be told in a 2 hour film. But don't fret, it still offers great fun and entertainment with a soap operatic, Gothic format. Sit back and enjoy, and if it raises your curiosity to discover the Original Series, that is all the better. Go ahead and find out what it is that DS fans saw some 45 years ago and kept them hooked.<br/><br/>All in all it's a different feel and unique film because it deals with our ability to suspend our disbelief through the use of humor. The film that has managed to entertain me more than any other movie has in a long, long time. I'm glad I can laugh at myself and enjoy Dark Shadows for all the fun that it is."

","I really don't want to be that person but yea it was bad.(warning spoilers) Depp was a good actor through the whole movie as always but the movie was so corny. While watching I was thinking ""is this supposed to be funny or serious."" The movie was so silly but they wanted to make it serious. This man of the name Collins is turned into a vampire after he leaves witch ex girlfriend and so she ends up killing his new girlfriend. She turns the town people against him and they lock him in a box. He gets out in the 70s and goes home where he helps what small Collins family is left but making them rich again. You find out that his witch ex girlfriend is still in the town and making millions. While Collins is with the family he meets their governess that happens to look like his girlfriend that was killed by the witch. Later is the story Collins denies that witch bitch again and she turns the town against in and they lock him in a box. Until he loves her she will keep doing this to him.A boy from the Collins family let him out. He gets put and he shows the town people that she is a witch, then randomly you find out that the Collins family daughter was a werewolf the whole time, what the hell? Before the witch is defeated he tells Collins that the governess that he fell in love with is about to kill herself by walking off a cliff, just like his girlfriend at the beginning of the movie. Collins stopped her just in time but then she was like ""I will get old and you will be young."" She jumps off the cliff and Collins jumps to save her and bites her just in time to make her a vampire like him.<br/><br/>So now the bad part. 1.There was no real good relationship between characters. 2.Their teenage daughter was randomly a werewolf. With no notice it was like Wtf when did this happen? I did not see the show, if she was like that in the show, cool but not everyone who is seeing the movie will see the show. 3. It was to corny. 4.No one noticed that the witch was a witch even though she never got old and in her office she had portraits of herself through the years that I guess everyone thinks it is her ancestors but they all look exactly the same, that never happens. 5.there is a random ghost that is never really explained. 6. It was Tim Burton's twilight. There was a love triangle and a girl was human that wanted to be a vampire so she will not get old and she dies and gets turned to a vampire just in time. 7.The fake blood was really bad. When there was blood on Collins face it would not smear but water would splash on his face, or he would wipe his face. Also other blood you saw looked like reddish Orange pudding. 8. It was boring.<br/><br/>Really just wait to see it when it comes on TV."
"patryk-czekaj","7","1","3","4 June 2012"," An enjoyable vampire feast
","'Too many dull and hideous vampire movies are being produced these days'. Said one of the moviegoers sitting behind me. 'Tim Burton better deliver'.<br/><br/>I could really understand why he was so irritated. The waves of movies (and TV shows) about vampire-ish creatures of any kind attack us from everywhere all year long. I wouldn't mind if they were even half as good as old Nosferatu (1922) or Dracula (1931) with Bela Lugosi. The thing is, though, that vampires nowadays tend to be, how should I say, too pretty and shiny. They do not resemble the archetypal monster that was able to scare people away with a single look.<br/><br/>However, taking into consideration that Dark Shadows is based on a fantastic TV series (which aired from 1966 to 1971), and that it's built on collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, I thought that this might finally be a vampire picture worth watching.<br/><br/>Even though it doesn't actually share any similarities with the classic horror show, it still is an enjoyable movie in its own Burton-y style. The art direction, costumes, make-ups and sets are spectacular, as always. In its visual sense it's definitely a thing of beauty. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it lacks a bit in its storyline. The beginning is very promising, but it becomes less and less engaging as it runs towards those important, but not very promising, final minutes.<br/><br/>It starts off with a fine introduction of Barnabas Collins' (Depp) teenage years in a wealthy estate of Collinwood, and shows us why he had been turned into a vampire in the first place. We find out about the love that he lost, because of an overly jealous woman called Angelique (Eva Green). She was also responsible for putting him into a coffin buried deep in the ground.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 200 years. The Collinwood Manor is now a ruin occupied by Barnabas' distant relatives, including the family's fortune-keeper Elizabeth (Pfeifer), useless brother Roger (Miller), his grieving son David (McGrath), and a chilled-out 15-year-old Carolyn (Moretz). There is also the live-in psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Carter) and a drunken servant Willie (Haley). And how can I forget about the old lady that actually doesn't say a word, but steals every scene that she's in (the whole audience was laughing so hard every time she appeared). <br/><br/>After an accidental turn of events Barnabas is finally freed from his horrible trap and returns to the old house with a bang. I must say that with the minute Johnny Depp arrived on the screen again with his pale-as-a-wall face the movie become much more entertaining. The enjoyment he shows when he examines the marvelous architecture and décor of the Manor is so expressive and funny, that it provides for some of the best scenes of the film. That, and also his utter fascination with everything 1970's- style, like a Big McDonald's sign or a lava lamp (it sure looks like blood in a urine).<br/><br/>The burning scenes of fiery flirtations between Angelique and Barnabas show that even the undead are able to give out some of the hottest 'cadaverous cold' love-making sequences of the past few years. <br/><br/>All in all, I have to say that Tim Burton was once again able to make a movie that can yield a huge amount of laughs from the viewer. Even though Dark Shadows doesn't measure up to pictures, such as Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, it still shows a fair amount of potential in its ability to grasp one's attention. And Johnny Depp's acting, as the dignified and totally classy vampire (more Dracula, less Edward Cullen), is as neat and pleasurable as always."

Yes, it is. It is nothing spectacular, but it is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The characters are very wacky and weird in this film, which I like. I generally did enjoy Dark Shadows.

If you do, then i think you will love it. I have always been a fan of Burton, and his style. I am a Visual Effects student, and to me i find his style much more appealing that a majority. People complain about his constant type cast actors, BUT i think you'll find that its mainly due to a very good relationship between them all, and the fact the actors love to work with him, who wouldn't!?<br/><br/>I've not seen the TV series so i cant comment on whether they were alike or not, but i felt this film had a really good rhythm to it. It brought back my love for Alice Cooper, and reminded me of my childhood learning guitar with a Glam Rock lover teacher. I thought it was very good paced, i LOVED the VFX for it, and thought it was a great horror/romcom which is an odd combination, but done well by Burton. I think that with any other actors it would simple not feel right. The great thing about Johnny Depp is his ability to morph into a different character and you completely forget about his other characters in other films, as a posed to the awful acting by Jack Black, who will forever be, Jack Black.<br/><br/>A Great fun film that has really cheered up my iTunes! <br/><br/>Good Old Tim!"

Did the actors do a good job? Yes, most certainly. <br/><br/>Is this a family show? Most definitely not. I'd watch it alongside an older teen, but it's not a movie that's suitable for kids under 15 due to the adult humor, sex scenes and violence. But, everyone is different in their judgments.

Angelique places a curse on Barnabas to turn him to a vampire and put him in a casket forever. but in the 1970s construction workers find his casket and release him. he kills the workers, because of the thirst. meanwhile we see Victoria who we see in the beginning and then disappears then is the love interest for Barnabas. still we see Victoria go to Barnabas manor to help and emotionally disaster girl who's name i cant remember. another plot hole there and gone. in fact there are a lot of plot holes that are there and then disappear. such as Barnabas plot hole where they try to reprise the family business, then the love relationship between Victoria and Barnabas, and then the love relationship between Angelique and Barnabas. you notice that the try to squeeze all the plots from the show into one movie then either resolve them in 2 seconds or forget all about them. they rush through them to quickly. Tim Burton cared so much about the special effects then the story. johnny depp seemed to really try to make the film good with his performance and Jackie earl Haley like johnny depp does a great job and seems to care about the film. but this film is OK. its a popcorn movie. kind of like transformers. you can sit back relax and not think about what your watching. wait for the DVD."

"xsophiethekingyx","5","1","3","14 May 2012"," Average, nothing special.
","Afraid to say I was actually pretty disappointed by Burton. I have watched every single movie Burton has made from Corpse Bride to Edward Scissor hands. I love the cast, love the acting but the film seemed empty? Like there was no real story line, just about building up the families fortune and then some interfering witch. The trailer made the movie look really funny but i didn't actual laugh at all in the film. For a 12A it was extremely sexual and for any one with children who is considering watching this, expect some weird questions from children. I am only 18 and even I sat there and questioned the age rating. They made Chloe Moretz extremely sexual to the extreme it was sort of unnecessary? It is a movie that I would only watch once. Overall I think very highly of Tim Burton but perhaps this wasn't one of his best movies. Me and my friends came out wondering if we'd enjoyed it or not but it is worth a watch, the special effects are very well done :)"
"in_shahieras_prince","6","1","3","13 May 2012"," Entertaining. But just too Depp.
","Dark Shadows - It's good to watch Johnny Depp on screen. His acting could never disappointed you. Directing by Tim Burton - Official Page, the scenes of Barnabas Collins was first time in the world of 1971 after centuries left in the dark, lonely coffin, reminded me of his appearance in Edward Scissorhands. Especially when he was taking his first breakfast on the dinner table. Of course, listing Depp in a film would never make it less interesting. The other characters would certainly play so good role too. It's kinda a very funny humorous film implemented in a complete plot of the Collins-Witch revenges. It was a very nice story, and happened to be a very good use of CGI too. You would definitely find it very entertaining. Too much of funny part that I rather say nothing much but to ask you go watching this movie by yourself. It's 3 and a half stars worth. May be 4."

As far the plot it is pure Burton all the way! As a person that used to watch the show. I was not happy with the way he did this movie. He said that he watched and liked it yet he Burtonized it. I was looking forward to seeing it until I saw the adds for it and now I do not care if I see it or not. That was my mom 's view on the movie considering she was a fan of the show. However I can't say it isn't up to par with the original. So I am neutral I found it be funny in an off beat sort of way. So you see our views differ .

","I was hoping for another magical mix of atmospheric horror and Burton /Depp shenanigans like the perfect blend served up in their take on Ichabod Crane. I thought the prospect of a Vampire being brought back after 2 centuries would provide lots of opportunity for laughs and scares.<br/><br/>Alas this is another broad and oddly muted pairing off the jolly bad boys much more in line quality wise with their off-kilter (if enjoyable at times riff on ""Alice In Wonderland"". It has neither the scares or guffaws that might have given it some genuine life.<br/><br/>The first mistake was probably in settling for a PG13 level of depth and mayhem (though Burton and Depp obviously had a great time sneaking in bizarre sexual innuendo including witchy Green dropping down to give Barnabas a bit of undead oral attention). ""Sleepy Hollow"" worked for me because it's ""R"" rating gave the premise room to breath...and be as far out as B and D wanted it to be. This films seems oddly truncated and half hearted.<br/><br/>Another problem is the ""Gotta please the fans"" decision to devote gobs of time to back story...without bothering to give the updated characters any life or depth...(and playing fast and loose with the mythology at times is NOT going to win anybody's eternal devotion).<br/><br/>All in all entertaining and watchable...but not what it could and should have been."

"Christian_Dimartino","8","2","11","14 May 2012"," Depp and Burton strike again!
","It's strange to think that over twenty years ago, Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton first teamed up for Edward Scissorhands, the weird little fable that has grown to become a cult classic. As the years went on, they went on to make better films, such as Dark Shadows, the weird duo's latest collaboration. It isn't their best work, but it is better than about half of them.<br/><br/>Based on the cheesy 60's soap opera, Barnabas Collins(Depp, of course), a man from the 1700's who was cursed by Angelique(Eva Green), a jealous witch who lusted after him,to be a vampire, and is then buried for over a hundred years. Barnabas wakes up in 1972 and finds his descendants(which include Michelle Pfeifer, Chloe Moretz, and Jonny Lee Miller, to name a few) not living up to his family name.<br/><br/>Barnabas stays with them, and hopes to restore the Collins pride by re-opening his fishing business. But there is a problem: Angelique is still alive, looks great, and is his fishing business rival. And still has a thing for Barnabas, who simply just does not want her. She's hot, but she's bad.<br/><br/>Dark Shadows is fun. I love the mood of the film, and just how bizarre it is. Depp is perfect in this role. Nobody could really do it better. Depp has this sort of goofy charismatic charm that works in just about every film he's in. As a vampire on unfamiliar territory, you can't take your eyes off of him.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot story wise, but that really didn't bother me that much. I was enchanted by the many comedic moments and the quirky characters and the groovy 70's soundtrack, which mainly consists of The Carpenters. Dark Shadows is everything a Tim Burton film should be: Darkly funny, mysterious, and engaging. I wouldn't say it's Burton's best work, but it falls somewhere in the middle. See it, I had a lot of fun. Critics don't really like it.

","DARK SHADOWS (2012) *** Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Jonny Lee Miller, Bella Heathcote, Chloe Grace Moretz, Gulliver McGrath, Ray Shirley, Christopher Lee, (Cameo: Alice Cooper as Himself). Groovy ghoulies Depp and filmmaker consigliere Tim Burton reunite (and it's so good) again this time in a devilishly grand silver screen adaptation to the cult '60s TV Gothic soap opera about cursed vampire Barnabas Collins (Depp in a Pete Best wig and hamming it to the hilt) whose 200 year exile beneath the ground arouses his premature burial to save his family's business and stave off immortal enemy, witch Angeilique Bouchard (gloriously exotique Green whose funereal demeanor suggests the late great Conradt Veidt's ""THE MAN WHO LAUGHS"" {!}) – who once again has deigns for offing his reincarnated would-be betrothed (Heathcote). While Burton goes all out on Rick Heinrichs fantastic production design; long-time fellow traveler Danny Elfman's eloquent score; a pop culture 1972 riffing jukebox featuring nuggets by the aforementioned Cooper; and beautifully epically bleak/lovely cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel – the semi-campy screenplay by novelist Seth Grahame-Smith (co-story credited to John August and again based on the late, great Dan Curtis series) seems to run on empty by the climax yet a fun cast – particularly Pfeiffer as matriarch and confidante and Haley as the drunken caretaker cum Renfeld make up for the creaky groans of puns and vampire-out-of-water trappings none-the-less. Look very sharp in blink-and-miss cameos by the original cast including Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker, David Selby and sadly the late Jonathan Frid – the original bloodsucker, who passed away one month prior to the film's release)."

"Parks","8","1","4","5 May 2013"," In Defence of the Dark
","Having just read page after page of negative reviews, I thought it necessary to add this - <br/><br/>DARK SHADOWS IS A LOT OF FUN!<br/><br/>It's a campy, affectionate adaptation of a hammy horror soap from the 1970's. Granted, Johnny Depp is not Jonathan Frid, and the script never even attempts to give him that role. His Barnabbas is not the tortured monster of Dan Curtis' series, but a fish-out-of-water 18th century dude having trouble coping with 70's grooviness. Fans of the TV show may consider this a cop-out, but there's still a lot to enjoy.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is uniformly fun - from Michelle Pfeiffer pulling faces at the camera to Johnny Lee Miller as the stuffy, twitchy Roger. The romance between Vicky & Barnabbas is hardly present in the film, but that's because Eva Green dominates as Angeline - and she's absolutely terrific as a demented, lovestruck witch.<br/><br/>I think a big part of the issue people have with this film is that they were expecting a bit more darkness and a lot less froth from Burton. So try this - pretend you are going to see ""Robert Zemeckis' Dark Shadows"" instead. It'll give you a better idea of what to expect and if you just let go of your preconceptions you'll find yourself giggling through this as much as I did."
"bringlaurenback","9","1","4","24 April 2013"," A visually beautiful, surprisingly funny, retro romp.
","I fully expected to sleep through this movie. I was not a fan of the original Dark Shadows TV series, nor am I a big fan of Burton, but this movie was a very pleasant surprise. Perhaps too much of the amusing aspects of the plot were given away in the trailer, but speaking for myself, I felt there was still plenty to keep me amused. Was it on par with Citizen Kane? Please. But thank goodness, it doesn't have to be to be an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Is Johnny Depp's performance over-the-top? Yes, that's what makes this so funny. Did this story not deviate from the original plot in a significant way? Sure, that's what makes this so funny. Did this film not wallow in the cheesier aspects of 1970's culture? Yep, that's what makes this so funny.<br/><br/>The only issue I took was with the usual cheesy visual effects that Burton loves (think claymation), which to his credit, he kept to a real minimum in this film. <br/><br/>Visually, the Burton 'chiaroscuro' worked brilliantly, and the music by Danny Elfman, was perfect, but surprisingly different from his previous compositions which all bear a trademark style missing in this score. Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer & Helena Bonham-Carter gave excellent performances & the supporting cast worked really well. The performance by Alice Cooper was a delight, too. Eva Green's performance was the weakest part of this film for me. For a character that was supposed to be driven by love & revenge, she seemed a bit flat, one- dimensional & uncommitted. Perhaps the character was written poorly, but the performance didn't save the character. Jonny Lee Miller didn't sparkle in his role, but as he is a truly brilliant actor, I suspect the lack of sparkle stemmed from the script & possibly the editing. <br/><br/>The movie is light, tongue-in-cheek, witty & fast-paced. The violence & language were not objectionable for younger viewers, and the retro appeal was really well done. It's a fun, enjoyable family movie."
"jebophos","8","1","4","22 October 2012"," What an enjoyable ""romp"" this film was!!
","I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching this film! Is it cinematic genius? Maybe not in the eyes of most - but when I can laugh out loud many times and forget about the troubles of the day for 90 minutes - then I say- a job well done, Tim Burton!!! In an era in filmmaking and TV where we are all kinda OD'd on vampires - Burton kinda pokes fun at the genre and I LOVE it! Also, if you are a child of the 70's then this is a must see! The music (songs) are fabulous and there are so many ""kitschy"" 70's things thrown in that I may have to watch it again as I'm sure I've missed some. Operation game, lava lamp (particularly funny), ""Tiny songstress"" (Karen Carpenter on the TV)!!!!!Oh- and the percussion organ! Priceless stuff! Depp was delightful in this! I loved him! And Michelle Pfeiffer as well. Really the only character I had a problem with was the witch Angela but that was mostly because her scenes were sometimes bordering on the ridiculous. The ""sex scene"" was pretty lame - you won't lose much by fast-forwarding through it. Yes the plot is somewhat predictable but who cares? I loved this movie! Tim Burton is the one guy that can throw in enough weirdness and fun and macabre all into one glorious melting pot -and brew up something wonderful! If you want a fun, lighthearted movie - I recommend Dark Shadows!"
"Tcarts76","7","1","4","10 September 2012"," Burton makes up for his horrible Alice in Wonderland movie.
","Dark Shadows is an 7 to me. Tim Burton finally made something worth watching again. After what I felt was horribly over hyped Alice in Wonderland movie that left me almost upset I wasted my time watching it. I kind of went into this movie expecting not to like it. Tim Burton always has pretty stunning visuals in his movies but I usually get bored with his creepy, but almost G rated style. I usually just watch his stuff for the dark goth type sets and effects that he is known for, But easily tire of him recycling actors over and over again. His wife used to be a pretty good actress, but do we really have to see Her in a starring role in EVERY ONE of his movies?<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer was forgettable, and a few times I think I had to remind myself what her part was. The real star here is Eva Green. She is the center of attention in any scene she is involved with, even when its with Johnny Depp. Let's face it Johnny Depp is a decent actor but he only does dramatic over the top characters, so its not a stretch for him. He was good, but Green sizzles in a role that is a departure from her other films.<br/><br/>The comedy gags are alright but not to many. I know this sounds more like a review of really bad movie but its not bad. I would watch it again it was"
"ghost_dog86","3","1","4","2 June 2012"," Scarily boring.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland <br/><br/>As a comedy, ""Dark Shadows"" doesn't work at all, but as a film that goes out of its way to alienate anybody who hasn't seen the original 1960's cult soap opera, director Tim Burton (Alice in Wonderland, Beetlejuice) does a spectacular job. Not only does ""Dark Shadows"" fall well short of the 6 laugh benchmark, the eccentrically scattered tone of the film, which stems from this Seth Grahame-Smith (The Hard Times of RJ Berger) script, makes an under 2 hour film seem like a battle of attrition just to keep from falling asleep. Sure, Johnny Depp (Rango, Edward Scissorhands) looks like he had a blast camping it up as Barnabas Collins (his idol, no doubt)and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech) is ridiculously superb here as Dr. Julia Hoffman (for the ten minutes she is in this movie), but for anybody watching, ""Dark Shadows"" is almost entirely a disappointment.<br/><br/>Side Note: I understand, there are a slew of other A-list actors in this film, BUT if I haven't bothered to name them, then their performances undoubtedly did not warrant it. Simple as that.<br/><br/>This Burton production is a revival of the camp television classic ""Dark Shadows"", now set in 1972, when one Barnabas Collins returns back home to his beloved Collinwood Manor (located in the tiny town of Collinsport, Maine) only to find that his relatives have driven what was left of his once lucrative fishing company, into the ground. Now he must take down the rival fishing company in order to regain his family's prominence. Oh, and did I mention that the head of the rival company is a vindictive witch, whom long ago had cursed Barnabas, transforming him into a vampire after killing his one true love? Oh, I didn't? Wellno worries because that storyline really doesn't add to the entertainment value of the film anyways.<br/><br/>The idea of remaking this cult television classic may seem interesting on paper, but in all actuality, the plot here is nothing audiences haven't seen a hundred times before in a hundred other movies. A man (or whatever) from another time is somehow transported to the present day (or near present day) and we watch as he stumbles around, struggling with modern electronics for an hour and a half. So, even thought it becomes quite obvious 2 seconds into ""Dark Shadows"" that, for Burton, this is a labor of love, it all really doesn't matter, because the storyline grows more and more uninteresting as the film progresses. I will say this though; the climax of the film is very entertaining, if not extremely weird in a very ""Dark Shadows"" way. But the amount of boring satire one has to wade through is not worth the payoff.<br/><br/>Final Thought: I'll make this short and sweet. As much as ""Dark Shadows"" could not have been directed by any other director, this is clearly not one of Burton's better movies. This is not even ""Adam's Family"" funny. In fact, ""Dark Shadows"" may only work to reinforce the sad fact that the only reason many middle aged people loved the original series, is because they were all seven years old when they first saw it.<br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

","Everything, I mean everything that is good about this movie is in the trailer. Then end! Full stop! Well, there was the obligatory atmosphere and setting which I loved. The story and characters were there which I love. I love Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter. I love Tim Burton and Danny Elfman. I **did not** love this movie. In short, it was so disappointing and purported to be much more than it was. Besides big names, and big advertising, it was a flop. I did like some twists in the movie where Dr. Hoffman uses Barnabus' blood to make herself a vampire instead of giving him transfusions to correct his ""condition"". However, I thought it silly that the daughter Carolyn was a werewolf which was suddenly and ridiculously sprung on us at the end of the movie. Do not expect anything and you will be much happier for it because you will be disappointed like my friends and me."

","Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is a vampire, buried for 196 years and awaken in 1972. The witch who cursed him to this fate, Angelica (Eva Green), has control of the town that his family built from the ground up. Can Barnabas rally his existing family to defeat Angelica and save the fishing industry?<br/><br/>Director Tim Burton has assembled his troops. Dark Shadows features Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and composer Danny Elfman. All of whom are vets of his films. To retain talent at this rate, Burton must be doing something right. Unfortunately Dark Shadows isn't one of their brightest moments.<br/><br/>The 1972 setting is mostly disclosed through song. Dark Shadows is no musical, but the classic rock and pop soundtrack carries the movie more than any other single element. Don't jump too fast at dolling out credit; it's not that difficult to select songs most patrons are going to enjoy when they've had 40 years to grow on us.<br/><br/>Depp is good as the fish out of water. He's not fantastic and frankly, like most of Dark Shadows, his performance will go forgotten soon after viewing. It's not for a lack of production value, but more for an effort to mimic TV format. Now I'm not familiar with the television show Dark Shadows which this film is based, but it's too obvious that TV plot lines dominate the film. It boils down to Barnabas sleeping around and murdering to the point that a happy ending isn't just. If you're expecting a dark comedy, the trailer will suffice.<br/><br/>I honestly struggled to recall if I had fallen asleep, missing several touching scenes of between Barnabas and Victoria (Bella Heathcote), the young governess who has arrived in town just as Barnabas has returned. Perhaps the context is lost when it's glossed over via montage, one that focuses more on Barnabas struggling to find suitable sleeping quarters than their blossoming romance. It's something that a love story skips out on the heart.<br/><br/>There's a bevy of characters I'm not even going to bring up because they simply have no impact on the story as individuals. The writing seems to know this, making one a werewolf just to have something interesting occur. Again, I'm sure the TV series had time to hint at this surprise while this movie throws in an unwanted twist. <br/><br/>Tim Burton was at one time an auteur of unique vision, but for over a decade he's done nothing but remakes, reboots, and adaptations of established works. Dark Shadows certainly looks like his movie, combining a morbid scenario with white makeup and giant eyes. I can't help but think how magnificent it could be for Burton to apply his trademarks to new concepts.<br/><br/>Check out my video review as well as my other reviews at my site VaughnOnMovies.com"

","I have not seen the original series (though I am considering it now!) Looks like many people who are hardcore DS fans hated this film, so I suppose I can say: Don't go see it, if you are attached to the original. No offense to anyone, the film can still be very enjoyable regardless of how awesome the original series was/is.<br/><br/>There is a lot of obvious jokes, ha-ha funny stuff, but there is a lot in the dialog especially, that is understated and really funny. The acting was excellent from all sides, even the actress who plays the witch (I do not know her name, nor do I care to look it up...) was descent. Depp and the rest were great. One performance that didn't see a lot of dialog but was perfect was the sleazy brother (the father of the boy). The plot was hilarious and engaging. It was predictable on purpose. I wished that it was soapier, I guess, which would have been funnier. I think HBC's character was perfect, and the end was predictable, but oh so wonderfully promising. In fact, if it weren't the way it was, I would have been disappointed. Depp played something other than metrosexual pirate, which was perfect. The bad plot points were perfectly engineered to increase the soap opera effect, and I think served that purpose very well.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a hilarious romp, a soapy vampire farce that I really enjoyed. I suppose there is a sequel? Can't wait!"

","Definitely Tim Burton has made more exciting movies than this one but his talent to transform every plot and every era to his feet i think it's amazing! Dark shadows is his first movie that includes a vampire story and i think that went very well. He managed to adjust the Gothic scene in a season full of colors along with a Victorian hero. The special humor he uses in the film helped him to combine the hero of the Victorian era with the 70s. The sets,the costumes of all the actors especially Johnnys Depp i think that could not be better. Still, there was something missing in this film and i can't figure out yet what it was. Even though the end of the story was Gothic romantic, maybe something in the way to the end of the movie was not so good. I think that was a very nice movie with pleasant actors and exciting sets but it could have been better."

","Don't be fooled by the trailers, this film is a genuine Tim Burton product. If you are a fan of anything Burton has done, this is definitely worth checking out... possibly not full price, as sometimes it does seem like a film made by someone who is trying to make a Tim Burton film, but trying really really hard! Definitely not his worst, (Planet of the Apes), and at times seems more like an extension of the Harry Potter universe design wise, but it has all of the unique Burton traits... twisted trees on hills (Sleepy Hollow, Alice in Wonderland), creepy mansions (Beetlejuice, Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands), daddy issues, lonely misunderstood 'different' people, so, it is a smorgasboard of Burton, yet at the same time, very fresh and different. The Danny Elfman score is actually quite downplayed, it has good moments here and there, but takes a backseat to the music of the 70s (Knights in white satin, at the top of the world), and actually has a cameo from one real life vampire/music legend that is pretty cool... reminiscant of Tom Jones in Mars Attacks. In summary, this movie is really not that bad, but more of a drinking game of Tim Burton references than an actual Tim Burton film. (References to ""big Fish"" are less subtle."

","My last review on IMDb was of The Lucky One and I said it was one of the corniest, clichéd by the numbers movies I ever saw. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp may not be to everyone's taste as actor and director but at least they are always unique and original in everything that they do. They have made so many movies together that I bet they can read each other's minds. I never saw the original Dark Shadows series (although I think I remember seeing a Barnabas Collins board game in my fifth grade classroom). I can't compare Depp's performance to Jonathan Frid the original Barnabas, but Depp really delivers I think. He makes Barnabas scary (the scene where he kills those construction workers, those hippies and that doctor) however he also makes him strangely sympathetic as well. You feel sorry for him in a way because of the terrible curse he bears. Burton brings his trademark quirky brilliance to directing this film. He does a fine job mixing laughs and screams. However, there was just one slight at the end. I always watch the credits of the movies I go to see and I noticed that they didn't dedicate it to Jonathan Frid who just passed away. He'd a cameo in the film as well as three other original cast members."

Anyone who couldn't wait to get home from school or work to watch the original series will detest this film. It takes all the characters and storylines that made you sit on the edge of your seat in fright and awe and turned them into silly fools and comedy story plots. Someone needs to make a real Dark shadows movie, and make it into the spooky thriller the original one was. Even the comedy remakes of horror classics that Abbott and Costello did back in the day were still scarry in between the comedy. Such is not the case with this Tim Burton fiasco."

","I really like the original Dark Shadows TV series; it's got a nice eerie feeling and it was satisfyingly complicated. I didn't, however, catch the early '90s version or the 2005 TV movie, so when I heard that Tim Burton was going to be remaking it for the big screen, I was quite excited. The material seemed right up his street. There was no way, I thought, that this could be anything other than excellent. Oh, how wrong I was!<br/><br/>While a lot of the blame for how bad the movie turned out to be must be laid at the feet of Seth Grahame-Smith - and I'll go into why in a minute - there are some creative decisions that were surely other people's, or that people didn't question at the script level that just don't make sense.<br/><br/>In fact, this movie's main problem, I think, is that logic packed its bags and went on holiday during production.<br/><br/>You can make the world you create as a movie-making team with whatever logic you like, but, if your world doesn't operate according to the real world or by logic set out by similar worlds and characters in past works, you must explain that, or the audience must, and will, use their frames of reference. I might be looking into all of this too deeply, and the leaps in logic, inaccuracies and nonsensical stuff here might just be oversights, but there are too many of them for that to be the case.<br/><br/>But, then again, they must just be oversights and examples of shoddy writing, or else they would be explained. If I could have just turned my brain off, not thought and not listened to dialogue or not paid attention to the many, many illogical and nonsensical things in this movie, I might have enjoyed it more than I did. I doubt it, though; it's got Johnny Depp in it, who has definitely lost that certain something that made him a great actor."

","Dark Shadows is adapted from the same 1970s TV series, which has 1,200+ episodes. The movie focuses on Barnabas Collins, a human-turned-vampire who was buried in the 1760s, only to be freed in the 1970s.<br/><br/>While the series is really dark, the movie takes it a little bit more lightly and has very cheesy moments and some jokes that aren't really funny. It was interesting at first, then on the middle parts it just became dull.

","I feel even a six rating might be too high for what is essentially an uninspired, not that clever comedy. However, I was never bored and some of the jokes did make me laugh (often in spite of myself), so I cannot claim it's flaming trash.<br/><br/>The big problem is the script. It lacks focus. The opening is heavy on exposition and low on establishing characters-- and by establishing characters, I mean presenting Barnabas Collins as anything other than a poor sap subject to the cruelties of the plot. The love subplot is so underdeveloped that the filmmakers could have cut it with no problem. The family bonds are given lip service rather than exhibited through character action, dialogue, or ANYTHING.<br/><br/>Can't really recommend it, yet it's not as rank as its reputation would suggest. Some of the jokes are funny and you can tell Depp is trying to do something with the material here."
"Magow-Intermean","8","0","1","7 April 2019"," Dark Shadows Review
","1752, Maine. After Barnabas Collins (Depp) spurns the love of witch Angelique Bouchard (Green), she sends his beloved Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote) to her death, turns him into a vampire and then buries him alive. Two centuries later Barnabas returns and vows to restore the family name and manor to its former glories.
Tim Burton turned 14 in 1972, the year Dark Shadows is mostly set. Although it is based on Dan Curtis' late-60s supernatural soap (a prime influence on Burton's melding of the spooky and the kitsch), it can also be read as semi- autobiography. Not that the young Burton slept hanging from curtains or sucked the blood of hippies (then again, who knows?), but, as a teen weaned on Edgar Allan Poe, Hammer horror and Harryhausen, he must have felt a similar sense of profound dislocation to Dark Shadows' vampire, Barnabas Collins, in the age of Farrah Fawcett flicks and Disco (not Dante's) Inferno. It's this sense of alienation that Dark Shadows invokes, then plays for tons of fun.
For Johnny Depp's Barnabas, all Nosferatu hand gestures and Romantic formality, is a brilliantly realised anachronism rudely transplanted into the '70s, misinterpreting the McDonald's golden arches, freaked out by asphalt, completely bemused by the concepts of waffles and lava lamps. He is a man out of time who thinks the answer to any woe is to throw a ball and recites the lyrics to Steve Miller's The Joker as if it were Romantic poetry. As a kid, Depp used to run home from school to watch Jonathan Frid's Barnabas on TV. Here, he has fully honoured his hero, creating a funny, charismatic monster who is struggling to figure out what it means to be human.
Which is just as well, for Dark Shadows has a compelling central character but not a real centre. There are lots of story strands vying for attention - Barnabas' mission to revitalise the family fishing business, his wooing of the new housekeeper (Bella Heathcote), his sessions with Helena Bonham Carter's live-in psychiatrist - but ultimately all get short shrift. The overarching story charts Barnabas' passionate feud with witch Angelique (Eva Green, looking the part rather than owning it) but, save a memorable Barry White-scored sex scene, this feels repetitive and never really catches fire. Michelle Pfeiffer adds grace and class as head of the household Elizabeth, but the rest of the family, from Jonny Lee Miller's bad-egg brother and Chloë Grace Moretz's wild-child daughter to Gulliver McGrath's troubled son, never really register as they should.
Yet the biggest problem lies with tone. The TV show was renowned for its Ed Wood-like shonky sets, strange line readings and booms in shot, yet Burton eschews this in favour of high-end production value - Collinwood Manor is production-designed to within an inch of its life and Danny Elfman's score impressively broods- played against a stylised acting approach that hints at the show's amateur origins.
Beyond the vampire-in-the-'70s schtick, Burton's love of full-on Gothic flash and thunder (the prologue goes full Sleepy Hollow) and the gruesome (Barnabas' murder of some hapless workmen would sit right at home in Let The Right One In) gets full reign. Yet the director and screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (Pride And Prejudice And Zombies, Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, so he has previous with monster mash-ups) never corral the comedy, the horror, the family saga and the Gothic romance into a completely satisfying brew; it all feels about five per cent off. Perhaps the film it most resembles, especially as it moves towards its CG-fuelled climax, is Death Becomes Her, an entertaining if oddball mélange of the dark, the comedic and the blockbuster."

","If you are a fan of the TV show Dark Shadows, you probably won't like this movie. In the tv show, Barnabus hated being a vampire. He was trying to find a way to become human again. In this show, Barnabus is a blood sucker. Totally opposite of the show. In the movie, Vickie Winters and Maggie Evans are the same person. In the show, they are two different people with two completely separate roles. The only thing this movie had in common with the TV show is the characters had the same names.

"newpony","2","0","1","25 March 2018"," This movie is a travesty and an insult to the original show!
","I have never been so disappointed and angered by a movie in my life! Dark Shadows was one of the greatest TV shows/soap operas ever made, and this movie did nothing to honor its legacy at all. It was a giant piece of smelly crap! I used to run home from school every day to watch the original Dark Shadows on television at 4 p.m., and it was a thrill for me and every other fan who adored the series and the cast. All of the fans were heartbroken when the series ended. In later years, we were able to buy the series on DVD (the only soap opera ever made available to purchase). We were able to buy the Dark Shadows movies, and an attempt to revive the series in 1991 with actor Ben Cross failed, but at least it was a genuine attempt to stay as true as possible to the original series.<br/><br/>The problem is that you simply can't remake something as classic, unique and ground-breaking as the original Dark Shadows. In fact, most movies that try to retell classic TV shows fail, with just a couple of exceptions.<br/><br/>This movie was so boring and so bad that it probably made Dan Curtis roll over in his grave. For those who don't know, Dan was the creator of the original Dark Shadows. Johnny Depp is a fine actor, but he's no Jonathan Frid. I respect his attempt, but it fell way short.<br/><br/>The original series was not a comedy and the lame attempts at comedy were an insult to a classic series that was anything but comedic. The fact that four of the original cast members made a brief cameo in this movie simply proves that they had respect for Tim Burton by accepting his invitation to appear, but most likely they were paid handsomely to appear as well. Who can blame them? Also, I want to say that I have enjoyed many of Burton's other movies. He just should have passed on this one.<br/><br/>I only know that I did not like this film at all. I'm sorry I watched it because it took me 6 years to break down and do so, and I got exactly what I thought I'd get. A horrible experience. Just leave the original Dark Shadows alone! It will live on and on and on without any help."
"david_hokey_16","4","0","1","15 October 2017"," Fancy costumes and set; no story at all
","I wanted to like this film so much but it suffers from so much clutter. The only character that gets enough screen time is Barnabus and while the story is supposed to focus on some kind of love developing between he and Victoria she gets very little developmental. Many characters are wasted - such as Roger and Dr. Hoffman - and whether intentional or not given the soap opera background the acting was far too over the top by actors that are supposed to be amazing, ie Depp and Pfeiffer. It's sad when the children are the only ones who turn out a good performance though I must say Eva Green didn't disappoint. It's just too bad that her decent performance is muddled with ridiculous attempts at being comedic such as the sex scene with Barnabus. Going along with that it seems as if Burton only made Barnabus into a killing and screwing machine (what was the purpose of the bj the doc gave him again?) whose intent to see his family thrive and his curser squirm was just an afterthought rather than a driving force. Everything in this film felt so misplaced and rushed. The comedic timing was awful. The only reason I'm not dropping a point off my rating is because the end fight was actually entertaining (though we had to suffer to get to it) and the technical aspects were decent. After having Victoria willing to kill herself for the vampire we never actually saw her fall in love with (rush, rush, rush) and then taken over by the ghost of Barnabus' old love I wanted to just drop the rating even lower for the sheer stupidity, but I'm being fair here. If only this film were more fair to its audience."

They rebooted it as a comedy, just like what they did with 21 Jump St. The movie is about a rich European immigrant business man who was turned into a vampire by a witch who loved him, and stuffed in a coffin for a few hundred years, only to be freed during the 70s and help his descendants and blah, blah blah.

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","1","1 August 2016"," Good moments of dark humor in a regular comedy.
","Barnabas Collins has a huge fortune and a great future but he turns out to be cursed by a witch, whose love he despised, becoming a vampire. Now, centuries after his disappearance, he will try to return to his ancestral home in order to protect his descendants. Directed by Tim Burton, it has screenplay by Seth Grahame-Smith. The cast is headed by Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green.<br/><br/>This is the film adaptation of an old soap opera. First, I must say I never saw the original series, so I can not make comparisons. But one thing I noticed: as this film is a dark comedy, many people did not like it because they expected to watch a horror movie or a thriller. This happens especially when we know the story from a book or previous film. But that does not make it a bad movie. As I had no expectation, I watched it as a comedy and really liked it. The dark mood is rare because it is controversial, but this movie is full of good comic moments without breaking with political correctness.<br/><br/>The script works on a regular basis, it should have been more reviewed and worked. There are a handful of dubious elements, poorly explained situations and plot holes throughout the film. The provision of the actors was positive, but Johnny Depp's performance in the lead role, overshadows almost all colleagues. Actor experienced and proved in terms of versatility, he is able to do almost any role. Eva Green was also perfectly at the height of her role, giving an icy sensuality to the villain. The scenarios are excellent, particularly Collinwood, whose Gothic and sinister environment has lots of charm. I'm not a big fan of the seventies, but the epochal recreation seems to me dubious and untidy. Most of the scenes seem so much like the present that the audience quickly forgets the story takes place in the past. The cinematography is good, alternating darker and gray tones with more colorful scenes in order to emphasize sensations. The visual and sound effects are good. In turn, the soundtrack has coordination problems between the original track, made for the movie, and music pieces from the seventies that arise in the film and obfuscate soundtrack."

","Fans (like me) of the original ""Dark Shadows"" TV series need to remember, this is not an episode of that series, or an original storyline or continuation of it. I think that's what most fans came into this looking for. It is instead (as most Burton films are) a tribute to, or more correctly a parody of, the series, and specifically a parody of the Barnabas Collins vampire storyline.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does the character justice for the material he is given. The actress who plays Dr. Julia Hoffman really does not: regretfully, she is no Grayson Hall and therefore doesn't bring the same air of mystery and near-foreboding to the part. Part of that may be due to the scripting though, and the comedic air which is brought to the film in scenes where it seems a bit out of place (for example, when Barnabas attacks a group of teenagers because he needs to feed). The actress who played Angelique also suffers from the same shortcomings (Lara Parker was much better in the role).<br/><br/>The film is appropriately timed at the ending up at Widow's Hill, and in the beginning, but throughout suffers from uneven pacing and seemingly a bit confused direction. Word to all DS fans: Relax, it's a parody, have a bit of fun with it on a Friday night over your favorite beverage or two. Don't expect serious drama and you'll enjoy it fine."

I like most of the actors here, particularly Depp who may be controversial at times but always creates interesting and entertaining characters. His vampire character here isn't too far removed from his Captain Jack Sparrow roles.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is Barnabas Collins who in the late 1700s comes to America with is family. They settle on the coast of Maine, develop a canning industry and they are responsible for the town of Collinsport springing up. <br/><br/>As a young adult Barnabas is in love with a pretty young lady who from a spell lets herself go over an oceanside cliff to her death on the rocks below. Barnabas follows her but he also has a spell cast by a witch and now he is a vampire, so he survives. But then he is trapped and put into a spell that results in his being imprisoned and buried deep in a coffin. He stays there for over 200 years.<br/><br/>Near present time during excavation for a construction project they hit an object, it is the long-buried coffin with Barnabas bored, hungry, and waiting to get out. Of course he also has to see all the men are dead otherwise his identity would be obvious.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't take itself seriously. Barnabas finds the witch is alive and in the community, determined to finish him off. He meets a new young lady, the new governess, who appears to be the reincarnation of his lady that died all those years ago over the cliff. <br/><br/>The movie has a great cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter (doing her barely passable American accent), Eva Green (letting her French accent show often), Jackie Earle Haley (one of my favorites), Jonny Lee Miller ( doing a good American accent), and Chloë Grace Moretz as Carolyn Stoddard who we find out is a Werewolf.<br/><br/>Just fun entertainment, not a serious movie at all.

"bowmanblue","7","0","1","28 February 2015"," The jury's out
","I like Tim Burton, I like Johnny Depp and I like vampires. Hence Dark Shadows was always going to be something I watched. The film is based on a little-known TV show where Depp plays a vampire who's been buried alive for two hundred years and awoken in the seventies, where he tries to rebuild his family's fortunes while fending off the witch who originally buried him.<br/><br/>Having watched the film, I'm still kind of in two minds whether I liked it or now. There were some bits that were really good. If you've seen anything by Tim Burton, you'll either love or hate his Gothic fairytale style (which is, once again, evident here). Depp, as usual, puts in a good performance. However, it seems he's trying a little hard to be different with some not particularly good dialogue. A lot of his 'acting' in this involves him waving his fingers in a semi-threatening manner.<br/><br/>I couldn't work out whether the film is trying to be a comedy or a drama, but with horror elements thrown in there as well (and a kind of 'action' end standoff/battle). The film seems to lurch from one genre to another. There are some funny moments utilising the fact that Depp doesn't understand the world he's now living in, but they're few and far between.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, but I'm not sure how. Just like I'm not sure I'd be in much of a hurry to see it again. It's even left slightly open for a sequel, however with the mixed reviews (which now, having seen the film, I can fully understand) it's probably in some doubt whether there's any more Dark Shadows to come.<br/><br/>Although, it was great to see Alice Cooper rocking out in a film again!"

It looks great and you'll get a lot of laughs out of it, enough to forgive the end which sort of comes out of nowhere and unfortunately does not follow up with some of the charm it had earlier on.

"fedor8","Null","0","1","9 December 2014"," Was this an autobiographical movie by Tim? Is this about the spell cast on him to marry Helena Bonham Carter?
","Quite a depressing prologue for a comedy, huh? Burton has talent to spare in the visual department but he still gets confused about the basics. He should have gone either for a comedy - a spoof of the vampire genre - or for a horror story.<br/><br/>""It is said that blood is thicker than water,"" says Depp in the prologue and the epilogue. Well, blood IS thicker than TALENT – that much is certain - at least in nepotism-encased, in-bred, elitist Hollywood. Hell-ena Bonham Carter is the great-granddaughter of no less than a former British Prime Minister and has a movie director in her corrupt lineage as well (no doubt a career handed to him on a plate by his famous head-of-state relative), whereas Eva Green's mother was a French movie actress. Both of them suck, and I don't mean blood.<br/><br/>Aside from dazzling visuals and occasionally original movies (though quite a few duds as well), Tim Burton has been displaying two other very obvious traits over the course of his career: one very positive, one very negative. The Positive: casting Depp for most of his movies. The Negative: casting his useless wives in all of his movies. Will Angelique Bouchard please be of some use finally and throw a curse at the Burton-Bonham marriage? As long as these two are married (and God only knows what accursed spell was thrown onto poor gullible Tim to make him fall in love with the blue-blooded little English goblin), he will keep on casting Hell-ena in EVERY single damn movie he makes. Angelique, you bloody witch, how about making him drink Love Potion no. 8 – the one that makes nerds fall in love with a hot new actress such as Amanda Crew (for example)? That would significantly improve his love-life, but much more importantly it would finally remove the dreary-looking, overrated cartero-bon(dis)harmonious Orc from all his future projects.<br/><br/>Is Eva Green supposed to be some kind of a sex-kitten? For all those of you who have seen her walk around butt-naked in ""Dreamers"" – a movie for which she agreed to degrade herself like a jackass hooker for Bertolucci – she has (or had) a spectacular set of knockers, but her face leaves much to be desired. At best, she is pretty-ish, at worst (when she smiles ear-to-ear for example, like some Julia Roberts demon) she's hideous. Burton could have hired a far more competent and sexy actress for this role, but I guess he has become a Hollywood elitist himself, what with marrying ""blue-blooded"" princesses and the like. Eva's role is anyway a fairly simple affair; mugging and overacting is needed in abundant supply, which Eva provides, albeit in mediocre fashion.<br/><br/>I know this is just a comedy-horror fairy tale, but giving the witch THIS much power? There must be some sort of a ""silly horror flick superpowers limit"" as to how much magic one witch can wield. Eva Green is given so much power that realistically she should have been ruling the world by the time Depp's 196-year imprisonment ended, not some meaningless little fishing hamlet. What would a witch want with fish, anyway? If it's money she's after, she should have become the female Bill Gates. Nor did I understand why Depp didn't immediately get on with killing Green as soon as he was released from captivity – rather than wait like a moron until she very predictably struck again.<br/><br/>I do expect some semblance of logic even from a movie such as this. However, Burton quite clearly pays little or no attention to such details.<br/><br/>Depp is terrific as the vampire, and gets nearly all the laughs – most of which are located in the first half of the movie. The segment during which Depp discovers his New World dominates the movie in quality, although to be fair the visual quality is so high that it alone makes the movie very watchable even during its weaker moments – such as Eva Green overacting and grinning hideously or that embarrassingly cheesy Alice Cooper segment."

The battle for the town begins.<br/><br/>I went to see this in IMAX when it was released, I remember liking it but being slightly disappointed. The trailer makes it look like a full on comedy, but it's not really. There are some very funny comedy moments in it, but most of them were in the trailer.<br/><br/>The story was really good. I like the rivalry between the vampire and the witch. There is a sexual tension between them, but even though there is that tension there, he really doesn't like her. It is a weird relationship.<br/><br/>The casting was very typical for a Tim Burton film. Johnny Depp stars as Barnabas. Johnny has starred in a lot of Tims films. I have read some negative comments about that, but I disagree. I see them working together and it is a winning combination. If a partnership works, then why break it up? If you look at the films they have made together I can honestly say that I like all of the films they have made... even the remakes that Tim has done. I am not a fan of remaking a film and I was very dubious about it when Tim started making remakes, but I do like the ones he has done. Helena Bonham Carter also stars in this with Johnny. I know... no big surprise. But again, it works. Michelle Pfeiffer, Jonny Lee Miller, Eva Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Bella Heathcote, Chloe Grace Moretz and Gulliver McGrath star. The acting was quite good throughout, but again, the annoying one was Chloe Grace Moretz. She has yet again proved she can't act. It is a shame, but I really don't see what people see in her. Her lines seem so forced and it feels like she is reading every word she says. It was good to see Michelle Pfeiffer in a Tim Burton film again. The last film the made together was Batman Returns. There is also a great cameo by Alice Cooper and Christopher Lee.<br/><br/>It was also really good to see the original cast of the TV series made a small appearance. Jonathan Frid filmed his scene and unfortunately died before the film was released.<br/><br/>The effects were really well done. The end of the movie is where the effects are really shown to it's full capacity. Eva Green's character starts cracking and it is really well done.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this film is great. The movie is set in the 1970s so all the way through the film you have some classic 70s songs. They really do go well with the film.<br/><br/>This is a good film that is a lot of fun to watch... but don't see it thinking it is a laugh out loud comedy, it is more of a fantasy film.<br/><br/>I will give this 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""You may strategically place your wonderful lips upon my posterior and kiss it repeatedly!""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"bugandlolly","7","0","2","11 July 2014"," I enjoyed it
","I've read so many negative reviews of ""Dark Shadows"" that I just wanted to add my 2 cents. I enjoyed this film, especially the look of it. The set design, I think, was brilliant and the interior shots of Collinwood simply beautiful. And I also enjoyed the cast. This film is based on a TV soap opera that I was addicted to back in the day. That said anyone who watched Dark Shadows on television knows the program was riddled with problems. It was very low budget and props gave way, actors forgot their lines, booms and lights often appeared on screen and the story wound its way to hell and back. But those were not the things that mattered to me. It was the atmosphere of the show I loved and its Gothic theme. Yes, the ""Dark Shadows"" film is flawed but I found it entertaining. It captured some of the ridiculousness of the television show while elevating the production value off the chart. If you like darkly brooding yet luscious sets combined with well acted quirky characters and a generous dose campy humor you might enjoy this film too."

","I would run home from school, literally run, to watch Dark Shadows with Jonathan Frid. It, Les Crane, and Dick Cavett were my must-see TV.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is wonderful as Barnabas with some hysterical lines (i.e.: upon seeing Alice Cooper, ""ugliest woman I've ever seen""). His performance as the anachronistic Barnabas is nothing less than spectacular. Helena Bonham Carter as Julia Hoffman was a great bit of casting as well. And seeing Jonnie Lee Miller (Elementary's Sherlock Holmes)as the sleazy Roger Collins was great. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well.<br/><br/>Others may see Dark Shadows as an insult to the memory of the TV show, but I see it as both a wonderful homage and an entertaining send-up of both the show and the times.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, enjoy or not. It's your choice. I choose to be entertained by it."
"g-bodyl","8","0","2","19 December 2013"," Entertaining And Campy!
","It seems like most people despise this movie because it's a comedy, and not the serious TV show it was based off back in the 1970's. Sure this film has some mildly funny moments and is often campy, but it's more of a fun, Gothic movie that blends together effectively horror and comedic moments. This movie has impressive visuals and the cinematography is very good as we have come to expect with Tim Burton's films.<br/><br/>Burton's film is about a vampire named Barnabas Collins who escapes his coffin after two-hundred years of imprisonment. He seeks out his relatives and as he plans to cope with living in the year 1972, he also plans to restore his family to their former glory.<br/><br/>This is like the hundredth collaboration between Burton and Johnny Depp, but like always I don't mind. Depp brings a sort of charisma to his role and even though he's a blood-sucking vampire, we still like him. I like how he takes on these interesting roles that we come to know him for. The other actors here such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Chloe Grace Moretz, and Eva Green all do a good job and all seemed to have fun.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a rather fun film to watch that boasts impressive visuals and some cool, Gothic action. It's nice that I cracked up a few times as well. This is not Tim Burton's best, but this is still typical of what we would expect from him. It's not meant to be a serious adaptation, but more of a light-hearted one. For one, I enjoyed this for the most part. I rate this film 8/10."
"angeluck04","8","0","1","29 September 2013"," Not The Typical Vampire Movie
","The Dark Shadows is based around the Collins family. Son Barnabas Collins, played by Johnny Depp, takes head of the family fishing business and becomes quite the successful and charming man. His life seems almost perfect until he denies the love of his maid, Angelique Bouchard,who is played by Eva Green . She ends up becoming enraged by the constant rejection and places a curse on all of those Barnabas loves,resulting in their sudden deaths. She then turns Barnabas into a vampire so that he would have to deal with his loss and suffering for eternity. The town of Collinwood ends up finding out about Barnabas's new secret and locks him in a box in the middle of the forest. Decades later his box is dug up and he is finally set free. The rest of the movie shows his comical struggle to adjust to daily life, learn to coexist with his new family, win back his once successful business, and deal with Angelique. I find that the Dark Shadows is worth watching because it puts a humorously cynical twist on the typical vampire movie.<br/><br/>The first humorously cynical twist was when Barnabas was walking around his lovely old home. His niece thought he was so strange that she asked him if he were stoned. He replied ""They tried stoning me, my dear. It did not work."" It was funny because he was referring to the townspeople attempting to get rid of him, while his niece was talking about being under the influence. Her reaction was priceless because she had no idea what he was speaking about. <br/><br/>The time difference in this movie adds to the cynical humor. Such as the scene when Barnabas referred to his young niece as a woman of the night. You would assume his niece resembled such a woman but it wasn't so. His niece was just dressed as like a typical teenager would in the 70's but that simply threw him off. I found that since she resembled a common girl this joke was even more hysterical because that would have been highly inappropriate in 1752 yet completely fine in the present day. This part of the movie also shows the enormous time difference in the plot and the fact that Barnabas will encounter many things he isn't used to seeing.<br/><br/>Even the devouring of hippies and spiritualists added to the humorously cynical plot. He wanted a better feel for how the people behaved in the 70's. This regime was full of nothing but doped up teenagers and spiritualists. They all sat in a circle around a fire and shared stories and songs. ""I am reminded of a line from Erich Segal's 'Love Story': ""Love means never having to say you're sorry."" However, it is with sincere regret that I must now kill all of you."" Barnabas kills the ambiance of love and peace with in seconds and the doped up teenagers scream in terror. Mean while the audience sees the outlines of the teenagers trying to get away. Of course their lives end just as quickly as the ambiance that was shared. <br/><br/>There is no denying that the Dark Shadows is a humorously cynical work of art. The comical quotes and inappropriate humor is what makes this movie so different from other typical vampire movies. The selection of this cast was perfected to a tee since all the actors and actresses seemed like they were made to play these parts. The plot contains a variety of genres including action,love,humor, and even drama. It is also a movie that really sticks with an audience. The film contains such insane and witty scenes that you can't help but remember even the slightest details. You would also never hear the referencing of a women of the night and a normal girl in ""Twilight."" It will make you drop your mouth and laugh in astonishment from the beginning to the end and I highly recommend it as a one to watch type of film."

","Sit back, relax and enjoy is what I say. Too many people have dissected this film and compared it to the series. Now I know diddly squat about the books or the series so just watched it. Tim Burton puts his own unique stamp on things so visually it is stunning with excellent use of light creating a mood and atmosphere. The film moves along at a nice pace with excellent performances from, Green, Depp and Pfeiffer who keep the dry sense of humour coming thick and fast. The storyline is slick and doesn't hang around so this makes for an enjoyable 2 hours. A lot of people have crabbed this film but just take it for what it is and enjoy it. 10 out of 10 for me."
"havenisle","7","0","1","21 May 2013"," Close, but not quite awesome.
","After my second viewing of this movie, I would have to say that my first opinion remains.<br/><br/>I'll begin by saying that I enjoyed the movie, and will probably buy it on DVD or BluRay. I was fortunate enough to catch it on cable, but I look forward to whatever commentaries or extras that may be available.<br/><br/>That is not to say there were not some gaping flaws in the movie, but perhaps, ten years from now, I may be able to overlook them. I will begin with what was horrible first.<br/><br/>1. Overuse of pop music. I loved the Nights in White Satin, and Barnabas' quoting of Steve Miller, but I feel that Burton had a hard time deciding what songs not to use. Had it been used sparingly, the music would have had a greater impact. I won't choose what songs should have been kept, other than Nights in White Satin. That song fit the scene perfectly, and definitely set the mood for Victoria's character. Also, Alice was great, especially that second song...<br/><br/>2. The naughty romp. As the kids these days say, it was ""OTT."" It would have been better to let the camera move back through a window and let the shadows feed our imagination. I'm no prude, but the sequence was just silly. Also, Dr. Julia's oral examination wasn't needed, either.<br/><br/>3. Woof. Aside from the fact that Carolyn's transformation was skipped, and her foreshadowing was woefully inadequate, (Scooby Doo was great, though...) it was painful to have Angelique explain it in the middle of a battle. The greatest travesty here, of course, was the overwhelmingly unnecessary line, ""Woof."" <br/><br/>4. Victoria? Josette! If this were to work better, I would have had Victoria be less haunted by a specter and more possessed by an old soul. It makes Victoria's life worthless if you don't at least add a simple line like, ""Sometimes I feel as if I've lived two lives...""<br/><br/>5. Barnabas' redemption. I don't feel like he deserved to ""win."" I think a more fitting ending would have been for him to be upset that he had turned Victoria into a vampire. After all, whilst pursuing her, he slept with Angelique and had orals from Dr Julia and there was literally no emotional toll for this. He never cracked, never really flew off the handle and displayed any sort of remorse for his actions. Yes, we know he's a monster, but getting Josette back was an unearned reward for his behavior.<br/><br/>Now, here's what I loved.<br/><br/>1. The fishing side story. I wish there had been more scenes of Christopher Lee, but I was glad for what was there. It was a pleasantly unexpected development, and I think it truly added to the charm of the film.<br/><br/>2. The art. I thought everything from the sets to the costumes to the cars was spot-on. I would have made a point to show off the grounds a bit more, though.<br/><br/>3. David's dad. What a scumbag he was! When Barnabas sent him packing, I was nodding to myself. Sure he could have been eaten, but that's to be expected. Nice to see this trope turned on it's head.<br/><br/>4. David's mum. Not the best delivery, but definitely hits the ""monster mash"" button that Caroline started to push. When that happened, I was like, hell yeah, now lets get some zombies or some animated scarecrows or a mummy from a crypt under the house or something! The house coming to life was okay, but we saw that in that Owen Wilson movie where he gets killed by a fireplace.<br/><br/>5. The ladies. Oh the ladies. Bella Heathcote is the hottest thing on two legs, and the prim governess routine was undoubtedly the hook that kept me watching. I didn't really care for her vampiric makeover, but then again, it didn't look so hot on Johnny Depp, either. It worked for the story, but I felt it was too Nosferatu... (still, it was a very nostalgic shot for fans of the black and white classics- did they grease the lens for that shot?) Sorry Tim Burton, dead things aren't as sexy as you or the Insane Clown Posse would have us believe. Not saying I wouldn't go there if I myself was a vampire, but while I draw breath, I'll take the governess costume all day.<br/><br/>The camera-work was almost perfect. Here's my favorite shots...<br/><br/>1. Victoria on the train. <br/><br/>2. Caroline dancing with the record player. <br/><br/>3. Barnabas posing in front of his painting. <br/><br/>4. Help me!<br/><br/>5. Barnabas on the stairs, eyeballing the lava lamp. <br/><br/>6. Maggie in the psyche ward, looking up at the camera before she escapes. <br/><br/>7. Angelique approaching the manor with her awesome car behind her. <br/><br/>8. Barnabas passing the goods to a doomed hippie. Poor kids, I like em. <br/><br/>9. Barnabas on the dock with his umbrella, looking a bit like some sort of creepy SS Doctor from every Nazi movie ever. <br/><br/>So there you go. It was by no means horrible, but at the same note, it was rather self-indulgent. Perhaps Burton will do better on the next outing. Hint: more Bella and Chloe!"

","When I was much younger I faithfully read every Stephen King novel that came along. And then, along came ""Lisey's Story"" and ""Duma Key"", and suddenly was fed up with Stephen King, and haven't read him since. I'm a little afraid that I'm heading in that same direction, after thinking for several years that Johnny Depp was the best of the younger actors. And the reason is that I'm getting a little tired of Depp thinking that practically every film has to be tongue in cheek. It's been a long time since I've seen him do much serious acting...something he ought to try at least occasionally.<br/><br/>My other complaint here is that when anyone remakes a film (or in this case a television series into a film), the intent of the original ought to remain intact. And again, turning this into a tongue-in-cheek near-comedy (which is not what the television series was) is rather annoying. If you want to make a comedy-horror film, be original about it.<br/><br/>I found this horror film (if that's what it is) boring...and I like good horror films! About the only thing positive I can think of to say about the film is that it has a good soundtrack.<br/><br/>A let down from Depp and a let down from director Tim Burton."

","One of the reasons that ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" are perfect horror comedies is because they each have a consistent tone. ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" plays as both a standard Abbott & Costello comedy and a standard Universal horror film. Bud & Lou play for laughs and the monsters play it straight. The only exception is when Frankenstein's Monster recoils in horror when seeing Costello for the first time. ""Young Frankenstein"" examines all the clichés of old ""Frankenstein"" movies, but the characters are always deadly serious.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've been listening to a lot of old time radio comedy shows featuring horror stars like Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre. Some are really good (""Bob Hope"", ""Abbott & Costello""), but most of them (""Dinah Shore"", ""Command Performance"") are painful, because they are written by hacks with no love for the genre, who trot out the same references and puns every time. They'd be unbearable if it wasn't for the gravitas brought by the stars – Peter Lorre, in particular, could make any line funny.<br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" plays as if a team of writers from the ""Dinah Shore Show"" were assigned to write a straight horror movie and couldn't resist the impulse to Get a Few Boffos! This could have been *such* a good movie, and it's just crap. It just has no idea what kind of film it wants to be, and the mix it tries for just doesn't mix. Barnabas Collins emerges from his coffin after 196 years and he's *really thirsty*, killing eleven construction workers luckless enough to have dug up his grave. Then he does a lame gag with a McDonald's sign. He brushes his teeth while looking into a mirror which doesn't reflect him. He sleeps hanging upside down like a bat.<br/><br/>There are some chilling moments, as when Barnabas sadly announces to a group of hippies with whom he has been pleasantly (if inanely) conversing, that he will now have to kill all of them. Which he does. It wants to be a straight horror film. It wants to be a fish-out-of-water comedy. And it has NO clue how to put the two together.<br/><br/>Burton also steals the brilliant sex-so-hot-it-trashes-the-bedroom scene from ""The Tall Guy"", where Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson hilariously wrecked an entire room – without the benefit of harnesses and stunt people. It's not funny here.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does what he can with the material. For this picture, rather than channeling Michael Jackson, he's 100% doing Richard Burton as a vampire.<br/><br/>Eva Green is really good as Angelique, though unlike Lara Parker, her eyes are not her most prominent features.<br/><br/>Jackie Earle Haley is good as Willie Loomis, totally played for laughs rather than as John Karlen's angsty, guilt-ridden dweeb.<br/><br/>I love Helena Bonham Carter in most things, and here she's a redhead, so you're not going to catch me saying she's being anything less than magnificent. I started to visualize Grayson Hall (the original Dr. Hoffman) going as far with Jonathan Frid as Bonham Carter goes with Depp, but my inner eyeballs started burning.<br/><br/>Everybody else was OK. Eh.<br/><br/>Original series stars Jonathan Frid, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker and David Selby appear in the ball sequence – for four seconds.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the original series. I had high hopes because Tim Burton and Johnny Depp kept loudly proclaiming that THEY were fans of the original series. As a straight vampire film with great characters and solid acting, this is a bust. As an episode of ""The Birds-Eye Open House with Dinah Shore"", it's serviceable. Not a bomb, but incredibly disappointing and not worth seeing."

","This movie is for those 13 and older. This Dark Shadows shares little with the Dark Shadows of the late 1960s/early 1970s except for the names of the characters. Yes, Barnabas is still a vampire and Angelique a witch. With its overly dramatic acting and dark picturesque scenes, this movie comes off more like a comic book. Not the say the interpretation is bad, it is just very different (no werewolf in the original Dark Shadows in the original family). The interpretation is so different that many who grew up with Jonathan Frid as Barnabas may feel a bit cheated. Jonathan Frid's character tried to hide his monster from his family, this Barnabas does not hide his monster. Who cares if the characters are shallow or that the script is not that good. It is a comic book rendition of Dark Shadows.For what it is, it works. This is a popcorn popper and a cruncher at the end. You gotta love the sets and the addition of Alice Cooper.

","This rendition of Dark Shadows plays out like a joke to the audience of the original soap. What this movie does is retain the characters and the relationships, but almost entirely discards everything else that made the soap what it was.<br/><br/>The 2012 film is a what-if scenario. What if the Gothic horror/drama was turned into a Tim Burton comedy? And what if they set it in the 70s instead of the 60s for some reason? What if ALL the story lines we know and loved were completed neglected on all accounts?<br/><br/>What if Roger didn't have his proper accent? What if Willie was a balding drunk? What if Dr. Hoffman was a drunk too? What if Maggie Evans was merged into Victoria Winters and had a convoluted backstory? What if one of the characters was a werewolf for absolutely no reason? What if Alice Cooper partied at Collinwood? What if Burke Devlin never existed?! Nor Jason McGuire, Reverend Trask, Ben Stokes, Jeremiah Collins, and countless others... What if nothing followed a pattern, and we just get vague cutouts of our beloved characters?<br/><br/>With its innumerous differences to the show accounted for, how *is* this movie actually? It's surprisingly watchable, in an over-bloated Tim Burton kind of way, but this movie really shines its subtle moments, which was a highlight aspect of the show. In a film where almost everything is just wrong about the mythology, Johnny Depp plays Barnabas Collins (vampire), channeling the original actor Jonathan Frid in a commendable performance where he retains the propriety of the real Barnabas. At least it kept that right, but all-in-all, this is a terrible representation of what Dark Shadows is all about. This movie is more amusing in how extravagant it is with the liberties it takes."

","Dark Shadows is a tale spun from the 1966-1971 TV series with the same name. The filmmakers chose a comedic twist to deliver in 113 minutes what was once a 1,225 episode, daytime, Gothic horror soap opera.<br/><br/>Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) loses the love of his life, is cursed with eternal vampirism by the jealous witch, Angelique (Eva Green), and buried alive in 1752 Collinsport Maine. 200 years later in 1972, he is dug up during the construction of a McDonald's restaurant. He returns to Collinsport and finds his beloved Collinwood Mansion has fallen into ruin along with Collins Cannery, the source of his family's wealth. The present-day and still cursed Collins family is under the protective watch of descendant, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer). Her orphaned nephew sees dead people and her daughter deals with hairy teenage-hood. Barnabas amusingly blends in and takes them under his vampiric wing. His mission: to restore the respectable Collins name. Yes, he's a vampire! His ambitions are quickly buried again by Angelique when he falls in love, again, with the destined Josette, a.k.a. Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp fans, this is a must-see. The film is gorgeously shot and uses all of Depp's talents to build to a climax that brings all the sub- plots home. Unfortunately, only three characters are necessary in the telling and the ending falls flat on its face in a classic case of deus ex machina. Maybe the filmmakers will give us an eternal, happily-ever- after ending to make up for it?"

","Fans of the original TV series are mixed on this modern telling of the story. This is a review of the film on its own with a nod, not a true remake, of the cult show that has a fervent following.<br/><br/>There is, as in most Tim Burton films, a mix of wonderful images and creative characterizations along with some incoherent inconsistencies of plot. The look of the film is pop culture Goth and is appealing with appalling sort of violent visuals that releases some bloody bits along with dark humor. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp's eloquent performance carries the film from its frustrating narrative and the displaced character's confrontation with modern culture delivers the most fun. Most of the other players seem to be there for support rather than substance and the film does suffer a bit from this shallow scenario.<br/><br/>In the end it is a movie that is part premiere Burton and part filler with some inclusions that are flat and less than farcical. The Alice Cooper bits for one, and lack of substantive script support from the family and friends that really don't have much to do in the Collins mansion. Taken as a whole it is less satisfying, but some of the artistic renderings and ghoulish gimmicks are worth the trip back to a time when a midday soap could capture the imagination of a generation with a completely original counter (culture) program."

Collins seduces one of the housemaids, who loves him very dearly, but finds out that the Barnabas does not love him back. Barnabas falls in love and marries to which the house maid feels heartbroken and jealous to and places a cruse on Collins family who die under mysterious circumstances and ends up wiping out most of Barnabas ancestors, but most of all places a curse on Barnabas himself, who himself jumps off the cliff in order to be with his dead wife who not a few moments ago jumped off the cliff under the spell of the house maid, the witch Angelique Bouchard, Barnabas finds himself surviving the fall only to find out that he's been turned into a Vampire by the witch. Towns people are turned against Barnabas as he kills people for blood, they arrest him, chain him and then bury him inside the coffin....Alive.<br/><br/>200 years later or should I say 196 (As said by the antagonist of the movie) the coffin is opened and the things are about to change for the better ...or the worse.<br/><br/>The story is rather very simple and not that complicated to understand. It gives you a sense on what to expect at the very start of the movie. Dark Shadows falls under the category of Dark Horror Comedy, Tim Burton (the director of the movie who needs no introduction) directs that movie quite well. He's no stranger to dark tone of the movies, his shining example would be ""Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street"" that was released in 2007. Johnny Depp once again returns along Tim Burtons side, to me personally this actor can portray many roles with ease, he can be a Demon Barber, Captain Jack Sparrow, Mad Hatter ........a Vampire and countless other roles he was played over the years. In short he was perfect for that role.<br/><br/>This movie is well directed, the sets are amazing, the performances are top notch. The visuals look amazing, despite of having everything perfect, I think the script needed a bit more work on it to make it more memorable and developing other characters more. Despite that minor shortcoming aside, I certainly enjoyed watching the movie ""Dark Shadows"". I won't be seeing it again & again,. But it's a pretty pleasant ride that should be experienced at least ""once""."

","Alright, I went into this movie with very low expectations after being appalled by the first trailer and reading some dismal reviews of the movie beforehand. --Note this review contains spoilers-- Now to be fair, I had not become a fan of the original Dark Shadows soap opera until two months before the movie came out. I had been trying for years to track down a copy and thanks to the recent DVD re-releases in anticipation for the new movie; I was able to watch it. Despite the numerous onset gaffes, I loved it and was drawn in by the characters as well as the very compelling storyline. Now watching Tim Burton's adaptation, I tried my best to watch it as its own film. However, once the movie started, it turned out that I couldn't even do that. Dark Shadows opens in the year 1760 with the Collins family arriving in Maine from Liverpool and establishing the fishing town of Collinsport. Years later, Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is seen having an affair with the family maid Angelique (Eva Green). However, he soon tosses her aside in favor of marrying Josette DuPres (Bella Heathcote). However, it turns out that Angelique is witch who in turn kills Barnabas' parents, puts a spell on Josette which leads to her jumping off the cliff known as Widow's Hill and Barnabas is turned into a vampire. He is then locked up in a coffin and buried alive by the townspeople. Cut to the year 1972, a young girl named Maggie Evans (Bella Heathcote once again) has just escaped from Windcliff Sanitarium and hops on a train to works as a governess at the house Collinwood under the pseudonym of Victoria Winters. There she meets the reclusive family matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stodard (Michelle Pfeiffer), her rebellious daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), her brother Roger Collins (Johnny Miller), Roger's antisocial son David (Gulliver McGrath), an alcoholic live-in psychiatrist Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) and the family caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley). It isn't long after these characters are introduced that a construction crew accidentally opens the coffin of Barnabas Collins who dispatches them for blood. Barnabas finds that the Collins family fishing business is in financial ruins after their competitor Angel (Angelique in disguise) has pretty much taken over the fishing industry in Collinsport. With no other options, he decides to help his descendants regain their former glory and take back the fishing industry. Furious, Angelique is now hell bent on destroying the Collins family and at the same time trying to win Barnabas back. Again, while trying to look at this as a movie and not a Dark Shadows, I still couldn't help making the comparisons. Johnny Depp has none of the charm of Jonathan Frid as Barnabas Collins and spends the entire movie being shocked by everything he sees from a TV set to a lava lamp (this is gag is played through out the whole movie). Unlike the late Mr. Frid, Depp makes no attempt to blend in to his surroundings and seem like he is belong there which is not only an insult to the character but highly unrealistic. Sure the original Barnabas slipped up occasionally and almost threatened his own existence, but that's what his character more interesting and real. Eva Green as Angelique is actually pretty good and has all the jealousy of Lara Parker's performance but lacks Parker's hypnotic stare (Green can't help that though). Michelle Pfeiffer also does a fine job as Elizabeth Stoddard and captures the spirit of Joan Bennett in my opinion. However, I hated Helena Bonham Carter as Julia Hoffman. There way her character is written is as a drunk and a very vain woman. She offers to cure Barnabas of his vampirism, but is really stealing his blood so she can become a vampire to stay young. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard! First off, making her a drunk is a huge insult to her character (Grayson Hall was never an alcoholic), makes her seem less professional and more incompetent. Also, the idea that Hoffman was stealing Barnabas blood is vast departure from the original series when she actually curing him. At that point, when she was sucked dry of her blood by Barnabas, I didn't make much of a difference to me. The rest of cast is very disposable. Heathcote is very bland as Vicky Winters/Maggie Evans, Johnny Miller was such a dick as Roger Collins (a complete detour from the original character), Chloe Grace Moretz is okay as Carolyn Stoddard (did they really need to sexualize her?) and Gulliver McGrath was given very little screen time as David (though David Collins was very annoying in the original series). The rest of the movie is pretty much full of nitpicks and controversial moments. These include the implied oral sex scene between Barnabas & Julia as well as Carolyn being revealed to be a werewolf at the very end of the film! The movie tries to cram all five years and 1225 episodes of Dark Shadows into a two hour movie. It changes certain ideas and combines others. At the same time Dark Shadows also has no idea whether it wants to be a comedy or a horror movie. There are some comedic scenes early that suddenly shift to Barnabas killing a group of hippies for their blood. There's even an argument between Barnabas and Angelique which leads to one of the dumbest sex scenes in a movie ever! However, the movie does have some merits which include great cinematography, vivid set design, and a fairly decent musical score by Danny Elfman. However, the most of the song selections (Nights in White Satin, Get it on, etc.) are shoehorned in to remind the audience that it's the seventies. Also, the movie lacks the Robert Cobert theme from the show! Bottom line, this movie is just okay. Not terrible, but certainly a misfire as a DS movie."

","Prior to the release of Tim Burton's highly-anticipated, big screen adaptation of TV's Dark Shadows, I admit I never come across this popular cult series before. But this four decades-old classic Gothic soap opera proves to be personal favorites for both Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer when they were young. And it's no doubt that Tim Burton is a natural choice to direct DARK SHADOWS. After all, (nobody) does quirky Gothic elements better than Burton himself. Too bad his eighth collaboration with Johnny Depp proves to be another creative misfire since their last outing in 2010's ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Not only that, DARK SHADOWS is also their worst collaboration to date. It's really hard to believe, especially given the source material that they suppose to pull it off with relative ease.

"jdkraus","6","0","2","2 June 2012"," Dark Shadows feels like a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp flick, yet it does not deliver as one
","I have not seen the TV series ""Dark Shadows"" so I cannot make a comparison. What I can say is that this film is very Tim Burton-esque. It is filled with pitch-black nights, fog, haunting scenarios, ghosts, witches, magic, Gothic architecture, a hint of wicked humor, and oddball characters. By the previews, this movie could go no wrong for Burton and Depp have made some very wonderful movies together: Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd, Sleepy Hollow, and Edward Scissorshands to name few. <br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" plot is very simple. In the late 18th century, Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is cursed to an immortal life as a vampire by the witch Angelique (Eva Green) over a case of jealous love. He reawakens in 1972 to find his manor in near ruins as well as his thoroughly dysfunctional, distant family facing bankruptcy. With the help of his very odd and indifferent family, he tries to rebuild his family's name and seek vengeance against Angelique. <br/><br/>The performances are great all around in this movie. Each character is given enough screen time to develop both a personality and a desire to be either liked or despised by the audience. Eva Green poses as the great, seductive villainous Angelique that can be hated yet adored by her stunning looks. Chloe Moritz once again plays the bad girl, as the rebellious teen Carolyn. Johnny Lee Miller passes off as the dimwitted dad who is out for himself. Gulliver McGrath plays the creepy little boy David that is only a couple of notches shy of Damien from The Omen. Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley pass off as the wacky drunks Dr. Koffman and Willie that supply some comic relief. The only character that seems to have any sanity in this movie is Elizabeth Collins, portrayed wonderfully by Michelle Pfeifer. Then of course there is Barnabas Collins. Depp does not play Barnabas as over the top as I had seen him as Ed Wood or Sweeney Todd. Instead, he is very subtle in his performance. His mannerisms and fluent delivery of lines gives the feeling that his character is a misunderstood and misplaced outcast, like his work as Edward Scissorhands. He does have his intense moments though.<br/><br/>In addition to a solid cast, the sets, costumes, make-up, and SFX make Dark Shadows look like a very nice film. Though ""Dark Shadows"" has the cast and production value, it is not that great of a movie. Most of this is because Dark Shadows tries to be funny and scary at the same time. Sure, there are some funny moments, but none of it had me rolling with laugher. Unfortunately, a bit of the humor is on the risqué side, which I did not desire or expect in this film. In regards to horror, the elements are there: ghosts, curses, and witches, but none of it is that frightening. In fact, there are not even any jump moments as a lame effort to be scary. <br/><br/>Adding more fuel to the fire, there are also some story flaws. Bits of dialog are thrown in at the final sequence to sheepishly explain some of the back-story that could have been explored much earlier in the film. The biggest problem I had with this movie was the music. Danny Elfman is a wonderful composer, but his music is almost non-existent in this feature. Instead, old 1970 rock songs like ""Nights in White Satin"" are played throughout the film's pivotal scenes. I understand that this was used as an attempt to create a nostalgic feeling of the 1970s, but it does not work at all for a Tim Burton flick. I want the magic of Danny Elfman—not the Moody Blues. <br/><br/>Dark Shadows is not a terrible movie. It had a lot of potential, specifically with a solid cast and great production values, but it falls flat on everything else. It feels like a Tim Burton movie, but at the same time it does not."
"blogurious","4","0","1","31 May 2012"," Depp can't do miracles.
","That Tim Burton is a source of dumbfounded creativity is no big surprise. His touch and sensibility when dealing with amazing characters translate well to the screen, taking the viewer gently to a world of fantasy and good entertainment. <br/><br/>However, ""Dark Shadows"" - although relying on a talented and capable cast - leaves a lot to be desired. The beginning is quite enthralling, as one of those children's stories that capture our undivided attention, building up the expectations, making me believe I was in for a special treat. Boy, was I mislead. In fact, once you're through the explanation part, everything seems to die every passing minute. The story lingers on, with some passages that are pretentiously too serious for this type of comedy, while others are very silly. The combination, as a result, doesn't work well and the last minutes are noisy and messy. I was very disappointed and, at some moments, quite anxious for the final credits. I love Depp, but not even his presence could stop this boat from sinking deep."
"ChristinaPlasek","7","0","2","22 May 2012"," Depends,
","I have never seen the Dark Shadows TV show & to be honest, didn't even know it existed until this movie! So this is a blank page to me and I actually enjoyed it. (Despite all the bad comments which I found sadly to be true about the movie.) In the beginning, it set itself up to be an interesting & some-what dark movie like the trailers promised. Then, as I later realized after watching, the movie spiraled into a confusing and unexplained plot of events. I mean, you have Barnabus coming home to his distant family, which was weird considering he never had any kids. And how he had made a connection with Victoria Winters and then has sex with his supposed-to-be mortal (or in this case, immortal) enemy seeing she killed 'his true love' and his parents not to mention later revealing she was to blame for other family problems. So that left me asking what anyone's true motives where in this movie.<br/><br/>And some scenes had come to shock me like when the alcoholic 'psychiatrist' as she calls herself has her own affair with Barnabus. I did NOT see that coming but it definitely brings you out of your sleep.<br/><br/>Not to mention the teenage girl just so happens to be a werewolf? I was like REALLY? Especially since she had no effect so it was just pointless.<br/><br/>There were also those parts where I thought made the movie come back a bit like when Barnabus naively tries to understand how to get a girl and fails miserably which I thought was cutely funny.<br/><br/>I genuinely enjoyed myself and yes, I would see it again if someone asked. It may not be a 10 but I don't think it deserves less than a 5."

","""Dark Shadows"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Humor, Some Sexual Innuendo, Violence and Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&53mns.<br/><br/>My Take **1/2 (out of ****) -&/or- The IMDb Scale: 6.4/10 <br/><br/>I never understood the appeal daytime soap operas. Though, I must confess, I've always been curious about ""Dark Shadows,"" the daytime soap that ran from 1967-1971. I've always been aware of it, but never saw it. This show was set in a dark Maine mansion where family patriarch Barnabas Collins was a 200-year-old vampire. Supernatural occurrences were normal for the series. So were supernatural beings like werewolves, witches, warlocks, zombies and ghosts. They sure didn't have those on ""As the World Turns."" <br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" was never a mainstream mainstay, though it did gain a cult-like fan following. Now ""Dark Shadows"" has been re-imagined for a big-screen makeover by director Tim Burton (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Sweeney Todd"") and actor Johnny Depp, who are also fans of the series. Depp even claimed when he was a teenager he wanted to be Barnabas Collins. In Burton's new ""Dark Shadows"" movie, Depp gets to do exactly that.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1760 with the entrepreneurial Collins family leaving Liverpool, England for Maine to further their fishing business empire. The family settles the bustling Collinsport and they build the elaborate family mansion of Collinswood Manor. Growing up in the lap of luxury, Barnabas Collins (Depp, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"") enjoyed his youth as a wealthy playboy destined to take over the family business. That is until he spurned the love of jealous witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green, ""Casino Royale"") for his fiancée Josette DePres (Bella Heathcote, ""In Time""). Angelique uses her dark arts to kill Josette and turn Barnabas into a vampire to mourn Josette for eternity. Framed by the dubious witch, Barnabas is chained and buried alive by the townspeople of Collinsport.<br/><br/>After 200 years of confinement, Barnabas is freed in 1972. His discovery of a certain fast food chain's sign provides one of the biggest laughs in the whole movie. He finds his beloved Collinswood to be a shadow of its former self with only four living Collins residing there. The family is no longer a proud one, but dysfunctional and unhappy. The curse Angelique had put on Barnabas also affected the future generations of the Collins with travesty and despair.<br/><br/>Angelique is still in Collinsport after two centuries. Through her black magic, she has not aged a day. She has made it her life's work to sink the Collins family into financial ruin with her own fishing businesses. Once she discovers Barnabas is back, she resumes her fascination with him and plots to have him at all costs.<br/><br/>As I watched ""Dark Shadows,"" I deeply admired the craft of the movie. Here is a film that doesn't go over the top with CGI to tell its story. CGI is there, but the film relies more on tone, darkness, shadows and the elaborate sets of Collinswood Manor to create a convincing atmosphere for the characters to exist in. I enjoyed the old-fashioned feel to the picture, befitting to the eras we see depicted, which is something many big-budget special effects extravaganzas seem to get wrong.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is fun to watch as Barnabas Collins. I really enjoyed his appropriately stilted performance as a late 1700s British man muddling his way through 1970s American culture. His observations of music icons Karen Carpenter, Alice Cooper and Steve Miller definitely provide nice touches of humor. Barnabas is a fish out of water. His interactions with other characters are high points throughout the film. Kudos is also in order for Eva Green. She's very classy and sassy as Angelique. She's a great foil to the Collins family.<br/><br/>Though ""Dark Shadows"" is replete with vampirism, witchcraft, secret identities, re-incarnation, ghostly apparitions and a brooding mansion with secrets, I couldn't help but feel the movie felt a little flat. You would think the film with all these elements would have enormous entertainment potential. In fact, the whole second act is one big lull. As it stands, ""Dark Shadows"" is like an ice-cold sodapop without the fizz.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Tim Burton really knew where he was going with this movie. Is this film best served as a comedy? Well, maybe if there were more humor to balance out the story and tone. Is it a drama? For a picture inspired by a soap opera, the normal plot-twists and surprises you would expect to see are absent. Is it a horror film? Not really, but it does borrow overtones from the spooky Republic/Hammer films of yesteryear.<br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" is not a bad film by any means. I kind of liked it, but not enough to recommend it (a bare minimum of three stars are required for that). The film suffers from being a ""one-shot."" It has all these really great parts to it, but due to time restraints, nothing is really explored beyond the basics. It is like the filmmakers put everything into this picture because they wanted it to be representative of the television series. The problem there is the TV show had time to go into these different tangents over a course of several episodes. The movie does not have the ability to do that.<br/><br/>""Dark Shadows"" looks good with great looking sets and spot-on acting. The soundtrack is a great montage of rock songs popular in the early seventies. If anything you can at least enjoy the ambiance the visuals, acting and music provide throughout this picture. The picture is only hindered by a sense of aimlessness. So, Mr. Tim Burton, if you're not sure what kind of a film you're trying to make, then your audience might not know what to make of your film either. I'm just sayin'."

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","1","17 May 2012"," A good performance by Johnny Depp is mired in a plot that goes nowhere.
","*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br/><br/>Dark Shadows is a movie that begins with a wonderfully melodramatic fire, but then ultimately sinks under a plot that seems to give up half way through. Like all Tim Burton productions, it looks marvelous, evoking a centuries old family-built seaside village and a mansion that seems to reek of ancient family secrets. Unfortunately, like a lot of Tim Burton's lesser movies its visuals don't match its story in their full-blooded creativity. It leaves a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The set-up is well-founded. We learn that the fishing village of Collinsport was the legacy of the Collins family, who sailed to America in the 18th century and settled in Maine in order to start a new life. On board was young Barnabus Collins (Johnny Depp), who grew to be a strapping young lad who was expected to carry on the family tradition. In a series of beautifully-made opening scenes, we see the construction of the town, and the construction of Collinwood, the family manor. Barnabus, we learn, was in love with the beautiful Josette (Bella Heathcote), whom he intended to marry. Unfortunately that did not sit well with Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), the house maid who wanted Barnabus for her very own. He spurned her, but was unaware that she was secretly a witch. Under her influence Josette threw herself off a cliff and cursed Barnabus to be a vampire, chained-up and buried alive in a coffin forever.<br/><br/>Barnabus is unearthed 190 years later in 1972, unaware and confused by the changes that have taken place over two centuries. Almost immediately he sets about to return to Collinwood and finds that his descendants haven't exactly kept up the family name. The manor is run down, the family business is on life support and everyone at Collinwood seems as if they could care less. Occupying the house are Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, the family matriarch (Michelle Pfeiffer); Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller) her worthless thieving brother; Willy Loomis (Jackie Earle Hayley) the caretaker; Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace-Moretz), Elizabeth's spaced-out teenage daughter; Ten year-old David Collins (Gulliver McGrath); Also about is Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham-Carter), the family psychiatrist who lives in a state of drunkenness when she isn't fighting off a hang-over.<br/><br/>Also in the house is the new governess, a woman with a mysterious past who calls herself Victoria Winter, and to Barnabus' delight, looks exactly like his lovely Josette. She has a dark history that is sad, but never really seems relevant to the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>Barnabus quickly comes to understand that the family, and its fortunes, have fall into disrepair. The fishing village that he helped to build is now in the hands of a woman who has been single-handedly responsible for nearly running the family right out of business. Barnabus is not surprised to find the culprit is the witch Angelique, who has lived on these 200 years, and still seeks revenge, not just on him but on his family name.<br/><br/>The plot involving Angelique is canned and tiresome, leading to The Big Showdown with lots of fires and explosions and magic powers. The best parts of Dark Shadows are the moments of shock and awe that 1972 has on Barnabus' old world style. He's perplexed by television (particularly The Carpenters), by automobiles, and by rock music – particularly Alice Cooper whom he decries as ""The ugliest woman I have ever seen!"" At one point he is particularly fixated on Carolyn's lava lamp, regarding it: ""It looks like a pulsating beacon of blood and urine!"" I never thought about it, but he's right.<br/><br/>If the movie achieves nothing else, then it is an example of why Johnny Depp is one of our best and most charismatic actors. He is a good looking actor who could have used those looks as a ticket to easy paychecks in action pictures and romantic comedies. Yet, he is smarter than that, choosing projects that allow him to try on different hats, accents, outfits and personalities. His gallery of characters all possesses a certain inviting flare. There's nothing dull or boring about them. He has the ability to raise even the most mundane material out of the doldrums. Here, he plays Barnabus Collins as a man who really does seem to have come from the 18th century. He is erudite, formal and has a mind still steeped in the social tradition of a bygone age.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is a performance at the service of a plot that ultimately goes nowhere. The movie was written by a new screenwriter named Seth Grahame-Smith, whose very short list of credits includes Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter due out later this summer. Based on this film and the promise of that film, he's doesn't seem to be aiming to be the next Norman Mailer. His script is unfocused, keeping Barbabus dead-center while the other characters remain unfocused and half-written. There are ideas here that seem to promise great things but then don't go anywhere. The movie is so overwhelmed by style that it can't find a narrative drive. This is one half of a good movie – the good half being Depp's performance, while the other half never quite gets off the ground."

","OK way to kill a couple of hours, but this movie is very boring. It's like they had a check list of the TV show and just ran down the list checking things off to throw into the movie. Johnny Depp's make-up frequently changes mid scene. Sometimes his lips are white and then they will be red (and not just after kissing Angelique). The love story between Barnabas and Josette is terrible and literally thrown in at the last minute. He has affairs with the Doctor and Angelique tho. I think they should have kept the quirkiness, but left out the comedy. If doesn't fit well with this type of movie. How can Elizabeth not know her daughter Carolyn is a werewolf? I didn't like Roger being a thief either. Plus Barnabas goes out in the daylight. I doubt having an umbrella makes that much of a difference."

My 12 year-old-brother whispered to me, about 30minutes in the rest of the plot.

"gstepup","7","0","2","16 May 2012"," Limpid energy sustained only by Depp and three beautiful costars
","DARK SHADOWS was created for TV by Dan Curtis, which aired from 1966- 1971. The new film is reverentially written by John August and Seth Grahame-Smith. Johnny Depp topbills, with Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, Helena Bonham Carter and Chloë Grace Moretz. ""An imprisoned vampire, Barnabas Collins (Depp), is set free and returns to his ancestral home, where his dysfunctional descendants are in need of his protection."" (imdb.com). Depp adds another rich character to his cornucopia of inimitable delineations, with much pizzaz and gloss, as a man-about-town in 1752 Collinsport, Maine, who is turned into a vampire and buried alive. Eva Green is (initially) exquisite as the witch, Angeline, who curses him after he spurns her affections, and Pfeiffer and Bonham Carter are topnotch as Depp's circa-1972 descendants, living in Collinwood Manor. Tim Burton's stories and movies have always bordered on the macabre, but DARK SHADOWS, despite the invigorating performances from the cast, is never as horribly menacing as his SWEENEY TODD (2007) or CORPSE BRIDE (2005), although beautifully layered like BIG FISH (2003), CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) and ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010). Even replicating the poignancy of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990) or the frenetic pace of MARS ATTACKS! (1996) would have been welcome pluses. Thankfully, Depp is an actor with a Michael Caine/Christopher Lee penchant for an eclectic filmography, and his Barnabas Collins rises from the limpid energy sustained feebly by the film. Christopher Lee, famous for horror films from 1950s-1980s, is wasted in a brief role; a pity, he could have energized what scenes he had. Even Eva Green, my new favorite actress from CASINO ROYALE, appears to channel Elvira, Mistress of the Dark (actress Cassandra Peterson). This film has all the components of a successful horror picture but modern-day audiences may find it hard to relate to the 1970s-set dialogue, much as the flamboyant costumes, wigs and sets (by Rick Heinrichs) add sparkle to Burton's otherwise aimless remake of the popular 1960s TV show. Kudos also to Danny Elfman, who always provides thrilling music for Burton's ouvres. However, DARK SHADOWS is a must for Depp completists and fans of Green, Pfeiffer of Bonham Carter."

I was expecting something much funnier and unique, but, as others have noted, ALL of the funny scenes were shown in the ads for the film, and the plot was one we've seen a zillion times. The film wasn't particularly scary, funny, or dramatic, so I'm not sure what it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>I don't want to include any spoilers here, so am trying to not divulge much, but some of the scenes and characterizations make little sense, and, unless I missed it, the relationship of those living in the mansion to Barnabas' family is never explained. We're just left to assume they are somewhere in the Collins line.<br/><br/>Some of the special effects are cool, but I wish they had at least shown a little more gore since there was nothing else very interesting about the film.

","When it comes to movies, I only expect to be entertained and nothing else. If it makes me think deeply about any given subject, all the better but if I'm not drawn in I don't care. Therefore, my tastes with film are simple...if I came out of the theater feeling like it was money and time well spent, then it was a decent film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie and was thoroughly entertained. I grew up on old Dark Shadows reruns, and enjoyed that Burton didn't take it too seriously (as I think the early 90's revival series with Ben Cross did). Let's face it...the original series was cheesy, and oftentimes downright bad. But the story lines were compelling, and Jonathan Frid was a pretty good actor to boot.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes of the film were brilliant. The opening scenes portrayed how the Collins family arrived in Colonial America, the affair with Angelique, the death of Josette and the transformation of Barnabas. It then goes into the opening credits with Knights In White Satin as the background music while Victoria Winters travels to Colinsport through the forests of Maine.<br/><br/>From there the 1970's story takes off and the comedy begins. Most of the comedy centered around Barnabas being a fish out of water in the 1970's. Now, I admit that while watching the series as a kid, I always thought Barnabas eased his way into modern times with too little difficulty. Shouldn't Barnabas have been confounded by say, electricity, cars, or pop culture? It seems that Burton and Depp thought that as well and there were several very funny scenes showing how Barnabas coped with the modern world. I laughed out loud several times along with the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>So finally, we come to the climax, and that was where I felt the movie went off the tracks. Without giving spoilers away, there was a major surprise during the climax that made me go ""where did that come from?"" But generally, the climactic scene was a bit boring for such a major scene!<br/><br/>As for other issues, I feel the one other problem was that the character of Dr. Julia Hoffman was unnecessary in this film. In the original series, she had quite a major role. Burton cut out quite few major characters in this film from the original series, so I ended up feeling he was trying to find a role for his wife in the movie more than keeping the character in out of necessity for the plot line. To have given the plot line with Dr. Julia it's proper due you really would have needed several more scenes.<br/><br/>Based on how much I was entertained by the film, I give it an 8. I would have probably gave it a 9 had the climax been different and keeping more with the story line. For the first 15 minutes of the film alone, I bumped up the score from 7 to 8 as rarely are opening credits done so well as in this film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to fans of the original series who never took it too seriously, or anyone who loves a good send-up to Twilight (one MAJOR scene in particular) and loves 70's nostalgia."
