"ahammel-1","10","730","784","28 May 2006"," A stunning directorial debut which deserves to be seen everywhere
","Because this movie deals with recent German history, some German comments about it get sidetracked into minute historical discussions. Forget them; Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie that should be seen everywhere.<br/><br/>The former East Germany, a relatively small country of 16 million people, was controlled by the most sophisticated, cunning, and thorough secret police the world has ever seen, the East German Ministerium für Staatsicherheit, or ""Stasi."" The Stasi had about 90,000 employees -- a staggering number for such a small population -- but even more importantly, recruited a network of hundreds of thousands of ""unofficial employees,"" who submitted secret reports on their co-workers, bosses, friends, neighbors, and even family members. Some did so voluntarily, but many were bribed or blackmailed into collaboration.<br/><br/>Das Leben der Anderen, (""The Life of Others"") German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut, builds this painful legacy into a fascinating, moving film. In its moral seriousness, artistic refinement, and depth, Das Leben der Anderen simply towers over other recent German movies, and urgently deserves a wide international release. The fulcrum of the movie (but probably not its most important character) is Georg Dreyman, an up-and-coming East German playwright in his late 30s. Played by the square-jawed Sebastian Koch, Dreyman is an (apparently) convinced socialist who's made his peace with the regime. His plays are either ideologically neutral or acceptable, and he's even received State honors.<br/><br/>Although he is a collaborator, he is also a Mensch. He uses his ideological ""cleanliness"" to intervene on behalf of dissidents such as his journalist friend Paul Hauser (Hans-Uwe Bauer). These unfortunates must contend with every humiliation a totalitarian state can invent: their apartments are bugged, friends and family are recruited to inform on them, and chances to publish or perform can be extinguished by one stray comment from a Central Committee member. The most recalcitrant can be kicked out of the country and stripped of their citizenship, like the singer songwriter Wolf Biermann.<br/><br/>Dreyman lives in a shabby-genteel, book-filled apartment with his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a renowned actress who often appears in his plays. At the beginning of the movie, Dreyman himself comes under the regime's suspicion, for reasons that become clear only later. The fearful machinery of the Stasi rumbles to life: his movements are recorded, and his apartment bugged. The Stasi had bugging down to a science: a team of meticulously-trained agents swoop into your apartment when you're not there, install miniscule, undetectable listening devices in every single room -- including the bathroom -- and vanish in less than an hour, leaving no trace. Agents set up an secret electronic command post nearby, keeping a written record of every joke, argument, or lovemaking session.<br/><br/>The ""operative process"" against Dreyman is overseen by Stasi captain Gerd Wiesler, played by Ulrich Mühe, an actor from the former East who was himself once in the Stasi's cross-hairs. Captain Wiesler starts the film as a colorless, icy, tight-lipped professional who shows no mercy in fighting the ""enemies of socialism"": if he needs to interrogate a suspect for 10 hours without sleep to get a confession, he will do so -- and then place the seat-cover the suspect sat on in a vacuum jar in case the miscreant should later need to be tracked by bloodhounds. At night, Captain Wiesler returns to his tiny apartment in an grubby, anonymous high-rise. He settles himself among his inexpressibly drab furniture, eats a meal squeezed out of a plastic tube while watching reports about agricultural production, and then goes to bed alone.<br/><br/>As Captain Wiesler listens to Dreyman and his girlfriend he begins to like them, or perhaps envy the richness and depth of their lives in comparison with his own. Perhaps he also begins to wonder why a stranger should have the right to become privy to Dreyman's most intimate secrets: his occasional impotence, his girlfriend's infidelities, his artistic crises. At the same time, though, Wiesler is under pressure: a Central Committee official has made it clear to Wiesler and his toadying supervisor Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), that Dreyman has to go down. <br/><br/>I won't discuss more plot details, as there are unexpected twists. Each of the main characters is drawn deeper into the conflict between Dreyman and the State, and each is torqued by loyalty conflicts that intensify as the pressure increases. The cast is outstanding. Sebastian Koch finds the right combination of poetic detachment and watchful sophistication for Dreyman. Martina Gedeck, as his girlfriend, has the most challenging role, since she's buffeted from all sides: by her suspicious partner, by Stasi agents trying to turn her, and by a lecherous Culture Minister. Ulrich Mühe plays the Stasi agent's transformation with reserve, only hinting at the stages in his character's secret, but decisive, change of heart.<br/><br/>Director von Donnersmarck, a blue-blooded West German, has re-created the gray, drained look of the former East, and the nature of Stasi intimidation, with a fidelity that has earned the praise of East Germans. His pacing is relaxed, but doesn't drag; although there are a few longueurs, most scenes unfold at just the right pace, and there are several great set-pieces. One is a bone-rattling episode in the Stasi canteen in which a young recruit is caught telling a joke about East German premier Erich Honecker. Another is the penultimate scene, a masterstroke in which Dreyman gains access to his massive Stasi file, while reading it, suddenly understands episodes of his own life which had never made sense to him before. The ending is perfectly judged; bittersweet and moving without swelling strings or teary confessions.<br/><br/>Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie, probably a great one. If it's not picked up for international distribution, it will be a bitter loss for thousands of potential moviegoers in other countries."

","I wonder why there has been so little written and publicized about this movie. This should be seen in every country and its merits trumpeted from the skies.<br/><br/>It starts off slowly and the locale is the former East Germany, inhabited by 16 million people who are being spied upon relentlessly by their secret police. In this very real world of the Berlin Wall, there are many Stasi, 90,000, overseeing the populace, aided and abetted by hundreds of thousands of informants. Many of these snitches were blackmailed or other pressures exerted (threats to children and loved ones) and a few obliged voluntarily.<br/><br/>What is truly amazing is that this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial debut, and he maintains a masterful hand throughout and keeps the story and the tension rolling from the first scene of interrogation which is filmed back and forth between a tape educating new Stasi as to interview techniques and to the actual cell itself where it was recorded.<br/><br/>The movie circles around three main characters and there is a wider circle of the powerful who pull the puppet strings for a variety of reasons which become clear as the movie unfolds.<br/><br/>First is Georg Dreyman, a playwright on the verge of celebrating his 40th birthday. Sebastian Koch, a tall,handsome actor dressed in writerly rumple, shares an apartment with his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and exists within the strictures of the state-sponsored theatre. He is a decent man, and tries to win support for his blacklisted friends.<br/><br/>For reasons that become quite clear, Dreyman falls under suspicion and the whole sophisticated Stasi spying system comes into play in the era of 1984. His whole apartment is bugged and every sound is monitored.<br/><br/>The man in charge of all this is Captain Gerd Wiesler,(Ulrich Mühe). Ulrich's performance is nothing short of stunning. He starts as an almost robotic presence, dressed in gray, he almost disappears into every scene he's in. But one detects a clear intelligence in his bright eyes, the only part of him that's alive. Captain Wiesler lives in a non-descript arborited apartment, much like himself. He squeezes his food onto a plate from a tube.<br/><br/>But the captain starts to awaken slowly as he listens surreptitiously on the state of the art equipment secreted in the attic of Dreyman's building. He starts to fall in love with the couple and then pressure from above is brought to bear on him to dig for the dirt in Dreyman's life.<br/><br/>And he is in a dilemma now, as he is drawn further and further into the life of Dreman and his girlfriend.<br/><br/>I won't throw spoilers down. Suffice to say is that the story is enthralling right down to the very last frame. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable and the world of East Germany meticulously drawn with the viewer respected enough to find his or her own emotional path through the plot.<br/><br/>The ending is truly one of a kind. So right and true that I was left nodding, it was the only one possible.<br/><br/>A must see, I will sing the praises of this film to all I know. 10 out of 10 from me. Right up there in my top 50 of all time. I find it so disappointing that these movies don't get wider release AND compete for an Oscar in the best picture of the year and not just for best foreign film. Now there's a heretical thought!"

","I do agree with all the other positive comments, and just need to add that this is the very first movie about the former GDR I saw that is not something like a comedy. Flicks like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""Good bye Lenin"" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself (a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of ""Mickey Mouse State"" full of stupid but charming characters, not really to be taken seriously. After seeing ""Das Leben der Anderen"" this impression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall. This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of the former East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director for making this movie. 10 out of 10."
"anastasia_smile","10","410","458","24 March 2006"," Intelligent and moving dealing with GDR history
","East Berlin, November 1984. Five years before its downfall the GDR seeks to maintain its power with the help of a merciless system of control and observation. When Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz puts loyal Stasi-Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler on to the famous writer Georg Dreymann and his girlfriend Christa Maria Sieland who is a famous actress herself, he expects career advancement for himself. For most important politicians are responsible for this ""operative act"".<br/><br/>What Wiesler did not expect: the intimate view on the world of the ones he's observing changes the snitch as well. Looking at ""the life of the others"" makes him aware of the beggarliness in his own life and enables access to a so far unknown world of love, free thinking and speaking he is hardly able to elude. But the system can't be stopped anymore and a dangerous game, which destroys the love of Christa Maria Sieland and Georg Dreymann and Wieslers present existence begins. <br/><br/>Until the fall of the wall each of them has paid a big price. After that a whole new world begins.<br/><br/>My personal opinion - though it doesn't count that much - is that this one a an absolute Must See. I can hardly remember such an intelligent and moving German movie especially not including the whole topic of GDR history and the dealing with it. I think this is the first German movie which shows this system as it used to be (which has been confirmed by several contemporary witnesses) and not turns it and its people into comedy though there have been several good ones, of course."
"drgyn2000","10","100","108","13 April 2007"," Best film in years
","After seeing the outstanding Pan's Labyrinth, I could not understand how anything could beat it to the Oscar for Best Film, let alone the accolade of Best Foreign Film. That was until I saw The Lives of Others.<br/><br/>Putting it simply, this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn't know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.<br/><br/>As a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric, with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction, that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted, and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid, is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.<br/><br/>In summary, this is film-making at its finest. It is the sort of movie that you'll go down on bended knee and pay homage to the inventor of cinema, because it is films like this that cinema was created for. You'll forgive a year of tedious sequels and cash cows, for the one day that films like this get released.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 is too modest."

","I've been taking German lessons for about 2 months now, and since movies were great in helping me learn English language I'm always looking for German films to watch (as well as German music to listen to) in order to educate my ears.<br/><br/>Anyway, I went to this place where I get all sort of rare movies and this one caught my attention... and I had no idea it got the Oscar for foreign language film this year! So I watched it without prejudice and... what did I find? A MASTERPIECE! This is the kind of movie that gets your attention from the first moment, and makes you interested in understanding the characters' psyche, which is very varied: you have the idealistic good guys, the idealistic bad guys, the people that broad their minds understanding that no political dogma is better than individual freedom, etc. And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved.<br/><br/>In this present day, when the ghost of authoritarian regimes still fly over our heads (in my country we're getting closer and closer to that reality), this movie will make you think about how important love, life and freedom are.<br/><br/>A must see!"

","This film utterly blew me away. Full disclosure: I'm a German born (Munich born) German-American who left Germany in 1986, before the wall came down. I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few words were spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habit of speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. I cannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall coming down. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmare years of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal, convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have the potential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thank you Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of my lost soul in this single ""es ist für mich"". I am reminded again that the difference between ourselves and beasts is that we have a choice."

","Germany has produced some very good movies recently ... but this one is in a class of its own. The main power of a quality movie, for me, has always been two things, a good story and mood - and this film has both. The story keeps you interested through all 139 minutes. You actually feel yourself transported to the 1980s of the former German republic. They have carefully chosen locations that looks east-germanish ... lots of ""Trabant"" cars on the streets :-) and the general grayish mood is very well recreated. The ordinary peoples fear of the Stasi is realistically portrayed. And i just love the twist in the story in the last 20 minutes or so. A brilliant movie that anyone even remotely interested in non-mainstream movies should see."

","Memories of the 70's and 80's visits in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) flood my mind while watching this film. Some are revolting, some comical and others are frightening. As a student of German, I visited the GDR several times to see pen pal friends. I remember one friend looking around and whispering to me in the S-Bahn - just in case one of the many ""IM's"" (unofficial workers of the Stasi) was listening in.<br/><br/>I visited a representative of a magazine for western countries about the GDR and spent one memorable weekend sightseeing with her. Near the end of my visit, she asked me if I would work for them regularly by writing my opinion of ""GDR Review"" and its suitability for readers in the West. I would be paid in GDR money to use during further visits. After politely refusing this ""offer"" (""The police at home might not like it!""), I always had a sneaking suspicion that that was an attempt by the Stasi to recruit me.<br/><br/>Years later I applied to see my ""Stasi File"". I will never forget the feeling deep inside me when I read in it: ""..is not suitable for our use due to his apparent connection to the police in his homeland."" The beautiful, friendly lady in Dresden had been a Stasi informer all the time! All of my visits to the GDR and the people I visited were listed in that file. For me ""The Lives of Others"" is an authentic representation of that totalitarian state. I am glad that those times have ended. <br/><br/>Congratulations on a well deserved Oscar!"

","I saw this film in its North American premiere in a packed theater at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival this past week and was pleased to be part of a standing ovation at the end for the director and star, who were both on hand.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others,"" set in East Germany not long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, tells the moving story of a police investigator forced to confront himself and the work he does. In a society poisoned by secrecy, fear and the abuse of power, a number of the movie's characters -- artists, actors, writers -- must look deep inside and decide what they are made of; none more so than the investigator.<br/><br/>This is a movie that took me to a place and time that felt very authentic, for a tale that was very satisfying.<br/><br/>Ulrich Muhe, who plays the investigator, is mesmerizing, and the young director is to be applauded for this, his first full-length film.

"Cloudmeister","9","49","56","17 April 2007"," Every positive word written about this movie is absolutely true
","I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004's magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven's stunning Black Book from last year, not just because these films share two actors. This multi-faceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it's hype says.<br/><br/>Sebastian Koch in particular absolutely shines. He is one of the best international actors working today and he follows the brilliance of his role in Black Book with the lead here. With his bohemian, dishevelled good looks and brilliant charisma, he's the best German-speaking actor since Bruno Ganz. But he is far from the only good actor in this movie, Ulrich Mühe as the State Security (Stasi) agent whose task it is to monitor Koch's suspiciously free thinking playwright, brings another near perfect performance to the movie. Agent Wiesler initially appears to the audience as the polar opposite of Koch's character. With his grey button down clothing, closely cropped hair and consistently emotionless face he symbolises everything about the overbearing untrusting Socialist government of East Germany that is wrong. He could easily have remained that character throughout the whole film but he becomes the surprising emotional centre of the story and the line between heroes and villains is significantly shifted (something which extends to the supporting cast as well. Truth be told there are probably only two characters in this film whom I didn't have to rethink my opinion of). Weisler reveals himself as a lonely, isolated man who risks his entire career as his attitude to his subject changes from one of mistrust to one of near-adoration. There is an undeniable link between the two characters even though they never share a single scene and Georg Dreyman (Koch) doesn't even find about Wiesler until the last 10 minutes of the movie, which leads us up to what should go down as one of the greatest endings in cinema history. Just thinking about the final spoken lines brings the tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>As I said, without a doubt one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. And as much as I adore Pan's Labyrinth, this one really did deserve it's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. An absolute masterpiece."

","When I first heard about Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's film ""Das Leben der Anderen"" and the issue it dealt with, I instantly tipped it to be one of the must-see films. As a great cinema-goer and a genuine admirer of the European cinematography, I was overwhelmed with a notion that a succession of thought-provoking German films would be continued with this moving insight into the lives of others at a very delicate period of the 80s in East Germany. After months of waiting, the Serbian audience was presented with ""Das Leben der Anderen"" during The Belgrade Film Festival and we related to it to the extent that whilst leaving the cinema many of us commented on how pleased we would be to see it win the Oscar. And it did, the very same night.<br/><br/>What makes ""Das Leben der Anderen"" so brilliant to me is the choice of topic- an account of the years of dangerous living in East Germany, during which almost everyone was dubbed suspicious by the Stasi, until after careful and detailed examination the opposite was proved, the obsession with the non-existent enemies of the non-existent prosperity, the overall greyness of the atmosphere in East Berlin. And then, there is also the process that the character of Wiesler undergoes, unveiling the emptiness of his own existence, the process presented with the subtle pace that Donnersmarck dexterously set. The ending is one of the most powerful ones that I have ever seen, containing just the right words- It is for me- spoken by a man who for the first time in his life seems to be doing something for himself, a man who had no life of his own, who lived through other people's lives, but also- It is for me- the words spoken to denote that somebody out there (Dreyman) actually dedicated something (Die Sonate vom guten Menschen) to him.<br/><br/>A gripping story of what happened somewhere in East Berlin to somebody else, not us, or maybe a reminder of what happened to many of us at some other place, at some other time, a reminder that came to life through the lives of others somewhere in Berlin.<br/><br/>So powerful, so beautifully crafted.

"sissoed","9","28","33","17 May 2007"," Excellent film, insightful character studies
","This film, set in the theater world of the mid-1980s, was particularly satisfying to me because I was a producer of avant-garde theater through the 1980s, based in San Francisco but often on tour -- including to international theater festivals in West Germany, communist Poland and communist Yugoslavia in 1987. Although my experience as an American was of course very different than the experience of these East Berliners, there is a mood and sense of personalities in this film that I found authentic and familiar. The people in this film feel like the people I met in the festival bars and refreshment centers for participating artists and on panel discussions in those festivals. <br/><br/>Many commenters here have noted the important character change of the Stasi agent, attributing the change either to his growing appreciation for the humanity of the playwright and the actress, or else complaining that the transformation is unpersuasive. So far as I've read in the comments, no one has focused on the key scene. When the Stasi agent hears the playwright and friends planning the suicide article to be smuggled to the West, he writes up an accurate report on this and hastens to his boss's office. Up until then, whatever sympathies he may have developed for the playwright or for the actress are inadequate to deter him. <br/><br/>But when the agent enters the boss's office, the boss doesn't immediately give him a chance to give the report or to say anything -- instead the boss immediately launches into a discussion of a new study analyzing how to interrogate and intimidate artists and writers. The report categorizes writers and artists into 5 basic personality types. The boss says the playwright is a ""type 4."" He describes how the prescribed approach to intimidate ""type 4"" writers will result in them losing hope and never writing again. <br/><br/>Only after hearing this, and realizing that his report exposing the playwright as the author of the suicide paper will result in the playwright being crushed emotionally and never even wanting to write anything new, does the Stasi agent curl up the report in his hands and decide not to give the report to his boss. The agent's precise motivation is unclear. But it cannot be merely that the agent wants the playwright to be able to continue writing new works. The agent must know that the state will never let the playwright do another play or publish anything, if the playwright's authorship of the suicide paper is known, and yet the agent was ready to expose the playwright anyway. So the agent's motive for suddenly deciding to hide his report is not merely because the state will put the playwright on a blacklist and block him from publishing or getting plays produced. <br/><br/>Thus it must be that the agent is motivated to change by feeling a general revulsion against the idea that the state should employ the crushing of hope, of creative spirit, as a strategy for responding to a dissenter whom the agent knows is a genuine supporter of the regime but who sees that it has flaws. It is the fact that the state will destroy the playwright's very desire to write, that causes the agent to change. It isn't clear whether the agent would draw back from inflicting that kind of punishment on any artist, even one whom he felt to be a real enemy of the state, but it is clear that he can't bring himself to inflict it on a man whom he feels is a ""good"" man like the playwright. And the agent believes the playwright is ""good"" because the playwright supports what is good about society, tries to correct what is wrong about society, is loyal even to a friend who has made powerful enemies, and treats his lover with compassion even when it appears the lover is betraying him.<br/><br/>And the irony -- a good irony -- is that by acting to preserve the playwright's desire to write, the agent winds up being the focus of the playwright's novel -- a novel born of a desire and drive to write that the agent himself kept the state from destroying.<br/><br/>Thus it seems to me that the real message of this movie is that even the most unimaginative, bland, uncreative, rigid people -- such as the Stasi agent -- should appreciate and protect the desire that drives creative people who are also ""good"" people to create works of art and literature."

Col in The Crying Game <br/><br/>WhenI saw 2006's Oscar winning Departed, I was satisfied it could be the best picture of the year; then I saw Pan's Labyrinth and thought it imaginatively superior; then I saw Lives of Others, the Oscar choice for best foreign film, and I knew it was the globe's best film of the year, no argument.<br/><br/>Lives of Others is what all movie making should strive to be: interesting characters, thrilling plot, superb acting, and thematic weight. It's set in East Berlin, 1984, five years before the Wall's fall and Gorbachev's ""glasnost"" and still felling the tremors of Nazism, in this case the Stasi, a government agency similar to the SS. Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a Stasi teacher and coldly efficient information gatherer, surreptitiously watches playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) to get compromising details that would damn Dreyman and open the romantic way for the culture minister, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme). Oddly for an artist, Dreyman is loyal to socialism, so it is through Sieland that the information must come.<br/><br/>The dramatic hub of this absorbing intrigue is the growing affection Wiesler gains for the actress and coincidentally the underground freedom movement, mostly as it is represented by artists and their friends. While his efficiency is amply evident in his cool detachment, similar to that of Rafe Fiennes in Schindler's List and Serg Lopez in Pan's Labyrinth, his humanity seeps out at the edges as he becomes vicariously involved in the artists' lives. First-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck misses not a beat in slowly revealing the hearts of all his principals while he creates a plot remarkably interesting for a character-driven piece.<br/><br/>Few films could mine the rich conflict between the totalitarian state and artists who yearn for freedom of expression, between the loyalties of friends and lovers and the crushing exigency of survival. Lives of Others shows how difficult it is to watch others' lives unfold and not be drawn to their passion. It's rough out there: No other film of 2006 showed that cliché better. Here's looking at you, best film of the year."

","Das Leben der Anderen (2006) (The Lives of Others) was brilliantly written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The film is a taut thriller. It's also a dramatization of what happened in East Germany--and could happen here--if we allow the government access to every aspect of our lives. Ulrich Mühe stars as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler of the Stasi--the dreaded secret police. The Captain is so talented in interrogation that he gives lectures on interrogation techniques to Stasi cadets.<br/><br/>For complex reasons, Wiesler is investigating a prominent couple-- Christa-Maria Sieland, a beautiful and talented actor (Martina Gedeck), and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) an accomplished author and playwright.<br/><br/>Artists in East Germany were strictly controlled by the state. Some of them played an intricate cat-and-mouse game with the Stasi--going just far enough to attract notice, but not so far as to bring about arrest. The problem with the cat-and-mouse game was that the cats had very sharp teeth, which they didn't hesitate to use. Blacklisting was just one of the state's weapons--a single word from a high official and you never acted again, or your plays or music were never performed. Although both Christa-Maria and Georg have been careful and discrete, they haven't been careful and discrete enough to escape the Stasi's interest. <br/><br/>The movie, although in color, looks as if it were shot in black and white. The mood and the locations are drab and muted. Obviously, the color reflects the political and social situation of the time. The camerwork and editing were outstanding. Every other aspect of the film is equally excellent, particularly the work of the supporting actors. <br/><br/>Not only does this film represent a riveting thriller, but it provides a powerful political message. After you've seen The Lives of Others, you won't keep quiet when someone tells you ""I don't care if the government taps my phone; I've got nothing to hide.""<br/><br/>This is an extraordinary film--well acted and directed, with a compelling plot and message. Das Leben der Anderen is the finest movie I've seen this year. It's definitely worth seeking out."
"johno-21","10","25","31","9 March 2007"," Sonata for a Good Man
","This film is set in the Orlwellian year of 1984 in the old German Democratic Republic of what was known as East Berlin. The Stasi are the ""Shield and the Sword"" of the ruling party of this soviet bloc nation, a secret police force of 100,000 that subjugates another 300,000 to spy for them. This totalitarian system is based on a need to know everything about the countries populace of 16 million. Everything is meticulously documented. Big Brother keeps tabs on any it deems worthy of investigation. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a button-down bureaucratic establishmentarian who works as a Stasi interrogator and as an instructor in the school for Stasi. His old schoolmate Lt. Col Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) is now his immediate superior. In an attempt to further his career, Grubitz wants to impress Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and orders Wiesler to set up an elaborate eavesdropping stakeout to gather information on playwright George Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Dreyman is a playwright loyal to the party but most his contemporaries have not been including his favorite director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Leinert) who has been blacklisted. Dreyman's live-in girlfriend is the popular stage actress Christina- Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who is also the object of amorous affection from the sinister, shades of gestapo-like Hemph. This is no ordinary spy thriller. Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature film debut gives the screen this wonderfully compelling story of life behind the Iron Curtain in the years leading to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and continues into 1991 after the reunification of Germany. Wonderful camera work from cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski enhances the stark realism of this film. This is the Academy Award winning Best Foreign Language Film of 2006. I had to see this since it beat out the highly favored Pan's Labyrinth for the Oscar. It's evident to me that Lives of Others is the superior film and the Academy got it right. This film flows so smoothly and your eyes are constantly on every movement on the screen that it's hard to believe you are reading subtitles too. Gabriel Yared's original composition for the film ""Sonata for a Good Man"" is a pivotal piece of it's storyline. I can't help but give this film my highest rating of a 10 out of 10 and I would highly recommend it."
"filmbuff1974","10","22","28","25 January 2007"," Excellent Film
","I won't go into the plot.The film concerns East Germany during the eighties at it's most oppressive.The film is engrossing and so absorbing that I forgot I was reading subtitles all through it.Well worth the evening. The Lives of Others is what film is supposed to do which is to make one think about one's life and the society one is living in.<br/><br/>I should say that the promotional poster is very misleading and I fear it will hurt this outstanding film.Those nude couples is absolutely not what this film is about.This is not some film about a group of self-absorbed adults jumping in and out of beds to put some excitement into their dull lives.This is a political film involving adults who are trying to live life freely in a very oppressive environment.The publicists should really re-think their promotional campaign."
"emdonald","10","24","31","4 February 2007"," Best film I have seen...perhaps ever!
","This is an incredible film. I had heard nothing about it until a friend suggested we take a look. I entered the cinema without a clue what it was about and whether it was going to be any good. It turned out to be stupendously good. The characters were brilliantly wholesome and the story was lacking in nothing.<br/><br/>The film is set in the 1980's in Germany and details the lives of those living under the regime in East Germany, focusing on some of the more ""controversial"" types in society; namely artists, play writes and actors. The relationships really tug at your heart and the turn of events is entirely unexpected.<br/><br/>I cannot believe that there is so little written about it but suggest that you see it now."
"badpritt","10","17","21","5 January 2009"," best movie i've ever seen
","Dear Hollywood, <br/><br/>would you mind watching this tremendous work and finally learn that to shock your audience you don't need a gun blowing someone's head off. You need an actor raising his eye brow, a single look, a simple movement of her hand. Yes, I know, you can't sell a movie around the world if you can't make sure anyone of any cultural background will get what is meant to be expressed. Yes, blowing someone's head off makes clear the poor fellow is dead and the other guy is evil and ruthless and needs to be tracked down. Yes, taxi driver is a fantastic masterpiece. But did it really have to end in a massacre? <br/><br/>It is subtlety that turns a movie with good actors and good plot into an incredible one. The Lives of Others is pure subtlety. I hope it will never be forgotten."
"jozsefbiro","9","21","27","14 January 2008"," A great movie about mediocrity, thoroughness, morality and power.
","Mediocrity, thoroughness, morality, power. These words come into my mind after seeing this very German movie, which is otherwise also a great movie. It has a great atmosphere, giving back the grey world of the DDR: grey buildings, grey Trabants and Wartburgs, grey people, a country ruled by mediocrity even in its colours.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a thorough world: the Stasi thoroughly maintains the files about the many suspects, the agents thoroughly install the bugs in their flats and thoroughly watch them. (Later in the unified Germany they thoroughly maintain the very same files and make them open for everyone. A thorough nation, the Germans.)<br/><br/>But the Germans also value morality and this is also evident in the movie. The moral awakening causes the otherwise conformist writer to challenge the Communist power and the very same moral attitude causes the much less typical and much less anticipated awakening of the Stasi agent watching the writer. The latter transformation is clearly more exciting, as the grey, mediocre, thorough and lonely Stasi agent, the loyal servant realizes the real nature of the Communist power during the observation of the writer and her wife. In the end he also challenges this power in his own humble way. <br/><br/>The story should also be instructive for us Hungarians, as it shows an example of how a nation should handle its dark past. The Germans already did a fairly impressive ""brainwash"" after WWII to reach a catharsis on the sinful Nazi past and they did a similarly impressive moral confrontation in the 90's with their Communist past and the Stasi. I envy them, because we Hungarians have failed in this. The Germans consistently opened all the Stasi files, and allowed everyone to go and see who had been watched and who had been the agents and the informers.<br/><br/>In Hungary, this did not happen. What happened instead was that many of the informers became prominent politicians (other professions exposed to the public like artists, journalists, church officials were/are also heavily ""infected"") and the files were used to blackmail them, or to get rid of them in a few occasions. Not exactly the right way to purify the society. And the society is indeed far from being purified: they just do not really care if it turns out that some prominent person was an informer back in the Communist era. So, when such files come to the public, the former agent just says some weak excuses (""I was forced into this"" and "" I always tried to defend the people around me"" and ""I never wrote anything harmful"", etc.) and then everything continues as before.<br/><br/>This was what happened to Oscar-winner film director István Szabó whose story is particularly striking. An article was published in a weekly uncovering the fact that he was an informer back in the early 60's. His personal post-scandal behaviour is a typical example of trying to get away with feeble excuses. The reaction of the society was an example of accepting these cheap excuses without criticism, just because Szabó was an otherwise famous, talented and popular person, a ""nice"" guy.<br/><br/>And this is a pity: Szabó is one of the few informers who could have stood up and confess his ""sins"" without losing his authenticity, because Szabó the artist has done the confession. His best films showed how the power can corrupt talented but weak persons, how one can lose one's integrity. He got his Oscar for exploring this very topic in Mephisto, (and he got Oscar nominations for two other similar movies with Brandauer). And then he did confront this issue even more explicitly in Taking sides, too. And he did it in the right way, exposing all the complexity and all the moral issues. So, it is indeed a pity he could not do it in the right way in his personal life. And it is indeed a pity that we Hungarians could not do it the right way. The Germans did."
"gurkpeter","7","11","13","12 August 2009"," Valid story from the Communist era
","The story presents an era of total surveillance where anything not in line with the will of the party leaders is punished. Arguments do not exist, just the use of power. I think the story is valid. However it only reflects how people from the West can imagine, interpret and understand life in East Germany. During watching this film I had ambivalent feelings. Ulrich Mühe's performance really gives an authentic example of a Stasi officer and gives us a real feeling what the totalitarian system means. However I think the film lacks authenticity in some sense. Only those feel this subtle lack who have lived in an Easter European country. As a verification I guessed which actor has grown up in East Germany and which not. Then I checked their biographies that 90% confirmed my guesses. Those who have not grown up in East Germany only act. Those who lived in the totalitarian system really give us the authenticity. In summary, I think this is a very good film and the only I know of that exposes the surveillance of totalitarian systems. The performance of Ulrich Mühe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler alone make this film worth seeing. For those who might be interested in the topic I recommend reading the book Celestial Harmonies: A Novel from Péter Esterházy and its second part (Celestial Harmonies: A Novel (P.S.)). In film you could watch any film from Krzysztof Kieslowski, Péter Gothár or Péter Bacsó."
"guyincognito1","9","5","5","29 November 2011"," Profound tale of morality.
","This is an absolutely fantastic film, with a very suitable soundtrack and great performances from the whole cast, which performs perfectly. <br/><br/>Little things, like facial expressions, reactions, etc. are so important on the big screen, and are so difficult to get right. It says a lot for the talent on set that this film was an absolute joy to watch, especially as all these 'little things' were executed to perfection. As Wiesler grows to love his subjects, it is, of course, a gradual change, and Ulrich Muehe, with the help of a tender and fantastic script, pulls his character off so convincingly. <br/><br/>What is very interesting about this film is the way in which it portrays West Germany. Von Donnersmarck has not directed a love-letter to the West; he portrays its faults just as he portrays those of the East, and of the Ministerium fuer Staatssicherheit (Stasi), and there are some very thought-provoking issues and ideas within the film. <br/><br/>Ultimately, whether the right thing is done or not, a transformation occurs within the film, one for a more fulfilling existence. I'll leave you to decide whether or not it is for the better, but I truly believe that this film is an enriching experience for all who watch it. You really get the sense that the actors cared for the themes and issues that the film raised, and this can only ever make a film better. <br/><br/>The film is not without tension, which is expertly tackled by fast editing and music, and not without sadness, loss, and pain. Characters are more deeply explored than you first realize, and, often, they are not so different. They are, after all, all socialists. <br/><br/>Not often does one come across a classic film, one with just the right amount of classiness, messages, and imagery, amongst other things, and it is a genuine pleasure when one falls into your lap. Watch this film. I promise that you will not be disappointed."
"asda-man","9","5","5","16 August 2011"," You'll be watching it like the Stasi!
","Films like ""The Lives of Others"" don't come around very often, as the film industry is dominated by loud Hollywood blockbusters with no real substance (Helena Bonham Carter would agree with me :) this, an overlooked film because it's foreign and quieter than dominating films, deserves a much wider audience. Anyone could watch ""The Lives of Others"" and be touched and perhaps moved by the wonderful acting and deeply drawn out characters (unless you're under 5, but we'll let you off!)<br/><br/>If you appreciate fine acting, this is a great film to watch. Because in foreign films you can't understand what they're saying (generally) I usually find it difficult to tell if they're acting well or not, but in ""The Lives of Others"" you can tell that they're delivery and performance is fantastic. Right down to the main characters walk! It also helps it to flesh out the wonderfully drawn characters. They're in-depth and you find yourself being emotionally attached to them as the Stasi man watching them! You increasingly want to see more of them making for truly compelling viewing!<br/><br/>The directing also adds to how compelling the film is. It's very delicate and clever in the way he tries only to show the couple in the way Wiesler also sees them, so when his shift is over, we as an audience also stop seeing the family which helps us to understand how Wiesler is so compelled with their lives and also makes it exceedingly gripping! Although, I think that the directing could've afforded to be more intense than it was, but that's only a small flaw.<br/><br/>The writing is incredibly intelligent and also gives you good insight to the split Germany before the Berlin wall came down. It's interesting and moving with a very touching ending. The screenplay also doesn't fear about delving deeply into the characters either. It's full of excellent characterisation and brings up some delicate themes in the correct manner.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" is a truly masterful film, every element that makes a classic film comes together perfectly. I can bet that in 50 years time ""The Lives of Others"" will still be watched and cherished. It's just a shame it doesn't get the recognition it deserves! Even if you don't feel that ""The Lives of Others"" isn't your thing, please just give it a go and I bet that'll you'll be moved and compelled by the experience. A must see!"

","I had heard about this this film over the years and the animation that it inspired in people had drifted in and out of my consciousness, I must watch it..and then, I did, and it surprised me, it shocked me and it stayed, like a stain on my mind, difficult to wash away, nagging with layers and meaning. An incredible study of selflessness, selfishness, sexuality, relationships and despair, and yet there is in the bleached out cinematography, and the bleached out humanity, a wisp of hope and retribution. I won't add a spoiler, but if you like, it's denouement in the real world only adds to it's tragedy and it's lingering like smoke on your clothes after a night in a bar, a memory full of the joy of experience and the pain of experience."

","First of all, I must say that the action of the movie is hard to understand for those who didn't live in the former communist countries from eastern Europe. As one who live in such a country, I think this movie is a masterpiece and Ulrich Muhe made a brilliant role, and maybe he's the man who should win the Oscar this year. In a world full of suspicion and secret services entering every people's life, the STASI officer risks his job for a noble cause, which the communists hated at that time - THE CULTURE. A really amazing production and a page of history ""written"" with genius by the crew of this film. Congratulations !"
"the_weirdo","9","12","15","8 January 2010"," Others' Lives
","I am a huge fan of German intellect. Their Philosophy. Their Literature. Their Science. One thing relating to the Germans that I am not that big a fan of is their entertainment. And my impression is mostly limited to the free television progammes they offer and honestly I get verily bored by those when I stay there.<br/><br/>But with so much hype associated with this movie (being included in most of the top 10 lists of movies after 2000), I couldn't resist my curiosity and decided to go for it. I am so wrong about German movies. This one in particular is definitely one of the best movies I have seen.<br/><br/>Before the Germany reunification, East Germany had this totalitarian government that was accused of infringing privacy of the citizens putting them into 24 hours surveillance to monitor any anti-government activities. The story involves an interrogation and surveillance specialist STASI (State Security) officer given a task of monitoring the life of a writer. But soon he discovers the misuse of power of the higher officials for personal benefit and his faith in the system withers down. And more he listens to the life of others he gets slowly absorbed in their lives living it with them. But the question was how far he could go?<br/><br/>The direction is absorbing. The performance of the actors are fantastic. Remember 'The Green Mile'? This movie grips you like that one. It starts slow but becomes so engaging that it drags audience into the movie living with the actors. I was moved and intrigued with the dilemma each character was facing. I was living the lives of others.<br/><br/>(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)"
"flb87","9","12","15","20 November 2009"," Character development
","I have already found a lot of useful comments on this film, so my intention is not to repeat those comments. For me, this movie was really good, so I am a follower of the positive reviews I have read.<br/><br/>What I would like to do, is comment on the negative reviews I have read about the character development, and in particular the role of Ulrich Muhe (Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler).<br/><br/>A lot of people state that the transition from a very strict Stasi agent to the helpful 'friend' isn't realistic and human. When you look at how extremely strict and haunting the man was beforehand, he just couldn't turn into a good guy all of a sudden, they say.<br/><br/>I disagree with that. When you look at it from a psychological point of view, it makes clear sense to me. It is very well known that just before a person admits his wrongdoing, he is at his most extreme in denying it! The more he is confronted with the fact that his methods are unethical, the more he will try to find arguments to defend his methods. A great example of this is the scene where the student in Wiesler's class comments on the brutal interrogations Wiesler has pulled off. Wiesler answers by saying that this is just the way things go in the DDR, and that the student better get used to that.<br/><br/>Another example of why the transformation of Wiesler is so credible, is the fact that he hasn't got a life of his own. This is perfectly illustrated by the scenes in Wiesler's home. Every evening he returns to his home, finding it empty. He cooks (awefull) for himself and orders prostitutes to satisfy his sexual needs. In that particular scene he even asks the prostitute to stay longer. This illustrates even more how lonely the poor guy is. Also, this loneliness and 'lack of own life' perfectly illustrate the title of this movie. Wiesler doesn't have a life of his own, and therefore 'lives the life of others' when he's sitting in the attic listening to the lives that happen beneath him.<br/><br/>A final argument for the credibility of the transition is the piano play Georg Dreyman plays after his good friend, the director and writer Albert Jerska, dies: 'die Sonate vom guten Menschen' or 'The sonata of good people'. This is the key moment for the transition. Wiesler then perfectly realizes that his work is pointless and unethical. That by doing it, he will never become a good man, and will never have a worthy life of his own. He is confronted with the rich life of the poets and artists, and discovers how beautiful a normal and free life can be. From that point on, he changes radically, and decides that he is no longer a part of an unethical, inhuman system. To me, this all perfectly fits.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is one of the best movie in years. And I hope that I have offered clear arguments on why the transformation of Wiesler is not a wrong and unrealistic move, but instead a great enrichment of the movie."
"Galina_movie_fan","10","13","17","24 September 2007"," 1984, East Germany - Shield and Sword of the Party know everything
","""The Lives of Others"", the 2007 very deserving Oscar winner for the Best Foreign Film is IMO, the best film of last year regardless of the country it was made in. It took its writer/director several years first to thoroughly research still very painful events of the recent German history, the ones that deal with infamous and evil STASI (State Secret Police) and how it infiltrated and affected almost every aspect of GDR life. Before the collapse of the Soviet system and its most ominous and infamous symbol, the wall in the end of the 80s, life in East Germany of 1984 had imitated art precisely like in the prophetic and terrifying George Orwell's novel. Each citizen could have and majority were closely monitored by STASI which motto was ""Shield and Sword of the Party"" and its goal, ""To know everything"". By the time East Germany collapsed in 1989, STASI employed an estimated 91,000 employees and 300,000 informants; about one in fifty East Germans collaborated with the powerful and Omni-present Secret Police, one of the most extensive infiltrations of a police apparatus in history. The STASI monitored political behavior among GDR citizens, and is known to have used torture and intimidation to mute, corrupt, and destroy dissent. Even those who believed they were above suspicion due to their closeness to the prominent members of the government were not safe. The film explores the lives of those who watched and listened and those on the other side of the wire.<br/><br/>I was shocked to find out that such astounding movie was a directorial debut of 33 years old Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - so artistically impeccable this honest, human, horrifying, harrowing yet hopeful film is. The film makers had recreated successfully and precisely the 1980s with its dark suffocating atmosphere of constant abuse of individual privacy in the former German Democratic republic. The locations, the huge dominating gray apartment buildings of the big city where every wall seems to have the ears and the eyes , the old cars on the streets of East Berlin  everything looks, sounds, and feels authentically . As great as ""The Lives of Others is"", it would not have been the same without Ulrich Mühe, as Captain Gerd Wiesler, a highly skilled and efficient STASI officer and a loyal member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, who spies on successful playwright and his actress girlfriend by the order of corrupted hypocritical member of the government. While listening to the Lives of Others, Wiesler's own life would change in the way he had never expected.<br/><br/>Once you start watching the movie, you'll see how Ulrich Mühe effortlessly over towers every other performance on the screen, and they are all excellent. The real life of Ulrich Mühe could make a great and compelling movie and the script for ""The Lives of Others"" was written with him in mind. He was born, grew up, and became a famous actor in the Eastern Germany back in the late 70s of the last century. By the words of von Donnersmarck, STASI began spying on Mühe right after he had graduated from High School because STASI realized that he would be great even before he himself realized that. After German reunification, Mühe discovered evidence in his STASI file that he had been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theater, but also by his second wife, Jenny Gröllmann. This was denied by Gröllmann who, after an acrimonious and highly-publicized court case, succeeded in obtaining an injunction to prevent Mühe from repeating the allegation in a book. Mühe's response when asked how he prepared for his role in Das Leben der Anderen was simple, ""I remembered"". Mühe passed away few months ago, in July 2007 due to stomach cancer at the age or 54, and when I read it, I felt emptiness - like a very good close friend has gone forever. His performance in the film ""The Lives of Others"" will live always as one of the best and most memorable given by any actor of the screen."

","This is one of the best films I've seen recently. I won't add a summary; many have done a better job of this than I could. However, what I do want to add is that what makes this such a great film is not simply that it is a political film. If you enjoy a surprising love story, subtle and realistic character development, and an outstanding film score, see this film. You might learn something about East Germany in the process, but that's not the entire point of the film. At its heart, this is a film about people and its themes transcend the time period.<br/><br/>************SPOILER ALERT********One of my favorite parts of the film is the way that Wiesler, the Stasi agent, reveals very slowly how he is affected by his observation of ""Lazlo"" and ""CMS."" He becomes more and more involved in their love affair, which emphasizes his own lonely life. Clumsy attempts at human closeness are made: with a prostitute, then with a child, until he finally begins to contact the subjects themselves. At first this contact is electronic, by rigging a doorbell buzzer to ring at a crucial point. He then talks directly with Christa, showing complete understanding of her needs, while also understanding exactly how far he can go. Where he goes next is for you to see, but he sacrifices his own career to become a ""good man."" *****************END OF SPOILER***********************"
"Horst_In_Translation","10","9","11","19 May 2015"," Masterpiece, a unique lesson on humanity
","This is the first full feature film by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and won him a Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award as well as an uncountable number of other awards all around the world. The film runs for roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes and does not drag a single second. The reason for this is FHvD's outstanding script and a cast that delivers 100% from minute 1, also including all the actors in smaller roles such as Thomas Thieme, who gives a great performance of an influential figure not scared of using his political power to his own sexual advantage. The standout is Ulrich Mühe showing us his character's transformation from a ruthless Stasi (secret police) agent into a caring human being who puts his own freedom at risk in order to oppose a political system built on fear that is as rotten as it gets and protect the people suffering from it. Merely from the political perspective, in my opinion, this is a movie that everybody needs to see, especially those with an interest in history. And even for those who are not particularly fond of political films, this is highly recommended as the characters and their interaction are written and portrayed with such wit and accuracy that I am not shy of calling it the best German movie ever made. And I have seen lots.<br/><br/>I cannot even mention a favorite scene, there are just too many: the joke at the cafeteria table, the boy in the elevator, the interrogation between Mühe and Gedeck, threatening the neighbor('s daughter), the red color on the files near the end, the suicide references and so on. Or I could simply mention the entire epilogue, i.e. everything that happens in the movie after the Fall of the Wall. When Dreyman reads his file or how Wiesler enters the bookstore in the end are maybe the most moving moment of this film. Wiesler's last words are completely genius and I wish all films could end on such a high note. In general, his character and his transformation are one of the most interesting things I have seen in movies in the last years. There are many moments one could analyze, so I will just mention one. Pay attention to how he is looking for real togetherness during his meeting with the prostitute and thus cannot understand the affair between Gedeck's and Thieme's character. His faith in the system crumbles more and more as he realizes everybody is just interested in themselves, while he initially believes in the idea(l) of socialism. But the people in his organization are so different compared to everything he believes in that finally the whole concept of the GDR crumbles in his mind before it crumbles in reality. There is no point anymore in punishing the people who offend his country as he realizes they are the ones who are correct and he uses all the means in his power to help them without becoming part of an investigation himself.<br/><br/>It's so sad to see that Ulrich Mühe died so quickly after this film, even before his posthumous BAFTA nomination. But we should be grateful to see the legacy he left us here. What surprises me a bit is that Henckel von Donnersmarck has worked so little in recent years. He only made one movie in the nine years since ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (a forgettable thriller with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie) and there is nothing upcoming on his body of work either. Maybe he really was a one-trick pony, but boy was that trick magnificent. A must-see. Perfect score."
"conlaw","10","10","13","28 January 2007"," A smart, tight, well-acted thriller
","This movie, though rather long, is well directed such that every frame is important. The musical score of the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra enhances the movie rather than dominating it.<br/><br/>The acting by all cast members is excellent - no one overacts. It all seems terribly real.<br/><br/>The movie's theme causes us to focus on how fragile our freedoms really are. The historical background is East Germany in the early to mid-1980's. The Stassi reigns supreme with the enlisted help of a multitude of informants such that no one can be trusted. One can easily imagine how North Americans have cause to worry if we continually give up our liberties for the sake of combating terrorism.<br/><br/>It is also a movie that speaks to a European culture that is now forced to assimilate the old USSR bloc. We get new sympathy for the hell that the East Germans and for that matter the citizens of other totalitarian regimes had to endure.<br/><br/>Yet, like in Schindler's List, the good in a man's heart ultimately triumphs. The juxtaposition of ""good man""/ ""bad man"" plays heavily throughout the film.<br/><br/>Without any chase scene or over-the-top special effects, the film pulls off what is arguably the best thriller of the year. It is well-deserving of its Academy Award nomination for best foreign language film."

","I have no words to describe the beauty of this movie.... I am awestruck. I thought no drama movie could come close to Shawshank Redemption, but The Lives of Others is just as good in my view. <br/><br/>In a world where Humanity is getting extinct, this movie shows that there is still hope - even from the most unlikeliest of places. 1980s East Germany was a tough place to live in; the people in power were the harshest and yet from there came the ray of light; that even someone reputed to be a cold-blooded and stone-hearted professional could be shaken on the inside.<br/><br/>Ulrich Mühe, hats off to him. His portrayal of a stone-cold government- official-turned-soft-hearted-Being was almost unreal. A truly Oscar- deserving performance which didn't get the award, but that doesn't change the fact that his acting was above extra-ordinary.<br/><br/>A 10/10 movie for me"
"Asa_Nisi_Masa2","9","8","10","4 May 2007"," ""Sonate vom guten Menschen"" also made this reviewer dewy-eyed!
","A deserving Oscar winner if ever there was one, though I was never one to pay special attention to the Oscars, I was almost shocked by how perfect this debut movie by a 34-year-old director very nearly was. Set in East Berlin in the mid-80s, some five years before the infamous Wall crumbled, it follows the STASI as they plot to find incriminating evidence against playwright Georg Dreyman, who'd been the regime's darling until a ruthless minister frivolously develops a lecherous desire to possess his girlfriend, renowned stage actress Christa-Maria Sieland. Though both Sebastian Koch (last seen by me as the Nazi Captain Müntze in Verhoeven's Black Book) and Martina Gedeck are excellent as the central couple trapped within the STASI's web of eavesdropping and paranoia tactics, the real hero and star of the movie is without a doubt Ulrich Mühe. I had last seen in Michael Haneke's Funny Games, where he played Georg, the unfortunate husband and dad who comes to a sticky end. In The Lives of Others, Mühe memorably fills the shoes of the STASI agent Gerd Wiesler who listened to Dreyman's daily life through the bugs in his flat. Balding, physically non-descript Wiesler conveys more with one subtle shift of an eyeball than the whole stellar cast of an Oliver Stone movie. This actor is so charismatic, he blows even the undeniably talented and handsome Sebastian Koch clear off the screen. In this movie not only are things seldom what they seem, but humanity and redemption can be found in the most ridiculously unexpected places.<br/><br/>Shocking, humane and moving yet never predictable, heavy-handed or melodramatic, the movie is also blessed by a solid script, a very plausible storyline free of plot holes and an immaculately researched scenario. I've read that both the movie's director and Mühe remember their experiences living in the Communist regime. Though the former was still very young, he claims to clearly remember the climate of paranoia he grew up in, while Mühe later discovered that he had been spied upon by his own wife! Oddly enough, one accusation levelled against the movie by some IMDb reviewers is that of misogyny. Being normally very sensitive to a discriminatory portrayal of women, I was very baffled by this. I've come to the conclusion that some touchy viewers expect their movie characters  especially those of women or ethnic minorities  to be paragons of virtue or role models, rather than simply human beings with flaws and plausible weaknesses. In my view Christa-Maria's main sin was not to be ""weak"", as some other viewers here claim, but simply ""human"". If anything, the movie also provided a damning portrait of the brutality of the regime against women.<br/><br/>Perhaps my only, very minor complaint with the movie was its ending, which felt a tad rushed - though it was a beautiful ending all the same - uplifting and sad, poetic and yet also grounded in the starkest reality."

","Germany has during the last few years produced a number of very worthwhile films that take stock of their somewhat chequered past. The incredible ""Untergang"" and the very funny ""Good Bye Lenin"" have to be the two most prominent ones. They have now been joined by the very classy ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives of Others). It is a must see film for everyone, and especially those with an interest in our near history. It is this incredible to think that less than 20 years ago such totalitarian regimes existed all over Europe. It is even more disturbing to realise that they still exist in places today.<br/><br/>Based around one surveillance case that offers many different takes on the same story ""Das Leben der Anderen"" brings home the totalitarian regime that was East Germany. It offers a great historical perspective while making you feel hope and joy. The acting is extremely good, it feels just as downplayed as I imagine life in the old DDR was. I don't imagine it will propel any of the actors to Hollowood greatness (many are already German acting veterans) but I really hope writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who also co-produced the film get his due credit.<br/><br/>It would be liberating (pardon the pun) to see this film claim top hon ours for best international film instead of the usual line up of Almodovar or Kaurismäki. Even if it doesn't, go see it."
"Chris Knipp","9","10","14","10 February 2007"," Beautifully restrained study of moral complexity and totalitarianism
","The Lives of Others/Das Leben der Anderenthe title of this striking German film points to the vicariousness of a world dominated by suspicion and surveillance. In East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down the STASI, the state police, wanted to watch everyone. In 1984 a file is opened and STASI men are set to work watching a man and a woman who are above reproach. In the paranoid world of the eastern zone, innocence itself, as in Kafka, is suspicious. In charge of the case, code name ""Laszlo,"" is a certain Weisler (Ulrich Mühe). And those thoroughly bugged and listened to day and night are Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a noted playwright, friend of the Chancellor, politically correct in the eyes of the regime, and his beloved girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), a famous actress. Behind this particular project are political higher-ups, sly and manipulative, jealous of each other's positions, kingpins of a system that in a few years will toss them out. This is a paranoid 1984 not far from the one Orwell imagined. When Weisler's men bug Dreyman's flat, the lady across the hall sees them. Weisler tells her if she speaks a word to anybody, her daughter will be thrown out of the university. One of the officials wants Christa-Maria. Now that she is vulnerable, on the examination table, so to speak, he can move in on her. It's only a matter of time before somebody will be begging for mercy.<br/><br/>Weisler is a rigid mole, but he has sensitive eyes. Like the Wall itself, his vision will crumble and we will see it happen. Weisler is a teacher in the police school, but Dreyman's life becomes his teacher. Dreyman is tall and glamorous. He sheds his middle class origins by never wearing a tie. He makes love to a beautiful woman who Weisler later declares to be a great artist. Weisler has to make do with flabby prostitutes on a tight schedule. Dreyman introduces Weisler to the humanizing value of music and poetry; he listens to a certain sonata, and he begins to read Brecht.<br/><br/>Weisler and Dreyman are both flawed heroes. The bad men are Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), Weisler's threatening supervisor, and the loathsome ""Culture"" minister with police powers Bruno Hempf (Thomas Tieme).<br/><br/>The question may arise in our minds: if Dreyman's so above reproach to the East Germans, how shall we admire him? But this film deals in nuances, moral ambiguities through which despair can turn to hope. The sonata was given to Dreyman for his birthday by a blacklisted friend and mentor, Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleimert), and Jerska's suicide leads the playwright to risk smuggling facts and an impassioned protest to the West. Dreyman does become admirable to us. But so does Weisler, the STASI agent, because by this time he wants to protect the objects of his surveillance, and to protect them he arranges to be the only man on the case. Dreyman evades exposure through Weisler's silent help. But there are casualties. Christa-Maris is catnip to the fat cats, and she's caught in the middle. Weisler covers his tracks, but his superior knows he's done something, and Weisler's sent to steam open letters in a cellar for the rest of his career. It's there that we see him get the extraordinary news four years later that the Wall is coming down.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others is free from the melodrama of pursuit and torture, but it knows the terror of the sudden house search, the second knock upon the door; of extortion, humiliation, and betrayal; the soul death of the creative person silenced, the calculated draining away of the will to act. It's a movie of dignity and hope too, though it speaks of long gray subterranean exile. The music Jerska gave Dreyman is called The Sonata of a Good Man. A chance remark by one of the fallen officials years later leads Dreyman to track down the facts (accessible now) and to write about them. When Weisler speaks the film's final lines, ""It's for me,"" they're among the most resonant in recent years. The Lives of Others is a little long in places  it threatens sometimes to morph into a mini-series  but its restraint and quietude make for an impressive cumulative effect, a sense of the prevailing grayness and rage totalitarianism generates. It's specific to the place and time, but gracefully universal, and it reveals the tall German with the aristocratic name, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, to be a world-class director."
"aiggpm","7","7","9","9 June 2015"," Truth is stranger than fiction
","Can you imagine a world where people are continuously spied on, where the police set up surveillance equipment in the attics, where even typewriters are registered and, in spite of this,a world accepting of refugees? I am not talking about science fiction. I am talking about real life, the real events that took place in East Germany before the Fall of the Wall.While I was watching 'The lives of others'I couldn't help comparing it to another film, 'Good Bye, Lenin'; both are widely applauded approaches to the recent history of East Germany. But I think one of them is definitely superior to the other; read on if you'd like to know which.Both films are German and were released more or less at the same time -around 2005- and they share factual accuracy and the atmosphere of that historical period, although the first one takes place mainly in the years before the Fall of the Wall and the second, in the years immediately after. Both films have a lot in common, such as an appealing theme, plausible dialogues, lots of moving scenes and convincing acting. In spite of sharing a common theme, they have different approaches, since 'The lives of others' shows the story of a playwright who is being spied on by 'the Party'. What is a cold relationship at the beginning of the story turns into sympathy, what seems love turns into treason, what should have been informing on somebody turns into respect and admiration. On the other hand, 'Good bye, Lenin!'is very innovative mainly because it has a large dose of comedy, which is remarkably powerful. When his mother suffers a heart attack and awakes from a coma seriously weakened, Alex, the main character has to pretend that nothing has changed, that East Berlin is the same as it was before the Fall of the Wall, because a great shock like that could cause her death, so there he goes doing the impossible to keep the 'status quo'. This situation leads to entertaining scenes and appealing dialogue. In addition, both films were recorded on set and on location -we can enjoy watching what Karl Marx Allee looked like almost thirty years ago.However, although both films portray our recent history very convincingly, I strongly recommend 'Good bye, Lenin!'because it is funny, moving and grabs your attention from the very first moment. And it can also make you think!"
"RJBurke1942","10","7","9","21 March 2008"," A defining moment for a good man in the midst of corruption.
","While the credits begin to roll, and as Captain Wiesler's (Ulrich Müle) face - transformed by muted joy - fades to black, I pondered, for a long time, the sheer brilliance of this finely crafted narrative from an equally brilliant first-time writer/producer/director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.<br/><br/>This film is positive proof that, for the most part, it is the story that makes or breaks. That's not to say this film is without flaw; but, I'll come to that below.<br/><br/>Fade in starts in 1984 - a nicely ironic touch, I thought, given that the setting is the police state of the GDR  East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down. Wiesler is employed as an interrogator with the East German State Police, or Stasi. In the first few minutes, you witness his cold, calculated finesse in destroying a prisoner's claims of innocence. So also, you learn that Wielser is as cold as the state that produced him, perhaps colder than the concrete walls that house the hapless prisoners. Real joy is apparently beyond Wiesler's ken; his only smile is when he knows he's trapped his prisoner in a tissue of lies.<br/><br/>His superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), knowing Wiesler's expertise, gives him a new task: dig up some dirt on one of the state's favorite sons  Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright and novelist of international repute who still manages to toe most of the Party line. Or does he?<br/><br/>Grubitz, however, has a hidden agenda: he wants damaging evidence against Dreyman because his superior, the lecherous Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) lusts after Dreyman's girl friend, Christa-Maria (Martina Gedek), a well-known and acclaimed stage actress. Wiesler, initially unaware of that tangle, jumps at the chance because he knows such a high-profile case will help his career along. Or so he thinks...<br/><br/>Hence, Dreyman's apartment is bugged and then monitored by Wiesler and his assistant, Udo (Charly Hübner), from a hidden loft at the top of the apartment block; and so 24/7, they begin to listen to the everyday lives of others. And, in doing so, something happens to Wiesler: he becomes interested, curious, inquiring, concerned and finally involved directly. Thus, his transformation from a cold automaton under state socialism into an engaged and sympathetic human being begins...and is, I think, also a metaphor for the transformation of the GDR later, when the Wall comes down.<br/><br/>These are the times that I wish I knew German better. The sub-titles, however, are very good. Hence, don't be deterred: this is an unhurried story that is told with a minimum of words with the camera in medium close-up and close-up for much of the time, thus allowing the actors to let their emotions say what words often cannot.<br/><br/>The plot itself is completely linear, each scene naturally following, so there is little chance of confusion for the viewer. Hence, when the tension comes, you're ready for it; when an ironic twist occurs  and there are many - you immediately know why, and either smile, cry or cringe; when tragedy strikes, you almost know it was going to happen anyway. But, it is at the end, when Dreyman and Wiesler both realize, at different times, the common thread that binds them irrevocably, that the full impact of the title hits: when you come to know the lives of others, you come to know yourself for who and what you are. So only the hardest of hearts will turn away from the thrill, the sheer joy, which lights up Wiesler's face as the final scene fades to black. That ironically beautiful ending, I'm sure, will be much discussed, debated and admired for years, if not generations, to come.<br/><br/>As Wiesler, Ulrich Müle, with a striking resemblance to Anthony Hopkins, is simply outstanding; his performance is flawless. This is his movie, no question, despite the quality of the rest of the cast. Equally, the cinematography, direction and editing are first class. Moreover, it's quite obvious also that the production was not expensive, attesting to the fact you don't need a lot of money to craft a brilliant story and film. In that regard, the Cohen brothers' first film, Blood Simple (1984) comes to mind as a (lesser) comparison.<br/><br/>And the flaw? Perhaps not so much a flaw as two narrative quirks: why was it relatively easy, in the Dreyman case, for Wiesler to throw off years of loyalty to the party and the state? Perhaps it was just the straw that broke the camel's back? And, while listening to others' lives, why does Wiesler go to the trouble of typing up a concurrent report summary instead of using tapes to record all the conversations and do the typing later? It seemed such a backward step, operationally, because he was so used to recording his interrogations of prisoners. I have some ideas, but I'll leave you to sort out your own.<br/><br/>Some may complain about the length (137 min); others may yawn at what they consider to be unnecessary scenes. In my opinion, however, there's not a wasted shot, frame or scene: this is filming and story telling at its best, and deservedly won the Academy Award 2007 for Best Foreign Film.<br/><br/>As a final point, this story is  perhaps unintentionally - also an obvious and timely warning about the excesses that any state, regardless of politics, can initiate and maintain in the name of national security."

","The Lives of Others,Das Leben der Anderen in German,is a dramatic feature that marks the directorial debut Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.It is about the monitoring of the cultural scene of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi,the East Germany's secret police.The movie stars Ulrich Mühe as Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler;Ulrich Tukur as his boss Anton Grubitz; Sebastian Koch as the playwright Georg Dreyman; and Martina Gedeck as Dreyman's lover as well as a prominent East German actress,Christa-Maria Sieland.It is an Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film in 2006.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others has its time setting in 1984.Capt. Gerd Wiesler is an agent of the Stasi,the East German Secret Police. Weisler carefully and dispassionately investigates people who might be deemed some sort of threat to the state. Shortly after Weisler's former classmate, Lt. Col. Grubitz, invites him to a theatrical piece by celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman, Minister Bruno Hempf informs Weisler that he suspects Dreyman of political dissidence, and wonders if this renowned patriot is all that he seems to be. As it turns out, Hempf has something of an ulterior motive for trying to pin something on Dreyman: a deep- seated infatuation with Christa-Maria Sieland, Dreyman's girlfriend. Nevertheless, Grubitz, who is anxious to further his career, appoints Weisler to spy on the gentleman with his help. Weisler plants listening devices in Dreyman's apartment and begins shadowing the writer. As Weisler monitors Dreyman's daily life, however, he discovers the writer is one of the few East Germans who genuinely believes in his leaders. This changes over time, however, as Dreyman discovers that Christa-Maria is being blackmailed into a sexual relationship with Hempf, and one of Dreyman's friends, stage director Albert Jerska, is driven to suicide after himself being blackballed by the government. Dreyman's loyalty thus shifts away from the East German government, and he anonymously posts an anti-establishment piece in a major newspaper which rouses the fury of government officials. Meanwhile, Weisler becomes deeply emotionally drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Sieland, and becomes something of an anti-establishment figure himself, embracing freedom of thought and expression. <br/><br/>The Lives of Others is the best German movie I have ever seen.It is a spy film like no other since it does not cater to car chases and action scenes but rather it focuses on character of the people in the story and character development.It is a a powerful but quiet film, constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires but nevertheless,it is not short on suspense and tension that makes it truly one engaging and absorbing film.Inspite of its political themes and implications,I still find the movie more about humanity rather than the ideologies and anti- establishment beliefs presented in it.Added to the great qualities of the film,the cast delivers in their great performance.<br/><br/>Overall,The Lives of Others is one unforgettable movie about the past history when Germany was divided into two nations with the East German people in particular."

","I remember when this came out it got quite a lot of critical acclaim. Of course it never made it to a cinema near me and so when it came up in the TV listings it became a 'must see' for me. I'm really glad I saw it, it's somewhat different to what I was expecting (in a good way). I know there are a few out there that are afraid of subtitles, so I should tell you that yes, it's in German with subtitles. For me, this isn't a problem, but with a long film (as this is), I find I sometimes have to take a break to rest the brain for a few minutes. I found it to be a really engaging drama that has some truly powerful scenes and some great performances. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.<br/><br/>It is East Germany in 1984, five years before the Berlin wall would fall. The East German people are constantly watched by the secret police, The Stasi. Anyone deemed to have strayed from the party line was arrested and interrogated. They could even end up in jail. When playwright, Georg Dreyman comes under the spotlight of the Stasi, at the behest of party official, Minister Bruno Hempf, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is assigned the case. Dreyman's apartment is bugged and Wiesler begins to listen to the comings and goings in the flat. Dreyman lives with his girlfriend, actress, Christa-Maria Sieland, who has a big part to play in the events that unfold. As time goes by, Wiesler begins to empathise with those he's listening to. He realises that not everything has to be reported, to the extent that he even scales down the operation so he alone reports on the couple. He uses this position to protect them when Dreyman begins to do things the party really wouldn't like. I will leave my summary here so as not to be subjected to a 48 hour interrogation by them Spoiler Police.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film, although I did find the surroundings very stark, but then again, I guess that's just realism. Great performances all round, particularly from Ulrich Mühe who played the rather serious Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler with great dignity. I thought Sebastian Koch as Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as Christa-Maria Sieland were both superb. Ulrich Tukur did a good job as Wiesler's boss, Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz, as did Thomas Thieme as the loathsome Minister Bruno Hempf.<br/><br/>I was surprised how much emotion was brought out both in, and by, this film. In the end it becomes a very heart-warming story. The beginning, on the other hand, I found really hard to follow, but once it settled down it was much easier. It has a slow, deliberate pace, but I didn't find it a chore to watch. I did find it was a little long though, but the extra scenes at the end are a real pay-off. So, if you're not scared of subtitles, and you can spare 137 minutes, then this one comes highly RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.5/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 93,806 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 93/100 (based on 150 reviews counted when this review was written)."

That state is long gone, as are the Stasi, yet their existence still chills and fascinates.<br/><br/>Step forward Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck with this drama of Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch), an East German playwright put under the surveillance of a superkeen Stasi officer, partly at the behest of a government minister who covets Dreymann's actress girlfriend (Martina Gedeck) and who would be grateful if the playwright were got out of the way to give him a clear run at the woman. Unfortunately for the libidinous minister, however, things do not quite go according to his plan.<br/><br/>This film's strengths are many - plausible story, subtle and appropriate music, suitably drab sets and camera-work  but it is the performances that really captivate. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are excellent, but Ulrich Mühe is simply flawless. We watch as his character, Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, makes the transition from unquestioning zealot to sympathetic collaborator who realizes at last that the system he has believed in all his life crushes those who do not fit in with it. It crushes him too, eventually, but in a noble cause that leads to a worthy end and an unexpectedly touching conclusion.<br/><br/>I am lucky enough to have sufficient grasp of German to watch this in the original, but, even if you can't, this one will grip you from start to finish.

","The Lives Of Others is, more or less, writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut and as such it is more than impressive. It speaks volumes that his cast, all well-established actors in Germany, agreed to work for a fifth of what they could normally expect to be paid. (It is, though, rather baffling that after the content and treatment of The Lives, von Donnersmarck's next project was the thoroughly entertaining but essentially super-lightweight The Tourist.) Others have criticised The Lives for giving a narrow portrayal of life in the former German Democratic Republic (always referred to in the Cold War years by the West Germans as 'die sogenannte DDR'), but that is a little unfair in that von D's film doesn't pretend but to give an insight into the lives of a very specific section of DDR society, the 'intellectual'. (Actually, my quote marks are superfluous as the Germans do, as a rule, take the life of the mind a damn sight more seriously than we Anglo-Saxons, although at times, to my tastes, a tad too seriously. But be that as it may.)<br/><br/>The Lives takes place in the declining years of the DDR when, as usual, the tendency to corruption was absolute and, for example, a powerful party functionary and minister of culture can arbitrarily ruin the professional life of a well-known actress because he is piqued that she start an affair with him. Having raped her in his official limousine (with his ubiquitous driver still sitting in the front) didn't win him any brownie points, that's for sure. It is his lust for the actress which sets in trail the surveillance of her partner, a tame playwright and writer who despite the exhortations of his more radical friends to take a stand, has managed to continue to bask in the goodwill of the party without actually selling out. The minister of culture instructs his ambitious contact in the secret police to dig whatever dirt he can on the playwright in order to discredit him and smooth his path into the actress's favours. The contact, in turn, instructs an underling and nominal friend in the Stasi to bug the playwright's flat and keep him under surveillance. As that underling, in time, gets to hear more and more details of his target's life, he comes to realise what a nasty set up his socialist state and its masters have become. Finally, when he comes across exactly they kind of dirt he is tasked to find – the playwright has written an article for a West German news magazine about the soaring suicide rate in this particular workers' paradise – he decides not to report it and instead falsifies the records he keeps of his surveillance.<br/><br/>I don't usually give a try to précis a plot, but I have done so here because it is a fascinating one which could have played out in any authoritarian state anywhere in the world and von Donnersmarck's German version is outstanding in its portrayal of how utterly intrusive the state apparatus was in everyone's life. But it has one small, but crucial flaw: its description of how the once proudly patriotic Stasi operative, who even lectures on interrogation techniques, slowly loses the faith is unconvincing. It happens to quickly. He is shown to be a lonely man with no outside interests, an unmarried man who hires prostitutes more for their company than for sexual gratification and who lives in a comfortable, though sparse and soulless flat in a soulless tower block. If anything the man as portrayed might be expected to become more rather than less zealous as a crude ploy to give his life the semblance of meaning.<br/><br/>On paper it sounds fine, but the man's conversation into a 'good man' (ein guter Mensch) simply does not convince in von Donnersmarck's film. Such a radical change – from enthusiastic Stasi officer into more or less a traitor in the eyes of his colleagues – is so fundamental that it would have been a far more gradual process and taken years to come about. This is not how we see it in the film: apparently from one day to the next his patriotism goes AWOL, and his subsequent anti-state actions – hiding the typewriter on which the playwright wrote his contentious article and which could identify him - are simply logical consequences of that change of heart.<br/><br/>I am now in danger of damning with faint praise, and I don't mean to do that. But for apart from what I regard as a flaw The Lives is excellent, not only as a film but as a production made on a comparative shoestring, and it deserves all the awards it garnered. If somehow it comes your way, take time to see it."

","I can honestly say, this is one of the finest examples of European film. The story is so dark and heart-breaking.

You will not call it your favourite, discuss it with your friends, or even watch it regularly. You will however be filled with the harrowing knowledge it gives to you. The awful state of affairs in GDR in the 1980s. It will rock your soul. Your very conscience. You will be gripped, unable to look away, and yet desperate to go back to the ignorance of our sheltered lives, after all, isn't it bliss?<br/><br/>The story follows the surveillance of a playwright and his girlfriend in 1985 in Eastern Germany, and how the Captain in charge of the operation becomes intoxicated by their lives, and as such, begins to cover up the very acts he is meant to report. It eventually ends with him preventing the playwright's arrest by hiding the evidence that would have him convicted. The evidence in question a type writer that wrote an article that uncovered the policy in Eastern Germany of no longer recording suicides. The information on where this typewriter was hidden came from the girlfriend of the playwright. She kills herself, overcome by guilt, only for the captain to have already removed the evidence. The ending of the film, several years later sees the Playwright review the files on the surveillance operation on him in a united Germany and he discovers the work of the Captain who had in many ways help conceal the evidence. He finds out who he is and tracks him down. He sees him but he does not approach him. We then see the Captain who is now a postman of some kind walk past a book shop with the playwright's photograph and novel in the window. He goes in and opens a copy to see that is devoted to him. His code name. He buys a copy and the cashier asks him if he'd like it gift- wrapped. He replies: ""No, it's for me.""<br/><br/>It is the most beautiful ending to a film I have ever seen."

","The first scene is amazing : you're watching a STASI class, where an interrogatory is meticulously analyze and deconstructed with a scientific method : if the person calms down after a while, she's lying, if she tells the exact same story twice, she's guilty... After this introduction to the method, we're about to watch its application. But unfortunately, watching the live of the others without interfering their live isn't that easy. And the cold Stasi agent will share empathy for his future victims.<br/><br/>The way the inhuman agent (greatly plays by Ulrich Mühe) slowly becomes an anonymous hero ( he'll stay a serial number to the end, hidden in the shadows of more brightly people) to the contact of passion, love and art (music, theater and literature), symbolized by the couple he's suppose to watch, is very convincing and greatly develops. The direction of the movie is sober and matured, the actor are all good, and the script is clever enough to give an impression of realism to the all story. <br/><br/>For all this ""objectiv"" reasons, this movie is definitely a good movie, and you leave the theater with the impression of having watch a serious piece of art of quality. But still, you wondering... If it was so good, why haven't you really been moved by the story, why this indifference toward the characters, why have you watch it with so little passion ? Of course, the theme, the period and the atmosphere of the film appeals sobriety, it's voluntary made that way. Right, but still, you can't help having the impression that something is missing to this movie, that this lack of passion doesn't necessarily have to move from the characters to the spectators, that the description of a cold and sad age doesn't have to be manufactured that way. <br/><br/>In fact, it's madness this film lacks : it's missing a surprising event that wakes the spectator from the monotony of a ""interesting"" feature. Of course, this could have broke the harmony and unity of the movie, and make another ""Black Book"" instead of a so ""well done"" piece of art, but at least, you wouldn't have the impression of watching a nearly scholar movie, made by a good student, who gives you everything you're waiting for in a German movie about the STASI setting in 1984, and doesn't really leave any room to surprise."

","Regular readers of my comments know I go on and on about noir and folding. When I see these narrative techniques used, I often remark that the technique is wasted, because the film has no heft once it has charmed us into investing in it.<br/><br/>Not so here. The thing we get from this is simple, the value of passion in art. We get it viscerally and it matters. The basic device is as usual, commitment to art as a commitment to a lover. We also get the common technique of mapping personal challenge into political challenge because you can ""show"" it.<br/><br/>The folding here is complex. Our watcher in the story is literally a watcher. We are getting a film written by the filmmaker that features a play and ultimately a book by the main character. The watcher and writer have other watchers, and indeed the woman has other attention concerning performance. We have writing or performing (in life, in sex, piano, play...) at every fold. Its very tight in its construction and effective at what it sets out to do. <br/><br/>Quite apart from that, its timeliness in the US is apt. The subtitles I saw translated the spies as ""National Security Agency,"" which as every American now knows performs very similar surveillance on its citizens, also without controls, and also for political purpose.

"yris2002","9","6","8","5 December 2009"," Terrific screenplay and solid performances for a powerfully gripping drama
","It is the second time I have seen this movie. When I first saw it I remember feeling upset by the idea that just a little more than 20 years ago, in the heart of a civilized and enlightened Europe, there dominated such cultural repression and such terroristic means of questioning. Not that history of the former DDR was unknown to me, but probably because undeveloped at school, or probably because a little disregarded also by cinematography, it was rather upsetting. On a second watching, having assimilated the strong impact of the first one, I could better analyze the quality of the movie from a cinematographic point of view, and really appreciate it. It has a solid structure which makes every shot perfectly match with the whole, and contributes to an overall clear, lucid and perfectly built drama. The story proceeds with a quick pace, each scene is the preparation for the next one, everything is under control and follows a well marked and gripping path. The cast is simply outstanding: the actress playing Christa Maria is truly convincing in showing her deep inner laceration between her love for the stage and her love for Georg, the handsome and attractive dramatist, who knows where the right side lies, but finds it hard to assert it explicitly. But who leaves the most emotionally powerful mark is Ulrich Muhe interpreting Wiesler: he stirs thought and emotion, he is so dramatically contained, as his character requires, but, in a single hint at a smile (whe he reads Brecht's poems), conveys such a desperate yearning for true life, I think an Oscar deserving interpretation. In the end, a movie I would absolutely advise: it is intelligently thought-provoking, intellectually honest, and solidly built: a high-level piece of cinema. Really worth seeing."

A powerful story of tragedy and triumph, of greed and grace, of love and deception. It is a story about the cost of sacrifice and the cost of compromise. <br/><br/>The screenplay is masterfully written and and the story carefully directed. So good is the crafting and telling of the story that the movie transcends borders - any audience can appreciate it. The art direction was very well balanced and added to the emotions the story brings out. Its only obvious weakness in my opinion were the few times it lacked continuity causing the editing of some sequences to be a bit awkward. <br/><br/>For those who believe that government knows best and the populace needs the government to care for its needs - they need to see this movie.

"bobbobwhite","9","6","8","12 March 2007"," Probably the best film of 2006
","Even though The Departed may be judged by most to be more powerful and shocking, this film shocks but it also saddens, and then encourages the heart in a unique way that senses-bludgeoning films like The Departed cannot...in the inexorable and certain life-draining way that only stories detailing the harsh realities of a life without hope can do, and then which show a complete about face and tell the resulting story of total transformation and its effects on the same people. Always difficult to do, but was done with brilliance in this film.<br/><br/>Most of this film was about people's unhappy lives without hope under Socialism, but then come the transformations, individual and national, that change everything. This film develops the story of dreary but threatening communist ""hope oppression"" better than any I can remember since the '50's film, ""1984"". Without hope to encourage us, what else is there to the real value of life? <br/><br/>The very soulful and talented Urich Muhe(his features hint of Kevin Spacey) plays the role of a hardened national police captain who is the central screw on which the story turns, a totally committed socialist party cop who undergoes a complete, but not overtly joyful, change of heart that works to alter forever the fortunes of the story's foil, a writer/playwright of increasingly ""questionable"" political views who, as a result, becomes a central target of the Stasi, the national security police that was shown to be ubiquitous and all-powerful, and every bit as formidable and scary as the outrageously inhuman ""Big Brother"" that terrified citizens in ""1984"".<br/><br/>Early on, Muhe played the police captain as a Jack Webb/Joe Friday-type cop.....humorless, cold, stiff and ruthlessly committed to doing the best but also the meanest job he could do in a mean business to root out any and all political dissenters. Muhe's role interpretation in his gradual but complete transformation to the other side personally and politically was nothing less than acting brilliance, and probably the best acting of the year in any film. Don't miss it, as you will be missing rare acting greatness if you do, and at least the equal to the brilliance of Massimo Triosi in Il Postino.<br/><br/>Also, along with the greatest movie-ending lines in history, the very last line in this film summed up everything that happened before in the best and fewest words possible, and it will surely move you greatly, not only from immense sadness and pity for what happened to the disgraced former cop but also from great hope and gratitude for the people in this world who finally see the true light as did Muhe's transformed police captain, and then put it to work bettering the world even though the personal cost may be great. An heroic act of course, but even more, one worthy of emulation by all of us.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" was so emotionally powerful throughout but nearly overwhelming at the end, as it showed so well one of the greatest life-lessons that can be learned by anyone, and one never to be forgotten....some of your good deeds will be rewarded in some way.<br/><br/>(added 1/23/08: one of the best movies and lead role acting in decades. Urich Muhe died recently, and what a tragic loss of talent and person. His death makes me also sadly grieve the similar fates of the magnificent Massimo Triosi of Il Postino, and the creative genius Adrienne Shelley of Waitress....both also died much too young right after their highly acclaimed triumphs in those films.)"
"BerlinGuy","9","19","33","9 August 2006"," not such a bad film, after all
","so I finally got to see the film everyone has been talking about. I have also seen the talk show in which the director gets into an argument with East-German actor Henry Hübchen. I must admit the director comes across as arrogant bordering on annoying. He is obviously a wunderkind or something but he is actually such a smart-ass that I can't imagine a character less likable. Watching his discussion with Hübchen made me want to boycott the film (even though I adore the actors in it, Martina Gedeck and Ulrich Mühe)<br/><br/>I am glad I didn't. It may not be historically accurate. I am from East Germany but I am too young to know. Yet, most people say the GDR as portrayed in the film was not the GDR of the 1980s but rather the (Stalinist) GDR of the 1950s. In the 1980s, most actors, singers, the famous people were able to extort the GDR government as they could just go west and embarrass the officials. If the writer/actress couple were really as famous as the film suggests, in 1984, the GDR officials would have given them anything they wanted. (the pivotal point was 1976 when dissident Wolf Biermann was denaturalized)<br/><br/>In that respect, I understand Hübchen's criticism. He said he lived in the period and doesn't agree with the way it was portrayed. He fears that the will now stand testimony to the era and people may well think that this is the way it was. His grandson asked him why he didn't do anything about it, how he could live in a system like this etc. I suppose he is afraid Donnersmark steals his biography, in a way.<br/><br/>However, it is still a work of fiction and people who watch a film should know. It is a good film, if overly dramatic, a little obvious, and Hollywood-IA. It has some great moments, actually. Mühe is fantastic as the man in grey.<br/><br/>So, it's definitely worth checking out. I have a feeling it may get more appreciation abroad than in Germany. It was obviously produced with the foreign (esp American) audiences in mind. And I think it may translate pretty well into foreign territories as it gets enthusiastic notices from critics abroad.<br/><br/>My favourite German film this year is still Sommer vorm Balkon, yet it appears foreigners don't get the subtle and sweet Berlin humour."

","This movie comes along with many headlines claiming that there is now finally a realistic portrait of the G.D.R. (i.e., the former socialistic eastern part of Germany). Actually, it tells us much more about the present situation in Germany, the lack of critical awareness and anticipatory obedience.<br/><br/>The plot is quickly told. The East German minister for culture (Thomas Thieme) gets randy at a popular actress (Martina Gedeck, playing one of these notorious ""beautiful faces of communism""), and orders the Stasi (East German Secret Service) to observe, and eventually eliminate, her lover, a conformist playwright (Sebastian Koch). Chain of command goes down to the Stasi captain (Ulrich Muehe, star of the movie), who initially keeps his duty with his approved loyalty, but questions his activities in the course of time and during this distant confrontation with his victim. Finally, of course, he becomes a ""good man"".<br/><br/>Probably you don't need to know East Germany to see how ridiculous this is. To name a few points, for the Nomenklatura of the communist party, political power was more than a perfect substitute for sex, to an extend that they were closely controlling that only puritanic characters would enter the inner circles, or getting expelled otherwise (e.g. Konrad Naumann). As often mentioned, a minister for culture hadn't the power to command the Stasi for such tasks. Moreover, East Germany was anxiously to keep the opportunistic (and even the semi-opportunistic) intellectuals in good mood, actually making this land a kind of paradise for a certain type of artists. Of course, nobody who suffered from a tough Stasi watchdog would believe the wonderful change of mind pictured here.<br/><br/>The movie has some good points. First, the actors are very good, especially brilliant (as usual) Mr. Muehe. Secondly, it is not on of these light-hearted comedies painting the G.D.R. with nostalgic colours (though it inherits some of their cheap jokes, like the running gags about the East German furniture). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this second point doesn't make the movie more realistic. The G.D.R. WAS a non-democratic state, with a huge load of injustice and cruelty, but it didn't work this way (though it is obvious that the director got some advice for the technical details of surveillance, but that's not the point). Actually, the director (who has no experience with the GDR society, which was claimed to be a merit by the German media) perfectly reflects how an average West-German artist (due to his natural limitations in experience) imagines the past of the East. No wonder this movie is a success. First of all, the conflict in the G.D.R. was about the society, not about sex. This is of course hard to imagine for modern pop-artists, whose only contact with reality is sex, and therefore the only propelling force. Secondly, a realistic movie about the G.D.R. should NOT play in East Berlin. It was the city of the mandarins of the socialistic society, life was fair and easy compared with the rest of the land. There were good reasons why the revolution in 1989 didn't start there. Thirdly, one should not take over the stories of some pseudo-dissidents who invented fashionable curricula to get a good start in the other part of Germany. These stories were simply manufactured to flatter the new rulers and get easy money. Unfortunately, this movie does perfectly the same (for business details, it would also be instructive to analyze how helpful an aristocratic title in the neo-feudalistic German society is to get the money for the production and friendly media). <br/><br/>What is also painfully lacking, is a feeling for today's morals of the story. Indeed, a similar surveillance could happen nowadays in the course of ""anti-terrorism"" in many countries (again, the movie has nothing to do specifically with the G.D.R.). There is obviously some fear of the author's to show that many of the G.D.R. institutional criminals are now very successful in the ""new"" Germany. Do you want a really specific German Stasi story? Imagine a close friend of a high rank Stasi officer, who founded a ""democratic"" party in 1989 to infiltrate the movement and/or get along with the new times, and follow her way through many surprising turns and strange political miracles till she finally ends as the head of the ""new"" Germany."

","Generally, I thought this was a great movie, very well done, very suspenseful. The ending was a great bit of closure - a nice touch where Georg could let Wiesler know that he knew what Wiesler had done for him. I would have liked Georg and Wiesler to have a conversation, but maybe that would have been too much of a Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>My main negative about the movie is that I didn't understand why Wiesler was so affected by the lives of Georg and Christa-Maria. Clearly his life was empty, but he was an experienced agent and had spied on many people, which probably included artists. I didn't see why he would feel such sympathy for these two to the point of putting himself at risk. But if you just take his feelings and reasons for what they are, the film works very well.<br/><br/>I saw von Donnersmarck interviewed (in English) and was surprised at his American accent - evidently he lived in New York for part of his childhood. I recently saw ""Downfall"" (Untergang) and ""Head-On"" (Gegen Die Wand), which were also excellent movies. I'm glad to see that German films are achieving international recognition."
"Philby-3","9","9","14","31 March 2007"," Stasi a lesson to us all
","It has been suggested that the story of Hauptmann Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a senior, dedicated and zealous Stasi East German (DDR) secret police officer who starts to empathise with the subjects of his investigation is rather improbable, but to me it rings true emotionally.<br/><br/>His subjects are Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright currently in party favour, and his actress lover Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck). Sooner or later, an inhabitant of the chill world of secret policing with no private life to speak of sent to investigate ""artists"" is going to feel the warmth and charm of the milieu he is spying on, especially where, as here, he soon realises that his superiors' motives for the investigation are corrupt.<br/><br/>Apologists for the Stasi (and given it employed 100,000 and had at least 200,000 informers these are numerous) say the DDR was a system that ran according to laws which were designed to protect society, but as is inevitable in totalitarian regimes the laws were perverted by those in charge to serve their own ends. Thus loathsome culture minister Hempf wants to get something on Dreyman so he can have the lovely Christa Maria all to himself, and Wiesler's slimy boss Grubitz is only too happy to oblige.<br/><br/>Wiesler's conversion from dedicated servant of the regime to furtive dissident is an amazing process to watch, and Ulrich Muhe, who happens to be an ""ossi"" (former DDR resident), makes it very plausible. Despite tragedy, the movie has a surprisingly upbeat ending. The complacent Hempf believes people don't change but this does not mean they are entirely predictable.<br/><br/>We see a fair amount of the Stasi at work. The rank and file are not portrayed as monsters, or automatons, just ordinary workers prepared to crack jokes about their masters at work. Most of what they do is minor harassment directed towards encouraging conformity. It is not hard to break the rules in a society where you need permission to subscribe to a foreign newspaper. It is an interesting irony that one of the catalysts of Wiesler's silent rebellion is the work of Bertold Brecht, at one time an enthusiastic supporter of the DDR.<br/><br/>Whatever you think of its politics, this is a very fine film, with not a single one of its 137 minutes wasted. It is certainly an antidote to the ""ossie"" nostalgia said to possess some residents of the former DDR and wonderfully satirised in ""Good-Bye Lenin"". But it also asks all of us how would we behave in similar circumstances. If it might be to your individual advantage (and to the disadvantage of your enemy) would you do it? The Stasi had even otherwise loving couples informing on each other. We can only hope that, despite our own overzealous secret policemen who are doing their best to undermine our civil liberties in the name of anti-terrorism, we never get to such depths in this country. I do hope Phil Ruddock (our Attorney-General) gets to see this movie."

The problem is, this film isn't a masterpiece.

There is no real feeling of danger, the characters seem unreal, and consequently we don't care what happens to them.

I'm generally wary of hype but it's totally justified in this case. So much care has gone into the writing, stylisation, visuals, casting, acting, direction, editing, sound. I think they really wanted to tell this story right. And they succeeded.<br/><br/>Set in East Germany in the mid 1980s, you get a fly-on-the-wall look at how the Stasi(secret police) operated, and the ubiquitous menace it sowed into people's every day lives. Moreover you get an insight into the precarious plight of the artist living under such a regime, i.e. either he sells out and produces safe art that doesn't challenge those in power, or is true to himself but risks surveillance, interrogation, an end to his career or worse.<br/><br/>The central story is of a playwright who is in good standing with the government at the beginning of the film but falls foul of a corrupt government minister who takes a shine to his girlfriend. Ordering the Stasi to conduct full surveillance on the playwright's home, the minister then brutally pursues the girlfriend. The rest of the film follows the interplay between the watcher(a particularly expedient Stasi officer), his superior, the watchees, and the government minister.<br/><br/>Superbly well-acted all round. Just a well-rounded piece of work. So easy to watch. It really transports you to a different place and time. You get a feel for the spartan nature of that society, the apparent havens of normality within, but of course all ultimately at the mercy of the powers that be.<br/><br/>A beautifully crafted study of how fear and consequence influence art, the ugliness of corruption in a society where people have no power, and how divisions of good and evil aren't nearly as black and white as we would like to believe."

","West German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafted an engaging drama in The Lives Of Others, his first feature film. At the center of this film is the impressive performance by Ulrich Muhe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, an officer of the Stasi. Wiesler is an efficient and loyal employee who goes through changes he didn't expect. After listening in on Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), two fine artists whose lifestyle is different from his he begins to doubt his work. In addition to the excellent performances from the cast and Donnersmarck's effective direction the film is aided by Hagen Bogdanski's expert cinematography. Some reviewers stressed the feeling of paranoia in The Lives Of Others but my opinion is that instead the film amplifies the relationships that all people have every day. By picking these characters Donnersmarck stresses humanity. This approach leads to a satisfying emotional ending. While The Lives Of Others is a very good piece of filmmaking it's certainly not a history lesson. The German Democratic Republic was perhaps the state with the most surveillance in the Eastern Bloc but even there there were only a few Wieslers and personal or even erotic motifs played a somewhat subordinate role in the musty atmosphere of East German socialism. The film is not an accurate presentation of life in the Eastern Bloc, and it was intentionally made to look gray. Another factor is the film's Best Picture win at the 2006 Academy Awards, which by the way is a tentacle of American propaganda. The film that should have won was Pan's Labyrinth, but instead The Lives Of Others was picked for ideological reasons. Despite these obvious flaws and problems The Lives Of Others is still one of the best German films of recent years, and internationally it grossed an impressive $77 million."

The actors are brilliant. The script is perfect. The sets are historically correct and give you a good impression of how it felt to live in the DDR. Not really a ""feel good""-movie but a message to set the records straight about the DDR-regime and its StaSi-system.

","Before the Berlin Wall came down, the government was very interested in ""The Lives of Others,"" a brilliant 2006 German film directed and written by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.<br/><br/>The story concerns a dramatist, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and his actress-girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). As artists, they are revered by the party. In private, however, their politics are somewhat different, but they're careful to keep them quiet. The Minister of Culture isn't convinced of Dreyman's loyalty - in part because of his own interest in Christa, so he assigns an agent, Weisler (Ulrich Muhe), to spy on them. This entails wiring their apartment for sound, listening in 24/7, and providing reports to the Minister. Weisler becomes drawn into the lives of these two people and their friends, and therein lies the fascinating story.<br/><br/>Poignant, occasionally funny, scary, and thought-provoking, ""The Lives of Others"" is a fantastic film about the human soul in the face of politics, bureaucracy, fear, and desensitization. The director captures the tension-filled, drab atmosphere of East Berlin. I found the ending especially emotionally powerful.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful. Muhe is great as a colorless puppet of the state, and Gedeck and Koch are excellent as the theatrical couple.

","I'm amazed. After watching and enjoyed 'Goodbye Lenin!', I've waited for another German masterpiece. I can't say anything about 'Der Untergang' because I haven't seen it yet, but saying something about this movie, that's already another thing, that's possible: amazing. Just amazing. Such an excellent movie, and one of the most brilliant and excellent masterpieces I have seen in years. This automatically entered my top 10 of all time. This will please the most prolific and most exigent movie lovers plus the drama and history ones, I have no doubt.<br/><br/>First, what I really liked in this movie was how the reality is so well treated. The movie is cold blooded and shows with no disturbing how far went STASI before the fall of the Berlin wall. It just shows it and that's it, that's the reality. There's's no other ways to be told, it was like that. And this, I found it very interesting and I enjoyed a lot.<br/><br/>Then the performances. These actors aren't very known in the movie business (for me, if they are well known, then I apologize my ignorance), but still, they achieve to deliver performances so realistic and so powerful, that simply amazed me and I think they brought a lot of depth to the movie, specially this being a drama. It really improved the movie's seriousness. For me Ulrich Mühe was the golden star in this movie, and I am sad for his death, because he really achieved something here. May he rest in peace, forever.<br/><br/>Then the script. Excellent, no twists, and absolutely amazing as the writer managed to focus on a real theme, but also achieved to drop other themes, such as love and friendship, that in the end turned into back stabbing. And this opposition created by the director slash writer, was very, very interesting.<br/><br/>So, 'Das Lieben Der Anderen', is really one of the best movies made in the last years, and I am sure, that it is also one of the very best of all time (IMdB's Top 250, you bet it deserves being there). This movie really got a point, and it's to denounce how far the STASI went. Sure, there were more politic polices, but what they did, wasn't normal. I at least, don't think it was normal. I mean...where were privacy and liberty? - 10/10."

","Set mostly in the 1980s and during the cold war, Das Leben der Anderen tells of the world created by the Stasi (the internal army by which the Socialist Unity Party kept control of the German Democratic Republic, aka GDR) and how GDR citizens lived in a world of repression. A state security captain, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhn), is an expert in interrogating dissidents and is assigned the case of spying on a playwright called Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). It is for this reason (of being a playwright) that he is put under surveillance. As Weisler's investigation progresses he becomes unwittingly aware of his own limited existence and empathy for those he watches ensues, taking precedence over his obedience and loyalty to the Stasi  so much so that he begins to falsify documents and lie about events in Dreyman's life. Regarding the films treatment of the Stasi, Das Leben der Anderen has caused controversy upon its release, especially in Germany with people comparing the members of the Stasi to that of the Gestapo, 40 years previous. Recent German history is littered with examples of the Stasi's uncompromising approach  some of which are still coming to fruition. In brief the Stasi spied on, imprisoned, and ruined the lives of anyone it chose and in the immediate aftermath of the war there were a lot of deaths or ""liquidations"" of opponents. In later years the Stasi abandoned this approach in favour of psychological torture and exile. They would routinely brake into peoples flats, steal underwear (to be bottled as odour samples) for identification purposes and use psychotropic drugs on those under house arrest, this would mostly happen due to tip offs from fellow GDR citizens turned informers, as once an informer certain liberties would follow. Artists and those of a creative nature (writers, poets, journalist etc) were a favoured choice of the Stasi and their work was often either stifled, scrutinised, compromised or even destroyed  similarities with the manner in which Nazi's burned books are blatantly apparent; the film also makes plenty of references to books being a source of provocation. Because of all this GDR citizens lived in world of fear and paranoia, as individuals they were afraid and suspicious of all those they met. It was, without question, a totalitarian society.<br/><br/>Das Leben der Anderen is very low budget, but it is outstandingly written capturing the essence of people's feelings at the time  with some great lines being ironically delivered by a government minister, the greatest line in the film though has to be the last because of its emotional connotations. The direction and the cinematography capture a sombre and monotonous East Germany with its drab lighting and muted colours, perfectly illustrating the despondency of its citizens. Performances throughout the film are excellent, Gerd Weislers girlfriend Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) is a joy to watch, most notably the uncomfortable anxiety she displays during a scene in the back of a taxi cab manages to be felt by all those watching as does her expression of guilt and betrayal towards the end of the film. The greatest performance however comes from Ulrich Muhn. The opening scene in Das Leben der Anderen shows him lecturing some students on the art of integration; he plays them a cassette of one of his own interrogations. The man on the tape complains of being tired, to which a student declares that it is inhuman to deny him his sleep. Wielser scribbles a mark next to the students name before he retorts  this act alludes to the possibility that this individual will face some sort of punishment for his remark. Weisler continues teaching and, in accordance with the cassette, states that a guilty man will become quiet and reiterate his rehearsed lies, whilst an innocent man will shout and scream. This behaviour and this carefully constructed scene beautifully underpins the Stasi regime, it sets forth and establishes the type of character Weisler is, whilst allowing for the understanding that any deviation from this way of thinking results in you becoming an enemy.<br/><br/>Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding accomplishment because of its proficiency at utilising old-fashioned narratives and placing them into a malevolent world - that was once real. Unfortunately it tells of a story that did not occur (the director and his researchers underwent four years of research for the film and could not find one example of a Stasi man empathisising with dissidents or even suspected dissidents) and although accurate in many other areas the films core values are untrue and almost propagandarous. To assume that a man like Weisler could change his beliefs questions the very understandings of a totalitarian state, it ignores historical accuracy to feed cinema's desire to misrepresent and fabricate history for the purpose of entertainment and it is this that is simultaneously the films strength and its weakness. In a nutshell the film is about hope, it is a word that is mentioned a lot and it is something that propels the characters and narrative forward and it is how the story finally resolves itself - by pandering to this sense of hope. Despite its short comings, Das Leben der Anderen is one of the first films to look back at the GDR and not reminisce or gain humour from it (""Good Bye, Lenin!"", 2003) and it treats them with heavier hand than many other German films to date, but it also lets them off lightly. I am a strong believer in film as an art form and had the film been more truthful to itself then it would have been an incredible piece of art, but in sticking with recent trends laid out by current German film-makers (a common attribute of New German Cinema) the film has fused both art and entertainment thus leading to Das Leben der Anderen being just an incredible piece of entertainment."
"Terrell-4","10","4","5","6 February 2008"," A sad, thoughtful and redemptive film
","The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) is one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. It's sad, thoughtful and redemptive, and it deals with major themes. We're in East Germany a few years before the fall of the Berlin wall. The Stasi are everywhere, watching everyone and punishing in brutal or subtle ways anyone who might be even an implied threat to the government. Their greatest tool is the system of informers that reaches everywhere, people who may relay indiscretions to the Stasi because they believe in what they are doing, but more often are compromised into doing so. People are given terrible choices to either work with the Stasi as informers or see their careers or their children's futures destroyed. One-third of the East German population is kept under Stasi surveillance. Everyone, it seems, is being watched by someone. <br/><br/>Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is a playwright who has made his accommodations with the regime, has won awards and has learned not to go too far. The mere fact that he is seen as reliable makes him a subject of Stasi interest. That, and because his lover, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), is coveted by a powerful official who wants Dreyman ruined. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a dedicated, colorless Stasi officer, noted for his reliability and interrogation skills, is assigned the job of monitoring Dreyman. This means installing bugs in Dreyman's apartment where Dreyman lives with Sieland, setting up 24 hour monitoring, recording everything and preparing reports. Wiesler takes his share of listening in. Wiesler seems to have no purpose but his dedication to the ideals of the East German system, but even he can see the corruption of those ideals. He has no friends to speak of except his boss, who knows which way the wind can shift. Dreyman, on the other hand, is a handsome man of talent who loves Christa and who has seen a close friend and talented director banned from the theater for speaking too clearly. Dreyman gradually finds the conscience he had put on hold in order to be successful. Wiesler gradually finds himself, through listening in, drawn to an awareness of the compromises and corruption he knows has seeped into a system he once believed in. Even more subtly, he finds himself drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Christa-Maria. Slowly, cautiously and anonymously, Wiesler begins to protect Dreyman. All the while we are witness to the pervasive spying on people, the pettiness, the corruption of authority, the use of subtle threats to keep people in line, the almost comic meticulousness of the Stasi and their obsessive record keeping on everyone. The conclusion of the film brings us well past the fall of the Berlin wall, when the full evidence of Stasi spying and the corruption of so many to be informers became evident. We see what happened to both Dreyman and Wiesler. I found the ending to be very, very emotional. <br/><br/>This was director von Donnersmarck's first feature film. He also was the writer. The acting is just as good as the film, particularly Muhe, Koch and Gedeck. Muhe has perhaps the toughest job. He has to show us this dedicated functionary first relentlessly breaking a suspect through calm, psychological questioning, then gradually, gradually letting us see Wiesler's doubts and humanity as he listens into to the lives of Dreyman and Sieland. Muhe makes us aware of Wiesler's changing outlook no faster than Weisler becomes aware of them himself. It's a subtle, strong performance."

","I just finished watching a powerful German film which bagged the Best Foreign Film in the Oscars last year. I rarely use that description for a film: but the powerful aspect of ""The Lives of Others"" is its message of realistic optimism and compassion amidst the corruption and exploitation of human rights during the last few years of the Socialist Germany. If one is familiar with ""Goodbye, Lenin!""'s comic approach on the issue of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he will find the treatment of the story of the characters in ""The Lives of Others"" far more intense and frightening yet endearing as the secret agent in charge of spying on an artist and his lover becomes too involved in the couple's secret lives. Being a very vigilant servant of the System, Wiesler, the agent, knows that his risk of saving the artists who are attacking the GDR whom he has served for almost all his life is akin to throwing everything that matters to him. But why does he dare? The very answer to that is the gem that one can unfold upon getting involved in the lives of these characters.<br/><br/>The performances were incredibly harrowing yet as moving as a beautifully composed sonata. This masterpiece from the director Von Donnersmarck probably is the best European film of this decade so far. <br/><br/>There is a line at the latter part of the film which caught my attention... which probably is true for any country which underwent a major overhauling of its political system.

","This movie is quite simply one of the best, and one of the most moving, that I've seen in a year. When it won the Oscar for best foreign language film a couple of months back, I hadn't even heard of it, but some excellent reviews induced me to forsake the California spring sunshine for the cool darkness of the Santa Cruz Nickleodean on a Saturday afternoon, and it was well worth the sacrifice. It's astonishingly good. I can't recall the last time a film genuinely moved me close to tears. (Usually when I cry at a movie, it's out of boredom or sheer frustration at the utter banality and lack of imagination.) It is totally engrossing, but never so complex that the story is hard to follow (an occasional fault with spy stories.) Set in East Berlin in 1984, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, The Lives of Others examines the menacing control the state police, the Stasi, had over the lives of everyone in East Germany, especially artists, who might have been considered subversives.<br/><br/>Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and Christa (Martina Gedeck) are an attractive couple. He is one of the few East German playwrights who is produced in the East but retains enough credibility to be read in the West. He treads a fine line with work which keeps him out of trouble with the Stasi, while still socializing with writers who are banned. She is an actress who is lusted after by the culture minister, an unpleasant individual who abuses his power by trying to have dirt dragged up on Dreyman, so he can move in on Christa. Stasi captain Wiesler (marvelous Ulrich Muhe) is set to spy on Dreyman and Christa, bugging their apartment, and reporting on their lives, trying to find something incriminating. All day he sits in the loft over their building, listening, but as their lives unfold he gets absorbed in their humanity and starts to doubt the system of which he is such a vital part. His own life is lonely; committed to the state which has nurtured him, he lacks warm, affectionate human contact but is at least still capable of recognizing it in others, and perhaps envying it. And when Dreyman's close friend, a fellow playwright, commits suicide out of despair at the hopelessness of life in the East, Dreyman can no longer maintain his distance, and he becomes involved in the political opposition, with tragic consequences for him and Christa, but surprising consequences for Wiesler.<br/><br/>One of the things that is intriguing about a movie like this, at least to me, is all the little details of the spy's techniques, the sheer efficiency with which the apartment is completely bugged in a few minutes, for example. Or the classroom full of eager students learning interrogation methods. Very well illustrated too, is the air of menace which kept a population subdued with very little obvious physical violence. I've always been a sucker for spy stories, anything by John Le Carre, Graham Greene or the recent movie Breach, etc. The Lives of Others is right up there with the best stories. Congratulations to all concerned on the Oscar. Very well deserved."

","Remember Total Recall? The sci-fi movie about people who get memory implants? Looks like that just happened to the viewers of The Lives of Others (LOO) , who are now convinced they know all about the GDR.  It was always cloudy.  Everybody wore either a uniform or tasteful clothes in muted shades of gray, blue, or brown.  The streets were empty.  Only two kinds of people lived theredissident artists and police spies.  There was a major shortage of women.  Everyone spoke in a flat, lifeless way (flat and lifeless--in Berlin??).  Nobody ever wore red or put on ugly flowered polyester shirts, nor did they raise kids, go to bars, shop for cold cuts, play miniature golf, or listen to Elvis Presley.<br/><br/>Of course, as soon as you think about this, you realize that the movie is not about a real country at all, but about one of those abstract, generic totalitarian dystopias1984 (Winston and Julia ratting on each other), Minority Report, bits of Star Wars (the slimy toad-monster molesting Princess Leah) and above all, THX 1138, with gray hairless people grimly marching along gray sunless corridors while security forces keep flawless records on everybody. In other words, LOO creates a montage of spliced, recycled images from sci-fi movies to implant a generic image of ""the totalitarian state"" in our minds as our ""memory"" of the GDR.<br/><br/>If we accused the director of playing games with these images, he would probably respond disingenuously that he made a movie about a state of mind and not a historical documentary. Funny though how many people (to judge from the reviews) believe that now they know something about the GDR. Well, what's wrong with a false memory, as long as it's anti-communist?<br/><br/>And on the subject of falsehoods, take a look at a little sleight of hand the director tries to pull:: 1) The protagonist is understandably unhappy about the suicide of his friend. 2) The GDR did stop publishing suicide statistics (actually even earlier than 1977, as is discussed in a 1972 Radio Free Europe research report that you can see online). 3) Before the GDR stopped publishing the figures, it had a very high rate, probably the second highest in Europe after Hungary. So far, so good, but now keep your eyes open as the rabbit is pulled out of the hat! So it logically follows that the communist regime caused the high suicide rate-- right? Wait a minute! This conclusion is a logical non sequitur and a misrepresentation of historical facts. The regions comprising the GDR (especially Saxony, Prussia, and Mecklenburg, with Brandenburg not far behind) already had some of the highest suicide rates in Europe as early as the period from the 1860s to the 1880s, when these data were first systematically made available. The rate in Saxony (think Dresden and Chemnitz) was consistently the highest in Europe throughout this period. But these historical and sociological facts might inconveniently interfere with the simple anti-communist message.<br/><br/>Don't worry, I am not about to undertake the Herculean task of defending the GDRand indeed there was a lot not to like. But if you really want to know something about it, not just wallow in feel-good anti-Communism, see Goodbye, Lenin, an infinitely better movie than LOO. Two negative perspectives, but both of them more serious than LOO, are Jan Schutte's Abschied/Farewell: Brecht's Last Summer and Peter Kahane's The Architects, about a group of young urban planners. And try some GDR movies, many of which had a more critical and humorous edge than you might expect, such as Egon Gunther's Der Dritte, a comedy about a slatternly, feisty single mom and bus cleaner. Yes, ordinary working people actually existed, rode on buses, drank beer, ate cold cuts, went to jobs, raised kids, enjoyed sex, and stood up to their bosses (the chronic labor shortage allowed workers to be far less subservient at the workplace than the ""free"" and pathetically insecure American employee has to be). The subject of the relative autonomy and equality of women is way to big to get intoChrista-Maria's limp victim-hood was not typicalyou can check this out in Christel Lane's article on women in the GDR in Sociology, Volume 17, no. 4, November,1989.<br/><br/>Bottom line on LOO: Don't believe everything you see; and you will see disappointingly little of the very attractive Sebastian Koch, whose talents are wasted in a glum and sexless part.."
"WriterDave","8","11","19","26 February 2007"," To Know Everything...
","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's ""The Lives of Others"" is a searing portrait of East Germany in the early 1980's before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The era of paranoia, suppression of free speech, and total state control of everything and everyone is masterfully displayed here in the intertwining stories of the Stasi police officer, his morally questionable superiors, and the actress and playwright they are spying on. Once again, the German people's love affair with authoritarianism and meticulously detailed records is featured here as the most intimate details of these people's lives are examined and we see the quiet tragedies of their everyday life stemming from their bizarrely married desires for freedom and attempts to rationalize their place and survive in the State and the Socialist movement. Superb acting, an excellent music score, and no-frills direction keep the film taut, sparse, and utterly transfixing in its evolving melodrama.<br/><br/>On an obvious surface level, ""The Lives of Others"" is the most psychologically astute look at voyeurism since Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" What makes the film compelling in its slow build up of tension and suspense, is that it is working on so many other levels. It can also be viewed as an allegory for the art of film making (or stage directing and writing) and the craft of acting, as we see the fractured psyche of the Stasi police officer--much like the blacklisted director character who commits suicide-- who so desperately wants to intervene and direct the troubling lives of those he surveys (the writer and actress--both wrestling with their own internal demons as their lives soon become not their own). So while it serves well as a timeless psychological case study into such minds, desires, and paranoia, it also functions as a very timely discussion about how much interference a government has the right to run into the lives of ordinary citizens.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" suffers from one major flaw, which will not be discussed at length for fear of giving away some of its intricate plot twists and theatrical climaxes. In the end, the film misses the final beat as it runs about ten or fifteen minutes too long past what would've been two serviceable and profound endings to arrive at a series of closing scenes that are all too pat. The first two hours were so rife with dramatic irony and subtle tension, that it's a shame the film rolls on beyond what would've been a sublimely ironic and stark conclusion (that arrives at a most pivotal moment in world history). Still, there was so much multi-layered and engrossing minutiae in those first two hours that the film's ultimate brilliance can not be denied because of one false note."

But this...it blew me away at how good it was.<br/><br/>The acting by all the cast was great, Martina Gedeck, Sebastian Koch...just brilliant, but Ulrich Mühe, top performance as the Stasi officer. <br/><br/>I don't want to add spoilers, but I I will say this, Out of the thousands of films I've seen, this is one of the best! A must watch for anyone, even if you don't usually watch subtitled films!"

","I'm a big fan of German movies, I always have a feeling of a very deep and human message that they can only understand and express. This movie might be about moral dilemmas, but does moral dilemmas really exists? Do we really have a difficult decision to make when we know what's always the right thing to do? This in my point of view is the real thread of the movie, moral choices. What's the right thing to do? To who we owe a good moral act? Can we be part of something that might be immoral and feel good about it? This movie is superb! The final line of the movie almost made me cry alone in my room. Very moving story, with great actors and a superb direction. I would watch this movie again and would definitely share it with a lot of people. The Lives of Others is now one of my top 10 movies of all times."
"hpsammler","9","5","7","6 February 2007"," Why are always woman weak?
","It's actually a great film, and I liked it very much. Unfortunately it once again fortifies the cliché of strong men and a weak woman which is nothing but a toy, a prize for which said men fight. Her suicide is highly constructed - I mean during the whole film only cars from the stasi drive on that road, and then, just when she wants to kill herself, another one arrives out of nowhere? Now to the greatness - I gave a low vote because I myself always read the ""bad"" reviews first, and I intend this as a reply to the ""don't believe the hype"" review.<br/><br/>Every person I know who lived in eastern Germany so far has confirmed that the setting is highly realistic. Claiming that anyone in the east German leadership would indeed live by puritan standards is ridiculous. The ""evil"" guy in this film (the ""minister"") is not only minister of culture, but also a member of the ZK (the polit bureau), this is mentioned in the film at least twice. A ZK member had the power to invoke the Stasi at will for sure.<br/><br/>The change of character of the ""hero"" may be artificial, but this doesn't really matter (the same goes for the unrealistic suicide scene). His change sets the stage for a beautiful story, the important part (portray of the Stasi-State) remains untouched by these weaknesses. I still would have preferred if that change would not have occurred, and if the woman would not have killed herself, and the apparatus would just have worked smoothly like it did for 50 years. But this would have deprived the film of any chance to become widely accepted - it's a movie after all, not a documentation.<br/><br/>I simply fail to understand how anybody could find something Stasi-friendly in this film."
"claudio_carvalho","9","8","13","13 May 2008"," Sonata for a Good Man
","In 1984, in East Germany, the popular actress addicted in pills Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) becomes the pivot of an investigation of the successful writer and her boyfriend and mate Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) by the secret police. The Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and former lover of Christa orders the ambitious Chief of Police Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to find evidences that Georg is not loyal to the party to get rid off him and stay with Christa, and the efficient agent Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to conduct surveillance on Georg's apartment. Wiesler does not find any evidence that could compromise Georg, until the day of his blacklisted friend and director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide. Georg decides to write an anonymous article to Der Spiegel about the hidden numbers of suicides in East Germany. However, Wiesler becomes fascinated with the lives and thoughts of George and Christa and covers his findings from his superiors.<br/><br/>""Das Leben der Anderen"" is another powerful German movie, showing the repressing and corrupted system supported by fear in East Germany in times of Cold War. This movie is practically perfect: the screenplay and story are engaging, disclosing a triangle of love that causes a political surveillance of an innocent man based on several characters that are perfectly developed. The pace is neither slow nor fast but very adequate, and uses an awesome cinematography. Therefore the work of the director and writer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is outstanding. The performances are top-notch, but the actor Ulrich Mühe is amazingly perfect, deserving an Oscar, and Martina Gedeck gives a great credibility to her abused character. I usually watch many movies , but ""Das Leben der Anderen"" is certainly among the best recent movies I have seen, if not the best. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Vida dos Outros"" (""The Life of the Others"")"
"Chris_Docker","10","8","13","13 April 2007"," Can you dance as if there's no-one watching?
","Maybe you know the saying, ""Dance as if no-one were watching, sing as if no-one were listening""? I wonder why we say that? Is there something magical about privacy? Something that lets the spirit free? Our story starts before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Stasi, East Germany's Secret Police, has refined its way of dealing with artists. No violence. Psychology. Persuasion. Surveillance. The lives of others are not their own. Most artists give up. Many commit suicide. Your best friend. Your lover. Georg Dreyman is lucky. He survives.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others spans seven years - from 1984 to 1991. The first hour sets the scene so we are completely immersed in Communist Germany. Then Dreyman and his partner confront the fact that their lives are being compromised. The emotional intensity is in gut-wrenching contrast to the bland story so far. Finally, as the Stasi surveillance kicks in, they wonder if they can survive - or even if they want to.<br/><br/>One of the film's strengths and weaknesses is that the characters are so believable. Dreyman is a sophisticated intellectual, a successful playwright. His partner, Christa-Maria, is an acclaimed actress. Then there's Stasi agent Gerd Wiesler, a heart-felt supporter of the communism, who is assigned to spy on them. Wiesler has a crisis of conscience and decides not to prosecute Dreyman. The Lives of Others has created debate and furore in Germany. Firstly, because the ex-Stasi now try to portray the regime as none too harmful. Secondly, because the facts show that, with the system of double-checks that were in place, no such character as Wiesler existed or could have existed. The film's director says it is about the ability of human beings to do the right thing, no matter how far they have gone down the wrong path. It seems like a good story (as long as we don't re-write history in the process).<br/><br/>As I came out of a packed multiplex auditorium, I marvelled. People turning out in such numbers to see a subtitled movie. And so they should. But, its Oscar win (Best Foreign Language) apart, The Lives of Others is particularly poignant to British audiences. A poll published at the end of 2006 indicated almost 80% of us agree that Britain has become a 'surveillance society'.<br/><br/>This is why The Lives of Others strikes such a chord. Thousands of new offences, limitations on freedom of assembly, on privacy, freedom of movement, the right to silence, and freedom of speech. Privacy International ranks the UK ahead of the US, Europe and most developing countries, as a 'world worst offender' for surveillance, and as 'an endemic surveillance society' (in the same category as Russia and China). We are by far the most-watched nation on earth, with a CCTV camera for every 14 people. Apart from such corrosive effects of surveillance (notably, in our film, on artists), new technology (including DNA and tracking of non-suspects) raises nightmarish possibilities of abuse. When disaster hits Dreyman's life, it is because a high-up official is abusing the system. Dreyman and Christa-Maria's lives are shattered, and he becomes determined to help expose the disease in their society.<br/><br/>As I catch the bus home from the cinema (watched by more CCTV), I read a newspaper report of an Aberdeen University study finding tough government policies aimed at curbing Islamic radicalism are having the opposite effect. Since 9/11, Britain has eroded the principles it claims to be defending, and people fear (with some justification) that the Government's 'bottom-up accountability' is a blueprint for a 21st century version of a police state. A vicious circle? The Stasi had many more times the secret police that Nazi Germany had - but under a politer system. And modern technology even does away with the need for so many human operatives. The Lives of Others does not feature Gestapo tactics (and the Gestapo only had 30,000 secret police, against the Stasi's 200,000). This is the 1980s, and the Stasi are modern-looking officials, not hit-men. Most of them have been convinced that their work is for the public good.<br/><br/>Dreyman is criticised for minor offences - possessing Western newspapers. It gives them a polite excuse to keep tabs. One perhaps thinks of the UK DNA database (the world's largest) that samples those who have committed very minor offences - or no offence at all. The official reason for diversifying surveillance on Dreyman is, ""lack of suspicious acts."" Our fictitious 'good man' in this multifaceted masterwork, (and to whom Dreyman eventually dedicates a novel) is in some aspects played by Ulrich Muhe. In a strange irony, Muhe has examined his own Stasi files - from the days when he was an actor in East Germany. He found his former wife had informed on him through the six years of their marriage. For Muhe, the Brechtian self-awareness that is referenced (but never directly used) in the film gives it a meaning beyond mere entertainment. The movie's style is mainstream - as if 'no-one was watching'. We just identify with what is happening on screen. But then we think about our own lives. Whether it is ""the grey men who ensure safety in our land"" or the emotional ties, and how far would you go to protect a loved one, or how far someone could go to mess with your head.<br/><br/>Watch and listen carefully: the Lives of Others is a film that can cut deep."
"marissas75","10","8","13","31 March 2007"," Good German(s)
","Since the early days of film-making--actually, since the first plays were written--the gold standard for a good dramatic work is one that combines an intriguing plot with complex characters, to illuminate something about human behavior. It's surprising, then, that so many movies still fall short of the mark. At the risk of oversimplifying things, plot-heavy movies tend to ignore character development, and character-study movies ignore a streamlined plot for the sake of a series of episodes. It takes something like ""The Lives of Others,"" an excellent and moving drama, to remind you of how great a movie can be when it combines these elements.<br/><br/>Not only does this movie have a suspenseful plot that follows the logic of cause-and-effect until everything ties together beautifully, but the workings of the plot are unpredictable, and intimately linked to the characters' psychology. For drama does not result merely from watching external events happen to characters, but from seeing them actively make choices that affect their own lives and (forgive the pun) the lives of others. <br/><br/>The set-up is simple but highly resonant: in 1984 East Berlin, by-the-book Stasi agent Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to wiretap and listen in on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). But because Dreyman has always presented himself as a loyal citizen, Wiesler dimly begins to realize just how paranoid and corrupt his government is. Also, he becomes fascinated with the couple's warm, semi-bohemian lifestyle, which contrasts with his own solitary existence. Wiesler thus finds himself reconsidering his values, while at the same time Georg and Christa-Maria reconsider theirs. Should Georg use his writing talent to reveal the horrible conditions in East Germany? Should Christa-Maria submit to a lustful government minister, who could ruin her career if he doesn't get his way? These choices are hard, and only lead to more hard choices.<br/><br/>This plot allows for scenes loaded with the great dramatic irony and subtext that results from one character knowing something that another does not. The movie's complex and intelligent themes include theatre/fakery/acting versus real life, and the voyeurism of a spy versus the voyeurism of a cinema-goer. And above all, ""The Lives of Others"" is a moving exploration of ethics and humanity. Not many recent movies ask the question ""What does it really mean to be a good person?"" and even fewer answer it with the honesty and depth that this film does.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" does not over-explain itself--none of the characters can confide in anyone, so they make their difficult choices without talking about why they've acted that way. Yet everything that happens in the movie has the ring of emotional truth. Thanks to the beautifully realized performances, you never doubt that the characters would behave in exactly that way, nor that they feel deep anguish in coming to their decisions.<br/><br/>I haven't seen all the acclaimed movies from the past year yet, but as it stands now, ""The Lives of Others"" is my choice for the best movie of 2006."

"pefrss","10","8","13","3 March 2007"," Surveyed to death
","There were many reasons for me to see this movie.<br/><br/>Some of my relatives lived in East Germany and could not get out. I never visited them before the wall fell, but as it was my mother's sister, Mom went to visit her sister on a regular basis over the years. She came back telling strange tales, that her sister and her husband were afraid to talk politics in their own house and always signaled to my mother to shut up. Nobody trusted anybody and parents were even afraid of their children, because the children were so indoctrinated by the regime. The older East-German generation suffered under and hated the all-present surveillance , but the younger ones were believers in the system. <br/><br/>The reunification of the two Germanys brought a lot of problems and many of the former East Germans missed parts of their old way of life because it took care of them. <br/><br/>Some good movies have been made to illustrate what life was like under the communist rule. One of my favorite is ""Goodbye Lenin"", which is hilariously funny and deeply sad at the same time.<br/><br/>I saw ""The lives of others"" at the first matinée when it opened in my town. The theater was half full , which was unusual for a foreign language film at such an early hour. Usually five people would be a high number.<br/><br/>All through the movie fear kept creeping up in me. Are we not there too? Are we not being surveyed everywhere and at all times? Wherever we go ,there are surveillance cameras. In the streets, in the shops, at work, at banks, in parking lots, even at home. They keep records of every move we do. They can trace practically all our financial expenditures, they know what we eat, where we shop, what we buy, how often we return or exchange items. They issue us all these plastic cards, which record everything we do. They know our medical history, our relationships, our criminal records and every move we make on the Internet, or who we contact on the phone. And that is without anybody taking a specific interest in us. Well, the interest is mostly to get to us to spend money. We are only of interest as long as we are consumers. Because our system is based on consumerism and has to be preserved. Now another interest is terrorism and we are even more under scrutiny.<br/><br/>The East German surveillance was based on preservation of their control system. They needed to keep control, because otherwise people could find out, that the system was not so good and they might revolt or leave the country. Like in our system, only a few people really profited from the system, the others were paying the price. The movie makes the case for artists paying the price of not being able to make art anymore. Many did not want to live that way and ended their own lives. East Germany stopped counting the suicides, because there were too many. The movie's main theme is about that fact.<br/><br/>I see suicide broader. There are many forms of slow suicides. Drugs, alcohol, overeating, mind numbing . ""I see dead people everywhere"", but mine have still living bodies, but the soul is gone or was never developed. We should all ask ourselves the question: Are we fully alive? Or are we just vegetating? Has our system turned us in brave little consumers without any other purpose in life?<br/><br/>Are we still caring and compassionate people or are we so indoctrinated by our system of consumerism that we judge people only by credit rating, status and material accumulations?<br/><br/>I hope, the fact, that the movie received an Oscar, will bring a big audience in the theaters. East Germany is not so far from the U.S. today."

","Artists are dangerous to dictatorships as this film so ably proves. A work of art, such as this film about life in the GDR, has the power to influence opinion in a way that history books cannot. In the interview with director Donnersmarck on the DVD extras he mentions that he spent a year and a half doing research for this. He read everything he could on the GDR and conducted extensive interviews with former GDR people, including ex-Stasi agents. Many of the actors are East Germans including Ulrich Mühe who was himself under surveillance by the Stasi. All of this reflects Donnersmark's stated desire for authenticity, down to using original surveillance equipment and filming some of the final scenes in the actual Stasi archives. In any case, if we were to abstract this story from any basis in reality and view it as fiction, it is still powerful. By concentrating on a few individuals it presents a chilling view of the effects of living in a repressive dictatorship. I found this movie to have a keener effect on me than Wells' ""1984.""<br/><br/>The movie poses the question of what a good man is to do when living in a fascist regime. Those who wield the power have the techniques down as to how to control the citizenry - threats to family, threats to job, brutal interrogation, and even torture. If someone knows enough about you, it is a trivial matter to exploit your vulnerabilities to keep you in line. How much would you compromise? How much would you risk in order to be true to yourself? <br/><br/>The most fascinating aspect of this film for me deals with the moral dilemmas faced by its two main protagonists - the theater director and writer Georg Dreyman and the Stasi agent Hauptmann Wiesler who sets up full surveillance on Dreyman. Both are torn between loyalties to their professions, their county, their friends, and ultimately each to his own conscience. <br/><br/>Mühe plays Wiesler with subtlety - he turns in an awesome performance primarily achieved through facial expression and body movement. His gradual transformation is wonderful to behold and there is enough ambiguity to keep you guessing as to the causes. Does his surveillance of Dreyman provoke jealousy, sympathy, sexual longings, shame, enlightenment, all of these, or what? And Dreyman's transformation is no less interesting, albeit more easily understood. If you like movies where events change people, you will like this.<br/><br/>The colors are a bit drab - grays, greens, and browns. But they reflect an implied drabness as to what life was like in the GDR. I wish there were more commentaries on IMDb from those who lived through this. <br/><br/>The musical score offers a perfect backdrop.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" is absorbing and virtually flawless."

","The first mention should go to the actors, who gave such engaging and moving performances. The plot and directing are superb, in fact it is incredibly hard to fault this film.<br/><br/>The topic of the Stasi in East Germany shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall is one I have only seen dealt with in the more light-hearted ""Goodbye Lenin"". ""The Lives of Others"" portrays a far more dark side to the regime. I defy anybody to find a reason not to like this film, as the message goes far deeper into investigating the impact of espionage upon human relationships and emotions. The ending is amazing, and without giving too much away it is implicitly simple in its insinuation of the bond which has formed between the two principle characters.<br/><br/>If you only see one film this year, make it this one.

Another thing is has in common with Shawshank is that you see the worst in human nature but at the very end, you also see the very best in us too.<br/><br/>The director clearly has faith in the good we can do to each other, and why not? We see enough stupidity and ugliness in film, why not reflect on the beauty also? Everything about this film is top-notch, the direction, the actors, the production, the dialog, the visuals, the close-ups - proof-positive that as long as you have a competent crew and an excellent script, then you don't need hundreds of millions to make a film, that you can make an excellent film with the simplest of elements as long as you know exactly what message you want to convey - a lesson many a studio-head in LA can think about.<br/><br/>It's an indictment on the film industry that this masterpiece will not be seen by the millions of film-goers the world over and have the audience it deserves, that only the film festival crowds, the art-house film crowd and the IFC-channel crowd will be gifted by this film. If it's playing in your town, make it a point to see it before it goes.<br/><br/>Now there's buzz that some Hollywood director may make an ""American"" version of this in English - big mistake if you ask me - Look what happened when they touched Wim Wenders' ""Wings of Desire"" ---> ""City of Angels"" - don't do it, leave this film alone, it deserves to be seen in it's original format, the reality of the former East Germany, the Stasi, the real cost of freedom and democracy are all lessons we need to know about."

","East Germany. 1984. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (played by Ulrich Mühe) is a stasi agent ordered to monitor a successful playwright Georg Dreyman (played by Sebastian Koch).

","I had been waiting to see this film ever since I read about it and it was even better than I expected. First of all it made me sad that American movies so seldom stretch to achieve what film is really capable of as an art form which I believe this film does. The acting was unbelievable, especially the performance of the actor who played Wiesler His communication of the changes this man went through, how we went from being a lonely automaton to risking everything ""for others"" was a landmark of acting, the transition was made through his expressions and his actions, without any speeches or lightning bolts from heaven. All of the acting was superb, even the ""villains"" in the chain of command who epitomized the banality of evil and the mindset of someone who ""goes along to get along"" The arc of the relationship between the playwright and his mistress the actress was poignant and showed the pressures people can give in to when they feel they have no where else to turn. The complexity of the plot requires close attention, but it doesn't drag or get tedious. Finally the poignancy of the situation was heightened by our knowledge, but not that of the protagonists, that within just a few years this whole rotten structure would come tumbling down. This is a film that is required viewing for any true film lover"

Because we were working in various theaters there, the theater people were very much like former associates. Gerd Wiesler's apartment and apartment building were almost like the one that we lived in for 7 years, except that our building had no elevator. The kitchen and linoleum were exactly the same as ours. His neighbors were much like the people who lived in our building. The television was just right. If they didn't want to watch DDR propaganda, they could flip over to ""MOSCOW 1"" to get Russian propaganda or American films dubbed in Russian!. We almost expected to see someone we knew in the crowd scenes. This re-creation was accurate to the last detail, even the sounds of the car and truck engines.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Perhaps that is the way it was in East Germany at the time just before the wall was turn down; ridged and strict. This film is about an exacting and no nonsense secret police officer/agent, Gerd, who works for the Stasi (German Secret Police) as a spy to uproot any anti-socialist movements. He is sent to spy on Dryman, a notable playwright, as there is suspicious he isn't as loyal as he seems to the Socialists. While Dryman is the one in the crosshairs, the main character with the deeper character arc really is the agent Gerd. As he lurks into every emotional aspect of Dryman's life and relationships he begins to actually warm up and care for him and those omit occasional details. When Gerd's boss asks for detailed reports, will he notice any omissions in Gerd's reports? Will Gerd allow Dryman's true intentions to be discovered or will Gerd's boss uncover his diluted reports? This film's tone was serious with a color pallet complimenting the rigidness of the era and government overreach. The story moved at a methodical pace that matched a thorough and detailed story."

The introduction of the characters Dreyman and Sieland is also nice, especially if, like me, you watch the movie without any prior knowledge toward this movie. The transition that Wiesler undergoes during the movie is portrayed nicely. This is even better because the movie uses less scene montages. The depiction of Grubitz's dangerous character through bits and pieces scattered along this movie is also nice. I like how Ulrich Muhe played the calm yet meticulous and then the affected version of Wiesler. Martina Gedeck also shows a good performance and went total on this movie.

","Edmund Burke wrote that all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. ""The Lives of Others"" shows the corollary: all that is necessary for the defeat of evil is that good men do something. Indeed, the musical leitmotiv for the film is called ""Sonata for a Good Man"".<br/><br/>Imagine (if you will) that, in George Orwell's ""1984"", instead of spying on and betraying Winston Smith and Julia, Charrington the junk-shop dealer -- or perhaps O'Brien himself -- commits thoughtcrime, defies Big Brother and the principles of Ingsoc, and acts to protect the two rebels.<br/><br/>You would then have the basic premise and scenario for ""The Lives of Others"", Germany's entry for Best Foreign Film of 2006, which significantly is set in 1984, not years in the future, but the here-and-now present.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" narrates how a servant of the state becomes increasingly aware of its intrinsic evil, and risks not only his career but indeed his freedom, to help subvert and overthrow the system.<br/><br/>This film about East Germany's state police (the Stasi) explores the philosophical and ethical issues in far greater depth, and with far more emotional resonance, than ""Breach"", an American film of the same year that limits itself to mere spy-versus-spy intrigue.<br/><br/>It is instructive and ironic that the film begins with an explanatory note about the atmosphere that prevailed in 1984, when Glasnost (openness) had not yet begun in the former Soviet Union and its satellite countries, and the Berlin Wall had not yet fallen. For those of my generation who remember that fateful event, no such explanation is necessary. For those who had not yet been born, no such explanation is adequate."

","First of all: Yes, it is a very interesting film and it is worth seeing. I think it is a good start for thinking about the DDR, I hope it is a start for ""Aufarbeitung"". There has not been a real discussion about what happened before 1989, yet. <br/><br/>I am thankful that the film gives a kind of insight and an emotional impression. I doubt that most of the people would feel emotionally involved when reading a nonfictional book about the German Democratic Republic.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things I could name which I liked about this film. Ulrich Mühe and Ulrich Tukur are great actors, I always enjoy watching Ulrich Mühe. <br/><br/>I think some of the actors playing bit parts are really worth to keep in mind: Ralf Ehrlich who appears twice (he is the one who tells the joke about Honecker); Volker Michalowski who plays the expert for typewriters; Marie Gruber (she must be the one who plays the sad neighbour with the secret) and the prostitute... I cannot find the name of the actress at the IMDb.<br/><br/>I believe other will emphasise what they do like about ""Das Leben der Anderen"" so I would like to write down what disappointed me. The soundtrack music was much too strong for my personal taste. This is the problem with most Hollywood films or films in Hollywood style: There is so much music in the foreground that it leaves no places for your own thoughts, ideas, impressions and feelings. Sometimes the music *dictates* what the viewer is supposed to feel and how he should react. To explain my problem I always give the example that in some scenes the viewer is simply forced to grab the next handkerchief. Most people might enjoy that, but I do like to *choose* how I feel when watching a scene. I want to be able to concentrate on how the actors deliver the scene, how it is put in pictures and everything else the is to notice beside that overwhelming music. Maybe you get an idea what I try to say.<br/><br/>I do not want to be mean but I have to say... to the end of the film I had the impression I was watching a kind of ""Schindler's List"" about the DDR. (I won't explain that to Spielberg fans!!!)<br/><br/>Still I do believe it is a start. I hope there are more films about that topic to follow!"
"HastnKeks","10","9","16","1 April 2006"," story about the relationship of a GDR Stasi-Spy and the one he spies on
","This is a topic not yet really explored by filmmakers or authors. There are a whole bunch of stories about the GDR, but nobody ever thought about what effects the spying had on the spy and how it changed him.<br/><br/>In the opinion of some people, who really experienced the GDR there are some major mistakes in the story, though it really depends on where one stood back then. For example: a Stasi-general could not easily command to spy on a loyal GDR-citizen just because he wanted to have his wife. The Stasi was corrupt in some ways, but a lot better organized than the Nazis where in the 3. Reich, and a case like this would have been a big exception.<br/><br/>So the movie is maybe not the best to show how things really were, but it tells a story which could have happened,too, nicely made into a good to watch event. The actors belong to the best in Germany and show a typical piece of German film-making which really fits the story. wonderful"
"Delmare","6","19","40","12 April 2007"," Not nearly as good as it could have been
","The premise is interesting, the acting is good, the subject matter is extremely important and more than a little malnourished in Hollywood cinema, the characters are engaging, the camera pulls it weight . . . in short, there's a lot that's working with this movie, but unfortunately, it isn't quite enough to lift it above the ravages of mediocrity.<br/><br/>Chief among the offenses is the fact that the entire story relies on an ill-defined protagonist, Wiesler of the Stasi, a man introduced to us as the epitome of the heartless bureaucratic killing machine who ends up capitulating to sentiment. The film tries to justify this shift by stripping Wiesler's mission of legitimacy a quarter of the way through the film: Christa-Marie (CM), one of the subjects of the investigation, is having an illicit affair with Bruno Hempf, Wiesler's superior and the authorizer of the operation. Hempf hopes to imprison Dreyman, the boyfriend of CM and Wiesler's primary subject, with no higher aim than ridding himself of a romantic rival. <br/><br/>This revelation  and Wiesler's disgust upon discovering it  offers adequate justification for the aging operative's loss of enthusiasm for his mission. Unfortunately, it offers no justification whatsoever for why he continues protecting Dreyman after the struggling writer actually involves himself in rebellious, anti-Governmental activities. We're left to assume that the predator fell in love with the prey, a difficult supposition, since up until this point, it's not clear that Wiesler is capable of any kind of feeling. In the opening scene, he drives a suspect to hysteria in order to obtain a trivial lead. He reports one of his students to the police because the student used the word ""inhuman"" to describe the Stasi's practices. He terrorizes Dreyman's neighbor into silence by threatening to interfere with her daughter's education. He chastises a co-worker repeatedly for showing up four minutes late to his shift. In short, there is nothing in Wiesler's character that suggests he is anything other than a man who lives by the book, thinks by the book, and tortures by the book, and all of his allegiances go toward the law.<br/><br/>Why, then, does he take pity on Dreyman? Why does he rescind on his upbringing? Why is this particular mission any different from the hundreds of others that preceded it, aside from the dubious activities of the bigwig who authorized it? If Wiesler is cracking under the pressure of his duty, why don't we see evidence of it beforehand? What separates Wiesler from his peers, who show no sign of compassion whatsoever? <br/><br/>Any film that relies on leaps of faith doesn't pass as art in my book. It's not believable, and it's not compelling. <br/><br/>Add to the equation the heavy-handed editing, the obnoxiously emotive music, and the occasional corny line (""and to think that men like you once ran a country"") and you arrive at a movie that, like so many others before it, compromised its chances for greatness and stalled out blandly with ""decent."""
"evanston_dad","10","8","14","26 February 2007"," A Beautiful Statement About Humanity Triumphing Over Oppression
","This superb, gripping film tells the story of a celebrated playwright, Georg Dreyman (played subtly by Sebastian Koch) living in the stifling oppression of the German Democratic Republic in the early 1980s, who is put under surveillance by a cabinet minister who loves Dreyman's girlfriend, the ill-fated Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and wants an excuse to ruin Dreyman's life. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe, giving the film's best performance) is assigned surveillance duties, and stakes himself out in the attic of Dreyman's apartment building, listening in on Dreyman's conversations and numerous intimacies. Dreyman is not a subversive, at least not in deed, until a beloved friend in the theatre commits suicide because of a ruined career brought about by the GDR officials. This loss compels Dreyman to action, and he writes a scathing indictment of the GDR which he publishes anonymously in a West German liberal magazine. Wiesler knows that Dreyman is the author, but has become so fascinated by Dreyman and his life, and so doubtful as to the moral motives of the GDR, that instead of turning Dreyman into the authorities, he becomes his secret accomplice.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" begins solidly but unremarkably. I enjoyed the first half hour or so of the film, but wasn't heavily involved in it. But it works a kind of intense, gradual spell, and before I realized it, I was engrossed in this story and cared deeply about how it would end. A plot summary makes it sound like a highbrow soap opera, or like something we've seen before, but it's not either of these things. It's a thematically rich film anchored by a strong central character in Wiesler. He's fascinated by Dreyman's life -- his artistic abilities, his circle of friends and the stimulus of freely shared ideas, the love and companionship he shares with an attractive woman -- but it's Wiesler who for us becomes the fascinating character. We see his life juxtaposed to Dreyman's -- coming home to an empty apartment, hiring a prostitute for a fleeting moment of intimacy -- and we understand exactly why he takes the actions he does throughout the film. His life is utterly lacking in any kind of artistic or intellectual freedom, and when he begins to fake reports about the goings on in Dreyman's apartment, making up entire episodes and even giving elaborate details about a fake play he claims Dreyman is writing, we see how just the tiny bit of freedom granted him to create something completely his own becomes the crack in the foundation of his loyalty to his superiors. It's a wonderful statement about the power of free thought to combat oppression, and at the same time a lovely story about simple human kindness. The ending especially is breathtaking in its sweet simplicity.<br/><br/>And as I'm a fan of film scores, let me say that this film has a marvelous one, especially the recurring passage of pulsing strings that drives the movie forward and creates all the hair-raising tension of a Hitchcock film.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"GaryJohnston","5","19","41","24 July 2007"," thematically weak
","The praise for this movie is hyperbolic and unearned. The ""transformation"" of the main character, which happens very quickly, and with only limited attention paid to him, is shoddily done, bad film-making passed off as something mysterious. It is abundantly clear why this movie has found a wide release in America and why it won the foreign language Oscar--it is typical Hollywood tripe. Major, unearned character developments, portrait of totalitarian society which, post-Orwell, post-Communism, post-Gorbachev even, is amazingly banal.<br/><br/>But the one thing I want to touch on here is the preachy, artistic pompousness that stains every part of the film. We're led to believe, implicitly, that it is not the love between the two artists which affects their observer, but art itself. Was anyone else offended by this? The first scene, of the collaborator's interrogation, shows that the main character is essentially inhuman, a lifelong devotee of the party. But then he undergoes a miraculous change, evidently finding more humanity and love in Brecht than in a crying, tortured man sitting across from him. It's implausible, and reveals the filmmaker's limited vision--it allows the film to harp on the importance of art, which, like the totally obvious revelations about totalitarianism, should be taken as a given within any work of art. Obviously, art is redeeming--we wouldn't be watching the movie if it wasn't.<br/><br/>A perfect example of the offensive simplicity of this movie is found when the male artist speaks a line something along the lines of, ""If one loves art can he be anything else but a good man?"" The main character, listening in, then goes home to his lonely life, meets a boy in the elevator who blabs incriminatingly about his father, is about to ask the name to arrest him, but then, supposedly remembering the quote about a ""good man,"" shies away.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" is not bad, it is just unsurprising and uninspiring. Reflect on why this movie got a wide release in the states, and why it won an Oscar. But, I guess, if you think ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Crash"" are deserving of their Oscars, then you would have no idea what I'm talking about. There is a link between those awards winners and this--infantile storytelling and thematic barrenness.<br/><br/>Watch the last 20 minutes of ""The Pianist"" to see a more accurate human story about politics, art, and hatred. Or watch ""The Conformist"" for a more complex view of life under totalitarianism."
"wl323","Null","7","12","15 April 2007"," beautiful - I am deeply touched
","While most comments at this website have touched on the plot in detail, I have one minor point to add regarding the story per se. Then, I will explain what so special about this movie that makes it become my favorite.<br/><br/>There are a few reviews implying that Sieland relies on some sort of illegal drug. It never occurred to me that Sieland is a drug user. The only understanding I had as I was watching the film was that she takes contraceptive pill, and the reason she needs the medication is that she is very devoted to her career, for which she cannot afford to be pregnant for the time being. At the same time, it indicates that being sexually harassed by high ranked Stasi officials is so common and predictable that she knew it would happen to her at any time. She also knows very well that her career will be ruined if she does not accommodate their unreasonable demands. To protect herself and save her own career, she needs the pills. Or, the government was being so authoritarian that they even restricted the use of contraceptive pills? Upon the end of the movie – Wiesler's answering to the book store cashier ""It is for me"", followed by his coda – my mind kept saying BEAUTIFUL! I was deeply touched. I felt happy, but also sad for him. It really took me a while to realize why I love this movie so much. Subtlety it is. There is at least one User Comment which has pointed out this particular quality of the movie. Sorry that I cannot find another word to make my point. What I can do is to elaborate on it from a different angle. I have found the subtlety from the intriguing relationship among the characters – the watcher and the watched.<br/><br/>As a secret agent, Wiesler is a god-like watcher, who knows what is happening and what is going to happen. As long as he is in power, he can even change the fate of his surveillance targets. As a god, he tried to protect. For instance, he alerted Dreyman to find out the business between his girl friend and the Minister of Cultural Department. He persuaded Sieland not to meet with the Minister, which saved her pride and Dreyman's love to her. He even took away the typewriter, the evidence of the ""crime"". As the all mighty being, he can also treat the earthly- the watched, as playthings. Indeed, he almost did it. He did not tip-off the custom at the border. That tricked Dreyman and his writer friends into the belief that they are free from surveillance and getting the anti-government essay published. Eventually, Wiesler chose to be a protective god, because paradoxically, this god-like figure has been mellowed gradually by the earthly – the politically powerless but artistically powerful couple. Wiesler has changed from steely to soft, from apathetic to sentimental. Audience might have asked how come Wiesler, as a professor in spying, and an experienced secret agent, would be affected by his targets. Even I asked - Does it mean that none of his targets in the past twenty years, including those die-hard union leaders and preachers or intellectuals, have never criticized communism or socialism strong and clearly enough to make Weisler understand what so wrong with the government? Does it mean that the opinions of Sieland and Dreyman on the government are any different from other dissidents? No and No.<br/><br/>What is the magic that makes Weisler change then? Dreyman and Sieland symbolize the beauty of life; they show Wiesler that life should include compassion, integrity, freedom, individuality as well as love (romantic love and friendship). They have managed to bring all these unalienable humanity aspects into his consciousness through art and their lives.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is another god-like figure above Wiesler – Stasi. When he was found having helped Dreyman slip through the police control, he was condemned to be a ""nobody"" with all his power taken away and became a member of the earthly. After Stasi was removed from power, Dreyman has the chance to find out the story of his ""guardian angel"". From this point on, he is the watcher and Weisler is the watched; their positions switched. Dreyman is not like a god here but the way he communicates with Weisler is the same. There is hardly any direct contact between them. The spatial distance however is thoughtfully kept with an unspoken understanding.<br/><br/>For Wiesler, the distance is necessary not just because he does not want to jeopardize his career, but also because he needs to keep Dreyman and Sieland under his wing when they are walking the line of upsetting the government. For Dreyman, he respects Wiesler's decision of staying anonymous; he does not want to disrupt Wielser's quiet life. So he just shows his gratefulness by dedicating his book to him. "" It's for me"" – this witty remarks signifies that Wiesler now at least has an unmet friend ( Dreyman) in his life, in contrast to his earlier life when he did not share the same values with his boss /coworkers or other so-called comrades, and the only person who gave him solace was a big fat money-minded prostitute. It is sad to see Weisler being alone with the stiff face again towards the end of the movie. I was hoping that the influence of Dreyman and Sieland would not stop at the latter's death. I wished to see him accompanied by friends and lovers or families. I wished to see him have a more colorful life.<br/><br/>Maybe he will. Maybe he has it. Just that the director did not show us"

I fell in love and became intiamtely attached with all the characters. Mankind have invented some pretty useful things but thisfilm shows us an invention of a social system on par with, say, the atomic bomb. I actually felt relieved walking out of the theater,knowing that this tense, suspenseful and gorgeously done, emotional nightmare was over.

"Radu_A","4","24","55","26 December 2008"," overrated artificial kitsch, I'm sorry to say
","I must say that ever since watching this picture I felt that it was grossly overrated, mainly because of its artistic limitations and because I felt that it does no justice to its hype.<br/><br/>While the Stasi investigation methods portrayed here are definitely correct and meticulously researched by the director for a period of (reportedly) 1.5 years, the characters come across as extremely shallow. It looks as if the director/script writer first picked up a certain Stasi lingo/ investigatory framework and then built his film around that, rather than working from existing characters. That gives the story a decidedly artificial feel.<br/><br/>Therefore none of the figures really convinced me, safe Ulrich Mühe's lead of course. Yet this Swan-Lake-like performance of a brilliant actor who already knew that he was terminally ill at the time of the shoot may raise this film out of the realm of the ordinary, but it still has all the makings of a sophisticated TV movie rather than a theatrical release. Also, as someone who grew up (in part) in East Germany, I must say that the portrayal of a state-endorsed writer appears to be intolerably naive, and that in order to achieve such a rank, it would have been quite necessary to sell out on your colleagues way before this painful choice presents itself in the movie. And, pardon me, but Sebastian Koch is a TV actor, and a pretty bad one at that.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the sappy soundtrack by otherwise fondly remembered Gabriel Yared transforms the already debatable historical drama into mere kitsch - the music feels like glue at times. It would seem that it was precisely this kitsch-cliché aspect which made this film such a success with American critics and aged intellectuals, but for German audiences (at least me and my friends) it added to a calculated shallowness that may serve to win an Academy Award, but doesn't really do justice to its subject. The director's follow-up 'The Tourist' has been rightfully criticized for pretty much the same reasons given here, so hopefully the undue support for this film will be reconsidered."
"Sec_Education","10","6","10","10 July 2007"," Near perfect
","This is one of the best movies I have seen. It made me an instant fan of Ulrich Mühe, whose performance was convincing, intelligent and moving.<br/><br/>In what may be spoilers (avert eyes if you have not seen the film), I will address a point another reviewer made about the point where and why Wiesler turns.<br/><br/>Wiesler is a socialist true believer. He draws no distinction between leadership and underlings in the lunchroom. He does he job very well, but he leads a very modest life (e.g. rice and food from a tube). That is why he is able to do such an unctuous job without qualms.<br/><br/>That is until he learns of how corrupt his leadership is. He learns that he has been tasked with digging up dirt on Dreyman not because there is any dirt, but because one of the party bigwigs sees the writer as a rival for the carnal attentions of Sieland. He decides that he will not be party to the corruption, and that is where his first act of insurrection begins - alerting Dreyman to the fact that Sieland is being coerced into relations with Minister Hempf. Ever smart, he does this through an act of plausible deniability - making the doorbell ring fortuitously.<br/><br/>His subversive activities escalate throughout the film, but the above moment is where it truly begins, and why. He is tested several times throughout the movie. His urge to do as trained conflicts with his urge to do what is right, and he goes with what is right. It certainly helps that he lives such a lonely existence without anything really to live for.<br/><br/>Another point that few other reviewers bore noticing. It shows that life post 1989 is not all beer and skittles. Graffiti is omnipresent, Wiesler is reduced to a task that only the most rabid Ayn Rand fanatic could get excited about - delivering junk mail, and foreigners are colonizing Germany. Perhaps there was some good in the GDR after all. Subtle, but the point was made.<br/><br/>This movie also serves to highlight that if those in power want to watch you, you will be watched, and you won't be able to detect it (especially with 20 years technology more than the GDR ever had). I hope that if you are worthy of this honor, you will someone as kind as HGW looking out for you."
"tintin-23","10","5","8","15 January 2008"," Stasi wants ""to know everything
","The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. It is a fictitious story based on historical facts. The film's characters, compiled from many different real-life figures, including several of its actors, themselves the victims of Stasi surveillance and persecutions, contributed immensely toward the authenticity of the film.<br/><br/>von Donnersmarck's quest for authenticity led him to shoot in as many original locations in East Berlin as possible, such as in the former Stasi headquarters, including Stasi's original file-card archives. All of the furniture and objects needed for the film - bugs, surveillance equipment, a room full of machines that steam open letters, and so on, are all original items, gathered from private collectors and museums. Captain Wiesler lives in one of these drab, lifeless, high-rise apartment buildings prevalent in the Eastern European countries under communist regimes, while playwright Georg Dreyman occupies a gentrified apartment in an old building, typical of the old Berlin. The cinematography contributes greatly to the film's atmosphere. The colors are pale and unsaturated. Brown, gray, beige, orange, and especially green dominate the palette, with blues and reds noticeably absent.<br/><br/>The success of this film owes much to the high caliber of its actors. The beautiful Martina Gedeck, recipient of many awards, gives a subtle, vulnerable performance. Sebastian Koch's insouciant, bordering on arrogant, attitude of an adulated playwright is convincing. Multitalented Ulrich Tukur renders the role of a devious, opportunistic department head perfectly, and Thomas Thieme is absolutely repulsive as the lecherous Culture Minister. But it is Ulrich Mühe 's superb performance, the depth and subtlety of emotions that underscore his acting as he evolves from an ideological bureaucrat into a compassionate human being, which is most fascinating.<br/><br/>Another asset of the production is haunting film score, composed by the multiple award-winner, Gabriel Yared. This sorrowful and complex music was recorded by the outstanding Prague Symphony Orchestra.<br/><br/>von Donnersmarck offers viewers a cathartic second ending to his film, an equivalent of a musical coda or a literary epilogue, which is a welcome relief to the viewers. There is indeed an under-current of sadness that builds up slowly, imperceptibly, as the film progresses. If The Lives of Others is a political thriller, it is also a human drama, and it is a tribute to the director's artistry and depth that draws his audience into the relentless torments of his characters' wasted talents and lives.<br/><br/>The film's first theme is of political nature: life in the ""Workers' Paradise"" of East Germany in the 1980s -- love it or...don't leave it. We are showed how politics can infect -- and potentially destroy -- every aspect of a citizen's life: work, creativity, leisure, intimacy, and even sex. Steering smoothly between the personal and the political arenas, the film shows how destructively the two fields of activities were combined for millions of innocent East Germans. More generally, we are confronted with a basic reality, which is that no matter which country one considers, there are always people in the higher echelons of government who, with the complicity of eager followers, seek to highjack the freedom of the citizens under the pretext of fighting a common internal, but more often external threat. These politicos are motivated by ideologies, private ambitions, greed, stupidity, or ignorance.<br/><br/>The second theme follows from the first: knowledge is power. In its quest to have absolute power over the East German citizens, the government must strive to obtain absolute knowledge of every aspect of their lives -- their thoughts, behavior, intentions, and activities -- at all times. Through this knowledge, the government can act to counter any subversive activities which could challenge and endanger the regime. This is a question of life or death for the government, and it must employ all means possible, spare no efforts, and be vigilant 24/7, in its quest for information.<br/><br/>The film's third theme is a philosophical one: it explicitly shows how an ideology must shut off one's feelings in order to pursue one's goals. The true essence of ideology is the total supremacy of its principle over feelings, and the biggest life challenge is finding the right balance between the two -- between one's ideological principle and one's true feelings -- when confronted with a moral choice.<br/><br/>I would agree with Minister Hempf's statement that ""People don't change."" No matter what happens in a person's life, that person remains true to his or her nature. However, when along the way, one attains the right balance, albeit temporarily, between ideology and feelings, one is said to have ""changed."" In this context Minister Hempf's statement is wrong, and Captain Wiesler does change. As always, there is never only one cause for a change. Wiesler's dramatic change actually begins soon into the story, when he goes to the theater, an unusual diversion for the person so far depicted. This is followed by his growing awareness of Grubitz's opportunistic character, resulting in his old friend occupying a better position in the Stasi than is own. Weisler contends with the arbitrary use of absolute power when he finds out that his mission has more to do with Minister Hempf's sexual urges than with the defense of Socialism. Finally, as he takes over the direction of Operation Lazlo, Wiesler gets exposed to people whom he would usually only have met during an interrogation situation. And as he becomes more and more familiar with every intimate aspect of their lives, Wiesler starts to question his own life. Through these people, he gets exposed to the arts. Although at first he is rather unwilling, even to the point of finally betraying Dreyman, all these things put together make him change, until he finally commits a genuine heroic act.<br/><br/>My only question about this outstanding film, certainly, on all accounts, the best film I have seen in the last few years, is what will von Donnersmarck do for an encore?"

He, though, has had to alter his writings to keep the Party off his back and keep in business, and she has to give herself regularly to a repulsive culture 'boss'.

The story's, and Wiesler's, snapping point comes when the truly nasty Colonel Grubitz (Tukur) verbally tortures a student in the office canteen after hearing his joke about Erich Honecker, East German premier. The tiny seed of doubt is planted in the mind of this perfect automaton. It's, on the face of it, a complex thriller, and the camera-work and overall feel would be well suited to black and white, so 'noir' is it. All the performances are excellent, from the villainous party leaders to the confused neighbour, but it's really Ulrich Muhe's film. The transfiguration from unfeeling loner to all-out mensch is physical. He starts out looking gaunt like a Giacometti 'walker' and ends as a lonesome teddy bear.

The Wall and its architect were toppled almost simultaneously. Wanted for war crimes, unwelcome even in Yeltsin's Russia, Honecker was extradited from Moscow to a now-unified Germany in 1992. Shortly after the onset of his murder trial, for health reasons, he was released to Chile in 1993. At the time, Chile was still protective of aging, bloody former dictators, whether U.S. or Soviet-sponsored.

In Das Leben der Anderen, we get to hear what goes on and who is doing the listening. Translated, The Lives of Others is exactly what it says: it's about the lives of others, someone's life other than yours.<br/><br/>Throughout East Germany in the 70's and 80's, wiretaps and surveillances were placed amongst civilians considered to be a threat to the government. They would interrogate these targets until deemed necessary or when the information they wanted was acquired.<br/><br/>Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is a member of the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany. He and his colleagues suspect a local writer Georg Dreyman of conspiring against the government. Georg and his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland, an actress in Georg's play, live together in harmony. Behind Georg's back, she has been seeing a high ranking government official to keep her name and her husbands ""hush-hush"" so they may live peacefully. All is heard through Wiesler's headphones.<br/><br/>After a 20 minutes sweep of the apartment, all areas of the home are covered. Wiesler's men work swift and efficiently. It is obvious that this is not something new but very routine. In 20 minutes they have managed to find all the necessary locations for their equipment to be placed, work correctly, and be unseen to the untrained eye. Wiesler finds a perfect place for his operations to be located: right above the cozy apartment.<br/><br/>Everything is in place, the pieces aligned, and mikes turned on. Operation ""Lazlo"" as it has been dubbed is ready to go. All they need is to hear one mention of treason and they storm the building and take them away. Easier said then done. Wiesler's friends get involved and so does Wiesler. One element wasn't accounted for in the briefing: compassion.<br/><br/>There are several moments in the film where you feel bad for the people involved. Wiesler is spying on people who he comes to admire and wants to help them. In the opening of the movie, we see him teaching to a class explaining the proper technique to interrogating a person. His ruthless tactics and harshness towards his comrades make him seem almost inhuman. As the film progresses we see more of a compassionate and touched person than before.<br/><br/>Georg and Christa have their own problems and to top it all off, their friends who have been black listed and spied on realize the danger that everyone is in. Their are eyes everywhere and no one knows where, except the only place that is considered a safe haven is Georg's place which ironically is the one being monitored.<br/><br/>Technically it is very sound and very well put together. The editing is flawless, going from the attic with Wiesler listening to Georg's apartment and the actions going on inside. What really makes this fantastic story work is the acting. Brilliant performances from Ulrich Mühe (Wiesler), Sebastian Koch (Georg), and Martina Gedeck (Christa) boost the intensity and drama of the story to a new level. Another standout performance comes from Wiesler's friend, coworker, and overseer of the operation Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz played by Ulrich Tukur.<br/><br/>The power and energy of The Lives of Others stems from the time period that it takes place in. The people are cautious and aware that they might have some unwanted visitors listening in. What is one to do when they can't leave the country but if they stay they are in danger?"

Granted, many hadn't seen the German film yet, however, I think the push that the Spanish fantasy had, while also taking a few technical Oscars in the process, surprised a lot of people. The shock led to numerous movie folk on the internet describing the voting process for that award, how a select group, not the entire Academy, screens the foreign films. Therefore many thought that this more dramatic and adult story was chosen because that group was probably a very pretentious bunch and couldn't in their right mind vote a fantasy film as a winner above it. Whether this is true or not, Buffalo now has the opportunity to see the award winning film for itself, to decide if it was deserving or not. I must say, while I don't think it was better than Pan's I am totally fine with the fact that it won. The Lives of Others is an expertly told thriller, tense throughout, as we never quite know what our protagonist or antagonist will do, or even if they are on opposite sides of the movie's coin to begin with.<br/><br/>We begin the movie with an introduction to Hauptmann Wiesler, (played perfectly by Ulrich Mühe, who you might know from Haneke's original Funny Games), a member of the Stasi who is teaching a class on the tactics of an interrogation, and how you must show no remorse when trying to find out enemies to the State. An old friend of his, who has since risen in the ranks of the government faction more for greed than actually wanting to do right by his superiors, tells him about a new surveillance job that has come up straight from the Minister himself. Wiesler, always a man willing to do what is necessary for the cause he believes in, takes the job and begins watching the accused man's every move. Soon, though, he realizes that this man, while having friends of those with Western loyalties, keeps clean himself when it comes to politics of that persuasion. Instead Wiesler finds that his subject's live-in girlfriend is having an affair, with the Minister no less. This is not a stakeout to find an enemy; his assignment is one to get rid of a man so that his superior may have a woman all to himself. Disillusionment sets in and Wiesler begins to put a series of events into place that only he knows what he wants the result to be. Does he want to punish the Minister for using his power for selfish gains? Or does he want to prove to everyone that he knows what his job is and will show everyone the power he himself wields.<br/><br/>There are some really fantastic moments throughout the film showing the eventually demise of the GDR. Mühe is fantastic as Wiesler and shows his changing opinions and confusion in what it is he is does for the Stasi. What was once a job for the continuation of socialism in East Germany has become a tool of the leaders to use against their people. When Wiesler and his boss friend go to lunch and he sits at a table of lesser rank than his own, his friend says how the captains sit in the back. Wiesler's response of how socialism must start somewhere is so true and biting that his friend can only smirk. These leaders no longer work for the common good of all men, they have received power and they now intend to keep it. From this point on you never can tell which side Wiesler is truly working on.<br/><br/>Mühe is not the only great performance of the film, although his calm stoicism and hidden emotion truly carry it. The subject of his mission, Georg Dreyman, a playwright, is wonderfully done by Sebastian Koch. This role is of a man who has seen his politically outspoken friends be punished for voicing their opinions, and has, as a result, decided to not follow suit. Only when his mentor commits suicide does Dreyman finally decide to do something about the stifling regime in power and help the West see the growing dissent in the East. His girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, is also portrayed with raw emotion by Martina Gedeck. She is caught between love and survival and has gotten herself too deep in both to be able to leave one for the other. Her part is hard to watch because she tries so hard to keep both halves of her life living in harmony, but being too tired and broken to keep the charade going.<br/><br/>I will again say that I really enjoyed this film. The story was intelligently told and professionally acted and directed. I was on the edge of my seat throughout, waiting to see what Wiesler's true intentions were. If the film would have ended at its logical finishing mark, I may have put it in my top ten of 2007. However, what was a fascinating tale of two men slowly realizing their beliefs were incorrect and because of which decide to take the dangerous challenge of doing something about it, becomes a history lesson about the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was the concentrated focus that enthralled me, and once a series of epilogues (2 years later, etc) were tacked on the end, I was totally taken out of the intimacy of the movie. The final shot ends up being so clichéd and safe that, while appropriate, it ends up subverting the rest of the movie's keep-you-guessing mentality. Some things are best left up to the audience's imagination, and a final crossing of paths between the watcher and the subject need not be spelled out."

","I was fortunate enough to see ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" in April last year in Berlin when it was on general German cinematic release. As I find the historical topic of the Stasi and the former country, the DDR (GDR) in general of much interest and fascination, I visited many of the sites mentioned in the film, most notably the former Stasi prison, Neuenschönhausen, now been converted to a museum. I believe the sheer amount of cruelty and brutality the Stasi expelled on its prisoners to be comparable to that of Nazi Germany. The fact of the matter is that today, German people do not talk about the former east block country, in fact, they'd rather regard it more as a joke, laughing about ""Trabant"" cars or Spreewaldgurken, rather than taking it seriously. This film sparked a breath of fresh air and brought back the publicity and respect former East German political prisoners deserve, rather than being laughed at and humoured by the general media as they have done in the past.<br/><br/>To date I've watched this spectacular film five times and have recommended it to dozens of people, it is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest works to come out of German cinema so far in the twenty first century, if not cinema in general. The films actors and cinematography remind us as how much emotional power the medium itself can have on its audience. This film was so good that when the credits rolled up at the end, not one person out of an audience of 250+ people stirred or made a noise. We were that numbed.<br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised to see that DLDA is up for Oscar nomination. Perhaps the academy is not as biased towards Hollywood as I previously thought. Many of my American friends will not get the opportunity to see this film as it is only on ""limited"" release over in the US as of this month. In my experience ""limited"" means that only a very small minority of independent theatres in large cities will carry the film. It is a similar matter here in the UK, although movie theatres are not overtly controlled or monopolised by Hollywood studios as they are in the US.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I haven't really talked in very much detail about the film in question in the review, however, I urge you to watch it. It is gradually climbing the IMDb Top 100 after all. :)"

","THE LIFE OF OTHERS (Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - Germany 2006).<br/><br/>DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN won practically every award it competed for and after it has won the Oscar for best foreign language film, I became a tad suspicious. Most films that won the Academy Award for best foreign language film are usually two-penny tragedies at best or grotesque monstrosities, but since this is the first feature by writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (I couldn't have picked a better name for a Prussian junker), I gathered it must have been the script above anything else that made his effort worth seeing. Sadly, he proves himself more of a decent - if somewhat unimaginative - cinematographer than a writer. The film seems to have been targeted at international audiences with scant knowledge of German history. That's fine by me, if an engaging storyline can make up for the sometimes insultingly obvious remarks some of the characters make about East-West relations or daily life in East Germany. The first half hour is full of over-explanatory comments about day-to-day practices, mostly rehashing Western capitalist clichés and some truly awful jokes, delivered in such an abysmal way (the jokes themselves not being that awful), not even the world's greatest comedian could make it work. Injecting heavy-handed films with humor is never easy. If the film intends to give the audience an idea what day-to-day life was like in the GDR, he did a good job. An almost total absence of colour, excitement or hope.<br/><br/>Stasi officer Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a caricature of German punctuality. When he attends a party in celebration of the latest play by writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), he suggests to his superior officer - also at the party - Dreyman may be flirting with The West as well. Next, he wiretaps Dreyman's apartment and installs himself in an empty attic in the apartment building. Dreyman's supposedly subversive activities were a bit hazy to me and why officer Wiesler commits himself to this case, remains unclear. He doesn't have a life outside his work. I guess the next inevitably constitutes some spoilers.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS AHEAD *** <br/><br/>Years after the Wende, Dreyman is told that his house was wired and his every move was monitored by the Stasi. To my astonishment, he seems completely surprised by this piece of information. How could this be? How could a well-known writer, or any intellectual for that matter, in East Germany, not even assume his every move is being watched? Even cleaning ladies assumed they could be monitored and spied upon. That was the whole essence of life in East Germany. The trauma of East German citizens perennially paranoid of one another. Initially, this seemed the outlook of the film itself, but the only conclusion I could draw was that a) I missed out on some essential piece of information or b)Dreyman's character didn't know. In that case, it would make him pretty dim-witted.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS END *** <br/><br/>The period and feeling of the GDR is well-captured and I must admit, the final denouement of Wiesler walking the streets of Berlin, alone and bereft of any goal in life after the demise of East Germany, was kind of moving, but as a whole, very disappointing.<br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 4/10"

","People, who will choose this movie, should be aware that it is quite real and would provoke quite different feeling, because in my opinion, it is not for ones, who didn't care about the history or actually stand on the opposite benches of some political river. First of all, the movie is not about freedom, but about choices and transitions. It is a very seldom example of hailing and in the same time terrifying the human and not ideas or systems. Simply it is about the Good man and about bad Stasi or DDR. Actually, there is no any innocent in the movie and it's the most absolute recognition that innocent, being not there, being illusion, finally appears in our changing and transitioning, recognizing the value of the others, experiencing their falling down, accelerated by believes, passions and fools and of course viewing yourself through this lens. I strongly believe that the beauty of the is movie is that actually went beyond the script (non intentionally). The play of the actors is breathtaking and will recommend to listen the movie in original (if you can) than the last phrase is so German and dubious..."
"varun_120","9","3","4","7 March 2013"," Undoubtedly, deserved an Oscar
","This film is in my favorite five foreign films list. I was not very much familiar with the background of East Germany. I was shocked to see under what enormous pressure a lot of East Germans had to live. In this film, Georg Dreyman is a dramatist and Christa-Maria Sieland is an actress and his girlfriend. As East German politicians were influenced by Russians, it was considered almost criminal to be associated with West German. And, Georg and Christa and their friends are associated with West side. The Minister of Culture becomes interested in Christa, so the secret service agent Wiesler is instructed to observe and sound out the couple.<br/><br/>And from here the story becomes complicated. The minister of culture just want to sexually exploit Christa, and on one night he succeeds in doing that, he rapes her. Georg understands that she is being followed by people of Minister. Wiesler, a Secret service agent empathizes with both of them and tries to help them but it is very difficult for Wiesler too, to help them.<br/><br/>How, Wiesler sees Georg is a good person and he thinks whatever is done to him is bad. So, he tries to help him. The acting done by everybody is top notch. I have seen Ulrich Mühe before and knew he is a fine actor. Sebastian Koch (Gerog)and Martina Gedeck (Christa)were new to me. I was very impressed with how Sebastian acted. He did a splendid job. And, what can I say about Martina Gedeck, she is drop dead gorgeous even at the age of 45 in this film. <br/><br/>But, once again the best performance is delivered by Ulrich Mühe. His expressions are exceptional in this film. I bumped onto this film when I was searching for best films ever made list on IMDb. I'm glad that I had the chance to view this film. I recommend this film to almost everybody irrespective of political knowledge and background of German partition and later their reunification. This is one of those films which are not be missed."
"andreaskurniadi","10","3","4","6 January 2013"," One of German movies at its best. Highly Recommended!
","Bought the title on blu-ray 6 months ago because the movie got great rating and reviews, but just now I have finished watching the movie. And I feel very regret why not watching the movie the first the time I bought it.<br/><br/>The movie is really amazing and might touch your heart a little, if not very much. The story about a German secret police officer, Wiesler, who brilliantly played by Ulrich Mühe. He is given a surveillance job by his superior to keep an eye and write a report consisting every single detail of the activities of Dreyman, a very famous stage writer and his beautiful girlfriend, Sieland. The Government of East Germany suspect him (Dreyman) of being pro communist. But in the end, Wiesler found out that he is innocent and feel there is an ugly conspiracy behind this surveillance that involves Dreyman, Sieland, and Minister Hempf.<br/><br/>This movie is worth-watching and no doubt that this has won many awards because the script is well written and the direction from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who did a magnificent job in his first feature. You just can not take your eyes away from the beginning until the unexpected ending.<br/><br/>The movie is highly recommended!"

","I cant remember a more well thought out, intelligently observed and subtle screenplay, Hollywood take note here, people like to see smart films.<br/><br/>I heard in his commentary florian said it took him 3 years to write the screenplay and I can say why. The thought behind it is rigorous and many points are taken care of wherein in other screenplays they are rushed or covered in illogical steps from A to B.<br/><br/>The ink stain is a genius touch and something it so simple but yet so beautiful at the same time. <br/><br/>The shame is Florian ruined his reputation slight with his follow up but I'm positive he will come back with a piece of work that will take him to the heights of this film.<br/><br/>A first class effort."
"Imdbidia","9","3","4","12 February 2011"," A German movie about what does mean to be free
","This is the story of the wiretapping performed on a successful writer and his actress wife suspected of being involved in subversive thinking, writing and activities, by spies from the Stasi Espionage Corps in Socialist Germany.<br/><br/>This is the story of a good man and how acts of kindness make a difference in other's people lives. This is a story that shows that 1- freedom of artistic expression allows Society to progress and evolve. 2- You cannot judge a book by its cover. 3- Sometimes you have to take action, do something, to save other people's lives, and by doing so, redeem yourself from your sins. 4- Our intimate and personal life is directly connected to what happens in Society and Politics, even if we sometimes forget something that simple (and important).<br/><br/>The leading actors who play the Captain of the Stasi (Ulrich Muehe), writer Georg Dreyman and his actress wife Christa-Maria(Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck) are OK in their respective roles, although this is a movie in which the story and its message weights more than the actors performance. However, some of the supporting actors are terrific.<br/><br/>My only little complain is that the change of mind of Capt. Captain Wiesler isn't properly explained, and, realistically speaking, seems improbable that such a thing could happen, especially because this sort of people would be ice-cold and brainwashed. What triggered that change seems not explicitly explained in the film, although subtitles are sometimes very misleading and the original dialogs give specific details. To me, there is a double explanation for his change of mind. 1/ the honesty and principles of others (in this case, of the writer) change those who don't believe in anything or anybody (in this case the leading spy). 2/ The power of Literature (and of the freedom to chose what to read)on the human spirit - the prohibited books that he start reading move him and produce his inner unlocking and liberation.<br/><br/>The movie is slow, with an in-crescendo tempo that keeps you glued to your seat. It is very personal and intimate, but also very political and social. The mood is terrific and the ending superb."

Starting from the storyline to casting to direction to the ending that will leave you feeling so sympathetic about the people involved in the film.<br/><br/>Cast wise, just brilliant. Obviously, any non-German will find no recognizable face. But what a job each of them delivers. The primary cast is so awesome; making everyone takes notice of their immense talent.<br/><br/>The entire atmosphere of the film is very sordid, making the overall feel more realistic considering the theme of the movie. The way the story unfolds is so splendidly captured by the Director, that even at a running time of more than 2 hours, one never stop feeling for the characters. The score perfectly pitches to the sordid atmosphere.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a must watch film. It's terrible that such movies need Awards and Recognitions before being noticed.

"jboothmillard","9","3","4","6 March 2010"," The Lives of Others
","First I found out that this was in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and then I found out it won the Best Foreign Language Oscar instead of Pan's Labyrinth, so I had to see why. Basically it is 1984, where in East Germany, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (BAFTA nominated Ulrich Mühe) is a skilled interrogator assigned by his superior Lt. Col. Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to bug the house of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his long term partner, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). At first Grubitz disagrees that Georg is worth ""watching"", well, there are things that should be heard, but he still agrees to go along with it. It turns out though that Grubitz, forced at first to listen to them, becomes fascinated by the conversations of Georg and Christa-Maria, he doesn't want to be substituted. Soon though Georg becomes even more interesting when it turns out there is a reason to be listening, but Grubitz is the only one hearing it, so he is writing false information on the audio surveillance log, and checking it out himself. It becomes really intense when Georg does something really big, and Christa-Maria has to be interrogated by Grubitz, and soon after commits suicide for betrayal. In the end, Georg finds out about the surveillance ripping all the wires, and he finds Grubitz's logs, and in appreciation, his recent playwright work gets a thank you message written to Grubitz, which he of course buys. Also starring Thomas Thieme as Minister Bruno Hempf, Hans-Uwe Bauer as Paul Hauser, Volkmar Kleinert as Albert Jerska, Matthias Brenner as Karl Wallner, Charly Hübner as Udo and Herbert Knaup as Gregor Hessenstein. I will say I really wish that Pan's Labyrinth won the Oscar instead, but I can see some reasons why this film beat it, it is quite an engaging near comedic at times drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated for Best Director for Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck, Best Film and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!"
"bt-wells99-1","9","3","4","22 February 2010"," One of the best films of the last decade
","I've read this film compared to Coppolla's The Conversation, both favourably and unfavourably, on the discussion boards here. It should be noted that the two films bear only superficial similarities, mainly that the protagonists are middle-aged surveillance operatives who get involved with a case.<br/><br/>However the styles are very different. The Conversation is a classic, and magnificent, piece of 1970s US paranoia-thriller, the best kind of film which came out of Hollywood in that decade of scandal that signified for many, the death of the American dream. Das Leben der Anderen is an equally intelligent and artful film, but one (from what I can gather) typical of modern German cinema, drenched in a sadness about its past, featuring strong themes of divided loyalties and moral dilemmas, but hopeful (unlike Coppola's film) about the future. Less suspenseful and pacey than The Conversation, this is a tale that gives a human face to the victims of the Stasi in East Germany, and, although it keeps you on the edge of your seat, is more of a drama, more sentimental in tone.<br/><br/>A wonderful film, its magic is in the feeling it generates in you for its characters, and the almost gentle tragedy that unfolds. A serious, well made and superbly (that should be underlined: superbly) acted film that isn't ashamed to tug at the heartstrings a little. Small wonder it won the Oscar for best film of 2006: I can't imagine a better film was made anywhere that year."
"benjamin_lappin","10","3","4","8 February 2010"," The Lives Of Others Will Greatly Affect Yours
","The film writing and directorial debut of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives Of Others) is a German drama set in East Berlin in the last years of Communism in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Telling the tale of an artistic couple being continually watched, recorded and filmed by members of the ""Stasi"", the East German secret police, as he is suspected of creating subversive plays undermining the state and she is lusted after by a highly ranked official. Successfully nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Film"", ""The Lives Of Others"" is a highly moral and politically charged film that will demand as much emotion and choice from its audience as it does from its protagonists. <br/><br/>While the directorial cinematography is lush and crisp, with ""Donnersmarck"" using subtle tones of greys and greens to emphasis the drab, bleak existence in East Germany it is the characterisation within the film that makes this such an engaging and emotional experience. The cast is led superbly by Ulrich Muhe who delivers a stunning performance as ""Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler"" who is charged with leading the investigation into the alleged deviants. He is backed up exceptionally by Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch as ""Christa-Maria Sieland"" and ""Geog Dreyman"", respectively, who provide the necessary emotional tension to pull entrap the audience. With all three of these performances, each has to deal with and convey different emotions on their moralistic standpoints, in differing fashions when their whole lives are threatened. Muhe finds himself increasingly involved and engrossed by the drama that is the lives of those he is watching, he finds his unwavering dedication to the Stasi to be brought into question when his reasoning is brought into doubt. Through watching and listening to the idealistic principles of the artistic couple beneath him, doubt slowly creeps into his conscious and he must begin to make a decision as to whether he can continue to justify harming the lives of innocent individuals. Sieland and Dreyman, however, must decide whether they can continue to live their lives as lies, will they sacrifice their artistic freedom to avoid persecution and interference from the state. ""The Lives Of Others"" skillfully leads us down their respective paths as we watch with hope, fear and trepidation at the choices they make.<br/><br/>What separates ""The Lives Of Others"" from contemporary dramas of the same styling is the subtlety with which the script has been written and the delivery of those underpinning emotions by the actors. The director builds up immense tension from scenes where very little action is taking place, whether it's Muhe simply listening to a telephone conversation through his headphones or Dreyman hiding a typewriter, Donnersmarck ratchets up the heart rate with such delicate ease. Each of the main protagonists delivers their own unique style of performance to enhance the enclosed feel of the investigation. Gedecks' ""Sielands"" fall from grace is a harrowing and heart breaking affair, as the demure and regal persona falls to reveal a fractured and pained woman, desperately fighting to save her acting career. Koch's ""Dreyman"" is almost the reversal of his female counterpart, starting off as somewhat of a shell, kowtowing to his communist masters yet internally yearning to express himself as he would want. His increased risky disposition is taken under the naive belief that the state have not got him under surveillance which of course leaves everything in the confused hands of Wiesler. From cold, hard calculating man who claims ""the best way to establish guilt...is non-stop interrogation"" to having to question himself as a human being, Wiesler's journey is the keystone which holds the rest in place and Muhe's understated motions of raising an eyebrow here to pursing his lips tell so many stories of his internal strife and is an absolute joy to behold. <br/><br/>""The Lives Of Others"" is an exceptional film that is not merely worthy of 2007's ""Best Foreign Film"" Academy Award but of claims that it is perhaps not simply the greatest film of that year, but of the decade as a whole. It in itself is an absolute joke that this and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" weren't in the ""Best Picture"" category regardless of their origins, because the skill with which the director and his cast weave their intricate web and have you riveted as an audience, is an art form to never grow tired of. Donnersmarck's debut is a thoroughly engaging affair that highlights not just European cinema, but cinema as a whole. It is a life affirming experience that will warm your heart and bring a tear to your eye, it will have you utterly entranced for its duration and will leave a mark on your character. The tale of others' lives, their strife, their desires, their wants and their dreams is an experience that will greatly affect yours."
"MoneyMagnet","9","3","4","21 January 2010"," Achingly real
","Usually when people call a film a ""modern classic,"" they are not really thinking of the old classics at all. But if it would have been possible to make this film back in Hollywood's Golden Age, it would likely have starred the legendary actors of the day, and would have taken its place in our memory along with the greatest classic films Hollywood has produced. It is that great of a story and that fine of a film experience, speaking to the human condition in the involving way that the great films used to do...<br/><br/>And yet it was not possible to make this film until our own film era, because it deals with the recent (though receding) past of Communist East Germany. One gets the sense when watching ""The Lives of Others"" that this is THE last great cinematic summation of the pains and passions of the Cold War era. Many great movies about the Cold War era have been made, but somehow this one feels more achingly real than all the rest... not an ironic/comic shrug or a savage political critique, but a measured cry from the heart that gives lasting meaning to the very real sufferings of one nation's people (and any of us who lived through the Cold War, wherever we were).<br/><br/>Others have already noted the tremendous performances and the marvelous screenplay, the haunting musical score and moving final scenes, so there is no need for me to repeat this, except to say along with others: See this movie."

","Set in East Berlin in the mid-1980's -- ""The Life of Others"" in the version shown in the United States -- this film comes closer to bringing Orwell's terrifying satire to life than any other picture I've seen about life behind the Iron Curtain. A free-thinking but cautious playwright, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), is targeted by the Stasi, the notorious East German secret police, because a powerful minister, Hempf (Thomas Thieme), wants to have the noted actress and Dreyman's live-in girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), available to him sexually whenever he wants. A Stasi officer, Gerd Wiesler, (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned by his superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), the task of wiring Dreyman's apartment and collecting the necessary incriminating evidence. Interplay between Hempf, Grubitz, and Wiesler displays a menacing hierarchical relationship while Dreyman goes about his business believing he is free of suspicion. Meanwhile, Ms. Sieland is under direct pressure from oily Minister Hempf to surrender her body as the price of being allowed to perform her craft. Wiesler's growing sympathy for Ms. Sieland and for Dreyman seems highly improbable and the outcome is melodramatic -- but it is a movie, after all, and improbabilities and melodrama are coin of the realm. The writer and director, Florian Henckel von Donnenmarck, deserves all the honors he won for this film, including a best foreign film Oscar"

"gilgamesh-1985","9","3","4","3 October 2009"," A morality tale about human dignity: THE LIVES OF OTHERS
","It was hard to live on the other side of the wall in East Berlin in the Deutsche Demokratische Republik, the German Democratic Republic, better known as DDR. Hard in a country where freedom of expression is inevitably challenged by a bully seeking to threaten any form of legitimacy. Be the least suspected of going against the party, could jeopardize their lives forever. The price was very high, and especially for intellectuals was living in this suffocating atmosphere of constant tension, as people of culture were the most frequently considered as possible conspirators. Proponent of this disturbing ""McCarthyism backwards"" was the Stasi, the state police, which with its numerous agents scattered throughout the morbidly crept into the lives of others, collecting fragments of everyday life, the frantic search for subtle clues that can can destroy a life, isolating indefinitely. This is the work you do Gerd Wiesler, the Stasi captain unyielding, icy eyes and attitude severe. One day he is ordered to spy on the famous writer George Dreyman at his home, as it may be a dissident. Wiesler then from his position of control begins to take the role of interlocutor. The first feature of the novice Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck is an undisputed masterpiece. It is primarily a film for his unsettling topicality. In times like this where the violation of privacy is relentless oppression, ""The Lives of Others"" is necessary to shake the conscience. A crude metaphor concerning contamination spreads to levels paroxysmal, like wildfire as a terrible epidemic: the Stasi through its microscopic settlements. Parasite. Inanimate being able to take nourishment only through the domination of living organisms immersed in their peaceful habitat. A constant threat, active and never worn. ""The Lives of Others"" is an intense film, realistic and never redundant: very good Henckel Von Donnersmarck that propels us into a specific historical context, never a show those events, unlike other directors who use history to romanticize silly fiction. ""The Lives of Others"" has the great merit of calligraphy are never, even in the final sequence after the collapse of the wall, nor ever falls into rhetoric. Directed lucid and simple (absent virtuosity space fields, reverse shot, extreme close-ups important) ensure an atmosphere of unrelenting coldness to the film, in full harmony with the troubled air that you breathe in those years. Prey to paranoia, uncontrollable, incurable physical and psychological abuse, the man conscious of no longer master of himself, he tries to put a stop to all this: that is Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe that provides an extraordinary eye) tired subjection of psychology and existential bleakness which is limited, based on pre-cooked meals and embraces a fee, he decided to change was a turning point in his life, taking a key role within the situation. ""The Lives of Others"" is a morality tale about human dignity, the tangible proof that despite the abuse that a totalitarian regime imposes humanity of the individual surfaces, and the burden of consciousness has a decisive role, because a dictatorship can annihilate the mind and body, but not the soul. The essence of ourselves involves the consequences of actions we do. Excellent screenplay never verbose, striking suspense that never falls in rhythm, exceptional performers. And in the end, in the blue eyes of Wiesler once menacing but now full of goodness, finally glimpsed a glimmer of hope and redemption for mankind. Moving."

"EUyeshima","9","3","4","23 September 2007"," Suspenseful, Nuanced Character Study Puts a Spotlight on a Little Known Aspect of the Cold War
","Five long years before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was at the height of its infiltrative power with one in every fifty citizens cooperating with them in sniffing out any scent of political dissidence. To the Western world, it's a relatively unknown piece of Cold War history, but the Stasi's repressive force permeated all aspects of German society. First-time director and screenwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmark makes a most auspicious debut with this mesmerizing, epic-length 2006 study of the Stasi's devastating impact on a trio of characters in pre-glasnost East Berlin.<br/><br/>The protagonist is Captain Gerd Wiesler, who is initially a rigid, humorless master of relentless, soul-baring interrogation techniques highly prized by the regime. He seems so utterly uncompromising that one would have expected a story to evolve that is closer in spirit to a classic Cold War espionage thriller like John LeCarre's The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. However, von Donnersmark digs deeper into the conflicted psyche of this seemingly Machiavellian character by placing him in a situation where he is constantly monitoring the activities of renowned playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, in their shared apartment.<br/><br/>Although Dreyman has shown no signs of defying the current regime, Wiesler is ordered by his old classmate Grubitz, now the head of the Stasi's Culture Department, to put the couple under surveillance. What then evolves as the plot thickens is an unspoken bonding of spirits among Wiesler, Dreyman and Sieland as the inherent contradictions between artistic and political expression become more and more pronounced. Wiesler becomes disillusioned when he realizes that the motivation for monitoring the artistic couple is Minister Hempf's unsavory interest in Sieland. Meanwhile, Dreyman ironically does have his political consciousness raised after his blacklisted playwriting mentor kills himself. What transpires is surprising yet most fitting.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly solid beginning with Ulrich Mühe's implosively searing portrayal of Wiesler. For the most part, it's a subtle turn highlighted by powerfully cathartic moments such as his response to Dreyman's playing of a piece called ""Sonata for a Good Man"". It does beg comparisons to Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola's classic surveillance thriller, The Conversation. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are equally riveting as the conflicted Dreyman and the increasingly desperate Sieland, who haltingly faces her own dilemma of betrayal. Adding immeasurably to the fatalistic, Orwellian atmosphere that von Donnersmark creates are Gabriel Yared's evocative music (including the beautiful sonata) and Hagen Bogdanski's burnished cinematography.<br/><br/>The one drawback is the 137-minute length, which I found slightly excessive, especially toward the end, for the relatively intimate story being told. The filmmaker provides an informative and often enthusiastic commentary track on the 2007 DVD, though most of the major points are captured in the half-hour featurette, ""Interview with Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark"". There is also a twenty-minute making-of short which includes interviews with the producers and principal cast, as well as eight deleted scenes."
"DarthVoorhees","10","3","4","22 September 2007"," A thought provoking and brilliant film
","In the last chapters of the Cold War the infamous Stasi begin to investigate a writer who could be considered the ideal Socialist. They don't believe his intentions. The East German government assigns Captin Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler to tap the wires of playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover Christa Marie Sieland's apartment. Wiesler is a pitiful character who has no life to begin with. He is the ideal Stasi, during a lecture his students at the beginning of the film we see cut aways to a brutal interrogation scene. This case is different for Wiesler though, for some reason he finds himself intrigued by Dreyman. He begins to wonder if he truly believes in Socialism. and when Dreyman writes a critical article dealing with East Germany's suicide epidemic, Wiesler leaves the traitorous news out of the report. He becomes entangled between the government and his morals.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others is a powerful film. It isn't preachy in it's political commentary, it's straight forward and these characters are people who have real convictions and emotions. I didn't find it to be political at all in the long run, sure it deals with communism but it is at heart a morality tale. Ulrich Muhe delivers an absolutely outstanding performance as Wiesler. Wiesler is a complex character and from someone who doesn't understand a word of German I thought he gave one of the best performances of last year. His face and voice deliver great complexity and emotion. There is a terrific scene when Wiesler confronts a young boy in the elevator to his apartment. The boy brags about how his dad says the Stasi are bad men who just arrest people. The responding look on Muhe's face delivered more insight into this character's soul than any dialog ever could.It really made me sad to learn that Ulrich died recently. If his performances were mostly on the level of The Lives of Others,I'd suspect he was one of Germany's master actors. Director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck gives the film a dark feel. The camera work is nothing special but the mood established by the film is enough to warrant him special praise as a great future up and coming director. The Lives of Others is one of the most important films of the new millennium. It was the rightful choice to win the Oscar over the much more popular Pan's Labyrinth. For those who tend to stay away from foreign films, you are making a big mistake if you choose to miss out on this masterpiece."

","These comments relate to a DVD rental. This is undoubtedly an incredibly well crafted film with an excellent musical score. The special features include an impressive presentation by the Director on the making of the film and his spoken English is evidently flawless. However after thirty minutes or so of watching the film, I stopped it and removed it from my player because of the exasperating inadequacy of the English subtitles. It appears that just about twenty-five percent of the dialog is subtitled and much of the subtitles presented appear to be just summations of what is being spoken rather than word for word translation. For a film of this quality to have such inadequate subtitling is really sad. I realize that reading subtitles and watching a film can be really difficult, but, realizing how much dialog is being missed here is most troubling."

Unlike many thrillers, this film doesn't rely on drawn-out car chases or bloody gun battles, but more so on tense character development and I welt so moved by the film, I literally thought there would be members of the Stasi creeping up behind me while watching the film.<br/><br/>Florian Donnersmark's film, which was awarded an Oscar for best foreign film, is about a member of the secret police named Captain Wiesler who listens into people he believes to be enemies.

The late Ulrich Muhe does a wonderful job as Captain Wiesler and all his scenes were just perfection. In fact, the final scene he is in should be enough to move you to tears. Sebastian Koch does a great job as Georg Dreyman, a playwright who is also bent on escaping over the Wall.<br/><br/>Overall, The Lives of Others is a very well-made thriller that will teach you about the lifestyle of people back then and how the citizens had to live in fear. There are no car chases here, but there is an actual story that is worth checking out. These kind of slow-burners are the best thrillers of them all and this made for an engaging thriller.

"Milo_Milosovic","9","4","6","8 April 2014"," The Lives of Others
","Is it possible for a man to be good if he's part of a bad system? This is just one of the many questions raised by the 2006 Oscar Winner for best foreign language film. Set In 1984 East Berlin, Gerd Wiesler is an agent of the Stasi. A good one. So good he conducts lectures on interrogation techniques of enemies of the state. He's tasked with an assignment to monitor Georg Dreyman, an influential playwright with on the surface seems a poster-child of the GDR.<br/><br/>What unfolds is a thoughtful and thought-provoking drama. Wiesler observes not only his target but the nature of the system he works for. His observation, near silent most of the time, reveals not only the complexities of Dreyman's personal life and political beliefs but also the corruption of a system he holds steadfastly to be perfect. It's a beautifully profound human drama that asks suitably profound questions. Can bad acts be legitimised if the perpetrator believes them to be inherently good? Can art be true without the freedom of expression? What are the limits of loyalty? The performances are uniformly excellent. Ulrich Mühe shines as the torn Stasi officer. Playing him as a blank canvas reflecting the world around him yet wrestling with his own loneliness. While Martina Gedeck is excellent as the tragic and trapped actress whose relationship with Dreyman is stretched to breaking point.<br/><br/>The film is subtle, observant and never feels the need to over-state it's key argument about the corruptive and corrosive effect of the Stasi on the GDR. Yet, the historical and political trappings are a framework to a touching human drama that works on almost all levels. Outstanding."

Before the Berlin Wall fell, Stasi conducted surveillance on anyone they suspected of harboring thoughts and opinions against the Communist rule of Eastern Germany. We follow a man employed by the DDR to listen in on a specific household, and how he gradually becomes emotionally attached to these two people that he, unbeknownst to them, is recording the actions of. This gives a psychological and realistic look at not only the people who are the subject of a constant invasion of privacy, but also those who are responsible for it. There is tremendous authenticity, in this. It is dramatic, engaging, suspenseful, and, frankly, beautiful. The plot is excellent, and develops rather well. This has spot-on pacing, and it's never boring. The acting is beyond reproach, every single performance in this is stunning. All of the music and score fits. The writing is incredible, the credibility, the characters, the dialog, the scenes... I could go on. Since I only followed what was said from the subtitles, I cannot comment on whether or not there is harsh language in this.

"nturner","10","4","6","8 November 2008"," A Vivid Reminder
","I begin this review by quoting Jesse Vint III. Mr. Vint is a character actor seen in numerous films and television programs. Of The Lives of Others, he states, ""This film slowly gripped me, but by the end, the grip was merciless."" I couldn't have said it better. That's why I am borrowing Mr. Vint's words. As a matter of fact, when I first started watching this film, I was thinking that it wasn't going to be worth over two hours of my time. I soon discovered that it is worth far more. It turned out to be a deeply personal experience for me as it reminded me of certain shattering events in my own life. I actually had nightmares last night relating to those events which, I'm sure, were aroused by viewing this extraordinary film set in East Germany a few years before the fall of The Wall.<br/><br/>The element of the film that caused me to continue to watch even though I first thought that I was not going to be entertained was the depiction of the lead character, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler played by Ulrich Mühe. Mühe's interpretation of a man who appears totally devoid of emotion is hypnotic. The character Wiesler is an officer in the Stasi - the secret police in charge of following the movements and activities of every person the country.<br/><br/>The Stasi employed some 100,000 people to keep track of some 16 million citizens. In addition, the Stasi had a huge network of unpaid informers reporting the activities of their friends and neighbors. Imagine - one person to spy upon and report the lives of just sixty people. Horrifying! Mühe is an actor who grew up in East Germany and was the victim of both the Stasi and ""friends"" who were informers. That surely had to add to his insight into the character of Wiesler, but whatever his resources, his performance is surely one of the finest ever recorded on film. Wiesler is a man so imbued with Communistic doctrine and devotion to the state that he has become an observation and interviewing machine more than a man. There is a revealing scene early in the film in which Wiesler summons a prostitute to his house. He sits on his sofa with his shirt buttoned to the top, trousers and belt still fastened, while the prostitute plies her trade - machine sex. The only hint of any human emotion is at the end when he buries his head in her ponderous breasts. At this point in the film is when I began to feel sorry for this pitiful man rather than hate him for what he does.<br/><br/>Wiesler is assigned to observe a famous playwright who has always openly supported the government - but why? We find that Wiesler's superior is having an affair with the lover of the playwright - a beautiful and famous stage actress - and wants the playwright out of the way. The motive behind the observation goes totally against the principles to which Wiesler has devoted his life and career. Thus we see a seed planted that will grow to change the life of this man. That change takes place as he observes the lives of others.<br/><br/>Along with this totally breathtaking film, the DVD contains features which truly enrich the viewing experience. Through these features, the viewer is treated to the history of the research that went into the film, the writing process, the historic locations, and the thoughts of the actors. They are not to be missed.<br/><br/>If you are reading this review, you probably have an interest in film. As a film viewer, you must see The Lives of Others."

","The Lives of Others (2006)<br/><br/>Top 2 - 2006<br/><br/>After watching Das Leben der Anderen, I realised that so many exceptional films must be made around the world that go unnoticed. The only reason I watched this is because it gained recognition by winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; so many films go unnoticed and it is at least good that some magnificent pictures like this gain some recognition. I believe that this film should have also been included in the 'Best Picture' category (not to go as far as suggest that this is perhaps the Best Film of the Year!) <br/><br/>The Lives of Others is a story about the brutal measures that the Stasi (East German Secret Policy) went to, to maintain absolute control over its population in the 80s. <br/><br/>Wiesler, a cold calculating interrogator, is assigned to monitor the lives of a playwright and his actress girlfriend. As he examines every detail of their lives, Wiesler realises how cold and colourless his life is and ultimately puts his life on the line to protect the couple. <br/><br/>This film is a credit to German film-making as well as international cinema. This is a serious, extremely well made film examining the complex and turbulent history of post World War Germany, a country that was divided in two contrasting halves. <br/><br/>The direction is fine, delivering each scene tightly, the acting is very good, especially from Ulrich Muhe. <br/><br/>A harrowing and often terrifying psychological and political thriller, which definitely ranks as one of the finest films of recent years. A fascinating study of humanity and the brutal regimes of Europe in the darkest Century in history.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Not too many films get full marks from me but The Lives of Others does. Its one of those rare films that lives up to and exceeds the hype, creating fascinating characters you will always remember and has moments of great power and beauty.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others is set in communist-ruled, Stasi controlled East Germany. A powerful politician wants to bring down a popular 40-year old writer who is respected by his peers and recognised and accepted by the intolerant State apparatus. The politicians motive is a woman who he lusts after and who loves the writer. The film is a fascinating insight into the way the Stasi operates - the wiretapping, secret camera, phone-tapping etc. that fascist regimes used against their own citizens. The sober nature of the subject matter, the authentic look of East Germany created by the director and the excellent cast were enough to make this a very good film and well-deserved Oscar winner. But what makes this a classic is the end. I won't reveal it and I know its drawn criticism from some IMDb users, but I found it to be very intelligent and subtle in the way the film closes. It reminded me of another lovely film - Majid Majidi's Baran."

","The German award winning The Lives of Others, which focuses on the Secret Police/ or Stassi of the former East Germany. From beginning to end, I have to say that I was just blown away. Everything is just perfectly blended together, the acting, directing, the script.<br/><br/>At it's core, The Lives of Others is really about examing one's own humanity. Ulrich Mühe plays the lead character, Wiesler who finds himself not only questioning his mission, but also his 'cause.' The fact, that the people he is orderered to spy on are just normal people-people who have really no real threat-beings to break his foundation. What makes his character interesting, is that his change doesn't just come out of nowhere, but as the viewer you really do start to see these subtile little changes. For instance, the greatest example I could give is that scene in the elevator with the young boy.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others succeeds, because in the end-it makes you think about the particular situations these people are in. Who they are, and what they can ( take the politician character, Minsiter Hempf) and can't do, or not able or willing to do. The scenes involving the artist/playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch)& his girlfriend, the actress Christa-Maria ( Martina Gedeck) are just fantastic. Especially........................."

"pikhal020","10","4","6","9 September 2007"," Riveting and stunning film
","Wow, what an incredible experience. This German film is a dazzling document of the end days to a dark chapter in the human experiment. It is intelligent, suspenseful, claustrophobic and above all, profoundly moving in a manner that is devoid of cheap sentimentality and refreshingly understated. The cinematography and dialogue often seem inspired by the film noir of Fritz Lang and others. The performances, all from veteran German actors of film and stage, are convincing and haunting. 1984 East Germany is brilliantly recreated in its architecture, fashions and soundtrack. Not only does the movie convey the incredibly sad and pointless destruction of so many wasted lives under a corrupt totalitarian regime, but at its core, depicts the gradual disillusionment of its central character, a Stasi true believer, as he painfully reclaims his humanity at immense personal cost to his life and career. The ending rings true and is not in the superficially overdone style of too much of what comes out of Hollywood these days. This film left me under its spell for days after I watched it. I look forward to seeing it again and again. Its amazing that this is the director's first film and it richly deserved the foreign film Oscar and other accolades it has won. Highly recommended."
"Michael Kenmore","10","4","6","18 August 2007"," I belatedly came to see this movie knowing nothing about the plot. Mesmerizingly acted and strangely moving.
","When my father visited me on a trip, we are obliged to go to the movies.<br/><br/>The problem was there are no interesting movies in the month of May. Hollywood productions are slick with the emphasis on visual eye candy (like Spider-Man 3). We opted to see The Lives of Others when it came up on the Yahoo Movies theatre listing, remembering having heard the movie won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.<br/><br/>As I have commented on that other nominated movie previously, Pan's Labyrinth lost the Oscar, deservedly because of its repulsive horror content. Contrast a morbid historical fantasy movie emphasizing the evils of Fascism to an evenly paced and tightly plotted movie that sent the genuine shock wave ripple effect to the movie lovers who desperately wanted Mexican director Guellermo del Toro to grab an Academy Award at last. I honestly expected Pan's Labyrinth to win the coveted prize, but I was nonetheless pleased with the outcome even though I never heard of The Lives of Others.<br/><br/>I kept missing the movie for a couple months because of busy schedule. Then it disappeared in mid-April. I was dismayed that I would have to wait for video. But when my father came over to visit me, the movie popped up unexpectedly on the theatre listing for the last-chance one-week engagement. I had never heard of a movie *returning * to the theatre nearly a month after the initial run, so I thought it might be a must-see.<br/><br/>I refuse to explain what the movie is about. That's not only redundant but for an excellent reason. My father and I came in knowing *nothing* about the basic plot except that it won an Oscar. The lack of pre-screening knowledge contributed to one of the best cinematic experiences my father and I had ever experienced. The screening was nearly packed with older moviegoers and I was surprised to see younger high school and college-age boys and girls. I thought American young people don't even bother to see a foreign language movie with English subtitles because of their natural predisposition to avoid any movie that have English subtitles requiring them to read, much to their irritation. Apocalypto is another movie like that, but The Lives of Others is a heavy drama and I found it very unorthodox that young people would bother to see the movie unless they take German language class for credits.<br/><br/>When the ending was concluded on a grand note, it moved the whole audience to lump throat and tears. I had not seen this widely affecting reaction since Titanic. We had misty eyes but resisted tears to drop only because we didn't bring Kleenex. The fact that it's not only well-made in structure, pacing and cinematography but also feature the finest ensemble acting in a long time is a testimony to the artistic expression of cinema that is both entertaining and profound. The Lives of Others is almost neo-realist to an extent that the audience feel empathy for the few characters.<br/><br/>Ulrich Mühe, the German equivalent of Kevin Spacey, gave one of the best male performances ever captured on film. This is not a single-minded praise. I have seen very few performances that are astonishingly in-depth in raising the bar of acting to impossible heights. Wonderful examples are Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot and Gangs of New York; Peter Finch as Howard Beale in Network; Russell Crowe in The Insider; Warren Oates in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia; Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs and Peter Sellers in Being There. Ulrich deserves a memorial in cinematic history for the incredible broad range of tight expression in nuanced facial and body language not usually achieved since the Silent era.<br/><br/>I highly recommend The Lives of Others; there's no other words to describe the experience I had watching the movie in the screening. It's pure cinema magic that is so rare in philosophically profound movie-going experience one may experience it once every decade.<br/><br/>William F. Buckley, Jr, the editor in chief of the right-wing magazine National Review, wrote a column that commend the aesthetic and artistic quality of the movie by stating it's the best movie he had ever seen. Normally I am aversive to radical right-wing ideologues, but this time I agree with William's view.<br/><br/>The movie is R rated for nudity and sex scenes, but it's such a profoundly moving picture that I urge my strictly conservative mother, who despise R-rated movies because of vulgar content she find abhorrent, and she agreed to view the movie after the arrival of the video release. I never recommend R-rated movies to my mother with the sole exception of Dancer in the Dark, but The Lives of Others have won my respect enough to recommend to her.<br/><br/>**** out of 4"
"Mithras-4","10","4","6","16 August 2007"," One of the best movies in recent years... And more than simply a drama about the Stasi secret service...
","In April 2006, a friend of mine asked me if i'd join her to watch ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" at the movies. I didn't quite know what this movie was really about, i only knew it dealt with the Stasi secret service in the former GDR, an historical topic which is still discussed controversial and emotionally in present-day Germany.<br/><br/>After the end titles appeared on the screen i realized that i had not only seen that year's best movie, but also IMO one of the best movies in recent years! I watched 4 more times (convincing other friends of mine to join me at the movies) and now it's of my favourite moves ever... <br/><br/>I was struck by the atmosphere, the brilliant acting (especially the great (and sadly late) Ulrich Muehe) and the compelling storytelling and directing of Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck (what a name! But one i'll keep on my radar...) and its' message...<br/><br/>I felt that this movie was more than simply a ""Stasi movie"" as it is often described. Even more it's a moral play about being human (under inhuman conditions). It shows how a totalitarian system dehumanizes its people - no matter if they are pro or contra the regime. But it also reminds me about how people even in the so-called ""free world"" in the western hemisphere act like opportunists, neglect their freedom of speech and simply follow paroles...<br/><br/>Maybe that's the main reason this movie is understood around the world and not only in Germany. It uses the historical situation of the last years of the GDR to explore how humans behave differently to the same circumstances: You oppose, you follow because of idealism, you sell yourself to the regime or you muddle through as an ""inner emigrant""...<br/><br/>I think that Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck is rooted in Catholicism. He wrote the script for ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" at the Heiligenkreuz Abbey in Austria, which is led by his uncle. And so he shows compassion for the moral struggling by some of his characters - and leaves it to the movie's audience to ask itself how it would have reacted in similar situations. Or how it even behaves today in ""harmless times""... Or knows how to behave like a ""good man""?<br/><br/>""Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression."" (Psalm 19, 12-13)"

Plot is flawless, script is original and written well. Captain Wiesler's character was developed very well, and his relationship to other characters, even though remote, grew to be very personal and intimate. I couldn't help but noticing his resemblance to Kevin Spacey, both physically as well as his expressionless acting style from ""The Usual Suspects"". The movie portrays very well an era just before the fall of the Berlin wall, and how a tough and brutal system affects people's lives. Overall, this is excellent movie, and a must-see for all the non-Hollywood movie lovers. Cheers."

Dreyman is closely monitored by 'Stasi' surveillance operative Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) on the orders of the philandering Minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme) in an abuse of power carefully exacted to destroy the successful couple. <br/><br/>Debut director, von Donnersmarck's 'The Lives of Others' offers an emotional and moving tale of contrasts and oppositions: of observations and secrets, of society and individuality, and his stunning screenplay powers steadily towards its cathartic climax with the measured rhythm of an overnight freight train.

I don't like subtitles. I'm not really attracted to grim films about spying in the former East Germany.<br/><br/>But, hey. ""Lives of Others"" is really excellent, engaging, poignant, thought provoking, unforgettable, with earned moments of beauty and soul. And I laughed several times, too.<br/><br/>Sure, it's set in East Germany, but the characters on screen are so real and so known to you -- I guarantee you've met people like them -- that you'll forget about the foreign setting and just fall into the story.<br/><br/>And it will reward you for doing so.<br/><br/>I can't give it a ten because of its handling of gender. I can't say more or I'd give away plot points. But check out, for example, Vera Wollenberger. Women's role in what lead up to 1989 has been underwritten in post-communist histories. But.

"jzappa","10","4","6","27 March 2007"," Praise
","What an auspicious, overwhelmingly impressive directorial debut this film is. It's difficult to think of any American director, even our finest, who made a true milestone during their first time in the director's chair. The Lives of Others is seamless. The pace of the film is intense, steady, fixated, allowing smaller things, technical situations, difficult to imagine on film, to become riveting moments integrated into the film as a whole. The drama of the movie's story is sternly realized with an almost cold perspective that allows realism that is impartial, though the film's stance is very obvious and clear. The historical detail of the look and feel of East Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall in the 1980s is very bleak and clearly portrayed as such by the impeccable camera. According to a friend who saw this movie with me, who was studying abroad at one point in East Berlin during the time it takes place, the realization of setting and time period is perfectly realistic.<br/><br/>Something about the film that I am personally drawn to is the involvement in the subject matter of intricate plots, intrigue, elaborate schemes, and overall sneakiness, all of which are present in very fulfilling form and perfectly organized within the plot, which still allows great emotion and cinematic voice.<br/><br/>Ulrich Muhe, an actor I've seen in a few of Michael Haneke's films, may seem to many American viewers to be overly stoic and hardly dramatic, but his portrayal of an externally cold, stand-offish introvert of very few words is brilliant. His performance is actually quite a dramatic challenge. The self-control required to play the role with the gradual intensity that he does is a joy to watch, as are the performances of varying degrees of animation, tone, and persona by the rest of the cast, mainly Gedeck, Koch, Tukur, and Thieme.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others is possibly the greatest German film I've seen so far in my life. It is wonderful, surely even for those who aren't familiar with the political matter of the story."

Under the request of his superiors, he investigates a play writer, Georg (Sebastian Koch). Georg's apartment is bugged and he is surveillanced 24/7. Wiesler, a systematic tool of the system and lacking a personal touch in life, joins the Socialist party due to unrealistic ideals - this party is strong and helps the German people. While watching Georg, he is touched by how strong and good this play writer is. Lives of Another portrays how the two effect each other (and hopefully the audience).<br/><br/>The written detail is impressive. There is a scene where Wiesler reads aloud a passage in a book. My memory took me back to English class where the teacher would point out a poem or tangent the author wrote. While trying to explain the relevancy of this ""tangent"", I always felt the writer added this part for filler or to push the story. But in Lives of Another, these little passages, plays, or conversations had relevancy to the characters and carefully planned.

I resided in Venezuela during the iron fisted dictatorship of Marcos Perez Jimenez. Watching this film I kept thinking of the situations I personally witnessed. It was practically impossible to speak to anyone about anything, except maybe the weather forecast. Nothing to taxi drivers - waiters- hair dressers etc..

","The Lives of Others- 2006, Directed by Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck ""People don't change""- Bruno Hempf, Stasi Cultural Minister A film whose beauty cuts through the dismal and stifling political culture of pre-glastnos East Germany. In a nation of 16 million citizens it's estimated that the East German Government actively kept files on 6 million of them, and had up to 400,000 active cooperators at it's height. ""The Lives of Others"" deservedly won the Oscar for best foreign film as well as seven Lola Awards (the German equivalent of the Oscars). It is an astonishing debut from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Nazi Germany has had a multitude of films bring it's crimes to light, yet no other internationally released film has dealt with the sins of communist East Germany and the Stasi (State Security) whom ruled the GDR with an iron grip.<br/><br/>Gerd Wiesler (Ulhric Muhe) is a Stasi Captain assigned the task of leading a surveillance team to monitor the popular and relatively a-political writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). The two men are of stark contrast. Wiesler lives alone, in a cold sterile apartment, he is an agent so painstaking and calculated that he can carry out an order down to the click of a stopwatch. Dreyman is passionate, warm, deep surrounded by those who love him. He and his girlfriend are unique in that they command the respect of the general public, intellectuals and government officials alike.<br/><br/>Georg soon becomes more and more dissatisfied not because of intellectual conviction but because the government brings pressure upon his loved ones. His long time friend and producer Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) is marginalized into obscurity and suicide, his talented girlfriend is being coerced into an affair with the repulsive and boorish Stasi cultural minister Bruno Hemph (Thomas Thieme). On top of that the works of he and his friends will never be spared the wrath of state censorship, even though he is considered one of the more ""loyal"" artists in the community.<br/><br/>While Wiesler is chosen to monitor the ""arrogant"" writer and his girlfriend, he soon finds himself drawn deeper and deeper into their day to day life. Wiesler's Icy exterior begins to thaw as he ease-drops day and night typing voluminous notes. While it is a political thriller Von Donnersmarck, contracts and eases the tension perfectly offering pure moments of human connection and drama especially as the film progresses. He uses the original score at the most opportune times, and to maximum emotional effect. It contains many genuinely touching scenes, rich, deeply layered acting and an ending that's deeply poignant. In it's closing moments, The Lives of Others will make you proud to be a human being.<br/><br/>Paulie the Hat"

","A truly amazing and insightful movie, especially considering that the director, Henckel Von Donnersmarck, was only 16 in 1989 when the Wall came down.

He left behind his ailing father, who pushed him to leave, knowing that he would never see his son again, which proved true since the 63 year old man died in 1954. Also stayed his older sister and her family of husband and one year old twin girls. His sister and her family started visiting him in France (where he was living at the time) in the early sixties, and then in the eighties in Canada, where we had settled in 1979. Since he had left, his family kept on being persecuted, interrogated, spied on and professionally demoted. When I visited them for the first time in Czechoslovakia in 1987 after my husband died, my sister-in-law whispered in my ear that we had to be very careful of what we were saying, since the superintendent of the building was a police informant who had probably bugged their apartment.<br/><br/>The actors, most of them relatively too young to have known the full extent of the abuses of the regime, are all excellent, with the notable exception of the leading lady, who seemed notably emotionless and uninvolved, motivating my not giving a perfect 10 to this seminal movie."

","Do you believe in time travel? I didn't for a long time until I visited Berlin in 1989. I was in a youth delegation and at that time, the rapidly diminishing Berlin wall was making headlines everywhere thus, becoming a grossly unattractive tourist attraction.<br/><br/>I recall strolling through the affluent, bustling, modern west Berlin and suddenly, I found myself in a city street I only saw at archived pictures. The sidewalks were cracks laden, the houses-charred and the public parks seemed like the headquarters of weed-gone-wild. It was very much like the Berlin immediately after world war two. I know that I didn't have to go to Berlin to see a city which entails neglected areas as well as well maintained ones. Hell, I don't have to go outside the very city I live in (Jerusalem) to see that, but Berlin of 1989 wasn't a city of different economic classes, it was two adjacent cities each located in a different dimensions and one of these dimensions was stagnant. <br/><br/>The stagnant dimension east Berlin is the home of Georg Dreymen, a high renowned author/ playwright and also a strong believer of the socialist ideology. his wife, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck in a flawless performance) is one of the most prominent actresses in East Germany. Dreyman and Sieland are articulate, take pride in their country's ideology and also happen to be talented in their craft and boast many powerful friends. One might think they are the last people to pose a threat to the regime. That is unless one works in the Stazi, the secret police of East Germany. The Stazi, ""the shield and sword of the party"" as their motto exclaimed, were the embodiment of Orwell's vision of ""1984"". The ""Big brother"" in a thick, German accent. One of the Stazi's employees, a bureaucrat called Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe in a wonderful performance) takes charge of the couple's surveillance, waiting to see if the golden boy of the regime plots against it. <br/><br/>Surely enough, Wiesler, the well seasoned Stazi agent, finds out that his instincts were right and that Dreymen is willing to risk his stature in order to reveal the real story of the country that stifles any shred of independent thought and prosecutes its intellectuals to isolation, frustration and, in many cases, to ""self inflicted murders"" as the regime defines it.<br/><br/>Wiesler knows that this information can guarantee him a lifetime of privileges most East-Germans can only dream of but as he continues his surveillance, a peculiar transformation occurs, Wiesler can no longer see Dreyman and his wife as subjects, or targets to neutralize. he finds himself enchanted by the couple's mutual love and spirit and decides to give precedence to their silent struggle rather than to the interests of the organization he was once so proud of. What happens next is for you to find out and for me to be mesmerized by.<br/><br/>Today it seems way too easy to mock the Communist regimes but what many seem to forget is that Communism (and I am saying this as a capitalist) is probably the most well intentioned ruling system conceived by man. The society of no classes, where everyone gets to live a respectable life is a noble notion. No hidden sarcasm here, I truly mean that. Communism failed not because of the Stazi's ruthlessness or because of Stalin's atrocities (although none of those helped), it failed because of the human nature. Mankind always fought first and foremost, for egotistical purposes. It may not be flattering but it's true all the same. In East Germany, the monetary system was not the universal reward for one's abilities so influence, information and terror became the hard currency. You can consider the methodical diligence and thoroughness of the Stazi as evil but in reality, all Weisler did, at least at first, was just derived of human nature.<br/><br/>Humanity is the corner stone of the film and the director (I would have written his name but I have a thousand words limit...) propels the film with the humanity of the characters. The dialogs are not only credible but also vivid. The lively world of those who chose not to stifle their creativity is masterfully accentuated against the Grey buildings of East Germany and the portrayal of Wiesler, the former emotionally crippled agent. It's that contrast between the human spirit and the Government interests that brought the demise of East-Germany. I could go on and on about the masterful direction, the perfect script or the superb acting (Ulrich Muhe's performance of Wiesler is nothing short of captivating. His recent death is a gigantic loss to the Cinematic world, no doubt) but the truth is that this movie leaves such an impression for a different reason altogether. That reason is the perfect blend of talent, passion and diligent film making. Every scene is crucial for the plot or to accentuate the state of mind of the protagonists; Every shot masterfully designed to build up towards the inevitable climax. The two hours of this film are so engrossing that every single viewer transforms to the dreaded East-German citizen, frozen by his own thoughts and the possibility that someone might be aware of them.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.<br/><br/>P.S. This film is set to be ""Hollywoodized"". An English language remake is scheduled for 2010. I know some might have trouble with the German language but I also know this: The odds that the hypothetical (as of 2007) remake will achieve the impact of this film is slim to none. I would hate to see this film reduced to a pale, English speaking copy simply because some people can't get used to sub-titles."

","This movie paints the creepy picture of what it is like to live in a state where Big Brother is always watching (or at least listening). It lives off of a very well-written script, characters with a lot of depth and different facets. And it gets along without seeming key ingredients such as action scenes, which seem to make up most of the films we see today.<br/><br/>This movie is a textbook example (in the best sense) of how to build up story arcs, tension, and suspense. Despite its runtime (well over two hours) and its virtual non-existence of action, gore and special effects, the film is not boring for a second. While action and gore are absent, the film is not free of violence. The interrogation scene at the beginning where the prisoner is deprived of sleep until he breaks down displays this type of violence most visually. It appears more subtly throughout the movie whenever the Stasi invades Dreyman's privacy and listening to his conversations. However, it never takes any spectacular dimension.<br/><br/>""The Lives of the Others"" shows that films don't need spectacle to be spectacular, as long as the other ingredients that drive narration (script and acting, in particular) are as well-crafted as they are in this film."

","I saw this film last night at the Denver film festival. The small theater was standing room only-the director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck remained standing in the back throughout the entire film! He introduced the film at the beginning and then took questions afterward. One interesting comment he made was that this film is enjoying success outside of Germany similar to that of ""Run Lola Run,"" but where that film was most enjoyable, ""Lives of Others"" leaves people feeling very sad.""<br/><br/>Indeed, this is a ""heavy"" movie and at 137 minutes, it is not for the ""short attention span crowd! The attention to detail is incredible. The director explained how the prop master for the film was extremely careful with accuracy down to the finest detail of life at that time in East Germany. Viewers who stick it out are richly rewarded with a film that, according to Henckel von Donnersmarck, accurately depicts the sort of experience many artists of the time endured when their lives were invaded by ""Stasi"" (Secret Police)spies, hundreds of thousands of shadow characters who did not really live their own lives but in a perverse way, lived vicariously through those of their victims.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Some may remember Martina Gedeck from her role as ""Martha"" in ""Mostly Martha,"" a German release from a few years ago. She is beautiful in a subtle performance as Christa-Marie, an East German stage actress who performs the lead role in Dreyman's play about a factory worker who has visions. We see her perform near the beginning of the film and soon learn she and Dreyman are lovers. Sebastian Koch is believable as the talented and handsome writer Dreyman who seems to actually be in the favor of the Stasi. Ulrich Muhe at first appears as a Stasi interrogator, cold and unfeeling. He soon comes to learn perhaps more than he wants to know about the actress, the playwright and their circle of friends. <br/><br/>The director commented that although Muhe has garnered praise and awards for his characterization of the Stasi spy, he feels that Sebastian Koch also gives a great performance. Another interesting side note explained by von Donnersmarck is the fact that most of the former Stasi Spies have never been held to account for their crimes against the innocent people of the former East Germany. In fact, one of those people defended himself by saying that his volumes of detailed reports were all ""made up"" and now he makes a career as a sort of ""ambulance chasing"" lawyer helping these former spies sue anyone who accuses them of having spied on them! Huge sums of money are even now, being paid in reparations to these ""victims"" instead of to the actual victims of that totalitarian regime-incredible !"

","I saw this film yesterday, because I heared great things about it. After I've seen it, I don't really get what's so great about it. Sure, it's a good movie, but an 8.5 average is a bit exaggerated in my opinion.<br/><br/>To me, the plot wasn't very original and so predictable. The story of the strict stasi, who slowly turns over to the other side, because of the man he has to watch, to me is a bit corny. I could guess everything that was going to happen. Because of that, the movie didn't really have my full attention for one single moment. And even though the director gives the viewer a good insight in how it was back then, I feel like he could have brought it with a more original script.<br/><br/>Also other things don't really make the movie brilliant. Although the acting was outstanding, the music and most of all the camera-work weren't that great at all. I would call it average. But like i said the outstanding actors and the historic insight it gives, make up a lot. therefore i would rate it a 7.4 or something. 8.5 is way too much."

","A wonderful film which gives viewers just a taste of life under a Communist regime. It's a shame that Communism has not been examined and discredited as thoroughly as the equally evil Nazism. It's a little hard to comprehend the tyranny, from a place as free as the United States. The risks these people were taking, to accomplish such a minor thing, publishing an article that was fairly mildly critical of the government, should really strike home for those of us living in free countries. The only problem with the portrayal is that the two main characters, who seem at the start to be committed Communists, both turn away, showing their humanity, when in reality I think that this must have been fairly rare, from fear if not for logic or conscience. But even so the showing of an unapologetic taste of Communist tyranny is unusual, even to this day, and all the more powerful for that."

"howard.schumann","10","5","9","26 February 2007"," A powerful depiction of what it means to be human
","German filmmakers, in contrast to their frank portrayals of Nazi horrors, have mostly dealt with the misdeeds of the Communist system by poking fun at the bumbling apparatchiks of the GDR in comedies such as Good Bye Lenin. Interestingly, 56% of the German people believe it is inappropriate to even discuss the Communist's wrongdoing and a rehabilitation campaign is now being waged by former Secret Police (Stasi) operatives who claim that East Germany was not a criminal state but only one that ""served the people and obeyed the laws that were the laws of that time."" A different point of view is offered, however, in the brilliant The Lives of Others written and directed by 33-year old Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who grew up in West Berlin.<br/><br/>Winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film and countless Lolas at the National German Film Awards, the film is a haunting look at the paranoia of the East German security apparatus in the year 1984, a paranoia that ended only with the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in November, 1989 and the eventual reunification of East and West. The film shows the Stasi using intimidation and disorientation as tools in operating a ruthless system of control and surveillance directed at artists and intellectuals suspected of opposing the GDR. While fictional, the film displays the totalitarian mentality in a way that transcends particular circumstances and is relevant in our country today with its so-called Patriot Act that threatens liberty in the name of state security.<br/><br/>Set in East Berlin five years before glasnost, von Donnersmarck and photographer Hagen Bogdanski capture the grey atmosphere of an authoritarian state showing in muted sepia tones its drably furnished apartments, bare offices, and empty streets. As the film begins, Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, masterfully performed by Ulrich Muehe, uses videotape to educate recruits about Stasi interrogation methods. In the tape, a man is shown being reduced to tears after fifty hours of relentless questioning, finally breaking down and revealing the identity of his accomplice. Later, during an evening at the theater, Wielser expresses suspicion about the true loyalties of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend, the popular stage actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), even though both are known to be loyal to the Socialist state.<br/><br/>At the behest of colleagues, Lt. Colonel Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), head of the Cultural Department and Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), the Minister of Culture who has his own reasons for ordering the surveillance, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment wired from top to bottom. As Wiesler, identified only as HGW XX/7, sits in his dark office plugged into his headsets and tape recorder, he observes Dreyman and Christa going about their lives and it is not a comfortable experience for him. The gradual exposure of the expressionless bureaucrat to a different way of life that includes music, literature, and freedom of expression leads him to look at his life in a new way, a way that makes clear the arrogance of his superiors. It is the catalyst for a surprising plot that has numerous twists and turns and ends up as a powerful depiction of what it means to be human.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others succeeds not only by its broad strokes but by its attention to detail. An example is the revealing scene when Wiesler rides in an elevator with a naive young boy clutching his football. When the young boy tells him that his father hates the Stasi, Wiesler begins to ask him the name of his father, then stops in mid sentence, and inserts the word football for father. As Wiesler's loyalty becomes shaky and Dreyman mourns the suicide of an old friend, stage director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert), the story takes on an added dimension, slowly building momentum until it reaches a staggering conclusion that is so moving, yet so understated that tears didn't come until I reached home."
"cynthia94941","9","5","9","24 February 2007"," An unheralded gem
","This movie is getting very little press, but it is a remarkable and compelling film with outstanding performances and excellent direction. It takes place just before the end of the cold war, when the Berlin wall came down and East Germany was no longer isolated and terrorized by the Stasi--the secret police. The main character is a Stasi agent and a professor of a class for incoming agents. He teaches his students to be suspicious of everyone and outlines techniques for breaking down a suspect, such as months of sensory deprivation. He couldn't appear to be much more of a cold-hearted drone.<br/><br/>Politics of the most venal kind shape the plot, wherein the head of the Stasi wants to get rid of the boyfriend/playwright of an actress whom he (and nearly every character in the movie) finds captivating so that he can have her to himself. He orders that the couple's apartment be wired in hopes that the boyfriend will reveal himself as an enemy of the state. Our agent/professor takes 12-hour night shifts in the attic in front of a bank of recording devices and a front-door video feed, listening in on everything that goes on between the actress and the playwright.<br/><br/>Sound dreary? It isn't. The playwright and his friends are alive--real people. You see what goes on in the apartment, and in the rendezvous of the playwright and his friends, and his now-blacklisted director. You come to understand how much is at stake for an artist who loses state sanction. You see the love and respect that the playwright and the actress have for one another. You see the politicking behind this attempt to find some evidence of subversiveness that would knock the playwright out of commission. And you see glimmerings of humanity begin to develop in our drone-like agent/professor.<br/><br/>I'll say no more of the plot, other than that the tone of the movie is consistent and the acting is impeccable throughout. The plot advances at its own pace, and the director avoids the heavy-handed or sappy ending that most directors would have been tempted to employ.<br/><br/>This is without question one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I strongly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind subtitles or a leisurely pace."
"bkrauser-81-311064","10","4","7","14 January 2016"," A Quiet, Meticulous, Well-Made Thriller
","In the very first minutes of The Lives of Others, the unassuming Captain Gerd Wiesler (Muhe) sits in a small office interrogating a prisoner of the East German Stasi. He records his progress on tape and within hours Wiesler exhausts his prisoner to the point of confession, The tape stops; Wiesler is in a classroom teaching pupils at the university how to do the same. Within those first minutes we get a strong impression of his character; calculated, reserved and above all meticulous. It's those traits along with his dedication to Communism that make him a perfect surveillance man, at least according to Grubitz (Tukur) his supervisor.<br/><br/>After attending a show by the popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Koch), Wiesler and Grubitz take an interest in the internationally acclaimed artist. A nationalist, a pro-Communist and loyal to the government; he must be up to no good figures the curious Wiesler. With the coaxing of the Minister of Culture (Thieme), Wiesler sets up a surveillance operation in the attic of Dreyman's apartment complex and places bugs throughout his abode. It is only after weeks of listening does Wiesler realize the Minister has an interest in Dreyman's mistress Christa (Gedeck). Grubitz sees room for advancement if they manage to find dirt on the playwright but Wiesler becomes enveloped in the complex and intriguing lives of Dreyman and Christa. Wiesler even starts to participate quietly in the shadows, making decisions that could change the fate of all involved forever.<br/><br/>The essence of The Lives of Others script is essentially political. The workings of the Stasi serve its own self-survival by becoming a tool of Ministers and party elites. What matters more isn't the innocence or guilt of those who commit crimes against the State but whether those under suspicion have the political clout to protect themselves. Those who don't have two remedies, arrest or suicide. It is in-fact a suicide that initiates Dreyman's disillusionment with the entire system and kicks the torrent of dramatics into high gear. That and Christa's abusive relationship with the Minister.<br/><br/>Yet there's something much deeper and beautiful about the story than merely being a manifesto against big brother. The acting is so nuanced and superb that the characters become the focal point of audience emotional investment and story tension. Ulrich Muhe especially deserves praise as a foil to Sebastian Koch's Dreyman. Both become disillusioned but for opposite reasons. While Dreyman starts seeing the forest through the trees sort to speak, Wiesler starts seeing people as people instead of abstractions or obstacles of a Communist ideal.<br/><br/>There was much ado about The Lives of Others winning Best Foreign Language film at the Academy Awards over the heavy favorite Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Both are beautifully rendered political parables with tenacious emotional strength yet while one has a sense of exhaustive grandeur and filigree, the other is muted, meticulous, and pensive in its plotting. While some may balk at the thought of a reticent thriller, The Lives of Others uses its less ostentatious style to its advantage as evidenced by the dark green mis en scene of Stasi HQ, the faded warmth of Dreyman's apartment and the sooty grays of the attic where Wiesler quietly listens."

The film is about the Stasi (German secret police) and their investigation of a playwright. It is interesting because through the course of their investigation, the man in charge starts to relate to the folks he's listening to and eventually abandons his determination to work for the regime. In fact, over time he slowly begins to cover up much of the writer's anti-government activities and tries very hard to save the guy.<br/><br/>There is much more to the movie and it it hadn't been reviewed so many times already, I would give a much more detailed review.

The movie lays down a convincing foundation and constructs these human characters."

","You can sacrifice anything but yourself and your love and love filled with guilt is better to be dead.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie is complex to construe coz it has many layers, its very humane as a theme and brings very gross realities as a human being. Setup in the 1980's Germany where it was still divided and it was in East Germany about an artist couple, a writer and an actress being watched over by the Stasi, by HGW XX/7 the code name of the Policeman who wil note the records of what the couple does all through. This policeman played by Ulrich Muhe is the protagonist of the film. Now, the whole movie drives with his writings, his listenings and what he makes out of them. Truth is kept alive by this man and that is what he lives for, for truth. <br/><br/>Now, few movies have a very engrossing screenplay from first frame and this one has it and deservingly is one of the best films in terms of story and screenplay, the direction is so well done that never for a slightest moment did I feel that something was out of place or it is uncalled for, everything went as per the script which is the true hero. There are no aberrations as such as each character is etched out superbly. You cannot write characters as black and white coz there is a flaw in each and that's what is shown. <br/><br/>It's one of the few films that is supremely human and music too has it's own place to bring out humanity, like reference of Lenin's quote on Betthoven's symphony. Watch it to know it, I cannot comprehend in mere words what this film is. <br/><br/>One of the superb films in recent times. I make it 5/5."

","Set on the 1980s and during the Cold War, ""Das Leben der Anderen"" tells the story of the world created by the Stasi (the internal army created by the Socialist Party) and the citizens of the GDR living in a world of repression.<br/><br/>The official state police, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhn), is a specialist in interrogation and is assigned the espionage case of a playwright named Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch).<br/><br/>It is for this reason (being a playwright) that he is placed under surveillance. As the investigation progresses, he unknowingly becomes aware of its own existence and limited empathy for those who follow him, taking precedence over their obedience and loyalty to the Stasi - so much so that he begins to fudge documents and lying about the events in the life of Dreyman.<br/><br/>""Das Leben der Anderen"" is a low budget ever for a German film but it is exceptionally written capturing the essence of people's feelings at the time.<br/><br/>The cinematography is wonderful and captures a dark and drab East Germany,with its dull lighting and soft colors, perfectly illustrated the dismay of its citizens. The performances throughout the film are excellent, the best performance however for me is from Ulrich Muhn. the film is a great piece of art and entertainment that should be seen by any movie lover.

"classicsoncall","9","3","5","23 August 2014"," ""If you don't take a stand, you're not human.""
","Set in 1984 East Berlin, ""The Lives of Others"" focuses on a man, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), who undergoes a gradual transformation that ultimately ends in tragedy for the 'enemies of socialism' he originally sets out to investigate. That transformation occurs painstakingly over time and with no single event to make him change his mind. Instead, Weisler gains a gradual understanding of human beings who value artistic creativity and freedom along with an insight into what makes them tick. The story takes a remarkable turn when the investigator becomes part of the investigation, and is exiled to a proletarian job within the bureaucracy of the Stasi controlled government. Filmed less than a decade ago, the ironies consistent with present day surveillance techniques of the NSA, Google-mapping, and insidious tracking of every keystroke (including these) are a chilling prophecy of mind and thought control unimaginable even in ""1984""."
"rachit-mishra94","10","3","5","17 August 2014"," Who would say this was a directorial debut?
","Das Leben der Anderen ! <br/><br/>I have never watched German movies before. For that matter, i watched few foreign language films lately like I SAW THE DEVIL, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN and a few others. Call it my good taste of movies or just my good luck, i picked two German movies at random yesterday and decided to watch them without even reading the review and without even knowing that both of them had Ulrich Muhe as the lead actor. The movies were FUNNY GAMES and this epic masterpiece, THE LIVES OF THE OTHERS. My mind got blown after watching the FUNNY GAMES, and after watching THE LIVES OF THE OTHERS, it went back to where it was. <br/><br/>The lives of the others is truly a commendable masterpiece. If this is what's directorial debut for German directors, i would devote my whole free time to watching German movies from now on! Also, i want to take a bow after watching ULRICH MUHE's acting. To my surprise, his first movie i watched was FUNNY GAMES few hours back and i didn't knew that he was there in THE LIVES OF THE OTHERS too. Now i am totally spellbound by seeing him act. <br/><br/>His character of Weisler in the movie is a very complex one. It's simply complex. His eyes always give that look of a duty-bound STASI official who would do anything for his state. It's true that he becomes increasingly consumed and obsessed by the lives of Dreyman and christa while keeping a tab on them(surveillance) but not even a pinch of that is hinted until later near the end when he shockingly reaches Dreyman's house before Grubitz and hides the typewriter. Felt really bad because Christa died for no reason... but now that's what was destined to happen, right? I mean i could sense that for once.. This movie depicts about the system prevailing in the GDR in the best possible fashion...about the politics, the systems of confidentiality, the procedural systems, clandestine stuffs...... A serious reconsideration is needed by people who think that movies on the subject of SPYING need have action and more action in it. This movie not just debars that misconception but also replaces the same by an innovation and a story even more touchy, emotional, suspenseful all of which makes it a marvel. <br/><br/>Hats off to the direction and hats off to Ulrich Muhe. May his soul rest in peace. <br/><br/>P.S : Best foreign language movie ever watched."

","A stasi career policeman gets a conscience after listening in on a couple of artists for a day or two. Uh, no...don't think so. To get to the level he was at you'd have to be pretty fanatical about the ideology you're employed to protect.

","I remember when the NSA/ Edward Snowden scandal broke there were a few differing opinions on the topic; either you were outraged (though not entirely surprised) that the government had been keeping tabs on you (as I was), or, you shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. ""I've got nothing to hide,"" was one of the most common things I heard stated. ""If the government wants to spy on me they'll probably be pretty bored."" To me, that kind of nonchalance about this very serious issue is just as terrifying as finding out that the government is spying on us.<br/><br/>Sure, you might not have anything to hide now, but what happens when suddenly your friendly neighbor, whom occasionally talked brashly about the government, just disappears and no one goes looking for him? What happens when your wife or daughter starts getting approached by public officials and blackmailed for sex? What happens when innocent protesters end up detained in windowless prison cells for months? These are not situations I've made up to scare you; these are things that have happened and will happen again. If we don't keep those in power in check, it will happen in our own country.<br/><br/>To the people that approach the idea of surveillance states with lackadaisical ambivalence, I think they need to see movies like ""The Lives of Others"" or ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days""; they need to read books like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. This issue is not one we should approach with a shrug; it's an issue we need to fight, tooth and nail, with every scrap of energy we can muster.<br/><br/>Anyways, that is why I personally love this movie and think it's a masterpiece (my second viewing has cemented its place in my top 100 films of all time), but from a cinematic standpoint, this movie is absolutely incredible as well.

We were never told about this in the former Yugoslavia. Since we had a free travel possibility to the West, GDR considered Yugoslavia a capitalist state?!? Only after the Wall fell we understood the real horrors which East Germans who did not follow the Party line had to endure. At the same time it was very interesting how those who followed the Party line enjoyed good, almost an excellent life.<br/><br/>At the same time it shows how the ones who were high, fall so low as the system changes.

","About half-an-hour into the movie I thought I was in for a bit of a rough ride, you know... that force-yourself-to-the-end type of film. Fortunately, the movie got better and more intriguing as it progressed, turning out to be a very rewarding piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Luckily, I managed to bypass my initial negative preconceptions, such as the German language, having subtitles and no recognisable actors, deciding to give the film a go based on my very positive experiences of foreign language films this year, in the place of the usual insult to your intelligence, spoon-fed Hollywood fodder.<br/><br/>It's a rewarding film that requires a certain amount of perseverance at the start. It's educational, thought provoking, visually intriguing but not beautiful, almost beleaguering your senses with the grimy weather, the drab clothes worn by practically all, the use of greys and browns for furnishings, the austere colour palette, the depressing standard of the cars and vans, and virtually nothing joyous or warm to look at. We're instead reliant on our involvement with the characters and their insights and motives for doing what they do.<br/><br/>A film that seems to adapt and improvise as it goes along, the characters feeling their way through events as well, entering uncharted waters and discovering the need to swim. Yet again, film that establishes the value of historical diversity that Germany has to offer from the 20th century. Only, the language/subtitle thing may put a few people off from the start, which is a shame if you're young and looking for action-satisfaction."
"KiltedGreen","10","2","3","26 April 2007"," A masterpiece in monochrome
","A superb and gripping film which begins in a scarily detached, unemotional way and finished with tears running down my face at the final frame. This film is a journey from alienation to connection and much of its power comes from exposing us to the vicious banality of the Stasi's operations.<br/><br/>The environment in which the film is set is minimal, dirty and monochromatic, but the performances are anything but, believably conveying the suspicion and insidiousness of the ruling regime and the constraints of the human soul. We are shown the limits of freedom and what happens to those who want to express it but we are presented with a moving and powerful portrayal of awakening human spirit despite the powers that would crush them into conformity.<br/><br/>Others have expressed the details more elegantly than I, but I have to say that when I thought it ended superbly, it continued to build its message until the wonderful, touching and incredibly moving final seconds. I sobbed into the credits, but it's not for that mawkish heart-string pulling stuff, this is a perfect ending with a deep emotional resonance that perfectly rounds off a wonderful film."

","This film has just opened in London and I attended one of the first screenings. I wish I could add something to the whole host of superlatives made by previous posters. This is a truly awesome film, at the very least a mini masterpiece and possibly even a fully-fledged one. With the best will in the world people in the West can never really KNOW what it was like to live in a state of constant long-distance supervision but this film - made by a native of West Germany who, by definition, has never known it either - comes as close as any to making us privy to that sensation. All the credits are impeccable from Writing, Directing down to the smallest 'extra' and it is wonderful to see Martina Gedeck, so great as Bella Martha, and Sebastian Koch, equally good in Black Book, once more but excellent as both are they are outshone by Ulrich Muhe as the Stasi official charged with monitoring their lives. Weighing in at a little over two hours and with no sex or violence to speak of the film nevertheless rivets the attention by - if not in spite of - the very grayness which informs it with Muhe, himself a victim of Stasi surveillance, outstanding as he mutates from automaton to human being but totally from WITHIN (no dramatic histrionics here to symbolize his volte-face, just acting of the most subtle kind). A film incapable of being overpraised and one that should be seen by every discerning film-goer."
"Cary_Barney","10","2","3","31 March 2007"," Long live tragedy!
","When everybody calls a movie ""the movie of the year"", ""an instant classic"", etc., you suspect hype. This time it's not hype. It's heartening to see people respond so strongly to a film that's simply deep and true and doesn't sugar-coat its message. I think audiences are responding to something we don't get enough of at the movies: tragedy.<br/><br/>The debased word ""tragedy"" gets attached these days to anything sad -- in newspaper headlines about teenagers killed in drunk driving accidents, for example. As a result it's easy to forget that tragedy is really a way of seeing, of apprehending the deepest, most painful truths about ourselves, especially when this self-knowledge comes too late to save us. Oedipus, King Lear, Hedda Gabler...through suffering they see the truth about their lives, and take us on a journey that makes us question ours.<br/><br/>Every once in a while a character in a movie takes us on that journey and reaches this kind of tragic self-awareness. Bogart at the end of ""High Sierra"". Kevin Spacey's character at the end of ""American Beauty"". More than one character in ""The Lives of Others"" attains this sort of tragic vision, and the amazing thing about this superb film is how quietly it happens -- since all of the characters are under surveillance, can't talk to each other except in code, can't show any outward signs. This is a triumph of narrative and of acting.<br/><br/>It's about the East German experience and you probably couldn't find a better way to understand that experience (if you don't know anyone who was there) than seeing this film. (""Goodbye Lenin"" got the cultural trappings but couldn't make up its mind whether to be a satirical farce or a sentimental drama and subsequently failed as both.) But the totalitarian setting really serves to throw into sharp relief the film's deeper concerns, about the consequences of our betrayals (of ourselves and of others); and about how human empathy and decency can find a way to operate in our lives, no matter what system we have to operate within.<br/><br/>There's no CGI, no jumbled chronology, no easy dichotomy of good and bad. Just an intricate, absorbing and absolutely true story (in the sense that ""fiction is a lie that tells the truth""). Just excellent acting and directing, not a word or movement wasted. And hard-won, quiet redemption that because of the system's restraints comes too late to avert tragedy. The way redemption happens in real life, not in bathetic spectacles like ""Crash"". Deep down, audiences are responding to truth, which is something we're all starved for."

","It's weird that first films from a first director get my full support, but The Lives of Others is really something special, both beautifully portrayed and written. It's also clear, of course, that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has skill; even though it's only his first film, some of the content of the film is so remarkable that it immediately brings up previous works from veteran directors.<br/><br/>Critics have already been diminishing the film, claiming that it is flat as a character study. The truth is, they're right (If Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck would have concentrated more on character study, critics would have been hailing it as a masterpiece). But if one opts to take out the character study abroad, a clear and remarkable thriller will remain. The Lives of Others is truly something special and rare, disturbingly accurate and really quite extraordinary. The film is likely to win the Academy Award for best foreign film, and in a way it deserves it, also like Pan's Labyrinth. In the end, The Lives of Others proves to the viewer not only keen film-making skill, but rather the ability of mankind to change upon its surroundings. It's rare that a beginning film reach out to me the way this one did, but The Lives of Others is a most exciting film."
"flasch","10","2","3","9 March 2007"," One of the best movies ever about a totalitarian state
","Usually when watching a movie, I can find one or more things that I don't like. In this case I must admit that I didn't find a single detail that I disliked. Everything just worked, from the psychological play between the characters, to the very well written plot, and the way the political issues were handled.<br/><br/>Most movies about totalitarian states have one or more heroes fighting against the system, in most cases losing in the end, but occasionally winning. The main characters of this movie are much more complex than that. Ulrich Mühe, who plays a Stasi agent, does a very good job at showing how a character, who might be a one-dimensional villain in other movies, thinks and feels. But the whole cast is excellent. And there are so many fine little details, like the use of the word publikum (audience) and the red ink-spot."
"baepj-1","9","2","3","4 March 2007"," A ""Casablanca"" for Our Times
","""The Lives of Others"" reminded me of no film so much as ""Casablanca."" But there are differences: we are pretty sure of Rick's essential decency early on, in spite of his tough talk and cynicism, which he wears lightly. Even the love of his life will not send him into the camp of those who put little value on either love or life.<br/><br/>We are not so sure about Wiesler, the Stasi interrogator who is ordered to spy on an otherwise ""politically reliable"" playwright and his mistress in the East Germany of the 1980's. Wiesler, who has the face of a monk, is a true believer of the state he serves and its mission to ferret out dissidents and malcontents--particularly those who would flee to the west or embarrass the GDR in some way.<br/><br/>What we see is the gradual unfolding of a rigid man's moral sense, previously in thrall to a totalitarian ideology which he has convinced himself is ""humanistic,"" as he phrases it in his introductory scene. His surveillance of the couple quickly uncovers the role Culture Minister Hempf--a pig-faced villain who would be comic were he not also a rapist-- plays in it. From that point on his allegiance begins to shift, as his ""masters"" prove themselves unworthy of his devotion to his work. We see the first sign of this in the scene with the child on the elevator.<br/><br/>This is a movie about redemption, like ""16 Blocks."" It is a story that has been told many times but somehow never gets stale. Likewise it is one always worth retelling."

So far, so good.<br/><br/>The movie is at least 2 hours and 17 minutes long. But it doesn't take nowhere near enough time to focus on his most necessary point, the psychology transfer of the agent! Instead of it concentrates in his solid, but not very groundbreaking, background story about wiretapping, trust, betrayal, the Stasi and the inhuman system.<br/><br/>And do you know why? Because it was too difficult for the director! He runaround it. His own issue. He just uses some cheap tricks. He shows us, how the Stasi agent steals a book, written by the famous Heinrich Böll, whose works were forbidden in the DDR, from the author. And after that there is one shot where he reads a poetic part from it. While he's wiretapping him, he listens how beautiful his subject can play piano. Pling, Pling and suddenly he has become a different, better person who helps him. That's it. And that's too easy and too fast. And finally rather cheap.<br/><br/>The viewer doesn't get involved in a man's internal duel. We don't really understand, why he turns off from his principals. Of course we understand ourselves, that we (or most of us) don't want to live in a communistic system, but we can't empathize with this man about his change.<br/><br/>Mr. Von Donnersmarck doesn't make us feel he says us to feel.<br/><br/>But without making the experience of feeling, which could be told with the help of tools of a sensitive direction, this is not big cinema.<br/><br/>In his most important point this movie is weak, skin deep and unconvincing!!<br/><br/>That's my true opinion about it.<br/><br/>P.S.: I think one of the main reasons for the huge success of the film is, that there's been no film before, which concerned with the explosive Stasi theme.

The orders come from the highest echelons of the government, but Wiesler slowly begins to understand that the motives for them may not be as patriotic as they should. And at the same time the life of these two content souls begins to lure him in.<br/><br/>Despite this film being just over a decade old, it feels much older. And in this case that works in the film's favour, giving it an authentic feel, like it could have happened right there and then. it gives the film weight, which is good, because Stasi and their human right violations are some of the darkest aspects of East German history. And yet, at the same time the film tries to shy away from black and white moralizing. Wiesler's character, despite being a high-ranking Stasi officer, is not a monster, does posses a soul and certainly has his sympathetic moments. This has apparently caused certain amount of controversy, some believing that Stasi and its legacy should be shown no mercy, no sympathy. Which seems uncomfortably harsh to me.<br/><br/>Then again, I was only a few months old when the Berlin Wall came down. For me, this is history, something that happened in the distant past. It's funny for me to think that the events of this film took place when my parents were teenagers or young adults. The world has certainly changed since then.<br/><br/>For me this film is more interesting than it is good.

","I don't know German but this film really is incredible in terms of cinema. It's one of the films that deserved the Academy Award for foreign language. The cast does an incredible especially the male roles including the Captain who eavesdrops on the German playwright. He is torn between his country and doing the right thing. The film is surprising. Martina Gedeck is the best German actress alive in my opinion. She plays Christa with conviction and believability. Her character is the actress and playwright's lover. There is lot going on here since life under Communism was strictly under surveillance. Anything could get you locked up and imprisoned even the most innocent offenses. It's no wonder life under Communism was paranoid and frightening situation. It was all about control and lack of decision making. For anybody like myself whose parents were raised in Communist Poland, East Germany appeared to have everything under it's control much like George Orwell's novel, 1984. You don't want to be caught or even suspect under East German rule during this time. The film's almost perfect except I would like have seen a more solid ending."

","In 1984 East Berlin, an agent of the Stasi conducts surveillance on Georg Dreyman, a successful drama playwright and his longtime companion Christa-Maria Sieland, herself a popular actress. Both were huge intellectual stars in the former East Germany, although they secretly don't always toe the party line. One day, the Minister of Culture becomes interested in Christa. This is when Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is instructed to observe and sound out the couple but finds himself becoming increasingly absorbed by their lives.<br/><br/>I've only seen this movie once compared to the countless times I've seen Labyrinth and Working Girl. Yet I find myself thinking on this film more than the other two.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't understand German, in spite of living there in my youth, so I had to read the subtitles. I understand why many people don't like them, sometimes the dialogue is so long winded you don't even get to look up before the picture that goes with the words has moved on and you're back to reading again. This movie wasn't like that. The main character Wiesler, or the Watcher as I call him, spoke so infrequently that much of the time could be spent watching him. I believe it was the secret to my bonding so strongly to his character. I got to watch the Watcher, feel his emptiness, to the point he fell in love with the woman he watched, much like I fell in love with him as I watched.<br/><br/>Part of our job as writers, whether screenplays, books or teleplays, is to create a bond between our audience and our characters. Many try to do this by figuring out their viewer- or reader-ship and writing to that kind of person. For example you write a book about a teenager and your audience is a teenager. Many times you create a bond by putting the character in like circumstances to real life. In the Lives of Others the likelihood of a movie watcher being a member of the Stasi isn't very likely. So we as an audience had to be won over another way.<br/><br/>By plumbing these alternate connection techniques we as the writer can develop bonds our audience will follow anywhere. Ulrich Mühe played the Watcher, Gerd Wiesler, so well I couldn't separate the actor from the character in my mind. Since he didn't speak much it wasn't so much what he said but what he emoted.<br/><br/>This isn't the only well-executed element in the film though. In fact there are two more: the playwright, Georg Dreyman, and the actress, Christa-Maria Sieland. I really fell in love with the Playwright as well. Not at first, like the Watcher, but gradually over the course of the story like Wiesler did. The actor really represented here a flawed man and his skill lay in me loving the character in spite of those flaws. He was kind of a coward, understandably, but with a desire to be bold, to rebel. At the end when you realized he already was with another woman, you weren't surprised, and in fact if he hadn't been your belief in him would have been shaken. The more you got to know the Playwright the more flawed he became and the more you liked the man.<br/><br/>Cornerstone to the Playwright was the true love he felt for the actress, Christa. While watching the Actress, the Watcher came to love the Playwright because of the love they shared. Because she loved the Playwright. It's this relationship that made the Watcher's trip possible and allowed the audience to share his journey. I didn't bond with the Actress, in fact, just the opposite. I understood her position between a rock and a hard place, she had an addiction and a career she wanted to maintain. Like the men, I too found her beautiful and chase worthy. But it's actually my lack of connection to her that I found rather poignant. I'd much rather she die than either of the men and yet both would have preferred to take her place, even if the other man would have gotten her. There's something human and real and true about that kind of dichotomy. It makes the Actress as a character love worthy.<br/><br/>One critic I read mentioned perhaps there were too many epilogues, another mentioned the big white shorts of the villain. Part of the actress'es effect on these men were how they proceeded in the future. We needed to see the satisfaction of the Watcher in the choices he made, to know those years of steaming envelopes was worth it. We needed to see the Playwright's boldness bloom and prosper in it's own way. In this we can see the actress'es true and lasting impressions. The big white shorts don't play into it at all.<br/><br/>I'm haunted by this movie. It's not the dialouge or the plot, though these worked together in perfect harmony to make the film the knock out it is. As the years pass, we as human beings seek relationships like these three shared, ones that aren't transient by nature but if they end it's a tragedy. No matter in what media we find it, these are the kinds of experiences we seek to read or watch orwrite.<br/><br/>To read more of my reviews: http://yaykisspurr.wordpress.com/"

","East Germany. Secret Police. Spies. Surveillance. Not the things you would normally associate with love, requited or otherwise. Yet The Lives of Others features all of these things, and more, and does so softly, harshly, suggestively, and profoundly. It is a brilliant film that certainly deserved the Academy Award it won in 2007 for best Foreign Film. <br/><br/>Ulrich Muhe plays a humorless, loveless East German secret police operative, Hauptman Wiesler, directed to spy on a noted playwright, Georg Dreyman, played by Sebastian Koch. Dreyman seems to be unwavering in his loyalty to his country and its socialist system of government. Dreyman lives with his talented and revered actress girlfriend, Christa- Maria Sieland, brilliantly inhabited by Martina Gedeck. Ms. Sieland stars in Dreyman's most recent play. The drama is well received by all, including the members of the government hierarchy and bureaucracy. Nevertheless it is decided by the highest levels of the secret police, known as the Stasi, that it would be best if Wiesler overheard everything that is said, done, and most importantly, thought, inside Dreyman's home.<br/><br/>Because he has no personal life whatsoever, Wiesler is adept on spying on those that do. Because of his work lovers can't love, purists can be pure, and thoughts are never private. Wiesler exists so that his superiors can exist, indeed prevail. And, as a result, freedoms are lost and lives simply vanish.<br/><br/>Muhe's silent, subtle, evocative performance clarifies Wiesler's personal torment and conflict. It is an indelible performance that depicts the disciplined restraint required of a non-life dedicated to infringement and intrusion. But for me, it is Gedeck's haunting performance that crystallizes this film. Her demons are those of her country's; her conflicts are the conflicts of the society in which she lives She is vulnerable in the way a soul searches for its essence in a world that does not seem to have one. <br/><br/>All of the performances in this film are strong and convincing. Even minor characters have a significant in the film. There is the young boy who asks Muhe if he really is the bad man that the boy's father says he is. There is the lowly lieutenant whose untimely joke at the expense of the government momentarily causes him to believe that his career is suddenly over. If Koch's performance as Dreyman is the least memorable, it is because his role serves to provide the experiential expanse for the film's other characters to impress their elements. Every character is carefully crafted and expertly delivered.<br/><br/>Wiesler ultimately challenges the very authority he embodied, acts upon a love he never had, and gravitates towards freedoms he never possessed. Tragically, Sieland's personal legacy is the exact opposite; she surrenders to an authority she never accepted, flees a love she embraced, and casts aside the freedoms she craved.<br/><br/>I will indeed contemplate this outstanding film often. And when I do, I hope my inner most private thoughts stay private."
"Eumenides_0","8","1","1","13 January 2012"," Captivating Movie About Power, Altruism and Freedom
","""No matter how often you say it in your plays, people do not change!"" an East Germany minister declares to playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) in the movie. This is an ironic statement considering that East Germany in 1984 was part of Soviet Union at the time, and communism is predicated on the belief that human nature is malleable and that people can be improved, even if one has to break a few eggs in the process. It also encapsulates the protagonist's arc: the moral rebirth of Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), a high officer in the secret police, the feared Stasi. Wiesler, entrusted by his social-climbing superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), to spy on Dreyman and his actress girlfriend, Christa (Martina Gedeck) in the hope of finding something that will destroy him so a minister can have Christa for himself.<br/><br/>This is the plot, at turns far-fetched and sentimental, but mostly chilling and heart-wrenching, that filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck found to depict the actions of the secret police in East Germany. It's a plot that has its strengths and weaknesses, the most evident being the unclear motivation of the methodical, emotionally detached Wiesler to risk his career in helping a trouble-making playwright. Wiesler is a cipher without a back-story; his political convictions, or lack of them, aren't properly addressed in the film: we can't tell whether he's a staunch supporter or just an everyman doing his job by conformity. The movie portrays him as a lonely, efficient, paranoid workaholic. So his about-face raises questions of motivation.<br/><br/>This, incidentally, is a difficulty I often find in movies about protagonists who rebel against criminal organizations they previously worked for. An example from recent years can be found in Syriana. You'll remember George Clooney plays a CIA agent who, after a lifetime serving the agency, discovers it's doing bad things. The intelligent viewer will, of course, pause to wonder what rock he lived under when he wasn't in a mission, to consider that the CIA was a benign agency, when there's ample literature documenting its countless crimes, such as drugging its own agents with LSD to study the after-effects, paying a Canadian psychiatrist to perform illegal shock therapy on unwilling patients, and occasionally backing military coups in democracies. In the 21st century a CIA agent can't be that innocent. But Syriana needed a rogue CIA agent. And The Lives of Others needed a Stasi agent to learn to become human again, and that's a development that is always hard to portray convincingly. For how does a person learn to become good? We'll just invoke the acte gratuite here. Writer André Gide came up with this term, which translates roughly into gratuitous act, to name unmotivated actions needed to start the plot. The movie, of course, takes a shot at explaining Wiesler's metamorphosis, and that's another one of its weaknesses. Henckel, being a filmmaker, an artist, evidently believes art can improve people. The movie chalks up Wiesler's transformation to the art he comes into contact while surveilling the playwright's apartment. This reaches its climax when he cries listening to Beethoven's 'Appassionata'. ""Can anyone who has heard this music,"" the playwright asks Christa while he plays it in the piano, Wiesler listening to them, ""I mean truly heard it, really be a bad person?"" History proves, yes, they can, Mr. Idealistic-Writer-Bordering-On-Parody. But this movie will prove that people who like Beethoven are all self-sacrificing and intrinsically good. They just need a string of well-articulated tunes to remember them of their humanity. We'll forgive Henckel for this since it's an artist's prerogative to be naive.<br/><br/>The good far outweighs the bad in this movie, though. Its acting and writing are superb. The screenplay humanizes the Stasi agents in a way that is probably too unpleasant for some viewers, which makes it as courageous as another German movie, The Downfall, which boldly portrayed Adolf Hitler as a three-dimensional character several years ago. Although it's easier to hate monsters, the characters in this movie are all too familiar in their pettiness, ambitions, fear and subservience. Power is the most overt theme in the movie, after freedom of expression, and the movie does a good job of showing the hierarchy of power in East Germany, from the untouchable ministers down to the Stasi officers, the agents on the field, and finally the citizens at the bottom of the pyramid, spied on, interrogated, blackmailed and tortured arbitrarily.<br/><br/>The dialogue is excellent too, focused on the story while developing the characters, and full of double-entendres: dialogue, like the characters, has two faces, a private and a public one, the word's meaning changing according to circumstances, which makes this movie perfect for repeated viewings. The actors must have realized how good their roles were because they brought their best talent to it. Although the acting is generally good, Ulrich Mühe is head and shoulder above his co-stars. He delivers a fantastic performance as an emotionally reserved secret agent who lays his soul bare without the usual overwrought shenanigans that characterize Oscar-baiting performances. His minimalist acting, which mirrors the effect of his work on his existence, triumphantly results in one of the best performances of the last decade.<br/><br/>Although the acting and writing are top notch, Henckel could have done better with the directing. The camera work won't impress anyone. In this regard, the movie looks a lot like a play.<br/><br/>Still, the acting and the writing are so powerful, and they complement each other so harmoniously, they survive the director's lack of talent. The messages of individual freedom, the arbitrariness of power and personal responsibility somehow escape from the camera's dull stare. Whether as a fictional portrayal of an era and place rarely seen in cinema, as a morality tale, or as a work of art, The Lives of Others is an achievement of the highest order in modern cinema."

","The lives of Others. A striking drama concerning an agent (Ulrich Mühe) of the Eastern Germany Stasi and the man he is spying, a famous writer (Sebastian Koch). The plot is top quality, very well written and captivating. The Stasi suspects of Dreyman (the writer)'s political position, and as the influent person he is, his house is immediately wired and all his steps and breaths are controlled. The agent in charge of the operation, agent Wiesler, is this very tough, cold and incredibly loyal to the government, who slowly starts gaining sympathy towards the Dreyman and his wife, an actress who was keeping a sexual relationship with the minister, afraid to lose her job and reputation, and note that this minister was the one who had ordered the whole operation concerning Dreyman. Wiesler slowly falls back and suddenly, when a friends ""commits suicide"", Dreyman starts planning to write an article about the strange suiciding rate taking place in Eastern Germany, to be sent to the western press. Wiesler covers the whole thing, pretending they were preparing a piece, until the article arrives to West Germany as a bomb and invades the media. In fact, one o the best German movies I've seen, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (both director and writer) actually surprised me, questioning how was it possible to succeed this with The Tourist (2010). One time job? I hope not, but this proves that cast doesn't always have to mean something, it might just well be another crappy American movie. 8/10"
"jody-ann","10","1","1","20 November 2011"," Must see film, Oscar well-deserved.
","The Lives of Others stands out as a strong, moving, well-intentioned film. It has a lot to say about government corruption, about the perils of absolute power and about the complete carelessness of human life under repressive political systems. The main hero is a man named Gerd Weisler, a member of East Germany's notorious Stasi (secret police), and master interrogator who determines the specificity and overall direction of the film. Weisler doesn't start the movie out as a hero, however. In the first few scenes, he is portrayed as a typical Stasi, brutally evil and shamelessly sadistic. At the behest of the party boss, whose motives are shady and diabolical, he teams up with a fellow Stasi to spy on a prominent artist, Georg Dreyman, and his girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland. His purpose is to glean information intended to disprove Dreyman's loyalty to the DDR, East Germany's socialist republic. However, during the course of this surreptitious surveillance, we see Weisler reach a moral turning point as he comes to realize the cruel and corrupt nature of the Stasi cult, and begins to empathize not only with Dreyman and his girlfriend, but with all who suffer at the hands of a government with absolute power that is spiraling out of control. Weisler develops a conscience. Once a complex man driven by a mix of hatred and selfishness, he becomes simplified towards the end: a compassionate man who has learned the price of human life. The film, overall, maintains a sense of realism by not being overly sentimental nor overly exaggerated. The ending is quite moving yet leaves you wondering, to whom is this dedicated? Perhaps it's for the Weislers of that time who were able to show defiance in face of a powerful unrelenting system, or to men like Dreyman who made great leaps and put their lives on the line to fight for the overhaul of an unjust regime. Either way, the Lives of Others is a monument to the triumph of the human spirit. It is a must see film, Oscar well-deserved."
"thulean33","9","1","1","14 October 2011"," Brilliantly and precisely casted
","The casting for this movie is so near perfect that you wish other movies could get it as right as this movie does. Many movies have very intelligent writing and ideas, but the casting is wrong and it ends up reducing the intellectual value and authenticity of the movie.<br/><br/>All the major characters in this movie are casted with perfect actors that precisely capture the psychological depth behind the characters and the ideas in the writing. I had only one minor complaint in the casting of the prostitute whose body type was perfect for the part, but was a little too worn out and rugged looking. A younger, milkier, but slightly worn looking full figured woman would have lent the scene greater beauty and power and by contrast would have more realistically conveyed Hauptmann's need and loneliness.<br/><br/>The script is ideologically flawless, the ideas are intelligent and intuitive, it's incredibly sexy, and it is a very intelligently made movie. I don't see movies this precise, accurate, wise, and pointed very often. Recommended highly."
"Manal1987","8","1","1","13 July 2011"," Compelling.
","A compelling story with some outstanding acting. It relates the atrocities and transgressions exercised by the Secret Police in Eastern Germany back in the 1980s. The thing about this movie is that it might seem dull, lacking the basic thriller elements. However, watching it will have all your senses alerted, story and plot wise. The Lives of Others has all the ingredients of a historical and political movie, a gripping thriller and a heart-piercing drama, cleverly combined all together. Ulrich Muhe was absolutely amazing as the Secret Police agent Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler. His seemingly poker-face and lifeless expressions spoke words and showed emotions a thousand scripts couldn't have possibly expressed. Martina Gedeck stood out as well."

","The beginning was captivating by telling the theory of interrogation. A student in the East Germany era suggested that the questioning method might be inhumane, Agent Wieseler (also the teacher) immediately made a special mark next to his name.<br/><br/>Later in the move, the house search by the secret service, the rape of Christa-Maria Sieland by the supposedly righteous minister, the joke in the canteen about Erich Honecker (East German's head of state) etc, all caused a surge of adrenaline among the audience.<br/><br/>The wiretapping looked primitive, no flashy screens, no shrieking sounds from the radio signals, no special effects (not even gunshots), but the tension accumulated gradually by the authoritarian regime created a thriller-like play.<br/><br/>The ending was not bad also, indeed the best happiest ending possible in this story. Agent Wiesler's sacrifice was revealed to Georg Dreyman. Instead of thanking Wiesler for hiding his little secrets, Dreyman thanked ""HGW XX/7"" in his new book named Sonata for the Good Men.<br/><br/>While some critics said the movie was over-optimistic in human faith or naive in terms of the historical background, but please be reminded that it was a movie with a story based on history, not history itself."
"gradyharp","10","1","1","2 March 2007"," The Survival of the Individual Under the Cloud of Totalitarianism
","Das Leben der Anderen (The Live of Others) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall. It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.<br/><br/>It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend, brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken. Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christ-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists. It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Secret Police plans to destroy the artists' venture. The manner in which Weisler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances. The results of Weisler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this film - cinematography, pacing, lighting, editing, and the splendid musical scored my Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors. The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality, as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue, is astonishingly fine. This is a fascinating story, told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"

"JesseOcean","9","1","1","30 January 2007"," A precisely crafted story about the imprecise nature of circa-80's East Berlin conformity.
","First-time writer director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck offers a phenomenal debut achievement. From the opening scene, Lives creates a paranoid, frightening universe that methodically contorts the characters' natures until a satisfying conclusion. <br/><br/>We are first introduced to Captain Gerd Wiesler. In a brilliantly played stoic, naturalistic and nuanced performance by Ulriche Muhe, Wiesler is the best of the worst: an expert in spying, interrogation, and sniffing out anti-socialist sentiment. While instructing a class of will-soon-be East Berlin secret police (Stasi), a student raises his hand and questions one of Wiesler's techniques for being inhumane. Wiesler coolly marks an X next to the students name on the roll sheet. <br/><br/>At the conclusion of class, we meet Lieutenant Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), an old school friend of Wiesler's who, due to inauthenticity and an ability to schmoose, has risen to a high ranking job in the government. They attend a theater where a play by Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), the best play-write in the East read ""in the West"", is debuting with Dreyman's lover Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). <br/><br/>Secretly accused of being too devoted to Socialist Ideals, Wiesler is given the task of digging up dirt on Dreyer. Within 20 minutes the artist's entire apartment is bugged, placing Wiesler in a perch in the attic. As the Stasi listens he discovers not only Dreyer's sincerity of belief but also the true motivation for the order to observe him. An entertainingly nasty government higher-up, Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), is forcing Sieland into an affair and wants to eliminate his only competition in Dreyer. <br/><br/>A gradual, genuine paradox is spurned in Wiesler as he grows to care greatly for the complete strangers below. On a surface level this seems like an incredible leap. As if Wiesler is just now beginning to understand the effects of a society built on the surveillance and back-stabbing of neighbors, friends, and family. The performances and the writing do pull this off, including a memorable quote from Grubitz, who has exploited and manipulated everyone he could without a true concern for socialistic ideals, ""In life it's not grades, it's results. The structure of the story is tight as cord and it is here where you really feel its grip. <br/><br/>When a friend of Dreyer commits suicide, due to an artistic death caused by an indefinite blacklisting for obscure political reasons, Dreyer sets to put his words against the government that he has become disillusioned with. Procuring a difficult to trace typewriter that he hides under the floorboards, Dreyer begins meeting with two subversives who listen to his anti-government essay, read aloud, to give him feedback. <br/><br/>This would be, of course, the perfect opportunity for Wiesler to prove himself and his efforts to his Grubitz, whose next promotion is wedged on pleasing Hempf. Instead, he begins actively covering for Dreyer. This remarkable turn from a cold, menacing Stasi does not play as either a inconsistent or sympathetic to the system of informants and secret police of the past East Berlin. All of the emotional and logical threads of Lives are woven so tightly as to make each transgression by Dreyer and, consequently, by Wiesler seem compelling and natural.<br/><br/>Even when Wiesler's 'conscience' pushes him to turn in Dreyer, he understands that procedure of interrogation and imprisonment well enough to know that Dreyer will die soulfully where Wiesler has grown. <br/><br/>With the expected craft the story has made us come to expect, the subsequent story lines are resolved. With a running time of 137 minutes, the film flashes by quickly largely because of it's intense hold of viewer attention through superior emotional arcs. <br/><br/>The final fifteen minutes, in comparison to the film's whole, seem tacked on as we jump through time to the fall of the Berlin Wall, then again two years to the final passive impacts of Wiesler and Dreyer's on each others lives. This is forgivable -even appreciated- because it acts as the literary equivalent of an afterward. In an engaging, resonate novel it is a matter of course to read that section and so here too, finding out what happens to the character beyond the unity of time and space registers more satisfying then cumbersome. <br/><br/>With seven Lola's this year in Germany and praise at major film festivals world wide, this film is a formidable opponent for the best Foreign Language Oscar against Pan's Labyrinth and Water. With methodically crafted direction, an amazing cast, beautifully fitting cinematography, and an delicate sound screenplay, this film deserves all of the praise it is given."
"pedrodebiasi","7","6","15","22 December 2007"," The most overrated film of the latest Oscar.
","It is overrated because critics talked about a poignant masterpiece, and it ended up being just a well-done yet trivial political drama. When it gets to the Academy, I have quite a lot to talk about. In this highly personal review, I have to discuss the Oscar thoroughly, since ""The Lives of Others"" won the 2007 award for Best Foreign Language Film, in a monstrously unfair prize. Have I seen all the other contenders? No, but I've seen one, that being ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and the quality of it is so superior to this overrated German production that the latter should't have even been nominated beside the former.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad movie. On the other side, all the buzz around it (the Academy Award, high scores at the IMDb site, superlative reviews) made me expect a flawless work of art, while this is just a good political drama. There are many average things in ""The Lives of Others"", enough to make it pretty much like a trivial movie. The screenplay has plenty of redundancies (the fingerprint, some over-explicative lines, the excessive ending), sign of a cowardice that aims for giving lazy audiences a circular, closed plot. Many explanations are passable, and most of them weaken the narrative, which could allow mystery and admittedly unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Another problem is the lack of rhythm of director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck. The first hour is incredibly slow, focusing only in the spied couple, and, all of a sudden, things start to happen every minute, to maintain the grasp that wasn't achieved in the previous moments. Many of the plot twists are, as already cited, unnecessary, and some are pretty formulaic. For an example, the discovery of a character that knows about the wiretaps, and the encounter, where a plan unravels, is derivative from countless movies. Another case is that of Wiesler's trajectory: far from his unexplained fascination on Dreyman and Sieland, the big issue about his character is the ending. That kind of redemption is derivative as well, a huge copy of Hollywood's formula (here goes a hint for why the Academy gave the prize to the film)  and the last scene is so artificial that it almost ruins everything that was constructed until there.<br/><br/>While formulaic, trivial and occasionally exaggerated, the screenplay has its assets. Other characters, especially Sieland and Dreyman, have much better conclusions (and the latter's one is the best turning point of the movie, and a strong moment). On the other side, the distinct issue that Georg discovers, because of his friend's death, is not an easy choice to facilitate his decision to publish a critical article. Some dialogs are brilliant, like Wiesler's second interrogatory, which makes an elegant connection with previous lines and delivers tension and even frustration. More tense moments are unevenly scattered throughout the projection, but work wonders, thanks to Donnersmack's good direction, whose highlight is the deft use of the sound: the score is not only distinct, but well-placed. Silences are blended with noisy moments or clean dialogs, and the cork scene is the most relevant one: it marks the time when Wiesler has heard too much.<br/><br/>Wiesler hears all that he needs for his job, but it ends up being too much for his convictions. Something in him tells that the Stasi is wrong, and that Dreyman mustn't be stopped. Some part of him wants to save the couple from the closing menace, and the viewers are not given a straight reason. The best aspect of the screenplay is the unexplained motive, portraying, maybe, Wiesler's own doubt as to what makes him be so fond of those people. Mühe plays this role wonderfully, portraying the spy as a cold man at first (cold but not dead, since he is shown with a prostitute), without many emotions to show. Later, on the other side, his lack of expressions is used to hide feelings. Paradoxically, doubt and confusion are present in his blank face, as if he doesn't dare to feel anything before knowing what it is (the last scene, as bad as it is, confirms that), and that results in beautiful, long takes of his null expression.<br/><br/>Stealing the show every time, Ulrich is the very best cast member, but the others do not disappoint. Koch portrays Dreyman as a great defender of the party in the beginning, but his intellectual mind manages to find, in a strong sentiment of loss, the wit and courage to criticize the system he used to defend, and, ultimately, leaves the doubt: was he just faking his support to Communism, or did he truly believe at its leaders at first? Actually, this asset is more of the screenplay than of the actor, whose work is adequate, never outstanding. In Sieland's role, Gedeck has some beautiful moments, as a woman whose loyalty is always tested, and whose choices are not always altruistic. Her ambiguity appears as strong as Dreyman's, and relates to his in an elegant way. Two other important characters, Paul (Hans-Uwe Bauer) and Albert (Volkmar Kleinert), have small roles (too small, let's say), but amuse because of the first's subtle irreverence and for the second's subtle melancholy.<br/><br/>Had the screenplay tried to avoid stupid clichés, easy resolutions and over-explanation, this would have been a true comment-inducer. As it is, occasional assets cannot hide all the triviality that reigns over in the film. ""The Lives of Others"", curiously, was awarded for following some strict Hollywood rules, and not for being a respectfully distinct foreign film. It is just a good political drama, with some comment on the German History and decent character development. The Oscar shows again how intolerant it is, awarding a good movie while a truly masterpiece like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is put aside because of its daring format. The Academy proves that it doesn't praise originality, nor even quality, but adequacy to its prehistorical single-mindedness."

","Before I saw this movie I watched a discussion on TV between the director Donnersmarck and an Eastern German actor (Henry Hübchen). Hübchen had accused Donnersmarck of having directed an American tearjerker instead of doing an authentic film on how it was to live in a state where you were being watched 24/7. The discussion on TV was quite arduous and I recall Donnersmarck calling Hübchen a hypocrite. So, when I went to watch this movie I bore in mind the discussion I had seen on TV and I looked out for Hollywoodish elements in the film. <br/><br/>My conclusion: Hübchen is not all together wrong. The way Donnersmarck arranged the film it at times seems overly dramatic to me and I have a hunch that Donnersmarck was trying to turn this film into some sort of Greek tragedy, where everything leads up to the final scene in which the Gedeck character is killed/ commits suicide. I imagine that being spied on in the GDR (German Democratic Republik) was devastating and terrifying (especially for an artist) but I don't think that the film itself was very realistic. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, it was beautifully conceived and acted out well, but all the time I thought I was watching a tragedy written by Racine or Corneille and turned into a movie by Donnersmarck. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I disagree with Hübchen. I think a film as good as this deserves every appraisal it can get because if once you see a good German film you have to cut the filmmaker some slack for minor slips as long as the film is entertaining. And this film is entertaining. I enjoyed every scene of it and I was immediately seized by the suspense and thrill of it. So thank you, Mister Donnersmarck for a good German film and keep em coming."

","I heard from my friend and from the press that DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN is a must see. I am surprised that it had such a great success inclusive the Oscar for the best foreign language movie. The story hits no doubt a very important theme of nowadays that let even me a little bit shocked at the end. The running time therefore is too long and some scenes too slow paced that could have been cut. The sceneries and the atmosphere took me really back at the end of the eighties years. The actors especially Ulrich Mühe did a great job. For all these reasons I give with my wife a solid 5/10. I think it's too overrated on this site. If you liked it I recommend the other German documentation DER UNTERGANG that is much more thrilling and not so boring as THE LIVES OF THE OTHERS."
"dromasca","8","3","6","25 December 2007"," different perspectives
","I am born and have lived much of my life in communist Romania. There is a difference I think between the way I and other like me have received this film and the way it was received by folks who were born or lived most of their lives in countries where dictatorship is known only from news, books or films. The very existence of a repressive police machine that supervises every aspect of private lives, that suspects and follows its citizens with the purpose of detecting any act or tendency of political disobedience, up to intervening brutally in their lives may be news for the occidental viewer, but not for us.<br/><br/>On this revelation for the unsuspecting viewer is based part of the impact of 'Das Leben der Anderen'. Another side of the secret is the human story, the story of good people in the bad 'democratic' republic of Germany. Geor Dreyman (acted by Sebastian Koch) is a successful writer who succeeds to become successful and to live a reasonable style of life by compromising in his play-writing of theater about factories and workers. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a Sasi captain who receives the mission to supervise Dreyman, not so much because of political reasons but more because a Communist minister wants to eliminate him as a rival to the favors of his beautiful actress girlfriend. Paradoxically, the two, although no strangers to the limitations of the regime are also the only true believers in the movie, trying to find its good parts, and to match them with their own personal ideals. However, the totalitarian brand of socialism practiced behind the Iron Curtain is nothing but a police system trying to keep in power the party dictatorship, and the only way to be true to the personal ideals is the the two characters to commit treason. Dreyman will write a 'subversive' article and send it to the West, Wieser will secretly cover him and will reveal to no one the dissident change in the writer's approach, at the risk of his own career.<br/><br/>There are at least two memorable scenes in the film. Inone of them a young Sasi officer tells a political joke, and is being heard by one of his superior. The boss plays a cruel game with him, threatening him to destroy his career and then apparently joining him with the laughs. We do however see later that the forgiveness was apparent, when in a later scene we find the young officer sent to a lower grade of work by opening and reading private mail of the citizens, together with Wieser, punished for his lack of vigilance in the Dreyman case. It is however no usual day, it is the day the Berlin wall fell, and we see the Stasi officers whose role was suddenly canceled abandoning their place of work and exiting from the dark underground room to the outside world.<br/><br/>I liked less the general conception of the movie, which tries to satisfy the needs of commercial cinema. It looks like made with the Oscar for the foreign film in mind, and it actually got it. The final scenes that happen years after the fall of the Communism, and try to provide some kind of forgiveness and especially the very last scene seemed very untrue to me. The suffering and scores of lives destroyed by the communist regimes in Eastern Europe scarcely deserve this kind of forgiveness."

"Quinoa1984","9","3","6","11 March 2007"," a strikingly human suspense-drama about the changes that can come in good people
","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has here one of the better debut features I've seen in recent years, and until the last ten minutes has on his hands a tough, powerful gem out of Germany. His film brings memories of films like the Conversation, where a surveillance man got changed into a paranoid, The Trial, where the stark, bleak, disparaging mood strikes a chord in every facet of life, and even to a lesser degree the Pianist, where there can be some spark of goodness reached at men in the dead mess of bureaucracy through the power of art, and human expression. So much that we see the East German socialists do, the ones in the highest ranks of over-dominant power, is to make sure everyone is in check by means of fear and tactics of interrogation and surveillance, in The Lives of Others concerns why certain basic freedoms are important, especially in the arts, and that change is not only possible, but paramount for people in bad circumstances.<br/><br/>Such is the case for Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gerdeck), who get put under suspicion for possible co-horting with undesirables (i.e. those of the 'West', and conspirators against the state, not always thinking in the party-lines in short), and get put under constant audio surveillance by the State, specifically agent Weiseler (Ulrich Muhe), who is so detached that he doesn't even have a grin at a joke at the expense of the head of state made by an underling. But as he listens more and more to these people, and their own personal struggles (Christa's unfortunate liaisons with a slob of a minister played by Thomas Thieme), and to how they react to a good friend's suicide- by playing a touching Beethoven tune on the piano- he starts to question what he's doing. Can a man who really listens to this music be good, is asked rhetorically by Georg after playing it. This, plus the whole aspect of change, which is mentioned early in the film, becomes the emotional and suspenseful core of the picture; Georg gets help in smuggling an article about suicide he's written- for which he can't put his own name- and Wiesler becomes an accomplice, but to him for what are the right reasons.<br/><br/>So what starts out as a tale with possible intonations of espionage or whatever turns into a morality story, and where the personal and political meet at different levels but with similar significance. Can one's duty to one's country's methods and ideals be as crucial as expression in art, music, acting, writing? Donnersmarck's thesis is that, more than anything, change, and the choice to change, is a part of this as well, not just for Wiesler, but for Georg, who decides to go out on a very dangerous limb and not only write the article on an illegal typewriter but to send it out with his friends to the West, but Christa as well with her priorities for 'getting by' in this world. She might be a popular actress, but the price she pays is just as dear as he does, and as Georg witnesses a fellow writer go over the edge as part of the 'statistics', it becomes too much. It's a very potent point about the nature of people in this part of the world at that time that being an individual gains much more to the human spirit than rigidly following a set of rules. Whether or not this is based on a true story or not is irrelevant, because, usually, Donnersmarck gets truthful performances from his actors (especially the subtle Muhe) and is true to how it plays out in sort of a triangle fashion.<br/><br/>Now, to say 'usually' because his film isn't completely flawless. The last ten or so minutes, a denouement where everything is made tidy and neatly put together in a sort of contrived way, goes too long and feels out of place with the rest of the picture. Maybe there's much to say about what ambiguity can do, but that would have been more appropriate for what preceded it than the sweet ending that comes out where bittersweet would have done just fine (i.e. ending it right when the Berlin wall falls). Yet, the catharsis, while not totally satisfying, doesn't make things completely cheapened for the experience, which overall is gripping and touching in the ways that matter. One feels for all of the characters, save for those in the high ranks of power like the Minister and Grubitz, especially when Wiesler reaches out for saving just a small piece of humanity in such an oppressive and hopeless civilization. In short, Donnersmarck is definitely a new filmmaker to watch."
"jjsemple","10","3","6","10 February 2007"," Morality tale about state hypocrisy in the form of a thriller
","As I read further into AO Scott's recent review of this film, I became aware of its resemblance to another great German film. So I had to see it.<br/><br/>Perhaps, you've seen it too; its theme is strikingly similar to ""The Lives of Others."" It's called ""Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam"" (1957). Directed by Robert Siodmak, it stars Hannes Messmer, Claus Holm, and Mario Adorf.<br/><br/>The great thing about this film, and the reason I feel it's so similar to ""The Lives of Others"" -- at least according to the AO Scott rundown and my own take -- is its morality tale about state hypocrisy in the form of a thriller aspect.<br/><br/>An ordinary German police detective, not a Nazi ideologue (Claus Holm) investigates the sex-crime murder of a young woman in Hamburg during the war. As the killer continues to strike with seeming impunity, Holm is convinced that the killings are the work of one man. The case takes a political turn when the Führer decrees that degenerate capitalist abominations such as ""mass murder"" and ""sex criminals"" cannot exist in the morally perfect Reich. Hence the hypocrisy of a mass murdering regime that is loath to permit even the slightest hint of a mass murderer in its midst.<br/><br/>Hannes Messemer, ""The Great Escape"" (1963) & ""Il Generale della Rovere"" (1959) is called in to provide SS oversight on Holm's investigation, i.e., to hush the case up. The Nazis, it seems, would rather have the criminal continue to kill and get away with it than have the facts of the investigation leaked to the public. So the SS decides that the best way to vover it up is to find a fall guy and hang him for the crimes. <br/><br/>In the end, the killer is caught by Holm. To prevent his stellar detective work from coming to light, Holm is sent to the Russian front -- presumably never to return.<br/><br/>Made on Siodmak's return to Germany, after his wartime stint in Hollywood, this is not an easy film to catch, but well worth the effort, especially for those viewers who liked ""The Lives of Others."""

","A film that I was looking forward too, a film that beat both 'Pan's Labyrinth' and 'After the wedding' to best foreign film Oscar at this years ceremony and a film in which I must be missing something. What was this all about? Well I know what it was about, not much, nearly three hours of not much to be precise. Long, grey and boring the cast, especially the Stasi officer (who spend most of the film sat at a desk) must have loved that pay check, quite literally money for nothing. Now there was a nice little thing at the end and the odd bit here and there but that should have taken no more than say twenty minutes to do. Maybe if each showing came with a lecture first filling in the history of the piece it may have been a little different, after all if you didn't live in Germany in 1984 and didn't know all about how the Stasi monitored everyone including each other during that period frequently bugging flats, phones and conducting surveillances then like me you would have been quite lost as the film throws you into to the story. Basically a playwright is being watched by an officer, playwright decides to write some propaganda, officer covers for him because under that evil interrogating exterior beats a heart of grey. That took me less than a minute to write how the hell did they string it out for so long? Anyway this has to be one of the worst foreign films I have seen in a long time, the story is slight, the actors underused, the idea overused and it was just too long. But like I say I might be missing something here as I seem to be in a minority, most reviews have given full stars, one said it wasn't just the best foreign film of the year but the best film period. I'm not sure they see enough films to be honest and I would question if they are actually qualified to do reviews? So in my opinion this really is a case of don't believe the hype and a waste of a golden statue."

","To be taken back to the brown and greyish days of the German Democrat Republic is a fascinating trip, which I enjoyed in the same kind of voyeuristic way as how I imagine Stasi agents followed the lives of the citizens of the Workers State. After watching Das Leben des Anderen, I didn't just feel I had seen a movie about 1980's East Germans, I felt I was a 1980's East German, my blue Peugeout was a lightbrown Wartburg, my lovely wife was an undercover agent. In other words, the movie caught me with its accurate realism.<br/><br/>My few objections go on the ending, and how I feel the director doesn't have much faith in the historical insight of his audience. Not a few times we had to be reminded that Glasnost and die Wände was on its way, so I guess not even Paris Hilton would miss the point. The film was already on the wrong side of two hours, so a couple of the final scenes could easily have been cut out and a little more could have been up the viewer. I have felt this lack of subtility in other German movies and I think it's a shame.<br/><br/>Those are just minor flaws though and it's by far one of the best movies I've seen this year."

","This much-praised film tells the story of a celebrity couple in East Germany being spied on by the government. Koch and Gedeck are too subdued as the couple but Muhe gives a fine performance as the man who listens in on the couple's wire-tapped apartment. The problem is that the film moves very slowly and goes on too long. While the basic premise of the story is interesting, von Donnersmarck (great name!) does little to enliven the film or tap into the potential for suspense. A more talented director could have made this into a fine thriller. A couple of key plot elements are too contrived and some of the actions of characters are unexpected and left unexplained."

Color theory? Actor preferences? Discovery Channel fans? This film had a major inauthentic hole. It is completely PRETENTIOUS to believe that a police investigator changed his attitude towards his work and towards his victims because of his exposure to art, specifically to his exposure to music from Beethoven. Was this a comedy? This film had almost everything else going for it, but the premise was so bogus that it made the rest of the film unforgivable. The acting was good. The scenery gray and tyrannical. The reality of East Berlin was authentic, but once again the premise was NOT authentic. No one, no one changes because they heard a score from Beethoven and or saw a play. They may be affected by that for a little while, but they go back to being themselves thereafter, especially a cold-blooded, career-oriented police investigator from the Stasi. Maybe if he had taken piano lessons for five years he would had changed and had seen his humanity, and the humanity of others, but not because he heard his victims playing a piano piece. BS!!!

","I watched this film quite a while after its release in the Glasgow Film Festival 2007. I had already heard too much about it amounting to an increase of already high expectations. Not only did it live up to them, but it achieved to startle me as much as no other movie, at least this year (possible exception being ""El Laberinto del Fauno"". The film is certainly one of the best (if not the best) film(s) of 2006 and possibly ever. It is an insightful approach to the period of divided Germany. Whereas ""Goodbye Lenin"" gave a nostalgic, emotional and touching view, ""Das Leben Der Anderen"" gives a realist approach not failing to convey the deepest feelings possible and through its excellent performances, its skillful and artful story and directing it assured its position as a unique piece of art. The blending of Brechtian theater, Beethoven's music(& musical critical appreciation) and psycho-politico-social realism achieves a wonderful balance between the Sophoclean tragic determinism and social humanism that will never fail to provoke the deepest thoughts, emotions and idealism. If there are any negative elements at all these would be that it uses (however if any, just a few) some cliché elements and makes some seriously strong claims, the latter of which, however, I think, more than sufficiently supports (I will not go into these for avoidance of spoilers). German contemporary cinema has yet again proved its value and quality to European and international audiences who should in turn return their gratitude."

If I have to rate the film it is a 7 of 10, losing points for it's somewhat lackluster pace and also for it's lack of humor and exciting events until the finale sequence, I hate to say a film is lacking anything because a story is a story and what it has in it, it has in it, but this film wouldn't have suffered from an exciting or pointed moment of tension if the middle of the film.

","I watched this movie only by chance after first reading many eulogies it received among reviewers. As the theme developed and I began to enjoy the immediacy of the plot I slowly realized this wasn't quite the sensitive searching look back upon a failed social experiment I'd been led to believe. As you would expect modern performers are convincing actors - I think the sharpness and no frills approach of modern TV drama has over the years lifted the profession anyway. Can anyone imagine how long an temperamental Joan Crawford type of artist would last in today's climate! The plot whilst rather transparent was adequate. As it developed and later seemed to hinge upon the DDR suicide issue I could see the female lead was probably doomed - but then I remembered another real life suicide 'urban myth' from my younger days. In those days Sweden was (somewhat irritating for certain quarters) successful in its social policies. Its 'progressive' politicians with their caring 'populist' internal behavior and humane foreign approach won a great deal of admiration - after a while assertions started circulating in the media. ""Ah yes but""...suddenly it seemed they had the highest suicide ratings in the world - seemingly there was insufficient excitement in Swedish lives. Boredom caused them to dive under buses, jump into rivers and hang themselves under bridges. Hmmm! I expected an intelligent and genuine examination of a top/down flawed new approach to Societies problems - a filmed reversal of the many failed attempts over thousands of years to overthrow the stifling elites by revolt from below. I'm afraid this movie is being hailed by the same people who convinced me that Obama saw things in a different light....his was a new approach....the tone is certainly different but nothing has altered. 'The lives of others' is yet another example - you've seen it before, nothing is changed it is just another predictably praised - I noticed for instance Wm Buckley and one of the Podhoritz clan - two of the foundling godfathers of the NeoCon mafia lauding it as 'The greatest movie I've ever seen' in one case and 'One of the greatest movies ever made in the other'. We've been conned again I'm sorry to say it's just another 'Commie Bashing' production.

"manuel-pestalozzi","5","6","19","8 December 2008"," Interesting but flawed
","What I like about this movie are the sets, the locations and the editing. As a viewer I could really believe that I am looking into Eastern Germany in the 1980s. The wiring and the ensuing connection between the artist's flat and the cold, drafty attic with the listening post perfectly showed the perverseness and the absurdity of that particular totalitarian system. The highlight for me was, when a guest in the apartment, an enthusiastic journalist from the West, pops the cork of a bottle of champagne. The cork hits a light switch in which a hearing device is hidden, a very quick and short cut to the attic shows how the guy with the headphones winces in silent pain. The movie also makes it very clear that the Socialist systems outmaneuvered themselves with their paranoia  what remains of them are vestiges of Russian style secret service systems (but that is older then Socialism and probably has little to do with it).<br/><br/>What I dislike about this movie is primarily that it is designed as a melodrama. The story is by nature an obscure one. The actions are stealthy ones, almost all that happens happens in the dark. This is transformed into long epic scenes which might attract a mass audience but do not fit the subject matter. I found the overbearing (and often praised) musical score hard to stand. In order to appreciate a melodrama you have to identify with the characters. And this I could not do. It must be said that the people who in this movie were the victims were also people of that totalitarian system. They were successful artists who made a career. They knew amply well how to play"" that system and basically supported it. I am sure it was a great privilege to live in a spacious flat in the center of Eastern Berlin. The victims are not half starved idealistic artists who would die for an ideal, they are rather  let's face it  fat cats with a healthy sense for survival. I found their intellectual whining rather sickening. One has to assume that with such a privileged lifestyle it was easy to generate jealousy in members of the surveillance squads (and I am certain this was systematically, tactically done). Therefore it is difficult to believe in the development of goodness"" in the main character. The movie intimates that it is triggered by music the listener hears in the apartment. I did not find that very convincing."

Yes, now, just after seeing this, I guess it's a bit over-hyped. But that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Please note that I live in Hungary (you know, highest suicide rates... even after 20 years, we still are in the top 10) so I've seen a lot of films dealing with agents, stasi, both dramas, comedies, or comedic dramas. Because of this, maybe I've seen this film a bit differently.<br/><br/>For an average movie-goer, where Lives of Others mostly fails is the original, film-like dramatic storytelling. Most of the plot twists can be guessed. Supporting characters, and even some not-so-supporting, are one-dimensional. Dreyman remains totally uninteresting. But surprisingly, in this movie, this is the part, that is the less important one. <br/><br/>Lives of Others is probably the one, and icon-like movie every post-communist country should make, not for the global market, but for themselves. Dealing, and accepting the past, that the dictatorial system wasn't built up of some leaders, not even party members, but thousands of people, is a trauma, that we couldn't accept until now. Where Lives of Others truly shines, is the completeness of the story. Revealing all the sides, all the emotions, figures and personalities around an institution like the STASI, and this is the point. Not the actual story.<br/><br/>I'm glad that it had an impact like this in the USA - as anyone can read from comments, most of the Americans taught that a communist nation was an absurd, funny, sometimes hard, but overall likable system. I truly hope this movie will shed some light on something else.<br/><br/>Please give a minute thinking of the fact, that in these countries lived millions of Dreymans."

","""The life of Others"" was the last film that I have seen. It's about short period of life of German writer-dissident and his lover who was popular actress when Stasi decide to control them. Also it's a story of spy's life and destiny. The film take place in East Germany, in the middle of eighties. The main topic is hidden struggle with the communist regime. Somebody can say that this movie it's too long and it's make it boring. But I think that Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck, director of this film, made everything correct. Love, hope, struggle, suffering, compassion - everything are in ""The life of others"". We can see how people try to change situation in country and which price they need sometimes to pay for this. And the most powerful moment of this movie it's, of course, unexpected ending. Freedom cannot be stopped but nobody says that you can do it without victim. So when you are tired from pointless thrillers and unfunny comedies and when you want see really emotional drama - try ""The life of Others""."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","17 March 2008"," Mature, engaging and thoughtful drama across many aspects
","In 1984 East Germany is ruled by the Stasi, the secret police whose goal is to know everything and root out any signs of disloyalty to the ruling party. Whenever writer Georg Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria are placed under suspicion the Stasi are put on surveillance duty over his whole life, the task being given to one of their most trusted and experienced men, Captain Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler learns of the true motivations behind the surveillance and at the same time finds himself more and more drawn into the lives of Sieland and Dreyman from his unseen vantage point.<br/><br/>The few critical remarks on this page have mainly focused on one aspect of the film  its pace. I will concede that the film moves quite slowly and that those looking for ""Enemy of the State"" type thrills will be disappointed. However this is more to do with them as viewers rather than the film because for the majority of us the ""slowness"" will be patience and the lack of action set pieces just leaves more room for character and plot development. What it then manages to do is all the more surprising for being the directorial debut of writer/director von Donnersmarck, the outcome is a solid and satisfying story that may not make everything clear as day but in not doing this it actually respects the viewer rather than disappointing them.<br/><br/>At essence the story starts about the surveillance mission but, much in the same way as Wiesler is drawn in, the viewer find the attention then split between the characters, all of them on quite an equal footing. The themes of power and ""good"" are explored within the characters in ways that I found to be interesting, challenging and very well done. It is usually a mark of a good film that one is still thinking about it a few days later (well, apart from some films that are so bad I'm still thinking murderous thoughts about them days later!). Donnersmarck has done very well as writer to build the themes into the nature of the characters and their stories so that repeat viewings or reflections on the film provide more of interest. His direction is strong as well, producing strong shots that stick in the memory and also make good use of the sets.<br/><br/>The cast are roundly good. Mühe is the main one that people draw attention to and rightly so as his grey little man manages to fascinate with few words or direct actions. Gedeck is good but in a different way as her character carries much more of the weight in regards the pressure of the Stasi and also the thoughts over the morality of her character  she brings these out well. Koch is not quite the presence I had wanted as I found him a bit bland but yet still serviceable in the character. Support is suitably menacing from Tukur and Thieme and the cast doesn't really have a weak link in it.<br/><br/>Overall then an excellent and mature film that deserves the praise and the awards it has garnered. Those complaining that it is ""slow"" are correct in their statement but I do not agree with it as a criticism  just an observation of the pace. Instead the steady delivery allows for the gradual development of characters, story and themes that are surprisingly rich, engaging and ultimately satisfying. One of those films that provides food for thought for some time after viewing."

","but I really liked this movie. the main character is so lovable in his strange way and contrary to what I have gleaned tiptoeing through some reviews here I felt his evolution through the film made sense. I'll take some points away for the sort of necessity of it being the case that the party people couldn't get any decent T&A whereas the artists are always provided with the piece of pie. I think XX35 or whatever he was called would make someone a nice husband. As for the other party villain, well... given his position I think he could do a little better himself than what he had to settle for. anyway their lack of charisma did assist the plot on its plotting way and/or set the mood as the case may be. <br/><br/>the film has that bluishgreenish German movie from the 80s look which I think was of course right for this movie, so it looked good to me. I see people here ragging on the visuals too. get over it girls the camera was used well so what if it wasn't hallmark cardworthy every minute! <br/><br/>(and it was way better than pan's labyrinth which was a horrible ordeal to watch when it wasn't being a total insult to your intelligence as far as I'm concerned.)"
"auberus","8","2","4","11 April 2007"," Slow yet intense...Minimalist yet full of emotions
","Das Leben der Anderen (aka the Lives of Others) by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck delves the audience in the atmosphere of East Germany at a time when the word Freedom was defined by the Communist Party. <br/><br/>Mainly shot in the old Stasi Headquarter the film manages to provide as much for the protagonist as for the audience the coldness of both the feeling and decorum.<br/><br/>Through ""Das Leben der Anderen"" Mr. von Donnersmarck represents a new generation of German filmmakers who try the ""reconquista"" of their own History, proposing a reflection on the long separation of the two Germanys. The story takes place in the early eighties in East Germany where the successful auteur George Dreyman and his lover, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland are considered to be part of the intellectual elite even though they don't share the communism ideal.<br/><br/>""Das Leben der Anderen"" is a slow movie but never a boring one it builds up tension while developing multitude of thematic. Beside the obvious denunciation of a system which is indeed falling, the film talks about ""love"" and how the love of art can sometimes be stronger than the physical one or how individual are in essence individualistic.<br/><br/>Serve with a terrific cast ""Das Leben der Anderen"" is a cinematic achievement. Ulrich Mühe knows how to express feeling with minimal words but an expressive visage, Sebastian Koch understands the term ""character embodiment"" and the very sexy Martina Gedeck makes herself desirable and so profoundly human.<br/><br/>Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck manages to describe a dark period in a non Manichean way. He explores through an efficient scenario a troubled History with no complex, realism and humanity. Das Leben der Anderen is a sincere movie and true cinema is indeed about sincerity."

","Best film I have seen in years. It deserved to win Best Picture and not just Best Foreign Film at this year's Academy Awards. <br/><br/>Beautifully written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who deserves to get as much, if not more, credit that the actors, who were all quite good.<br/><br/>Despite the initially depressing setting of Eastern Germany before the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, this is ultimately a life-affirming movie.<br/><br/>I would be loathe to review any of the plot details, because it is the way in which the story unfolds that makes it so incredibly beautiful."
"knowledgeableviewer","10","2","4","1 April 2007"," Do the Westerners really, truly understand what they are looking at?
","Let me start by expressing awe and admiration for the creators of this movie. My hat off to them. Whether the message they are attempting to convey is really heard by the Western audience as it was obviously intended by the creators is however debatable, at least for me.<br/><br/>Along the lines of my doubt, I was amused by one of the otherwise knowledgeable and coherent commentators' line who apparently sincerely believes that ""The most recalcitrant"" were being ""(can be) kicked out of the country and stripped of their citizenship, like the singer songwriter Wolf Biermann."" My God: I lived in a very similar system and my dream, all my friends' dream was to be ""kicked out"". They would not do it because they would have been left with very few people on their hands. Man, do you comprehend that these people were living in a prison? Yes a very large prison but well walled in. That's what the Berlin wall was: a prison wall, with guards and towers and all. Wolf Bierman like a very few others were exceptions and this is not the place to explain why.<br/><br/>It is however the place to express a certain doubt about the possibility of the ""humane"" Stasi so convincingly portrayed. Although I admit the necessity of the character for the drama to make it as captivating as it is, I cannot help knowing that people who were reaching the very important position of bugging such a key character as this great and popular playwright, were thoroughly tested, completely brain washed individuals, convinced to the bottom of their being that what they were doing was right, progressive, for the good of their people and their country, that they were part of the elite called upon to lead back to the right path those who had not yet seen the light that they have seen. His job was particularly important because he was supervising the very creators of the all-important brain washing, called euphemistically, ""socialist education of the masses"".<br/><br/>This is the terrifying thing about the entire system: it drags in intelligent, nay, brilliant people who become the blind tools of oppression. Most of those who have grown up in a free country are convinced that they are not going to be, cannot be victims of such a huge scale scam. To quote no other than the great Friedrich Hayek, what a ""fatal conceit""!! He used it in a slightly different context but it is perfectly applicable here. Just read the comments of those who think that anti-terror surveillance and totalitarian oppression are comparable or even identical. These people are the ones who are most prone to become Stazis, the human material from which they were being recruited. Let's hope that they never get their way."

","At the time of my writing this, there were slightly over 8,100 people voting and 87% of those gave it either a 10, 9, or 8.<br/><br/>After seeing ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" I thought it was robbed when the BFF Oscar was awarded to ""Lives of Others."" <br/><br/>But I saw LoO last night and my judgment is that, while they're both great movies (although of different types), ""Lives of Others"" was justly honored. <br/><br/>IMO, many of the characters in LoO were more nuanced, developed and changed over time; -- there were believable maturational developments of several characters in it; -- it accurately captured psychological conflicts and reactions; -- it captured the historical quality of that era of the GDR more accurately than PL did for an era 6 years after the end of the Spanish Civil War; and -- it has many haunting parallels with today's issues (interrogations, rendition, domestic surveillance, the fact that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the slighting of ideals for public good for private gain all the while maintaining the drumbeat of patriotism). <br/><br/>The plot's twists and turns kept me in suspense but were always reasonable. (And I'm a retired therapist and displeased by unlikely reactions.)<br/><br/>ALL the actors were excellent with the central character, Wieser, the brightest star among many.<br/><br/>As a summary review in ""The New Yorker"" said, you leave this movie feeling surprisingly uplifted.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, I suggest you visit the IMDb Message Board threads where you'll find many Q&As, discussions about this movie."
"drfraud-1","9","2","4","10 January 2007"," Powerful and emotional. Brilliant script
","Das Leben der Anderen is an incredibly emotional movie that portrays the live behind iron curtain in the Federal Republic of Germany.<br/><br/>We discover a life of a couple that is being watched by the East German secret police and how struggle for basic human freedom prevails for some, but fails for others. There are no real protagonists in the story, just the characters whose lives interconnect and people that watch them. So in effect, it is the story of people that strive and those that watch them do so. The storyline and script the movie is based on are very powerful. The music adds to the mood and overall presentation is amazing and will keep you hooked until the end. This along with other German movie, Der Untergang are by the far the best masterpieces of cinematography that came out of Germany in a long time. There are however certain things I was left not 100% satisfied with such as somewhat amateur camera work and certain scenes that were poorly edited, but they can really be ignored when looking at the movie as a whole. 9/10"

","Today I watched the film for the second time along with my friends. After so many years, most details of the film have faded away from my memory, leaving only blurring sihouelletes. The altruism of the Stasi agent is one of the only impressions that remained unwashed before the revisit. However, this time what attracted my attention was not only the heroic act of Wiesler, but more keenly on the living state of those who suffered from a Orwellian society that they had no power nor courage to change.<br/><br/>The main factor that may have reshaped my impression towards the film is my visit to North Korean last year, a regime whose first name is also ""Democratic"". As a consequence, I have had this surreal experience while those characters are walking around those bleak stone buildings in the dead of night, since I have also tried, albeit the discouragement of my guide, to take a walk on the street in Pyongyang after dinner. The tram, the quiet pedestrians who walked around, the deadly atmosphere were somewhat ignited in me, though most of them do not really bear any resemblance to the scenes in the film. My guide panicked after my disappearance from the hotel for about 15 minutes and summoned a few other guides to search for me. I was duly admonished on being found, and reminded that secret police might also be wandering the streets at the same evening, expecting an unexpected encounter with some hapless tourists who dare to step outside the prescribed realm. I was only to learn the story of Otto Warmbier after my brief adventure into the heart of DPRK, which gave me quite a shock when I look back at some of my casual behaviors that could have been perceived as disrespectful.<br/><br/>I have gone on a tangent line here. I don't think it's a movie review anymore."

","This is seriously one of the best movie I've ever watched.
Everything, from the original plot, the screenplay, photography, soundtrack and acting, was perfectly conceived and realized. There was no line which I thought was redundant or avoidable.
From the start of the movie, you are directly immersed into the living conditions of the DDR. The way STASI worked makes you realize that there was no thing such as personal space and freedom of thought.
It is then perfectly depicted what it really means being an artist inside this historical context.
I was not bored for one single second during the whole movie, and after having watched it dubbed in Italian, I also tried to watch it in German. Every character was really well portrayed, and the acting was simply superb.
It saddened me to read that Ulrich Mühe died only one year after the movie was released. His interpretation was outstanding, and the last line he pronounces ""Es ist für mich"" is so full of power after everything his character goes through.
I highly recommend not to miss this title!"

","For all The praise The world has heaped on ""The lives of others,"" if anyone must jump up and say that ""The lives of others"" is a failure, it is probably The director of The former east German prison museum. Without the curator, however, the film's most important significance would not have emerged. This is a movie that must be seen in contrast, and only when you compare historical facts with the film can you still sit still, speechless and shocked after watching the movie, and understand the true cruelty.
The story is set in 1984 - not a year of choice for anyone who has read George Orwell's political fable 1984 - when the loyal and ruthless east German secret police, wiesler, after watching a play, offers to spy on the playwright derriman. Weisler's request coincides with that of the minister of culture, who has his eye on the beautiful actress krista, derriman's wife, in an attempt to find dirt through surveillance and coerce krista into satisfying his own desires. Weisler's psychology and motives are much more complex. On the one hand, he finds deraman ""suspicious"" because of the secret police's fearsome omnipresent sense of smell.
Weisler and another secret police officer alternated shifts to monitor the dreymans around the clock. What weisler did not expect, however, was that his humanity gradually recovered during the eavesdropping. He took a volume of brackett's poetry with him from the playwright's desk and was deeply moved by it; He burst into tears when he heard deraman's emotional piano playing on the monitor. Just as derriman began secretly and anonymously writing reports to the west German media about east German suicides, weisler chose to sacrifice his career to protect them. He sends off another police officer on duty, a man who listens in on the dreymans and fabricates surveillance reports, and ends up helping the playwright avoid a huge disaster in the middle of a crisis. Weisler was demoted to the basement as a messenger boy, and after the change, he still lived at the bottom of the social ladder as a messenger delivering free ads.
""The lives of others"" swept The German awards, winning best European film, actor of The year and screenwriter of The year, and winning The Oscar for best foreign language film. Indeed, it has all the elements that the oscars love: east Germany, suspense, the resurgence of humanity, the triumph of good over evil... All in all, the story of a killer in love, an east German version of Leon, the American genre. But is this really the case? Of course, it's fair to say that weisler, who at first seems as cold as steel, is too quick and easy to turn his humanity around, and that the film's treatment of this point seems to be less than rigorous, but is it just that?
Donashmark, director and screenwriter, has been making his feature film debut at the age of 33, the lives of others, after nine years of preparation. When the film was shot, he got the help of many former east germans, and was able to film in many of the former east German government buildings. The only person who turned down his request was the director of the former east German prison museum. Why? Because, says the curator, the play is historically incorrect: throughout east German history, there were no ""conscience-conscious"" secret police like Mr Wiesler, sorry, none.
Yes, this is the truth of the matter, this is the most significant and powerful shock that it reveals: that the killer is not emotional, that humanity is not revived, that good does not triumph over evil. Donashmark said he wanted to show people back then that you have a choice. The truth is, no one chooses conscience. The warmer the movie, the harsher the reality. Donashmark is still too young and naive. He should have finished the film with the subtitles and told the audience that this tenderness never existed, this wish never came true. In this way, the film is complete, just, enough."

","Set primarily in the 80s, 'The Lives Of Others (2006)' tells the story of a writer who finds himself on the wrong side of the East German government via the man whom has been assigned to listen into his every word. The movie is interesting in that we're essentially watching someone watch someone. Each story can only exist within the context of the other, which leads to a complex and mature experience that touches on resonant themes of privacy, loneliness and personal freedom. The protagonist is a bit of a blank slate. However, as he slowly becomes more and more invested in the lives of those he monitors, he definitely undergoes a full character arc. The movie itself is often surprisingly suspenseful, brilliantly constructed to eek the most out of each potential moment of tension. Its main asset is, I suppose, its natural dramatic irony, which is used wonderfully throughout. Sometimes, the thing is a little too slow for its own good. It also has an extended denouement that seeps the life out of its otherwise superb climax. These final moments do provide a nice bit of closure but they mostly recycle old information and don't feel efficient at all. The decision to end on, essentially, a joke is questionable, too. Still, the piece is an entertaining and effective thriller overall. 7/10"

","'The Lives of Others' is an interesting movie.

Instead of reporting him, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler - who is in charge of the investigation - can't wait for his surveillance turn to follow Georg's life. Wiesler is excellently portrayed by Ulrich Muhe. One can't help but become absorbed by the characters, wanting to see and hear more.<br/><br/>There's so much irony in the film.

","One of the best movies on the subject of loyalty (to loved ones or ideals) and betrayal. Set in East Berlin a few years before the fall of the Wall.<br/><br/>People on the wrong side of the Wall still live like in the 60s, very few lights at night and cars around in bleak East Berlin. The gloomy atmosphere is compounded by the dreaded surveillance by the STASI, of which we meet rising operative star Gerd.<br/><br/>Thanks to his friendship with a higher ranking official, Gerd gets the prestigious job of spying on playwright Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Sieland. The excuse is that Dreyman is suspected to be a Western sympathiser, even if everything he writes is above board.<br/><br/>The truth is that fat, ugly and nasty culture minister Hempf is shagging his girlfriend and wants to get rid of the competition.<br/><br/>Soon, the dry, introverted Gerd starts to have feelings for the couple and tampers with his reports. Unfortunately, Dreyman and Sieland manage to get into big trouble. Being a fragile, abused woman, Sieland is the first to go down. In a scene comparable to Winston's betrayal of Julia in 1984, Sieland spills some beans.<br/><br/>Will she survive as a STASI informer? Will her beloved Dreyman suffer dreadful consequences?

","I'm not going to lie. I knew little about what happened after WWII in Germany. All I knew was that Germany was split in half, the West was made into a democracy, while the East was strictly Communist. And in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, signifying the reconstruction of one unified German state.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" begins near the end of the conflict, where the East has maintained a very strict gripping on what the people are to read or write (just as China and Russia had.) The opening scene, one of the best intro's to a movie I have seen this decade, tells us of how the Stasi, the secret police of the East Germany, which is referred to in the film as the German Democratic Republic, obtain information about escapees (to the West) not by brutally, but by petty tortures.<br/><br/>The opening sets the stage for what to expect throughout the movie, or you would think. Without giving any of it away, this movie never plays out in a formuliac manner. Many could inherently link this movie with ""The Conversation,"" the 1974 movie by Francis Ford Coppola, but this movie far surpasses even that one.<br/><br/>See for yourself why this movie is in the top 100 (a rare accomplishment for a foreign film.)

","This 2007 movie set in 1980s East Berlin earned the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. The film follows the life and times of successful playwright Georg Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria. It provides insight into the machinations of the State Police and efficiency with which an apartment could be wired for sound. Trusted employees wore headphones, made notes and typed up a report of what they heard. It was not recorded on tape. Untrustworthy employees, we found out later, were stuck in the post office basement steaming open envelopes.<br/><br/>Georg, as so many of the art community, was suspected of  well, we're not sure of what he is suspected, but they were out to get him. He never knew, and bragged that his apartment was ""safe"".<br/><br/>At some point, Christa-Maria is made an informant. The psychology of the artistic temperament is explained in a class for interrogators: threaten to take away their audience and they are yours. ""Tell us what you hear or you will never set foot on stage again,"" was a threat that worked.<br/><br/>The State kept records of everything. Because of that it signifies when it doesn't. Georg wrote an essay on suicide in East Berlin for publication in the West. In 1977, the GDR quit keeping track of suicides. That year, only Hungary had a higher rate of suicide.<br/><br/>Forensic science was much simpler then. A sample of everyone's typeface was kept. Subversive literature could be tracked to its source. Unlike today's disposable society, in that place and time if you had a typewriter, that was it. Fortunately, our hero's friends who wanted him to write for the Western publications knew this and brought him a small 'clean' typewriter to use, apologizing that only a red ink ribbon was available. He had a hiding place under a wide door sill where he kept it and his typed copy. Even Christa didn't know his hiding place, as he only worked when she was not there. No one trusted anyone, and for good reason, it seems. His apartment is searched, but nothing incriminating is found.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie she arrives home unexpectedly and catches him with his sill up, red-handed as it were. From that point, any red-blooded American moviegoer could figure out what was going to happen and it did -- but with a twist. I thought that was the end, but wait Two years later the Wall fell. Workers steaming open envelopes passed the radio earpiece to share the news, and then walked off the job.<br/><br/>After the dust settled, Georg checked out his records. Evidently, a person could request his file and wait at a table in a sort of lending library reading room for it to be brought out. George had a huge file with the code name of the person in charge on each report. He was even allowed to identify the person who wired his apartment and listened to his most private conversations and who, in the end, saved him—but not Christa-Maria.<br/><br/>East Berlin looked so spare, harsh and clean. After the fall, the same streets were bustling with traffic and decorated with graffiti.<br/><br/>This movie is a compelling story of love, loyalty, rebellion, betrayal, loss, and redemption."

","I watched this movie because it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film of 2006. This film won over the more high profile ""Pan's Labyrinth"" which recently topped a list of best foreign language films of this decade. Naturally I was very curious to check it out.<br/><br/>The story is set in Communist East Germany in the 80s. It was about the notorious surveillance of the dreaded Stasi on suspected ""enemies of the state."" In this case, Agent Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) was tasked by his superior Grubitz (chillingly portrayed Ulrich Tukur)to spy on the goings-on in the house of prominent playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch)and his girlfriend and lead actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).<br/><br/>However, despite the veteran that he was, Wiesler becomes sympathetically involved in the lives of the people he is supposed to observe. This is especially when it was revealed that the surveillance had been ordered by Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (a very greasy Thomas Thieme), not for national security reasons, but only because he selfishly wanted to get rid of Dreyman in order to have Sieland for himself.<br/><br/>The situation is very claustrophobic and may become boring, but it doesn't. This is a testament to the success of its solid direction by then newcomer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. It also holds the audience's interest because of the very effective acting of the lead actors. The main actor is not Koch nor Gedeck, instead the focus of the movie is on Wiesler, the character played by Muhe. We clearly see his character develop from a heartless government agent and inquisitor into a man who followed his heart rather than his head, and fully accepted the consequences of his actions.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is very good as a study of the political situation in East Germany back then, as well as an excellent character study of the people caught up in this situation. It is worth the time invested to watch it.<br/><br/>Now whether it deserved to win the Oscar over ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" that is a bigger question. Definitely the delivery of the message in ""The Lives of Others"" is simple and direct, while the approach in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is allegorical and metaphorical. Comparing apples and oranges, It boils down to a matter of taste among the jurors who voted. Both films are excellent in their own ways."

","My experience with German cinema is not very vast; the most recent film I saw out of Germany was the excellent DER UNTERGANG, which was good enough to garner a spot in my Top 100. The style of DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN is equally impeccable and it is difficult not to appreciate, regardless of one's taste in film. The story itself is a truly remarkable and unforgettable one; one that will captivate many viewers.<br/><br/>While none of the main characters are one-dimensional (thankfully), the real protagonist of the story is Gerd Wiesler, played by the late Ulrich Muhe. This is easily one of the greatest portrayals I have seen in a while, and the portrayal makes for a great character study. Wiesler is easy to relate to on the surface, but carries with him an air of melancholy, loneliness, and longing. When he spies on the couple, one begins to understand his emotional transformation, as their lives are filled with the things that his life is devoid of: passion, love, art, and desire. They live in a rather lush apartment, while his is more like a motel room than anything, devoid of life and feeling, much like his existence. He ultimately begins to care for the couple and assumes the role of 'Guardian Angel', at the risk of losing his job, and his favour with the Stasi. The scene in which the viewer realises that he chooses to move from detached observer to active participant is gripping and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is superb overall, though I haven't heard of any of the actors before this feature, and the screenplay and cinematography are equally excellent. This is an overall brilliant film; it is intelligent and complex without being overly melodramatic, and manages to speak to the heart with no need for bombastic mind-numbing special effects. My only real regret is that the film opened only as a limited release, and many viewers were thereby deprived of a truly rich and rewarding cinematic experience. I heard that there was an American remake in the pipelines, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with this original, and if one must make an extra effort to see it, it would be worth it. This is quite easily one of the best movies of 2006/2007.<br/><br/>9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 150 at #116. Highly recommended."

","""Before the Fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany's Secret Police Listened to Your Secrets"" <br/><br/>A man who has devoted his life to ferreting out ""dangerous"" characters is thrown into a quandary when he investigates a man who poses no threat in this drama, the first feature from German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. It's 1984, and Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is an agent of the Stasi, the East German Secret Police. Weisler carefully and dispassionately investigates people who might be deemed some sort of threat to the state. Shortly after Weisler's former classmate, Lt. Col. Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), invites him to a theatrical piece by celebrated East German playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) informs Weisler that he suspects Dreyman of political dissidence, and wonders if this renowned patriot is all that he seems to be. As it turns out, Hempf has something of an ulterior motive for trying to pin something on Dreyman: a deep-seated infatuation with Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), Dreyman's girlfriend. Nevertheless, Grubitz, who is anxious to further his career, appoints Weisler to spy on the gentleman with his help. Weisler plants listening devices in Dreyman's apartment and begins shadowing the writer. As Weisler monitors Dreyman's daily life, however (from a secret surveillance station in the gentleman's attic), he discovers the writer is one of the few East Germans who genuinely believes in his leaders. This changes over time, however, as Dreyman discovers that Christa-Maria is being blackmailed into a sexual relationship with Hempf, and one of Dreyman's friends, stage director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert), is driven to suicide after himself being blackballed by the government. Dreyman's loyalty thus shifts away from the East German government, and he anonymously posts an anti-establishment piece in a major newspaper which rouses the fury of government officials. Meanwhile, Weisler becomes deeply emotionally drawn into the lives of Dreyman and Sieland, and becomes something of an anti-establishment figure himself, embracing freedom of thought and expression. A major box-office success in Germany, Das Leben der Anderen (aka The Lives of Others) received its North American premiere at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others can only be described in one word: Hervorragende , which is 'outstanding' in German, I think. Set five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Stasi (or Secret Police) listened to all your secrets, no one is spared. But when a Stasi officer is put to the test, he must decide if whether he must put his job on the line to do what really is right or be lost in the corruption in a poisoned society forever.<br/><br/>The authenticity of the film was top notch which I found very satisfying and top to that a very engaging script and a grim mood & atmosphere. The impressive acting sealed the deal for me with stellar performances from veteran German actors Ulrich Mühe, Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch. Ulrich Mühe, who looks a lot like Kevin Spacey, captivates the audience with his ice steel character and commanding presence. If you're into films from around the world and such, then this is a must-see."

","There seems to have been no shortage of totalitarian Philistines in East Germany after World War Two's housecleaning of the Nazi Party. Soviet Communism had a vast network of secret police and informers to practice their 1984 Big Brother tactics on it's fellow citizens with incredible fervor (Stasi agents) and fear (informers).<br/><br/>In a stunningly subdued portrait of totalitarian repression The Lives of Others presents us with the reality of the Orwell experiment that was East Germany. Grounded in reality it does not have the option to utilize the future as seen through the imaginative eye of a fantasy, sci-fi storey line complete with dazzling pyrotechnics (Brazil, Blade Runner) depicting a 1984 future. Others is more terrifying than that since it took place in the lifetime of most adults living today.<br/><br/>It is indeed 1984 and the Stasi (secret police) still have a firm grip on the long suffering people of East Germany. Repression and censorship is the rule of the day and no dissent is brooked, period. Artists are naturally stifled, yet some manage to get their work staged by playing along with the Party. Playwright, Georg Dreyman is a State fave, but chafes at the treatment of other artists black listed for being more forthcoming. A Beria like culture minister with designs on Dreyman's beautiful actress girlfriend initiates a file on him. Agent Wiesler (brilliantly portrayed by Ulrich Muhe) , a committed and ultra thorough investigator takes up the task. Dreyman believing he is above suspicion writes an anonymous piece for de Spiegel exposing the East and Wiesler has the goods on him. Wiesler's intense observation of Dreyman and co-horts though has exposed him perhaps for the first time in his life to the beauty of art, the preciousness of relationships and the freedom to think as an individual. Could the brainwashed career man be weakening?<br/><br/>Director/writer Florian Herbel von Dommenmarck has made a powerful and important film with Other Peoples Lives. It is a sober, grim telling of what a society is capable of in the firm grip of a police state and the petty venal bureaucrats running it. His overall visual palette ideally captures the drab colorless GDR setting inhabited by anxious citizens and polluting Trabants. It is a joyless world of deep suspicion where neighbors, friends, co-workers, teammates (even Olympic gold medalist Katarina Witt was an informer) are turned against each other. It is society at it's most abysmal. I would make it required viewing for all freedom loving people were it not totalitarian of me to do so."

It is very interesting to see the characters unfold and develop and see who stays a ""flat"" character and in contrast who becomes a ""round"" character. Its interesting to note the various points at which Weisler becomes sympathetic towards Dreyman and his plans. The camera work and attention to detail also helps build up a further enjoyment for this film. It was shot very well and I enjoyed the unique use of color this film choose. It was not flashy and up in your face but it felt like subdued vibrant colors. Very enjoyable for the eye and somehow conveys a mood of control or constant surveillance such as was the case in communist Berlin. Another exciting aspect of this film was the very story itself. Being so unique, there was quite the same I could compare it to which was very refreshing in today's day and age of a seemingly endless trail of the ""same"" movies.

","As an American, I had heard about the Stasi and the degradation of private lives under totalitarian regimes, but this film at last lays it out for all to see. The story is about a couple who are under surveillance and about the people who do the surveillance as well. <br/><br/>Under the GDR as here depicted no privacy is exempt from the grasping paws of party bigwigs. It would appear that ""socialism"" was the first ideal to be jettisoned by politicians aiming at power/career goals or just lusting after flesh. But their devotion to ""socialism"" expresses itself in unlimited zealotry in the violation of privacy in the name of security of the State.<br/><br/>As a result of this unnatural intrusion, trust becomes fractured in every direction. The main character wrongly concludes his wife is willingly unfaithful. The party boss for his part possibly deceives himself that his groping of the woman is somehow not blatant violation.<br/><br/>The tactics of the Stasi are repulsive because of their cynicism. A neighbor who was aware of the Stasi's visit to plant bugging devices is not only threatened but also sent a gift of thanks for her cooperation. <br/><br/>While the couple share a liberating moment in which he promises her that their love will see them through, nevertheless the tactics of the Stasi are successful in perverting her to its purposes. It is a perfect nightmare, a Hell with no escape--and then unexpectedly it ends when the Wall comes down.<br/><br/>What follows is a post mortem of the past by the main character in which he discovers in Stasi records truths about his past relationships that he could not have guessed. Definitely worth seeing."

","This movie probably doesn't need another favorable review but I don't think that will stop me from writing one anyway! What a starkly realistic piece about life, particularly artistic life, in the GDR prior to Glasnost. We in the West take our liberties so much for granted that a movie such as this gives us a well deserved shock to our systems. The film, collectively, and its characterizations, individually, poignantly and meticulously dissects the thoroughly vain, corrupt and nihilistic political system in power during that time. From the thoroughly disgusting Minister Hempf at the power top to the ""victim"" writer/playwright Dreyman, the entire cast excels in a powerfully moving, yet unrushed production. Of particular note is Ulrich Muhe's performance as the stoic (initially!) Stasi captain assigned to snoop on Dreyman. Will we, in fact, see a metamorphosis in this character as the plot evolves? I'll not be a spoiler!<br/><br/>Only one regret: Since I viewed the English subtitled version, I have to assume I missed a lot of the more subtle nuances of the dialogue that usually get lost in even the most ambitious translations.<br/><br/>Rather than recap what other astute reviewers have already noted, I will say that the sequences of events that lead to a most subtle, yet decidedly satisfying conclusion were masterfully executed in an intelligent and artistic fashion. To date, one of the truly premier film gems of the decade. Should be required viewing for contemporary film students worldwide."

The characters are ordinary people, and it is this simplicity that draws the attention of Wiesler, which makes their love for their work becomes an unconditional love to people's lives and their small details that give meaning to their existence.<br/><br/>So an argument, a birthday, a sexual relationship, an ideal, a love of art, causing Wiesler admiration of the relationship of Georg and Maria, an envy of experiencing the same simple pleasures in his gray life, that leads to defend, to risk for them to be like the God of their small existence that manages to retain the balance, so the end (or the last 15 minutes) prove to be a blow to the liver of any spectator, that everything goes free fall and the fragility is present.<br/><br/>I decided not to re-try before know.

","Filmmaker's Purpose.<br/><br/>This film expresses an array of complex characters and concepts, all which are historically intertwined and provocatively motivated by the belief in rebellion. It is the rebellion of those possessing a considerable measure of moral courage that fight against the corruptions of East Germany's secret police in order to establish freedom from tyranny. However, resistance is felt amongst both partiesthose who seek to collapse the socialist movement in East Berlin, and those who seek to maintain the socialist status quo. Each character in the film has something to rebel against. Their rebellion springs forth from a desire to foster progressive attitudes in an ever paranoid community.<br/><br/>Anti-socialist/writer, Georg Dreyman, rebels against the Stasi by publishing a series of suicide rates in the Spiegel report (West Germany). His purpose in doing so is to expose the consequences of what happens when a corrupted government unethically infiltrates the lives of others. Those whose lives are penetrated by the police are driven to madness and eventually suicide. Dreyman's hopes are that the reports will produce a disdainful image on the Stasi and thereby lead to their downfall as well as of the socialist state.<br/><br/>Interrogation agent Wiesler has an internal rebellion throughout the film. His feelings are torn between his loyalty to the state versus his loyalty to his conscience. On one hand, his moral obligation to the state consists of him secretly investigating the lives of anyone suspected of revolutionary ideas. It is his solemn duty to uphold the socialist status quo. On the other hand, however, he feels his life-long service to the state has turned him into some type of hidden monsterone that fears exposure and secretly lurks in the corners of paranoia. His rebellion to become innocent again takes him on a cathartic journey through which he slowly begins to throw off the shackles of conditioned imprisonment that the state has created in his mind.<br/><br/>Actress CMS, Dreyman's girlfriend, is confronted by a series of challenges that lead her to rebel both against her conscience as well as the powers that be. Her life is governed by her art. The art she creates for herself is acting. However, a façade is created in her mind by Minister Hempf that there are limits to her creative powers in how far she can climb in the business. Due to the Minister's high position in government affairs, he threatens her to believe that unless she gives her body to satiate his lusting desires, she will be blacklisted and unable to fulfill her dreams. At first, she rebels against her conscience as well as those who truly love her namely Dreymanand fulfills the wishes of the Minister. Later, after being verbally saved in a bar by agent Wiesler, she comes to her senses and decides that her talent is independently greater than the shallow intimidations of the Minster.<br/><br/>One aesthetical element that contributes to the filmmaker's purpose of rebellion is the directingin particular, the director's choice of choosing the title of the film. Deep implications are found behind thinking about what the lives of others means. The mere observation that the lives of others are being infiltrated and exposed in this community is representative of the paranoia that was still existent during the post-Cold War years. The prevailing and corrupt government was married to this paranoia in consequence of their potential thoughts of losing power over the state. As philosopher Thomas Hobbes once professed, ""Human nature is innately predicated upon self-interest and desires for power."" It was this desire for power that led those in control to rebel against the people in order to maintain the governing status quo.<br/><br/>Symptomatically speaking, humans have always needed something to rebel against in order for them to feel progressively challenged. We, by nature, are problem solvers. If there is not intense opposition attempting to thwart our goals, the definition and feeling of success is eradicated; for success is predicated upon overcoming that which provides severe pressure. As paraphrased in one of the last scenes of the film, the Minister declares to Dreyman after the wall comes down that ""if there's nothing to believe in or rebel against, the people don't grow."" It is through the challenges we face in life that propels us to rebel against the current state, whether literally or figuratively speaking, and through the process become new and refined creatures."

","Das Leben der Anderen is a stunning piece of work. It is flawlessly acted and directed and presents a shady but important part of (East) German history. It is indeed quite relevant as we have seen in recent history regarding the wiretapping incidents. What I found most amazing though is that this was the director's graduation work. We can say that he has definitely passed.<br/><br/>In recent times I have seen other movies that have won a foreign-language Oscar and I have thought that they may have been good, but not great, e.g. Tsotsi, Osama etc. This one, however, fully deserves the Oscar and more.

"natw","9","0","0","14 January 2008"," Excellent depiction of a real-life ""1984""
","It is both fascinating yet somehow disturbing that this movie is about a period in history that seems so far removed from modern times yet takes place barely 20 years ago. Set in 1984 communist East Germany, ""The Lives of Others"" provides us with a behind-the-scenes look at the chillingly efficient Stasi secret police. The depressing tone of such a society is evident throughout, yet we can feel the twinge of hope that hides within its main characters, even the by-the-book secret service captain who has a writer's apartment wired and listens to everything that goes on in his life. A real-life approximation of the kind of repression depicted in the classic novel ""1984"" should give us pause. I thought it especially fitting that this movie does not show us state-sponsored torture, murders or other horrific realities that certainly existed in Stalinist regimes. Instead, the threat expressed to those who would dare speak against the regime involved loss of dreams, such as the theater director being blacklisted or the actress being robbed of her audience. Chillingly, in such a world that offered little hope, that may be a more effective threat than physical pain, or even death itself, which at least removes one from the situation. This is a movie that is not only a splendid piece of film-making, but one that has valuable worth in the real world. Those on the verge of taking freedom for granted would do well to spend two hours taking in this excellent film."

","Te best movie I've seen this year. Touching...And I don't expect that lots of people will understand. Can't understand something you never pass through. This movie is a political thriller and human drama; The action begins in East Berlin in 1984, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and ultimately takes us to 1991, in what is now the reunited Germany. THE LIVES OF OTHERS traces the gradual disillusionment of Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe, a highly skilled officer who works for the STASI, East Germany's secret police. His mission is to spy on a celebrated writer and actress couple, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesler, who has been monitoring all of Dreyman's activities, finally has the proof he needs to destroy his subject and to serve the GDR by foiling Dreyman's plot. But Wiesler's unemotional façade is showing signs of erosion. While he observes the day-to-day life of Dreyman and Christa-Maria, he begins to be drawn into their world. In 1991, two years following the fall of the Berlin Wall, Dreyman learns that he had been the subject of a STASI surveillance. Immediately afterward, he finds the cables and microphones secretly installed years earlier behind the wallpaper in his apartment. In disbelief, he sets out to research and discovers the different reality of his past, which not only has a profound impact on his life but also surprises him with shocking revelations. THE LIVES OF OTHERS is a human drama about the ability of human beings to do the right thin."

","Many viewers of this movie tend to focus on the chilling system of a totalitarian government. But if you remember the revelation every now and then of surveillance and invasion of privacy, all in the name of security, in ""free"" countries that purport to be the world's peace keepers, the impact this ""shock"" factor in ""The lives of others"" may not be that devastating after all. Permit me, therefore, to take a different angle, to focus on the individual rather than the system.<br/><br/>In a way, it can be said that the audience take the POV of top interrogator and surveillance agent in the East Germany Stasi regime, during the gloomy period leading towards the fall of the Berlin Wall. Through around the clock wiretapping (assisted by a subordinate) Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) monitors to the minutest detail everything in the apartment of writer Georg Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria, as artists form a group that the government look upon with acute suspicion. <br/><br/>While being professionally efficient to the point of machine-like, Wiesler is also an ordinary human being. He bullies his subordinate as any boss would. He satisfies his sexual need through regular sessions with prostitutes. But most importantly, as it is slowly and gradually revealed, he has a heart. Through a painful metamorphosis, he becomes his surveillance objects' guardian angle. <br/><br/>This movie is not entertaining in the conventional sense. The mood is gloomy throughout, as underscored by the somber cello in the background. Humorous spots are not entirely absent, but few and far between. Even camera deployment is at its simplest. <br/><br/>And yet, this movie is mesmerizing in its own way, reflecting director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's absolute confidence that the absorbing story and excellent acting will carry the day. The result well justifies his belief. Particularly worth mentioning is the excellence of Muhe's minimalist portrayal of the transformation of an apparently cold-blooded agent to a ""good man"". Also worth mentioning is the minimalist ending, which some may not find satisfying. I, for one, am deeply touched. <br/><br/>With the surprising omission of ""Volver"" from the Oscar Best Foreign Language Film nomination list, ""The lives of others"", with the credentials of the awards it has won to-date, is a strong contender. However, beating ""Pan's Labyrinth"", which comes with equally impressive credentials, is a formidable task."

","Since about 2004, Germany has been producing some interesting films looking at and reworking its history (Sophie Scholl, The Downfall, Napola). This is one of the first 'serious' films to go into the dark aspects of the old East Germany. It's all about the Stasi (secret police) undermining and ruining people's lives, in this case the lives of prominent writers and actors. In the process -- and this is one of the unbelievable parts with no known historical precedent, as far as I'm aware -- the main surveillance person (Ulrich Mühe) warms somewhat to his victims and sees the emptiness of his own life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film muddies the waters by making sex a major motive. This is unnecessary, irrelevant and also without much historical foundation.<br/><br/>It is very well acted by all concerned and successfully conjures up the required atmosphere.<br/><br/>It is one of those very 'small', low-budget German films (like Sophie Scholl) that in Britain would be a TV film and would never make it into a cinema. Presumably for financial and prestige reasons, films like this are shown on general release in cinemas in Germany.<br/><br/>In fact, it does not require a cinema at all, since there is nothing that calls for a big screen.

Perhaps it was a bold drama that made some statement, and if that is what one is looking for than look no further. If one is looking to be enlightened or entertained, look again.<br/><br/>Now, regarding the dramatic look into GDR, what can I say? I am not German, but I am eastern European. My family lived on the other side of the wall and we had to be very careful until the wall came down. Even now, my relatives are careful amongst the party members. Still, they are happy proud people.<br/><br/>I have also stayed in a hotel in Berlin that was very popular East German hotel amongst party elite. Those elite had far different lives.

One issue that the movie brings up is whether or not the events portrayed could happen in any other country...including our own. If so, then it wouldn't be a surprise, as the United States and Soviet Union were basically the same sorts of societies. What the USA did in Latin America, the USSR did in Eastern Europe.

And now, 2019, knowing the other Donnersmark Movies ""The Tourist"" and ""Werk ohne Autor - Never Look Away"" (based on the life of German Painter Gerhard Richter - who hates the film and took distance), I must say, it went downhill for Donnersmark from there.

He engages an officer to bug his house, and find out about his unrevealed secrets.For this work, Wiesler is chosen, who is very good at interrogation as well as at collecting information all by your behaviour patterns. According to me, I won't consider Wiesler to be a bad guy. He gets attached to this couple and forms a well-respected image of them. The point here was about right and wrong and he chooses the right one by helping the couple without being noticed. He was more of a loner.He does good, even sacrifices his own life/job by saving George. Sudden calamities were faced by them. In the end, George came to know that Wiesler helped him someway somehow, so he decides to thank him by writing a novel truly dedicated to him.

He's not smoothly handsome like Tom Cruise. He has utility features that can take any part that requires a sympatico character.<br/><br/>In ""The Lives of Others"" he's a playwright in the 1980s stuck on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall, haunted by the Stasi, the State Security Police, because the possibility exists in the minds of authorities that he and any other artists must secretly harbor dissident thoughts, and we can't have that.<br/><br/>So the Stasi plant bugs all over his apartment and install a monitor in the cellar, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, who signs his reports ""HGW"".<br/><br/>The authorities are right, in a way. Koch and his live-in girl friend and star actress in his plays, do have a lot of politically active visitors. Pretty soon, Wiesler, that joyless cellar rat, is witness to all kinds of subversive conversational exchanges in addition to frequent ""vigorous intimate events."" But a strange thing happens. Wiesler, an almost stereotypical bad guy who never smiles or cracks a joke, begins to change as a consequence of looking into the unrestrained life of artists and intellectuals. It's like the Heisenberg principle in reverse. Observing the object results in a change in the observer. And Wiesler starts altering his reports, leaving out any suspicious conversations, listening raptly to Koch's piano playing a moody and elegant piece written by a friend and titled ""Sonata for a Good Man.""<br/><br/>There isn't space to outline the entire plot, which is deliberately paced and clearly not intended for kids munching popcorn and getting high on energy drinks. You have to have patience for events to unfold. And unfold they do, with increasing rapidity, until there are some exceedingly tense searches for hidden objects, some self-indulgent squealing on the part of people who shouldn't squeal, and penultimately a cothurnal accident and the death of someone who has been squeezed beyond endurance by the state.<br/><br/>In the denouement, some years after the wall falls, Koch decides to look up his own Stasi file in the archives. There he learns the truth. Every guilty move that he, his lover, and his friends made, was overheard by Wiesler, the pale slug downstairs, who decided to save Koch's Speck. The pages of the report are signed merely ""HGW XXVII."" But Koch is inspired to find out the name and identity of his underground friend and savior, although he doesn't contact him.<br/><br/>In the final scene, Wiesler, now a humble mailman dragging himself through the graffiti-ridden slums, wanders into a book store and locates Koch's new book, ""Sonata for a Good Man: A Novel."" The dedication reads: ""To HGW."" The clerk asks if Wiesler would like the purchase gift wrapped and Wiesler, without expression, replies, ""No. It's for me."" I found that ending both clarifying and emotionally moving. There were no more loose ends.<br/><br/>It's a powerful film. I recommend it but, as I say, it requires some attention, especially for the first third, which moves along slowly. The last half picks up. If you make it that far, you probably won't want to leave it without seeing the end."

","After watching the movie last night, I just couldn't fathom the reason why this movie is so venerated and awarded. At best its a passable account of life in the GDR serviced by a fairly decent script ruined by insipid and lifeless direction. Oh actually the script is also nothing home to write about.<br/><br/>First the movie has absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever and each frame looks like it could be anywhere in Europe in the 50s, 60s or 2000s. Is the Stasi something to be feared? Yes we know that already but the movie never attempts to make you feel scared, or feel claustrophobic or paranoid of the environment in which everything you see or do is under the watch of some Big Brother. A key plot point of the movie brings in a comparison with Hungary. I happened to visit the the Hungarian equivalent of the Hohenschönhausen in Budapest and it made me quake in my boots when I saw the prisons there. The movie steers clear of any 'fearful' portrayal of the Stasi.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting, Sebastian Koch as Dreyman maintains a one-note expression throughout the movie. You could never tell from his crinkly half grinning half squinting expression whether he's tense or happy or scared or what. As a result you never come to care about the predicaments of the central character. There are a couple of good performances by Ulrich Mühe as Weisler and Thomas Thieme as Minister Hempf but thats all there is to it.<br/><br/>I couldn't really point out whether there was something wrong with the Script or the Direction in the end but ultimately it looks like it's a bit of both. A central character has a change of heart which is abrupt and I could never really point out why it occurred, considering how the initial introduction of the character was laid out. The last 10 minutes of the movie borders on the ridiculous when it spends undue amount of time to 'explain' everything that happened (or maybe Dreyman WAS stupid). <br/><br/>All in all the movie was decent but nothing to be wowed over. When I learned that the Director of the movie also directed 'The Tourist' I was not in the least bit surprised."

","I don't have many things to mention about this film, since I really enjoyed it and it lacks of flaws.<br/><br/>I really appreciated the fact that the director had valid knowledge over the events with Stasi, and yet he presented a great, realistic story that had a connection with the main theme.<br/><br/>At first, he presents inhumanity along with the violation of privacy. Many people, back then, took part to this type of actions and felt no guilt. On the other hand, we can see the humanity and the need for help, because the criminals were Stasi people and not the innocent people, who were trying to make Germany a better place to live in.<br/><br/>Ulrich Mühe, was a proven great actor, and did a good job here. His character's actions really touched me. You could see the change from the beginning of the film, until the last scene. From a ruthless person, he became more sensitive, and started to care about Sebastian Koch's character, who was a very kind man, along with his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Sebastian Koch's character was my favourite though. I really liked the fact that he was fighting for a better living. Even his attitude towards his girlfriend was non-humanly good. I loved his revolutionary spirit!<br/><br/>Martina Gedeck's character had me feel very depressed. Not in a bad way. I mean that I could definitely feel her emotions and all of her sadness. And had me in tears the tragic misunderstanding. Another example of a great actress!<br/><br/>I really want to mention that all of the actors who took part in the film were great and very convincing. I think that they made a great casting.<br/><br/>The last scene literally had me in tears. It was one of the best endings in the film history. I wish many Films could be like this one. It contains a powerful story, which based on true events and contains a very beautiful soundtrack as well.<br/><br/>The reason I don't rate it 10/10, is because I would have wanted it to have a little smaller duration.

"antoniokowatsch","10","1","2","19 May 2018"," A movie about redemption
","The movie is set in East Berlin in the year 1984. Back when Germany was a totalitarian state. The Stasi was in charge of spying on its citizens and that's exactly where the movie starts. The protagonist, Mr. Wiesler, is a seasoned Stasi agent who has had an illustrious career. So much so that he's even instructing upcoming agents in the practices of interrogation techniques. Another important task that Stasi agents were known for; their ""interrogation"" methods.
Early on in the movie the protagonist gets assigned to a special ""public figure"". He himself wanted to get the assignment but as we later find out there were ulterior motives at play. Motives that concern his superiors.<br/><br/>Mr. Wiesler takes great pride in his job because he's really good at it.
But as the movie progresses he has to reconcile with the fact that his current assignment is morally unjustified. Even though the protagonist is clearly meant to be the ""bad guy"" we are constantly witnessing the moments when his humanity shines through; to the point where we're able to empathize with him. He's a flawed character just like everybody else. Which makes the movie so believable.<br/><br/>Dreyman on the other hand is a good person but too many bad things keep happening to him. All of these bad turns of events eventually force him to step out of his ""zone of complacency"", to make a hard decision. With unforeseen consequences.<br/><br/>This movie is so powerful. It evokes so many emotions that it literally covers the entire emotional spectrum: anger, contempt, suspicion, deceit, humor, compassion, sadness, grief,...<br/><br/>It's ultimately a really sad movie though, with a lot of character development. The protagonist keeps indulging in the lives of the people who he's supposed to spy on. And by doing so he becomes a better person.<br/><br/>The ending was extremely satisfying to watch. Arguably one of the best movies I've ever seen. Everything came full circle, so poetically. I was not prepared for this. This is exactly what good filmmaking is all about. It's the full package.
Even the setting is flawless; watching the movie feels like travelling back in time. That's how immersive it was.<br/><br/>Final verdict: supremely recommended (you're not going to regret it)"

"madisonmertz","Null","1","2","26 October 2016"," Follow Up Questions and Main Theme
","""The Lives of Others"" left a strong impression on me about Germany during the time the wall was up and the Stasi controlled the lives of others. Although the movie had many complexities and themes, I will only touch on a few of the questions I had from the film and the main theme. <br/><br/>There were a few things in the movie that did not make sense to me. Why did Wiesler remove the evidence from under the floor board at the end of the movie? This would have saved Dreymann but it would have ended Christa Maria. It seems like she would be imprisoned for lying. Why would Wiesler want Christa imprisoned? Did he like Dreymann better? My next question is why the mission ended after Christa committed suicide? Was this because the Stasi now felt bad for Dreymann or because they honestly thought he was innocent after not finding evidence under the floorboard?<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" had several main themes. I think the most important theme was what it means to be a good person. After watching this movie I can not help but look at people in my own life and think ""that is a good man."" I felt sorry for Wiesler, because he had no love. I saw the most character growth with him and by the end of the movie I think most people can agree that he is a good man. Dreymann seems to be a good man throughout the film and he grows as a character when he takes a stand against the Stasi. Christa Maria in my opinion, is a good person, she just has some personal insecurities. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a well put together movie with many more elements and complexities and themes."
"nesfilmreviews","10","1","2","17 October 2013"," A masterpiece.
","Similar to the communist witch hunts that alarmed American's in the 1950's, ""The Lives Of Others"" offers a riveting view of life behind the Berlin Wall. Director von Donnersmarck engages us in the life of a cold, dispassionate character then takes us on a journey that transforms him from detached observer to involved partisan. The film is careful to avoid overt melodrama, but at the same time, it engages the emotions. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the movie is the complexity and intelligence evident in the screenplay. The unique angle of the film is in itself unusual, a thriller that follows the villains. <br/><br/>It's 1984 in East Berlin, and Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a secret agent of the Stasi who investigate civilians suspected of undermining government authority. That's why when Stasi Capt. Wiesler first sets eyes on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), he doesn't like him. Dreyman, by all accounts, is a loyal socialist, but the captain sees the playwright -- handsome and self-possessed, at home with himself as he watches his latest play -- and pronounces him ""arrogant."" Dreyman is a happy man -- an artist in love with his work and with another artist, a great actress (Martina Gedeck) -- and that in itself makes him an enemy of the state. Though von Donnersmarck accords Dreyman and Crista a fair amount of screen time, their roles are simply to act as catalysts. This is Wiesler's story, and although there are moments of tragedy, it's ultimately one of redemption. <br/><br/>Wiesler is a fascinating character, a blank slate if you will, trained to reflect no emotion whatsoever. As played in Muehe's performance of infinite subtlety, he watches Dreyman as a cat awaits a mouse. He begins to internalize their lives, because he has no life of his own; no lover, no hobbies, no distraction from his single-minded job. Wiesler has no one he can really talk to. His gradual transition from loyal soldier of the state, to a man embracing emotions for the first time is the film's most compelling aspect throughout. The seduction depicted in ""The Lives of Others"" is inadvertent, and it's the allure of the beauty found in art, the exploration of the meaning of life, and the possibility of love, all of which are absent from Wiesler's existence. By listening to Dreyman and Crista, he discovers the potential of a more fulfilling existence. Eventually, his desires leads him to protect the couple, even though his actions violate the law, and places his career in jeopardy. <br/><br/>The strength of ""The Lives of Others"" is that it works on numerous levels - especially in the way it approaches Wiesler's complexity as an individual, and that none of the characters are one-dimensional. An arresting drama from first time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, accompanied by phenomenal performances and a terrific screenplay. Oscar winner as Best Foreign Language Film."

"armanmarok","10","1","2","6 April 2012"," By Listening to The Lives of Others, One Man Rediscovered His Own
","I know little about Germany, GDR, and their history altogether. And to be frank, all I ever cared from Germany is their movies, the good ones of course. I'm a huge fan of Brazil since I was young, so I never cared about Germany's national football team. But their movies are a different story.<br/><br/>I encountered this movie by chance, when I found out Pan's Labyrinth didn't win the Oscar For Best Foreign Language. Now, the Oscar made a mistake countless times in almost every major categories. For one, I'm still baffled to this day that Amélie received major snubbing in many categories from the Academy. So when I found out there was a German movie called Das Leben der Anderen that beat Pan's Labyrinth, I was determined to see the movie for myself. And boy, was it worth it! Among many movies not made in the English language that received the Best Foreign Language Oscar on the last decade (2000-2009), this must be the most deserving.<br/><br/>Set only 4 years before The Fall of Berlin Wall, this movie is far from your standard political thriller filled with boring conversations and endless conspiracies. No, there is no action scene at all in this movie, but the tension was there, the story was existent, the protagonists were 'human', and even the antagonists were realistic. It was more like a human drama to me. It is not about how this guy solves mission A or this guy solves mission B, no. It's more about how a hardened soldier rediscover where his heart was by listening to how others share theirs.<br/><br/>Gerd Wiesler was an experienced Captain and interrogator Stasi, GDR's Secret Police, with 20 years worth of service. A very hardened veteran inside & outside, he is the guy you don't wanna mess with. No one could topple him in the interrogation table. He knew how the break his targets, what their weaknesses were, and what would push their buttons. He knew human psychology like the palm of his hand. But in his personal life, he was no more than a loner. No wife, no kids, no friends, no human contact at all. All he ever did in his apartment was eating some meals, watching random TV shows, and inviting prostitute to take care of his sexual needs.<br/><br/>But his life changed forever when he was assigned a mission to spy on a playwright and his girlfriend, a stage actress, whom his higher ups believe to secretly stand against the socialism beliefs the government of GDR upheld. At first, it seemed like it was just going to be another mission for him. Another one of those jobs that was going to end soon not long after it began. But day by day, week after week, as Wiesler heard & watched how they live, how they share their love, and how they handle their distress, he felt like he was a part of their community. After 20 years of loneliness, there was a sense of wanting to be need, wanting to have something more than just missions. He began to feel like he was one of them. That sympathy reached its peak when he found out his current targets were actually innocent and he was assigned to this mission only so his superiors could receive personal achievement, something he greatly disliked because he believed the party he served for as long as he could remember were driven by heartless & egoistical people. Only then, he started to rediscover his heart, which he neglected long ago. Little by little, he became human again. And all this leads to a poignant conclusion.<br/><br/>The late Ulrich Mühe gave what may very well be the greatest performance in his career as Gerd Weisler in the best movie he has ever been in. He said more in his silence than in his words. His eyes alone spoke what he felt inside his heart. His actions were louder than his words. None of his actions felt forced, each and every one of it was genuine. He really showed the transformation of his character to become human. The rest of the casts did an outstanding job as well, especially Sebastian Koch who played the writer. He was successful on making his character likable, but without making it look weak.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very powerful & human drama. I agree this is one of the best movies of the last decade. And to me personally, this is so far the best German movie I have ever seen in my life. 10/10. Eternally recommended!"

"chaos-rampant","Null","1","2","19 November 2010"," Malevolent presence
","I had no idea the world of The Lives of Others would fascinate me so much. I don't give much cred to Oscar winners, foreign or otherwise. Yet I was lucky to grow up in a country that just barely escaped the iron grip of communism but at the same time one that existed just outside of that reach, every now and then the Iron Curtain would be lifted and something would filter through, groping violently in a society that is still deeply class divided to this day. I didn't live through the Dictatorship of the Proletariat but I remember Zastavas and Ladas and old beatup Yugos in the streets and Gorbachev in the news, and a few days ago, on the 17th of November, we celebrated the fall of the military junta of '68, a totalitarian regime that existed on the backs of its own type of Stasi and oppression of human rights. This is still fresh and emblematic in our national memory, so this film hits home in ways someone born in America is lucky never to have to deal with even in retrospect.<br/><br/>If I like this so much it's because it's something at once familiar and otherworldly, mysterious and horrifying because some of the features are known to me but not the whole, because it takes place in cold empty streets and gray apartment rises all identical to one another that remind me of cold Berlin neighborhoods I visited, characters groping for identity and expression in surroundings that deny them. It's all very crushing because ideology is not the end but the means by which selfish men can pursue selfish goals, because a figurative heaven where things for Georg and Marie would be fine exists in the very same city, just outside a dividing wall, across the street. Streets are empty because something keeps people from venturing out, and I like how that urban desert of fear and suspicion is shown to seep inside living-rooms, behind closed doors a malevolent presence groping blindly and unseen there.<br/><br/>The only thing amiss here for me is that The Lives of Others tries to exist in a state of matter-of-factly observation. I would love to see a Zulawski version, character emotions swirling in violent storms, or one made by a New Wave minimalist, where faces are mute and the silence deafening. Von Donnermarck's movie is a little too concerned with going with the flow of established filmmaking, of what is immediately expected and accepted by this type of film. I wanted to see it make breaches with the audience, to be difficult and not give us all that we want. The storytelling is perfect but at the expense of that poetic extension where things are allowed to linger in the mind and be metaphors, enigmas, mysteries haunting and supine.<br/><br/>The marvelous thing about it is that it has amazing characters. I like how they not only rise to moral standards in affirmation of the human spirit but also fall from them with the same affirmation. Marie's final betrayal is crushing, she sells both soul and body, and it's tragic because she's damned even before she's allowed that choice. I like how the film doesn't end with the cathartic note, with the bang. We're given the echo, the aftermath. The regime has fallen but the former minister still attends the theater, still wearing an expensive suit. That malevolent presence has seeped out, it always does to fight another day. Former DDR politicians now have lucrative careers as advisers like former KGB officials in Russia are now political barons. But the failings of a political system that cheated people on the base of ideology are shown in chilling detail, and more, the lives behind all that, with their small triumphs and follies, crushed by that system but with that small beacon of humanity, pride or dignity, still intact."
"Jona1988","8","1","2","14 October 2010"," Gripping!! Great both for the realism and story
","This film is just brilliant. It gives an instructive and frightening representation of life in the former eastern bloc. If you are interested in history and especially the cold war you will find The Lives of Others is fantastic. Very providing of fact about how things were in those times. It really captures the tone and gives an amazingly realistic descriptions of the totalitarian rule of East Germany. They want to show you how it worked back there, this film is definitely not any anticommunist propaganda. So well done it feels like it really was made back then. But the film doesn't just succeed in the presentation of the atmosphere and factual representation. It also provides a great story with gripping characters. The acting is absolutely brilliant, Ulrich Mühe is amazing in the lead. The story is one which really builds up the longer it goes. Not meaning that it starts slow absolutely not, it starts out great and just keeps getting better and better. The story keeps going up never tripping over, makes it brilliantly all the way to the end. A rare story that manages to hold up all the way. The plot is so good and well executed. You are never sure where it's heading and you always sit on the edge longing to find out what will happen next. The films tone and pace is very sad, cheerless and slow moving. This works nothing less than perfect. Still it happens things of importance almost all the time so it is a film which requires you to pay attention to keep up with what is happening. However it won't be a problem to maintain concentration at a film so fantastic as this one. The Lives of Others is just as much entertainment as an experience. What they show you really makes one think. Might call it somewhat of an eye opener if you are not well into the subject. Thought-provoking and relevant even today. Something you really ought to see. Brilliant 8/10"

","¨The state office for statistics on Hans-Beimler street counts everything; knows everything: how many pairs of shoes I buy a year: 2.3, how many books I read a year: 3.2 and how many students graduate with perfect marks: 6,347. But there's one statistic that isn't collected there, perhaps because such numbers cause even paper-pushers pain: and that is the suicide rate.¨ German director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, directed and wrote one of the best German films I've seen to date: Das Leben Der Anderen (The Lives of Others). This is just a remarkable movie which will stay with you for a long time. The director grabs your attention from the very opening scene and shocks you with this excellent thriller. After watching this, it comes as no surprise that this movie won the Oscar in 2007 for best foreign picture because it is really well made, the script is gripping, and the performances are great. There is nothing negative to say about this movie because it is just one of those films that sticks with you and shows you the dangers of a socialist government when freedom of expression is dismissed. After seeing this political thriller, you will never feel the same way about freedom and privacy. This is not one of those boring political movies, it actually has a great script and the story unfolds at a good pace. The movie actually ranks at 55 in the top 250 movies of all time according to IMDb so it is amongst good company. This is one film you will not want to miss and it exposes everything that is wrong with an authoritarian government.<br/><br/>The story takes place in East Germany in 1984 when the Berlin Wall still divided the country. Hauptmann Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) worked as a spy for East Germany's secret police. The socialist government was banning several artists who were right winged, and Wiesler was handed the task of spying a play writer named Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) who lived with his actress-girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Georg is one of the few writers who hasn't been banned yet, although he has received some threats from Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), so he knows he has to be very careful with how he expresses himself in his writing. The Minister also seems to have an eye for Christa and will do what he can to be with her. Georg hangs around a lot with one of his friends who happens to be a right winged director named Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert). Albert is very unhappy with the government controls and is always protesting. One day he commits suicide and this opens Georg's eyes on how the authoritarian regime is killing individual freedoms. The suicide rate is growing at an alarming rate and Georg wants to write about it although he fears the government. Wiesler is convinced that he is doing the best for his socialist country and works proudly for his government. He is a very lonely man and is dedicated fully to his job, but as he spies on Georg and his relationship with Christa he becomes more and more involved with their life and discovers some revealing information. The plot begins to thicken from this point and the movie completely hooks your attention.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others is probably one of the best political thrillers I've seen in a long time and it is the best German film I have seen to date. The script was nicely written, the performances were great; Ulrich Muhe, Sebastian Koch, and Martina Gedeck all gave terrific performances, and the soundtrack was also great. There is one scene where Georg is playing a sonata in the piano while Wiesler is listening and you can see how his face actually lights up when he hears the music. I think that the audience had a similar response to that of Wiesler, or at least I did because it was just a terrific scene. If you haven't seen this movie then don't waste any more time and go see it because it is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time. It is one of those few movies that are more than entertaining and actually leave you more enlightened. A very well made movie, definitely worth checking out! http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","With The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen), debuting director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafts a simultaneously gripping and intelligent political drama about an agent for East Germany's secret police. Just as a Stasi agent finds himself irrevocably drawn into the lives of the couple he's spying on, so does Donnersmarck compel his viewers into an oh-so meticulously crafted piece set in pre-unified Germany, five years before the Berlin Wall's crumbling. Capt. Wiesler, played by the late Ulrich Mühe with an eerie adeptness, is assigned to conduct a covert surveillance on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Wiesler initially carries out his task with such calculated efficiency, but gradually finds himself pulled into an emotional web that slowly peels away his impassive facade. In the same way, Donnersmarck lets The Lives of Others unfold into a beautifully structured story that's powerfully told and populated with richly defined characters. It's at once a chilling reminiscence of a recent part in German history and a touching portrait of the human social network."
"imagiking","7","1","2","5 July 2010"," Das Leben der Anderen: Subtle But Touching
","A movie I'd long been intending to watch, Das Leben der Anderen has many accolades to its name, not least of all its Oscar. Add to this the generally intarnishable excellence of modern German cinema, and you have a sure recipe for entertainment.<br/><br/>An exploration of Cold War Germany, Das Leben der Anderen is the story of GDR espionage officer Gerd Wiesler in his duties spying upon playwright and actress couple Georg and Christa-Maria. Initially a faithful servant of the East, Wiesler is slowly romaniticised by the ideals subtly instilled within his subconscience by those he surveills.<br/><br/>As one might expect from a film set during this era, Das Leben der Anderen is heavily political. We see this immediately expressed through several characters, primarily Wiesler. Cold, austere, and unemotional, he shows us the filmmakers' view of East Germany and its agents, conveying to us the sinister notoriety of this infamous entity. It takes perhaps half an hour of the film's running time before we observe a trace of humanity within the character: a veritable needle in a haystack of socialist stoicism. The gentle unravelling of his personal life is wonderful, giving us a detailed picture by showing a blank canvas. As Wiesler's vacuous life of monotony and iciness rolls on, the shared life of his assigned targets seems ever more appealing, the romance between them something entirely foreign and unknown to him. This juxtaposition, purveyed through colour schemes of respective apartments as well as the actors themselves, is for me more appealing than the film's significant political commentary. The extent of the effect of Georg upon Wiesler, despite the fact that they never actually meet, is fantastically enthralling, slowly coming to show us the human side of the previously authoritarian figure. Undoubtedly, the praise for this belongs to Mühe, his performance calm, collected, and capturing. As well as the gripping characterisation, the film's plot is involving; a well paced drama that effectively shows us life behind the wall. The film is rife with subtle but touching moments, beautiful in their simplicity and impact. Not least of these is the closing line, its delivery absolutely perfect and hard-hitting. Tonally, the film is consistent and insistent, evidencing the eagerness of von Donnersmarck to tell this important story.<br/><br/>Accurately portraying the concomitant fear, uncertainty, and disillusion of the GDR's command, Das Leben der Anderen propels us effortlessly into the world of its characters. Slowly and comprehensively crafting a complete picture of its main character, one which gradually affixes itself forever to our affections, this is a very fine film indeed."
"paul2001sw-1","8","1","2","6 March 2010"," A strange kind of comradeship
","Perhaps the most sinister feature of the communist states of eastern Europe was the way they made a reality of George Orwell's thought police, with networks of informers so extensive that no-one could ever trust their ""comrade"", a hollow term indeed when you are considered an enemy of the state if you would not betray your friend to it. There are obvious parallels in McCarthyism; but the difference is one of scale. 'The Lives of Others' tells an entertaining, and ultimately moving, story set in East Germany's secret police. What I liked about the film is that it accepts the notion that everyone is compromised (and compromising) in some way in any society; compromise is what we do to survive. Again, the difference is in the degree, and this can change over time. What is less strong is the characterisation; it's not awful, and the lead protagonists do what is necessary to drive the plot, but I've seen deeper movies. Also, there is a lengthy epilogue after the film's emotional climax which seems to exist primarily to provide (unnecessary) feel-good vibes for the audience (structurally, there's a similarity to the ending of 'The Shawshank Redemption' in the way that this works). It's still a good film, both thought-provoking and enjoyable to watch; if the idea of collaboration interests you further, I recommend Kieslowski's early movies, particularly 'No End'."
"juliensaroyan-1","10","1","2","28 April 2009"," Magnificent performance by Ulrich Mühe!
","All cinematographic ensemble involved in creating ""Das Leben der Anderen"" proved to be magnificent. Nonetheless, I would like to focus on Ulrich Mühe, who,in my opinion, has done a marvellous, heartbreaking job playing Stasi captain Gerd Wiesler who is fanatically obsessed with interrogation, surveillance and etc. in the beginning of the movie. However, in the course of it, somewhat awkward, dramatically lonesome and laconic officer with inexplicable penchant for revealing dissidents had metamorphosed into a truly sympathetic person. Perhaps, he was sympathetic all the time in his own intrinsic, implicit way? Perhaps, he is simply looking for the right opportunity to grasp and help someone really deserving help? Perhaps, his acquaintance with Bertolt Brecht or ""sonate vom gutten menschen"" assisted in awakening momentary lapse of sympathy his inner tender-hearted microcosm? My dear reader, you yourself had better answer these questions after spending one hundred thirty seven unforgettable minutes watching this movie. Respectfully yours,"
"mausar","10","1","2","4 April 2009"," Inside Totalitarianism
","This is totalitarianism. Finally a German young director understood and exposed the machinery of tyranny. This work resulted in the masterpiece of 2006: ""The Lives of the Others"". While the totalitarian system of DDR (the former Communist regime of East Germany) is the main character in the first half of the film, human characters emerge during the story. This is precisely the meaning of all this work: the individual rebellion of common people against an oppressive and collective society. This rebellion is embodied by a secret agent of political police (Stasi), one of the most loyal and respected social role in the former regime. His task: seek the enemies of the State. And destroy the personal enemies of ""Vips"" (oligarchs and ministers) in the ruling élite. To discover the ""enemies"", he has to enter their lives: no problem for a loyal agent. The problem begins when he discovers the humanity and the dept of his ""enemies"", when he has to spy the lives of two renowned artists: a theater comedian and his lover, a famous actress. And then he has to face a major change in his own life. But here stops the review, because I don't wanna make spoilers. Against all the ""ostalgia"" (nostalgia of DDR), this movie explain with clear and plain language that: there is no possible compromise between a totalitarian regime and a human life. ""If Lenin did listen the Beethoven's Sonata for a Good Man he couldn't make the revolution"" tells the main character in one crucial dialog. The regime imposed by Lenin's heirs encouraged all the worst traits of human character: fear, envy, lust for power, forced prostitution (intellectual and physical prostitution). In that context, the individual resistance was the only possible way to pursue the virtues of man."

","I went into this one with high hopes, and the 2007 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film does not disappoint. Normally, the winners in the Best Foreign Film category do not excite me as much as this one did, but the fact that it beat out El Laberinto del Fauno (or, Pan's Labyrinth), which I would place in my top twenty-five films of all time, that particular year, I figured this German piece had to be good. The acting all-around is phenomenal, from Thieme's small role as the person you could consider the villain to Mühe, the agent who completely changes his own livelihood as a result of listening in on this writer and his life. Now, I don't want to say too much for fear of giving away the whole point of the story, but it really is a beautiful piece and the screenplay is fantastic. I empathized so much with certain characters that it would have been impossible to tear me away from the screen. What really makes this film, however, is the absence of any real resolution until the final scene. It keeps the viewer with a wide range of jumbled emotions concerning the events that have taken place, but the very last scene of the film makes it all worth it. It even brought a tear to my eye. Truly a beautiful film that's definitely worth a watch."

I was fortunate to have lived in the reunited Germany in the 1990's and to see Eastern Berlin again. Memory was fresh enough to fill me with a very different kind of wonderment.

"RResende","Null","1","2","15 October 2008"," reasons to be Human
","One of the living thinking minds i most admire is George Steiner. He is a man of great intelligence in the way he knows why knowledge is meaningful, and why it is important to Know. Among the many issues that have been a constant concern in his thinking life, one has been with me all the way since Steiner showed it to me: the brutal contradiction between human actions, or how he would put it; how can someone cry over night deeply moved by a Schubert Sonata, and in the next morning coldly order the killing of thousands of people.<br/><br/>This fundamental issue was vivid in my mind all the way, throughout this happily depressing film. There even is a direct reference to this question in it. So the theme here is how the meanings of art, or the simple reference to it can influence a mind trained to not be influenced and mechanically not behave humanly. Minds trained to trust what they're taught.<br/><br/>The way this is put together is with one of the most subtle cinematic constructions i have (ever?) seen. The focus is on the artists, repressed artists, subjugated by a repressive regime. In the world framed in this film everything moves around them. Those artists are watched, constantly. We watch them, and in that watching we have the company of someone whose job is literally to watch. He starts with cold inhumanity (the first scene establishes that), obsessive watching, which that regime would probably consider simply 'professional'.<br/><br/>In the way he gets involved with the subject of his watching (artistically modeled lives). Several things underline this: Art bends his mind to the point in which he plays double and starts writing an invented story to protect the real story the play writer is writing; He steals a book from the subject he's watching, and secretly reads it at home; he asks a prostitute to stay with him longer than the deal would require, basically to be more than sex. Ultimately, he rewrites the ending of the whole story by hiding a forbidden object (a typewriter!) and thus secretly entering and changing the life of the artist.<br/><br/>This is a perfect expression of the dangerous of true commitment to true art, the art which embraces ideas that matter.<br/><br/>The camera is subtle, it moves most of the time, its movement doesn't call attention, but always add up to the tension, mostly with subtle travelings. And watch the use of space. See how the interior of the apartment is used, how the cinematography carefully captures all the nuances and how they enlarge and diminish the inner space, in accordance with what the characters feel. Than notice how the humanity of that coloured environment is contrasted with the attic where the watcher stands, and even how he abstractly recreates the space below, from the sound of it. <br/><br/>Ulrich Mühe really had a deeply moving and intelligent performance. Very sad that he left us so early, here he really is something to look at, and performs fully in the field that most impresses me: that of subtlety, that kind of acting of great expression out of imperceptible moves. Most of it is in his face, so many times carefully framed.<br/><br/>The aftermath of the thing is when the artist writes a book, supposedly about the story we just saw. As if the film we had just seen was in fact made from the book. I was lucky to watch such a film. what a privilege.<br/><br/>Most of the times, i appreciate a film for its qualities as a vehicle for new/interesting ways to pass a story, or for how its visual quality/presentations gives me themes to dream about. This one works on the both previous aspects, but does it in a theme that matters. That's so rare.<br/><br/>My opinion: 5/5, watch it if you want to feel more human.<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

"Trickya","9","1","2","7 August 2008"," A touching movie that shows the GDR's ruthlessness
","The Lives of Others is a powerful film which tells the memorable story of characters living in East Berlin during the oppressive regime of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The journey begins in 1984 when the GDR maintained a tight grip on its citizen in Berlin, and ultimately the film finishes in 1991 after the Soviet Union collapses. Critically acclaimed director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck creates a story so dramatic viewers are literally glued to the screen. Not only does Donnersmack create a masterpiece through the dramatic conflicts of his character but he also paints an eye opening portrayal of the cruelty and intrusiveness the GDR inflicted on its citizens. The Lives of Others revolves around the disillusionment of Stasi Captian Gerd Wiesler, a committed and strict socialist, who as the story progresses becomes more and more confused about his ideology. Wiesler's personal beliefs begin to unravel when he accepts the mission of spying on Berlin playwright Georg Dreyman who is believed to have pro-western sympathies. Dreyman lives with his beautiful girlfriend, the successful German actress Christa-Maria Sieland. As Wiesler begins to observe the daily interactions of the loving couple, he starts to lose sight of his mission and becomes emotionally attached. His admiration for Dreyman and Christa-Maria is catalyzed even further as Wiesler discovers that the motivation for spying on Dreyman has not as much to do with any legitimate suspicion of treachery but rather the personal desires of a high level central committee member in the GDR. It is soon revealed that a vile and corrupt official named Hampf contains a lustful desire for Christa-Maria and the only way he believes he can have her is to get rid of Dreyman. Inspired by the power of their romance, Wiesler ultimately risks everything to protect the couple. He lies to his Stasi coworkers and intervenes in their affairs to ensure that they will never find any evidence with which they could charge Dreyman. Dreyman and Christa-Maria are totally unaware all the while that for months they have secretly been receiving help from Wiesler, their watchful guardian. After intense escalation, the hopes and happiness of Dreyman and Christa-Maria, come crashing down on them as Wiesler's deception catches up to him and he is no longer able to protect the couple. The Lives of Others is a powerful movie that encapsulates philosophical, cultural, and political debate. The film uses the emotional transformation of Wiesler and the dramatic collapse of Dreyman and Christa-Maria's love as vehicles to reveal the oppressive and inhumane nature of the GDR. The film is also a great tool for any interested in German and Russian history, specifically the Cold War era. It perfectly captures the lack of privacy citizens had from their government during this time in Germany, and also how little artistic freedom was allowed. The movie is shrouded in an undertone of constant suspicion, and even as a viewer I couldn't help but look over my shoulder every now and then to be sure I wasn't being watched by a Stasi agent. I would recommend this movie to anyone not only as a great dramatic achievement but also as a historical reference providing insight into daily dealings of the Communist ruled East Berlin."
"super_dale","8","1","2","30 July 2008"," a quiet triumph
","The Lives of Others is a quietly mesmerising film that makes you think. Don't expect fireworks or high drama- just a thoughtful exploration of the human spirit.<br/><br/>I won't dwell long on the plot- in East Germany in 1985, a Stasi agent (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned to undertake surveillance on a popular playwright (Sebastian Koch)- purely because an important official wishes to steal his girlfriend, a leading actress (Martina Gedech). As the state security machinery swings into action, each of the main characters makes decisions which have devastating effects.<br/><br/>The drabness of 1980s GDR is wonderfully created and sustained, and there are two exceptional central performances from Muhe and Koch. Muhe expresses so much doing very little as the loyal Stasi agent who comes to realise that as his bosses care less for the state than their careers and love lives, the artist he is spying on is willing to sacrifice all for his beliefs.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect- Martina Gedech overacts in the female role, and I found her role in the denouement unsatisfactory. In fact, women fare particularly badly in the film altogether. And like anything created by 'artists', the film lingers a little too long on the 'woe is me' difficulty of being an 'artist'. However, I found The Lives Of Others an excellent movie with, for me, a satisfying conclusion."

","It is little wonder that this bleak tale of a government attempting to control everything begins in the magical year of 1984, a certain sequence of numbers which can not possibly be thought of without connotations of George Orwell's powerfully oppressive novel of totalitarian government monopolies  unlike you're a complete philistine who has been living under a rock since 1948  and it's from this setting of mood that we can judge the rest of this amazing piece of cinema from. The first scenes see a prisoner of the state being interrogated for an entire day - no rest, no food, no drink, even no toilet, just questions  and it being spliced together, via cassette recordings of the questioning, with students attending a lecture on how to spot, arrest and bring out a confession from a person suspected of anti-Socialist behaviour. And who is their lecturer? Why no other than the interrogative bastard we've just seen verbally beat a man into submission. So, before we've even met our protagonist yet, and having been introduced to an agent so devout of his cause, we can't help but feel sorry for the man whom is going to come under twenty-four hour surveillance in an attempt to take him from the theatre world where his political plays are causing a fuss amongst the big wigs.<br/><br/>But that is not to say that this marvellous piece of cinema is completely without more humane elements. It is, after all, a study of these men and their incredibly differing characters. Of the man whose job it is to spy on the country's citizens and the man who writes plays with political undertones. And how their lives become so entwined (unbeknownst to the latter as he lives on in blissful ignorance of his surveillance) that his watcher starts to actually feel something. This character he watches and listens to provides him with so much depth, dimension and life he soon realises that this man has everything that his own life has been drained of in the years of his blind obedience to the state. And the question starts to bug him, then burn, before he finally goes about answering it: does he continue his duty to the state, his bosses and his job and just wait for enough evidence to arrest the man and throw him behind bars indefinitely to be subject to the endless questioning we've seen him capable of already? Or does he reassess his morals due to the humanity in this man that he misses  and almost seems to crave  and change daily reports from the surveillance tapes, microphones and cameras which will send the rest of his team off the trail, so there is not enough evidence to arrest him and so his quiet, intrigued voyeurism can continue? This film is cinema as its best for character depth, emotion and identification. A truly powerful piece of film, with an ending which pulls at the heartstrings at even the most toughened of cine-geeks.

Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is one of the Stasi's best soldiers and is told to spy on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend. But as he spots their beautiful freedom and love, his own heart becomes melted and he becomes softened against the harsh regeime he serves. But when a close friend of Georg's commits suicide, he writes a subversive article on why the government has been listing suicides as 'self murders' for many years which manages to get published. Wiesler then becomes torn between his duties to his government and his newfound love for this pair.<br/><br/>Foreign films, or 'arthouse' films, of course have never received the same kind of publicity and promotion as your average brainless, popcorn munching Hollywood blockbuster. So it was that my first introduction to the existence of The Lives of Others was a glowing review in the DVD section of Empire Magazine (Empire Magazine have said it's brilliant...it must be great!) With all the praise heaped on it, and all the five stars handed out by various other critics/magazines, it's a wonder the film never got it's own billboard in Times Squaire! Well, now I've managed to seek it out and see it for myself, and while it's not a film that's changed my life in any way, I can still say it's an excellent film that deserves to be seen and which you may well want to see again.<br/><br/>The film lifts the lid on just how intrusive, controlling and oppressive the East German government was in the early 80s, showing a mentality that hadn't changed much since the days of the Nazis (the stasis just sounding like a fancy new word, really.) But in this environment of oppression and bottled misery, we see a beautiful light shine in the shape of Dreyman's love for his actress girlfriend, which of course the oppressor's want to control right away and which turns into a slow burning tale, that feels a bit boring to start with but if you stick with it and pay attention, soon becomes quite gripping and will have you hooked to the emotionally devastating ending.<br/><br/>The performances are spot on, too. Muhe is excellent as the no nonsense, disciplined loyal soldier, not even cracking a smile when his colleagues around him are, whose impossibly cold heart is finally melted when he sees a life he couldn't even have thought of before and Dreyman shines as the creative artist, who still manages to keep his spirit alive even in a world of control and limits, which pays off horribly in the end.<br/><br/>Florian Hencknel von Donnersmarck has crafted a film that will not be forgotten quickly. *****"

I am sure that it will become a modern classic, and it is certainly one of the strongest films produced this decade.<br/><br/>Muhe is brilliant as a Eadt German Stasi official who becomes emotionally involved with the suspects (a playwright and his actress lover) he is spying on. Muhe has very little dialogue in the film, and much of his acting is done with facial expression, reaction and small movements. He is superb. Sebastian Koch, who also did an excellent job in BLACK BOOK, is marvellous as the playwright, capturing his intelligence, anguish and eventual discovery. All the other cast members also put in great work- as I said earlier, the acting is near perfect.<br/><br/>The final twenty minutes or so are shattering, and Muhe's last look at the camera (the closing shot of the film) is haunting and entirely appropriate."

","To its credit, this film has the academy award for the best foreign film and thats for a very good reason.<br/><br/>""The lives of others"" is a movie with a soul in it. No stunning VFX, uncanny camera angles, exotic locations, big sets or stunts. No! This is straight forward story telling at its best. <br/><br/>Performances by all actors, especially by Ulrich Muhe are very good. The color theme, gives a very cold feel and sets a very apt mood.

The story is set in the socialist East Germany where any kind of support for anti-communist ideas is strictly prohibited. In this set up, a loving couple, a play write(Sebastian Koch) and an aspiring actress(Martina Gedeck) come under surveillance for the writer's radical ideas. They unknowingly continue to live in a wired house. On th other end of the wires is an agent(Ulrich) who alertly listens to every word.

","Wonderful film!! I was not prepared to be that moved by it, more so because the story didn't really interest me at first. Fortunately my husband convinced me to see it! It got me! I don't weep often when I see films... but during this one, I almost wept two times because it is so touching! I hate films with effects to make the audience weep, I hate over-romantic films that try to make you feel something : you see the manipulation too blatantly. It is not the case here! It comes slowly, you don't notice anything... It suddenly becomes YOUR OWN LIFE : your story is unfolding!

","There are too many reviews already praising this film in-depth. I just had to add that having been to Berlin a few years ago and visiting the Checkpoint Charlie museum, seeing the few remaining feet of ""the Wall"" and reading about the history of the city during WWII and after - I was incredibly interested in how citizens of East Germany lived during those times. (I regretted then and now DEEPLY regret not finding time to visit the Stasi archives/ museum!)<br/><br/>That would have been enough for a great film, but the painful reality of our current government taking away our civil rights and warrantless wiretapping it's citizens makes this resonate much more personally.<br/><br/>And I didn't even make the connection to the fact that the film starts in 1984 (surely a nod to Orwell) until I read some other comments.<br/><br/>The film does have a few minor flaws, but it has so much resonance that it becomes a great film.<br/><br/>p.s.

"blackburnj-1","9","1","2","12 February 2008"," An uplifting and important film
","When this film won the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, it had pulled off one of the few shocks of that night, beating the much loved and highly favoured Pan's Labyrinth. Here, in Britain, there was a degree of disbelief, as Guillermo del Toro's fantasy epic was a much loved and much admired film. Within a few months, critics could only agree that the competition was very close, with many concurring with the Academy's decision.<br/><br/>This reaction is entirely deserved because The Lives of Others is a magnificent film. It is touching, intelligent and an impressive debut film. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck can only be praised. His script is tight, intelligent and honest. His direction is inventive. All in all, although the film has a few faults, essentially because it could use some cutting, his work is exceptional.<br/><br/>The film is ostensibly a simple drama and it is taken on by the cast with aplomb and they manage to stress the complexity of the film without making it impenetrable. Every member of the ensemble is outstanding. Sebastian Koch, who plays the playwright Dreyman, is brilliant. He is sympathetic and intelligent and makes his character, who really doesn't come into his own until late on into the film, thoroughly interesting. Then there is Martina Gedeck, as the embattled Christa-Maria, who creates great pathos in a tough part. But the standout is undoubtedly Ulrich Mühe who, as the tragic Stasi man Wiesler, is pitch perfect. He makes his character not only believable but thoroughly interesting. It is heartbreaking that Mühe died shortly after this film became so successful, as he was on the verge of the stardom that he still deserves.<br/><br/>Historically, the film is important. It is poignant as a depiction of unrestricted surveillance. Ulrich Mühe himself was monitored by the Stasi and you can see that this is a highly personal project. It provides a chilling vision of a totalitarian state, whilst remaining a human story.<br/><br/>The film is moving and uplifting, with a series of exceptional performances and a promising debut from its director. It acts not only as a compelling thriller but also as an intelligent examination of a truly unpleasant time that needs to be remembered. As surveillance becomes more of an issue, this film becomes more and more important. But the film will ultimately be remembered as a superior piece of art and a thoroughly wonderful piece of work."
"Superunknovvn","8","1","2","6 January 2008"," One of the best recent German films
","The DDR has become a topic as common for German drama movies as the Vietnam War for Hollywood. After the critically acclaimed ""Good Bye Lenin!"" and ""Sonnenallee"", Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brings us this look at the bugging operations of the STASI.<br/><br/>""Das Leben der Anderen"" is a fairy tale for the most part, which was bugging me at the beginning (no pun intended!). The actions of the movies' ""heroes"" are noble, but would anybody act that way in real life? Hardly. Then I realized that that was probably not the main point of the story. The authentic depiction of reality wasn't the focus of the movie - although everyday life in Eastern Berlin during the mid 80's is depicted very truthfully. Still, the important message is the plea for moral courage. To show that even in times when human rights aren't granted adherence, one single will can still make a difference.<br/><br/>The movie is set up nicely and Sebastian Koch, Ulrich Tukur and the late Ulrich Mühe (who tragically passed away months after the film has been released) hand in fantastic performances. The only weak point is the editing which is a bit irritating at times, but doesn't weigh the movie down too much.<br/><br/>""Das Leben der Anderen"" is an honest attempt at coming to terms with the past, and one of the best recent German movies that rightfully got international attention."

It's one of those movies that I consider perfect for me. No pandering. No preaching. No explosions or shooting. Just a quiet, effective, emotional story about how people are affected both negatively and especially positively by simply observing each other. The quietness of the main characters belies the depth of the sacrifices they were making and the intensity of the feelings that motivated them to take such risks. The evidence of the changes in the characters was subtle but unmistakable. <br/><br/>To me it was a little like looking at the Grand Canyon for the first time. I just watched quietly with profound awe and wept at the satisfying end.<br/><br/>I would compare this with the quiet strength of The Station Agent or Remains of the Day.

"Lejink","9","1","2","11 November 2007"," How the other half lived...
","A marvellous feature, completely drawing the viewer into the gray, grubby world of state surveillance employed in the East German state prior to the collapse of Communism in 1989. The movie portrays the emotional journey of a cold hearted Stasi officer, played brilliantly by the late Ulrich Muhe, ruthlessly efficient in spying and interrogation techniques, who finds that his latest operation, the scrutiny of a suspected rebel playwright and his actress wife, unexpectedly humanises him to the point where he turns against his masters but not before tragedy befalls the couple. The recreation of the soul-less streets of mid 80's East Berlin seems entirely life-like, where every day bland state-sponsored TV attempts to neutralise individual expression of its citizens in a way that George Orwell only imagined some 40 years earlier. The ensemble acting is excellent, especially Muhe in the key role of the worm that turns, his face moving from an emotion-less blank canvas to anguished self-loathing as he transfers allegiance at the film's low-key but marvellously effective climax. All told, you really do feel that this is a slice of life you're watching and not fiction, my only gripe might be the that the writer could perhaps have made his point better by taking as the central subjects a more mundane couple than the slightly rarified examples of a distinguished writer and his famous actress wife. But for a sentiment-free picture of the de-humanising impact of Soviet Bloc tyranny this film is an important and ultimately uplifting testament."
"socrates99","9","1","2","15 September 2007"," Probably the most exquisite movie I've seen this year, at least
","At one point I thought I wouldn't be able to watch this movie to the end. What was depicted seemed to be inching into unbearable territory. If you react in the same way, continue on, the director does not slip into sadism, and, if you leave, you will have missed one of the best films I've ever seen. It's not that it inspires, or amazes, or dazzles with new ideas or incredible vistas, but, rather, it's because it makes East Germany and the Stasi (their secret police) accessible to us Western xenophobes in a way that even we will understand. And that's important, because there's no doubt in my mind, that is probably the direction this country is moving.<br/><br/>The story is about surveillance before the fall of the Berlin Wall of a talented and charismatic playwright and author, and his beautiful actress, girlfriend. Every scene is believable, and all the actors are superb. And the subject matter though dark is engrossing and quite relevant given our infatuation with Homeland Security. I loved the economy of the film. I can't think of a single scene I'd want to cut though the film is more than 2 hours long. It's a very, very rewarding 2 hours.<br/><br/>This movie was made with loving care and an abundance of talent, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to the most critical of moviegoers. It would be a tragedy if it played to only a small audience. It's sad that that's probably its destiny. It deserves much better. I'd love to see more depictions of what communism was really like from this director, and maybe even one showing it in a relatively positive light, if it could get past our censors."

As he begins to listen to the daily life of the writer and his girlfriend he finds that his life isn't what he thought it was.<br/><br/>At times cold and clinical this is movie is at once the type of movie that draws you in and keeps you at a distance. You're drawn in because you want to see whats going on, you're kept at a distance because our central figure is, at first very icy. All that changes as things go on as we, and he gets to know not only the people he's watching, but also because we, and he learns that the reasons for his watching the couple are something less than political. This is a movie that sucks you up and takes you along for the ride. If there is a flaw, its that the film, even when it warms up, still remains oddly detached.<br/><br/>I honestly can't argue with the win for best Foreign Language film at this years Oscars.<br/><br/>A potential word of warning- this is a talky film at times. The result is that the subtitling can be a bit of a battle as too many words go by too fast. It happens three or four times in the film, as part of wordy exchanges.

"monk_e_fish","9","1","2","22 May 2007"," Stylish and intelligent character study
","At the start of the 21st century, German cinema is again drawing audience attention as a new generation of directors and filmmakers are starting to make films that deal directly with the dark days of the country's 20th century history. So far Goodbye Lenin and Downfall have both gained significant critical acclaim and not insignificant audience figures the world over, however the Oscar winning The Lives of Others is definitely the pick of the bunch.<br/><br/>A quality piece of cinema for anyone, The Lives of Others is particularly impressive in coming from a first time writer-director, the wonderfully named Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Von Donnersmarck manages to combine a social comment on the dying days of the German Democratic Republic with an insightful character study and genuinely tense surveillance thriller. Von Donnersmarck does a fine job of bringing a sense of the bleak, grey quality of East Germany in the 1980s, expertly conveyed through the character of dedicated Stasi investigator Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler is the ultimate grey man, fading completely in the background even in some of his own movie, living a life of meticulous routine. In focusing the film on how Wiesler learns to appreciate a new view of the world in living vicariously through the artist couple he is listening in on, playwright Georg Dreyman and his leading lady Christa-Maria Sieland, von Donnersmarck is able to make a wider point about how the era of perestroika and glasnost came about through the ordinary people waking up to the life they could have more than changing views of their leaders.<br/><br/>The film also is an interesting and very real portrait of life in the security service that spied on virtually everyone and the atmosphere of fear this creates. Some of the film's finest scenes are those that revolve around the Stasi offices, combining the mundanity of lectures and office life with the chilling situation of having to watch everything you say and think. The opening of the film is a great moment, cross cutting Wiesler interrogating a suspect with him playing the tape of the interrogation to a class of young wannabe Stasi operatives as Wiesler demonstrates how to break down a suspect and the signs that he is lying. A particularly fine moment comes in forcing the suspect to sit on his sweaty palmed hands and then removing the seat he has been sat on in order to have something for dogs to sniff him out in future. Another fine moment has Wiesler and his superior listening in on a group of younger co-workers in the Stasi cafeteria telling an insulting joke about Erich Honecker, the GDR's head of state , the character who tells it is not seen again in the film until the end when he is seen demoted to steaming open envelopes. These nice little details are what really make The Lives of Others seem to exist in a very banal, real world making the disturbing levels of surveillance even more chilling. <br/><br/>In general, The Lives of Others is better at creating a human face to these Stasi characters than it is at making its dissident artists likable. Wiesler's superior, Anton Grubitz, is a self centred figure concerned largely with career advancement, however von Donnersmarck's writing and a strong performance from Ulrich Tukur manage to give him a sense of being a decent ordinary character who happens to work for a shady secret service. Dreyman and Sieland, however, come across as pretentious and self absorbed and one of the film's major weaknesses is that it never truly makes you care what happens to these two and this damages the effectiveness of the humanising of Wiesler as he observes them.<br/><br/>However, an exceptional performance from Ulrich Muhe manages to bypass this trouble as he makes Wiesler's transformation both realistic and compelling. Unlike the likes of Grubitz, it is clear that Wiesler really believes in what he is doing and is truly dedicated to the cause of what he terms ""socialism"" and has a professionalism other characters lack. However, he is a man utterly subsumed by his profession to the point where he appears to have little identity of his own, something well established by scenes of his monotonous home life. Von Donnersmarck, rarely for a first time writer director, does not over-write excessive levels of explanatory dialogue, relying on his leading man to bring a power to wordless scenes where Muhe shows in the smallest details Wiesler's emotional arc. There are some great moments as Wiesler begins to live vicariously through the more free living couple, the tear in his eye as he listens to the music they play or the moment in which he finally enters their apartment and is able to see all the objects he has only been able to picture in his head while listening in. <br/><br/>The film does eventually not quite know how to wrap things up with multiple endings and epilogues of ""two years later"" and then another ""two years later"", however the final moments are a sentimental, bittersweet scene which rounds off the film nicely while the shots of East Berlin in the 90s show a certain ambiguity to the end of the GDR, still grey and bleak only now the walls are covered in graffiti, a sign that people have more freedom but that life as a whole has not improved that much. The Lives of Others is an intelligent and gripping character study and one shows that we could be hearing a lot more from the name Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, which can only be a good thing as it is an excellent name. *****"

","This is a piece that well represents the pressure-cooker cultural experiment that was the DDR. We are privileged to observe it from our cinema armchairs and to see an unblinkered view. One gets the feeling that for the citizens of East Germany this was not the norm. It is interesting how much mundane living must have been documented by the regime in its attempts to root out all opposition.<br/><br/>As might be expected, the 'usual suspects' are the literary minds of this world and their potential to preach to their audience something subversive. However, it is actually jealousy from a high Party official over his girlfriend that instigates our fishing expeditionary investigation in Operation Laszlo.<br/><br/>Following the persecution of a colleague who has not worked for seven years, the playwright at the centre of the action receives a call to tell him of his friend's suicide. After the funeral, he learns that, despite the intensive statistical self-analysis of his society, no figures are available to indicate the prevalence or otherwise of death by suicide. He is convinced, against his deep-rooted loyalty to the regime, to write an anonymous propaganda piece to be published in West Germany exposing and denouncing the Eastern regime through this tiny fact.<br/><br/>The true hero of the piece is the mid-ranking investigating officer in the Stasi who is set the task of bringing down this inconvenient playwright. Discovering him to be a loyal and likable chap and his own superiors corrupt, this erstwhile cog in the socialist machine's control network decides to try to protect the girl from the unwanted attentions of the letcherous old Minister for Culture and his doctored reports place him in a very difficult position. Furthermore, he resents being ordered to set up the playwright to further his boss's political ambitions and the Minister's sexual ones. He rebels - hiding the identity of the author of the tract from his reports and removing incriminating evidence - on suspicion of which he is demoted for life ... or until the Wall came down.<br/><br/>There are some truly spine-tingling moments when we feel the fate of our protagonists balancing on a knife-edge.<br/><br/>The cold and methodical Stasi are an object lesson for us all. And we should not really feel so comfortable in our theatre armchairs. Some of the worst of them emigrated and now live under completely new identities. I have met the victim of one such person on a rapid and murderously ruthless path to quiet fortune and power in my own country."

","SPOILERS Communism is a failing theory. Surviving in China, history and the occasional student's misguided views, this bastardised socialism has all but fallen from existence. An ideal based system corrupted by the human need to be someone's superior, the theory cannot survive when put into practice.<br/><br/>Like most other ""isms"", Communism also remained fearful of alternative thought. Just like how Fascist Germany had the Gestapo to monitor people, so Communist East Germany (1945-1989) had the Staci. Believing that they should know everything about everyone, the Staci at their prime had most of the population working for them. In Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's ""The Lives of Others"", we focus on one fictional member of this group and the realisation of the true nature of his beliefs.<br/><br/>Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) has been a Staci member for twenty years. A quiet man, his ability to interrogate individuals and get the truth is respected and regularly used by his superiors. Yet when sent in to monitor a loyal writer, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), Wiesler begins, through the lives of others, to doubt and question everything he stands for.<br/><br/>A worthy Oscar winner, ""The Lives of Others"" is a reminder of just how dangerous certain establishments can be. Beautifully demonstrating the dull mechanised state created by an all controlling regime, it captures our minds and shows just how the allure of a bright, passionate, free world (dressed mostly in vivid reds) is so unnerving to the powers that be.<br/><br/>Whether in the general organisation and decoration of a location, or the way the people are taught to speak, Donnersmarck's film is perfect at showing two contrasting worlds. Everything in Wiesler's world is so stale and plain, that even when he tries to inject passion into this surrounding, he fails. Compare this however to the free, flamboyant life of Dreyman the artist, and you begin to reach for the same lifestyle, you begin to understand what Wiesler so yearns for.<br/><br/>Two scenes in this film which stands out as truly outstanding and which demonstrate this comparison involve sex. At one point in our movie, Wiesler is sat listening in and is absorbed as Dreyman and his girlfriend are hooked passionately together. Yearning for this close feel and the passion of the environment, Wiesler hires a prostitute. As he sits in his dull, emotionless room, and buries his head into the prostitutes breasts, he is crying out for a connection, for a link. He of course never receives this, and when the prostitute ups and leaves due to another client in thirty minutes, our hearts bleed for Wiesler. Here is a man who we are meant to despair and dislike, and yet through a combination of mood, writing and acting, we struggle not to root for his every success.<br/><br/>If anything, these scenes are the epitome of the film. They capture the essence of the whole concept and they are perfect. Whether it is the outstanding soundtrack, the passion of the story, the acting, the cinematography, every element of the film is defined to a tee here.<br/><br/>""The Lives of Others"" is magnificent. Beautiful to watch, and thoroughly enjoyable, I would recommend it to everyone. It is a reminder of a time when people were monitored by the oppressive state, and a reminder of why Communism ultimately fails. There are few films out this year that will come close to matching this title, and none with such relevant political views. Go out and see this today."
"tnrcooper","10","1","2","2 May 2007"," Incredible study of corrosive effect of eavesdropping
","This film won the Oscar for best foreign film in 2007 and from my point-of-view is quite deserving of the Oscar. I hear Pan's Labyrinth was fantastic and I heard also that ""Water"" was very good. That said, I do not think it would be a pox on the judgment of the Academy in the future that Das Leben was awarded the Oscar because I imagine it compares favorably, or at least is in the same class, as two of those other films, and probably the other nominees as well. The film covers the lives and activities of those on both sides of the Stasi (East German secret police) from 1984 over a period of several years and then tracks the fallout from this activity through the period around the fall of the Berlin Wall and into the early 1990s. The premise for the film is intriguing and unlike anything I have ever seen before. It follows one East German Stasi agent named Wiesler (a very controlled and seething and fantastic Ulrich Muehe) as he eavesdrops on the wiretapped apartment of a prominent playwright, Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) who the Secret Police wants to oversee because of concerns about his loyalty to the state. The do not have more specific suspicions than that, but the Stasi is feeling more pressured to uphold the image of Communism in East Germany and so they are cracking down on supposed heterodoxy in whatever form it takes. <br/><br/>As time goes on however, Wiesler becomes increasingly disenchanted with the surveillance which he is implementing for the Stasi and questioning of its purpose. He starts to wonder whether the surveillance of Dreyman and his girlfriend Christa Marie (Martina Gedeck) an artist who may or may not be as committed to resisting the pressures of the Stasi as he is Dreyman becomes increasingly involved in revealing a health problem in East Germany. This health problem is not widely known in the West. It is a complex and riveting movie about the changing loyalties and devotion of people to differing points-of-view. It is a film not to be missed about the development and changes of people. The direction by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is fantastic. The subtle shift in change of attitude for Wiesler, becoming more personally sympathetic while covering his tracks and prohibiting his advancement minded boss, the slithery Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur in a fantastically precise performance), in the hands of the wrong director, could easily change the tone of the film to the point that his opposition became obvious and the Stasi took obvious, punitive, humiliating retaliation against him. But von Donnersmarck is more interested in the subtle change of attitudes over time. Wiesler changes so subtly, that it is some time before the Stasi recognizes it and precisely because if his change of attitude happened very quickly he would have been eliminated instantaneously.<br/><br/>The film is an interesting study of the effects of surveillance not only on its targets and how their lives change, but also on those who do the surveilling. It is a reflection that surveilling exposes the agents to supposedly revolutionary beliefs and there is the chance that they will be changed by the people and beliefs that they are attempting to surveille."
"Masterofthesky1985","10","1","2","1 May 2007"," A Masterpiece! A Tale that vividly captures the very essence of the Human Soul.
","This is, without a doubt, one of the best films in the history of German Cinema. A tale of love, deception, humanity, and the essence of the human spirit, The Lives of Others not only accurately displays life in the GDR, but is nearly perfect on every level. Its scenery is absolutely sensational, the photography is excellent (not too ostentatious, but brilliant enough), the music score is nothing less than brilliant, and the screenplay is an absolute work of art in itself. The story involves an agent of the East German Stasi as he investigates the life of a writer and his lover. The story focuses on how, as he observes the couple's everyday activities, the agent gradually changes from his cold like, objective self, to a more human, warm, passionate, person; a Good man, as we are told in the end of the film. Unlike other East German films such as Goodbye Lenin!, which focus more on the nature of the Socialist Regime itself, the Lives of Others focuses more on human relationships and the goodness of mankind. In the end, it leaves us a very powerful message, a message that tells us that no matter how hard we are, how terrible we might seem, no one is corrupted, and everyone has a sensitive, kind, and loving person inside them. A naive dream perhaps, but the director makes it work to perfection to the point where we, as an audience are deeply moved by the film and begin to look inside ourselves for that ""good"" person we are told lives inside us. The story will make us cry, will make us question our stand in the world and make us realize how important goodness and humanity really is. I recommend this film to anyone... but fair warning first, this film is so good it will absolutely move you away from Hollywood Blockbusters and superficial, frivolous films.

The performances of Sebastion Koch and Ruehe as the Stasi officer are outstanding.<br/><br/>The film pictures the sometimes very harsh reality of the old GDR truthfully (I had many dissident friends over there during the 60s and 70s and visited the country frequently) and at the same time with warms and and a deep humanitarian understanding of life.<br/><br/>The author and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck can certainly be compared to the late Rainer Maria Fassbender, who died far too early and was - in my eyes - underrated internationally.<br/><br/>I am sure we can expect more grand films from this director."
"ablewisinithaca","10","1","2","29 April 2007"," Perfect
","This is one of the finest films ever made. It has the depth and the emotional intensity usually only found in great literature. To the best of my knowledge it captures the hapless idealism and the cynical thuggishness of East Germany's ""really existing socialism"" in a perfectly contained story resolved in a perfectly human way. After I saw it, a friend asked me how I would compare it to other films I had seen, and I honestly could not think about any other films. I could remember titles of course, but my mind was filled by this one. It is a masterpiece of understatement and rewards the attentive viewer completely."
"Andy-296","9","1","2","25 April 2007"," Great movie - just a notch down a complete masterpiece
","The Lives of Others is a great, even excellent movie. I can't give it a 10 out of 10 rating, though. On the plus side, the director has a total command of the medium, he knows how to make a suspenseful, thoughtful, entertaining movie, that holds the interest of the audience even at a running time that exceeds 2 hours. What's more, the acting is uniformly extraordinary. Let's talk now about the main reason why I can't give the movie a 10. The emotional heart of the movie is when the Stasi officer in charge of spying the playwright and his girlfriend, a very tough and experienced individual who presumably has worked in many similar cases before, decides instead to protect them. Why he would do that, risking an end to his career and even a charge of treason?. Though his motivations are not altogether clear (he is an extremely reserved man), the change of heart seems to happen in part after listening the playwright playing a sonata on the piano after learning one of his colleagues committed suicide, after years of harassment by the government (he is also uneasy after finding out the Stasi is going for the playwright not for ideological reasons but in order that his beautiful girlfriend would then be available for the repellent minister of culture). As a metaphor from his newly found sensibility, he even steals a book from Brecht from the playwright's house, and is seen reading it. Is this believable? As much as the audience would be moved by a story of redemption, I think it's not. This is not a minor quibble, since this change of heart is really the main plot twist of the movie, on which all the film is build. The ending has a great closing line, but is also a bit difficult to accept. From what I know, few if any Stasi officers have expressed any remorse from what they did, and continue to defend their actions. That aside, this is a great film, from a young director that really knows how to make a movie that is both highly entertaining and thought provoking. And it has many great scenes that you vividly remember later. The best one: the young Stasi officer making a ill-timed Honecker joke in the cafeteria. It's a scene that's so good on so many levels."
"cannarsi","9","1","2","24 April 2007"," Indisputably a masterpiece
","This film is a must-see, especially for those born in the 70's like me. Behind the same events that we have watched on the news there were real lives, lives that seemed ordinary but were actually lived under the frightening control of Stasi. Ordinary people were forced to live in lie and suspect, and their lives could be shattered for a word or the caprice of a party executive. This films depicts all that with compassion but without any 'rehabilitating sympathy'. <br/><br/>You will see a variation of Wim Wenders' 'angel' topic - the Stasi watchdog acts like Wenders' angels in the life of Christa. He is a know-all character (not because of divine nature but because he has been spying everything that's going on in the house) and cannot reveal himself, but succeeds in changing the course of events with a minimal intervention.<br/><br/>The parallel with Nazism is very smartly dealt with, in a rather symbolic way, in the scene where Christa dies - a close-up on her face shows she's wearing a white bathrobe with a yellow, five-pointed star on it. Lovely!<br/><br/>I praise the German film maker, who is continuing a very interesting process in which the German are reconsidering and re-evaluating their history. Sadly, Germany is the only country in the world to have suffered from both Nazi and Communist dictatorship. I really admire how the German are re-reading their own history - in literature, films, and so on - understanding and narrating the suffering of people, yet not diminishing their responsibility.<br/><br/>Sadly enough, after watching the film, one may wonder if it is this Europe of bankers, corporations and bureaucrats in which the difference between the rich and the middle class is getting bigger, if it is this world of American arrogance leading to some equivalent forms of control, that dissidents in the former USSR-controlled countries were fighting for."
"ThomasKus","10","1","2","14 April 2007"," Remarkable period piece
","As someone who grew up in the East German era depicted in this film I have of course two advantages - the language and the personal experience. The Lives of Others deals with a topic that had infiltrated East German lives to a still unknown degree and it is to the credit of the film makers that they have tackled this in a remarkable way. The story centres around a Stasi officer who is put on the trail of a writer and his intellectual friends. With time he becomes gradually absorbed with their lives eventually turning from interrogator to protector. The script is tight, the atmosphere both bleak and electric, the acting superb and the sets full of accurate details that give this film an air of real authenticity. That there is dramatic over-expression of certain aspects of Stasi working is inevitable but does make the film a little unbelievable at times. It is worth remembering that the director is West German and presumably had no personal experience of living in East Germany hence the film sometimes feels like expressing how West Germans imagined life in East Germany. However, this is perhaps not a bad thing as it makes the film more accessible to Western audiences and I have no doubts that the Oscar was well deserved. It is worth watching for the insights into both East German state and intellectual thinking of the 1980s and the story itself is gripping enough for two hours of good cinema."

","This is the best movie I have ever seen about life in socialism. It manages to keep the viewer in suspense all the way through, it can give hope or make the viewer feel fear for the characters' lives, and it certainly breaks all stereotypes, showing that even the people working in the National Security Services had humanity within them.<br/><br/>What I found most interesting about it was the manner in which it portrayed its characters - they were capable of inhumane sacrifices, of unthinkable trust and love, going to the point of risking their own lives for the others. Totally opposite to them, there were also characters who would go to any extreme to self-satisfy themselves and to make sure that their desires are fulfilled. It is surely a movie about extreme altruism and extreme egoism...<br/><br/>It is definitely worth seeing!!"

I was totally engrossed by the story, and for the story itself too, not for its credibility although I'm convinced it's in the scope of reality but for the way it was delivered. I did meet someone in relation to my job who told me what it was like to live in these days and this situation. He was from Hungary, if you've seen the film you might appreciate what Hungary must have been like in comparison to East Germany. Well yes in the final analysis it's a feel good movie but thanks to the clever direction it receives and takes. I appreciated so much the way the end is handled. I recently started to do something different with my visit to IMDb before ""putting my 5 cents"" I read the default setting comments that is best first. Then I change the filter to ""Hated it"" Because it's interesting to read why some people don't like a mostly popular movie. I did not tick their comments as helpful, yet in someway they were but I don't think they put their comments to win a popularity contest and I have little knowledge about the subject to take side, yet I can imagine the difficulty one would have to appreciate a work that portrays something quite different to what one believes to know very well. As for me the story worked very well the characters were so well represented and the ending somehow contributed to restored some faith in human beings"

","""Beat your wife regularly, even if you don't know why, she will."" I doubt the Arabs really invented that saying but it seems like every totalitarian system was based on the idea that no one can make you feel guilty without your consent. Stasi didn't spy on potentially guilty people, but people were guilty already of that suspicion. <br/><br/>Stasi: a simple whisper of that name was enough to send shivers down the spine of millions of citizens of the German Democratic Republic. It is not even far from reality to say that the population was divided in two: those who were spied and those who spied, some could slip through the net but for how long? The Stasi used spying and intimidating methods that had nothing to envy from the way Gestapo could treat the German population, and the opening of ""The Lives of Others"" sets the tone.<br/><br/>Wiesler, a Stasi agent, is giving a course. He explains to his students the virtues of keeping a prisoner awaken for forty hours, the so-called arrogance he displays will inevitably be broken. With a no-nonsense didactic tone, he reveals all these little tricks that allow the police to spot the guilt, an innocent person will shout in rage, a guilty one will weep and beg for mercy, a truth will be formulated in different ways but a lie is always made of the same lines. It is tragic that such methods existed, and even more that they sometimes worked. <br/><br/>With cold detachment but impressive competence, Wiesler says more about the Stasi than a one-hour documentary, and from the start, the young director Donnersmarck shows a remarkable attention to small details. Notice the scene when a student questions the humanity of the methods, everyone can see Wiesler putting a cross under his name but it's not in the mark, but in the discreet and smooth way he does it and then immediately answers the question. Notice also the prisoners asked to keep his palms on the chair so that the sweat on the cushion can be used for bloodhounds, this element never serves the film but it conveys one crucial element: the Stasi has an eye for detail, and so should we, if we want to appreciate or understand what happens.<br/><br/>This attention to detail says even more: anyone could be submitted to surveillance on the basis of suspicion, something that doesn't feel 'right'. When Wiesler is invited to see a play from writer Dreirman (Frederick Koch), all it takes is a simple look at that handsome long-haired man with an opened shirt, and a lovely woman, actress Christa-Maria (Martyna Gedeck), to suggest an investigation. Dreyman did nothing wrong but he's too well-established to be totally clean and something about his friends doesn't feel Kosher, so the Minister (Thomas Thieme) approves, moved by selfish reasons. His last feat was to forbid acclaimed author Gershka to work, when Dreirman defends his friend, the Minister denies such things happen and invites Dreyman to moderate his words.<br/><br/>Yet Gershka is the specter of what awaits Dreyman: losing your job, your contacts and the freedom to leave the country, not that everyone wanted to leave Germany, and the height of irony is that many artists were socialists (and would never be as creative as under the totalitarian regime). The veiled threats of the Minister, the situation of Gershka and the relative comfort bourgeois Dreirman lives in, are so many parameters to take into consideration, it's all about choices that jeopardize your life, it's a choice he has to make, and in the movie, choices are often driven by fear. It is very interesting that the biggest ""thrills"" of the film come from situations where we fear for the protagonists, so we have a taste of what life under this regime was.<br/><br/>But what makes the story so unique is that we have two persons who couldn't have been more opposite. Dreyman represents life, conflicts, torments, problems with his work, friends, life, courage or lack of, while Wiesler is a professional agent: he's alone, all dressed in gray, has sex with prostitutes, it is like his existence has been totally dedicated to his job, but by following the daily life of Dreyman, a strange juxtaposition of feelings occurs, he starts to discover a strange one some would call ""empathy"". The film then becomes a character-study about a man who supposed to study people and we witness his slow but progressive coming-to-realization on the tragedy that people live. There's a magnificent scene with a little boy that shows how Wiesler's foundations are being shaken, for the best.<br/><br/>Now, what is exactly ""Lives of Others"" about? Some would suggest that it is the intrusions into people's private lives and the lessons for today's generations, why are we so content to share our opinions and private lives on social media while they can backfire at us? And what lessons can the free world give when the threats of aggression from the exterior are always served as excuses to intrude into people's private lives? Recently, my Facebook account was blocked because I used a nickname, I'm supposed to send them an ID card to have my account back, that alone gives me an idea of how deeply attached to my privacy I am. Perhaps the worst aspect of the Stasi is that it is somewhat relevant today, in this post-9/11 world.<br/><br/>Or maybe the film is simply about goodness and humanity? About the fact that a malevolent presence can as well become a guardian angel, because it takes to get deeper in people's lives, to feel their flaws and weaknesses to realize the extent of the harm... On many levels, the film is inspirational and no one can't resist to the ending, a magnificent visual epitaph from Ulrich Muhe who sadly passed away one year after the film, but whose performance enriched the lives of the ""others"" that we -movie lovers- are."

","This movie reveals the detail and depth the Stasi went in to intruding and spying on the lives of the citizens of the DDR. It is eye-opening and very informative for those who do not know a lot about the DDR. Two themes of this movie, love and watching, are present throughout the entire film. Wiesler is desperate for love or even just a human connection. Dreymann and Christa-Maria have a strong relationship, even after it is tested by Christa's questionable actions. Wiesler longs for this kind of love after observing it day after day. Wiesler observes Dreymann from afar at the play, and the Stasi soon begins to spy on him as well. The neighbor across the hall watches out her peephole at what has been done to Dreymann's apartment. Another theme is change. Hempf says that people can never truly change, but we see that this is not the case through Wiesler's softening and sympathy for Georg and Christa Maria. Wiesler begins to care truly care for the writer and his girlfriend whom he spies on. He takes risks that could cost him his job because of the empathy he has gained through intruding on their lives. He even makes a point to tell Christa Maria that she is a great actress and that many people love her when he gets the chance. This movie is very well done and thoughtful. The only downfall to this film, perhaps, is how sad it is, particularly the ending."
"dancer-27792","10","1","3","27 October 2016"," An Unexpected, yet Intriguing Story
","For those who love history, this movie is for you. As a college student in the United States I only knew about the DDR from what I had learned in history classes and the little I learned from traveling in Europe. I could never fully imagine the effects that the wall and the Stasi had on the people of Germany. Das Leben der Anderen gives an outsider an inside look as to what East Germany was like. Wiesler is a Stasi captain who has been assigned to monitor Georg Dreymann, a German playwright who is trying to get support for his friend Jerska who has been blacklisted by the German government. Wiesler bugs Dreymann's apartment, and he is soon thrust into the world of the writer. Though this starts out as a simple mission, Wiesler begins to see how the government has affected these people. He begins to care about Dreymann, especially towards the end of the movie. One of the main arguments that is brought to attention in the film is that people never change. Obviously that is not true. The most significant change throughout the film is Wiesler. He doesn't view his job as a simple mission anymore. He has to protect the people that he has grown to care about, even if it ends up costing him his job. The film shows that people can change. Wielser is always associated with the color gray, a very neutral color. This shows that not everything can be black and white. One must dig deeper to see the true nature of people. It shows the darkness that was within Germany, parts that those who didn't live in the time may not fully understand until seeing the film. I think everyone should see this film because it brings history to life. There are so many layers to every aspect of this film. Each time you watch you can find something new that you didn't notice before. It truly makes you think."
"matthewmeyerhuber","10","1","3","26 October 2016"," A heart-wrenching window into the workings of the Stasi and the GDR
","The Lives of Others shows the ways in which the Stasi manipulated and intruded on the lives of East German citizens. The strength of this portrait is in its portrayal of Haupmann Gerd Wiesler as surprisingly human. But: what does it mean to be human? A recurring theme in German history is that of humanity and evil: are evil people human, or monsters? Or are humans really just evil? Such questions come up repeatedly throughout the film. Georg Dreymann and his girlfriend Christa-Marie Sieland are the primary objects of surveillance throughout the movie. Dreymann is a playwright known for his humanistic portrayals—his plays are, in the words of Minister Hempf, optimistic and full of hope. Hempf replies to this by telling Dreymann that ""people don't change (themselves)."" The tension between Dreymann's worldview and that of Hempf plays out in Wiesler's character development. At the beginning of the film, Wiesler matches Hempf, as he tirelessly and zealously seeks out ""arrogant"" enemies of the state. His perception of humanity is that they must be monitored carefully. It is as if Wiesler considers himself something inhuman, and this is evidenced by his Spartan existence. Even his haircut appears severe; his apartment is empty, and his kitchen bare. Wiesler knows nothing of the comforts of home, or family, or love. Yet, as the film develops, he begins to desperately seek the things he encounters in the lives of others. First, he seeks substitutes and living vicariously, hiring a prostitute and entering Dreymann's and Sieland's apartment just to experience it. However, he later takes on a more active role, sympathizing with Dreymann and the other playwrights, and even their subversive activities. The climax of Wiesler's development comes at the death of Dreymann's friend and colleague Albert Jerska. Dreymann plays The Sonata for a Good Man. ""Can anyone who has heard this music— really heard it—be a bad person?,"" Dreymann asks. Wiesler, with a tear streaming down his face as he hears the music through his headphones, has heard the music. Wiesler eventually pays the price for his sympathy with his career. At the fall of the Berlin Wall, he is found opening letters in a windowless basement; when he learns of the end of the wall, he walks out, abandoning the GDR for good. Meanwhile, in the coming years, Dreymann discovers that whoever was monitoring him had helped him escape certain imprisonment—a man identified only by his name HGW XX/7. He dedicates a novel, The Sonata for a Good Man, to HGW XX/7. Wiesler, working as a postman, sees the book in a bookstore and reads the note from Dreymann. As Wiesler takes the book up to the counter, the cashier asks if he wants it gift wrapped. ""No,"" Wiesler says, ""it's for me."" <br/><br/>Overall, the film is one of the best-done works I have ever seen. Typical of German cinema, it's incredibly deep and thoughtful, and leaves a strong impression. The Lives of Others is one of the saddest movies, but also one of the best."
"Schwag09","9","1","3","7 September 2016"," One of the best foreign films in recent memory
","The Lives of Others is a German film that tells the story of two artists living in East Germany during the height of the Cold War. The Ministry for State Security, or Stasi, knows no limits to its surveillance power and has taken a special interest in the artistic community. Despite their unwavering faith to each other, we play witness as these two lives become further and further intertwined with the State Security. The Lives of Others will leave your heart pounding and mind racing as you become engrossed in a world of deceit and passion. The plot is methodically revealed to you in such a way that you're aware of where you're headed, but shocked when you get there. It draws you in and leaves you feeling as though you have truly peered into – the lives of others.<br/><br/>Georg (Sebastian Koch) is a playwright who walks the line between obedience to the Party and his moral compass. He frequently surrounds himself with intellectuals with more fervor than he, but manages to stay on the Party's good side. Change is a constant theme throughout the film and Georg's life is no exception. As he slowly sees his world crumbling before him he becomes more and more impassioned. A dear friend hanging himself is the catalyst for a shift in Georg's writing style. After such a traumatizing event his close friends no longer seem so radical.<br/><br/>Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) is Georg's girlfriend and actress in several of his plays. Their romance grows as the film progresses and leaves them both feeling as though nothing else matters. However, her flourishing acting career has garnered her some attention from the Stasi. She too is forced to choose between allegiance to the State and her moral well-being. Throughout the film her choices have the most impact on others. Although unreliable at times, we feel inexplicably drawn to her. Her presence on-screen is intoxicating, which is perhaps why we see events unfold as they do. Despite all evidence to the contrary we choose to trust where she takes us.<br/><br/>Weisler (Ulrich Mühe) is a veteran of the Stasi and prisoner interrogation. A slave to his own stoicism, he leads a simple, calculated lifestyle that revolves around his allegiance to the State. He is well-versed in taking people to their breaking point and his latest assignment is to surveil Georg and Christa-Maria. As he immerses himself in their lives he begins to question everything around him and everything he's ever known. He travels deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole until he's completely lost his sense of up and down, and right from wrong. If Christa-Maria is the catalyst for change then Weisler's transformation creates the largest explosion.<br/><br/>The Lives of Others leads you through a tangled web of interactions and leaves you feeling as though you yourself have been ensnared. Ulrich Mühe delivers a captivating performance, perhaps the best of his illustrious career. Overall the film was one of the best foreign films in recent memory, and was recognized as such. It won Best Foreign Film in 2006 after narrowly edging out another of the great foreign films in recent memory – Pans Labyrinth. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brilliantly commands the pace of the film through the lens of the camera, the claustrophobia inducing sets, and the haunting score. This film is definitely a must-see."
"sreeduttasamanta","9","1","3","21 August 2016"," the lives of others
","In the stifling atmosphere of communism where even the most private thoughts are read every seconds, a Stasi official named Weiseler weighs his humanitarian feeling over his duty to the government and learns the meaning of love , sacrifice etc. This movie called ""The Lives of Others"" shows us that life is impossible to understand or judge unless looked at it from its own point. The movie's first opening scene shows us Weiseler's unwavering loyalty towards the party and he suspects Georg Dreyman, a writer, of sedition when he is thought to be an ideal citizen by many others. Henceforth a secret operation is ordered by the minister of culture at Dreyman's house with Weiseler in charge of it. From that point he starts to intervene in the lives of Dreyman and his girlfriend Chirsta Maria Seiland and gets to know every personal thing in their lives. He eventually comes to know that the cultural minister is nothing but a competitor of Dreyman and misuses his power to get Christa. When he comes to know that the communist party head (the cultural minister) behaves like a bourgeois and moulds the communist rules according to his whims and fancies, his loyalty which was entirely directed towards the government becomes divided and he empathizes with the lives of Dreyman and Christa Maria Seiland. He becomes a soft- hearted man and tries to save them at every possible opportunity. He does not report that Dreyman has written an article about the movie director, Jerska's death which is prohibited by the law. He also removes the typewriter from under the door sill which would have been a concrete proof that Dreyman is anti-national and he would have punished or killed. After a few years, the communist regime breaks up and he no longer is a stasi official, but a commoner. I liked the last part when he goes to the bookstore to buy a book by Georg Dreyman and the owner asks ""Should I pack it?"" He tells ""No, It is for me."" which has double meanings. One is that he bought the book for himself, another is that the book was written by Dreyman about him, the Stasi official who saved his life."

","I can see why this movie to Best Foreign Language category at the 2007 Academy Awards. The story is never less than totally absorbing and at times gripping and deeply moving. Both Dreyman and Wiesler's characters are fascinating studies in character performance from Sebastian Koch and Ulrich Muhe. Indeed, Muhe's laconic, deadpan, emotionless delivery seems suitably creepy for a highly trained, efficient Stasi agent. Yet it belies a hidden tenderness and respect for his prey, as he foils his own side to retrieve the dissident's hidden typewriter and thus prevent a prison sentence for Dreyman. The movie also works well as a critique of the crushing nature of the East German state apparatus, and how it manipulates people against each other, like Dreyman's girlfriend and his neighbour. Also the abuse of power by senior officials who are able to blackmail citizens for their own purposes as in the case of Minister Hempf. My description probably makes this sound really bleak - not a barrel of laughs. But I would really recommend watching this - the ray of light - Wiesler had a conscience after all. Stasi Agents were not all evil."

","I just watched this film on BBC2 last night, had never heard of it before but was captivated.<br/><br/>I never went to the former DDR until last year, but worked in West Germany at exactly the time portrayed here, the mid-1980's, height of the Reagan area. There was a huge feeling of rivalry between West and East Germany, every product which by then was coming over from the ""Ostis"" was derided in West Germany. There are also hints of the former tension between Prussia, and Saxony which was 100% in the East. Certainly any report in ""Der Spiegel"" would have triggered such a fury in the ranks of the East German regime at that time.<br/><br/>I met someone who had just come over from the East, working in a factory. He was genuinely scared, like the guard in the canteen, of making jokes about the regime, in my case I made a joke on a tram ride with him about the USSR football team beating Hungary 4-0.<br/><br/>To me the weirdest part is the STASI typewriter-expert, who can tell where all the official typewriters are and what makes etc. What happened to this kind of nerd when the Wall came down?<br/><br/>All in all a gripping film, well-acted."

","Lives of others<br/><br/>well for me i have following comments to offer<br/><br/>1. Beautiful acting , good cinematography. we could make a similar movie in India though i doubt any regime in India ever went to this length. 2.To me very strong was the notion that perfectly normal people can be hooked to a system so bad. All of them seem to have a noble goal in mind to keep fascism at bay. They think that they should go for socialism as capitalism will ultimately lead to fascism. But in order to achieve this bigger goal they compromise on every small step and become enemies of their own citizen.<br/><br/>3. I believe that this is what is bound to happen in India. Hindu nationalists have a laudable final goal to save India from Islamic tyranny but in this quest they may damage Indian psyche also.<br/><br/>4. Once again one sees power of art in this movie. I think despite all shortcomings our race has one distinct feature which makes our lives worth living i.e. pursuit of art forms. Artists in this movie like in real life are motivated to take risk and make society as they see in their dreams.<br/><br/>5. Corrupt minister who would have once started as an idealist but now is a cogwheel in system.<br/><br/>6. Rival officer of protagonist who is equally efficient and helps system on the plea of being honest to his job. I think this is very much relevant to my generation today when we shrug off our questionable role in perpetuating many wrong things by simply saying that we are just doing our job maybe we also need to witness lives of other to arouse that humane inside us."
"Tweekums","9","1","3","14 June 2009"," A tale of redemption in a totalitarian regime
","I was expecting this film to be a bleak critique of the East German regime, especially the dreaded Stasi, while that is there it is only part of the film, it is also an uplifting story about the redemption of one member of that organisation.<br/><br/>Gerd Wiesler is an officer in the Stasi and he clearly believes that his work rooting out those who oppose the state is a just cause and that those he investigates deserve everything they get. A friend and senior officer instructs him to investigate a playwright who had previously been considered loyal to the state. Gerd does this by bugging the writer's apartment and maintaining round the clock surveillance. Initially the writer says nothing to incriminate himself even when in the presence of more radical friends. However when a friend commits suicide he realises something must be done and writes an article which is to be smuggled over the border and printed in a West German magazine. Normally he would have been caught long before he finished but Gerd does not report everything that he hears. The story is complicated by the fact that the writer's girlfriend, an actress, is also involved with a senior party member and is taking illegal medication, this of course is the real reason that Gert has been given the job.<br/><br/>Those viewers expecting a spy film with chases, explosions and plenty of action will be disappointed, however people wishing to see a tense thriller that gives us a glimpse at how life can be in totalitarian regimes will be in for a treat and may end up shedding tears of both sadness and joy. The acting was very good, especially on the part of the late Ulrich Mühe who plays the conflicted Stasi officer.<br/><br/>These comments were based on watching the film in German with English subtitles."

Georg is a playwright/poet who does and says all the right things but ends up having his every move ""watched"" because a powerful politician lusts after his girlfriend. Georg is played wonderfully by Sebastian Koch, who was also excellent in this years' ""Black Book"" ... a must see for those who enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Georg's girlfriend, Christa, is played by Martina Gedeck (terrific in 2001 ""Mostly Martha""). The subtleties of this performance can probably only be truly appreciated upon numerous viewings.<br/><br/>The most interesting of all the characters is HGW, played convincingly and chillingly by Ulrich Muhe. A no-nonsense, black and white loyalist who slowly and ironically comes to appreciate life by spying on those who are a threat to liberty.<br/><br/>This story is so complex, yet so easy to follow ... it is an example of brilliant writing and direction.

","I had heard a lot of good things about this movie so I was very interested to see it. Nothing I read prepared me for the experience. Herr Von Donnersmarck's use of camera angles and movement of the camera on stationary actors does an amazing job of creating suspense and just pulls you into the movie. Zemeckis used a feather in Forrest Gump to draw you to the edge of your seat and keep you there. Von Donnersmarck draws you delicately through outstanding character development with exceptional use of the camera and an outstanding cast and script.<br/><br/>** SPOILER ALERT **<br/><br/>Not since the death of Hana in The English Patient have I so felt the loss of the one left behind as the one in which Georg loses Christa-Maria. The pain is so real because you are so empathetic to the characters at this point in the movie that you literally feel as though you lost you own lover or sister, or other family member. Sebastian Koch's Georg is expertly developed and Christa-Maria's battles with herself and Georg are believably portrayed through the electronic eyes and ears of Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe). It is Wiesler's development and evolution from hard-core Stasi party-liner to a very human and caring sole that is most compelling. The best acting in the movie comes from Muhe (although the entire cast is exceptional!) as he begins to feel for the objects of his surveillance as we do. And the walk off line of this movie should go down with ""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" as one of the best ever. This movie is so great on every level - script, directing, acting, and cinematography that I can't find anything bad to say about it. It truly is an ""experience"" and one I recommend you take the time to see."
"cestmoi","10","1","3","15 February 2007"," The Wall of Monsiuer Hire
","The performances in this film are perfectly tuned. The set design is incredible, the cinematography stunning, the lighting as it should be, the script fine, the music perfectly chosen, and the morality of the tale unquestionable. The first half hour of the film seemed a little over the top (unintended word play, think The Wall), mainly due to the monotonal quality of Ulrich Muhe's character, but that performance is reasonable in the context of the whole. The secondary slow development problem is related to the historicity of the piece, which gets a little newsreely in tone early on. BUT, and that is a big but, the film as a whole works superbly. The M. Hire in the headline summary is because of the similarity of character, in major part, to that of Michel Blanc in the brilliant French film of that title based on a Simenon novel. It, too is about deception and betrayal and integrity. Sebastian Koch who gives a very fine performance, bears an uncanny resemblance to the late Canadian American television journalist, Peter Jennings, and his style reminded me of a Scandinavian actor in a rather cultish philosophical group whose name eludes me, in particular a film about a rich man's retirement party he gives in praise of himself. It could be purely physiognomy (the son of the retiring monster) but it did occur to me while watching. Touching for the pure human aspect of the film, the heroic humanity of some characters, the subtle and visible transformation of the true believer (Muhe), the cumulative power of all of the aspects of the film is very strong. If there is any better framed and art designed film in the past year I did not see it."

Then I learned the rating my favorite critic gave it (5/5) and became curious about this movie. So a friend and I went to see it and I gotta admit, it's quite a decent movie! At least, far better than the (in my view) horribly overrated ""Goodbye Lenin"". The story is exciting and keeps you fascinated till the credits roll which isn't standard, these days anyway. The actors are all together nothing less than terrific and there lays the biggest quality of the movie. The camera and the score aren't very good, neither are the settings. And the story, as well-written it is, has it's black sheep. For example, and this is a big SPOILER<br/><br/>now so watch out, dear reader, the suicide towards the end. Yeah, it's dramatic and surprising and all that but too constructed and built to fit in the realistic and authentic world the film claims to portrait. Next big SPOILER<br/><br/>comes right away, when I find myself obligated to complain about the first hour of the movie when the tough and rough Stasi agent Wiesler almost immediately falls in love with the lifestyle of his target. There it appears just too obvious that the length became a problem so the director had to rush through this part. <br/><br/>The SPOILERS end here. In the end what's left is a nice movie about loss and love in a place ruled by observation and terror. It claims to be like ""Full Metal Jacket"" but has more of the modern tales by Zemeckis and Besson. Besides these difficulties in matters of identity, it remains a good drama!"

","An extreme tale of subterfuge in the face of an oppresive government, one man finds the courage to make the world a better place, risking everything in the process. It's hard to imagine taking such a risk knowing the government is probably tracking your every move. Muhe (Wiesler) acted very well, forced to live vicariously through the people he spies on, desperately hoping for the same kind of personal connection that they have. In a world so closely monitored, the only retaliation one can take is relatively minor, so it's never a very thrilling or dramatic film. It also doesn't manage to capture the covert back-and-forth or hidden intentions as in great spy movies such as Red Sparrow. Despite the slow pace and muted events, I won't soon forget The Lives of Others."

Eventually, this man begins to realize the results of his actions and he tries to pull back his invasiveness. The scariest part of this film involves the tactics used to get confessions out of those singled out. Of course, when they can't get to the person, they threaten their wives and children. Of course, since this takes place in 1980, we are in the wake of the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Everyone should see this and think about its implications.

"Cosmoeticadotcom","7","1","4","1 September 2010"," Good
","The few critics of the film, naturally, frame their criticisms not artistically, but based upon the director's supposed failure to truly depict how hard life really was in East Germany, or that a Wiesler could not have existed in reality, for the Stasi was so paranoid about loyalty that they always worked in pairs, etc. Of course, these criticism miss the point as much as the positive ones do. That Wiesler may not have been able to exist in reality has nothing to do with the diegetic reality of the film, wherein he functions quite well, save for the rather thin reason for his 'treason.' As stated, it would have been more plausible if he protected Dreyman so that Grubitz and Hempf lost face, for abusing the 'good will' of the Communist state. Few critics, though, have commented on the drab visuals (including those not intended), the trite dialogue between the artists, and the presence of numerous melodramatic plot twists used merely to move the sometimes slow moving 137 minute film along (it could have lost 30 minutes to great positive effect). Despite this, it is a solid film, but one likely not deserving of an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Picture, which it won.<br/><br/>I mentioned its affinity to The Conversation, but this film is far more prosaic, and, as terrific an acting performance as Mühe provides, his character is simply not nearly as complex as Gene Hackman's Harry Caul, nor is his self-doubt as realistically (and, more importantly, effectively) depicted. He should have been protecting Dreyman to screw Grubitz, rather than for Dreyman's sake (or even because he, too, lusted for Sieland), because that would have been believable, and added layers of depth to Wiesler's conversion (so, too, could shading have been thus added to Wiesler's taking of the typewriter- is he protecting Dreyman, or trying to hide his own prior protection of Dreyman? But, that also would have required a depth of life experience and writerly ability that the callow Donnersmarck, and his rather straightforward plot, lacked. However, all in all, a good effort from a first time filmmaker, and one that deserved applause, if not all the plaudits it received. For all its flaws, the screenplay and film, at least, attempt something of depth, even if, overall, they come up short. Wiesler ultimately loses faith not in the 'system,' but in the people who run the system; this is why he is so disconsolate, even after the fall of the Berlin Wall, for his system is now dead.<br/><br/>The Lives Of Others does fall prey to the Day After Effect, for its flaws stick more than its good qualities, but it's worth a viewing for those good qualities, faithful or –less. And the number of films, American or not, these days, that can claim that, would take a far better interrogator than Wiesler to uncover."

Many such films show a hero who takes on the establishment, or an villainous officer who moves up in the ranks by destroying people. But ""The Lives of Others"" tells a very human story from the viewpoint of a Staci officer.<br/><br/>Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is an East German playwright who is surprisingly loyal to the state. Yet his loyalty arouses the suspicion of two Stasi officers, and they accuse him of conspiracy and subversion. So the Stasi assigns Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) to spy on Dreyman and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). The Stasi bugged the apartments and tapped the phone lines of the couple and their friends, and tried to turn one of their friends against them. Wiesler preceded to listen to every conversation they had over the course of five months. Complicating matters is Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme), who wants to have Georg arrested so he can have Christa to himself.<br/><br/>But as he listens to the intricate details of the couple's life together, Weisler grows to envy, respect, even like Georg and Christa. His character evolves from a cold robotic bureaucrat to emotional human. Mühe's performance as the Stasi captain is nothing short of brilliant. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, in his directorial debut, overlooks no detail as he puts his audience in 1984 GDR.<br/><br/>Far from nostalgic, ""The Lives of Others"" examines the power of the Stasi and its impact on the people of the GDR."

The Americans, more than any other nation in the world, have propagated the view that the American society and political machinery is rotten to the core. How delicious, then, finally to see a German film revealing the full horrors of the Socialist regime in DDR, and even better that it is well-acted and well-written. Based, presumably, on the idea of German writer Heinrich Böll's ""Die ungezählte Geliebte"", (the uncounted sweetheart) about an invalid who is hired by the establishment to count the people passing over a bridge, but who refuses to count the girl he has come to love from afar, ""The Lives of the Others"" is the story of the Stasi officer who suddenly finds that he has a heart and that he can no longer carry out the orders of a brutal system. Ulrich Mühe, the Stasi man Wiesler, or HGW, is particularly admirable in his poker face performance. The film's only drawback is the necessary leaps in time which detracts from the intensity of the story. But, above all, we should welcome more films of this kind, before we are cinematically mesmerized into believing that all the crooks in the world are Americans. Let's maintain a healthy balance."

Wiesler and his team bug the apartment, set up surveillance equipment in an attic, and begin reporting Dreyman's activities.

","It seems somehow appropriate that ""The Lives of Others"" should be set in 1984, since it takes us to a world where George Orwell's fictional Big Brother has become an all-too-real fact of everyday life. The place is East Germany, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, where not just every action but virtually every thought can be surveyed and monitored by the secret police agency known as STASI. As self-appointed ""voices of the people,"" artists suffer an even more intense level of scrutiny than the average, everyday citizen. As a result, many of them have either fled the country, committed suicide, or compromised their artistic vision in exchange for security and safety. Georg Dreyman, a successful writer and dramatist, has chosen the latter course of action, towing the party line in his works better than most of his fellow artists. Nevertheless, Wiesler, a security agent with STASI, suspects that Dreyman may not be quite the ideological purist Wiesler's fellow officers believe him to be (Wiesler may also be motivated by the fact that he is attracted to Dreyman's beautiful girlfriend, a well-known stage actress named Christa-Marie Sieland, and, thus, has reasons of his own for wanting Dreyman out of the picture). To confirm his suspicions, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment bugged so that he and Sieland can be kept under surveillance twenty-four hours a day. After awhile, however, Wiesler begins to soften in his stance towards Dreyman and, before long, he is betraying his own vows to the state by whitewashing his official reports on the writer.<br/><br/>Within this historical context, ""The Lives of Others"" provides a chilling portrait of what life is like under a totalitarian regime. It shows the dehumanization that occurs when freedom of thought and expression become anathema to a society, and the untenable paranoia that develops when one must live in constant fear of betrayal from stranger, acquaintance and loved-one alike.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the two main characters in the film share very little screen time together, yet they are intricately linked in their roles of the observer and the observed. Dreyman is a man willing to go along with a system he knows to be wrong, partly out of fear, but partly too out of a sincere belief that nothing he can do, even as an artist, will ever really change things. It isn't until a close friend of his, a ""blacklisted"" theater director, decides to take his own life rather than to live with the oppression that Dreyman wakes up from his lethargy and takes a proactive stance against injustice.<br/><br/>Wiesler has a less clearly defined moment of epiphany, and this strikes me as being one of the very few weaknesses of this otherwise extraordinarily fine film. If Wiesler has a literary antecedent, it would have to be Guy Montag, the fire-starting protagonist in Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451."" Like Montag, Wiesler is a gung-ho advocate of a regressive regime, eagerly performing his duty of stamping out what he believes to be seditious and subversive elements that threaten the stability of the society. But whereas Montag has his unmistakably paradigm-shifting moment while reading ""David Copperfield,"" Wiesler has no comparable event to explain his 180-degree turnabout in outlook. He just suddenly goes from being Dreyman's bitterest antagonist to his greatest protector and champion without a whole lot of explanatory detail to go along with the change. It's difficult for us to accept the fact that a man would suddenly turn his back on everything he's dedicated his life to without at least a vaguely articulated reason for doing so.<br/><br/>As Wiesler, the late great actor, Ulrich Muhe, leaves an indelible mark in his portrayal of a man whose cold, emotionless surface may be more the product of his environment than a reflection of the true man at the core of his being. In a largely nonverbal role, Muhe is forced to convey much of his character's thoughts, feelings and emotions through his piercing eyes and tightly pursed lips. Sebastian Koch brings a remarkable subtlety to the role of the writer, while Martina Gedeck as his girlfriend, and Ulrich Tukur as Wiesler's hardnosed superior deliver excellent performances as well.<br/><br/>In her film-making debut, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brings both a stunning attention to detail and a strong sense of atmosphere to her work. Given the repressive environment she is portraying, Donnersmarck wisely holds back on delivering grand sentimental gestures for most of the film - which makes the climactic moments all the more heart-wrenching and devastating when they finally arrive.<br/><br/>In this age of ramped-up fear and paranoia - and the increased scrutiny and surveillance that come along with them - ""The Lives of Others"" serves as a stark reminder of the things we lose when we give up our freedoms."
"oneloveall","7","1","5","17 August 2007"," Well made, though certainly short of spectacular
","Donnersmarck's much talked about film is certainly an impressive debut, pitting a suspenseful tale of political intrigue against East Germany's ultra-shady governmental proceedings during the mid-late 80's, but as per usual with most films containing any sort of bona-fide talent these days, remains over-hyped and over-rated. ...And a little overlong as well. Eventually many of the fairly dumbed-down script's (though certainly not by American mainstream standards) plot-twists become unimpressive, leaving me almost apathetic nearing the final stretch of character ambiguities. The film does end on a high note, rounding out some of the former repetitious tension (an oxymoron, no doubt) and lengthy chronology on a fairly just note. Just another one of the thousands of examples of excessive and lavish praise being heaped on a certain project, thereby dwarfing the effect from high expectations. The Lives of Others may gently explore many potent themes remaining crucial in our society today, though the film itself felt underwhelming to it's rewards ratio."

","This is a film about the extent of the Stasi's activities and the climate of fear in the GDR, and as such it is a film that needed to be made. Wiesler is a Stasi operative who is asked to monitor the activities of a playwright, Dreyman, and his partner, Christa-Marie Sieland. And that's what he does in 12-hour shifts each day. Amidst the greys, browns, yellows and greens of the camera, we see the lives of all three intertwine, although the couple are unaware of the extent. Gradually Wiesler comes to take pity on them and his actions for them provide the dramatic content of the film.<br/><br/>It is a good film as many others have said, but I don't think it is exceptional. There is no real explanation of why such an imposing Stasi interrogator (we see Wiesler doing this at the start of the film) suddenly becomes such a softy. Other than that, it is not the kind of film that I could sit through again, not because it is powerful (it can be at moments) but because it is cold; we are spies watching an agent watching the couple.

This week when I was trying to find out about this movie on the web, every web site critic had given high rating and rave reviews of the movie. And only after seeing the movie I knew that this movie has won the ""Best Foreign Film Oscar award"".<br/><br/>The story is set up in 1984 East Germany when the government monitored the lives of people through civilian informants. Ulrich Muhe plays Gerd - the civilian informant and Sebastian Koch (remember Zwartoek?) plays Georg - the journalist writer who is not considered loyal to East Germany. Georg is identified and every move of his is monitored meticulously. But the story's pivotal character is Ulrich who is trained like a machine / robot by Germans to perform a duty to minute every breath of Georg. The interesting part of the movie is the transformation within Ulrich into a human being. But the compelling part comes when the story brings Ulrich is called by duty to pin Georg. The last 40 minutes of the movie is very enjoyable and satisfying.<br/><br/>There is a bit of slack in the editing of some scenes where the flows of scenes are not in synchronization.<br/><br/>This is just the sixth movie of the young Director (he is just 34 years old) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, and I think he is done a marvelous job.<br/><br/>I liked the movie, I would not say I loved it.

If you as their compatriots know about any of that shameful subversive stuff, it's off to the Teutonic salt mines for you (or the equivalent).<br/><br/>This reminds one of more recent times when writers and journalists in other countries are criminalized for their modern ideas, spending lives in prison or jails of the mind - not to mention self-demise as happened to a movie director in this film.<br/><br/>This film: Rated ""R"".

Another man with a pay-by-the-half-hour ""professional"" hookup.<br/><br/>A red typewriter ribbon tells a lot. The portable typewriter itself is a significant character in this drama, and becomes an important piece of evidence.<br/><br/>This story is told in hindsight, perhaps in flashbacking. The main characters are, early on, tortured in many ways, but some actually live through the wall coming down and the nation of that time ceasing to exist into the future. Even some of the bad guys manage to make it to the new life. The playwright, earlier blackballed against writing because of his 'crimes', has now written a book on display in the Karl Marx bookstore. Scratching my head about old Karl. I thought that he was passé after the wall came down.<br/><br/>If you thought that Hogan's Heroes was funny, about an earlier Germanic time period, this film ain't hilarious, folks. There are no dumbkopf Colonel Klink or slow-on-the-uptake Sergeant Schultz, but there are high-ranking officers here wearing close-to-Nazi uniforms that remind one of World War Two.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Seeing the actress all bloody in the street, near the end, I remembered that I have studied acting many times and that this is all fake and that she is just playing a part. An actress was portraying an actress who was harassed by insane goons whose days were numbered. Earlier in this film, she was an actress in a play on stage while the goons scrutinized her with binoculars. I thought, ""This is a play within a play.""<br/><br/>I have critiqued films for IMDb since 2002. I take ongoing film studies coursework at university, and have a BA in History from there.

You could say this one was a far more satisfying psychological thriller. If only Hollywood could make movies like this. My only exposure to secret intelligence services is the alphabet soup of spy think tanks, but this is the first story about the German version of the vast Egyptian police network, al-mukahabarat, which gained power during reign of gamal abdul Nasser. It is very authentic, & a very slow, plodding movie. But it is necessary to view this rather than a slew of evil, nazi villain movies(house on 92nd Street comes to mind), or a bunch of silly dreck about hogan's Heroes duetschbags running around shouting Heil Hitler at each other. I wouldn't necessarily recommend everyone emigrate to Germany right now, & learn German culture, but I would certainly think about learning the German language after seeing this movie. It's the least I can do. It is a very authentic culture, but to appreciate it, you have to see the good with the bad. STASI, to me, was a post - war version of the gestapo. But this was also a country that gave birth to the magdeburg rights( named after teutonic city of Magdeburg, which is a german version of the Magna Carta, laid down foundation of how cities are governed.

"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","20 November 2009"," Taut and rather powerful German thriller focusing on the power struggle between a handful of people towards the end of a controlling era.
","The world in which The Lives of Others is set is a grey and frightening one; one that evokes fear, suspicion and tension. It takes place in a world and at a time that really existed; and amongst the vast, vast annuals of history - the period, or 'era', of mid 1980s East Germany is a fairly recent time and place as to which dramatic events should be observed as they play out. We may not be looking at a period in history that shaped how the world would turn out; nor indeed are we focusing on individual events or wars that formed new nations and beliefs - rather, the focus is on a handful of people and how their own lives are shaped by the state. The Lives of Others is more of a minute piece, it has that cold and intimate feel to it; that precise sensation of something being studied and etched out playing out amidst the Soviet controlled nation that was East Germany in the not so long ago late 20th Century.<br/><br/>The film is ten times the piece the recent Bourne sequels are. As a film exploring the practise of eavesdropping, spying and espionage; director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck opts for the polar opposite approach by painting a very grim and ominous backdrop of the time and setting via the cinematography, and constructs his film in a slow and very precise manner. Perhaps slow is the wrong word, I'm thinking more along the lines of 'calm' and 'patient', evoking a very visceral sensation for a lot of the time that reflects the action of spying and eavesdropping: a calm and patient approach to a task that takes time.<br/><br/>The film is the second of recent times from German film-makers exploring Germany's past and identifying past ideologies and beliefs. The other is Die Welle (The Wave), a film that explored the fanaticism and national interest behind politics and how seemingly easy it was to install a charismatic leader, garner attention and form minority factions amongst everyone else. The Lives of Others is a piece exploring Germany's past Communist driven areas, almost the whole of the East in particular, and how power; paranoia; gradual obsession and seemingly absurd political demands can lead to fear plus the actual eventual demise of people's lives.<br/><br/>The film is a series of exchanges between three primary individuals; a game of power play if you will. Sebastian Koch plays Georg Dreyman, a playwright living with a certain Christa-Maria Sieland (Gedeck) in East Germany, circa 1984. After attending one of his plays and observing the goings-on, Gerd Wiesler (Mühe) is adamant the above writer is suspicious enough to warrant a number of bugs be fitted to his apartment so that spying can be carried out, and observations made. When we are first introduced to Mühe's Wiesler, a lecture he is giving to budding students of the secret police are studying the arts of interrogation; an interrogation which is being revealed in tandem with the speech as the young learners watch on. The following scene sees Wiesler himself as an audience member, watching on from the confines of a balcony as a play gets underway. The notion of watching-on is made aware early on to us, that parallel between students observing a lecture and picking up on things followed by the teacher himself observing a performance and having his suspicions is apparent.<br/><br/>Mühe plays Wiesler to an absolute tee. His performance feels detached from the rest of the film, but in the nicest possible way - the manner in which he plays the character gives off an uncanny sense about him, as if he has stumbled in off another production. As everyone else around him performs to whatever degree they see fit, Mühe elevates his character onto another realm; echoing what other actors such as Hopkins and Bardem did in The Silence of the Lambs and No Country for Old Men, respectively. He comes across as colder than everyone else, as if he's been beamed in from another far off place. Wiesler is extremely robotic in his actions and movement, constantly clad in grey and neutral colours and nary giving much away by way of facial expressions. The man is creepy and mechanical in movement and professionalism; he speaks in short and to-the-point sentences and phrases. There's an odd scene in which he is caught asleep during a late eavesdropping session on Dreyman and his partner by the guy on the next shift; after which he gets up, thoroughly embarrassed and somewhat ashamed that he's been caught looking like a human being.<br/><br/>The film will branch out into all sorts of bother for the leads, in the sense illegal publications of articles on suicides and unregistered typewriters will be the order of the day. The film touches on themes of honour and guilt as Maria gets involved a little too deeply, and certain revelations cause Wiesler himself to question where his loyalties lie. Drenched in a metallic, stone-cold look and with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar under its belt, The Lives of Others is an interesting and brooding period piece that shines thanks to its impeccable directing, individual acting performances and menacing narrative complimenting its menacing aura."

","This is a great thriller! A thriller I could not say should have been made better. However as much as I liked the acting of the spy hero (Ulrich Mühe) I must say his suspicious character's constant demeanor appeared a little too melodramatic and throughout. Such being to the point where he would have surely raised the suspicions of the East German Police to his ultimate betrayal and at a very early stage during the movie. In a way I am sorry for this critique as I really loved watching this film and that of all the works of the late, great Ulrich Mühe (.. as many may already know, Ulrich Mühe passed away recently after suffering from stomach cancer at the early age of 51).<br/><br/>'Bravo' to the other participating ""Das Leben der Anderen"" cast and crew.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","1","28 November 2008"," Finally, a great film involving Germany that doesn't even mention World War II
","Life in Germany during the Berlin wall tends to get overshadowed cinematically by that war during the 30s and 40s. While countless films recall a plethora of WWII stories, few, and certainly none in recent memory recall the 1980s. ""The Lives of Others"" takes us to this critical time in history and really strikes at the global relevance of what was going on.<br/><br/>The film is German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's first simultaneously written and directed project and it recalls the days of the Statsi in East Berlin, who made it their business to know everything about anyone that might be disloyal to the socialist state of East Germany. A high profile couple of a writer and an actress become of interest and Wiesler, the main character, is in charge of listening in on their lives. Wiesler becomes attached to the couple and when their appears to be some anti-German Democratic Republic activity going on, Wiesler has a moral crisis on his conscience.<br/><br/>The film is not as much a moral dive into the voyeuristic tendencies of human beings, but it certainly calls on those elements as an entry point into the minds of the characters being spied on as well as Wiesler. It's more about identifying what ""doing the right thing"" really is. The concept is certainly not abstract or foreign (no pun intended) to film, but in the fresh historical context of Germany in 80s, it sheds a different light on the subject.<br/><br/>Donnersmarck handles this film with grace. He has some really powerful images and great edits (the opening sequence is flawless in alternating past and present clips) and in general tells a very quiet, basic story without any intense drama in a way that keeps you interested in what's going on or what will/will not happen to the characters. That's really something and I'm sure this film won't be the last he sees of the Academy Awards."

","A well known material,or just based on a material which is (could based on a true events)enough important to make films about it again and again.The director,writer of this film made movie which is enough strong in the right scenes to be memorable for a long time.The structure is mostly good,but there is some boring scenes at the start,and at the middle,but in these scenes the director trying to help us to know what was the situation in that time.And he did this with the dialogs.OK we can forgive this,I think it was not a big mistake.All the characters has something special,what is invisible for first look,but near to the end you will see that values.It's also important,cause the story has some used elements.Seems like the director wanted to make a film,which is not want to be a judge of political systems,but wanted to show what is the different among them."

","i liked this movie for its strong story line and wonderful performances from everybody. being a stranger to the political conflict in Germany before the wall came down, it wasn't difficult to get the drift of the movie. it means the movie that transcends all cultural-political barrier is a great achievement. in simple words, the movie takes you into the very heart of people who suffered under such absolute humiliations in the name of socialism. art, an expression of free will is taken as a symbol and the lives of a writer, his lover and the stasi inspector all come to life of their own. the writer is a very interesting character. and so is the cold hearted inspector. the beautiful lover reminded me of malena. a helpless woman driven to chose her fate at the cost of her freedom. u cant help but fall in love with her. in the midst of great turmoil this movie deals with ordinary lives with difficult choices to make."

","Quite simply one of the best films of the past 5 (maybe 10) years. A truly remarkable story coupled with brilliant acting, and one of the best scores ever. It breaks your heart then lifts your spirits. I know how corny that sounds, but it's true.<br/><br/>The only reason I hesitate giving it a 10/10 was it did seem to be a little hard on the women. Actually woman. The film kinda treats the lead woman as Eve. The men all skate, and the woman is seen as the evil one.<br/><br/>But it's really minor and that is nit-picking. Not enough to bring this film down. In fact, it might be a comment that I am trying to find fault in it b/c it is so flawless.<br/><br/>We in the US complain about our rites and liberties being trampled on. Berlin in 1984 we are not. This film shows how truly horrific the world was (and can be). But also does an amazing job showing that even the coldest human being can change. He can become good.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."
"CannibalisticCouchPotato","8","0","1","10 September 2007"," A very well made movie!
","The writer director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck has done a very competent job on this movie, everything seems to work and there was nothing badly done to jar you out of the reality of the story. The acting is deeply believable, the settings and situations all work and there is no sense that any scene has been needlessly add to satisfy some commercial demand or that any scene has been left out or fudged because of budget limits or problems with shooting schedules.<br/><br/>This competence is important because this movie could easily lose the audience if it flubbed things even a little or at least it could have lost me. It didn't though, it held my attention and I became engrossed in the lives of these characters.<br/><br/>Simple scenes take on new meaning because of the way they are interlaced, those of the observer and the observed. You know these people are being watched because powerful people are looking for an excuse to hurt them for petty selfish reasons or advance their careers.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece of competent film making, a simple story told with the utmost attention to detail."
"tributarystu","9","0","2","4 September 2007"," The Story With No Words
","It's the second time I've watched Das Leben der Anderen this year. That my initial viewing was less satisfying than the second, is the first thing I have to report. I've thought about the reason why and I believe to have stumbled upon one: with all the facts in, I could look more closely at the story of the man behind the story. A story of no words.<br/><br/>My first impression of this tale about the good old German STASI and its ways was that it might be a bit too optimistic. I bet my grandfather, who at his own time has been through the mystique of communist interrogations, would agree and deem it a propagandistic fairytale. As far as I'm concerned, now that I've come to terms with the aforementioned reality, I suppose I can accept that people such as HGW might well have existed and might just as well have been overlooked by this new, gracious system which engulfed the former ""democratic republics"" of the time. The world is full of people who undertake less obvious leaps for man and small steps for mankind.<br/><br/>I'd still rather have had Guillermo Del Toro's Labyrinth win the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, but it's surely not unusual for the deciding factors to prefer a deep story of human redemption to an actual R-rated fairy-tale. Fact of the matter is, both these films (Labyrinth and Life of Others) were films of totally superior class to the productions nominated for Best Picture at the same awards, which only comes to show (once more) how hollow prizes can be.<br/><br/>So why should you watch this amazing debut film, you might ask. Well, it's firstly because it's a modern day, more personal and more subtle Schindler-story and secondly because it offers some insight into an atrocious system, one that is often underrated as far as its inhumanity goes. Also, Sebastian Koch and the late Ulrich Muhe portray their characters in a most immersive manner, highlighting one very important fact: it's human nature that both sustained and eroded the communist system in its extreme form."
"ivko","8","0","2","25 August 2007"," What difference can one man make?
","'The Lives of Others' is a beautiful film about the power and frailty of life and love. Set in East Germany about 5 or 6 years before the fall of the Berlin wall, it is the setting for a story that is at once both a chilling reminder of the depths to which unchecked governmental power can sink and at the same time a beacon of hope that humanity cannot be totally crushed even in the most repressive regimes.<br/><br/>Ulrich Mühe plays Hauptmann, a cold ruthlessly efficient Stasi (the East German secret police, an Orwellian organization if ever there was one) agent assigned to monitor Georg Dreyman, a prominent playwright who is suspected of harboring anti-government sentiments. Hauptmann sets about prying into every aspect of Dreyman's life looking for dirt, but initially there isn't really very much to find. However, as he continues to devote his life to watching Dreyman's he begins to be drawn in by the life and love of Dreyman and his wife (Martina Gedeck), a well-known actress who is the one actually hiding some secrets.<br/><br/>Mühe plays his role of a man gradually earning his redemption brilliantly, allowing his human compassion to show itself little by little, odd and disturbing at times and genuinely moving at others. Ultimately, although Mühe is the hunter and Dreyman the prey, you begin to realize in a sense that they are both the victims of a brutal, inhumane system.<br/><br/>The movie is, as you might expect, all in German. So if you don't speak the language be prepared to read subtitles the whole way thru, but the movie has such engaging, powerful performances that I wouldn't let that dissuade you. An excellent film."
"Angeneer","10","0","1","11 August 2007"," Important and amazing cinema
","The Lives of Others was a special film even before it was made. It is the first introspective movie about East Germany. A long-awaited look into one of the most interesting large scale social experiments of the 20th century, the DDR. <br/><br/>Such a subject gave this movie tremendous potential, which thankfully it explored to the maximum. Yes, the critics are right, it is an amazing movie by all means. Technically, it is extremely well made. The scenario flows perfectly and the accomplished direction immerses the viewer in a dark and claustrophobic atmosphere. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck knows how to tell a story and makes a remarkable debut.<br/><br/>But in order to achieve true brilliance, the film also needed the classy performances first of the late Ulrich Mühe and second of Sebastian Koch. They truly take it off and bring their characters to palpable reality.<br/><br/>This is one of those films you physically feel the shiver of its greatness when the credits roll. Simply must-see."
"nobbytatoes","7","0","4","9 July 2007"," has its flaws, still an important film to see
","The real surprise on the 2007 Oscar’s had to go to, The Lives of Others, winning over the crowd favourite, Pan’s Labyrinth in the foreign language category. Maybe seeing The Lives of Others after this surprise win, when having back the crowd favourite, makes viewing hard, but all Oscar tid bits aside, The Lives of Others is a competent debut from writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. In 1984, when Germany is split into the East and West, member of The Stasi; government secret police, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is their top interrogator, and is compelled to surveillance play writer Georg Dreyman and his wife/actress, Christa-Maria Sieland, who seem to fit all the markings of a loyalist, but Wiesler and friend Anton Grubitz suspect a liar and a traitor. Wiesler heads the surveillance on Dreyman, though as Wiesler become more a voyeur of this couple, and Dreyman’s workings with the West, Wiesler is entranced by them, turning a traitor himself to save these two from Grubitz and the government. The Lives of Others is a grim reminder of life in a Totalitarian regime, nods to Big Brother and Orwell’s 1984. Donnersmarck writes with competence, utilising some provocative subject matter and some thrilling moments. The draw back is he doesn’t keep this at an even pace, dragging at times, though enough tightly executed scenes rise above this. There is a quite interesting scene with Wiesler and a child inside an elevator, and though Donnersmarck takes his time getting there, the coda and final moment is so poignant and heart felt. Performances all round are top notch, most notable are from Ulrich Mühe, saying so much with his expressionless demeanour as Wiesler, and Sebastian Koch as Georg Dreyman. Hagen Bogdanski’s cinematography and Donnersmarck’s direction are impressive, with their still and restrained shots, penetrating scenes with a tight atmosphere. The Lives of Others, is an impressive debut from Donnersmarck, and though it’s major flaw is it’s length and loses it’s grip occasionally, The Lives of Others is still an important film to see, and should be seen."
"teh_mode","8","0","1","5 May 2007"," Superb political drama. Compelling, intriguing and emotionally engaging.
","Here's a film that achieves that most difficult of things: balancing the weight of its politics with genuine emotional engagement. The Lives Of Others never feels like a history lecture or political diatribe. We care for the characters first, and discuss the socio-political commentary post-viewing. Set amid the latter years of Communist East Germany, The Lives Of Others concerns playwright Georg Dreyman (Koch), a playwright who has attracted the irk of the Stasi, East Germany's main intelligence force. The grotesquely corrupt minister of culture (Thieme) places him and his actress-wife under secret surveillance for the GDR. The man sent to spy on the couple is lonely stasi officer Hauptmann Wiesler (Mühe). Pale-faced and relatively unassuming to look at, Wiesler always keeps his dullish grey jacket zipped up, his face never revealing more than a whisker of emotion, other than to the camera in moments of intimacy. His voyeurism of this couple leads him to become morally conflicted. He discovers vital information about them and their plans, but begins to doubt whether reporting it would best serve his own interests. Meanwhile, tensions grow between Georg and his wife Christa, who has to solicit the vile culture minister in order to remain immune from interrogation.<br/><br/>The Lives Of Others is a fascinating movie. Without the need for high-speed chases, a zillion edits or an exploding helicopter shot, it remains a thoroughly engaging, insightful and compelling experience. Ulrich Mühe delivers a remarkably underplayed performance as the stasi guard with a conscience, reminiscent of Gene Hackman's low-key surveillance freak Harry Caul in The Conversation (1974). He has steely-blue eyes that fool his companions into thinking he's bulletproof, but the truth couldn't be further from their grasp. You will come out of the screening with many issues to discuss, not least the film's insightful take on the high rate of suicide in 1980s East Germany, and it's relatively compassionate feel for its characters. Some may complain about portraying a stasi officer in such a compassionate light, but it works beautifully within the context of the tale. It may not break into the mainstream, but it is a fantastic debut feature."

","""Das Leben der Anderen"" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is a very good examination of the life circumstances in the former DDR. I'm very impressed by the acting in this film, mostly by Ulrich Mühe. He plays this stoic guy, a seemingly strong believer in the DDR-socialist system. We see his apartment, which is sparsely furnished. An exemplary citizen, who is working hard to protect the state against its enemies. And yet, by supervising all these artists, he gets a glimpse, that there might be something else to life than what he had learned. It also makes the fundamental problem of surveillance subject of discussion: It doesn't work, because who supervises the supervisors? And it also discusses the arbitrariness of the state leaders and makes universally applicable statements. Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch share a very interesting dialogue about the compromises you have to make in a system like this. Everyone has to make decisions. Who are we to judge if we don't see the big picture?"
"akkron","8","0","1","13 February 2007"," Population and secret political police in the last years of DDR
","""The life of others"" reminds me of another German film ""Last Five Days"" of Percy Adlon (1982) about an anti Nazi resistance of a group of German high school youth. Both films are characterized by a sombre, sober, thrifty manner of filming and playing (especially of Ulrich Mühe in the role of a secret service agent Wiesler). The main impression which it transfers is fragility, helplessness and defenselessness of a human person in the face of the cruel and merciless state repression machine. Nevertheless the man persists to resist. This sentiment which the film produces is the main reason of its attraction. It is easy to proof. Imagine that the entire film would consist of a narration of the dissidents' somewhat schoolboy's clandestinely, adventures and political declarations. Probably the auditory would have difficulty to stay till the end of that film. I have another association, on that subject, with a somewhat extraordinary film ""Funny games"" (1997) of another Germanic author, the Austrian Michael Haneke. In this case the shocking fascination of the film is produced by helplessness of a lonely human being in the face of a resolute aimless cruelty of some other persons."
