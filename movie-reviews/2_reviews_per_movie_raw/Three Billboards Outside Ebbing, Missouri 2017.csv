"tyson-hunsaker","9","390","536","4 December 2017"," A thought-provoking and darkly comedic drama with lots to say.
","""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" marks a milestone for writer/directer Martin McDonagh and is an idea piece on a mother's struggle with her town after posting billboards containing a call to action in regards to her murdered daughter. With outstanding screen writing and near perfect editing, this powerhouse of a film is easily one of the best all year and is driven with force and intensity by its lead, Frances McDormand.<br/><br/>What begins as a narrow and focused drama, gradually escalates to a film with big themes and ideas, relevant social commentary, and much more subplots than anticipated. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is packed with questions and a few answers about anger, revenge, violence, and kindness. The story shows people in a realistic light I've never quite seen before. We're presented with characters and their genuine emotions. Nothing feels sugarcoated of fluffed but it never lacks emotional impact either. <br/><br/>The movie balances its seemingly contradictory tones beautifully by crafting a dark comedy that feels heavy due to strong subject matter, while at the same time, utilizing comedic moments that feel completely natural to the character's motivations. It's obvious great care was taken into this script and the method in which it's constructed. <br/><br/>One of the most talked about elements to this film are the strong performances; particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. Rightfully so, this is some of their best (if not their best) work these eyes have beheld and they steal the show in every film they're in. That's not take away from Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges, as well as the entire cast who give memorable performances and paint shockingly believable characters that we feel we know personally. <br/><br/>If there is anything that might turn audiences away from this film, it might be its harsh subject matter despite none of it every being depicted as well as its language and execution with the material. Personally, this has a strong impact and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. It's a highly recommended film with a lot to ponder at the end and is definitely a contender for best movie of the year. Definitely don't miss this one."

","Frances McDormand is, without question, one of the very best actresses of hers or any generation. Wow! And like most of the greatest she goes for characters who don't ask for sympathy. The truth is in her eyes, always. So, naturally, I followed her every inch of the way. She is surrounded by a fantastic group of actors. Woody Harrelson is just extraordinary but perhaps the biggest surprise is Sam Rockwell making his one eighty not just believable but very moving. Martin McDonagh's writing is the magic potion that keeps everything together and when I say everything I mean everything. Humor and horror as if it were practically the same thing. The dialogue is brilliant and Frances McDorman deserves the last paragraph. Her face is a wonder. Superb performance. Don't miss it."
"Semisonic","9","201","283","17 February 2018"," Anger, what it begets, and what to do about it
","When you think about great cinema, you often imagine some grandiose epic setting which all that greatness builds upon. The likes of Gone With the Wind or Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption, such films span through decades or cover the major historic events.<br/><br/>But a great story isn't necessary grand on the outside. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is like a tiny rabbit hole size of those three wooden screens, but stick a head in - and you'll see a huge empty space laid with people's sorrow, guilt and regret. And that emptiness sucks you in and leaves no way to stay untouched.<br/><br/>But there's also hope. Hope for justice. Hope for retribution. And maybe even hope that it's still not too late to change something, or to change yourself. That nothing is absolutely black and white. That even in the darkest moments of our lives there's some room for a sense of humor, maybe a sad and bitter one but still one worth a warm smile.<br/><br/>This world is a crooked place, where crime often goes unpunished. And Peter Dinklage's small role in this film, as a reference to another not so pretty world where the ""happily ever after"" way doesn't quite exist, is a stinging reminder of that. TBOEM does not, however, try to pull the magic sword out of the stone and go crush the wicked and protect the righteous. Instead, it shows that sometimes, crumbling under the weight of the evil things that fall on us, we lose our own limits and become those who sow evil ourselves. Anger does beget even more anger.<br/><br/>And maybe the reason that makes America great indeed is that, with all the messed up stuff happening without and within, it's in your culture to value forgiveness, something Christianity teaches everyone but not everyone tends to listen. To suffer without guilt, yet to offer a helping hand to your offender when he's down and wounded. To break the circle of evil and help each other wake that yearning for decency that everyone has inside them, albeit dormant sometimes. Forgiveness is tough, and, just like revenge, it doesn't bring back the things - or people - we've lost. But at least it helps to hold onto what could still be here.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's just a movie, and most people aren't as deep and philosophical as the movie characters can afford to be. But if some unrealistic complexity (and sometimes even wisdom) of the simple people could make some real regular people on the other side of the screen stop and think over their own real regular ways, maybe that's exactly what we need from time to time. Because life is still here, and so are the multiple choices it gives, And which road to choose today, we can still decide along the way."
"FallonTimberlake2016","10","296","445","30 October 2017"," A comedic masterpiece with a stellar leading performance from Frances McDormand.
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.<br/><br/>Writer/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn't one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.<br/><br/>Basically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn't that bright and is more than a little racist. <br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that's coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. <br/><br/>For the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. <br/><br/>It seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you're laughing, it's easy to forget that jokes are being made.<br/><br/>Also, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a clichÃ© one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.<br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.<br/><br/>I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","229","351","18 September 2017"," A dark, twisted comedy about grief, tragedy and three billboards
","Having recently won the People's Choice Awards at TIFF, Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is very easy to see why it won.<br/><br/>Three Billboards is a dark but also funny and heart-felt story about one woman's quest to get justice for her daughter's rape and murder. After Mildred Haynes buys three billboards with words written on them accusing the town's well-liked sheriff of having not found her daughter's killer, it sets a series of events that turns the citizens and the cops against her.<br/><br/>The thing I can say about Three Billboards without going into spoilers is that it is wildly unpredictable. One moment you think things are going one direction as expected then it takes hard left turn that only adds to the dynamic between the characters. As the pressure within the town builds and anger is pointed towards Mildred, we see many of these characters evolve in order to deal with tragedy and grief and learn to find peace. And the movie goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. One moment you are laughing your butt off from the hilarious dialogue then you feel like someone just punched you in the gut. With every victory you think this story brings you feel like it was taken away from because of the world's unfairness and injustice. In lesser hands the mixture of dark and comedic tones would not work, but director and writer Martin McDonagh knows how to balance them to perfection.<br/><br/>The performances here just through the roof. Frances McDormand delivers a performance that will for sure get her into the Lead Actress awards race at the Oscars. As Mildred, McDormand just cuts loose with her performance with every line of hate, cynicism and cursing towards everyone she feels doesn't truly understand the internal pain she is going through. But McDormand does now and then show a soft side to Mildred. It shows that Mildred is just person like everyone who has her own way of dealing with the tragedy of loosing her own child. And Sam Rockwell also gives one of the best performances of his career as the flawed and very misguided cop Dixon. The character of Dixon is short-tempered, volatile, and not bright with some baggage of his own that the locals accuse him of. But Sam Rockwell brings his charm and sincerity to what could be a rather unlikable character. And in the latter half, you see Dixon go through a tremendous arc of learning to care about others rather then just being angry towards them. Other great performances that should be called out are Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawk and Caleb Landry Jones.<br/><br/>Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best movies this year and is worth seeing once it comes out in wide releases."
"blanche-2","8","156","240","7 December 2017"," Anger begets more anger
","Frances McDormand is a grieving mother who puts up ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" in this 2017 black comedy directed by Martin McDonagh.<br/><br/>Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is disgusted that the police haven't found her daughter's rapist and killer, so she takes out billboards asking why the chief of police, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) hasn't done anything about the case.<br/><br/>The billboards set off anger, violence, and revenge motifs in this small town. Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.<br/><br/>Lots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.<br/><br/>The one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.<br/><br/>Harrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.<br/><br/>And then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops."
"MongoLloyd","Null","280","456","28 December 2017"," Is this a masterpiece?
","Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? <br/><br/>Three giant billboards THAT close to the road and THAT close together - I've driven all over the country and never saw that. Billboards in rural areas tend to be smaller and definitely not that close together for obvious reasons. <br/><br/>WHO is this woman, Mildred? We know literally nothing about her beside the fact that her daughter was murdered. Eventually we find out she's divorced and has a son who lives with her, but if one is to care about the protagonist, character development is crucial. As it is, it's interesting to watch her do and say crazy stuff, but I couldn't care less about her.<br/><br/>WHY is it, two male characters directly related to the protagonist have a girlfriend & wife 20+ years their junior? Do they live in a part of the country where such a thing is commonplace? What are the odds of that? Probably about the same as if your dentist won the lottery but then your mailman did also. Yes, possible, but very, very odd and distracting.<br/><br/>Why does Willoughby's wife have an English accent? Was he in the military and met her while overseas? Is it common for a small town in Missouri to have British accented residents? If there was ANY character development, maybe we'd know these things. As it is, it's distracting and elicits questions that shouldn't have to be asked. <br/><br/>$5000/month for three previously forgotten about, decrepit billboards on a road people don't use anymore? LOL. For someone who is supposed to be a savvy, tough, non-nonsense older lady with the wisdom of the Buddha, that's pretty dumb.<br/><br/>A cop smashes office windows, assaults a man and throws him out a 2nd story window with no jail time. Really?! <br/><br/>Why does Willoughby have fatal cancer? Seems as no more than a cheap device used to heap more disdain on Mildred. Yawn. <br/><br/>Dixon ends up in the same hospital room as the man he assaulted? Is that supposed to be ironic? And again, what are the odds? <br/><br/>Mildred firebombs the police station, nearly kills a cop, and then just says ""I didn't do it"" and that's the end of it?! Really? <br/><br/>Some creepy stranger visits Mildred in her store and harasses her, THEN is overheard in a bar talking about committing a crime, maybe the crime in question, but alas even after Dixon cleverly retrieves dna from the guy, it turns out he's not even a local, and wasn't around when the crime occurred. Why then does the creepy guy know so much about the crime in question and WHY is he harassing Mildred!?!?!?! WHY?<br/><br/>Then to top off ALL that nonsense, Dixon and Mildred decide to go murder the creepy guy anyway, LOL, how profound."
"jbarrow-27014","6","251","421","3 December 2017"," Seriously overpraised
","The actors are superb, but the script fails in several ways. My immediate reaction, seeing the opening shots, was that this was not Missouri. I guessed it to be the southern Appalachians (where I have spent a lot of time), and so it was. The characters did not behave or speak the way real Southerners speak or behave. Martin McDonagh has written his fantasy of what he thinks Southerners are like. He got it wrong. He works in film sort of the way D. Trump works in politics--he shocks, he amuses, he appeals to our base instincts. But he doesn't tell a coherent story. <br/><br/>The central characters are not sympathetic, and indeed they are borderline sociopaths, including Frances McDormand's character. Sam Rockwell's ludicrous cop character would not be tolerated, even in small-town South. Viewers are left to wonder why Woody Harrelson's wife is a much younger luscious babe with a foreign accent. (Also a real Southern man, even a lout like Harrelson's character, would not use foul language in front of his two small daughters.) The period was not clear; observing the cars in the film it seemed to be the 1980s or 90s. Yet there were no computers seen in the police headquarters of the advertising company office. Yet near the end McDormand uses her cell phone. Other reviewers have noted the recurrent racism of the screenplay. <br/><br/>I kept wanting to get up and walk out, but stayed for a simple reason. As with any whodunnit, I wanted to find out who did it. Guess what? McDonagh never lets his audience know who did it. As author he must know, yet he keeps this information to himself."
"ramfat","4","313","530","16 February 2018"," The best way to express your grief is by committing multiple felonies.
","First, let's all just accept the premise that police beat up random black people for no reason whatsoever. Also, police are inept, because they can't find someone to arrest for the murder and rape of your daughter, even though there is zero forensic evidence. Next let's take a moment to reflect on the time you told your daughter ""I hope you get raped on the way too"". Now it's time to start lashing out at the world because you are angry. Start by committing 2 felonies against a dentist. It's also a good idea to go into a police station and tell them what horrible people they are. When your signs get set on fire, climb onto one of the burning signs and stand at the top of the flames. Next, fire-bomb a police station, because you are still mad, even though there is still no evidence or suspects. Finally, if you can't find the actual person who committed the crime, instead go murder a complete stranger on a hunch. This is all very profound and heart-wrenching...can't you tell by the music?<br/><br/>The police chief isn't so bad though, because he has cancer and is spitting up blood. He thinks it's best to leave the hospital, because what do doctors know about dealing with cancer. He doesn't want his wife and kid's final memories of him to be slowly dying in a hospital, so instead their final memories will be of him blowing his own brains out in the barn. <br/><br/>Thankfully, a streetwise black police chief came in to take over for the inept and racist white police officers. Now things will finally get done."
"chicagopoetry","7","326","556","25 November 2017"," Beware the p(l)ot holes near the billboards
","I will say that I enjoyed this film, mostly due to Frances McDormand's performance. It was surprisingly funny given its subject matter. But after thinking about it for a few days after watching it, I have to say a few words about the writing, because it seems everyone is raving about how ""Oscar worthy"" the writing here is, and at first glance, I thought so too. But thinking back on it, I'd have to say the writing is actually pretty sloppy. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and I mean a lot. I can't explain this without revealing spoilers, so be warned.<br/><br/>--Most strikingly the (deputy?) Chief Dixon violently attacks Welby, busts his face with his gun, throws him out of a window and proceeds to kick him while he's down, all in eyes view of the new Chief Abercrombie. Sure, he gets fired. But not arrested? Not even sued?<br/><br/>--And as for Abercrombie. He shows up the morning after the previous Police Chief died and declares that ""they"" sent him as a replacement. They who? Is there some force outside of Ebbing that dictates who their police chief is? That part really didn't make any sense to me. Also, replacing one of the main characters halfway through the film, a character we're starting to get to know, with a stereotype that we don't know anything about, was rather odd.<br/><br/>--Someone lights the billboards on fire. But apparently only the paper on them burns, not the old wood that's been sitting there decaying since the 80s, because they are able to paste duplicate posters to the existing structures without any problems. That's laughable. That old wood would have been a pile of smoldering cinder.<br/><br/>--Mildred is portrayed as such a tough-ass, assaulting a dentist, kicking children in the crotch (with no repercussions I might add), storming into the police station spouting vulgarities, but when she's confronted by a guy who suggests he's actually the one who killed her daughter, she freezes and seems helpless. One might say the fact that she didn't go psycho in this scene is what makes this screenplay original but someone else, like me, might argue that it's just out of her character and doesn't make a lick of sense.<br/><br/>--Chief Willoughby for some reason is an old geezer but has a young, attractive Australian wife. He also has two young girls. Yet he's completely vulgar around them. While instructing them about a game of fishing he invents, he calls the blanket they are sitting on the ""god-dam blanked""--twice--to little four or five year old girls. He says to his wife later that it's her turn to ""clean the horse *hit"" out of the barn. OK, I actually have quite a bit of experience tending horses. It's not called ""*hit"" it's called manure and you wouldn't even call it that--you'd just say ""clean the barn"" if you really owned horses. The writing of his character, other than the scene between him and McDormand while they were sitting on the swings, was actually horrible.<br/><br/>--Mildred burns the police station down, throwing 5 Molotov cocktails out of the still broken windows of the advertising agency across the street (not boarded up by then?). And the new Chief just accepts the explanation that she didn't do it because she was with James. No more investigation. Ho hum. Police station burned but oh well. And then a few scenes later, Dixon is apparently in the suppose to be burned down police station sitting there having a conversation with the new Chief.<br/><br/>--Dixon is a complete jerk to the bone. He gets a letter postmortem from the now deceased Chief. Suddenly he's a good guy. Yeah right.<br/><br/>I could go on and on with this but I'm afraid my word limit here is going to expire soon. I'll still give this film a 7 star rating because I DID enjoy watching it, but the writing here is really not all it's cracked up to be. It does feel like it's a big novel with a lot of twists, but in retrospect it's more like a parody of a big novel with a lot of twists, and the twists don't make a whole lot of sense."
"dirty_chords","4","265","451","12 February 2018"," Far from a great movie
","I can understand how one can adore this film. Of course it had some very interesting ideas and tried to make certain points, but in the end it was a tonally indecisive mess. Here are some of my main reservations:<br/><br/> - The script is overexplanatory and relies too much on coincidence, while it plays down the consequences the main characters would have in real life, when acting nuts. I dare you to go burn a police station down, remain at the scene (regardless of the fact that you are virtually the only suspect) and tell me what happens afterwards. Yes, I know McDonagh would have argued that we shouldn't take the movie at face value, but there are too many -and too important- plot holes to forgive (and this is not a buddy cop comedy for god's sake).<br/><br/> - In a cringeworthy flashback scene, we see the mother and daughter quarrel about Angela going out, only for them to prove their precognitive skills (Angela said she hoped she would get raped on the way, and Mildred agreed with her). Well, I'm positive there were more subtle ways to show why Mildred is filled with remorse.<br/><br/> - I thought Rockwell's character to be too cartoonish at times. McDonagh said that they had to cut a lot of material because there were tons of moments with Rockwell's character that were too comedic, but there are still many way over the top moments left in the movie.<br/><br/> - Willoughby is portrayed as a genuinely decent guy. Honestly, I don't get how can a Sheriff let his racist officers deal with black people the way they did and still qualify as a good person. Supposing he was an ignorant, illiterate redneck, I would be much more willing to excuse this kind of behaviour."
"rubenm","9","197","333","16 October 2017"," Extremely funny film about grief, anger, revenge and violence
","It seemed that the pregnant police detective Marge Gunderson from 'Fargo' would forever be the most memorable character of Frances McDormand's acting career. But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.<br/><br/>The part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.<br/><br/>Although the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.<br/><br/>Apart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.<br/><br/>And then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.<br/><br/>It is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."

","This movie is so obviously trying to be edgy & artsy, it might as well have had someone walking out with a sign at key moments- ""laugh here"" ""gasp here"" ""tear up here"". I love the actors, the characters were super colorful & the movie wasn't boring. Other than that, it felt like someone took a template of a dark comedy & then just left out the realism. <br/><br/>Going out on a limb here but I'd say people don't normally use the F word & C word that often. <br/><br/>Policemen don't act like that ...and still have a job. <br/><br/>Assault, arson or attempted murder are causes for arrest (even for cops)<br/><br/>People don't let their friends do jail time for the sake of leaving signs in the street (that was a friend, right?)<br/><br/>That 19 year old girl would not be attracted to the ex<br/><br/>Making fun dating a little person might have been funny 20 years ago (and then his enlightening 'look in the mirror' speech as he left the table was ... meh) <br/><br/>Also, that was quite a 180 for the vicious, racist cop who throws people out of windows. Too many unrealistic situations & reactions. <br/><br/>And why did that random suspect guy come into the shop in the first place?

"MarkAnder_","4","236","421","22 November 2017"," Confused film, nothing special
","The good: performances by Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell, and Lucas Hedges (despite not having much screen time.) There were some moments that were pretty cool and did some new things, but overall this film isn't worth much. <br/><br/>It is basically a string of mean people going along and doing mean things, to no end. Nobody learns anything, the little growth that does occur is quite forced, and a lot of it doesn't seem very grounded in reality. <br/><br/>The tone is confused, bouncing back and forth between Nickelodeon comedy and a dark drama, making it hard to take seriously. Woody Harrelson seemed to care so little about his voice-over work in the middle of the film, but that's understandable when the writers didn't seem to care much either. <br/><br/>The editing wasn't great and offered unclear communication at times. I don't know who picked Abbie Cornish for this, or anything, as she is an exceptionally poor actress. <br/><br/>I think we're supposed to be emphasizing with the main character, but that's hard to do when she's a callous wrecking ball. Making a film about a parent dealing with trauma of this nature is a great premise, but there's a certain humanity lacking. <br/><br/>I disconnected with this film when she didn't take the billboards down the moment her friend got arrested. I assumed it was a given- how could you let your friend rot away in jail while this futile ploy of yours is the single cause? And how was the friend OK with that upon being released? This is not a strong person, this is a petty and immature person who is seeking solace purely for selfish reasons. It is also completely overlooked that she is harming her still-alive son throughout the course of all this. <br/><br/>Finally, we have one scene with Mildred's daughter, who is the cause of all events that take place in the film. Not only was the actress incapable of carrying this scene, but it was also hard to believe she was the daughter of Mildred. <br/><br/>Overall, an unaware film that seemed to try to be catering to the current political climate."
"JoshuaMooreBE","9","79","136","15 February 2018"," Tense and unpredictable in every way.
","This movie I went into almost blind, but I came out of the theater with it probably being my favorite film in the last year. This film is so smart at being able to keep you at the edge of your seat from simple things that they plug into the film. Heartbreaking and tense situations in the first half of the film come back in some shape or form that leave you questioning what is going to happen. There was genuinely no predicting what the characters were going to do and how they would react to certain events. This unpredictability doesn't just apply to situations, but possibly more notable in character arcs. Without giving to much away, there is a character in this film that does everything possible for you to hate them in the first half, and by the end of the film you are rooting for said character. There's times where the characters that you cared for are becoming real and dis-likable in certain scenes, but to the point of more so being genuinely worried about how their choices will affect them.<br/><br/>Every actor in this film did so tremendous as well. I really can't think of an actor or actress that outshines the rest. But if I had to pick favorites, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were just that. But a lot of that just has to go into the writing of the characters themselves. The cinematography in this film allows the actors to take advantage of facial expression. There's a scene relatively early in the film that is mostly sitting and staring but the actors have such convincing movements and gestures, it goes to a point where you don't need dialogue to tell what they are feeling and what they are thinking about.<br/><br/>Really the only issue I have in this film is some scenes felt a little unnecessary. Can't give away too much without spoiling, but in a film where every character goes through in arc, there's one character that is just there to break tension and crack personally unfunny jokes. But this character did not affect my score and they were barely in the film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend checking this out."

","The drama of Martin McDon, known primarily for his ability to violate the foundations of modern drama, can easily be considered one of the best in the outgoing year.<br/><br/>In the center of the picture is the mother of the deceased girl, seeking justice and justice in a rather cynical manner and the unquenchable hope for which is the meaning of life, along with a single son and a worn blue overall.<br/><br/>""Where is the cliche?"" - I thought, and already on the 10th minute of the movie I stopped speculating about the development of events and trying to predict the replicas and actions of the characters. This unpredictable plot was not in my memory for a long time, considering that all the events taking place for nearly two hours (and there were an unlimited number of them) surprise with their surprise and sometimes absurdity.<br/><br/>The non-linear structure of the film makes the viewer systematically ask the question, ""What will be the end?"", But ""What will happen tomorrow?"". The same question is asked to themselves and all the characters: the divorced mother Mildred, who is already desperate to find justice, ultimately lives by today and actually loses the intelligible for herself and for the surrounding purpose, humiliating the policeman and accusing them of racism, sexism and other "" "". Sheriff Willoughby, who learned that he has cancer, does not know what will happen to his reputation after his death. The sheriff's widow does not know what will happen to her daughters. The assistant to the sheriff Dixon sits up his pants and reads comics, having no motivation, no prospects, nothing.<br/><br/>The appearance of three billboards in Ebbinge literally leads this small town into a rage. The hunt for Mildred is accompanied by violence on the screen, both from her side and from her ill-wishers (scenes in the dentist's office, as well as in the advertising firm). Even the church involved in the scandal gets gets on the forehead of Martin McDonagh, who calls her ""a criminal group"" and ""lovers of little boys, and in general, boys."" The whole town shows all the dirt, like a fish, rotten from head to tail, stinks of hypocrisy.<br/><br/>Thus, the unyielding willpower of the heroine Francis McDormand and her motivation, which at some point is questioned, makes the actress, perhaps, the main nominee for the Academy Award. And the abundance of all sorts of characters (including the hero of Sam Rockwell), well-designed, but sometimes fantastic scenario and satire on acute social problems (racism, sexual harassment, police lawlessness, etc.) make the Three Billboard reflect modern disgusting reality and valuable ( if not the most expensive) coin along with Bruges and the Seven Psychopaths in the treasury of the talented Martin McDonagh.<br/><br/>Bravo, McDonagh!"

","I wanted to see this film for several reasons; A) Not another Marvel superhero film, B) I love Sam Rockwell & Woody Harrelson & C) because of the Oscar nods it was getting.
I won't lie, it had a story line that I thought would have a few twists throughout and I found myself saying, it was him or he knows who its and is protecting them. I was wrong. Even when Dixon (Sam Rockwell) obtained the DNA from the man in the bar I thought there would be some kind of conclusion from that. Again, I was wrong.
Other reviews have stated how did Dixon get away with beating up the advertising guy or how did Mildred get to throw fire bombs at the police station and get away with it because a midget who fancied her said she was with him (This character had nothing else to do with the film and was not really given any role in the film other than to be mocked in the restaurant scene). Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) shoots himself and leaves letters that don't really serve any purpose to the film and his wife (Abbie Cornish) is so wooden and was that supposed to be an american accent as her native Australian came shining through.The ending showed two people who no-one but a sociopath could relate to going off to possibly kill someone who had committed no crime. I have to confess I did zone out for about 15 minutes but I doubt I missed anything note worthy to the sub standard plot. I'm at loss as to why it was labelled a dark comedy - I couldn't find anything remotely funny in this film. If you want a lesson in black comedy watch 'An American Werewolf in London'.
I was disappointed with everything the film offered - and it wasn't even filmed in Missouri.
Not worthy of an Oscar and not really worth the bother. Watch I,Tonya instead."

","As I watched this tripe questions kept going through my mind ""What were any of these actors thinking when they signed on?"", ""This was nominated for Best Picture?"" and ""Thousands of people gave this 10 stars?"" I guess the answer to these thoughts would be, they hate law enforcement, have no idea how middle america lives or thinks, and they lack anything resembling common sense. <br/><br/>These were awful caricatures not characters. None of this was believable and it lead to nothing. <br/><br/>Here's common sense left out of this garbage: <br/><br/>MOM: Has $5,000 a month to spend on 3 billboards. But, doesn't consider using it to hire a Private Investigator. <br/><br/>DIXON: A cop anytime after 1970. Not a chance. <br/><br/>WILLOUGBY: This is a small no nothing town, where's the real detectives to investigate a rape/murder?<br/><br/>ABERCROMBIE: Sees an officer throw a man out a window, and beat him in the middle of the street. Not only doesn't he stop the beating, he doesn't arrest the officer. He merely fires him. <br/><br/>RED WELBY: After being beat, thrown out a window and beat again, he doesn't press charges. <br/><br/>All of this seems outrageous and moronic, because it is. It's the worst script I've seen filmed in a very long time. <br/><br/>The real culprit is the screenwriter/director Martin McDonagh. I watched a few minutes of the special feature to see if there was some insight into this mess. 
It's said he was traveling through the US and saw a Billboard advertising a crime. What this moron didn't realize, it's what victim's family members and law enforcement do in hopes of getting information that lead to an arrest. This is done frequently, and there was a homicide in Florida where a handwriting sample was put on a billboard and a woman recognized it. The killer is now in prison. He couldn't even get the context these billboards are used correct. Of course he got nothing right with this waste of time."

Her performance was carried out competently enough, but the character was a cardboard cut out of an archetype that was stale in 1940, so... yeah, not sure how it beat the brilliance of both Margot Robbie and Saoirse Ronan.

","I wanted this movie to be great. It wasn't. The performance by Frances McDormand is good but not great. She's very good at showing overwhelming anger, but that's all she's allowed. Her character never gets the chance to breathe. Blame the script, not her--she's a terrific actor, but this is a one-note performance.<br/><br/>2. There is a sub-theme about race. Race is an important issue and deserves to be treated honestly, but in this movie, it felt like a side-road that led nowhere. (It actually feels like moral preening on the part of the scriptwriter. It didn't add much to the movie's meaning.<br/><br/>3. Wonderful performances by Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell as a police chief and officer. Woody especially brought grace to a character who at first seemed unsympathetic. (BTW, McDormand's ex-husband has a young and beautiful girlfriend, and that relationship is treated as awkward and shameful. Harrelson's wife is young and beautiful, and that relationship is treated as idyllic.) <br/><br/>4. Police officers don't talk like that among themselves or to others.<br/><br/>5. I particularly didn't like the Chief's take on racist cops, saying essentially that all cops are racist. That may be accepted as dogma by some Hollywood screenwriters, but any chief who talks about his beloved employees--or cops in general--like that shouldn't be a cop. Coming from this character, the sentiment is cheap and clunky and inexplicable.<br/><br/>6. There are a couple of plot holes wide enough to drive a billboard through sideways. The most egregious (no spoiler here) is what happens (actually what should have happened but didn't) immediately following the window scene. (You'll know the scene when you see it.) The thing not happening was necessary keep the plot going. Everything that happened after that feels tainted as artificial and contrived. Likewise a later scene in a bar, involving a coincidence beyond coincidence.<br/><br/>7. It's impossible McDormand's character wouldn't have been arrested several times in the course of the movie, for several serious crimes. Once again, he plot depends on that not happening, and thus the plot again is contrived.<br/><br/>8. There's a letter delivered to Rockwell's character late in the movie which is full of Hallmark Card sentimental drivel. It can't be justified by either what we know of that character or what we know of the writer.<br/><br/>In a world (as the movie trailers used to say) where we are awash in numbskull comic book movies and incoherent special effects spectacles, it was a small miracle this film even came to my local cinema. Too bad I couldn't love it."
"Turfseer","3","180","350","2 December 2017"," Overrated quirk-fest from playwright turned screenwriter, seeks redemption for vigilantes
","Combine the quirky characters of the master of quirk, Wes Anderson, and sensibility of adolescent wish fulfillment fantasy director Quentin Tarantino, and what do you end up with? The year's most overrated ""black comedy,"" Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. It's the work of playwright by trade, Martin McDonagh, who's been quoted as saying that he prefers writing for film over theater (why couldn't he stick with the stage if that's his primary area of expertise?).<br/><br/>McDonagh's strategy is to appeal to both liberals and conservatives but in the end he remains squarely in the liberal camp. He serves up absurd characters that appeal to the baser elements in our culture but infuses them with ""hearts of gold"" so they appear to straddle both liberal and reactionary fences, but actually exist in none.<br/><br/>Take for example his main character, Mildred Hayes (played by a haggard-looking, one-note Frances McDormand) who puts up the three billboards outside of town, frustrated by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his small town police department's inability to catch the man who murdered her daughter seven months earlier. The foul-mouthed Hayes functions outside the law and McDonagh throws a bone to reactionaries, asking us to approve of Hayes' desire for revenge and endorsement of vigilantism.<br/><br/>McDonagh's other rebel is Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a racist who tries to top Hayes in her quest to be the top-rated anti-social misfit in town. First he arrests Hayes' co- worker pal Denise on trumped up marijuana possession charges and after he learns of Sheriff Willoughby's suicide following the revelation of a cancer diagnosis, he goes after Red (the man responsible for renting the billboards to Hayes) and throws him out a second floor window (instead of arresting him, the new black police chief merely fires him! What's up with that?).<br/><br/>Just like Hayes, Dixon finds a scapegoat to assuage his guilt over Sheriff's Willoughby's death. When Hayes finds her billboards ablaze, she naturally pins the blame on Dixon and firebombs police headquarters. <br/><br/>It's at this point that McDonagh rather simplistically attempts to redeem his protagonists. The saintly, all- knowing Willoughby, in a letter he leaves for Dixon after his death, reassures the errant former officer that he's not such a bad guy after all, provided that he gives up his bigoted ways.<br/><br/>After Dixon survives the firebombing at the police station where he went to read Willoughby's letter, he decides to help Hayes after overhearing a potential suspect who might have killed her daughter. During a fight with the suspect in the bar, he manages to obtain the man's DNA. In an original plot twist, the DNA does not match and the potential murderer is ruled out as a suspect in Hayes' daughter's death.<br/><br/>With Hayes apologizing to Dixon for the firebombing of the police station (she escapes being charged aided by an alibi from a dwarf who lives in town), the two vigilantes make their way to Idaho to seek revenge on the now ruled out suspect in Hayes' daughter's death, as they are convinced he's guilty of other crimes of rape, and deserves punishment.<br/><br/>McDonagh, however, is uneasy with the idea that Hayes and Dixon would actually go through with their extra-judicial act-so he throws in a caveat. As they're talking to one another in the car, it's probably the unheard voice of the goodly Sheriff Willoughby which is still in the air. Hayes and Dixon express doubts about actually going through with the plan-the implication of course is that they will not engage in another act of violence-that they in fact have ""learned their lesson,"" and now are ready to act as law-abiding citizens.<br/><br/>It might be reassuring to a liberal audience that the bad guys suddenly become ""good""-that there is a measure of redemption for the two who have become unhinged by the deaths of people close to them. In reality, vigilantes remain vigilantes, and such reversals in outlook are highly unlikely. But even if one accepts the improbable Deus ex machina, McDonagh's willingness to excuse all the prior bad conduct, suggests a crack in the screenwriter's moral compass.<br/><br/>Ultimately, McDonagh wants his quirk-fest both ways. He revels in the bad acts of vigilantism, appealing to the aforementioned ""baser instincts""; but offers up redemption for his bad actors, in the form of a martyred lawman, who like a saint from above, offers words of wisdom for the ages."

","If it wasn't for the big names to carry this movie it wouldn't deserve a third of the critical praise it has received. I can't even fully describe to you, dear movie goer, where this movie is flawed. First of all, these characters in real life wouldn't talk like this. The vast majority of middle America doesn't curse this much in regular every day life. There isn't a lot of ppl that live in small town USA that walk around dropping a GD and an F in casual conversation at the dinner table talking to a priest, at the dentist office, sitting on a swing talking to a cop dying of cancer. That was the first major problem I have with the story. Like seriously WTF? The characters have no authenticity to them. And in a movie where character development is key, I found myself struggling for resolve. I mean the woman's daughter was raped and murdered for goodness sake. So that's major issue if you can't find something else in this woman's life to identify with. Furthermore, I can't help but wonder if making this a fictitious town was intentional or if the director actually wanted to use the town that they filmed in but city officials vetoed that once they heard the dialogue. Honestly you're better off watching an episode of Dateline and then following that with the Departed. Those 2 things make more sense than this movie."

He tortures a black kid, punches a young lady in the face, throws a city clerk out a two-story window for no reason at all. But yet, the writers thought that his character needed a redemption angle. Are you freakin kidding me?? His character belonged behind bars. <br/><br/>Aside from this, the script was just awful. People talking in ways that people just don't talk. Things thrown in there that didn't make sense. Why was this military veteran from Idaho, who had nothing to do with the girls murder, and who's never been to Ebbing before, just show up and start harassing a dead girls mother? Also, the characters in this movie do things that would ordinarily land a person in county jail, or even prison. But, they go completely unscathed. <br/><br/>But, lets not ignore the biggest goof of all, the wife of Woody Harrelsons character suddenly out of nowhere develops a British accent.<br/><br/>The producers must have spent some good money on fake reviews, because I can't see how so many film critics can find this movie to be great."

The billboards cause a lot of friction in the small town in southern Missouri where she lives. And around and around it swirls.... For nearly TWO HOURS!<br/><br/>Now here is the story that Hollywood really wants to tell you. Everyone who lives in small town Midwestern towns is dumb, alcoholic, and incredibly dysfunctional.

Because of the nonsensical plot twists, the inplausible and impossible coincidences and the flat out bad writing and bad acting this movie simply blew it.<br/><br/>Fails:<br/><br/>1 - Woody Harrelson's character explains to Frances McDormand's character in the first ten minutes that they have done everything in their power by cross referencing the DNA samples found with databases nationwide and that there were absolutely no leads. Therefore her persisting in keeping the billboards up just doesn't make sense...<br/><br/>2 - Why didn't the cops just deface/destroy the billboards from the beginning if they were so corrupt and didn't give a shit about the rule of law???<br/><br/>3 - The dentist who just happened to be one of the people complaining about the billboards insists on pulling out FM's tooth without even looking at it. She then proceeds to drill a hole through his thumb.<br/><br/>4 - Woody committing suicide. At that critical point in the film with the billboards and him showing only the first signs of even being sick. The guy is the chief of police and the entire town thought so highly of him. NO WAY he would just kill himself like that.<br/><br/>5 - The conversation Woody and his wife had on the couch was just way too dirty and bizarre and why all of a sudden was she speaking with a British accent???
This just completely through the film out of sync.<br/><br/>6 - The scene with the surviving daughter was just contrived and bad and made Frances just look like a horrible mother.<br/><br/>7 - The breakfast scene the next morning and her ex-husband overturning the table while the 19 y/o girlfriend looks on...<br/><br/>8 - Sam Rockwell smashing the front door, beating the advertiser, breaking the window, throwing him out the window, assaulting the secretary, and again beating the advertiser in plain sight of the soon new to be African American chief of police who does nothing. Rockwell is not arrested and sits at his desk while the film cuts to a news report about the chief's death and if the billboards may have contributed to his suicide.<br/><br/>9 - The news inferring that there may be a link to his death and the billboards paid for by FM's character. No news outlet would actually have said something like that for fear of being sued.<br/><br/>10 - The new chief of police taking his sweet time to enter the station and only after what appears to be half and hour or so dismisses Sam Rockwell from his job.<br/><br/>11 - Who the hell helped clean up all the broken glass and monitored the situation which was happening just outside the station then??? All the cops were inside the station as if NOTHING had happened.<br/><br/>12 - Some random guy coming into the gift shop to threaten FM's character, saying that he wished he could have been the one to rape her daughter. Ends up he was nowhere in the vicinity or even in the country when this happened. How does he know where to find FM? Why doesn't she chase him down or at least get his license plate number after he leaves. To top it off she's saved by the late sheriff's wife showing up to deliver a letter left by Woody.<br/><br/>13 - The billboards are burning down when FM and her son drive by and they conveniently have a 50 gallon fire extinguisher in the front seat..<br/><br/>14 - SR just happens to be in the police station when FM decides to firebomb the station from across the street. She tries to call the station to warn him to get out (Call trace???) But then just decides to set the station on fire with SR inside. Then conveniently Peter Dinklage's character just happens to be walking by and then becomes FM's alibi and then agrees to go on a date with him.<br/><br/>15 - FM & PD go on a date at the ""nice restaurant"" in town and her ex-husband and his 19 y/o girlfriend just happen to show up.<br/><br/>16 - SR is out of the hospital after maybe 24 hours after having ""severe burns"" and decides to go for a drink at the same exact time as FM's colleague who he had arrested & the billboard guy and to TOP it off the random guy who might have raped her daughter are all in the same bar. The random guy is bragging about having committed a rape just out of the blue when SR is sitting right next to him and then when SR goes outside, comes back, he finally asks if that guy has been sitting behind him the whole night... SR was like 6 inches away there is NO WAY he didn't know he wasn't there... Then all of a sudden when SR goes to the bar the guy acts like he has a big problem and they get into a big fight where SR decides to scratch the guy to obtain a DNA sample instead of simply calling the police and at the very most detaining the guy until the police arrive.<br/><br/>Probably one of the biggest stupid parts of the entire film. <br/><br/>Seriously 4 linked characters all randomly showing up at the bar. The guy admitting to a rape in public very well knowing someone is right behind him.

Violence creates violence, only forgiveness or the ability to leave things go can stop the circle: it is absolutely true, however we already know it.
The picture of the United States in a quiet small village is maybe too negative and exagerated, the total opposite of some american comedies in which everything seems perfect: here everything seems corrupted, violent, full of anger and hate, hypocritical.

","Boring and slow but I watched it in its entirety in the same way one morbidly looks at a bad highway accident because the movie is enlightening as to how low functioning, ignorant and racist Hollywood perceives the average person (you & me) to be. The police are portrayed as stupid to the point of mental retardation, openly committing violent & utterly pointless felonies in front of countless witnesses. They are inexplicably not held accountable for their actions. Likewise, when our almost equally ignorant hero firebombs a police station, the entire community knows she did it, and yet nothing comes from it. Such a crime would be an international news story that would mandate a major FBI investigation. The point is, this movie is completely detached from reality in every regard. Real people don't think or talk this way. People don't act this way. Reality dictates that there are unavoidable consequences for bad choices that don't apply in the fantasy world of this movie. Although this movie is not unique in this regard, I don't know that I have ever seen one so overtly contemptuous of common people. Ironic given the lack of education and real world experience that most of these Hollywood elitists actually have. Here is a tip for Hollywood on how to make real art instead of this garbage masquerading as art: in reality, the differences between the average person and the smug elites is negligible. A few bad choices for those without a safety net can create a life trajectory very difficult to recover from. Enough with the smug disrespect for customer base."
"willard12","6","42","77","14 February 2018"," Quirky, But Not In A Good Way
","I want to love this, as I get the main premise. However, there were a lot of quirks that just didn't fit. Things that didn't scan. Prime example was Sam Rockwell's character, office Dixon. It's like they tried to paint him as a one-dimensional, racist bad guy who redeems himself, but then add more layers that didn't really add/take away from him. Just filler for no reason. And what he does should have gotten him arrested not suspended. Unrealistic.<br/><br/>The dad was just dumb, but then they pull back on the throttle and he's okay. Then he's a dick again. I get that the writer/director is trying to add depth, but it just came out as confusion over the character and his motivations. Him saving the file was stupid. As stupid as her burning down the cop shop and him beating up the ad guy.<br/><br/>Honestly, I rooted for Mildred the least. I found her to be the least sympathetic character in the entire movie, and she was a mom who lost her daughter to a horrific crime. I get it, it changes you and a person who goes through that will never be the same, but damn. I found it almost impossible to root for her. And her little dumb conversations with her slippers and dear? Not cute or informative. Just dumb and it made the character look nuts.<br/><br/>I rooted for the sheriff the most. Here's a good cop who really wanted to solve the case and bring in the bad guy. Not for Mildred or himself, but because it was the right thing to do and it was his job. The dynamic of him having incurable cancer was interesting, and the one time I actually liked Mildred was during their interrogation scene when his cancer interrupts his smug ""gotcha"" speech. She's so awesome to him and he to her. The one true, shining moment of humanity in this. The movie would have been better served telling the story from the sheriff's point of view and ending with him.<br/><br/>6/10, but that's an aggregate. There were some real 1/10 and 10/10 moments."
"laweat","1","110","220","23 November 2017"," This is an uneven, disturbing mess
","I am completely baffled by the positive reaction to this movie. Comedy? No, sorry: grief, racism, cancer, suicide, rape, murder and assorted other antisocial behavior, not funny. The unintentional (?) irony of using a term like ""black comedy"" to describe this movie makes me throw up a little in my mouth. I am a huge Frances McDormand fan (and appreciate her performance here) so I'm very reluctant to infer that all this nastiness was intentional, but I don't know how to make sense of it. Intentional or not, it's repulsive and infuriating.<br/><br/>Just one example among many, but for me the straw that broke the camel's back: the racist cop unambiguously commits attempted murder of one character, who happens to be white, then cold cocks a female witness. (This last, shocking detail is apparently considered trivial by the writer/director of a movie whose PREMISE is the rape and murder of a woman, since it's never mentioned again.) The attempted murder is eye-witnessed by the new chief of police, who happens to be black. (So edgy!) Bizarrely, the racist cop is not arrested, though minutes later he's ordered to turn in his gun and badge. For what reason? The script is such a mess that it isn't even clear whether this is because of the attempted murder (absurdly inadequate) or for sassing the Chief (under the circumstances, ridiculous, and... what EXACTLY is the movie trying to say here?). The new Chief ignores/forgives/understands the attempted murder because the racist cop was upset? He thought firing him was more appropriate than arresting him and charging him? Oh, it's a COMEDY so we're not supposed to dwell on these kinds of details? <br/><br/>Hell no, that won't fly, not in America in 2017, where racist cops murdering innocent people because they're ""upset"" is no laughing matter at all. I'm almost as troubled by the awkward attempt at ""balance"" (I guess?) when Frances McDormand's character essentially commits an act of vigilante terrorism on the Police Station, almost killing someone in the process. The ridiculous ending made me think of Trump: there are fine people on both sides. Nope. I'm not having it. This movie is disturbing. Boycott this crap."

","Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) wrote and directed this very tough but brilliant story about anger, revenge, agony, prejudice - and redemption. Every character in this dramatic tour de force is drawn with equal parts hate and anger - with a dollop of hope and forgiveness and reconciliation in the end. It is a phenomenal achievement. <br/><br/>The language is saturated with foul/vulgar/trash type language but it fits the area and the particular character in this darkly comic drama. After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town's revered chief of police. When his second-in-command Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an immature mother's boy with a penchant for violence, gets involved, the battle between Mildred and Ebbing's law enforcement is only exacerbated. Mildred's son (Lucas Hedges) is seemingly the only stable character despite his absentee father (John Hawkes) and 19-year-old girlfriend (Samara Weaving) antics and his mother's foul pained mood. The pinnacle of angry young men is policeman Dixon (Sam Rockwell in a brilliant performance) whose movements include severely harming the sign maker (Caleb Landry Jones) as well as violating all manner of laws. Peter Dinklage portrays James, the 'town midget' whose role is also key to the denouement of the action.<br/><br/>Rape, murder, arson and many other forms of violence fill the screen but McDonagh makes it all make sense. McDormand, Rockwell, and Harelson are astonishingly but then there isn't a weak member in this extraordinary cast.

Rather it is an amalgam of extreme violence, course and foul language, misogyny and bigotry, all designed to push the envelope just a little further to satisfy an audience that apparently is no longer sustained by subtlety and a well constructed plot line. In a day and age when everything has to be ""in your face"" to gain attention, this movie delivers.

I think that there is a difference between paying homage to artists and downright imitating them.<br/><br/>The protagonist (who is played by Frances McDormand) is presented to us a likable person at first. But when she speaks to the police about her problems she seems quite nazi-esque. She wants to draw and test blood from every person who lives in her town to find a criminal. When the police chief informs her that such a thing is impossible because it would be a gross violation of people's civil rights, she doesn't care. He replies, ""he could have been a man who was just passing through the state."" ""Then let's take blood from everyone in the country."" Sure... She says it quite seriously. Repulsive.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson provides good acting, but there are multiple scenes in the movie when he does voice-over for comic relief that are mildly amusing at first but feel stale and forced rather quickly. There were many times when I just wanted to shut it off-- when someone is stretching irreverence out to the point of being unrealistic and absurd it's just bad writing. It's also bad form to have so much voice-over in any movie.<br/><br/>In the early going, Sam Rockwell's cop character is the type of person who would strike me as reprehensible yet tolerable. When he pistol whips an innocent man and woman then beats the man to within an inch of his life he goes from tolerable to I-want-this-moron-to-die. As other people have noted, the police chief (who witnessed all of these things in person) wouldn't just fire such a person. He would be arrested and convicted for attempted murder. Instead, the chief fires him in an almost nonchalant manner.<br/><br/>There is also an additional embarrassingly stupid scene in which Rockwell's character thinks that he is overhearing a violent criminal brag to his friend about his crimes. When the criminal confronts him... he scratches his face... then stares at him. Again, the Rockwell character is borderline retarded, but even the dumbest among us have a survival instinct. When I saw this scene play out I thought that it was part of a strategy or plan-- the Rockwell character wanted to get the guys arrested for assault so he could make his case to the police chief. Nope. Just more idiocy.<br/><br/>It has a few solid comedic moments. But I would never watch this film again."
"Danielpotato","2","45","86","28 February 2018"," The characters are too unrealistic and cartoonish to take this movie seriously. And this is the main problem of this movie.
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, should be a good movie, but the fact that the characters are too cartoonish and consequently these same characters become too unrealistic to be taken seriously. Of course Frances McDormand, did a good job as a violent mother. But Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson just did a nice job. Martin McDonagh is trying to impress the audience with fierce mannerisms, showing violence only by showing, and as a result he is trying to impress the male audience (audience is only interested in violence, instead of seeing a good story). In other words, the director was more interesting to create a movie full of violence, instead of creating a real drama with real characters and real and interesting conflicts, and an interesting film to see.<br/><br/>
So, in the end, this movie is your typical movie to please a certain group, in this case police haters (that is to say), many movies are in the top of the IMDb, only because in the same movies there are scenes in which the characters can deceive the police or there are scenes in which a large number of policemen are killed - the scene of the mother setting fire to the police station, in this film will be a future classic, in the minds of many people, mark my words.<br/><br/>We are not going to fool ourselves, a large number of the population hate the police and rightly so, many policemen abuse their position. But traumatized idiots, instead of getting over the traumas, they come here to give big scores to films like these, just to satisfy the vengeful wishes they have against the police.<br/><br/>If this is not enough, director Martin McDonagh only puts scenes of violence just to generate more violence, and with that these scenes become unnecessary violence scenes, scenes of the dentist and the mother hitting teenagers in the genital organs. A police officer throws a citizen from the window of a building, the police chief sees this and only fires him. Seriously.<br/><br/>What's the point of director Martin McDonagh? To prove that anger generates more anger, or violence generates more violence. At least he could put it in a more discreet way without the need for violent scenes. The effect he made was the opposite, because scenes of gratuitous violence only generate more violence in the streets. Amateur.<br/><br/>Even, the humor element becomes too obvious that borders the ridiculous, the scene in which a police officer, talks to the violent mother after the accident at the dentist. The scenes of black comedy border on the stupid and tasteless aspect and completely misplaced. The midget scene is completely misplaced too and overly obvious (putting a black comedy scene between before a dramatic scene, really!!). And of course, the annoying monologue of Frances McDormand's character with the deer, about reincarnation. Predictable and too obvious. Or dog-shaped slippers scene is obviously, also annoying to see.<br/><br/>
Not to mention that the movie script is full of ridiculous situations, bordering on the absurd. The mother in principle hates the police, because (stupid reason) is taking too long to find the culprit of rape and death of the daughter, then the mother becomes friends with a police officer, after she has seen that the same police officer (the same idiot, who throws a citizen from the window) risked his live to go get the paper process of the daughter in the back of the police station that was burning (fire put by the mother herself). Stupid and juvenile.<br/><br/>This is the typical movie that ends where it started. In the end, the culprit of the crime was not caught, the mother is still violent (the mother was always violent, just see in the flashbacks, the discussions she had with her daughter) and she embarks on a journey to go hunting down a ""supposed"" rapist, with the police officer than threw the man out the window. Idiot, I know.
I only give 2 stars, for the good performance of Frances McDormand, because she convinces me as a violent mother."
"d_m_s","4","10","15","12 November 2018"," Annoying, contrived, ludicrous, bizarre and ends like Episode 1 of a TV show.
","A summary to save reading the full review:
A film with many subplots and setups that go nowhere, so much so that at the end if felt like a pilot episode for a TV series. Contrived jokes, most of the characters are idiots and everyone is seemingly able to commit serious crimes and get away with it.<br/><br/>Brimming with unlikeable characters, the first hour of this film just annoyed me because it felt like every character was an idiot. Some were deliberate idiots (like Rockwell's character), some were accidental idiots - like Harrelson's character for example, who retained the racist, homophobic, unintelligent and aggressive, bullying Rockwell on his police force. Harrelson's character also commits an unexplainable act half way in. And no, his justifications did not make sense of it. It was, it seemed to me, a contrived effort to effect 'change' in the story and its characters. Tacky at best. Tsch!<br/><br/>There were many more idiots and many more idiotic behaviours from characters who otherwise seemed 'normal' up to that point. Like the kid of McDormand. How old was he? 17? In a rather ridiculous breakfast scene he gets milk and cereal all over his head and when his wife-beating father turns up he giggles like a schoolgirl and goes dashing out of the house like a puppy, with said detritus all over his head. Was this idiotic behaviour supposed to be funny? It's a rather contrived joke isn't it? But hang on, then when his dad turns a bit aggressive, puppy dog turns superhero, bounding like a ninja and deftly swiping a knife which he then places around his father's neck. Yeah, whatever. One second he's ""yay, yay, daddy"", the next he's got a knife against his neck.<br/><br/>This film is full of those contrived jokes ( as in the cereal-on-head one mentioned above). Rather pathetically and in what I would call a very low form of humour, several 'jokes' rely on idiotic behaviour by young women who are portrayed as being brainless imbeciles (""I learnt that phrase from a book I read about polio. Is it called polio? That game with horses?"") There are few young women in this film but they are all portrayed in this manner, i.e. they're morons. Has the writer/director got a problem with young women?<br/><br/>A film full of idiots is not necessarily a bad thing. I like Naked Gun. But put the idiots from Naked Gun into a 'serious' setting and it just doesn't work. The characters in this film aren't likeable or realistic idiots, they are either just vile or behave stupidly for comedy value. And that's pretty low brow humour. What you end up with is a bizarre mix of the serious and the stupid and it just doesn't work. Yes you can have black humour in serious films. Sometimes it can be unsettling, sometimes it can bring much needed tension relief. But in this film the comedy element is off and it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I found the first hour of the film unbearable. The last 45 minutes improved BUT only because it seemed like it was finally going somewhere and then...it didn't. Subplots came and went, as did characters who at first seemed significant then do little after a key scene (for example, the new Sheriff who replaces Woody Harrelson. He comes in bold as brass, kicks a few asses, gives you the impression things are about to happen in the film and then he practically disappears for the rest of it, popping up here and there in minor scenes!)<br/><br/>Also annoying was the ludicrous ability for all characters to commit serious crimes and yet not get arrested. Rockwell beats up a guy and throws him out of a first-story window onto a main road, in broad daylight and directly opposite the police station AND observed by the new Sheriff. McDormand torches the police station and beats up high school kids. Her ex-husband burns down the billboards referred to in the title. No one gets done for anything. It's daft.<br/><br/>At the end I really felt like I'd just watched a pilot episode to a TV show (one where most of the characters are unlikeable imbeciles and everyone is above the law BTW). It set up many things to be explored and then didn't explore them.<br/><br/>Weird."
"gregbader","3","10","15","30 March 2018"," Highly Overrated
","I had a suspicion this movie wouldn't be that good whenI saw the opening scene that was supposed to be set in Missouri, when there were mountains in the background of a height that don't exist there. I waited until the end of the credits, and discovered that the movie was filmed in the Great Smoky mountains of North Carolina. That's a pet peeve of mine: movies where the locale is essential, or at least important, to the plot, but where they're shot hundreds of miles away, usually because of nice tax write offs for filming in a certain state or country.<br/><br/> I can sum up this piece of crap with: 
it contains the foulest language I've ever seen in a movie - - language that was not just unnecessary, but absurd in terms of how people talk to each other; the plot is so improbable so as to be laughable; the acting was any thing but good, except for Woody Harrelson's. Hollywood liked the movie because it took swings at white, small-town America and its citizens - - read Trump voters. Don't go see--or don't rent or buy-- this piece of junk if you haven't already."
"Fella_shibby","10","31","57","23 February 2018"," Awesome film. Very entertaining inspite of the matter being serious n dark. The mamma's boy deserves an Oscar.
","Saw this in a theatre. Very entertaining film with relevant social issues. The film deserves best film Oscar n Rockwell best supporting actor.
The best part about this film is the character development and the awesome ensemble cast and their performances. 
Frances McDormands performance is solid but Sam Rockwell cannot be ignored n Woody Harrelson is always a treat to watch.
Another great aspect is the writing. McDonagh did a terrific job. He tackled the films serious dark material very well n made the film bearable to watch by adding enuff humor, unpredictability, tension n beautiful locations. The editing n cinematography is good too. This film was captivating n mesmerising n not at all slow as compared to most Oscar nominated films.
Havnt seen the directors previous films but will definitely check it out as after watchin this film i can b sure of em being good."
"thesuspenseisterrible","1","126","266","21 November 2017"," Awful from beginning to end
","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I hated this shockingly racist, illogical, trashy film! I am stunned that it is not being called out for the racism (hidden behind the mask of alleged liberal good-deed-doing) and violence that it condones! I have never seen a film make so many attempts at virtue signaling while at the same time exhibiting racism all over the place. Frances McDormand alleges about some torturing of ""innocent black folks"" and yet that storyline is never explored. Sam Rockwell (so awful in this I need to invent a new word to describe the failure) plays a racist cop but we never actually SEE any racism - there is only innuendo and excessive, unfunny use of the ""n"" word. Racism, if you're going to explore it intelligently with an audience, needs more than mean words and one scene where a ""racist cop"" get annoyed with and threatens to take in a young hipster black man for spitting in the cops direction. Sadly, that's the best example of something mildly racist actually happening in the film besides cheap talk - and it's WEAK - because frankly the cop, dumb as he is, actually has a point in that spitting towards a cop is an act of aggression - the cop didn't arrest him, he just reminded the young man that he's walking a fine line. Every black character (all in minor roles) portrayed seems to have stepped off the train from Williamsburg or Wicker Park. They are ALL hipster types with nothing of value to contribute besides cheap talk. The black people in this movie exist only to make the fake liberals look good for having ""black friends"" somewhere in the background. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION - WHY is Frances McDormand the star of this film? Why not ANGELA BASSETT? Instead of casting a white actress why didn't the filmmakers decide to make this story about a Midwestern black woman who's daughter's rape and murder was ignored by the cops? That would at least be a more believable attempt to explore these themes - rather than FILTER THAT MESSAGE through a white woman. Hollywood is racist and they almost always think white liberals need to save black people. Is it about racism, or justice for the dead daughter? Neither, ultimately. As for her dead daughter, she's abandoned by the storytellers so...WHO CARES? <br/><br/>The violence is stupid and LOOKS FAKE! Example: that dumb kitchen scene with the boy and his dad and the knife! Embarrassingly executed - almost as embarrassing as that REALLY bad CGI DEER that is just a knockoff scene from a superior scene from THE QUEEN. ALSO --the message of anger begets anger, etc being explained to us directly from a character is cheap writing and disingenuous. There is no good message here. Also, why the making fun of the midget? Gee - that hasn't been done thousands of times! Stupid. Not funny and NOT edgy. <br/><br/>BASIC PLOT FAILS! <br/><br/>#1. They introduce a man who ""MAY"" be the killer Frances is kinda searching for (more time is spent kicking high school kids in the shin - by the way, why did those kids just STAND there and let her keep kicking them? Not a very realistic reaction. They would have RUN AWAY!) He MAY be the killer - and then we learn he definitely is not? And why give us this whole story about him being somewhere ""SANDY"" in the war? So he's a rapist soldier now instead? So WHY show him CONFESS to Frances earlier? STUPID!<br/><br/>#2. THE BILLBOARDS DON'T WORK! We see NO ONE drive past them EVER except for Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody. As for the news broadcast, that was again cheap writing. It doesn't show us how people react to anything related to the billboards. Woody's cancer is a cheap diversion from the fact that the billboards have no affect. By tying his cancer so directly to the plot with the billboard's ""alleged fiasco"" they deny the opportunity for the audience to see the townsfolk real reaction to the CONTENT of the billboards - and instead they react to Frances being mean to a dying man. This defeats the point of the billboards in terms of storytelling, so it's hard to see any real reason why or how these billboards EVER stir the pot, but the filmmakers pretend that magically they do! <br/><br/># 3. When a hipster gets thrown out the window by Sam Rockwell - the new police chief sees this - and, uh, DOES NOT ARREST HIM! So, not only do the filmmakers know nothing about police, what is legal or illegal, but they have never watched a single episode of LAW AND ORDER or even JUDGE JUDY. Speaking of reactions - no one in this film has a realistic reaction to anything that happens ever. Sam Rockwell goes from nearly murdering someone, to acting goofy after getting fired, all in the same breath! It's stupid beyond belief. Then we're supposed to believe that during THE FIRE, just SECONDS AFTER reading Woody's moralistic letter (another cheap devise overused throughout), he has an instantaneous change of heart/moral epiphany and thinks immediately of saving the BURNING CASE FILE ON HIS DESK to help Frances McDormand? I could go on for hours about how awful every second of this film is...save yourselves the time. Watch ""IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT"" or ""MISSISSIPPI BURNING"". <br/><br/>This movie is so awful it does not even deserve to be criticized. The only reason I am is because it has gotten rave reviews from critics DESPERATELY searching for a zeitgeist film of the moment, but who haven't found a good one yet so they are propping this one up! WHY? Because it checks off all the correct virtue signaling requirements of the times. Critical thinking while viewing this film will reveal a false justification for violence, bigotry towards dwarfs and country people, and inherently racist storytelling."

This ""film"" did prompt a few walkouts with them returning shortly to resume, during the intensely vulgar scenes.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the classic films that are peppered with language and some vulgarities, such as Quentin Tarantino's earlier films. But with this ""film"" with such a long and bizarre title that lends to the mystery, it's long on vulgar ramblings for desperate attempt at cleverness and short on subtleties.<br/><br/>Do not bother to see this ""film,"" simply because it's nothing new and revelationary, regardless of acting ensemble and sort-of originality, except essentially aping Coen brothers' theme and style. All that it does is pull some shock humor with vulgar phrasings and some violence for dramatic effects, with a rather lame and tense-less climax that definitely rips off Coen brothers' style by ending it on the abrupt note.<br/><br/>If this ""film"" wins Best Screenplay Oscar, then it should prove that the voters have no taste, that prove them to be as much of a vulgarian as the vintage-Tarantino-wannabe director, who should stick to playwriting rather than make aggravatingly stupider ""films"" trying to be clever that overemphasizes absolute vulgarity with even less meaning and more irritation, with absolute no point to comprehend. <br/><br/>A definitely overrated tripe, courtesy of the dishonest critics that pushed the rating on Rotten Tomatoes for nothing but a farcically pompous and vulgar piece that only test the limit of the audience's tolerance for perfect vulgarity that demonstrate the filmmaking body to be the irrelevant and deplorable.<br/><br/>* 1/2"

","After hearing a lot of praise and having been fond of the cast, I thought this would be a slam dunk for me, but I left disappointed. I will keep this review concise and sweet.<br/><br/>The acting is above average and the main players especially have solid roles that they make the most of. Unfortunately,one of the main problems to me was the sheer loathsomeness of every character, McDormand's included. I'm all for dark comedies, gritty film making and art that explores the dark side of life, but the interactions that the characters have in this film are downright unpleasant. One scene after another. There is also a heavy racist undertone in the film, as well as stereotypes of southern life, crooked cops and racist hillbillies. The few black characters in the movie are portrayed as straight laced and well adjusted, at times saviors, while the crazy deranged white folks engage in all kinds of derelict behavior. 6/10"

","Martin McDonagh is an exceptional writer - I will never forget seeing ""Beauty Queen of Leenane"" on Broadway many years ago. So it is not surprising that this film has some compelling characters and scenes to go along with its intriguing premise. However, it is surprising how RIDICULOUS everything else seems to be. As Wesley Morris pointed out in the NYT a while back, there's nothing ""real"" about Ebbing. At all. It is an ultra-unrealistic blend of Hollywood's many non-existent US small towns. And the cast of characters being drawn together there makes zero sense. Just like the wardrobe and the inexplicable choices and the way the characters talk to each other. Basically, it is kind of a mess. the cartoonish nature of it all makes caring pretty tough, despite some great performances. There's a lot of promise here (and even some comedy), but very little of it pays off."

","First have to give this film some credit. Especially Frances McDormand as leading actress. As a general story maybe it wasn't bad for this American moment. But gotta stop there. <br/><br/>As someone who grew up in Missouri, Ugh. Hard to swallow. Full of grotesque sterotypes and gratuitous violence. I couldn't figure out why it didn't feel at all like Missouri to me. Then saw that they filmed it in North Carolina near Asheville! Just gave everyone southern accents and affects, not necessarily Missouri accents, made every man but the advertiser a violent jerk. Everyone says fuck every third word. Not quite like the Missouri I know full of walmarts and fallen buildings and churches (NOT catholic). It is a billboard itself, one of east and west coast projections of the midwest. <br/><br/>The mother of Oliver had some authenticity, but the ""people of color"" were completely and utterly urban and out of place. There are no restaurants with white tablecloths and wine in my town or anywhere near. What I guess bothers me about it is that there are so, so many projections on the American midwest now that no one really cares to go and see...you know what is really there. Even if they make a movie about the place they don't go three states away to film it there?! And that just doesn't feel right. Where is the picture of that very active grief?

","Lately, when many people see Awards being dished out to movies they begin to think twice about their worth, in much the same way as when advertisers spend up BIG to tell us their latest product is the BEST on the market - you can often expect a cop-out. With Francis McDormand heading up the cast you might expect the Cohen Bros may have been somewhere in the wings to push it along - in fact, this work offers many of the depressing earmarks of some lesser Cohen productions (maybe that's partly why the Academy selected it?) The overly sensationalistic mix contains all the ingredients that one could cram into a plot filled with a continuous succession of near impossible coincidences (not to mention some perverse PC agenda pushing) With little or no character development and too many stretched situations - we are taken through a series of shocking actions that would land anyone committing just half of them, in jail or would have the local community after the perpetuator's blood! - but no, our 'hero 'Francis violently assaults school kids, dentists, and near anyone she feels like with few saying little more than boo. And for those who attempt to excuse this as ""black humour"" - the 'humour' is just so 'simplistically' dark as to be virtually invisible.<br/><br/>The local police (an unconvincing bunch of simplistic stereotypes) bash people near to death in broad daylight, and this is all taken as just another day in a town where every inhabitant tends to be on the edge of a mental meltdown. There's almost no-one the viewer can emotionally identify with or support - unless they too, are on the loopy side of Mental Health Denial. Add to the above, a lazy writer determined to create a swear fest - where all the foulest of outright mean language is paraded - in an attempt to out-shock any that's gone before. This is juvenile trendiness in the extreme.<br/><br/>Viewers bright enough to see beyond a manipulative piece of exploitation - may see this rather pretentiously overrated concoction for what it is. While it attracted a lot of people to the ticket box, it's obvious from the Huge amount of viewer feedback - published on IMDb, etc; many of these audiences were bitterly disappointed and would like both their time and money back.

","Sorry. This movie has a lot going for it. Excellent acting, sharp dialogues, great music, and nice visuals. It also has an interesting premise and deals with important social issues such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and so on. It is thought provoking and moving, which is why I am wasting my time writing this review - because this movie's plot is so poorly constructed that it makes a random episode of ""Elementary"" look like a piece of high art. I'm going to spoil the hell out of it. Be warned.<br/><br/>First, while I can understand why a mother, mad with grief and blaming herself about the rape and murder of her daughter, would put these billboards up, I can't see the reason she would keep them up. She made the police her enemy. Nobody in Ebbing (this name is really funny in my language, by the way) supported her, except her best friend. Her son was bullied in school because of these billboards. Her son was crying to her that he didn't want them to remind him of his sister's horrifying death every day of his life. Why would she keep wrecking his life, and why would she keep ruining her own life? Plus, sorry, but she was a cashier in a gift shop. This, as far as I'm aware, is not a terribly well paid job. Why would she waste five thousand dollars a month on something that only brings her more grief? She had a living kid to take care of, after all, and one would think that supporting her son would be more important to her than flipping the police off.<br/><br/>Then there are the real problems. OK, I know this movie isn't supposed to be realistic, and I know it is not a detective mystery, but, dammit, the writer/director should have approached the copious amount of criminal activity he showed on screen more carefully. Maybe he wanted to show how corrupt and/or inept the policemen in small Southern cities were. I don't know, and, frankly, I don't care - because there is no way in hell that a police officer, while on duty, will single-handedly destroy an advertising agency, beat the living snot out of its owner, and assault his secretary, and get away with it, especially if he does it in front of dozens of witnesses, one of them - his new chief. At the very least, the people he beat would press charges. There is no way that a woman, grieving or not, will go to a school yard and beat a few kids up and get away with it. There is no way that the same woman will burn the police department down and get away with it, especially after the person who has provided her with an alibi yells in a crowded restaurant that she did it. There is no way that a former police officer will confess (in the same restaurant, in the same freaking scene) that he has committed arson and get away with it. And so on. None of these crimes was properly investigated. None of them led to arresting anyone. (And there were more crimes where the result was the same.) Was that supposed to be a part of the message?<br/><br/>Then there are the absolutely unrealistic situations, like the flashback where the daughter said she hoped she'd get raped and the mother said she had the same hopes. Or the scene where two men entered a bar, sat less than a foot away from a person they didn't know, and started a casual conversation during which one of them bragged about raping a girl to death. Or the scene where two parents left their little girls unattended by a lake and went to the woods to make love and get drunk. Or the scene where the father, after giving his kids one last happy day, went to the stables and shot himself in the head, because he wanted his kids to remember this happy day. And so on. This movie is filled with forced situations that, thanks to the (admittedly, great) acting, somehow work, but at the moment you start thinking about them, you realize that they are forced, unrealistic, and stupid.<br/><br/>All in all, I wanted and expected more. Sorry. (My next review will be more positive, I promise. I need to break this string of negativity.)"

","Warning. This review contains plenty of spoilers but I don't think this movie is worth watching.<br/><br/>I ended up really disappointed with the movie. This is basically a crazy art house movie that they give away as a drama. And you won't find it out until the very end. Every character in this movie is flawed or corrupted in one way or another. The chief of police got cancer, Dixon is a racist violent policeman and stupid mama's boy, and yeah his mother is a stupid heavy drunk, Mildred's ex-husband dates some, you can guess, mentally challenged 18-year-old girl, there is a midget who wants to date Mildred. This is the language of the movie, ""fat dentist and a woman with a funny eye"". And yeah the victim was set on fire and was raped while dying. And yeah there is a suspect who commited the same crime, but who appeared to have done that somewhere in Iraq. In the end Dixon also got burnt to look even uglier. So this is basically some art house movie material, they take all the dirt existing, they create and bring even more dirt, but they wrap it up in some good-looking quality drama package. God damn. <br/><br/>But the worst part is the ending. Basically, the idea of the movie is that we live in a stupid violent world, there is no redemption, there is no justice, there is no afterlife. All the people are stupid and flawed, all social institutions are corrupted. But Mildred tried to bring some justice by putting these 3 damn billboards. However, they corrupt and perverse her in the end as well. Cause she is going to kill that rapist, ""not her rapist"" but still definitely a rapist. And there will be little drama even in that. She and Dixon are not really sure if they wanna do that but they will find out as it goes. Wait, what? What is this movie about again then? They bring the idea that ""anger begets even greater anger"", chief of polce Willoughby asks Dixon to be kinder and all they gonna do in the end is killing some rapist? Cause people are innately not capable of some more ""productive"" behavior?<br/><br/>In the end there is no reason to watch this movie. It's a quality film and producing but that's all there is to it. They take A VERY SENSITIVE MATERIAL but only to PLAY AND FOOL AROUND WITH IT. They produce cycle of violence and idiocracy but with no real purpose. And they give it away as some drama. They abuse viewer's trust and waste viewer's time. It's really sad that they manage to confuse everything and everybody so much that this pile of trash of a movie got so many positive reviews and we are entertained with such macabre nonsense."

","Even Frances McDormand's academy award winning performance can't save this film. Yes, McDormand is excellent, but even great actors can't save a story/script this poor. Good movies perform magic, while ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" performs a street-hustle trick with a loaded deck of cards. The film drops names of important and timely issues and simply glosses over them, trading substance for melodramatic violence, constant foul language, characters that are mostly caricatures, and a story/script with close to zero continuity and coherence. The film is billed as a dark comedy, but it really is a dark nightmare of a film. Honestly, I've read comic books with a more coherent storyline. There are various incidents of assault, arson, and attempted murder AND not only is no one ever held responsible, but the incidents are forgotten five minutes later in the film! ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is good at shocking the audience at times, but not much else. A huge waste of both good acting talent and your time and energy."
"russellalancampbell","3","14","23","30 January 2018"," Too many barking cats! And I hoped to like the film.
","I rarely go to the movies anymore but the film's location, the hype and Frances McDormand brought me out. I was ultimately disappointed with the experience. It seemed that the screenplay's conceit - the three billboards - was seen as such a good idea and selling point that the writer/director, Martin McDonagh, couldn't resist it even though it was beyond him to make anything coherent or believable around it. Moreover, he saw the location of small town Missouri as an opportunity to satisfy the world's base expectation of racism, violence and small-mindedness without the slightest intention or perhaps ability to explore them. McDonagh cut and pasted disparate scenes together in what was to add up to a black comedy and drama but the danger of going for art is that, when you miss, you get irksome, unentertaining, unconvincing dross. Films like ""Fargo"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Good Fellas"" and even ""Apocalypse Now"" are examples of how a roller coaster, collage screenplay can work but it takes skill to make it a unified satisfying whole. 
 
What went wrong? Screenwriting. Some of the dialogue was clichÃ©d and amateurish. Many of the jokes were telegraphed and some of the emotional outpourings hollow. Characters. Whilst the ""head"" of the film McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell did well, the gut of the film's cast were given nothing to work with and became pieces of cardboard. For example, how did an English rose (Yes, I know Abbie Cornish is Australian but she seems to effect a British accent) with an education in literature meet and marry a sheriff from small town Missouri? It can happen but there is no rhyme or reason for it within the context of the film. Moreover, some of the actions were uncharacteristic of the established characters. How does a mother and responsible loving father who is a chief of police leave their two little girls fishing by a lake surrounded by wilderness in order to have sex in the woods? The wife's praise of her husband's ""cock"" on their return home seemed gratuitous and phoney. The aftermath of making love with your dying husband was never so lacking in tenderness or affection. If you want sweetness without too much sugar in a black comedy look at the final scene in ""Fargo"". With a bit more imagination, McDonagh could surely have written a more touching family scene to symbolize a perfect last day for the sheriff prior to shooting himself. The suicide scene itself was apparently supposed to shock us with its suddenness but it seemed to me be just another obvious and convenient plot point. The letter of explanation by Chief of Police Willoughby for his suicide was utterly unconvincing too. And not to be too facetious or insensitive but I hope to look as well as Woody did and to be able to have sex right up to my end too! You may accuse me of being picky but, for the sake of brevity, I am only pointing out a few of the many cats that barked in this film. Smash up an advertising business, savagely beat up its editor and throw him out a window and brutally assault a female assistant but all that happens to you is you lose your job as a cop! I also found the punch in the face for the nice girl utterly gratuitous, cheap and nasty. Was it not established that Dixon was violently angry by what he did to ""Red""? No restraint and definitely no imagination by the writer/director. <br/><br/>I could also point out the rather uninspired soundtrack and the lack of atmosphere. Nothing about the film spoke to me of a time and a place except perhaps for some of the posters in the dead girl's room (Nirvana) and the girl's punk/grunge outfit in the flashback scene. Even the original ads on the billboards from ""20 years ago"" looked more like the 1950's or 60's. <br/><br/>I often judge a film by the strength of my impulse to see it again. Good ones get even better the second or third times around. Nothing would convince me to believe that I would find ""Three Billboards"" any more or less interesting or entertaining than it was today for me. If this is a classic, I will not be venturing to the movies very much more in future"

The scope of your cinema experience explains the gushing that is involved in this absolute mess of a movie. Is it a comedy, dark comedy, drama. This Martin McDonagh guy doesn't know. It's everything. First off Frances McDormand is at her weakest ever. Her performance, isn't a performance because she was born to play this. Anyone remember ""Olive Kitteridge""? No? Then you are the idiots who need to watch more movies, because this one is in the basement compared to others in its ilk.<br/><br/>Let's recap this movie for the people who ""loved it"" -Mildred Hayes rents three billboards to antagonize chief of police to continue to investigate the murder of her daughter, whose last words to her was ""I hope you get raped too."" Is this funny? Music didn't tell you that. -Mildred retains a relationship with her ex-husband who is STILL physically abusive. In a bizarre scene...she is lifted off her feet by the throat while the son breaks up the fight by putting a knife under the throat of his father. Then within seconds, they reset and act as if nothing happened. This was seriously in the movie. -Her ex-husband is dating what looks to be a supermodel. When he is some small town hick. Really? Only in a movie can you force this. -Sam Rockwell's character Deputy Dixon lives with his mother and is a dumb brutish bigoted sidekick to Woody Harrelson's chief Willoughby. They both stumble on violations or things that seem like violations. Trust me, this explanation is funnier than the execution. -In a small town where a teenage girl was raped and burned alive, Willoughby and wife leave their children to fish as they go off to have sex (seriously).<br/><br/>Anyway, you get the point.

The cops are racists, black people are oppressed, little people are demeaned, innocent people are beaten without consequence and another is arrested and jailed for two joints - in 2017, while arson and wife beating are winked at by seemingly oblivious yokels. All of this is seemingly in service to director McDonagh's seeming belief that small-town America is most clearly defined by its defects and those defects are rampant pathologies. If that's true, he doesn't prove it with glib mockery and snide derision masked as social commentary.

In my opinion, ratings that high are reserved for movies like Forrest Gump, Titanic, Shawshank and Good Fellas so I really went into this with high expectations. This movie did proceed along quickly with enough twists and humor to keep you interested but it is so far fetched that it becomes stupid. The police are portrayed like characters from The Dukes of Hazzard so you just roll your eyes every time they talk. Then they get away with criminal acts with no recourse much like detectives in Lethal Weapon. Shoot your gun, kill people, break the law.....do what you want, after all, you're the police....right? This is truly a 4 star movie. You may not hate watching it but it is in no way a must see. As mentioned in many reviews the acting by Frances and Woody is very, very good and you can't help but love the resolve of the main character who is willing to stand up for what she is trying to accomplish as well as the pain Woody is going through in his life. But again, you just can't ignore the foolish scenes that occur. Ever seen a western where a guy shoots his gun 45 times without reloading? Or better yet a movie where the hero shoots 6 times and kills 6 bad guys all who had automatic weapons and were firing back at him.....Need a fire extinguisher?....Her's a 50 gallon one in the front seat of my car. It's those kind of occurrences that happen throughout the movie that make you say ""oh come on"" about 7-8 times throughout the movie.

","""Anger begets greater anger."" says Penelope (Samara Weaving), Mildred's (Frances McDormand) ex-husband's totally non stereotypical nineteen year old new girlfriend, who delivers the film's theme in what is supposed to be another comedic moment where we are all supposed to laugh at this beautiful but shallow girl's attempt at sounding smart, and yet, it falls flat, like the vast majority of both dramatic and comedic moments.<br/><br/>I just want to clarify before going any further that In Bruges, Martin McDonagh's directorial debut, is one of my absolute favorite films. One that navigates comedy and drama perfectly, brilliantly written and acted, I could go on for days on how perfect In Bruges is, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Sadly, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri fails miserably where In Bruges succeeded. It constantly tries to navigate the difficult line between dark comedy and drama, and mostly, it falls flat on its head.<br/><br/>The thematic thread may be to blame here. Without spoiling the plot, the setup is simple: Frances McDormand wants some form of justice for her daughter's brutal murder. She gets the local police department's attention by setting up three billboards complaining about their inability to solve the case. But her action only generates more conflict in town and while it does draw attention to her daughter's case, it leads to increasing tension between her and pretty much everyone else around her. Her anger literally begets more anger and, ultimately, solves nothing.<br/><br/>This is a surprisingly simple moralistic viewpoint coming from the man whose first film was so morally complex and ambiguous and it results in the creation of equally shallow characters and a plot that desperately tries to make sense of its many pointless turns.<br/><br/>To be fair, McDonagh attempts to humanize its more prominent characters: Mildred (McDormand), in spite of being a tough and wooden most of the time, shows deep vulnerability in an unfortunately insufferably cheesy monologue she gives to a deer. Meanwhile, Dixon (Sam Rockwell), the ""black torturer,"" displays humanity later in the movie and tries really hard to find redemption when he is shown the way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately those attempts are so sudden and awkward or poorly executed that they lack believability and feel like they were artificially implemented to make these characters seem deeper than they really are.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, it feels like the filmmaker is more interested in hammering his simplistic viewpoint and using small town America as a perfect setting for it - even though it never feels like he has actually ever spent time there - than to craft a story with a coherent through line and inhabited by humane, relatable characters.<br/><br/>There was so much talent involved in the making of this film - and in spite of everything, Sam Rockwell delivers a stellar performance - that it is truly frustrating that the end result be so mediocre. Hopefully, McDonagh will course correct on his next film."

But everything in the evolution of the story was contrived.<br/><br/>None of the relationships were genuine except maybe the police Chief and his family, but even then there was a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The lead character was in mourning, so I get that her behavior might not be normal, but her behavior was horrible and without any real consequences to her, only to others. Maybe that's life, but everything was framed as though she should be applauded for treating other people horribly.<br/><br/>It felt like every event in the film was done to be opposite what you might expect in a film. I would normally be happy that it isn't so formulaic, but it actually was formulaic because it took the formula and quite predictably did the opposite. It got to the point where the writing was just horribly pretentious.<br/><br/>I almost gave it more stars because the acting was good, but I just couldn't do it. By the end, you feel like you've wasted your time and feel frustrated watching this movie commit cinema crime instead of solving the crime in the story.<br/><br/>This movie tried to force emotions and force genuine situations, but it failed miserably."
"ariarostami","1","57","119","1 December 2017"," For those that hated the film and are petrified by these good reviews
","The whole way through I realized that this film isn't full of racist characters, the film is just racist. The way the man that was pasting up the billboards spoke to the cop who ""tortured people of color"" (what was that scene all about BTW?) - was completely tone deaf to how Black people have to interact with the police, especially overtly racist ones! It just seemed a masturbatory way for the writer/director to create a false reality where he can exercise his white-guilt about cops torturing Black people. That same character comes up later with the replacement billboards like some magical hero who was ""always on the right side"" (because Black people hate cops I guess?) that only exists to be a servant to Mildred. Her friend in the store, Denise, is only there as a tool for the audience/Mildred to be angry at the cops but has absolutely no depth herself. And the new Chief is, again, only an extension of the writer's enormous White guilt. For such a racist White town, that doesn't seemed to be bothered about a cop that tortures Black people, it seems that no one is bothered by a new Black Chief - who has come to no protest by the people and conveniently fixes racism within the police force by firing the one racist. (Woody Harrelson's line about if you fired every racist cop you'd just have three that hated fags is an insane apologist stance too.) In fact, this new chief is such a ""good guy,"" (I hate to say it because it's so gross, but what a classic example of an Uncle Tom) that he forgives and overlooks Mildred who blew up a police station and attempted to murder someone. These character's Blackness only exists to serve Mildred, it's flimsy and exploitative. Also, that monologue about the Catholic church is nauseating - she defends a racist law created to throw as many Black people in prison as possible and relates it to child molestation in the church (also, throws in homosexuality as an equivalent to pedophilia) which is supposed to be a ""you-go-girl"" moment but ultimately you can't side with her because the priest is the only character in the film that was there for the son. I read a quote from the writer/director that Mildred is an antihero which may explain that last scene but... what the f***? Your protagonist is a woman demanding that the police find the man that raped and murdered her daughter and decided that she is going to be an antihero???? She's not liked by the town for being zealous and she's not liked by the audience for everything else... It takes sharp turns from comedy to drama, cutting both aspects short at the wrong times with none of the humor in the antihero aspect - it's an excuse to have a woman in a revenge role to say that it's a film with a woman in a revenge role... taking notes from the Coen Brothers, Tarantino, Ritchie, and Twin Peaks but missing all of those marks by miles. Not a single female character, not one, had any depth. The ex-husband's new girlfriend for one, was a cartoon based on women being complete morons. Almost all the characters had some sense of being real people but then they throw in a character as comedic relief and the joke is ""women are horrendously stupid."" Even Mildred is a one note story, she's an angry, bitter mother. Her character arch was completely neutered to fulfill the character arch of the antagonist, a racist who read a letter and is all better now. The second half of the film is just a way to apologize for officer Dixon's wrong-doings - some White male guilt fantasy that he can be redeemed of all of his sins if you just gave the poor guy a chance. That's who the story serves in the end, it IS NOT ABOUT a grieving mother that wants answers, it's not about a child getting raped and murdered, those are just points added in to ultimately give redemption to the wrong doings of white men in power and absolve the writer/director of whatever sins of his own I'm sure he's working through in this film. I even read a quote that he was happy this film was being released among the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment wave as this film is a place for that anger... wow. Also... The Dwarf character was just used as the butt of what felt like 100 jokes and his redemption is some after school special line about ""you judge me for looking different, but look at you"" - that character is an adult, why is he consistently trying to date Mildred and cover for her? (hint: to make the audience feel better about laughing at endless midget jokes when he gets the final word.) Then the rapist who murdered someone in some ""Sandy country"" (-_-) is drawn as simple as some of the women in this film. I guess the writer/director is claiming that - it's not war that brings out the worst in people - some people rape and kill and brag about it to their buddies over a drink with no signs of PTSD, shame, guilt. PTSD would not justify rape and murder, but it is an extension of ""people can do good if they just changed their minds"" that we saw with Officer Dixon. (Maybe there will be a sequel where the rapist says he's sorry and spends the rest of the film teaching Black kids how to play basketball. Seems like a fit continuation for this confused film.) Too many false endings too with no real good conclusion other than, again, to serve as a nice pillow for the redemption of officer Dixon to rest on. Would've been better if the climax was the Chief's suicide and the resolution was that he gave the money to Mildred."
"nehpetstephen","2","16","28","9 January 2018"," Seriously? What do people see in this?
","There have been plenty of times when I've been annoyed by what was presumed to be the frontrunner at the Oscars and the Golden Globes. So often, the movie that wins Best Picture and sweeps the other categories is something that I consider overrated or cheesy or simply not as good as some of the other movies I enjoyed from that year. In all of those cases, I can at least put aside my frustration and disappointment and understand what it is about the movie that's connecting with other people, or I can appreciate why it was entertaining or moving to audiences even if it wasn't quite my thing. In all the years I've been paying attention to movies, not once has a movie like this come along--a critical darling, an awards frontrunner, a box office smash, and an IMDb user hit that I find to be thoroughly awful nearly to the point of offensiveness. My friends who have seen the movie feel similarly. I honestly cannot discern a single reason for why this movie is being lauded.<br/><br/>What's astounding about this fact is that I actually love most of the people in the cast. Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Lucas Hedges, Caleb Landry Jones, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Clarke Peters--these actors are phenomenal in almost every other thing I've ever seen them in. In this movie, they do the best with what's been given them--and Harrelson and Landry Jones almost even come out on top--but the lines they've been given to read are so artificial and inhuman, the situations they've been put into are so false and baffling, that it's impossible to imagine that any of these characters are existing in any kind of stable reality.<br/><br/>And look, it's not like I need overly naturalistic realism in all my movies. In Bruges, also by McDonagh, took place in a bizarre, surrealistic kind of universe, but at least its weirdness seemed consistent and self-contained. It established a convincing over-the-top world and then allowed a clever story to unfold within it. I didn't enjoy Seven Psychopaths nearly as much--in fact, I found its meta story to be quite pretentious and not nearly as intelligent as it thought it was--but at least that movie, too, seemed to be playing by its own established rules. What are the rules of Ebbing, Missouri? Is it supposed to have any intersection with the America I live in? Or is it supposed to be absurdist through and through, simply an excuse for unbelievable violence and offensive punchlines? <br/><br/>Because it doesn't seem that way. It seems like McDonagh wants us to believe that this movie has a lot to say about what really matters in America. It so frequently mentions things like racism, police brutality, domestic abuse, and sexual assault that it seems like surely it must have something to say about these issues. But instead, it might as well just be posting hashtags across the bottom of the screen. It has as much to do with female empowerment and combating racism as a typical round of Cards Against Humanity.<br/><br/>In the early scenes of the movie, I found myself wondering if it was supposed to be set in the mid-nineties. The way characters tossed around words like re**ded and n****r seemed dated and backwards, yet the apparent self-consciousness with which they used these words made it seem like it was taking place in the present day. Bad writing, I thought, like when a period picture uses a word like ""nerd"" twenty years before it was even coined. But then I realized that this was supposed to be the present day. So why do the characters sound so bizarrely out of place and time? Is it because McDonagh thinks all people from middle America are backwards and ignorant? When Rockwell and McDormand argue about ""n****r torturing"" vs. ""people of color torturing,"" what the hell is the punchline there? What's the satirical target? Who's the intended audience? Is it supposed to be intelligent elites who understand identity politics and enjoy laughing at the clumsiness of people who aren't quite up to speed? I just don't see why this scene exists or what it's supposed to evoke from me, especially when it seems ultimately irrelevant to the plot of the movie.<br/><br/>Is it really necessary for the movie to so casually evoke police brutality and torture? There's not really a single meaningful non-white character in the entire movie, and the trajectories of the plot and the character development don't really have anything to do with that. Is simply mentioning it sufficient to feel as though something is being done about it? One of the most well-directed scenes in the movie is when Rockwell sends an innocent, unarmed man to the hospital while in uniform in broad daylight on a crowded main street. But the immediate aftermath of this horrifying moment is that we follow this character and we're supposed to root for him and appreciate his decency even though he's done practically nothing to deserve such empathy. Look, I'm not opposed to anti-heroes or to trying to understand and forgive the prejudices of racists. My entire family is full of racists, many of whom I love. But this screenplay doesn't put any real work into doing anything meaningful whatsoever with this character. Rockwell's character is a cartoon--far more bumbling and stupid and unaware than the many actual racist people I've known in my life. His actions are likewise far more dangerous and reckless than the actions of anyone I've known in my life. And yet by the end of the movie he's essentially taken center stage as the protagonist and hero.<br/><br/>Is that the point of the movie? What message are we supposed to get from McDormand, who barks a bunch of curse words that I guess are supposed to be hilarious because they're coming from the mouth of a middle aged woman? When Dinklage's character humbly shames her for friendzoning him and not smiling enough--is that the moral of the story? Is her assault on two random, presumably innocent teenagers supposed to be rousing? Are we supposed to applaud her fascist vigilantism, a la Dirty Harry, or are we supposed to be critical of the violent cycle of revenge that she's initiating, or are we just supposed to shut off our critical faculties completely and enjoy the flashiness and the silliness and the midgets and explosions?<br/><br/>Ultimately, that seems to be McDonagh's point--to make a trashy bit of popcorn. And yet because he happens to drop a few resonant keywords like ""people of color"" and ""patriarchy,"" audiences seem to be convinced that something really insightful is unfolding before them. The slightest pause of consideration produces a thousand nagging questions, however. For instance, why would McDormand's character be so willing to knee-punch teenagers, yet cower whenever a man comes to her admitting to be her daughter's murderer? Why would the town priest let her ramble on for two pages of insulting, nonsensical monologue? Wouldn't he interrupt her or just get up and leave? Even the part of the movie that evoked one of the only laughs from me doesn't actually make any sense. Sure it's funny that Sheriff Willoughby was the secret savior who paid for the second month of McDormand's unrealistically expensive billboards, but if he's really planning on killing himself and leaving behind a young wife and two young children, would he really be throwing away five thousand dollars like that? I'd be pretty furious if I were his wife.<br/><br/>I don't mind popcorn. I don't mind violence in movies. I thoroughly enjoyed John Wick Chapter 2 despite being opposed to gun violence. But John Wick Chapter 2 never preached to me about the most pertinent issues of contemporary American life using nothing but bluster and empty catch phrases, and as far as I know, no audience member thought that such bluster was topically relevant and deeply moving. So why do people think Three Billboards is anything other than curse words and cartoon violence?"
"GlassBall","4","8","12","16 April 2018"," Three Flaws with Ebbing, Missouri
","Director Martin McDonagh has impressed beyond measure in the past. ""In Bruges"" is a film that perfectly blends the dark, the hilarious, the perverse, and the utterly, utterly depressing.<br/><br/>Going into ""Three Billboards"" I had high expectations, and I don't know if that coloured my final opinion or not, but all in all, I found it to be lukewarm at best. While there were impressive aspects of the film such as some beautiful shots, outstanding acting from Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage, and many, many of the side characters, and brilliant writing, at its core ""Three Billboards"" is missing something which can be summarised in three points.<br/><br/>1. The Daughter<br/><br/>The core conflict of ""Three Billboards"" is that of Frances McDormand standing against the negligent police of Ebbing. The conflict is rooted in their inability to solve the rape and murder of her daughter. From the get go you are behind McDormand. There is no two ways about it. However, I found the impact of her plight diminished greatly as the film went on and on. Two moments that define that. One: The sole flashback to her and the daughter fighting, and Two: The death of Chief Willoughby. By only having one flashback I found it hard to connect with how important this fight was to McDormand. We didn't see her with her daughter, it's almost as though her daughter wasn't relevant and it was more of a criticism of negligent police in America. The death of Willoughby stalled the conflict in a major way in that when McDormand and Willoughby were in the same room, it felt like a battle between superpowers. The man who caused all this pain, and the woman who can't stand the pain anymore. They had chemistry, intensity, and both were understandable in their stances. Once Willoughby died, McDormand was forced to direct her anger onto Sam Rockwell's character, who did not have the same impact on the plot as Willoughby. His story was compelling all on its own. To put it simply, the conflict was dampened by a lack of context and the killing off of a core character with whom the tension was most palpable.<br/><br/>2: It got lost<br/><br/>As previously mentioned Willoughby's death ended the most compelling conflict in the film. From that moment on, it becomes less about McDormand's daughter and her retribution, and more about how McDormand is affecting the town itself, which would be fine if the first act had framed it that way. All throughout the first act McDormand's struggle is at the forefront, she fights for justice and it's compelling, you feel her pain, you understand her. Once it turns to throwing molotovs and dating Peter Dinklage I can't help but feel that the direction of everything act 1 set up is tossed out the window (pun intended). Other characters are placed in the spotlight and because of that, McDormand's story is lost and we're left with what feels like an elongated episode of ""Three Billboards: The Series"". <br/><br/>3: The CGI Deer<br/><br/>This isn't a big complaint, but that deer killed that entire scene. The Ring 2 somehow managed to have CGI deer that were more tangible than that bizarre effect.<br/><br/>3: McDormand and her character<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is a brilliant actress. There's a reason she is so well respected, admired, and placed on the pedestal that she stands on. As a person, I admire her, and her speech after receiving Best Actress was one that will be remembered.
All that said, her performance in ""Three Billboards"" was one of the most stale, unmoving, uninteresting performances I have seen. A stern glare can only work in so many scenes before it loses its shine, and ""Three Billboards"" had too many of those scenes. Her character's motivation was simple, and it's easy to get behind, but by the end of the film, her character has not changed. She is still the same stone faced woman that stared down the advertising salesman at the start of the film. Her story has not progressed, she has not gained or lost anything over the course of the film. Her actions appear to have no consequences in relation to her. Her billboards are set alight, but before long they're put back up. She can't pay for the billboards, so someone else pays for them. She throws molotov cocktails at the police station and she serves no time. Her actions have no tangible consequences and that only works to her detriment.<br/><br/>""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" could have been so much better. Aside from the three aspects I discussed above, I enjoyed what the film had to do. Caleb Landry Jones was wonderful as the advertising salesman and his arc in relation to Sam Rockwell's character was one of my favourite things in the film. Peter Dinklage was one of the funniest characters in the entire film. McDormand's ex-husband and his new girlfriend had some brilliant scenes, both dark and comic which started to come close to what ""In Bruges"" had done, it just never reached those heights and was dragged down by questionable choices in storytelling and character development.<br/><br/>4/10"
"Shambala_Elephant","3","8","12","19 March 2018"," Indulgent, Afraid of Sentimentality
","The talented cast and occasional idyllic images of rural Missouri, not to mention Renee Fleming's beautiful rendition of ""Last Rose of Summer,"" can't save this indulgent movie. I know: the whole point is to mock violence, indulge violence, and comment on our obsession with violence while implying the need for justice. But a movie has to be willing to take a stance, risk sentimentality, and risk being moral if it wants to be successful-if it wants to be more than artful and ""original."" Over-the-top violence is never funny to my sensibility, and I think it says more about our collective inability to solve our mass shooting problem and pervasive social-psychological disconnection (preferring social media to real intimacy) than it does the movie's sophistication. When police chief Sam Rockwell knocks the kid off the roof and then goes down to the street to kick him into the hospital, camera's viewpoint where his gun would be holstered, it's disgusting, pointless, and not at all funny to this viewer. That they meet later in the hospital is supposed to function as some kind of double irony and edgy rapprochement, but it's simply exhausting. And that tired device--hideousness as humor, gratuitousness as art-is getting very tired. <br/><br/>I'm reminded of the popular movie ""Sideways"" (2004)--no likeable characters, no one I'd like to spend time with, no one I admire. And yet the popular consensus in that case, as in this one, said the movie was so hilarious and that it was true on some level, or so true that it was hilarious. In truth, the joke was on us in that we found losers funny because we saw ourselves in them. Truth in ""Three Billboards"" would have been the Francis McDormand character, Mildred, getting out of the car instead of agreeing to travel with Sam to Idaho to act out their vengeance against the sociopath who, it turns out, didn't commit the rape of her daughter. Clearly, he's not a good guy, and the movie could have meditated on that more meaningfully, instead of turning him into yet another wrongfully accused but rightly unappealing character, righteous now that he has been brutally attacked for something he didn't do. I know: the movie leaves the outcome of their own private Idaho ambiguous. They set off together, but some of their drive for revenge has dissipated. But in this movie, no two people talk to each other in any meaningful way, for that wouldn't be artful. How much more compelling the ending would be if she got out of the car, for example, and walked home. (It's also not very plausible that all the parallels between the war vet and the actual killer are merely coincidental, but that's part of the movie's pretense to high art, its subverting of a cliché--Shane overhearing the Ryker brothers in the darkened saloon.)<br/><br/>The only decent character is the new chief, the black officer come to replace Dixon (Sam Rockwell) for his incompetence and inability to channel or heal his rage. The message here seems to be PC--all white people in the movie are rotten, horribly flawed, at the very least limited. The man in the white hat is black. That's a nice twist on an old cliché, but the social commentary is about as subtle as, well, renting three billboards to send a message to law enforcement to find a daughter's rapist/murderer. For God's sake (don't worry; I'm an atheist), don't be so afraid of a true character arc, one that offers the viewer a different lens, something better than: the white hoi polloi are all, as a class, backwater brutes. In the end, what else can an enraged mother (who was herself abusive) do? She can have a change of heart. Or she can find and confront her daughter's killer. But that's too prosaic for this too-cool-for-school best picture nominee."

"claudio_carvalho","7","33","65","10 January 2018"," Deceptive Ending Without a Conclusion
","""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a great crime movie in an environment of grief, anger, remorse, racism, violence, sympathy and a sophisticated black-humor. The performances are top-notch and it is hard to point out only one or two names in the cast, indeed a constellation of stars. Maybe the performances of Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell may be highlighted since they are the lead. Unfortunatelly the deceptive ending without a conclusion throws cold water in this film. The redemption of Dixon finding the rapist killer would have given some hope to the story. But the author decided to keep a dark ending without conclusion. Claude Chabrol was a master in mystery films with open end; however his conclusion were subtle and ambiguous, giving the chance to the audience to discuss possibilities based on his or her interpretation of the storyline. But the conclusion of ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is indeed a cliffhanger usually used in TV series or films written for franchise or at least a sequence. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Três Anúncios Para um Crime"" (""Three Billboards for a Crime"")"

I couldn't figure out why it didn't feel at all like Missouri to me. Then saw that they filmed it in North Carolina neare Asheville! Didn't even bother to travel two states over to give it the real feel. Just gave everyone southern accents and affects, not necessarily Missouri accents, made every man but the advertiser a violent jerk. Everyone says fuck every third word. Not quite like the Missouri I know full of walmarts and fallen buildings and churches (NOT catholic). The mother of Woody had some authenticity. The ""people of color"" were sophisticates, completely and utterly urban and out of place. The wife of the sherrif had...a British accents?! Really? FYI...authenticity alert...there are no restaurants with white tablecloths and wine in my town or anywhere near if you don't go to college towns or cities. <br/><br/>What I guess bothers me about it is that there are so, so many projections on the American midwest now that no one really cares to go and see...you know what is really there. Even if they make a movie about the place they don't go! Missouri is a fiction here. One of male violence, racism and western vigilanteism. And that just doesn't feel right.

","I should have looked to see who the writer and director of this was before watching. Had I known that ""In Bruges"" wrote and directed this as well, I might have avoided it, or at least gone in with no expectations. Perhaps then I would also have been less surpristed by the weird feel of the characters which is explained by the writer's ignorance of the sort of people he is trying to portray. The overall concept of the film is good, but almost every element of it is poorly executed. I'm somewhat puzzled that none of the actors, especially Frances McDormand did not review their dialogue and protest that their characters were stilted and not quite right, kind of like Invasion of the Body Snatchers imitations of real people. Overall, it was a waste of an extraordinary ensemble cast, especially the principals, McDormand and Rockwell who each do a very good job with the material they were given, but also a waste of Peter Dinklage who seemed to be there just to be the midget, and Clarke Peters who had basically nothing to do. I'm not a prude for language, but the use of it in this movie reminded me of the anecdote about Mark Twain responding to his wife's attempt to shame him with a stream of vulgarity, saying, ""You have the notes, but you just ain't got the music."" The violence was completely out of kilter also because the director never adequately set a tone to the movie. Was the violence supposed to be comic, and that is why nobody gets arrested, or was it supposed to be realistic and the characters in the show are really that stupid? It's impossible to understand during the course of the film. One starts out very much wanting to be sympathetic with McDormand's character and then, in desperation with any character in the movie, but to no avail. Each of the main characters turn out to be execrable, unsympathetic people with no consistent human pathos. The final ""villain"" character is nothing more than a tremendous plot hole so deep and dense that he is a veritable black hole that sucks all suspension of disbelief down into an alternate universe, leaving one wishing that another choice of movie had been made.<br/><br/>I give it three stars because the actors all acted and the images made it to film okay.

","This is one of the most poorly written, produced, directed, acted, edited films I've seen all year. It's all entirely incoherent with 0 logic put into it. From characters to story, everything is done completely wrong. The directing is very bad. You won't see anything more pretentious than the shots and color grading of Three Billboards all year. It's a lot of slow pans, hand-held, and shots of billboards that has no significant meaning. The lighting is also very unnatural too. There is a super pretentious deer scene that supposedly represents incarnation? What does that symbolic metaphor supposed to represent if her daughter is dead? UGGHHHHH. The music is absolutely horrible. It's this typical Coen Brothers esque music. Actually the entire film feels like a Coen Brothers rip off. There is also this obnoxious Southern music that will fill your mind with toxic. The characters and the story represents a Southern country. Another movie glorifying these obnoxious conservative Trump tards. The more we support these vagrant trash, the more the world will suck. Three Billboards is one of those cynical depressing movies that doesn't help anyone. ""OH LIFE IS SO DEPRESSING, LOOK THE COPS DON'T HELP FIND THE RAPIST AND WE MAY NEVER FIND THE RAPIST SO LETS GO DO SOMETHING IMMORAL OR KILL OURSELVES."" Seriously? The message is so bad in this film that it doesn't even make sense. The acting is some of the worst I've seen all year. No one is good in this movie and the characters are just down right awful. All of these characters have problems and they are so unlikable that you just don't care for them. They also make absolutely 0 sense. So, Frances McDormand is supposed to be this strong female character, but she is dependent on the cops catching her criminal? SHE ENDS UP GOING AFTER A RAPIST THAT ISN'T HER RAPIST, SO WHY DIDN'T SHE DO THAT WITH HER RAPIST IN THE FIRST PLACE? Oh yeah, to even add more heat to that ending. Apparently Sam Rockwell knows where that rapist lives just by getting his car plate number and the blood from him beating him? He's not a cop anymore, so why is he able to get confidential information that he shouldn't have access to? OKKAAAAYYY that makes no sense. Sam Rockwell becomes from a racist cop to good cop for some reason because he read a letter from his dead chief. Why? He despised his chief in the first half, so that right there is a plot hole. The editing is absolutely poor. Sam Rockwell decides to go beat up redhead boy funding the billboards after his chief kills himself cause I guess he think those billboards killed his chief? We never saw any of that anger so it is just came left field without reasoning. The chief killing himself also makes no sense. There was absolutely 0 development that he was struggling with cancer. Just one cough of blood here and there and some dark jokes about cancer. The movie failed to deliver that aspect and so him killing himself after making sex jokes with his wife made no sense. Here is where the movie gets even more messy. The town blames the billboards for what caused his death, but before that happened. Frances McDormand says to Woody that everyone knows he had cancer. SOOOOO WOULDN'T HIS STRUGGLE WITH CANCER BE THE REASON WHY HE KILLED HIMSELF? WOULD THAT BE A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION AND NOT THE BILLBOARDS? Way to contradict yourself director/writer. This film is full of contradictions like these. The movie itself overall doesn't work well as a dark dramedy. The comedy is not funny and repetitive. It's a lot of derogatory jokes and ""oh that's from a book, oh that's from a movie."" Those ships have sailed long ago. There is nothing original about this film at all.

","This probably started out as a good idea. There's something fascinating about a cantankerous. outspoken kind of woman obsessing over an awful unsolved crime, and fighting the police on doing their job. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it ends up mixing the more occasional thoughtful, interesting moments with a ridiculously clichÃ©d portrayal of small- town police as redneck buffoons, absurd Saturday-morning-cartoon style logic, Tarantino-imitating dialogue (cutesy circular monologues where the speaker enjoys correcting themselves, overly witty for the character in question because what you're really hearing is a self-obsessed eager-to-impress screenwriter, a woman talking to herself via her slippers where every single line repetitively blurts 'm****rf****rs'), irritating un-pc humour (yeah we get it, rednecks endlessly throwing out 'n***er' and 'f***ot', child abuse, dwarfs, kicking girls in the crotch etc is so fearless and edgy!) and huge tonal shifts that ruin the moment before or after. An underlying message of the film (something about kindness being more curing than anger) gets compromised in a final scene which seems forced and against all character logic. A moment half- way through sends the core of the film in a different direction, where it could easily be retitled ""Three Letters from Ebbing, Missouri"".<br/><br/>I haven't felt so frustrated before by the idea of less being better. If certain absolutely-unnecessary scenes, moments, lines, quips and slurs were edited out, it would be a much more efficient and powerful film. <br/><br/>Its also awkward to see as a shared experience - audiences simply don't know how to react or respond to certain tonally uneven moments, so can't help but nervously laugh at anything they think is suggestive of humour (e.g. an innocent school girl getting needlessly kicked in the crotch by an adult woman). The protagonist is often entirely rude and ignorant in her attack monologues, but rather than sympathise with her mis-directed anger, audiences are more inclined towards 'go girl!' style moronic agreement. It just feels jarring. It Would be much better absorbed on the small screen."

","From a very focused starting point, that seems almost poetic, namely three Billboards outside a small town with a simple question asked in an accusetory tone the movie gets desorientend and graps to sentimalism in order to create progression.<br/><br/>Mildred is angry. Angry and bitter beyond point of no return. She insists upon, and thereby gambling everything in her life, to have those three billboards standing, accusing the local sheriff (Woody Harrelson) for not catching the person who raped, killed and burnt her daughter.<br/><br/>We follow the reactions in the town as a result of this and at this point it seemed like an interesting premise to explore what conflicts and alliances this could bring about.<br/><br/>Sad to say, but every single personality trait was stereotyped.... I will elaborate by pointing out how the movie seemed to try to force us to laugh of two insecure and retarded people making stupid comments as their most defining characteristic. Even Adam Sandler is more funny than this.<br/><br/>Everybody shouts, curses, threats and beats the hell out of each other.<br/><br/>And then, more or less as a consequence of the sheriffs suicide, everybody decides to become friends and although the movie plays on the socialdrama theme, the reconciliation is fairy tail like. For instance (spoiler) One of the retarded police officers has beaten the hell out of a guy and afterwards thrown him out of a first floor window. By accident they share a room in a hospital and this guy without any preliminary process of anger accepts the apology by leaving a glass of orange juice on the officers table.

Frances McDormand is Mildred whose daughter was raped and murdered 7 months earlier. She is the Five Stages of Grief writ large. She is angry, in denial, feels guilty, etc, etc. She excels in the role but I felt the character was too much like her famous role in Fargo. I didn't feel that she had to start from scratch in creating the persona of Mildred; it just wasn't that much of a reach.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson plays the police chief and again surprises me at how good an actor he can be. There wasn't much of a development arc here but he still was fun to watch. He reminded me of Andy Griffith; a good hearted sheriff surrounded by lesser men and who had more going on upstairs than he let on. <br/><br/>Sam Rockwell was very good. I honestly did not realize it was him playing the drunk, racist cop until the credits rolled. <br/><br/>Music. Sucked. OK I just don't like country music as a soundtrack, especially when sung by angst ridden women. <br/><br/>This isn't really a movie, it's a series of scenes that somewhat flow from one to another.

The aftermath needs more expanding rather than a simple firing. I can't believe that he's not locked up. Then his character takes a 180 turn as the movie climaxes. He leaves the movie a two dimensional billboard rather than a fully formed human character. I am much more impressed with Mildred, Willoughby, and their connection. McDormand delivers a driven character of the first order and Harrelson is more human in his reservation. There is real power behind their performances whereas Rockwell is doing a cartoon.

But that's not the reason behind a 5 star rating. I was settled on the score when the credits rolled. I was surprised to see that the director is the one behind ""In Bruges"" as that movie is on my watch-list and I'm sceptical about it after witnessing this mess, although I also guess that 10 years can do a lot to a writer (look no further than mister M.

There's is one good shot in the movie that justifies the ratio, I'll give it that, but most of the time it's really annoying to watch, and I'll give my opinion as to why:<br/><br/>This movie IS post-modernism. It wants to be everything and it is nothing. It wants to be Fargo, it wants to be Twin Peaks, it wants to be Police Academy, it doesn't settle on one single plot line for longer than 15 minutes and it just aimlessly wanders around, somewhere between a feminist manifesto and dark comedy, but not quite, and a left-wing propaganda cut and a serious drama, but not quite, leading basically nowhere. And don't get me wrong, it is quite entertaining, but it is entertaining in the same way that watching random YouTube videos is.<br/><br/>The first thing I said after watching this film was ""well this is a movie that you don't need to watch twice"", and that's basically the gist of it. It's not a terrible movie, it's watchable, and if you like cry-bating drama and you grew up thinking that you're edgy but not as edgy as the dorks in your class at witch you involuntarily laughed at, then this will definitely be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The acting from the a and b-listers in this movie was top-notch, only 1 supporting character was kinda off but the rest gave an amazing performance, the pacing is fine, as you never get bored, and well: it's a movie after all.<br/><br/>It just doesn't hook you in any way, it doesn't offer a challenge, it doesn't do anything at all and, spoiler alert, it doesn't lead anywhere at all.

","I'm not much of a fan of the whole Coen Brothers non-linear method of film making I have to say and identified quite early on that this particular movie fell squarely into whatever category that might be. I guess I should have known from the offbeat title and cast that things would go every which way but loose and so it proves.<br/><br/>The initial idea of angry mother Frances McDormand broadcasting her frustration at her local police division by paying for three adjacent billboards to highlight their inaction over the unsolved rape and murder of her daughter some seven months previously might have worked in my view, not least as a whodunit, but was soon swamped by the introduction of several unusual characters and as many unlikely situations.<br/><br/>So we're introduced soon enough to Woody Harrelson's terminally ill chief of police who McDormand's character names and shames on the billboards, Sam Rockwell as his mother-fixated, redneck deputy, with many more minor characters too numerous to mention, like the dwarf who alibis MacDormand at an important moment in the story, her abusive ex-husband now dating a 19 year old pretty bimbo and the new black chief of police who takes over Harrelson's job and whose first action is to overlook Rockwell's near-murder of the homosexual young owner of the billboard company with whom it's fair to say, he doesn't see eye to eye.<br/><br/>The movie is a succession of tangential plot shifts and unbelievable coincidence. No doubt the writer - director was presenting us with themes of forgiveness, redemption and guilt set in the backward-thinking, crazy-quilt Deep South just to double underline these issues and make the viewer think deeply about all this serious existential stuff y'all.<br/><br/>Sorry, but I didn't buy any of it. The acting didn't impress me much either, and that includes McDormand's Oscar-winning turn. In the end, for me, it was just another of those eccentric, eclectic films that tries to implant what it thinks are memorable images or extraordinary characters into the viewer's consciousness and by its exaggeration and distortion somehow mirror society in some profound way. All I got from it in the end was a mixed sense of manipulation, confusion and cynicism and how easy it is to put a movie like this together and call it art.<br/><br/>Sorry, not for me and you can broadcast that on any billboard you care to mention."

I don't get the hype about her performance here. Woody is as great as always but I still don't care for the story surrounding his character, and he seems overall pointless to the plot when it's all said and done. Sam Rockwell is the best part of the film, hands down, but the wasted potential (see above) of his character is the biggest failure of the entire project. <br/><br/>I watched this because a family member wouldn't shut up about how great it is. After giving it a chance, I don't even have the heart to admit I ever saw it...and quite frankly, I'll probably soon forget I had."

","The movie itself, as well as the reviews make it seem like we are watching a heroic mother fighting to get justice. This is not even remotely the case. Our protagonist is a reprehensible creature, who is so absurdly selfish and plainly disgusting, that she won't stop at anything to somehow sate her feeling of guilt. This is not about justice, or even about revenge, her motivation is purely selfish. Therefore, the entire point of this movie is watching a horrible person, as well as a terrible mother, attempt to lie to herself and try to blame someone else.<br/><br/>The acting, especially from Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson, was really good though.

","Three Billboards is an immensely enjoyable viewing experience. The characters are carnivalesque, outrageous and troubling in one turn, heroic and inspiring at the next. McDonagh quite deliberately does not let you find a moral centre in his tale. There is a 'save the cat' moment very early in the film, a character helping an insect rather than crushing it, that is so mechanical that I flinched. Shame on me for falling so easily into McDonagh's trap. The plot zig-zags and leaves you breathless trying to process each new piece of information. The dialogue crackles with delicious insults. I laughed hard, and often. And then I cried. And winced. And laughed again. There is one scene of quite shocking violence. The performances have been lauded, and rightly so, as Frances McDormand, Caleb Landry Jones, Sam Rockwell , and Woody Harrelson bump and smack against each other tied to the roller-coaster plot. Peter Dinklage gets the chance to show his range. But while the praise for the acting is merited, the praise for the screenplay is more problematic. A huge coincidence in the final 20 minutes sets off a chain of events that leads to a redemption that is unearned, and a reconciliation that seems implausible. ""Love,"" implores a missive from one character to another, and the moral turn that character takes on that one command is too abrupt and too unequivocal. It also asks for forgiveness of acts already witnessed, and implied, that are far too egregious to be forgotten. A flawed film then, but perhaps all the more interesting for those flaws. Don't make the mistake of seeing it alone like I did - you will definitely want to talk to someone straight after viewing."
"zkonedog","7","2","2","5 March 2018"," Odd Tone Sometimes, But More Often Than Not Has Interesting Things To Say
","I honestly cannot say I've ever seen a film take on such different tones during its runtime as ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". One moment you'll be chuckling; the next crying...often within the same scene, in all honesty. This certainly makes it unique and gives it the ability to ""stand out from the crowd"". Does it make it an all-time classic? I would say no. But it is certainly interesting and worth watching, as it feels relevant for the times in which it was made.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Three Billboards"" tells the story of Mildred (Frances McDormand), a woman whose daughter was raped and murdered and the local police department, led by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), has yet to make any arrests or really have any leads at all. As a result, Mildred puts up a series of three billboards in her town of Ebbing, MO, which call out the local police force for essentially not doing their jobs. Predictably, this causes a stir among the small town, and Mildred must try to weather the storm of criticism that comes with such an act.<br/><br/>What made this movie work for me was the fact that it contained some great character development pretty much across the board. For example, a police officer played by Sam Rockwell seems pretty much irrideemable for most of the film, yet in the end becomes almost sympathetic. This film establishes a set of characters in the opening minutes, and then almost completely changes all of their characterizations over the course of the runtime. I have a lot of respect for a film that can effectively do this.<br/><br/>That being said, I almost wish that ""Three Billboards"" had played things a little bit straighter, or like a more conventional drama. Sure, the dark humor and sometimes very odd character interactions (especially towards the beginning of the film) makes it stand out, but I felt that it also was a bit distracting in terms of the overall message. At its core, this seems like a very emotional, heartfelt film with a message to get across. Can that effectively be done even with the black humor? It can. But could it have been even more moving had it played it straighter? My answer to that would be yes.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Three Billboards"" is a solid film that is never boring, and will be a bit different than anything you've seen in quite some time. That alone will give it above-average marks from me. I'm not sure this one will stand the test of time, but it plays well in the current social setting, and I guess that is all it can be judged on for now."

As for me, I think it's incredibly overrated.<br/><br/>The story is about an angry mom, Mildred (Frances McDormand). Her daughter was brutally murdered and raped...and the police haven't been able to do anything with the case. So, in desperation and anger, she rents out three billboards and calls the local Police Chief (Woody Harrelson) to task for this. Surprisingly, most of the town comes down against Mildred...who was just exercising her First Amendment rights. What happens from there...well, just see the film.<br/><br/>There were many wonderful scenes and characters in this picture. But, there were also many main characters who were just god-awful and unlikable...including Mildred! In fact, later in the film when she thinks the police department has wronged her, she burns down the building and accidentally flames one of the cops! So, no one who is a main character in the film is nice or likable...making this movie a bit of a hard-sell.

It had the crimes - so many, MANY crimes - and yet, the guilty seemingly kept getting away with literal murder, but since it was ""justified,"" it was okay.<br/><br/>Yeah, I laughed out loud and agreed with a lot of the protagonist's monologues, but that doesn't make what we see on screen okay. Nor does it make the incredibly annoying dipshit deputies' actions okay.<br/><br/>Basically, a broken mother's daughter is brutalized and killed which follows an inept and racist police force to do nothing. So, she takes Death Wish matters into her own hands and all-but makes a comedy out of the serious situation. <br/><br/>This very much felt like a Coen brothers' feature, except the blend of real and slapstick did not work. I could be in near tears for the tragedies displayed or the GOTCHA! moments and instead of easing into a spoof-like comedy bit, it just hit me like a two by four. I think it would've worked so much better if it chose which movie it wanted to be: screwball comedy or serious drama.<br/><br/>That all said, again, it was absolutely hilarious in moments and really heartbreaking in others. I guess if you wanted to see horrifying tragedies with out-of-place hilarity, this is the Best Pic Nom for you.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: As for the Oscars, it's a no for Best Pic from me, a BIG NO for Sam Rockwell, a maybe for Woody Harrelson and screenplay and a pretty big YES for Frances McDormand who is, by far, the best aspect of this movie."

It doesn't look like Missouri, and it was in fact shot on the east coast. More distressingly, the characters act (and talk) nothing like small-town Americans. This is a deeply classist film, made in outright contempt of the very people it depicts. It seems to speak exclusively to those with a left-leaning political bias who who enjoy having their partisan delusions validated. To put it another way, this is a movie about Trump voters, made by a Brit who doesn't even understand Brexit voters.<br/><br/>If this were strictly a comedy, it would simply be offensive. But this is a drama which purports to have a higher purpose than mere laughter, and worse, this is a film that feigns realism. For that reason, I consider this a blatant display of unforgivable bigotry.<br/><br/>If you decide to watch this film, try imagining that the black characters are white and the white characters are black.

"davispittman","10","11","21","5 March 2018"," Wow! That was a great film!
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) really is a fantastic film, definitely deserved its Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards. They just got everything right with this one! A film of this type is very difficult to make. The main reason it's so tough, is because yes it's pretty dark due to the subject matter, but it also has some comedy sprinkled in occasionally. You have to make sure that the comedy sprinkled in does not make the subject out to be a joke, or that it doesn't diminish it in any way. Luckily, this one was done in a very smart fashion. When there is comedy, it is very funny, but when it's time to be serious and focus on the darker aspects, no on is laughing. That's how you pull off a film like this successfully. The plot surrounds Mildred, played by Frances McDormand. She rents three billboards just outside of Ebbing, where she lives. Those billboards have messages on them that go after the local police department, she is doing this because her daughter was raped and murdered and she doesn't think the cops are doing anything about it. After she does this, there is a lot of backlash and there are consequences that people suffer. I won't give away any spoilers, but let's just say that you won't be taking your eyes off the screen. Part of the reason for that is because of the cast this film boasts. McDormand gives a fabulous performance here, I mean I was blown away by her raw talent that was displayed here. So glad she took home the Oscar for this powerhouse performance. Woody Harrelson is good here too, his character isn't quite as big as McDormand and Sam Rockwell's, but he still did a good job. Sam Rockwell is a very talented actor and he proved that talent here with his portrayal of the very complicated, messy character that he plays. I loved every cast member and what they brought to the film. The writing is witty, clever, and above all, intelligent. I 100% recommend this film."
"jtindahouse","10","11","21","30 December 2017"," How can one film be so perfect in so many ways?
","Last year I had the unfortunate duty of giving the eventual Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards a negative review. 'Moonlight' was not a movie that sat well with me. Now this is a very early call on my part but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm writing the review for the 2018 winner as we speak, and I can assure you it's not going to be a negative review this time around. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the finest film I have watched in a long time. How a film that can break your heart so effortlessly can also manage to be so damn funny and charming at the same time is simply beyond me. It shouldn't be possible. However writer/director Martin McDonagh proves that it can indeed be done.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand in the lead role is astonishingly good. There are many cries at the moment that there aren't enough movies with females in the lead role. Well showing them that the best film in 2017 has one is a good place to base your argument from. She is so good that you can feel her broken heart and soul almost as if it is your own. Sam Rockwell is also nothing short of superb. He remains one for the best actors working today and I only wish he would take on more work. Finally Woody Harrelson is fantastic in the film. He seems to be so endlessly charming in every film he appears in these days. Was that always the case? Regardless, he is a brilliant edition to this film.<br/><br/>Be prepared going into this movie is all I will say. It will take you on an abolsute rollercoaster of emotions. There are times where a hilarious line is delivered and you might actually stop and question yourself, ""Am I allowed to laugh in a film this dark?"" I know the Oscar nominations aren't even out yet, but I am extremely hopeful that this is the final film read out on ceremony night. Great films deserve great recognition."
"kjproulx","10","29","67","2 November 2017"," One Of The Best Films Of The Year
","It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.<br/><br/>After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile.<br/><br/>From the very first few frames of this film, you can tell the tone will be handled perfectly. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh with pure class, you can tell that he was very passionate when bringing this film to fruition. Every line of dialogue either progressed the story along, developed a character, made the audience laugh, or provided deep insight into the event of the murder itself. While not having the bearings of a conventional murder mystery, many viewers may not like the way this film concludes, but in the context of the movie as a whole and everything it's setting out to accomplish, it really does have a realistic and true finale.<br/><br/>It's arguable that some of the law enforcement officers play just as significant a role as Mildred does throughout the film, being pretty much present every time a revelation occurs, but I gravitated the most towards Officer Dixon. I've always been a huge fan of Sam Rockwell, and his character here is one of the most essential to this story, set on being there from beginning to end, trying his absolute best to be of any help. While Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Chief Willoughby is by far the most important to the story at hand, it's the characters around him that drive him to his actions throughout the course of the movie. The characters are truly what make this film as likable as it is, and they're all wonderfully drawn.<br/><br/>Overall, when looking back on my experience watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, I find myself not being able to wait until its official theatrical release to watch it again. I found this film to be stellar in every sense of the word. From a noteworthy performance by Francis McDormand, devoted secondary performances, a screenplay that will have you consistently laughing, while also being emotionally involved with the serious storyline at hand, and pulling the audience in with its subtly composed score, everything about this film is worth praise. This was a huge surprise for me and I can't recommend you checking it out enough. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a fantastic piece of modern cinema."

","Now that I have your attention...<br/><br/> Writing and directing one's own movie has always been a dangerous undertaking with often fatal consequences, but one which can never work (I thought we'd learned this lesson) unless the auteur is brutally honest and objective about his vision, and takes her creative and professional ego out back and shoots it in the head. The undertaking has brought down even titans and more than a few teenie titans: Welles, Cimino and Kostner, to single out but a few who come speedily to mind. And not even those two wunderbrÃ¼der the Coens have the stones to go it alone. The writer/director of 3 Billboards takes his place among the former with this film. <br/><br/> I hate to be a buzz killer, but did you guys see the same movie I did? 3 Billboards should be requisite study in every legitimate and phony film school across America for its shameless, self-indulgent display of virtually every pitfall a writer/director can fall into and break his neck. This is the movie you end up with when a writer/director (W/D) falls in love with every word he scrawls and any masturbatory idea that occurs to him and his libidinous muse on the set. A confused, confusing and, at times, downright silly mishmash of tones: variously dramatic or melodramatic amid flights of low and high comic relief, with infuriating moments of satire and farce (throw enough darts, something'll stick), all the while daring our hearts to remain in a solid state after every full-term, pregnant pause. Maddeningly slow paced and often ah-c'mon-improbable, including its longed-for, but much-delayed ""are-you-frikkin'-kiddin'-me"" ending. A two-hour-plus flip of the bird in the face of the Unities, no sin in itself, to be sure, but before you break artistic rules, learn why they were made in the first place. As a result, this is a movie written and directed by one delusional person that looks like it had two directors, at least, and a committee of writers, each with a different take on, and a bunch of kool, unrelated cinematic ideas for, three related/unrelated stories. I'd love to know what the Coens think of this movie. Were they on the floor howling or on their knees begging him to let them re-cut the film?<br/><br/> And what really got me was that every few minutes there were scenes nearing perfection: the first 20 minutes; that riveting scene with Frances and Woody on the yard swing; Woody and his wife at the fateful paddock. (Hey, W/D, why's his wife foreign-born? What was that about? Another inspired distraction that amounts to zip? Oh...diversity...ah-huh...yes...lots of diversity in MO) He did let one moment slip by, though, when younger cop, with shotgun in hand and light bulbs of self-awareness and self-actualization going off all around him, takes leave of his repulsive sloth...sorry...dozing mother. I was praying for a predictable, albeit unedited, confession of guilt, replete with flashbacks and a dream ballet, followed by a graphic murder/suicide and a quick wrap-up. No such luck. W/D has a real thing for red herrings. <br/><br/> People spend a whole lot of time saying goodbye in this movie or staring blankly, but bravely, into a vague, unforeseeable future or backwards into murky pasts fraught with anger and regret. Sometime close to that illusive ending, I began to fear an intermission was looming and that two more hours of pickled herring were in store for me. My restless leg syndrome was kicking up, I had to piss and, although I don't smoke, I needed a cigarette bad. Frances was saying goodbye to the younger cop (I know, you all know that actor's name except me)....let's say the cop's name was Wilbur. The screenplay goes something like this...again and again and again...<br/><br/> Younger cop Wilbur heads for door. Frances, CU in profile, lest her face betray a widening crack in her grief-fueled temporary insanity, stops him with: <br/><br/>FRANCES: Wilbur...<br/><br/> Wilbur halts at door. He turns. He is pulled into focus and Frances goes fuzzy. (I'm thinking,""I couldn't have see this movie already..."") The emotional difficulty for both of them at this moment is palpable. A silence falls. (""...maybe I need to #2"") 
 <br/><br/>WILBUR: Yeah?<br/><br/>This is more difficult than she thought. She pauses to swallow 
her courage and gather her pride. (An eighteen-wheeler passes) <br/><br/>FRANCES (back in focus); a Chekhovian Pause (The Six-Oh-Eight thunders by), then: Thanks...<br/><br/> Wilbur stares at this remarkable, yet maddening, woman in silence for a while, (Just how much is a pack of Reds these days?) then slowly turns and exits. Slowly. <br/><br/> Slow dissolve.<br/><br/>I wanted to scream out the lines! It takes one cotton-pickin' second to say WilburYeahThanks. Not fifteen. Unless you have an unnatural relationship with your own screenplay. Once upon a time, there was a director who used to say that pauses were expensive and had to be spent carefully. They don't accomplish what amateurs think they do. They ruin pace, insult the audience and are probably the tritest signal of cheap sentimentality.<br/><br/> Frances, thank you thank you for your clipped delivery of that ridiculous monologue about the Crips and the Bloods. And please say you refused to memorize it. I hope they put that extended-till-it-snapped metaphor on a Teleprompter for you. <br/><br/> Supporting roles: OK, I'm going to be nice and not mention any names which I won't remember anyway, because I bet a lot of inexperienced actors are thinking this was their big break, and, given our current atmosphere of Trump-era credulity, it just might be, but, like my old friend Harry Pebbel told me...oh, God...years and years ago, ""For nothing, you get nothing."" There are a dozen amateur performances in this movie reflecting a tight acting budget beyond its stars: raw, unrehearsed young actors and day players, struggling with stagy, didactic or overstated lines of bumpy dialogue and incongruous comedy. <br/><br/> But wait! Along comes another supporting player, the new Police Chief. A black man. Good choice. Nice touch of irony within the context of the film and maybe the kick in the ass this crashing bore needs. But then the guy opened his mouth... <br/><br/> Now, it is unquestionably possible for anyone with an ear to learn to speak Eastern Standard English. That's the dialect American stage actors are, or used to be, required to learn. I believe it only survives indigenously in an island of territory somewhere around the border of New York and Connecticut. I do not doubt that black Americans have grown up in that area and could have chosen to assimilate that style of speech. But. I'll bet the ranch that not one of them has ever aspired to the position of Chief of Police of a backwater Missouri burg. This was a directorial choice (it's not an acting one) that, though perhaps cheered by guilt-ridden Hollywood revisionists and other champions of Fake News (Fake News/Fake Messages: same difference), was utterly improbable and downright laughable. In fact, I did laugh. Sidney Poitier had or often used (dunno which) a very distinctive dialect more than 60 years ago. It was erudite, cultured and completely comprehensible (unlike many of the actors in this flick, especially Younger Cop). It was also unabashedly African-American. In In The Heat Of The Night, though he sounded like he could very well have been to college, he, most assuredly, did not sound like he went to Yale School of Drama, but abandoned the theater for a career in Public Safety. <br/><br/> The leads: I bet this looked like a great idea on paper, and presuming pitiless cuts, massive rewrites and objective editing, it's easy to see how Frances and Woody were attracted to the project early on. Woody looks and sounds great, a real imposing and contrasting presence in a movie brimming with homely people. Frances McDormand is a national treasure. She is never bad. A movie may be, but she cannot be, because of the roles she chooses and the richness of her characterizations. She is, and will remain forever, original, engaging and intriguing, like Geraldine Page, Judi Dench, Bette Davis and a few other fortunates whom the Hollywood Powers-That-Be never tried (or failed) to turn into glamor pusses. But an Oscar for this mess? No. Not even though I would have walked out after one hour of abuse, if I hadn't, as per usual, been mesmerized by the way this actor fleshes-out, internalizes, communicates and believes in her characters. No, not even though I'm still haunted by the chilling lack of conscience and humanity in her Undead eyes. Other more worthy and Oscar-worthy movies are, doubtless, in the cards for her. If she does win, I'll content myself with the idea that she won the sympathy vote for not walking out in mid-production, claiming health issues. Or maybe they had money in the thing. Whatever. Younger Cop? Sorry, I thought he really blew until the last half hour when his character grew a set and/or that other director, maybe, took over. <br/><br/> This movie tries to tell three little stories simultaneously (Yeah, yeah, I get it: three billboards, three stories), pretty much succeeds with one (I'll let you decide which) and conflates the other two to near absurdity.<br/><br/> But I thought the sound track was first rate."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a different take on a crime/drama film filled with bits of dark comedy. What stood out for me in this film mostly was the acting, it was phenomenal. Frances McDormand plays this strong independent woman who fights for what she believes in. She does a great job of coming out as a cold person with no fear. Sam Rockwell stole the show for me, he brought most of the humor in my opinion. Overall the film had a thorough and entertaining plot which had you captivated, especially once the movie picks up pace. Someone in this film definitely deserves to win an oscar, whether it be Frances McDormand for best actress or Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor.

The scene were Frances McDormand confronts the priest in her kitchen stuck with me the most. <br/><br/>All actors deliver great performances, especially Rockwell and McDormand. <br/><br/>I do somehow feel like the movie and especially the topic had more potential. Some scenes felt so out of place and should have been cut from the movie (the deer scene and where Woody Harrelson says ""goodbye"" to his wife). It scratched the surface of so many topics, when instead it could have gone more in depth with the topic of rape culture and how the police handles the investigations. <br/><br/>However, I did like the humor and that it didn't feel forced but natural. It didn't ridicule or disrespect the very problematic topic but pointed out how ridiculously fucked up the system and society is."

","We saw this last week at a special screening as part of the SAG Film Society series and it just blew everything else we had seen away! I really loved Breathe and Wild River, but this was not only riveting in its development and surprising in its plot twists, but just fascinating to watch. The plot is crafted like an intricate puzzle that slowly spins out as the characters interact and react in completely unpredictable ways. The only thing I did NOT like about it is the ending, because I felt it not only left the audience hanging in the middle of the film, without resolving to a satisfying (for me) conclusion, but I also did not want it to END! That's how fascinating the characterizations are. McDormand and Rockwell are both standouts, but Harrelson definitely holds his own with them, as well as all of the supporting cast. I don't usually write reviews, but this was so memorable that I had to post something. I will not give anything away because it is better the less you know, but GO SEE IT!!!"
"imine-66631","1","5","8","30 November 2019"," Horribly Written and Unfocused
","TLDR, because I know you want it:
Everything is great but the writing. It's written like you're an idiot and you need to hear things 3 times. The character arcs are terrible and the rules of the world change when it's convenient. There are obvious ex-machinas and most characters are entirely flat like the son, the random black guy, and all the cops except for one, who is the antagonist. Bad movie.<br/><br/>""One star? Isn't that a little much?"" No.
I've been making my way down the top 250, nearly all of the movies on the list are amazing, it's wonderful. Hit after hit after hit, maybe an occasional decent film, but never anything less than a 7. This movie is my first 1/10, and I'm not one to exaggerate.<br/><br/>First, what's great about this movie? It's actually a pretty decent list:<br/><br/>Camera Work:
Well composed and well lit, but the colors on the outdoors shots lack a decent color palette, but I assume that was due to the drone they used.<br/><br/>Editing:
Not ground breaking, some little weird early cuts or long holds, but not bad.<br/><br/>Score:
A strange range from hillbilly to classical, but it fits the mood well.<br/><br/>Acting:
Good acting and good actors.<br/><br/>THE BAD:
Jesus christ, this is terrible. This writing is the only thing that brings this movie to the ground, it's so bad that the actors lose confidence in their lines and say them like a question. It blows my mind.<br/><br/>OK, why?
The script treats the audience like an idiot, it shows you something, then 3 other characters tell you what you just saw again. Example:<br/><br/>""ROBBIE
Oh, did you hear the news?<br/><br/>MILDRED
What news?<br/><br/>ROBBIE
That Dixon guy threw that Welby guy out
his window this morning.""<br/><br/>WE JUST WATCHED THAT SCENE! This writing is so bad. ""did you hear the news"" are you serous? Come up with a better way to inform another character.<br/><br/>Focus:
This movie takes a serous moment, then, at the very peak of tension, drops in a joke. Then, it tries to make another serous moment right after the joke, but turns it into another joke. Then, after that, it tries to take itself seriously with whatever the main character is doing and it acts all artistic with classical music, WHILE THEY ARE STILL TELLING A STUPID JOKE! See the station fire scene.
One second serous, the next a joke, the next serous, the next a joke.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it tries to take itself seriously in an unrealistic world. Sometimes people are punished, but if it's important to the story, or if they are the main character, reality suddenly doesn't apply. Stick to the rules of the world you create, don't just do it when it's convenient.<br/><br/>This movie has terrible character arcs. Our main character starts as a violent vengeful and angry god who is above the law and knows what everybody is about to say. Then, towards the end of the movie, she doesn't smash a wine bottle on her ex-husbands head, but she does get in the car with a plan to murder an unrelated rapist, but then says she doesn't want to. ""Wow, what a great character, she went from being outright violent to being morally ambiguous, great job."" The problem is is that we're supposed to be on her side.<br/><br/>Then, our much larger arc happens to a side character. This character starts as the comic relief and the antagonist. He's an idiot cop who does illegal stuff and gets away with it, his character arc happens when he gets a letter from his dead captain saying ""I know you're a idiot, but you could be a good guy if you wanted to, also I know you wanted to be a detective."" Then our main character sets the building on fire with him in it, but of course he doesn't know it because he's busy trying to have a moment. ""Oh, but our  antagonist is then rectified by saving the case file and running out of the window! Wow, I totally forgive him for throwing a billboard manager out of a two story window after beating him and his coworker nearly to death!"" Then, he goes on to get in a bar fight with a guy talking about how he raped a girl (which was a setup from earlier with a verbatim pay-off) and he scratches him to get his DNA. Well, it's not the right guy, but hey, now our protagonist and antagonist are friends, maybe they should plan to go kill the unrelated rapist in Idaho. Genius. ""So sharply written that it cuts"", ok, thanks Jeffrey M. Anderson.<br/><br/>WOW! LOOK! an ex-machina appeared, how convenient! These are summations of real situations in the film.<br/><br/>Mildred: Oh no! I now need $5,000 because of a plot twist!
Random character: Hey, this guy just dropped of the exact amount you need, he was Mexican, haha.
Mildew: oh wow, I'm going to go be a terrible person now that I know a god is watching over me!<br/><br/>Mildip: Oh no! my billboards are on fire, good thing I have this full-sized fire extinguisher in my car! But wait! It ran out! Oh, my son who has no definable characteristics or personality has brought me a second fire extinguisher!<br/><br/>Mildrain: Oh man, my billboards are unreadable due to a fire that I wont investigate, how am I going to solve this problem?
Random character who was introduced at the very beginning, and then was forgotten entirely: Hey I have these spare prints of all the billboards, do you want them?
Mildunce: Oh boy, what a convenient solution to this problem! Now disappear again for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>Bad film. 1/10."

We get that all women are strong heroes. Cops? All white supremacists. Blacks? All nobility. We GET it. Can't you just give it a rest and give us good movies? Entertainment? Sheesh. 
The irony is that the likes of McDormand and Harrelson would fly over a place like Billings with a shudder of relief that they don't have live in such a place. So both their performances came over to me as totally forced. 
And as to the ending... it actually made me laugh for audacity. You don't know how to untangle the web you've spun? Can't work out a resolution for the mystery? Oh, just cut the ending entirely. Let the audience think it's clever, artistic.

So as the oscars nominations cameout yesterday, i like to watch every nominated film which i didnt yet watch and i started with ""Three billboards ... "" ( such a long title ). 
I started this movie with great expectations due to its 8 nominations. As the movie went on i thought when will they catch the killer 
isnt that the whole point? 
Absolutely not! 
The whole point was in a great scene at the burning police station 
How the contrast was made with a woman burning down a police station and a man listening to music and reading a letter from his deceased partner about how he thought the ""antagonist"" (at this point) was a good guy and all he needs was to love and how love gives everyone better life and saves him from a fire.
Clearly this wasn't the first time when a character turned from bad to good 
Woody harrleson turned from ""going to war"" to sending a note to the woman who caused him trouble before death and i think the reason was his cancer spreading.
The advertising agency guy showed compassion to the fired police officer eventhough he was quite angry.
At the scene where they were going to kill the army officer, I felt as if the whole story was showing that the anger always wins but when they started raising doubts 
I was very happy that both of them were getting over their anger <br/><br/>I noticed two things that werent ""making sense"" in the scenario:
1) why did the soldier even go and do that to the old lady 
he doesnt even live there and he is a soldier why would he do that 
2) Why was the soldier scared of fighting a policeman 
he is in the army 
he got some commading office backing him up <br/><br/>Sorry i didnt know any name from the movie

","""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" is a flawed piece of work, and I say this as a fan of Martin McDonagh. <br/><br/>The audiences watching this movie in 2016-2017 should experience palpable dissonance between how race and police relations are portrayed onscreen versus reality. <br/><br/>The cast acquits themselves well. McDormand is laudable as is Harrelson (the movie is poorer after his exit). Rockwell is a capable player, but it is an ugly reality to see an actor inhabit such an ill-concieved role.<br/><br/>Look around and you'll find explanations and plaudits for ""Three Billboards"" but I'm asking you to think, really think. I know it's a dark comedy, and I've enjoyed McDonough's past work. I also know that the film does a disservice to race. By intent, or not, disservice is the reality. <br/><br/>I won't deny the catharsis I felt hearing McDormand's character roar at a local priest, having had a pedophile priest at my own school. There is emotional substance in the piece, although there are serious flaws regarding race. It's a conundrum to have an auteur channel a mother's rage so well and miss the mark so wide regarding police.<br/><br/>Martin McDonough is an Irishman who lives in London. For my part as an American, this film might have well been written by an alien who had no concept of American history, our foundation upon the horrific institution of slavery, or our current political climate. It's the sort of creative effort that would have me responding with a contemporary dramatic reading list, which would start with ""Blues for Mr. Charlie.""

Three Billboards also won two (2) Oscars for best actress in a leading role (Frances McDormand) and best supporting actor (Sam Rockwell) . Personally I thought Woody Harrelson who also received a nomination for best supporting actor was deserving more of the Oscar than his fellow co-star Sam Rockwell.<br/><br/>I do not want to second guess the Oscar voters but Frances McDormand in my opinion was just playing herself in this film. If you don't believe me watch the film and then google her Oscar acceptance speech and then tell me if you do not agree that Frances McDormand's acceptance speech is exactly the feisty character portrayal of Mildred in Three Billboards. I felt Sally Hawkins performance as the mute cleaning lady on The Shape of Water was far more difficult to portray on screen than Mildred in Three Billboards.<br/><br/>Three Billboards supporting cast also included some great talents wasted in peripheral meaningless roles such as actors Darrell Britt-Gibson, Lucas Hedges, Amanda Warren, Zeljko Ivanek and especially John Hawkes. The story line of a distraught mother who wants her daughter's rapist/murderer brought to justice and how she goes about pressuring the town Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to not only do his job, but his deputies as well. <br/><br/>Lastly, I felt the ending was aborted purposely to allow for a sequel and another revenue producer at a later date to cash in on the six (6) Oscar nominations.

I have written the summary many times and i have erased in every occasion. So i decided to show some dots in the summary. That is the symbol of how excellent the movie is.<br/><br/>The plot :<br/><br/>The plot is very much uncommon. it has so many facts that it offers you a guessing 2 hour while you goes through the movie. It provides enough backbone to the rest of the element of the movie. It creates a concrete base upon which the movie stands firmly.<br/><br/>The mystery :<br/><br/>As the movie deals with a murder it contains enough mystery to shake the audiences. Scene after scene all this unpacked. But they have to wait till the end to solve the puzzles.<br/><br/>The resistance : <br/><br/>The movie is about the resistance of a mother. It starts with the desperate mission of a mother to bring the killers of her daughter to light. Those billboards, the sudden attacks, burgaining against the local authority.. all these are the part of a resistant mother which is also the part and parcel of the movie.<br/><br/>Acting :<br/><br/>Acting in my view is up to the mark. Frances Mcdormand is exquisite in her role as a mother seeking justice. Others have also come to the party.<br/><br/>Direction :<br/><br/>This is the characterstics of the movie i was most impressed with. Although the plot and the acting is out of question but it is the director who has the sole credit to connect all this. He has slowly but cleverly unfolded all the sector available. He is good enough to make the movie what it looks like in the projector. He has turned the raw materials to a mature masterpiece.<br/><br/>Questions and answers :<br/><br/>last of all the main event is the answers of the question that were aroused during the first session of the movie. You have to wait to find the answers. This waiting makes it more attractive.<br/><br/>So clearly it is a movie of great quality..a bit older type..but you know old is gold.."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri stars Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges and Peter Dinklage, and is directed by Martin McDonagh, who brought us the sensational In Bruges, and Seven Psychopaths.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Mildred Hayes, played by McDormand, who some time ago, her teenage daughter was to quote the film, ""raped while dying"", in small town Ebbing in the mid-west of the USA. The local police and authorities, Chief Willoughby and Dixon, played by Harrelson and Rockwell, at least in Mildred's eyes, aren't pulling their weight in avenging and bringing to justice her daughter's perpetrator. So she takes the liberty of erecting three billboards outside the town, bought and paid for through Red, played by Landry Jones, to raise awareness of her daughter's death. However these billboards stir up some controversy within the town.<br/><br/>Now I'm just gonna come clean here and say that I wasn't a huge fan of this film, but I'll address the positives first. Absolutely top notch acting, Frances McDormand brings serious bite and something really scathing, and I definitely think it's one of the best performances of the year, possibly the best of her career. Woody Harrelson, to an extent, brings real humanity to the role, not to get into spoilers, but there's a scene where he approaches Mildred about the billboards for the first time, and there's a big reveal of his character and what he's going through, and Mildred's searing comments on this reveal, and Willoughby's reaction to said comments was top tier acting. In a single shot, and in his expression, you really saw tragedy, heartbreak and a sense of pity for Mildred, completely brought by Harrelson's fantastic performance. Then you have Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell, whose character, like Willoughby, goes through some VERY unpredictable directions, at the start he's a bigoted, ignorant, racist buffoon red neck, and by the end he still kinda is, but many many more things as well, which was completely unexpected. I think Rockwell was the big standout of the film. It's an example of with certain screenwriting, you can have a character's arc and morals go completely up, down, sideways, backwards, in circles and inside out, and I was amazed by where he went just as a character, so credit to him and McDonagh's accomplished writing.<br/><br/>The editing is right on point too, there's scenes where Harrelson's character is reading letters that he wrote, and the way the structure of shots goes back in time, forward in time etc, as he's narrating these letters, and just the shot structure and lengths for scenes throughout the film is pretty brilliant.<br/><br/>Ultimately however, I just wasn't that convinced by this movie as a whole, Harrelson's character makes a big ol decision midway, that was meant to be SHOCKING and devastating, but there just wasn't any build up to it, so it just kinda happened unexpectedly and suddenly, that my reaction was more just ""Oooookay?!?!?"" than what it was meant to be. Dixon's character also makes a big decision upon what happens with Willoughby, and it just felt completely out of left field and unconvincing, even for a crazy bastard like him....<br/><br/>So it was two BIG scenes that just didn't click for me. The film is also SO unrelentingly sardonic, mean spirited, depressing and angry that it just left me feeling... kinda nauseous. I've definitely never been one to just be like ""well that movie wasn't happy-happy joy-joy and didn't make me feel good and nice, therefore I hate it"", but there's just no end, no opposition and no upside to the bitterness that it just felt like ""misery porn"" interlaced with quirky, off-beat humour, and it just didn't sit well with me. But like I said the acting, directing, certain aspects of the character and writing, and editing is all phenomenal. But you just can't have a movie where characters just DO things without adequate motivation, build up or reasoning behind it, and for me at least those things weren't adequate enough to be convincing."

","For a movie which built so much tension throughout the first hour or so, a lot was wasted in the last third part of the film. As a positive, the acting, script and the twists, especially midway through the film, set up for a spectacular finale. However, what we are left with is a wasted opportunity, when the movie takes a sudden change of tone, from a crime drama to an almost romantic finish. There were many moments where the film could have simply ended, albeit on a much better note, rather than extending it far too long, and creating unanswered questions the answers to which are essential to the main storyline. In my opinion, the film needed to be shorter or longer - either not have brought about new issues which were not explored sufficiently in the first place (shorter), or alternatively, extending the film a bit more to demonstrate the consequences of the character's respective actions (longer). Instead, we are left somewhere in between, completely dissatisfied."

"bkrauser-81-311064","7","9","18","17 October 2017"," A Tale with No Easy Answers
","In the words of poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, the beauty of film is ""You get poetic justice in less than 3 hours. You often don't get poetic justice in a lifetime."" If that'd be the case than the collective works of Martin McDonagh serves as a counterweight to such thinking. His films, often involve looking in vain for the nebulous concepts of love, justice and meaning in a post-modern world. His characters, likable if deeply flawed, shout into the void but never find the answers they seek.<br/><br/>Thus it's hard to truly gage a film like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Much like In Bruge (2008) and Seven Psychopaths (2012), this film is rich with wit yet syncopated in its own world of messy loops, twists, turns and tones. The story begins with the melodies of Renee Fleming's ""Tis the Last Rose of Summer"" but then ends the first five minutes on the screen in capital letters. The letters spell out ""RAPED WHILE DYING,"" ""STILL NO ARRESTS?"" ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY"". So starts the saga of the Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, sanctioned by a grieving mother; printed for a dying man.<br/><br/>The mother in this case is Mildred Hayes (McDormand), who much like her billboards stands unwavering. She's hassled by everyone from Sheriff Willoughby's (Harrelson) clueless deputies to her ex-husband Charlie (Hawkes). Still, even when her son Robbie (Hedges) is incensed to give her the silent treatment, Mildred demands her message be heard. Her teenage daughter was raped and murdered seven long months ago and nothing has been done. She wants justice.<br/><br/>Yet the funny thing about justice in this movie is the moment you get a good handle on the concept, the film bleeds it away like water from outstretched hands. So too do the characters. Every time you get a firm understanding of who they are, something logical yet wholly unexpected forces you to assess and reassess. No one else best exemplifies this than Sam Rockwell's Office Dixon who goes from a racist Barney Fife to a numbed Travis Bickle with nary a dropped beat to make you question the change.<br/><br/>The ensemble carries the film through a lot of ugliness with grace. We glide uncomfortably close along the sharpened edges of rape, murder, abuse, suicide, alcoholism and racism. All the while questions like: ""is it okay to be angry in an unfair world?"" and ""how do our decisions affect others,"" smear into the ashy black comedy and imposing melodrama. Deep care was given to breathe life into these characters. Even when someone as non-consequential as Charlie's nineteen-year-old girlfriend (Weaving) enters the fray you can't help but admire how these people interact and curious about how they must feel.<br/><br/>Martin McDonagh more than ever invites comparisons to the Coen brothers in this film. A signal that to me at least proves McDonagh is ambitious, but out of his weight class at this point in his career. For while the Coen's approach their films with the same character-first, free-form narratives, there's always a level of benevolence behind the cynicism. Here, instead of smirk-worthy amusement there is anger. Instead of cosmic curiosity there is more anger. Instead of wonder, there's just more anger, and you know what they say about anger; it just begets moreÂ…anger.<br/><br/>If anger were the spice of life, then this murky soup would definitely be worth consuming. But as it is not, regular filmgoers should approach this witty, richly rendered film with extreme caution. McDonagh's oeuvre is an acquired taste and those liable to agree with Bachchan's approach to film may walk out severely shook. But for those fixing for an overall decent barnstorming black comedy, the ""Show Me"" state might just have something for you."

","I watched this movie during the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) after it had won the Grolsch People's Choice Award. I already had high hopes for this movie and it definitely did not disappoint! Concept of the movie seems pretty easy to understand: Mildred Hayes (played by Frances McDormand) is still grieving the loss of her murdered daughter and challenges the local sheriff's (Woody Harrelson) inability to find her killer. From watching the trailer I was a little unsure if this was going to be a drama or a comedy, but turns out it was both, or more accurately a dark comedy. The first few minutes of the movie really set the tone for keeping you interested in the dramatic core, maintaining the humour in events as they unfold. Not only are the characters perfectly cast individually (example my fav Sam Rockwell as Officer Jason Dixon), but the writing of the entire script makes it so easy to enjoy this entire movie. <br/><br/>Writer/Director Martin McDonagh deserves a high five for this accomplishment!"
"rdoyle29","9","12","27","5 December 2017"," A darkly comic, morally complex masterpiece
","Frances McDormand's daughter was raped and murdered, and it seems like no movement has happened on the case in months. Noticing three derelict billboards on a largely unused stretch of road just out of town, she rents them and puts up a personal challenge to local police chief Woody Harrelson. The police department, especially thuggish cop Sam Rockwell, are very unhappy about this turn of events. The town is divided. Harrelson is a popular man, but the department has a history of mistreating the town's less fortunate citizens (particularly the African American population), so many folks like seeing them called to task. This sets up what seems to be a very straightforward ""little guy vs authority"" story, but McDonagh has a more morally complex story in mind. Harrelson is a dying man, suffering from terminal cancer, and his explanation of why the case has gone nowhere seems quite reasonable. McDormand is suffering from understandable grief, but you learn that some of the grief might stem from a feeling of personal responsibility for the tragedy. Good characters do some really bad things. Bad characters commit horrifically violent actions, but then suffer from violence due to heroically self-sacrificing acts. Besides being a serious meditation on grief and revenge, it's also very darkly comic."

They are, here as in everything they've ever been in, great. They are ably supported by Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, Clarke Peters, Sandy Martin, Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes, Amanda Warren.

"Quinoa1984","10","14","33","24 November 2017"," Do the Right Thing in Ebbing, Missouri
","It takes not only a considerable amount of skill to match deep-dark- heartbreaking dramatic storytelling and characters with a pitchðŸ˜¨black comic edge; to go the extra mile one should hopefully have a voice. Martin McDonaugh may be mistaken too quickly as having made a Coen brothers film - Frances McDormand being there doesn't help assuage that argument - yet through In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths he's shown his acidic, no bullish*t, I see clichÃ©s for what they are and raise you a subversion original voice in writing and an assured hand in direction. He also casts his movies like nobody's business and from McDormand down to Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell's mom to the actress as Angela Hayes having one scene, he has everyone with fresh, Thanksgiving-buffet-plate meat to chew on. <br/><br/>While it's one of the best films of the year, I'm sure if I try, more or less, I can find some nitpick or even flaws - the daughter Hayes scene could be one simply for the final two lines mother and daughter have, I understand the point but it's too far on the nose, especially for this artist; another could be how quickly ""f***head"" Rockwell comes around to a kind-of-sort-of-maybe redemption in the third act - but all of this is overshadowed by the giant moral and social-political-emotional scope of everything else. Mildred Hayes is one of those movie characters that, male or female (but especially make), stays with you for not so much how balls they are but how marvelled they are by their own ballsiness.<br/><br/>McDormand has such a command of the character in the big moments - those trailer bits that, if ones been going to the movies this year, has been overplayed (though luckily practically all of the major story points aren't revealed) - one may miss a moment like when Mildred realizes a character did something horrible that she punished someone else for, or how she looks after a tough a-hole comes into her shop coming face to face with a threatening countenance. She's played so many people who carry an ocean of complexity but whats appealing is how she carries a lot of it without needing to show much. Hell, one beat where she has her two animal slippers on their feet talk in bold violent terms is among the great acting moments of the year. <br/><br/>So how relevant is it to now? I mention Do the Right Thing because not so much it having the same dramatic build up so much as it has a similar anger - no sorry not true, boiling, scornful rage - at how segments of our country have been, are and may always be (the mother of Rockwell is one such character who inspires such rage at least for me, and she is just your average white-bread matriarch. Also like Lee's film it shows a community who are inextricably linked, and at times the stark racism is almost like a bad joke (Rockwell's cop being a torturer of black inmates, if not more than one, is almost a goof; he's akin to the John Tururro type in DtRT, a man who just is what he is and it's too late to change now, so everyone looks at Mildred in this story and her whole billboards ""thing"" closer to something like a basic acting-out in grief than a howl for justice. And then when it comes time for a new man to come in to the town's police force, and I won't say how or why, and id rather you just see it than me put in the spoiler marker, it is like a cold bath of irony: the genuinely tough, decent, on top of it older black man. <br/><br/>This is as towering a script as we may get in American cinema this year, and if it has imperfections it shouldn't matter much. The central idea here is such: if you don't bring a light on stark injustice, people wont do much if nothing else because it's not on their mind or (frankly) in their own interests. Willoughby says at one point the billboards are a ""chess move."" What is the ""king"" to take then? The ending of the film may seem to leave things too open-ended for some, and I get that. To me, the end is that there's never an ending when it comes to looking at rape (which is assault) and other violence (which is more directly assault) there is no clear ending. You can kill yourself, sure, but that doesn't solve much for those who have to live in total pain. I love this!"

in a funny way, so yes the character is racist and have this a dark side, but at the same time funny and enjoyable to watch.
he is the kind of guy who can't do anything without asking his mother first, but he is uncomfortable with that and it showes very well in the way of pronouncing her name while someone mentioning her
 and making fun of him.( i couldn't stop laughing when his mother asked him : Do u want me to go to the police station asking them to bring you back!!!)<br/><br/>As for the whole film the directing is very good not brilliant, but again it's so decent ,

","""Three Billboards"" follows Andrea Arnold's ""American Honey"" (2016) and Edgar Wright's ""Baby Driver"" (2017) as part of a trend towards British auteur filmmakers writing and directing movies set in America. <br/><br/>But whilst the two earlier films were humanistic and optimistic portrayals of American life which didn't reduce Americans to stereotypes, ""Three Billboards"" feels trite and reductionist, and does not show the hallmarks of being written by someone who has ever spent much time in small-town America.<br/><br/>Apart from the strong accents there is very little attempt to create a sense of place - we get no establishing shots of the main street in the town or of its residential neighbourhoods, only individual buildings. We get a trio of memorable characters â€“ the stoical and obstinate Mildred, the rough diamond Chief Willoughby, and the ball of impotent rage that is Jason Dixon. But some aspects of the character development feel perfunctory and even lazy, in that Mildred, (like most of the supporting characters), is defined by her relationship to the billboards controversy and very little else. For instance, it struck me as odd that Mildred appears to have no outside interests or female friends her own age, and I'm not altogether clear about how she earns a living - she works in some kind of touristy gift ship but it's unclear whether she owns the business or is just employed there. Peter Dinklage is a very good actor but he is given very little to do. James, the character he plays, is rather sad and pathetic and his entire contribution to the story, such as it is, is defined by his dwarfism. <br/><br/>In so far as it's a socially-aware film, the treatment of the political issues is muddled and self-contradictory. For example, early on it feebly tries to make a point about police racism, then later it shows they're not racist after all because they can accept a black senior officer's authority without difficulty...Meanwhile the two named black civilian characters don't advance beyond predictable behaviour, in that they are both anti-police. <br/><br/>This sort of cynicism and borderline misanthropy may be forgivable if a movie works on the level of pure comedy, but for me - and I am perhaps in a minority here - it simply didn't. I felt the humour was vulgar and unimaginative in the extreme and was overly reliant on violence, anger and profanity. Most of the audience at the sell-out UK premiere laughed audibly throughout - I chuckled maybe four times. <br/><br/>There were all kinds of little things that irritated me. Why does Mildred's daughter have Nirvana posters on her wall if it's set in the present day? Why does Mildred have to deliver that rant about pederasty in the Roman Catholic Church, when it has no connection to the rest of the story and when Missouri is mainly Protestant anyway? And do we really need to be told that she was victim of spousal violence in her past marriage, when the film has nothing original or meaningful to say on the subject? What's the point in creating a strong, non-stereotypical female character only to make her a victim of male violence twice over?<br/><br/>So, how can I justify five stars? Well, it's an unconventional story with unconventional characters. It subverts the familiar trope of the plucky loner fighting against overwhelming odds, and challenges the idea that protest, non-conformity and anti-authoritarianism are good things in and of themselves. Mildred behaves appallingly but has a completely unshakeable sense of her own righteousness. Perhaps a bit like some of the people who take part in BLM and Antifa protests and use them as an opportunity to start fights and create mayhem. The ending is pleasingly ambiguous; it leaves open the possibility of some kind of redemption for the characters, but at the same time it recognises that Damascene conversions are rare in real life and that many of us only learn from our mistakes as fast as we make new ones.<br/><br/>Go to see it expecting a sort of sub-Tarantino celebration of stylised violence and amorality and you won't be disappointed. As film critic James Verniere once wrote in summing up another movie, it's good nasty dirty fun. But the sad thing is it could have been so much more."

Once again, a large cast of characters who are just just far enough out there to be funny, but grounded enough to be realistic find what should be an ordinary situation rapidly escalating out of control.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand stars as Mildred Hays, a grieving mother who decides the best way to encourage the police to solve her daughter's brutal murder is to put up three billboards outside town calling out the chief of police. That is enough to lite a fire under the town, quite literally, as the dying Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), his intellectually-challenged mamma's boy officer (Sam Rockwell), the town midget (Peter Dinklage), the man who owns the billboards (Caleb Landry Jones), and Mildred ex-husband (John Hawkes) all end up on a crash course towards each other. As they say ""Anger just begets greater anger"" and there is a lot of anger in Ebbing, Missouri.<br/><br/>Amazingly, a movie that is essentially nonstop chaos and overreactions manages to actually develop its characters and have them grow.

"BibleMaster","7","5","9","21 February 2018"," Great, Unpredictable Story, But Poorly Paced
","Engaging, interesting, deep, but poorly-paced. Those are the best words that come to mind after I finished re-watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.<br/><br/>This was my first Martin McDonagh film and it encouraged me to check out his two, much better, previous films -- Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges. If you enjoyed the unpredictable storytelling of any one of his films, but have not watched them all, you will also enjoy his unpredictable, unique narrative structure of his other films, which particularly shines in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. His characters are all well-developed, although some are more interesting and watchable than others. Three Billboards is no exception. The story is very smart and serious, even though the screenplay is as hilarious as the subject matter is dark. <br/><br/>Frances McDormand plays Mildred Hayes, a woman grieving after the rape and murder of her daughter. After months of the local police doing nothing for her case, she takes justice into her own hands, first in the form of three billboards calling out the police chief, Woody Harrelson's Chief Willoughby. As the story unravels and the tension builds, the message becomes more and more clear, until it is finally spoken in simple, obvious terms that ruins the subtlety and intelligence of the screenplay. However, the characters are still deep, emotional, and well-developed throughout even when the screenplay falters.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the development and arc of Sam Rockwell's racist police officer, Dixon. At first, he is given the simple, one-dimensional characterization that causes viewers to dismiss him as the villain, or at least an obstacle in the way of the protagonist. Over halfway through, a realization dawns on viewers that sets the stage for the wonderful message: Maybe the hero seeking justice is just as bad as the racist cop. The theme of anger begetting anger is brilliantly told through the characters and their actions in the story. <br/><br/>The setting is also just as important in this movie as many of the characters are. By naming the town fictionally, it is easier to understand how these characters with unrealistic traits and qualities would interact and live in a town like this. Although the characters seem unrealistic, their emotions are certainly real and relatable. McDonagh has a preference for naming his films literally and directly from what the story is about. Ebbing, Missouri is a place of receding hope and grief. In other words, the love, hope, and optimism in Ebbing, Missouri ebbs away as the film progresses and the characters act more and more. . <br/><br/>The largest flaw I have with this film is the pacing of the third act. The first two acts were exceptionally well-made/paced and evoke strong reactions from the audience. Once the majority of the story has been told and the events laid out for us, the film comes screeching to halt, but doesn't end. After the climactic sequence, the story slowly (slower than you can imagine) crawls to its conclusion. As a result, the conclusion leaves viewers thinking, ""Finally!"" where it could have left us thinking that it was shorter than it actually is. To quote Roger Ebert in his A Clockwork Orange review, ""You know there's something wrong with a movie when the last third feels like the last half,"" and those words have never applied to a film more than Three Billboards. <br/><br/>While I still encourage you all to see this (in theaters if possible), it's also important that you know your tastes. If you prefer dark comedy and a subtle, smart story, this is definitely for you. If you hate comedy mixed with serious subject matters and prefer faster-paced films, maybe seek out Dunkirk or Wonder Woman. I also feel that I must admit this: After the Golden Globe awards, I felt highly unsatisfied that Three Billboards won in many major categories and that likely led to me thinking this film is slightly worse than it actually is. While it deserves many of the awards that it has gotten (and is likely to receive), The Shape of Water will always be my favorite of the year, no matter how unpredictable, refreshing, and memorable Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is."

Frances McDormand was excellent as the crazed, grief stricken mother. Woody Harrelson was very good and Peter Dinklage made the most of his couple of scenes. <br/><br/>But really the plotlines were very silly and smashed any semblance of credibility, and in the end that just becomes a distraction.

","Doesn't work as a comedy. You can't expect me to laugh every time someone says a bad word. I'm not ten. Some of the jokes were so cringy i had to walk out of the cinemas. As a drama, the characters aren't fleshed out enough to sell it. Character developmemy is abandoned at the drop of a hat to get a cheap laugh or to propel the plot. This movie leans on the dead girl as a character motivation but we don't learn anything about her except that she fought with her mom that one time. Where the movie meant to out in quirks the result was clumsy cartoonish stereotypes that announced yhemselves as edgy while being old and tired as Dixons mom. The only character i enjoyed watching was Mildreds son - the actor used subtlety and the result was a believable and engaging character.<br/><br/>The movie nodded to several issues of the day including rape in the catholic church and treatment of black people by police, but offers no more than lip service to them. And crimes have no consequence in Missouri apparently.<br/><br/>Also don't just pair off the only two young black people in the movie. They're not a pair of socks. They don't have to get together.

"secondtake","10","9","20","4 March 2018"," A great movie, in many ways flawless
","Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri (2017)<br/><br/> A stunning, moving, funny as heck movie. You almost have to compare it to ""Fargo"" for its depth and wit simultaneously. Both movies dig into a caricatured America, in this case the South (I'm not sure they ever say where, but it feels like Georgia.)<br/><br/> The great character here has to be the woman who pays for ads on billboards, and who drives the plot--Frances McDormand--and who also happens to be the amazing lead in ""Fargo."" Yeah. Here she doesn't quite don a full southern accent the way she became rural Minnesota in a lick, but she's a perfect type, and tough. Around her are the nuanced but funny kinds of people you'd expect, especially a cadre of cops that includes Woody Harrelson, always an asset, this time as an honorable chief of police with cancer.<br/><br/> The third big name is Sam Rockwell, who is terrific as a troubled cop. His role grows as the movie twists. Any scene with McDormand and Harrelson, or with her and Rockwell, is really amazing. Good acting is good acting.
 The script here is great. I think it is the screenplay of the year and should get the Oscar, never mind the fun originality of ""Get Out"" which lacks the subtle insights and natural language here. <br/><br/> There are other levels to love this movie on, from the music (Carter Burwell) to the photography (Ben Davis). Almost no one is a famous contributor beyond the actors, including the director and writer, Martin McDonagh. That's partly what makes it all fresh and honest. 
 It's a great movie. Do not miss it."

What is it with HollyWeird thinking this crap is what we want to watch? That it's somehow representative of Us Still-Evolving Rednecks in middle America? The sneering coastal elitism and over-the-top christianity-vilification is extremely insulting and tiresome. Replace ""The Scene"" in this flick involving Frances' character as a typically-condescending liberal shredding a priest for institutional sexual abuse and replace her entire dialogue with ""hollywood rapists"" vs ""Catholic boys club"" and it would be far FAR more accurate.

","Could have been a good, even an important movie, till the plot completely disintegrated into senseless violence that voided the credibility of the leading characters. Again, reviewers have so lost their sensibility to pornographic violence and believable character development, that I have to be very skeptical of most of them. <br/><br/>This ""scorched earth apocalyptic violence"" is diminishing the value of certain writer/directors such as Taylor Sheridan (Wind River) and Martin McDonagh (Three Billboards), and raising the value of more intelligent and perceptive directors such as Iranian Asghar Farhadi and France's Francois Ozon.<br/><br/>I may sound a little ""wimpish"" like I am in denial of ""reality."" Actually, I would say the opposite, that I am aware and extremely sensitive to the existence of violence and live with the goal of diminishing it and alleviating the pain it causes.<br/><br/>And, I would suggest that the movie directors who continually push the envelope on graphic gore, are not concerned about the reality of violence, but instead are in love with it.

","Let's start with the good: The acting was good. Let's go to the bad: the acting can't save a bad script.<br/><br/>A lot of the writing here is very random and haphazard. The movie starts out pretending to be a mystery movie (whodunnit as some call it), but changes to a redemption story, or maybe a revenge story. Or is it social commentary?<br/><br/>In the end it's neither; the mystery of who killed the protag's daughter isn't resolved, the racist cop hasn't done anything to prove his change of heart, there's no revenge, and the racism theme barely scratches the surface, and is superficial at best. I wouldn't be surprised if the racial angle was thrown in at the last minute of screenplay writing for maximum Oscar bait.<br/><br/>I'm not saying a work of art cannot contain multiple take home messages, but this movie seems to jump to a different direction at every step of the way rather than having overarching themes.<br/><br/>Then there are the actual lines that the actors say. There's a lot of swearing. Like a lot. Not that I'm against that, but that is not how people normally talk. A lot of it is not like how normal people talk. A lot of it is not how people act or react. It seems like the writer is trying to hit as many ""look how taboo breaking my writing is"" check marks as possible into this movie. Over the top profanity? Check. Senseless violence? Check. Crazy co-incidents? Check. As if Tarantino and the Coen brothers had a baby, and that baby is trying to emulate No Country For Old Men. It bears all the marks, but lacks proper context and the script to support it.<br/><br/>Finally, there are instances of Chekhov's Gun all over this film (and badly places ""red herrings""). This 'rule' states that if you place a gun hanging on a wall in a movie scene, it better be used, or don't hang it there at all. Case in point: the weird guy threatening Mildred in her store, the token black people serving no point at all, the divorced husband's new bimbo girlfriend, the midget, and so on. None of these serve an actual purpose to the plot.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to talk about the plot holes. Check any other review under 6 stars for that.<br/><br/>I'm absolutely baffled this movie is as revered as it is. It won Academy Awards. How?? HOW??"

But overall, this was a serious movie regarding a serious topic.<br/><br/>I will say it did keep my interest and from that perspective is a good movie. But it also deviated form reality which is where my disappointment came in. It is one thing to go see an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie where you expect reality to be broken and pushed to the ridiculous (think 'Last Stand'). I expect that from Arnold's movies. But this movie started in a serious note and I expected it to remain believable. For examples, it went off track when the former deputy miraculously recovers in what seemed like a day from his burns. Or the African-American sheriff that comes in and takes over. What did he do and what was the point? And then the fact 'someone' burns down the town's police department headquarters and there appears to be no manhunt to find the culprit. <br/><br/>And this movie also included those subtle intrusions of political/social commentary, which seems like the norm now days (e.g., the black replacement sheriff, the dwarf prejudice, the bad-ass female-mother). <br/><br/>So overall, it was interesting but left me hoping for the better that it could have been.<br/><br/>Oh yea, on another note, then there was the ending....."

","I had extremely high hopes, for this movie. From word-of-mouth, to the success it had at this year's Golden Globes, I was excited to see this. It contained an ensemble cast of actors, whose work I have cherished, and directed by the talented Martin McDonagh!<br/><br/>All was going well until the 45th minute, or so--when the plot and performances began to nosedive (for me). I have genuinely never experienced a situation, like this, previously. The first 45mins are gripping. The performances compelling. The dialogue, raw.<br/><br/>And then...it loses itself. Suddenly, comedy is introduced--and I mean, suddenly. Rockwell's character begins to act in such an overly oafish way. It's cartoonish.<br/><br/>Other characters, who are initially presented as vile, suddenly are portrayed in a more favourable light--but without reason. <br/><br/>Take this example, where McDormand's ex-husband comes back to the home, has a violent & threatening conversation with her. Complete with table flipping, and physical assault--which is only halted when the teenage son puts a knife to the father's throat. High stakes, right? <br/><br/>Then--for some inexplicable reason--it chooses this point in the story, to introduce the husband's new 19-yr old companion. In the middle of this extremely tense scene, suddenly this new character comes in, and provides a comedic foil by using a tired stereotype, of a young lady (pretty, but dumb). <br/><br/>I have never watched a movie while continually muttering ""Oh, please..."", as much as I did, with this one. Like I said...right around the 45min point, the script, plot and performances became a lot less believable.<br/><br/>I will watch anything that McDormand stars in, and to be fair--her performance alone, is compelling.<br/><br/>But I found this movie to be a huge disappointment. It can't decide if it's a drama, a dark comedy, a Cohen Brothers production, or all of the above. It literally felt like they had switched editors, a third into the movie. It's a shame.<br/><br/>POST-SCRIPT:

","Three Bilboards, with a fairly short running time, throws the audience directly into the plot with the opening frames. This film does an excellent job showing both sides, McDormand's character and the general public, equally as they are. A grieving mother seeking justice and answers, and the Chief of Police who feels he's done his job to the best of his ability. McDormand's blunt, rude, vulgar, and uncensored character is extremely charismatic. The other characters (one in particular after some major character development) are very charismatic as well. This film takes the audience on a very dark journey where nothing ""expected"" or ""predictable"" really happens. We become very invested in a brilliant story with direction we are fools to think we can foresee. Viewers will feel a surprising warmth to this dark tale, and find the very shocking (and very common) inappropriate dialog either funny, or just plain wrong.

A typical image of social media's era with #metoo hashtags and many more...

"PyroSikTh","9","7","15","16 January 2018"," Will having you laughing and crying in the same scene.
","In Bruges is quite simply one of the finest movies ever made, managing the difficult task of being rip roaringly hilarious and gut-wrenchingly emotional at the same time, often in the same scenes. This is Martin McDonagh's signature and he's held it through every one of his films. I admit I wasn't so much a fan of Seven Psychopaths (comparatively), but I think I just need to see it again. Nonetheless it didn't squander my anticipation for his next filmmaking adventure; Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which is getting a hell of a lot of Awards attention, and that couldn't make me happier. Three Billboards is quintessential McDonagh; dark, hilarious, emotional, shocking, quotable, filled to the brim with characters that ooze depth and development. It'll have you laughing and crying at the same moment, on the edge of your seat, and wrapped up in the worlds of each individual character and their own personal story.<br/><br/>Three Billboards follows the tale of Mildred who seeks justice seven months after her daughter's rape and murder. Angry at the local police department's perceived lack of action on the case, she buys out three billboards outside her home to call out the sheriff and make her stand. It splits the town, between those who support her, and those who are angered by her actions, and those who just get caught up in the middle, like her son, and the advertising company who owns the billboards.<br/><br/>Mildred is an enthralling character to watch. On the surface she's an extremely unlikeable person. She's brash, angry, foul-mouthed, and lacks any kind of tact. She's so blinded by her own grief and anger that she can't see the effect her actions are taking on those around her, whether those actions are morally or legally right or not. But she is only one of many interesting characters in this movie. Three Billboards only has one, unseen villain; the rapist/murderer, and no heroes to speak of at all. Every character exists in their own spectrum of grey, from Mildred herself, to the angry, racist cop Dixon, to the dying Chief Willoughby, to the unsure of himself, but morally grounded Red. None of them are quintessentially good, and none of them are quintessentially bad; just normal people reacting in sometimes expected and other times unexpected ways, as people do.<br/><br/>I'll skip to the acting now, because that's also such a huge part of these characters. Frances McDormand deserves every accolade she gets over the coming months for her performance as Mildred. In lesser hands Mildred's character could easily have fallen flat, deep in the realms of unsympathetic protagonist, but McDormand takes this woman and makes her so oddly easy to root for. Sam Rockwell is the other standout. I've been singing his praises for years, as he's always the best part of any movie he's in, but as Dixon he's only eclipsed by McDormand. At first a bumbling idiot quick to anger, Rockwell manages to handle the one-eighty with such convincing dignity that it feels natural and real, and that Dixon is still there. He was a smart guy after all, just not very good at communicating. Woody Harrelson is also fantastic as Chief Willoughby, keeping the film firm in it's moral foundations. The supporting cast are all great as well, from Peter Dinklage to John Hawkes to Caleb Landry Jones (who's had a hell of a career so far). The only real weak link is Abbie Cornish who doesn't really know what to do with herself, and whose accent is so bizarrely confusing it's hard to understand where she's meant to be from.<br/><br/>But the exceptional character work is only a part of what makes Three Billboards so good. Narratively McDonagh manages to craft a story full of unpredictable turns without convoluting itself with twists, and never feels the need to answer anything (including a plot-cliffhanger of an ending). The way Three Billboards manages to balance dark, serious, violent, and shocking, with funny, silly, and even a dash of slapstick is fantastic, and there's so many moments that completely subvert expectations. One example is an interrogation between Mildred and Willoughby as they play off one another, brought to a halt by a sudden cough of blood, and the tone just shifts with the click of the finger. Mildred goes from smarmy smartass to mothering human being without missing a step. Another is a sudden escalation of domestic argument that results in a knife to the throat, but is quickly interrupted by an injection of humour from someone walking in unexpected and apologising.<br/><br/>In lesser hands these shift of tones would feel haphazard and jarring, but McDonagh somehow manages to keep it all tied together. It doesn't matter that a serious interaction is interrupted by humour (and vice versa), because everything shifts so quickly. For every line that makes you laugh (""Penelope said begets?""), there's a line that punches you in the gut (""I hope you get raped too""), and it just adds to the unpredictability of the story. There's never a moment that ends exactly the way you think it will.<br/><br/>Three Billboards is definitely a triumph of filmmaking. It's not perfect by any means (Abbie Cornish), but everything it does right, it really does right. Few movies will take you on as much of a rollercoaster as Three Billboards, and fewer still will drive that rollercoaster by characters as deep and interesting as Mildred, Dixon, Willoughby, Red, Robbie, James, and Charlie. The story, the music, the dialogue, the shifts in tone, the acting, the cinematography (that tracking shot, man), it's all fantastic. I give Three Billboards an unquestioning 9/10. What a start to 2018.

","The screenplay of this movie is absolutely stunning. The script handles this mode of tragedy very well but at the same time manages a very intelligent and very well thought comedy. Although some of the characters try to be funny in times of stress and tension, which makes them insignificant in my opinion, the whole cast is amazing, but obviously the most outstanding is Frances McDormand's character. She is an unfiltered psycho who seeks justice for the death of her daughter. She's everything in this film, even her facial expressions are amazing. The film manages a very interesting comedy, for example, Carter Burwell puts a slow music to put you in a sad mood and make you feel for the characters and suddenly... you laugh.

"ElMaruecan82","10","5","10","5 March 2018"," So 'Ebbing' Great!
","Billboards... Ebbing... So many ""B's"" but a B-movie it sure ain't... far from it actually, this is high-level film-making, a movie meaning ""B"" for excellence, B as in Business!<br/><br/>And watching some shots of Frances McDormand driving across some random Missouri road and turning her head to her passenger made me feel I was watching an older -and grouchier- version of her most iconic character Marge Gunderson. That both performances earned her Oscars is no coincidence, she was born to be Marge and Mildred, Mildred Hayes to name her. The traits are more severe-looking, age did alter her woman-next-door charm but there's something in the eyes that left room to a certain gentleness, decency and sense of humor, no matter how twisted it is.<br/><br/>Sense of humor indeed... in a story involving police brutality, racism, and rape, the evil trinity wrapped up into another of these typical atypical Midwest crisis, something you wouldn't believe it was possible before watching Martin McDonagh's acclaimed ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"", the film that came so close to winning the triple crown of Best Pictures yesterday (but took home the right acting Oscars). Yet as horrific and seemingly cynical (seemingly underlined) it is, the film immediately drained from the wells of the Coen brother's masterpiece's memories. If not as close to perfect as ""Fargo"" is, it's as close to cinematic perfection as many recent movies confronted us to, there's just something immensely satisfying about ""Billboards"".<br/><br/>""Fargo"" was crazy, wicked but remember how it ended, Marge was summoning the newly arrested criminal, telling him that there's more to life than money, and he was going to jail on what was a 'beautiful day', the masterpiece of dark humor ended with a light of hope and you could even sense remorse growing in the sociopath's eyes. Just when it became so trendy to have decent characters descending into madness and psychopathy and all the viewers secretly wishing they could loosen up a bit as far as their ethics go, here is a movie where characters start behaving like the bad guys we expect, only to discover that there was something good about them that only waited for the right opportunity to blossom. If that film didn't win the Best Picture Oscar, at least, it shows what ""Crash"" should have been to really deserve it.<br/><br/>""Fargo"" and ""Crash"" weren't the only movie ""Billboards"" reminded me of, there was something in McDormand's wounded soul playing like a reminiscence of Kathy Bates' underrated performance as and in ""Dolores Clairborne"", a Stephen King's story that ventured into similar realms of traumas and vengeance by focusing on the tortured mind of an average woman. The parallel that can be drawn between the two performances (besides the fact that Bates should have been nominated) is the defining line of the film ""Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman's got to hold on to."" That line encompasses every single action of Mildred Hayes, never as an excuse but an explanation. When a mother has her daughter killed, abused and savagely burnt and the investigation leads to nowhere, she can only resort to the bitchiest side of her soul and yes, some wicked sense of humor... as the billboards would be referred to as a 'joke' by one of the main concerned people, and not in a condescending way.<br/><br/>So how about the infamous billboards? These three unused things of the 80's in a road nobody takes, and the opportunity to 'create a buzz', at a time where Internet, twitter, Facebook attracted every attention-whore of the world, here's one hell of a clever use of medium, anachronistic, inventive (screenplay-wise very clever but wouldn't you expect that from the writer director of ""In Bruges"") and the starter of a chain of events that will challenge and tease all your expectations. Because it's not much the set-up that ""Billboards"" establishes which is its main strength but how it plays with it, toying in the process with what we would expect after watching ""Fargo"", ""Crash"" or ""August Osage County"". The film opens with a hardened Midwest divorced mother, a worn-out but benevolent Chief of Police targeted by the billboards played by Woody Harrelson, a redneck deputy played by the great Sam Rockwell, so many characters' tropes in a nutshell that end up being totally deconstructed, for moments of laughs, shock and some heights of emotionality you never expect (not from 'these' characters anyway).<br/><br/>And it's all in the deconstruction that ""Billboards"" work, McDonagh has just a way to make the story advances so that once you think you spotted a contrivance or felt something was going in the predictable Aesopian-arc way that the film takes a detour into a twist you didn't see while maintaining its plausibility and revealing a higher esteem on humanity. This is a journey whose starting point is a horrific act of barbarity and ending up with 'bad' people realizing that deep inside there's more room for decency than they would believe... and people who realize that just because they defend a noble cause, aren't immune to punctual bits of vileness. Now, that's challenging. And later, the film takes another path that leaves the perfect cloud of uncertainty, but I'll stop here because this is one experience I don't want to spoil, just enjoy ""Billboards"", it is THAT good.<br/><br/>The film is served by great performances, besides Oscar-winning McDormand and Rockwell, there's also Peter Dinklage who has a great shining moment and there's the so underrated Woody Harrelson who always hit the right note between pathos and humor and the neutered tone of the man who starts to take things seriously, just like this movie does but not without a level of edgy self-awareness that makes the whole thing oddly entertaining no matter how dark it is. Really, one of a kind!"

","I just saw this movie, and I found it remarkable. Yes, there is some very fine acting in it, which I will leave to others to praise. What I found remarkable here was the script, not the dialogues so much as the plot development. There are several surprise developments, twists and turns that catch you - or at least me - of your guard. But they never struck me as forced, they always made sense within the context of what had come before. The lead characters were allowed a complexity that I appreciated.<br/><br/>There was one thing that left me perplexed: deputy Dixon's change of character near the end, when he decides to help the main character find her daughter's sadistic killer. Yes, I know that he is affected by the late sheriff's letter to him - did the sheriff really write all those letters before committing suicide? - but that didn't seem enough to me. I was amazed that, when Dixon finally sees the fire engulfing the police station, the one thing he wants to save is the file regarding the daughter's murder case.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to hear how others reacted to this."

","Saw 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' on the promise of one of the year's best trailers, the immensely talented cast, the intriguing subject matter, the receiving and pending of numerous accolades and being familiar with Martin McDonagh's previous work. <br/><br/>On the most part 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' was incredibly well done. Understandably it is not for all. The film has already been criticised for implausibility, bigotry, the ending and its lack of character likeability and over-the-top actions, though often without acknowledging the film's many strengths and resorting to condescension (a big bugbear of mine) towards people who liked it let alone loved it. <br/><br/>Did have a couple of issues with 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' myself. The ending is far too abrupt and without resolution in a film crying out for one. <br/><br/>Epileptics should beware too of a dizzyingly edited attempted murder scene, understand why it was edited that way but will admit that it did make me feel ill watching it (luckily it quickly passed). <br/><br/>Abbie Cornish felt out of place here, she doesn't have a lot to do (not enough to single handedly ruin the film, she would have to have a far more major role to do that) but everything about her just jarred. <br/><br/>There are some implausible behaviours and consequences, Dixon's actions were more than just a sackable offense for instance.<br/><br/>However, there is so much to like about 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'. With the sole exception of Cornish, who isn't in it enough to ruin the film, the acting is brilliant. Frances McDormand's performance is a career high and one of the year's best, very heartfelt and fiery, even if you don't condone some of her actions it is hard not to feel for her as she goes through every mother's worst nightmare. Woody Harrelson is heart-breaking and has the film's most sympathetic character perhaps (either he or Peter Dinklage's, although Dinklage doesn't have the film's most tragic scene). <br/><br/>Sam Rockwell is similarly a revelation, you initially dislike his character but later on his 180 is incredibly moving and he is the character who changes and redeems the most. Peter Dinklage always makes anything better and it's the same here just by his presence alone and his performance is the most likeable one, especially towards the end where one actually feels sorry for him. <br/><br/>Another standout is the writing, do not let the heavy use of profanity put you off. There are parts that are darkly comic and induce a number of chuckles and laugh out louds. The film also works as being one that is morally nuanced and complex, the characters are not ""likeable"" ones, neither were they intended to be, and make questionable decisions but they undergo changes that sees them in a different perspective (Dixon especially). <br/><br/>A large part of me found it difficult to not relate to Mildred, her actions are extreme at times but there are parents in the same situation that feel similarly seeing as grief is an incredibly powerful and complex emotion. It's the tragic elements that resonate most though, with its heavy going themes handled very poignantly and harrowingly. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' has a story that is deliberate but also gripping, with an adept balance of its varied tones. Which is why it is sad that it ends as unsatisfyingly as it does. <br/><br/>With the exception of one scene, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is succinctly edited and grittily and beautifully shot. McDonagh directs very skilfully. Carter Burwell's music score fits perfectly and is a hypnotic, understated and melancholic score in its own right. Just as fitting in a somewhat ironic way is the use of the gorgeous ""Last Rose of Summer"" exquisitely sung by Renee Fleming, whose voice one familiar with and loves classical music and opera (like me) recognises from anywhere. <br/><br/>Overall, gripping and very well done film if not perfect. The performances are among the best of the year especially but the film itself as an overall whole just falls a tad short of being one of the year's best films. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"kojimasrasengan","10","5","10","3 February 2018"," An Excellent Piece About Loss and Revenge
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is quite simply one of, if not the best film of 2017. It rivals Blade Runner 2049 in sheer greatness. There were so many moments in Three Billboards that genuinely surprised me. It was truly refreshing seeing a movie as unpredictable as Three Billboards. Perhaps the best part of the film, however, are the characters. The performances from pretty much all of the actors in this movie are fantastic. Frances McDormand gives an absolutely spectacular performance in this film (Probably the best performance of her career). And Of course, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, and Caleb Landry Jones were fantastic in this movie as well. However, there is one actor in this film who did pretty poorly in my opinion, which was Lucas Hedges. His performance was pretty bad in this film, but luckily he really wasn't an important character, so his performance didn't hinder my overall thoughts of the film. But it's not just the performances that really make these characters great; the way these characters are written is absolutely genius! I genuinely cared about every character in this film. There were some characters that I never expected to care about and sympathize with by the end of it. Each character has a brilliantly written arc that blends perfectly with the pace of the film. Three Billboards is a film worthy of the Oscar it is nominated for. I highly encourage you to go see this movie as soon as you can, before it stops showing in theaters. It is truly a film worth seeing on the big screen."

","There is something about this film that I really love but I can't point out.<br/><br/>The acting? Frances McDormand is a wonderful and a compelling actress and man I got won over by Sam Rockwell's convincing acting which got me love-hate him. And poor me, I didn't even know who they were before this one.<br/><br/>Perhaps the senseless direction of the plot and the underdeveloped characters? If you really think about it, the story was going nowhere. All you got a bunch of characters who never seem to get what they want. We got characters that fight their own battles. A mother who seeks justice for her child, a cop who still lives with his domineering mother, a chief who is pressured to finish an unresolved case knowing that he is dying, and bunch of other ideas of a character that seem to show up and disappear. <br/><br/>Maybe everything about this film fit perfectly for me. The screenplay, the direction and cinematography, the overall production.<br/><br/>Should I get mad that the film failed to highlight the struggles of minorities? That there are misogynistic and racist characters? Am I stupid if I say no?<br/><br/>Reality is, people are racist, the justice system is flawed, grief makes people do crazy things, hate is everywhere, love always gives and doesn't demand, some families are dysfunctional, forgiveness is not everything, and answers aren't always available no matter how we demand it. This movie is a reflection of these things. People are flawed and we all go through hard times and we fight different battles and despite this, there is a glimmer of goodness within us.<br/><br/>Not everything has to be politically correct to be sensible. At the very least, shoving political correctness up on everybody's asses is preposterous at a time like this in my honest opinion."

"maurice_yacowar","10","5","10","24 November 2017"," Mother of raped and murdered daughter campaigns to revive her case.
","The film is framed by different forms of blankness. The first shot is of the three shredded and dilapidated billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. Each is a fragmented ruin of a past life and meaning — like the characters we meet later. <br/><br/>In the last the screen is filled with Mildred and Dixon driving to Idaho either to kill or not to kill the rapist who threatened Mildred in her shop, then later beat up Dixon in the bar. He has described having raped someone — presumably while on duty in the Middle East — but it wasn't her daughter. <br/><br/>Their decision remains unknown, a blank, but it doesn't matter. These former antagonists are at last united, despite her having started the fire that scarred him and his former brutality as a cop.<br/><br/>The subject of the film is how Mildred and the billboards bring each other back to life. She revives them as a ploy to pressure Sheriff Willoughby to move on her raped and killed daughter's case. That initiative also returns her to a renewed purpose in life. <br/><br/>Her moral revival spreads to Dixon, when Willoughby's letter to him encourages a new self- respect and a check on his violent rage. <br/><br/>It's not just the town that's ebbing. Life, hope, community, self-respect, all seem sapped from the characters whether directly or indirectly affected by the young girl's murder.<br/><br/>The four main women provide an interesting antithesis. Mildred's ex's 19-year old girlfriend and adman Red Wilby's secretary are two perky ditzes edging into the world of experience. At the other extreme Mildred and Dixon's mother are hard cases, forged by experience into an indomitable will. <br/><br/>In the middle stands Willoughby's pretty young widow, blessed with a loving husband and two delightful daughters but dashed by her husband's cancer and suicide. Her unintentionally cruel confrontation of Mildred shows her strain and insecurity. <br/><br/>The Peter Dinklage character James is a dignified counterpoint to the variously swaggering ex and Dixon — and at its worst, the soldier rapist. James is a comic replay of the sheriff's integrity and character.<br/><br/>This black, salty comedy is distinguished by the range of quirky characters, the brilliant offbeat dialogue and the complexity of characterization. Dixon's first conversation with the sign-man is a Beckettian (or Abbott and Costello) piece of classic non-communication. Mildred may check her children's obscenity but spews inspired herself.<br/><br/>And everyone has a backstory. Mildred's ex may seem a pathetic wife-beater turned cradle-robber but he's also in his own way trying to come to terms with his daughter's loss. Unable to cede Mildred any ground, he burns down her billboards. <br/><br/>Mildred seems driven by maternal devotion — but she's haunted by guilt, after her quarrel with her daughter sent her off to her doom. Her son is twice torn — between needing to turn away from his sister's loss and his mother's obsession with it and between his warring parents. <br/><br/>Even the buffoonish Dixon musters our sympathy when we learn his rage dates back to his father's death. So does his dependence on his mother. To get his suspect's DNA he invites a physical beating as if to atone for his own violence before. There's a double redemption and reconciliation when his own victim Red brings him an orange juice in the hospital. <br/><br/>Sheriff Willoughby is our first and presiding case of redemptive revelation. Foul-mouthed and angry at the interruption of his Easter dinner, he proves a loving father and husband. His suicide note to his wife turns the hellish world we've been watching into the heaven he has found in his family. <br/><br/>If we start with Mildred's view of the incompetent lazy sheriff, we're turned by his brave handling of his cancer, especially when Mildred comforts his eruption. He embraces Mildred by paying the next month's fee for the billboards embarrassing him. His note to Dixon confirms our sense of an honourable man caught in a dilemma beyond his easy solution, but simply trying to do the best he can. For everyone."

","Questions and accusations go hand in hand when everyone knows everyone. Mildred has thrown up a three-part whooper of an interrogative just on the outskirts of town, just so any newcomers are privy to the neglect that burns through her faded, but defiant jumpsuit.<br/><br/>The billboards' target lands on Chief Willoughby, a rugged yet compassionate family man, who loves saying ""goddamn"", and his force provides all the opportunities to pull it out. A man capable of viewing the larger picture in a speck of a town, he spatters red in attempts to wipe the advertising demons out of mind. <br/><br/>Mildred has always spoken with her hands, and the moment she once spoke spiteful words haunts her to this day. Holy men, and blue men have no chance of cooling her. They are all culpable for the breakfast silences and cereal fights. Her son, Robbie, writhes in discomfort as she disregards reputation with crotch kicks and viral marketing.<br/><br/>Officer Dixon is more of a short fuse than a racist, but particular sins float to the surface. His actions are deplorable, yet his heart rests in his momma's lap. He is the canine companion of Willoughby, and acts in contradiction to the Chief's every command. This zealot disciple might just be an incarnate desire emerging from a red wall. <br/><br/>The inter-connectivity of small town living makes for scolding tempers and egregious lack of judgments. When a big city crime creeps into their preservation, Ebbing inhabitants end up making unlikely friends and easy enemies. Arson becomes untraceable, but the motive is as clear as the pain of a lost child, or perhaps husband.<br/><br/>McDonagh has wrangled his wacky surrealism into a heart-stabbing community drama complete with genuine surprises and courageous late chapter restraint. Falling in love with the most slimy characters reveals how truly empathetic his vision was in creating a mystery with no clues and only heartache and growth."

","""Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness."" - MLK Jr.<br/><br/>It is perhaps the most sentient lesson one can take from Three Billboards Outsie Ebbing, Missouri. The darkest film of 2017. A film so unrelentingly angry and brutal, that it laughs in self-awareness and asks the audience to do the same. Not a single person in this film is likable, by any stretch. Not a single line of dialogue is delivered with the premise of you bursting out laughing. Three Billboards is what it is. Unapologetically politically incorrect and gritty. Martin McDonagh piles it all on high like a plate at Thanksgiving dinner (to make a timely reference). But consequently, it gives the film a charm of it's own and a poignancy that is unmistakable. Reminiscent of the great films of the Coen Bros. and Quentin Tarantino, Three Billboards takes itself as far as it can go down the dark comedy rabbit hole and you will be smitten by that instantly. Three Billboards is a remarkable film and the most memorable film I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand, in what can only be described as her most commanding on-screen performance since Fargo, plays Mildred Hayes. The grieving, blisteringly vengeful mother of a young girl raped and murdered by an unknown psychopath. In righteous indignation, she rents out Three billboards, that just so happen to be outside of Ebbing, Missouri (as the title suggests), that bluntly criticize the police department of Ebbing for what she sees as incompetence. ""Raped while dying,"" ""And still no arrests,"" ""How come, Chief Willoughby?"" they read. Chief Willoughby, played by Woody Harrelson, takes offense by the billboards as he feels it unfairly targets him, especially coming on the heels of his cancer diagnosis. Backed up in outraged is Officer Jason Dixon, played by Sam Rockwell, in a role that seems tailor made for a young Michael Rooker . Officer Dixon is the world's stupidest cop and the most bigoted for sure. As time goes on, the outrage comes to ahead when a new specific tragedy (that I won't spoil) happens to Chief Willoughby. Defiant, Mildred insists that the billboards stay up. The tables have turned for Dixon, who now has a righteous anger of his own. Desperate for revenge, he tries to get back at Mildred, only to reap what he has sowed, by chance, in a Molotov cocktail attack on the police station. Also, by sheer chance, he runs into who he thinks is the killer of Mildred's daughter and to atone for his bad cops sins, tries his best to indite the SOB.<br/><br/>What is this movie getting at? A simple tale of the madness of current American society at it's core. Nobody is ever who they seem and we all aren't perfect. Also, how fate can change lives and the perspectives of themselves and others on a dime. Furthermore, tragedy and hate tend to become vicious cycles, as we all like to blame some kind of scapegoat to heal ourselves. It never does. Three Billboards cuts deep, even as it takes itself not very seriously... or so we think? The characters all curse up a storm and beat each other up, yet they all cry real tears. Can a film this strange make you feel the feels? The answer is it does. By some miracle, it does."
"PotassiumMan","9","5","10","12 November 2017"," Darkly comic morality tale, and one that deserves respect
","Many have referred to McDonagh's film as a black comedy and it does have a lot of grim humor. But it's also a film about grief, revenge and ultimately about doing right by others. Harsh is the most apt way to describe the film's mentality. Nobody emerges from this story pure. You will come away battle-scarred but also grateful at having absorbed a refreshingly blunt take on human nature. I wish I could say more, but this is a film where one should go in knowing as little as possible, as I did.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand absolutely shines as the mother of a murdered teenage girl. She has watched for months as the police department in her local town has not come up with any arrests. She takes matters into her own hands by putting up billboards demanding answers from the authorities. From there on, the town swells into a maelstrom of rancor, vendetta, recrimination and, if I gave away more it would spoil too much. Sam Rockwell is equally impressive as the dim-witted cop with supposedly little self-discipline and a short fuse. And Woody Harrelson is great as the highly-regarded police chief who suddenly finds a roiling controversy on his hands.<br/><br/>In terms of cinema embracing a dark, cynical point of view, this is the hardest film I've seen since ""Nightcrawler"". It takes its bleak view of the world and splashes it all over the screen from start to finish. There are scarce moments of rejuvenation and optimism. For the most part, the film revels in its dark sarcasm all the while keeping the audience guessing about the its resolution and making no guarantees. The themes of grief and anger at the system's lack of results and thus taking matters into one's own hands are powerfully rendered here. The sense of victimhood takes a back seat to up-from-the-bootstraps empowerment. Love it or hate it, this film makes its points with conviction and sincerity, however rough around the edges. Strongly recommended."
"bastille-852-731547","7","5","10","11 November 2017"," McDonagh Delivers Another Well-Made Dark Comedy
","Martin McDonagh's new film is an incendiary dark comedy that has some tonal similarities with his two previous films, ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths."" However, this film is also plenty unique, and while not perfect, it's a wickedly thoughtful while also somber film due to its plot and general merits. The film tells the story of a woman in a small town in Missouri who puts up three billboards to depict her disapproval of the local police chief's failure to investigate her daughter's rape and murder. Gleefully profane and politically incorrect, the film's no-holds-barred script generally works to create dramatic irony, tension and a sense of collective outrage. However, there are a few moments where its more hyperbolic senses fail to create the intended effect on viewers--or come across as if such writing devices are simply trying too hard to do so. <br/><br/>""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" should be commended for its exceptional acting. Frances McDormand's performance in the lead role is simply outstanding. She manages to pull off a genuine sense of grief combined with a twisted and engaging sense of humor that complements her otherwise-serious characterization quite well. The supporting cast is impressive as well, particularly Woody Harrelson's role as the police chief. Despite these unique strengths, the film does also contain some flaws. The climax and ending happen to go on too long for no particular reason, and there are portions of the film that do feel slightly atonal. However, this is a generally well-made and certainly well-acted dark comedy. Recommended. 7.5/10"

"RforFilm","10","6","13","18 January 2018"," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a prime example of a character study and why crime is rarely black and white
","In most crime cases, there are not just two, but many sides to the story. Let's say a thief was caught steeling someone's wallet. The victim and the police would agree that what he did was wrong and was damaging to the owner. The thief, in return, may say that he's dirt broke with a starving child and only needed a few extra dollars for some food. Are any of these people in the wrong? Yes and no. It all depends on the people and what it is their doing. A stolen wallet case is a simple wrongdoing, but what about an emotional scaring murder?<br/><br/>In the case of a movie like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, we get the case of a death of a teenager, and yet the scene was so clean that the authorities are hard pressed to even go after any suspects. So her mother decides to take action. Now what she does paints one picture about how the response has been. yet we do get another side about the complications about following the rules and not wanting to make false assumptions. So let's see how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri looks at it's though situation.<br/><br/>Single mother Mildred (played by Francis McDormand) is grieving over the loss of her teenage daughter Angela who was killed, raped, and burned. The local authorities have been investigating to find the culprits, but have yet to find any good leads. Having run out of patience, Mildred rents three billboards on a rural road with each one saying ""RAPED WHILE DYING"", ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS"", and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?"". This draws immediate attention from the locals whose reaction is quite negative. Mildred's son Robbie (played by Lucas Hedges) doesn't like the attention, her ex husband Charlie (played by John Hawkes) is furious, and the majority of the town sides with the chief.<br/><br/>Chief Willoughby (played by Woody Harrelson) is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration and even talks with her about his complications and how he's suffering from pancreatic cancer (the reason the town is siding with him). She nevertheless keeps the billboards going, which only make town folk even angrier. She and her son are harassed and she even attacks her dentist when things get violent. It doesn't help that fellow officer Dixon (played by Sam Rockwell) is high tempered, not that bright, and takes the billboards as a personal insult. <br/><br/>I find it amazing that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was not based on any incident and is an original story. It feels like something that could have happened, because of the characters involved. It would have been easy to make this story a corrupt police and show Mildred as a hero, but like that TV show Game of Thrones, almost everyone here is within a gray area. Including Mildred and Chief Willoughby, they have their strength, but heavy flaws that don't just affect the case, but their own lives. This is another example of a character study.<br/><br/>Because this is a movie that relies on it's characters, the actors are phenomenal. Francis McDormand plays a woman who had already had life beaten her down, but with that extra death on her conscience, makes her a storm cloud of angst. She carries a lot of stress, but also seems to believe she has nothing more to lose. Sam Rockwell plays a different kind of...stupid that you don't see too often. He's in his own lazy bubble with the concept that as long as things stay status quo, then he'll be fine. As the movie goes further, you see everything he understands falls apart and what that does to his personality.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten red billboards out of ten. Sorry that the review is short, but there's a lot in this movie I cannot give away. It's an engaging story that's not even much of a mystery. It's a character-driven drama at heart and knows how their actions will dictate the plot. Go see Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and understand why even with all sides of the story on the table, it's hard to tell whose right."

","You couldn't get more mid-American than Missouri. You'd be forgiven for not knowing that the state capital is Jefferson City. It's an unremarkable state and Ebbing is an unremarkable town (made up it would seem); it's not trailer trash, it's not deep south. It's just a nondescript, middle-class, American provincial town frequented by the usual mish-mash of not quite Hillbillys, not quite racists. They'd have voted for Trump in big numbers; if the place existed.<br/><br/>It's here that Frances McDormand (just like in the unremarkable town of Fargo) stakes her claim for a place at the top table in the pantheon of greatest living actresses.<br/><br/>It's here that Martin McDonagh cements his position as the greatest living comedy writer. (As if In Bruges wasn't enough, he's got his theatre canon of work to bolster those credentials - The Beauty Queen of Leenane and The Lieutenant of Inishmore are both comedic masterpieces.)<br/><br/>And it's here that both Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson put in career defining (and probable Oscar winning) performances.<br/><br/>To say that Frances McDormand has everything you need to be the complete actress is an understatement; she's hilarious, brutal, droll, moving, sympathetic, antagonistic, bombastic, arrogant, crazy, vulnerable, arch, facetious and deadpan. And that's only in the first 20 minutes. This will unquestionably win her, her second Oscar.<br/><br/>And Martin McDonagh will pick up his second for best original screenplay (14 years after winning best short in 2004) and maybe even his third for best director. He already has no fewer than four (yes 4) nominations at the BAFTA's and I expect him to win at least half of them - because this is writing and direction of the very highest order. <br/><br/>He's moved on since In Bruges. Sure the C bomb is dropped very early in the first dialogue scene and turns up several times more. But this is not the full pelt filth that Colin Farrell deployed to intense pleasure in the former.<br/><br/>This is a subtler, equally dark but even more brutal exposition. Each word seems to have been crafted on a lathe. I gasped several times at the sheer dexterity of his writing delivered by masters of their craft.<br/><br/>There's a dwarf, yes. <br/><br/>There's an idiot, yes.<br/><br/>But I ain't telling you no more than that. I saw it without spoilers so you deserve the same respect.<br/><br/>It has a breathtakingly bold finish, I'll tell you that; spoiling nothing.<br/><br/>This is cinema at its absolute finest.

","I went to see ""Billboards"" solely because of the great Frances McDormand.(Guess I'll never forget ""Fargo"") Naturally she was simply tremendous in ""Billboards"",could win Best Actress while cussing with ""effing"" everything in sight with particular emphasis on Willoughby played by another tremendous talent, Woody Harrelson. Oh by the way, this film could cop the Best Picture Oscar but certainly not in my book. The problem is this: although the story is good, the film's tedious to watch. Mighty boring at times.Way too slow moving for me. So if you see it and like it, please don't go after my tail. Thank you for your time reading my review. Bye for now. rickscafe419"
"jadepietro","10","6","13","25 November 2017"," A Great Film about Anger and Grief
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆☆ out of 5) <br/><br/>GRADE: A- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Three of the year's best performances in one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: A grieving mother angers a town in order to seek justice for her daughter's unsolved murder.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: When one glances at Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), it is hard to ever imagine if this woman ever danced, or smiled, or loved someone. One wonders if she ever was an innocent child growing up. Her constant scowl, disdaining look, and furrowed brow, are all evident from a lifetime of disappointments which show us that here is a most unhappy person.<br/><br/>￼But her appearance tells a deeper story... a tragic tale that gives her permission to be filled with hopelessness and a justifiable reason for her rage. Seven months ago, her daughter was raped and savagely murdered and her killer still remains at large. Justice has not been served and now she must intervene in Martin McDonagh's dark comedy, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Leasing a trio of outdoor displays, she will force local law enforcement into solving her daughter's killing by announcing their ineptitude and shaming the town in the process as the situation becomes even more violent as the investigation spins out of control. The film is superb.<br/><br/>￼Just as the morning fog rolls in like a shroud of ominous foreboding, so does a nagging sense of dread and melancholia which seems to hang onto this town and its inhabitants. Mr. McDonagh serves as director and screenwriter and has created a work of art. He deftly directs his own screenplay with masterful results, blending humor and dramatic tension seamlessly. <br/><br/>The director / screenwriter's unique and slightly quirky vision fills his film with poetic images (a teddy bear slightly submerged by a riverbank, a deserted set of red swings gently moving in the breeze, a box turtle crawling over a sleeping woman, three disintegrated billboard alongside an empty road). His dialog is hauntingly real and filled with confrontational conversations and barbed words. There are scenes of unexpected poignancy (one between Ms. M. and a passing deer near those controversial billboards and another involving a conversation between pink bunny slippers that are heartbreaking) Each and every character, from major to minor, are fully drawn and react with complete honesty and quiet (and sometimes loud) rage.<br/><br/>The casting is flawless. Frances McDormand is a commanding presence and makes an indelible impression as a woman on the verge. Overcome with bitterness and grief, she dominates this film with a no-holds-bar persona. The actress plays this unlikable but passionate character with a vengeance, literally speaking. She is simply astonishing. Her portrayal is a master class in acting. Even when not ranting against the powers that be or fighting to simply be heard, Mildred's silent pauses and side glances fill in all of the nuances of her character's emotional breakdown to chilling effects. (If there is any justice, on screen or off, the Oscar is waiting for her.)<br/><br/>As Mildred's moving targets are Woody Harrelson who brings a nuanced portrayal as William Willoughby, the chief of police and Sam Rockwell playing his dim-witted, loyal, and anger-ridden deputy, Officer Dixon. Mr. Harrelson plays the film's most centered character in a town filled with hate and bigotry and the actor conveys a good man dying of cancer, frustrated by life's limitations and caught in a free fall of emotions. Mr. Rockwell takes his complicated character into areas of comedy and drama that defy description. It is a commanding performance as we watch his character grow from a bigoted mama's boy into a man finally questioning his own self-worth. (Another possible award winning performance in a film filled with great acting?) <br/><br/>Adding even more depth to the complex plotting are Lucas Hedge as Mildred's forgotten and emotionally trampled son, Robbie, and John Hawkes as her abusive ex-husband. Only Peter Dinklage's character is a tad sketchy and in need of more screen time. He becomes her possible love interest...if Mildred could possibly love anyone. Providing fine support in minor but pivotal roles are Zeljko Ivanek, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Clarke Peters, and Samara Weaving.<br/><br/>Production values are high. Beautifully filmed by cinematographer Ben Davis, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. uses a variety of musical genres, from opera and pop standards to twangy country tunes, which set that perfect tone in Carter Burwell's atmospheric score. Both words and image create a shattering look at grief that is unmistakably heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some illogical plot twists and sudden far-fetched acts of violence that never have any legal repercussion on the culprits in this community of law and disorder. But the script has such a lyrical and moving way of expressing the everyday sadness and routine of life that is so commonplace in many rural towns. <br/><br/>Some moviegoers also may not be satisfied with the film's conclusion either. But I was transfixed throughout this film. It is hard to imagine another film this year that is so well conceived and executed in its narrative storytelling, sensitive direction, and its glorious acting.<br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the year's best."
"lfoggini","2","7","16","20 January 2018"," An abysmal problematic poorly written film, reminiscent of Crash (2004) in its racism
","This film is a mess. Frances McDormand carries this whole film on her back and yet her character is a complete caricature. She wears the same blue coveralls for the entire film and her anger is so heightened that she can be very accurately likened to Charles Bronson from Death Wish. She is not a character and McDormand imbues the only scrap of interest to be had in this film herself with absolutely no help from the preachy wheedling script. This is to say that she is not compelling and her righteous motherly rage is reduced to a tasteless hyper-violent farce with a ghastly rape as a catalyst for this pisspoor plot. No character motivation makes sense after the first third of the film. Why the hell does Sam Rockwell's character (an awful one-note performance by the way) not get immediately thrown in jail for throwing Caleb Landry Jones out a window? Why are we treated to the trite final moments of Woody Harrelson's one-dimensional lovable country hunk cop only to learn that he paid off the money needed to keep the billboards smearing his name standing? Why is a cartoonish racist cop (Sam Rockwell) the hero of film and completely redeemed of his grotesque racism and habit of torturing black people by deciding to limply and moronically seek out McDormand's daughters killer all because he reads a motivational letter written for no apparent reason by Woody Harrelson who while alive does nothing but berate Rockwell for being a total dunderhead? Oh and he gets handed a glass of orange juice by Caleb Landry Jones so he immediately becomes a good guy. Also how do you extract an accurate sample of DNA out from under your fingernails as Sam Rockwell does, scratching a suspect and in turn getting the shit beaten out of him? Could he perhaps just take the saliva from the rapist's beer bottle after the braggadocios rapist leaves? Martin McDonagh is clearly an awful screenwriter, as his Crash-esque racist white cop redemption is hammered home with a completely unrealistic amount of suffering doled out for Rockwell, who ultimately is the star of this dumpster fire. McDormand is peripheral ultimately and her anguish feels like the object of a joke, as if McDonagh is sneering at her pain with on the nose scenes like the one where we see McDormand's final conversation with her daughter which literally ends with her yelling, ""I hope you get raped!"" Subtlety, very tact. 
This movie is also incredibly problematic. The African-American actors Darrell Britt-Gibson, Clarke Peters, and Amanda Warren are given no compelling characterization and are used as a backdrop. Clarke Peters's Abercrombie exists only to counter the racism of Rockwell and Amanda Warren's Denise exists only to get thrown in jail for fabricated charges, only to emerge all smiles despite McDormand being responsible for this. Also there is an unbelievably cringey scene in which McDormand repeatedly goads Sam Rockwell by saying the n-word. Everybody laughed in the theater but it was completely forced and unfunny and only highlighted McDonagh's treatment of Rockwell's racism as a character quirk as opposed to as a rottenness. And don't get me started on the godawful ending in which McDormand and burnt racist cop drive into the sunset to kill a completely random rapist? Where is the logic there? There is none, no believable motivation anywhere in this godawful film. This really is 2017's version of Crash."

","Two of the finest dark comedies released in the past 20 years have included ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths"" both of these films were written and directed by Martin Mcdonagh. 5 years after his release of ""Seven Psychopaths"" Martin Mcdonagh has released ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing Missouri"" another perfect black comedy filled with a a lovable but flawed cast of characters.<br/><br/>""In Three Billboard Outside of Ebbing Missouri"" Frances McDormand plays a mother named Mildred who desperately wants justice for her daughter who was raped and murdered. She decides to take action into her own hands by putting up three very abrasive Billboards that criticize the cops who failed to solve this case. In doing this Mildred angers many cops and citizens including Sam Rockwell's Dixon and Woody Harrellson's Willoughby in the small town of Ebbing Missouri leading to torment that can be humorous at times while also being darkly disturbing.<br/><br/>Three Billboards succeeds at everything it sets off to do. The one thing it succeeds at the most, however, is the introduction of the huge ensemble cast in a fluid and natural way. Each one of the characters has been fully developed in a satisfying way leading to redemption in some cases and tragedy in others. The main reason this development works so well is the performances. Frances McDormand is fantastic as Mildred and makes you feel the desperation, and regret every time she is on screen. Sam Rockwell is FANTASTIC as the dim-witted corrupt cop Dixon. Rockwell's performance offers a huge amount of comedy while also offering some the most disturbing moments in the film. Woody Harrellson Peter Dinklage and Lucas Hedges all also do a fantastic job in the film.<br/><br/>The Cinematography was stellar, it fills the small town of Ebbing Missouri with life and beauty. There is one stellar one shot in the film that never shies away from the horrific event that is occurring on screen.<br/><br/>All in All ""Three Billboard Outside of Ebbing Missouri"" is a funny dark ride that pays off in every way because of the great acting by every member of the ensemble cast and the direction by Martin Mcdonagh"

"Nathan_Needs_A_Username","9","3","5","6 April 2019"," Movie Review: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
","Three Billboards is equal parts heartbreaking and hilarious. The screenplay moves seamlessly between gut wrenching moments of human weakness and suffering to perfectly timed dark comedy. Frances Mcdormand leads an air tight cast playing a woman who would do anything to have her story told, every moment of her performance feels real and she captures the vulnerability of the character brilliantly. Woody Harrelson is extremely likeable throughout the film in one of his most engaging roles to date and Sam Rockwell completely transforms into a racist, brutal and incredibly stupid cop nailing both the humour and unexpected heart behind the character. The cast is by far the best thing about this movie and it is well worth checking out just to see these amazing actors take on a really great script."
"gbill-74877","6","3","5","29 August 2018"," Entertaining, but flawed
","There is so much pent-up rage over the handling of rape, and police behavior in general, that I think Frances McDormand's character in this film really struck a chord with people. She's on a crusade for her daughter who was raped and killed, and yet no progress has been made in the investigation. She doesn't care who she offends, she won't be intimidated into silence, and she'll stand up for herself in some violent ways. In an interesting twist, the police chief (Woody Harrelson) has pancreatic cancer, so aside from being called out on his investigation, he's dealing with that. The scene McDormand and Harrelson have in an interrogation room, and a specific moment of that is easily the film's best. Harrelson provides a voice of wisdom in the film, and the three letters he pens are also quite touching. There is humor as well, in just how boneheaded one of the policemen (Sam Rockewell) is, and the gem of a moment when Peter Dinklage, otherwise largely wasted, utters the line ""Penelope said 'begets'?"", in a subtle burn of the 19-year-old now dating McDormand's ex-husband.<br/><br/>The film started strong, but along the way started losing me. It suffers artistically from a lack of restraint, and everything seems exaggerated. The profanity. The characters, who start becoming cartoonish. The level of violence. The coincidences. It seems to me that McDonagh's writing is a real issue here. Her last words to her daughter were ""I hope you get raped,"" really? To leave that in the script is egregiously bad, and an insult to the viewer's intelligence. The Molotov cocktails, really? The guy being in the station to begin with, and of course wearing ear buds, really? A man thrown out of a window, and no arrest, really? And on and on, until an ending which is pretty awful if you think about it. It's just tough to appreciate the message of the film or its cast in light of all this. It was entertaining to watch, but in my humble opinion, not worthy of all the acclaim."

"mujohaso","2","3","5","11 April 2018"," Has everyone gone off the deep end?!?
","In what universe is this movie great. Its a mess, plot wise, character wise, acting is horrible and it is the opposite of character study or evolution.
So many thing to choose from but the main things that are most wrong are the things that are most praised by critics. The acting for example. You can PLAINLY see Rockwell and Harrelson occassionally barely stiffling a laught in the interactions, when Rockwell is playing a fool, like in the office with Frances. I dont understand how they let something so visible through the editing process. Or Frances, every time when trying to ""act"" she looks serious and then in the last 2 seconds before cut, she narrows her eyes. ITs like watching a wooden 1 year acting student act. 
Or the so called character study and supposed brilliant portrayal. I understand the pain and regret of the last encounter with the daughter but the woman was a complete B*tch from beginning to the end, the was no progress in her story. And how does killing a person correlate to anything good in the movie or their lifes? Fine, they werent sure but just when they were supposed to be seeing the senselessness of the world and life, their characters take a huge step, not step even, lead back in their development and go back to the beggining. 
Not to mention how she was portrayed as compassionate and starting to understand things and then in the SAME 2 minutes she completely insults and devalues her date in the restaurant but then goes and does something ""nice"" for her husband's date. Who TF wrote this nonsense. Make up your mind.
Lets not even get into the Woody shooting himself with kids in the house when he couldve done much more considerately etc...
Poor acting, poor plot, no character development.... wtf is everyone thinking."

","Don't go by the ratings,the movie is just absurd ."
"amspychalski","5","3","5","5 April 2018"," So much potential wasted - SPOILERS -
","I'm giving this movie 5 stars solely on the performance of the cast and what COULD'VE been an original screenplay. I took issue with many parts of the film and storyline in general, as well as the ending that feels almost incomplete and leaves the viewer with many questions. <br/><br/>I spent the first half of the movie thinking this was based on a true story and that made the entire thing FAR more interesting. It was only when I googled it midway through that I realized it was fiction and was highly let down. Knowing that the writers, director, and producer could've piloted this ship wherever they wanted and ended up with THIS? Well, that's disappointing. <br/><br/>First off - how and why did Peter Dinklage agree to do this film? His character was extremely flat and overly pointless in the end, and we're left wondering why he even existed in this film in the end. Did they write the character to simply provide the alibi to the new police chief? It sure feels that way. And what was the point in the date he and Mildred went on? <br/><br/>Second - is ANYONE facing charges for ANY of their transgressions? How can you assault the local dentist, march into the local police station and verbally assault a police officer, lob Molotov cocktails at the police station until it's a fiery inferno that nearly kills a man, and then get away with all of it with little - if any - questioning? What about Dixon torturing suspects, or nearly killing Red? Nothing? <br/><br/>Isn't our supposed protagonist's character arc centered around her anger and resentment from someone else getting away with crime(s) and seeing very little effort from the police (at least in her eyes)? Isn't this why she, and most of the town for that matter, despise Dixon? Was this intentional irony or just a massive oversight? <br/><br/>Why did 'crop-haired guy' even stop in the gift shop and terrorize Hayes in the first place? How often does this guy from Idaho (a good 8-10 hours away at least) just come hang out in this small MO town, and why? His actions and character make zero sense outside the scope of being an obvious plot device. <br/><br/>I get that the lines between protagonist and antagonist were supposed to be blurred by the end of the movie, it was fairly easy to spot that attempt; but it WASN'T so clear how this even tied into or resolved the overall story. A ""flip-flopping"" character arc only works if the viewer sees how it affects the overall theme or answers any questions in the end; not here though, it's left entirely open ended and the writing is vague enough to leave the viewer wondering. DID they kill the man in Idaho? WOULD they kill the man in Idaho? Are they GOOD people or are they BAD people? <br/><br/> I have no idea either way and the writing is poor enough to leave the viewer with a crapshoot 50/50 guess in the end instead of an ""OH I GET IT!"" kind of feeling. I get the reasoning behind not making it completely obvious, but at the same time people watch movies for their entertainment and artistic value and don't want to leave it feeling like there's another episode next week to wrap it all up - when there isn't. <br/><br/>Luckily I downloaded and watched this movie at home for free; I would neither suggest or advise against anyone doing the same."
"Ed-Shullivan","6","3","5","10 March 2018"," A decent enough cast but with an aborted ending...does that mean an unnecessary sequel?
","Mrs. Shullivan and I were looking forward to seeing this move what with all the hype after receiving six (6) nominations and actually winning two (2) Academy Awards on March 05th, 2018. The cinematography and dramatic performances were both very good. We were however categorically disappointed in the outcome.<br/><br/>Yes, Frances McDormand who plays a divorced mother named Mildred who loses her daughter prematurely as a result of a rape and brutal murder is distraught and frustrated with the local Ebbing Missouri police department who are making zero progress on finding out who was responsible for her daughters rape and murder, and what parent wouldn't be frustrated? However Mildred is not such a quiet introverted nor a passive mother. She is divorced from an abusive husband and willing to go to great lengths to literally push the Ebbings police department and especially the town's Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to put a heck of a lot more effort into investigating her daughters murder and to keep her informed into the police department's progress, or lack there of. <br/><br/>I really thought the film had a strong cast including the likes of John Hawkes, Lucas Hedges, Zeljko Ivanek, Amanda Warren, Abbie Cornish, Peter Dinklage and Clarke Peters whose characters did not match up to the respected actors capabilities. In other words their performances were forgettable as they were peripheral roles in the film and the story line was suspect at best. Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand won an Oscar each for their performances, and Woody Harrelson could have and maybe should have beaten out his co-star Sam Rockwell for best supporting actor, and kudos to them all but I did not think this film was worthy of receiving six (6) Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Most disappointing was the abrupt ending after watching the film for near to two (2) hours which I will not divulge so as not to have to provide a spoiler alert. Maybe the Cohen brothers have plans for a sequel but that would be nothing more than sheer box office greed leaning on their suprising six (6) Academy Award nominations and two (2) winns to which I for one will not be fooled. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.<br/><br/>I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 rating but Academy Award recipient, I think not."

She plays her role well, a feisty women who wants to take matters in to her own hands after her daughter is brutally raped and murdered and no one seems to care.
As a parent you can only feel compassion for her rage and determination.
That is the good side of the movie, the not so good is the fact all of the prejudices they want to shove down my throat.
In no particular order these are the ones that irritated me the most:
The black woman/man getting suppressed by the police;
The police is always well represented with bigots;
Pot should be legal;
It is perfectly fine to burn down a police station if you feel they let you down;
It is absolutely necessary to kick teenagers in the groin when they don't answer your question;
And last but not least, you should always compare a priest or pastor with a gang member.
The only thing missing is the son not being a member of the LBGTQ community, the all the leftists would be satisfied with this movie.<br/><br/>My point being, leave politics out of the movie if they don't contribute to the story.
This movie could have been so much better, but luckily Frances saved the day.<br/><br/>This movie receiving any Oscar at all is preposterous and an insult to all the viewers."

How can a movie like this get such good reviews and receive 2 Oscar awards? With all of the cursing and bad behavior? What is this really teaching anyone? That's it's ok to blow up a police station and not be arrested for it? For a cop to throw a kid out a window and only be fired? I couldn't hardly stand to watch due to all of the cursing, I was about to cut it off but kept trying to ignore that. Why can't movies be written using another word in its place, I mean really. There are millions of words that can be used in place of them, can they not think of anything else? A movie is so much better without all that and even if the movie was boring and no cursing, I would give it a better review than this one. <br/><br/>And why since the movie was filmed in our beautiful mountains of North Carolina that North Carolina can't be in the name? Why Ebbing Missouri when there isn't a town named Ebbing? It wouldn't sound as good? <br/><br/>These Hollywood movies are really going down hill and the reasons why I don't watch as many as I used to.

","I've not rated this film s high as some because I think there's some major flaws in it. The acting from McDormand is fabulous, possibly her best since Fargo. Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell pull out all the stops.
Clarke Peters sadly is like a blast from an 80's TV cop movie but that's not bad, it's just out of place slightly. 
However what really put me off was Abbie Cornish. She's a long way away from being a good actress let alone a great one, and to match her youth with Woody's when he is more than 20 years her senior harks back to bad old days of old men matched with young women. It was unnecessary and if they wanted glamour they could have easily cast someone like Michelle Pfeiffer. 
I didn't know she was in the film so when I saw her and the character she was playing it was very out of place. 
Then we get to a uniquely moving and romantic piece in the film where Woody's character has made love to her for the last time as he has terminal cancer. Reliving that moment Cornish's character as his wife says ""Thanks for that wonderful fuck."" 
WHAT??? One of the most poignant moments in the film and they reduce it to a fuck??? She then goes on to say how beautiful his cock is!
Utterly ruined the moment for me and degraded what is otherwise a fabulous, tremendous movie. What were the editors thinking!?"
"TheMovieDiorama","9","3","5","24 February 2018"," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri shows that a serious subject and dark humour make for a good combination.
","This film really did blow me away, I mean I knew it was going to be good but...not that good! McDonaugh had my undivided attention immediately, and he didn't let me go. Not once. That in itself, is a damn achievement. The mother of a daughter who was raped and murdered rents three billboards as a way of getting the police's attention to find the killer. Sounds like it should be boring right? So you bring in the writer and director of 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' to mix things up abit. What he has managed to conjure up is the perfect equilibrium of depressing real life situations with dark humour in order to create a story about grief. You may not necessarily agree with Mildred's methods yet it evokes sympathy, you empathise with her. Her cold harsh exterior disguises the sadness and sorrow within. When I say harsh, I mean she is savage. Dropping F-Bombs more frequently than a B-2 Stealth, she obliterates anyone in Ebbing who gets in her way...and it is so satisfying to watch. I don't condone large usage of profanity in a script, but when it's put to ingenious use it somehow brings a smile to my face. ""Yeahhh, kick them in the crotch!"". It's a strange trait that actually complements McDormand's portrayal, and wow did she blow my mind. She was devastatingly outstanding to which I'm sure she will win many awards. Her serious demeanour just added to the hilarity of this dark comedy. Rockwell was hilarious as the local idiot officer and also deserves recognition. Harrelson provides some much needed heart and emotion as the chief of police. McDonaugh's best directing effort thus far. The musical score was well suited to the rustic town of Ebbing. I do think the ending could've been cut short by about 5 or 10 minutes, and very occasionally the pacing dips. Very minuscule criticisms for a near perfect film which I'm sure will be even more enjoyable after a repeat viewing. I can smell all the awards from here..."
"lasttimeisaw","8","3","5","24 February 2018"," McDonagh's cracking facility of unorthodox storytelling becomes the linchpin in luring a plethora of admirers
","British filmmaker Martin McDonagh's third feature, TBOEM whisks audience off to an American whistle stop of an unspecified time, possibly in the 90s, since the last client of the titular billboards was from 1986 until our protagonist, a grief-driven Mildred Hayes (McDormand), rents them with texts ""Raped while dying"", ""And Still No Arrests?"", and ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?"" painted in crimson red, as a vehement remonstrance to the slow-in-progress investigation of her murdered 20-year-old daughter Angela (Newton). <br/><br/>The recipient Police Chief Willoughby (Harrelson, the real top-form supporting player here to spew blood and blow heads), on the other hand, is ailed by the impending mortality in the form of cancer, who is not a slouch professionally speaking, on the contrary, he is beloved by the populace, and expresses his resolution to track down the murderer, unfortunately Angela's case is in paucity of both evidence and witness, teetering on the edge of becoming a cold one, and when he is unable to carry on the investigation, the baton is taken up by Jason Dixon (Rockwell), a racist cop who undergoes a major redemptive turnabout thanks to a letter written by Willoughby. <br/><br/>In this bifurcating narrative, one centers on Mildred's militant reactions in the face of the inconsolable bereavement, the ramifications of her contentious advertisement, which bear on the tension between her and her son Robbie (Hedges), ex-husband Charlie (Hawkes, exuding a piercing layer of panache against a formidable McDormand). Scourged by guilt, anguish and grievance, Ms. McDormand reincarnates herself with a tour-de-force seethed with belligerence and compassion, and these two facets' dichotomous incongruence is ambidextrously sublimed into a completely believable persona, a woman who is troublingly reckless, deeply mired in her personal crisis, yet, spurns any throwaway commiserations and homily with razor-sharp astuteness and holds onto the flickering hope of justice in a heartbroken hankering. Oscar No. 2 beckons for this hard-nosed leading lady, a no-bullshitting force of character that quite swims with the topical tide of women's ME TOO movement. <br/><br/>Jason's plot is in no way less salient than Mildred (I will defend that he is a co-leading role up to my deathbed), but this less pathbreaking male-white-trash-goes-good thread feels self-pleasing in the milieu albeit Rockwell nails the character to the hilt with his indissoluble commitment, Jason's transmogrification is thematically satisfactory (although his closeted homosexuality doesn't get a bigger canvas to play betrays the film's conservative-pampering disposition, a wasted opportunity for the up-and-coming Caleb Landry Jones as the unbelievably congenial Red Welby, the manager in the advertise company who is unwarrantedly subjected to Jason's heinous physical abuse, the latter's underlying sexual frustration is left only faintly hinted), it almost renders its contrived sensation (Jason obliviously reading the letter when Mildred tossing Molotov cocktails to the police station where he is) extraneous, because we need someone to track down the killer so badly. <br/><br/>Therefore, in the end of the day, it is Martin McDonagh's cracking facility of unorthodox storytelling that becomes the linchpin in luring a plethora of admirers (this reviewer included), his script flouts conventionalism (yes, pesky kids do need a good kicking!), larded with eccentricity and humor, often when one is least expected (Charlie's 19-year-old new girlfriend Penelope is a hoot, of course, in second-guessing, it is a common tack to find excuse for men in those May-December pairings), and tones down violence but ups his antes in laying bare the complex tie-ins throbbing under the bracket of humanity and morality, warts and all. The truly astonishing but also whip-smart ploy is the open-ended coda, just when we think a climax is in the offing, the film brings down its curtain roundly, what else can top that? As either outcome of Mildred and Jason's vigilante act will look less impactful in the aftermath, a substantial closure may or may not attainable, life can be as misty as the film's opening shots, the cardinal message is that both have found the right path to move on, one has to hand it to Martin McDonagh for its resultant brimming gratification left in its spectator's mind."

","A hard-nosed mother, at the end of her rope, rents a trio of billboards to remind local police that they still have no suspects in her daughter's seven-month-old rape and murder. Very Coen-esque, and not just in that it stars Frances McDormand, who's appeared in half a dozen of their films and is actually married to one of the brothers. Most notable is the way director/screenwriter Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) gets us familiar with dozens of rounded, colorful characters, fleshes them out and makes us care about how their paths intertwine. Or, in most cases, how they collide, break apart and ricochet into the next unsuspecting object. This really gets going in the second act, when a core character makes a profound decision that results in a solid hour of nonstop chain reactions. But it's not all dark gristle and angry monologues. Often, it works as an effective black comedy, which I realize is a tough thing to recognize after admitting it's about a rape investigation. Such tension-breakers are crucial, though, to keep us from getting too bogged down in the solemnity of it all, and to maintain a sense of momentum. Wonderfully shot, with plenty of time dedicated to exploring the beat-up small town at the center of all the drama, it's also expertly paced, brilliantly acted and continuously surprising. A deserved favorite for the Oscars."

","Disappointing. Winner of Golden Globe, SAG and nominated for an Oscar? If this is the best HW can do, this year may set a record for dearth of quality in the film industry. 
If you've read the critics, you know that there are some positives, with sporadic moments involving entertaining lines and watchable acting. But they are the exception in this meandering, exploitative, manipulative mish mash. Some characters are such overblown stereotypes that, at times, the film resembles a bad night on SNL. I can't count the number of improbable, villainous strawmen the the writer self righteously and repeatedly mows down. He must have been going for the world record in virtue posing, to say nothing of the tired, old, excessive use of juvenile profanity that's been embarrassing the big screen since the 70's. <br/><br/>There are so many vices, that to recite them all would require more time than this movie is worth. Although the inexplicable fawning over this effort continues with several Oscar nominations, including screenplay and editing, at least the Academy had the sense to omit McDonagh from the direction category. At least they got something right."

","This film came with high expectations, fresh from its Golden Globe win for best picture. But while evocatively shot on location in Sylvia North Carolina and featuring a stellar performance from Frances McDormand as Mildred, I just couldn't get into the vibe of the story. There seems to be a fundamental disconnect between the steely determination of grieving mother Mildred Hayes, seeking police action to find and charge her daughter's murderer some months after the event, and supporting roles which came across as heavy handed caricatures or slap stick stupidity. <br/><br/>The story is complex with interplay of relationships and shifting sands of alliances and love interests, which at times just seemed contrived. It can be difficult to define where 'unpredictable' strays into 'confused', but for me, it was more confusing than intriguingly unpredictable. It was promoted as a perfect balance of comedy and drama, but I didn't find the comedy particularly funny; more seriously, it detracted from the impact of the dramatic aspects of the story. <br/><br/>Maybe I got stuck on the police being so unprofessional and little happening to rectify the situation. If this is really small town middle America in 2017, I'm ever so grateful I don't live there."

","Rape, murder, cancer (and arson) - this movie pulls no punches. The billboards encourage a violent response and, as we know, violence begets violence. All the performances are gut-wrenchingly good, especially McDormand who wears her grief like an ever-present shroud. If I have one negative reaction it's my usual one to the relentless use of f-words (and even the c-word, although this is amusingly exchanged in one kitchen table scene between Mildred and her rebellious teenage son). The frequent shifts of tone from tragedy to comedy are brilliantly scripted.<br/><br/>A tough film to watch, but a good one - even a great one. I'll be surprised if McDormand doesn't beat Meryl Streep to the podium at this year's Academy Awards. Mildred is one of those characters who will stay with you long after you leave the cinema."
"senan-gilsenan","9","3","5","18 January 2018"," Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.
","The writer & director, Martin McDonagh, has managed to capture the subtle dark sense of humour which often seems to accompany death and grieving. He recognises how it is used as a coping mechanism to deal with the loss of a loved one; yet the line between drawing offense or being funny is thin. 
McDonagh mastered this in his first film, In Bruge, which was marketed as comedy, even though it dealt with murder and suicide. A lot of the audience see 3 billboards as a comedy too, but it is not. Truthfully, it is another film which deals with grieving and loss, all five stages of it, with all the myriad expressions of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.
The small town setting in Missouri works really well. It could almost be a small town in Ireland , or anywhere for that matter. Small towns are small pools in which the big fish are always the more louder and brashist characters. Enter Sam Rockwell, who plays the role of a racist policeman who redeems himself in the end. He is the equal to Colin Farrell's characters in 7 Psychopaths (another McDonagh film which they both starred in) and In Bruge. 
Frances McDormand is commanding in nearly every scene playing a local anti-hero who everyone is polite to on account of the recent loss of her daughter, yet behind her back they all judge. 
Woody Harrelson is just getting better and better at playing yet another role in which he almost sucks in both respect and empathy. 
This is such a fine film that I watched it again, the very next day. It is a non-Hollwood production which despite winning Best Picture at the Golden Globes, it seems to be getting it fair share of 'haters' in America. I would guess that this is because of the dissmissive way in which the narratve deals with racism in the Southern States. It seems to say that at the end of the day, people are just people and that a person's colour is irrelevant."

","Produced by Film4.<br/><br/>This Oscar contender could fall into several categories. A murder mystery, or revenge in search of justice, or black comedy. This is about a truly angry mother, Mildred (Frances McDormand) who is grieving the rape and murder of her teenage daughter.<br/><br/>She is frustrated with the lack of progress in the case, so after 7 months decides to put up three large billboard signs leading into town with bold messages to prompt the local police force, particularly chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) into action.

The town's folk have sympathy for Mildred but also respect the police chief, we also learn that the chief is dying of cancer, hence the added controversy behind the billboards. <br/><br/>The story that follows is fascinating and unpredictable. Essentially, all people are bad, everything is dreadful, nothing will ever improve and how anger can consume a person!<br/><br/>Highly recommended film combining dark comedy with a serious subject matter."
"Popcorn_Media","9","3","5","14 January 2018"," A dark comedy against an absorbing drama.
","If I can compliment a film with at least 5 adjectives, more than likely it's etched in my membrane, there to be championed to as many folks as possible who are willing to listen.<br/><br/>Any film worth remembering provokes a mixture of emotions out of you; laughs, cries, interest, shock, awe. And any film that has a strong or unique story with equally unique characters, should resonate with you in a way that's either self-reflective or empathetic or ideally both.<br/><br/>Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's latest offering is such a film. Ever since the red band trailer dropped some months ago, I was already psyched. Three Billboards managed the impressive feat of having a range of responses from me, from nervous laughter to unexpectedly crying to consistent intrigue. I was mesmerised by the bold, profane and at times delicate script as we're given a host of characters that are either unruly or difficult but remained sympathetic and captivating all the same.<br/><br/>We see Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) driving down Drinkwater road one afternoon and she spots three unused billboards that hasn't been used in many years (a fine little detail we see is one of the billboards says 'worth stopping for'). She sits fidgeting for a bit, contemplating on what they could be used for. She heads down to the Ebbing advertising company ran by Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) to negotiate the terms on how to advertise and how much it is to advertise the billboards. She intends to use them for at least a year and for what she intends the billboards to say, Red is quickly sympathetic to her cause by saying ""you must be Angela Hayes' mother"".<br/><br/>Angela Hayes is the recently slain daughter of Mildred. Some 7 months prior she was kidnapped, raped and burnt beyond recognition with no new developments on the case. Unsatisfied with this motion, the billboards say the following; RAPED WHILE DYING, STILL NO ARRESTS, HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?. From then on in She wages a one-woman war against the local police department by calling them for them seeming incompetence of their service. This doesn't sit well with the rest of the community as Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) is much revered by everyone.<br/><br/>Something noticeable throughout Mcdonagh's work is with all the cynicism and venom characters spew at one another, we have the vulnerability and depravity revealed in sometimes small doses but they never feel forced. It's not a mechanic used to force us to care about people, it's welcome in that they deal with their tragedy or luck with humour that's brash and twisted that enables them to push through their dilemma.<br/><br/>The townsfolk of Ebbing had me caring for just about everyone, including the ones opposing against Mildred. There's no clear-cut villain here (other than the scumbag or scumbags who tortured and murdered Angela). We're shown how vengeance, rage and glee can evolve into something rather dis-compassionate. How sometimes dialling back and seeing the future of your rightful cause for inflicting your sense of justice can further down the line turn into you something dangerous and inaccessible for infamous reasons.<br/><br/>Veteran talent like Harrelson, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Lucas Hedges and Abbie Cornish all shine here but Sam Rockwell's turn as the dimwitted, inconsiderate but disarmingly endearing Dixon is a plum role that deserves Best Supporting Actor recognition.
The showcase here is by far McDormand's volcanic, bad ass Mildred. She exhibits such humanity, drive and sardonic wit that her means of venting out and search for closure invites a whirlwind of frustration and anxiety amongst everyone around her. She's working on peak power, one that undoubtedly will score her an Oscar nomination. It's extraordinary work.<br/><br/>Mildred is the strongest, most empowering character I've seen in a long time. Her arc serves to address how we all just need to step back and contemplate on why we feed the fire with fire. Even the smaller characters are well rounded enough in how they propose alternatives and insight to the more flawed characters. Mcdonagh never misses an opportunity to show us fire or red or some kind of tension. We're asked to recognise the potential of our anger and offset it with something more serene and responsible, a morality tale that asks us to be constructive, not destructive.<br/><br/>This film is grim, twisted, devastating, unpredictable, inspiring, bold and of course funny. I'm sore I didn't see this in 2017 as it would've toppled Dunkirk as my fave of that year. Alas, it's 2018 and even though it's the first film I've seen this year, I'm positive nothing this year will dethrone Three Billboards as my fave of the year.<br/><br/>Striking, wicked and brilliantly acted, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has raw power that's balanced with clever wit which makes for a rewarding and unpredictable experience.<br/><br/>"
"littlemankazoo","9","3","5","13 January 2018"," A thoughtful meditation on Anger, Hate, Love, Revenge and Humanity
","Rarely does a film come along that truly encompasses a time better than this film, while all the while remaining timeless and able to send a message that speaks to any time or any people. I believe 'Three Billboards' is one of those films.<br/><br/>A theme that reverberates throughout this film is 'Anger', and equally what it can do to us as humans. It can cause us to take drastic measures. Cause us to do unreasonable things. Cause us to not listen and let our emotions overcome us. Throughout this film, depicted through masterful performances by McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell, we receive a story that manages to be dark, unsettling and even somewhat funny about what happens when we let anger take over our emotions and throw caution to the wind for any human that stands in our way.<br/><br/>In a time where anger and vitriol are perhaps at their most prevalent, this film sends a simple statement in its closing moments: ""Anger begets greater anger"". The film itself illustrates just how far humanity and our emotions can push us, from the 'three billboards' in question into a domino effect that can ruin lives, destroy human beings, and only spawn worse and worse hatred for our fellow man.<br/><br/>In the end, we find that only understanding and forgiveness can help us succeed as humans, and perhaps some of that humanity that causes us to do insane things can be good for finding understanding and chance for change. THAT, my friends, is what this film is about, and it tells an amazing story to get us there.<br/><br/>The performances are certainly as good as you have heard. McDormand's performance is neither a hero nor a villain, but a human one and a vulnerable one. Harrelson is just as human, with plenty of heart and realism to go along with him. Rockwell is perhaps one of the most incredible development cycles of any character I have ever seen, but I will not DARE spoil it for anyone. His performance is worth the price of admission alone...<br/><br/>This film is about humans. About emotion. About the dangerous concoction those two things can create and what they can ironically destroy through that...but at the same time, it is also about how powerful we can be when we allow that red-hot anger to simmer, and allow ourselves to be as good of humans as we can be.<br/><br/>This film is about humanity, and there's no better time than now to be reminded of how good than bad we can...<br/><br/>9/10"

","Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell is all I needed to know about this movie before seeing it. The trio only add to an already solid script and bring it to life as the three main characters.<br/><br/>McDormand plays Mildred, an angry, bad-ass mother who won't take shit from anybody, especially when it comes to finding her daughter's killer. Pissed off that after seven months no arrests have been made in the case she decides to take matters into her own hands - in a most unexpected way. Just down the street from her home sits three billboards long since abandoned on the side of a road rarely used after the installation of a new highway nearby. Now, however, construction has re-routed traffic back to this stretch of road, and Mildred scrapes together the billboards' rental fee to post a little message to Ebbing's Chief of Police (welcome back Woody Harrelson). The message: get off your ass and do something (I'm paraphrasing).<br/><br/>Chief Willoughby has his own problems, and tries the sympathy card to reason with Mildred. He wants the billboards gone for the better of the town he claims, even though the law says Mildred is doing nothing wrong. She doesn't want to hear it, and pushes him further into action.<br/><br/>Enter seemingly corrupt mamma's boy cop, Officer Dixon (played brilliantly by Sam Rockwell) who knows a thing or two about how you solve problems in Ebbing. He too, it seems, will stop at nothing to get what he wants. What he wants is to protect his good friend (and the only reason why he still has a job), the Chief.<br/><br/>This easy-to-follow, sometimes darkly-funny movie keeps you interested right from the beginning. This isn't your typical ""I know who did it"" crime-drama. This could easily be a true story, but it's not. However, the concept of using billboards to push for justice is true and happened more than two decades ago in the deep southern United States, according to director Martin McDonagh. ""What kind of pain would lead somebody to do that?"" he asked himself at the time.<br/><br/>Now we know, and I would have done the same."

","What a fabulous movie. The cast performances are all outstanding but the undeniable star of this film is Martin McDonagh's script and direction.<br/><br/>There isn't a second wasted; every moment is used to full effect and at some points you can be almost overwhelmed as two or even three plot twists avalanche on top of each other. But it's skill is also in the skill of integrating contrasting quiet segments which let the film breathe but at the same time are packed full of clever plot moves and powerful emotions.<br/><br/>I havn't enjoyed a 'middle America' film so much since No Country for Old Men and I hope this film is both suitably recognised at the Oscars but also endures in history as a spectacularly accomplished piece of film making."
"vsks","9","3","5","11 January 2018"," You think it's about chutzpah, but it's about heartbreak
","On a drive through the American South some years ago, British writer-director Martin McDonagh saw a set of billboards that challenged the authorities similar to the way the sheriff of Ebbing, Missouri, is challenged in this film. The rage they embodied stayed with him, and although this film is billed as a black comedy, don't go looking for belly laughs. Its true subject is heartbreak. 
With an intelligent script that's perhaps a few minutes too long, McDonagh's characters' actions impinge on others like billiard balls knocking about on the table. Mildred Hayes (played by Frances McDormand-a genius at portraying tough, uncompromising women) intends for her actions to affect others when she pays for three billboards to be pasted up on a remote stretch of road outside town, blood red and anger-filled: ""Raped While Dying. And Still No Arrests? How Come, Sheriff Willoughby?"" Guilt and anger are written just as clearly on her unsmiling face.
The sheriff's deputies, accustomed to have their way in all local matters, great and small, are offended. They want her to take them down. Of course she won't. One of them, Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is an overgrown boy, prey to his every violent whim and McDonagh gives him a complex character arc.
Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) has other troubles on his mind and, while it's true he hasn't made progress in solving Angela Hayes's murder, it isn't true that he hasn't tried. Although his place in their world is the slipperiest, he has the best sense of what that place is.
Several supporting roles are equally powerful (I especially liked Mildred's ex-husband's new girlfriend), and there are some laughs-people being their natural selves can be hilarious, usually without meaning to be. Though a broken heart manifests itself differently in all three main characters, it's Sheriff Willoughby who points the way to healing. Already the film has received numerous awards and nominations, including the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama, with Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Martin McDonagh (screenplay) winners too."
"grantss","6","3","5","1 January 2018"," Not bad but lacks focus
","In an effort to track down who raped and murdered her daughter, Mildred Hayes has three billboards erected outside her town of Ebbing, Missouri. They accuse the Sheriff of doing nothing to catch the killer. This causes a largely adverse reaction amongst the town's folk , not least one of the sheriff's deputies, the hot-headed, irascible Jason Dixon.<br/><br/>Heaps of potential, much of which is wasted. The movie is intriguing and entertaining from the outset - the murder mystery, the town dynamic, the interesting array of characters, all presented with dark tongue-in-cheek humour. Just from the trailer this reminded me of a Coen Brothers movie (not just because it stars Frances McDormand and feels Fargo-esque, or because McDormand is married to Joel Coen) and the initial part of the movies goes some way to reinforce this. <br/><br/>However, writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) never quite matches the effortless slickness, tightness, engagement, focus and story-telling ability of the Coens. Most tellingly, the plot seems to stumble along, with no clear direction. Yes, there is the murder mystery, which is intriguing to the very end, but the sub-plots around it seem disjointed. Moreover, there is little in the way of clear themes. Even at the end, the messaging is confused and seems to be more a case of McDonagh having a bet each way, rather than making a solid point.<br/><br/>A little bit of focus would have gone a long way.<br/><br/>Can't fault the cast though. Frances McDormand is excellent as Mildred Hayes, as is Sam Rockwell as Dixon and Woody Harrelson as Sheriff Willoughby. Good supporting cast which includes some biggish names - Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish and Kerry Condon."

This is a comical drama-or, dramatic comedy-that has good actors and a good story but a bad ending that leaves you hanging. Frances plays a woman that had a daughter that was found raped and murdered and then set on fire. She doesn't think the police chief, Woody, has done his job in finding the killer responsible. Frances decides to put a message on three billboards stating her feelings. Nothing slanderous or untrue. She just poses the question of why Woody has not caught the killer, yet. Abbie plays Woody's wife and Sam is a racist deputy that lives at home with his mother. Almost all of the characters are complex, and will throw you a curve-no one is all good or all bad. Even Frances does things that are questionable and lies about things. If the ending were better, I would have given it a higher rating.

To them, dead space equals depth.<br/><br/>I gave it a 6 because the acting is terrific and the unexpected twists are more than welcome. I deducted points for certain twists that just didn't add up: burning down a police station and nearly killing a man earns a shrug after hearing a highly unlikely alibi? Don't think so.<br/><br/>And the ending! Take the two least likely people to buddy up and go on a revenge craze on someone who had nothing to do with the daughter's murder. Cute, huh?

When I heard about this film and read the premise I felt like this could be something that would make award season waves. The film has got a stellar cast to both and does a wonderful mix of comedy and drama to drive home a piece of film that is one of the strongest of the year thus far.<br/><br/>The film follows a lady who rents out three billboards outside of Ebbing, Missouri, which point fingers at the local officer Chief Willoughby, for not solving the death and rape of her teenage daughter. These ads become controversial as the chief is a beloved figure of the community and people start having mixed but strong reactions to the billboards. There is a scramble to figure out the results of the case, and the main characters all have life changing consequences of being involved.<br/><br/>This has to be the strongest Frances McDormand performance I have ever seen. She's always great but this was a total embodiment of a determined and strong willed mother who perseveres, despite knowing most of the town can't stand her guts. Woody Harrelson is typically good and we once again get a great Sam Rockwell showing once again showing how underrated he is. You become engulfed into the film and wrapped into everything that occurs.<br/><br/>The film has its funny moments but it also is heavy handed and deals with a devastating loss. The film remains somewhat unpredictable and while the end is a bit open ended and brings more questions than answers, it doesn't detract from a strong written work that was satisfying to see at the tail end of the year.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

Don't get me wrong, I love dark humor; but the director needed to decide if the movie was going to be a slapstick comedy or a drama, not both.

","While not really billed as a comedy this movie had me laughing on so many occasions it was hard to realise that it is about such a sad situation.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are outstanding and Frances really did deserve the Best Actress Oscar. <br/><br/>Being a big fan of all three top billed actors made this a very easy choice for a movie to watch and repeated viewings are almost essential.<br/><br/>While the story and some situations are heart rending, very sad and in some cases brutal, the subtle comedy still shines though. <br/><br/>This would have to be, for me the best movie of 2017 and I will be watching it again and again."

Frances McD was also great as her pure realistic role of a mother on the verge of snapping but keeping her cool despite knowing that she'll be in mental agony for the rest of her life. Now, WHY could they not just give us 10 more minutes and show the ending that everyone wanted.

"Iusedtobeacat","9","4","8","7 March 2018"," An Outstanding movie that deals with human psychology.
","Ok, maybe I'm a bit biased here but I really enjoyed this movie. It's very rare that I give a movie a 9/10 rating but this movie was exceptional! It's very rare that I come across a story that pulls at my heartstrings the way this movie's story did. <br/><br/>The characters were very sympathetic; once that you can actually relate to. People were complaining about how some of the characters were committing felonies, or seemed decent but advocated racism and it seemed too surreal and cartoonish. Well, that was one of the things I absolutely liked about this movie there was no absolute good or bad, most of the characters seemed more genuine because they were flawed. Yes, they did horrible acts from time to time but had redeeming qualities if that isn't realistic then I don't think a Hero/Villein character would have been. I enjoyed this layout so much more than the usual cookie-cutter character set up that most films seem to have. It made the movie more refreshing to watch in that you didn't fully root for one person over the other it might have made the situation appear too messy but so is real life. The grieving mother who is seeking justice for her murdered daughter isn't always a good mother, the county sheriff might be bad at his job but he really cares about the well being of those around him, the racist jerk might turn out to be quite alright one day and stop acting like a stuck up jerk. Things like that happen in real life more often than not, justice doesn't always get served and many cases go cold without having a happy ending. Cynical? Maybe but you can't argue that it's unrealistic.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for anyone who's looking for something raw and a good story to watch. I hope you like it as much as I did."
"beccabentley","9","4","8","3 March 2018"," Surprisingly good!
","This film was a cinema treat for my mum as she fancied seeing it on her birthday. I had no clue going in what it was about. And if I had to describe it afterwards to someone, I'm sure it wouldn't sound like a particularly amazing film. The story wasn't terribly exciting but the characters made the story so moving and gripping. The acting by everyone in it was superb. Not a big fan of all the bad language but it did make the film feel more grittily real. I usually prefer more fantastical films which give some escapism but I surprised myself and the film itself surprised me. Sam Rockwell (whom I have liked since The Green Mile) was such a dislikeable character but the way he developed through the film was really well done. The film plays well on your emotions and somehow manages to bring little bits of humour out of a tragic situation and some appalling decisions. I still smile thinking about my favourite bit when Sam Rockwell's character shies away a little bit from his lighter (because of what has happened to him - I won't spoil it by saying what). It doesn't sound funny here but he makes even a small thing like this funny. The film makes you think about how inherently decent people can make bad or good choices and what the unexpected consequences can be. I wasn't too sure about the ending but I suppose it left the viewer to decide for themselves what happened next. I would say this film definitely deserves some oscars."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - It's a bleak movie, and I do mean bleak! But it's so well made that it never becomes overbearing or depressing to sit through. In fact it's interesting, moving and entertaining throughout. The script must have been really tight, the writing is some of the best I have seen in recent years and acting is superb. Everyone brings their best(or close to) in this, but Frances McDormand steals the show with an amazing performance. If she doesn't win best female actor then something is really wrong..

"lesleyharris30","9","4","8","2 March 2018"," An Immensely Suspenseful, Brilliantly Performed Journey,
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. While it is slowly paced and dialogue heavy, the film never manages to get boring, I cared and was intrigued by these characters from beginning to end, wanting to see them develop. I expected it to be a lot more thrilling, it certainly moves a lot slower than Martin McDonagh's previous films, but it did not bother me one bit, the pace actually adds to the suspense and the mundanity of these people's lives. <br/><br/>I did feel Peter Dinklage was a little wasted, I loved every scene he had and thought his characterisation was terrific, but he simply was not used enough. His character had so much more potential than what he is given. <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely flawless, every single role, big and small, fits in to this world magnificently. Frances McDormand is completely immersed and utterly believable from beginning to end as a conflicted mother looking to avenge her daughter, and Woody Harrelson is the heart and soul of the film, delivering a character who begins simple, but winds up having a powerful arc. The highlight of the film, for me, was without any doubt Sam Rockwell as Dixon. Normally playing very likeable characters, he starts off completely unredeemable and soon later, McDonagh and Rockwell manage to make us sympathise with this character despite giving us no real reason to, great scriptwriting and acting simply comes together beautifully here. <br/><br/>Impactful and original. Some of the best acting and writing I have seen in a while, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri does not disappoint and I would recommend it to all moviegoers.<br/><br/>

","..and one of the best movies of the 2010's, if not quite easily the best movie of 2017/18. Three Billboards shows how anger, tragedy and emotions, lead to more tragedy if you react aggressively to everything happening to you. 
Three Billboards is a psychological study, a moving experiment, that is so realistic and unconventional, that when you see it, you think finally I'm seeing something really great. The acting performances are phenomenal, everybody works to his strengths. The movie discovers the principals of society, the relationships, that aren't one sided.

"PetarNeo","10","4","8","26 February 2018"," It will make you explore deepest thoughts
","There are always new ways of exploring crime stories and Three billboards goes in such directions that you could probably never imagine. Story of Three billboards explores human nature as it finds itself trapped in mystery and missing answers, which will show us how far individuals are capable of going to get peace and satisfaction over pain and grief. If you stop asking yourself and keep pushing toward better and healthier state of mind without any satisfaction you will face how you go mad and so Martin McDonagh creates story in such fashion that main character is strongest person and is capable of provoking and harming everybody that doesn't want to help her (Mildred). Mildred (Frances McDormand) is the mother that seeks answers and keeps pushing everybody around her as far it is possible and with doing so (Frances) gives a powerful performance of strong women that will melt and destroy them all if they try to defy her. Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and Dixon (Sam Rockwell) are two officers that are being influenced most by actions of Mildred and it was pretty horrifying to see how they will cope with such pressure. Sam Rockwell is giving us one of the most honest performances as he turns completely from inside out. Martin McDonagh is an absolute master in creating difficult situations that can also be explored in his previous movies such as 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths' and continues to write and whole story that will suck you in as easy as you drink your drink at movie theatre while looking Three Billboards and wonder how actually good is he as movie maker. If you love crime drama genre you will absolutely fall in love with this one and it is easily one of the best movie this year because it will make you think about everything that has happened and try to evaluate how is it to deal with all of it which also gives a huge philosophical characteristics. 4/4"

Three Billboards had such an emotional story that was surrounded by a dark sequence that was funny at times, and extremely distressing at others. 
I now finally understand why Frances McDormand is winning all these awards because she was truly staggering playing Mildred. 
I think Sam Rockwell was very good as well, not good enough to win a Golden Globe or an Oscar( My preference).

"asifahsankhan","9","4","8","20 February 2018"," One of my favorites from last year!
","Martin McDonagh is one of my favorite directors and from his first two films, I was certain I knew his brand: wildly witty, self-aware nihilism; the irreverence of Tarantino and panache of Guy Ritchie blended with quaaludes to a sweet, sludgy black. In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths were both favorites of mine, but their message - if one could charitably call it that - was ""Let's watch the world burn through a fogged-up funhouse mirror.""<br/><br/>Three Billboards is a different, more mature animal. It has all the cleverness, and gleeful blasphemy, of his earlier films - unquotable monologues, manic fits of disproportionate violence. But it also has something serious to say, and is willing to take its brooding time saying it. In that sense, it's hard not to compare it to his brother's film Calvary. If Calvary asked the question ""What use is faith in a world whose institutions fail to earn it?"", Three Billboards asks ""What good is anger when there's no one to absorb the blame?"" It's a story of characters filled with righteous indignation and no proper place to funnel it. Mildred Hayes can't believe her daughter's murder hasn't been solved. Sgt Dixon can't believe his boss's good name is being dragged through the mud. In typical playwright fashion, improbably heightened events are used to tease out real emotions from real people: the point isn't what happens, it's how these characters would respond if it had. Perfectly scripted and wonderfully realized (Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are particularly great), those responses are always earned. If you go in expecting an A-to-B storyline with lovable heroes, you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you're ready to soak in a few hours of gray, you'd be hard pressed to do better than this. One of my favorites from last year."

"michael_balsdon","9","4","8","12 February 2018"," Three Billboards. A funny, depressing ride.
","Three Billboards manages to be funny while it concentrates on its dark and serious subject matter. The cast turn in amazing performances with Sam Rockwell's Dixon being one of the standouts as his character arc is one of the most interesting in the film. The film reflects the harsh reality of the world we live and while the film does paint the police force in Ebbing Missouri as incompetent, it also shows the hard task that they face when trying to catch killers and rapists. The films premise and story aspects feel relatable as the tragedy that befell Frances McDormand's characters daughter, has most likely happened to someone else and the characters act in way that feels real and their reaction to certain events in the film are justified. Overall, the movie is fantastic and is definitely worth every one of its Oscar nomination's, boasting a powerful story , great performances and genuinely funny and sad moments."
"remakesramistake","10","4","8","9 February 2018"," Hate is the answer... or not?
","Martin MacDounagh has written one of the best screenplays of the decade. ""Three billboards out of Ebbing"" manages to delve into human psychology better than almost every film that I have seen up to date. The events are being portrayed both with tragic and comical scenes giving a grey aspect in the film's aesthetic. Same goes with the characters. No one in this movie is either bad or good person. They are just persons. With both their good and their bad side. The film doesn't choose sides. Frances McDormand is excellent as the mourning mother of her horrible killed daughter. Woody Harrelson is amazing as the dying from cancer police chief of Ebbing who tries his best to do his duty in a world that doesn't appreciate it. But the revelation of this film is Sam Rockwell. This actor delivers his best performance until now and maybe for his whole career. All the actors (leading or secondary) are acting their roles perfectly delivering us the message of this masterpiece of a film; no person is only good or only bad. The film doesn't justify any person's actions and doesn't choose to support anyone. It just presents us the events as they are; a mingle of tragedy and comedy just like life. People can easily do bad as easily as they can do good. And they can be really good if they try. Martin McDonaugh's film is a masterpiece which in a couple of decades it will be considered a classic and one of the most representative films of American independent cinema."
"wgingery","9","4","8","7 February 2018"," Three Things People Don't Get - EXPLAINED
","What do you do, after your daughter is raped and murdered? Or after your father/hero dies? Or after you learn you will very soon die of an incurable disease, leaving a wife and children?<br/><br/>You get angry. Angry at everything and everybody; angry at life. That is the motor at the heart of this brilliantly written film. It propels the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, down and up, down and further down and up again.<br/><br/> Putting them on a collision course with the lovingly-sketched community, that anger makes them do fearful things, like put of billboards, drill a dentist's thumb, get drunk, and beat up a black man, If you let it, anger will even turn you into a one-person wrecking crew; you throw a man out of second-floor window, or lob molotov cocktails at the police station. On the other hand, if, like Willoughby, you understand it, you can leave beautiful memories. It's your call.<br/><br/>But how do you get from A to B? Well, first, you have to figure out where A is.
What really sets this film apart is how it conveys what's BEHIND the anger. So the first thing to get is that the music is the key to understanding the film. In fact, it's almost like an opera. Right from the opening <br/><br/>""'Tis the Last Rose of Summer,
 Left blooming alone. . . .<br/><br/>When true hearts lie withered,
 And fond ones have flown,
Oh, who would inhabit
 This bleak world alone?""<br/><br/>These words depicting the passing of love, beauty, and, ultimately, life itself, transport the viewer at once to the profound melancholy at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Each of the three main characters, Mildred, Dixon, and Willoughby struggles, stricken by a sense of the evanescence of life and the finality of death.
 
Frances McDormand is splendid at conveying the kaleidoscope of emotions, from steely resolve to despair to volcanic wrath. Equally fine are Sam Rockwell as Dixon and Woody Harrelson as Willoughby.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, though, that this is NOT REALISM! Don't expect it to ""make sense."" After all, the heart doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>""Anger begets only anger."" They both see - Mildred when she sees that her anger has almost cost a man his life - that they can't go on as before, but each still must find the way to set anger aside:<br/><br/>""Alone"" is a key word. That is why the emotional climax comes when Mildred and Dixon make the decision to work TOGETHER.<br/><br/>So the third thing to understand is that this is NOT A POLICE PROCEDURAL It's not about finding the guilty man. Instead, it is about the heart, how it is wounded, and how it is healed. <br/><br/>Some viewers have complained that the scene is too slow. But I think that it needs time to show both how very, very difficult it is for each of them, and that they understand that there is no going back. <br/><br/>By the closing scene, they haven't forgotten their losses, but, as the tender version of ""Buckskin Stallion Blues"" suggests, they have put it behind them and they are ready, however tentatively, to reenter life."

"kaischammakhi","10","4","8","30 January 2018"," Very Satisfied (9.5/10)
","I went to the movies expecting to see a good film from the director of ""In Bruges"" and ""7 Psychopaths"" , but it surprised me and went far beyond my expectations.
I mean clearly Three Billboards is 2017's surprise. It's got some of the year's best performances, from Sam Rockwell's foolish, racist, corrupt and resentful Officer Dixon to Woody Harrelson, who's proving that 2017 was his year after good performances in both ""War for the planet of the apes"" and ""The edge of seventeen"" then ends the year with this sensational performance of a beloved parent and respected chief of police confronted by an angry, grieving mother played by the incredible Frances McDormand, seriously words can't describe this woman and her performace. Besides, the supporting cast, including Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes and Peter Dincklage, was stunning although it had little sceen time.
And what can I say about writer and director Martin McDonagh's work other than complete. The screenwriting was flawless and the events were unpredictable in a way you would jump of your seat. And eventhough the film was about grief, anger and vengeance, the script has got plenty of funny moments which were all effective.
I can only think of a single flaw in the whole movie which was an unsuccessful use of CGI, otherwise, I think it would've been perfect."

"paulmcuomo","10","4","8","23 January 2018"," A film that may not have all the answers, but doesn't claim to. Oh, and top notch acting and writing of course!
","I saw this film yesterday, and I do not regret it - 100% will watch it again.<br/><br/>The movie is very much unlike many other movies out at the minute, or in really recent history. Even by Martin McDonaugh's standard's, this is a movie that doesn't fit into the same Black Comedy box as his previous two movies ""In Bruges"" or ""Seven Psychopaths"". In fact, this movie is far more up on tragedy than those two, which even in their sad moments have some humour. Don't get me wrong; this is not a film that's lacking in colour or dynamics, but it's certainly bleaker than those others by McDonaugh.<br/><br/>At the head of this movie is a phenomenal cast. The most notable of these are the recent Oscar nominated Frances McDormand as Mildred Hayes, Woody Harrelson as Sheriff Bill Willoughby and Sam Rockwell as Officer Jason Dixon.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is a force of nature in this role, and is certainly her best film work since/included Fargo, depending on your opinion. Her character of Mildred is one that could very easily be portrayed as a flawless martyr, striving for justice for her daughter at the behest of everyone else but whom will convince the audience to see her as a perfect person and nothing more. But she doesn't, as whilst you will laugh and cheer when she confronts Dixon in the station with her now famous ""Hey f***head!"", you have issues when she tells Willoughby she doesn't care of his cancer, but is later sympathetic when she starts to wain. It's a character that could easily have been boring, but isn't in her hands. The best example of this is when they show a flashback to her final chat with her daughter, and her daughter yells ""I hope I get raped on the way"", she responds ""I hope you get raped too!"", and that's what happened. It's a great moment, played as intensely as needed for it to work.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson plays a side of him people rarely see. He's not in the film for very long, as he kills himself fairly early in, but he certainly stays in the mind despite this. Willoughby is a man trying to do the right thing, but is going against an unbeatable obstacle, and who we, as an audience, do get a sense of despite his short screen time: a funny, compassionate, well respected leader of the police, and a great father and husband at the same time. When he went, I legit teared up.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell, in his best work ever, plays the character who goes through the biggest arc in the movie. At the start, Dixon is very much a bitter, violent cop with a fragile ego, who when it breaks becomes scary. His endpoint however, whilst not a complete 180, is still big; he learns to take his time, think things through, and be more willing to do a policeman's work for the good of the community than himself.<br/><br/>Martin McDonaugh's screenplay is top tier brilliance, as humour and horror do exist in the same plain, and his direction is just as sterily clean, so when the violence does hit, it really does. The two biggest examples are when the fight between Mildred, her ex-husband Charlie played by John Hawkes, and her son Robbie played by Lucas Hedges, and when Dixon attacks the billboard owner in a rage at his office.<br/><br/>The ending, whilst not what I was expecting, was welcome. To me, it signals that whilst the resolve isn't there, the character's of Mildred and Jason have found a purpose beyond and this helps them to cope. As they head off to places unknown to do a thing they're not sure of, we know that their moral compasses are still guiding them, in this very adult, very great film, that is totally worth a rewatch.<br/><br/>One last thing: the race issue in this movie, is something that, if it hadn't been brought up, you wouldn't notice. It's ironic that in a movie that is based around growing in compassion and empathy, that this strange label of racism has been put on a movie that neither promotes these viewpoints, but the character's that do exhibit these points of view see the error of them.<br/><br/>Whatever; I enjoyed this film regardless, and that won't change. If you think it looks like a good viewing, give it a go."

","We saw a lot of great movies in 2017 and I can confidently say that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of them. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh the movie is a winner in every category . It's original, it has great performances and a plot full of brutal, funny and sad moments. It's balance of humor, violence and drama is remarkable and not easy at all to find in today's movies. The real asset of this movie though is Frances McDormand. She plays a non likable and very complex character and delivers one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. She manages to make you like and fully understand a violent character, basically the 'villain' of the movie something that I have experienced very few times and that's one of the reasons I gave the movie 10 stars. The truth is ,not everyone can appreciate and understand the bizarre style of the movie and I am very disappointed to see that this movie is hated by a lot of people. Love it or hate it there is no denying that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a unique movie and definitely something that you don't see everyday. I believe though that even more people are going to love it and that's the reason I decided to write this review. To maybe push people to watch it and see with their own eyes McDonagh's great achievement."
"n-kefala","9","4","8","21 January 2018"," Wonderful dark comedy
","A story of desperation and revenge as darkly funny as it is tragically bleak, ""Three Billboards"" pushing characters far beyond their traditional archetypes. The movie is one of the angriest films in recent memory and a wonderful dark comedy. It has moments of hilarious comedy and sincere tenderness, along with acts of nearly unwatchable violence. Despite Martin McDonagh's magnificently rich story filled with complexities and twisting turns and the well written dialogues, it's the strength of the performances from Frances McDormand (whose expressive eyes show every thought and capture the depths of her pain), Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell that keeps ""Three Billboards"" up.

"MovieSoup","10","4","8","19 January 2018"," The Best Movie Of 2017!!
","I have now watched this film twice and I can honestly say that it is perfect in everyway. Im going to try and explain why this movie is great but my explaining could not really do justice to this film. This film has all the key things a film has to have to be great like a strong engageing plot, strong characters, great camera work, great sound track all of it. <br/><br/>I will try and not spoil the plot but it starts with a mothers attempt to stir the police of her town into finding her daughter's killer. From there the film leads a dark path of vengence that is very humorous at times as well as heart breaking. The scrip was written by Martin McDonagh who wrote and directed two of my favourite films. This is his third film and honestly it is his best work. He brings his a game in the direction, story writing and camera direction. Honestly the man, in my opinion, is the best director working at the moment. <br/><br/>Not only is the director brilliant with loads of development and twists but the cast is stella and Frances McDormand is THE BEST part of this film. Her portrayal of Mildred is awesome and made me feel for her character and what she goes through. I can say the same for Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell. Sam Rockwell actually has the most character development. He changes from an a**hole into probably the best character. The way he portrays this change in the character is inspired and has cemented him, in my mind, as a fantastic actor. <br/><br/>The way Harrelson plays the cheif of police and the masterful way he develops this character and breaths life into the part McDonagh has written is beyond brilliant. Then you have a great supporting cast that adds background colour. I even loved the guy who put up the billboards AND HE WAS IN TWO SCENES!!!!
 
The Two main strenghts of this film are the plot and performances which i can't say enough good things about. However the technical side is masterful with great cinematography, beautiful sweeping shots shots and the scene with Rockwell in the advertisers office is a masterclass in camera work for anyone. It actually looks like it was done in one take however im not sure if it was or not. Again great work and very enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>The use of popular music is very characteristic of McDonagh and is used to great effect in especially the advertiser scene with Rockwell. I loved that iit captured the mood of the characters an their actions so well. Honestly Im running out of different ways to praise this movie.<br/><br/>You know that annoying friend who is like ""Dude you NEED to watch this film"". Honestly if he is talking about this one PLEASE for the love of god listen to him it is that good. Hence why it is a 10\10 from me."
"breheneyjames","10","4","8","19 January 2018"," Vintage Martin McDonagh... A Masterpiece.
","Every now and then a film comes out that lives up to all its pre-release hype and reputation and then some. 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is absolutely one of those films. From the opening credits to the end I was continually impressed and taken aback by this movie at virtually all levels - From the outstanding performances to the raw and darkly funny screenplay to the wonderful score by Carter Burwell - Who incidentally composed one of my favorite western themes for the Coen Brother's ""True Grit"". Already being a fan of Martin McDonagh, it wasn't difficult for me to believe the people raving about this movie on the festival circuit. He is easily one of the best auteurs working today which might be helped by him being a successful former playwright. McDonagh writes and directs this film and injects it with his signature cynicism and black comedy. It just so happens that he also assembled the perfect cast led by essentially the Queen of black comedy Frances McDormand to knock it out of the park. Even though McDonagh's feature debut 'In Bruges' is perfect in my opinion, I also think 'Three Billboards' might just be his best work to date.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a mother named Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) who challenges the local police department specifically the chief of police Willoughby (Woody Harrellson) after her daughter's brutal rape and murder goes unsolved for eight months, by putting up three provocative billboards outside town. This surely captures the attention of the police including one of Willoughby's officers, the racist and all round loathsome Dickson (Sam Rockwell). What follows is plenty of twists of turns that come completely unexpectedly that I will no spoil here of course. One of the biggest achievements of McDonagh's screenplay is the complex nature of all characters in the movie. Everyone is three-dimensional here, they all have flaws and they all have moments where you root for them- Very impressive when one of the characters namely Dickson is accused of torturing 'black folk' in the past. But even the protagonist Mildred does some very questionable things throughout the story.<br/><br/>As I mentioned I absolutely love the score by Burwell which evokes Ennio Morricone's themes of the classic spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. It helps set the tone from the opening shots of the three billboards and the long winding decommissioned road that runs alongside them. The editing by Jon Gregory is also very effective in creating suspense in certain scenes and nailing comedic timing in others.<br/><br/>One of the strongest elements of 'Three Billboards', of which there are many, is definitely the performances by the stellar cast. It is a true ensemble and probably the best one of 2017. Frances McDormand is ferocious and commanding as Mildred Hayes and she portrays her sorrow, guilt and search for justice very believably. Sam Rockwell although billed as a supporting character is pretty much a co-lead as he gets the most screen time second only to McDormand. This is probably his best role to date and it allows him to show his range as a character who in other movies would have just been reduced to a stereotype but emerges full bodied in this one. Woody Harrelson as family man and local police chief Willoughby also has a great showing and is in some of the funniest and most tragic scenes in the film - The several scenes in which his voice-over reads out a letter to certain characters spring to mind. The cast is rounded out with notable turns by a remarkable supporting cast including Caleb Landry Jones, Lucas Hedges, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes and Samara Weaving.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Martin McDonagh has created something truly special with 'Three Billboards' which is in tragic and heartbreaking in equal measure and is hands down the best film of 2017."

","Diane and I saw this brilliant film yesterday; it is a film that will not dissipate from our minds like a morning fog when the sun begins to shine. Both of us found the movie something that will remain in our thought for a long time.<br/><br/>In commenting on the film, the first thing that comes to mind is the richness of the pool of acting talent that becomes available to the director. The first is the Little person, besides the leads, he steals the screen whenever he appears. The mother of the ""bad guy"" takes scenes equally quickly. In short, the Director placed marvellous actors in all the roles needed; there were no soft spots where actors regardless of screen time were felt by the viewers to be ""playing"" at their roles.<br/><br/>Finally the mains: the actors that wrestled with the primary roles. The primary sources have had a field day distributing well-deserved accolades to all the great actors spread throughout the movie.

There is not a single scene which will make us think, oh can this really happen? The background music is nicely put.

"ginocox-206-336968","4","4","8","9 January 2018"," Incoherent political commentary mars stellar performance by Harrelson
","""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" offers a few laugh-out-loud moments, a nuanced performance by Woody Harrelson, some interesting plot reversals and unexpected developments. It's touted as a black comedy, but is not nearly as consistently amusing in its absurdity as ""Burn After Reading,"" which also starred Frances McDormand and had a similar seriocomic tone. <br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the film tries to be relevant and political, touching on serious matters, such as spousal abuse, police brutality, unequal treatment of black suspects by police, vigilantism, political activism and other social issues. The cast is inclusive, with a sixty-year-old actress as the protagonist, blacks in two key roles, a dwarf and a character who may have repressed homosexual tendencies. It takes feminist digs at men who leave their wives for bimbos a third their age and seems to allude to some of the Obama-era consent agreements for police department oversight. It even has an extended scene that Snyder would term dog-petting, with a fawn. Frightfully relevant fare, but not particularly amusing. <br/><br/>To work all these diverse social issues into the story, the characters often behave in manners that make very little sense, if anybody stops to think about it. Unfortunately, the pace is a bit ponderous for much of the film and willful suspension of disbelief is routinely disrupted by excessive reliance on jiggly-cam shots, giving the audience ample opportunity to notice the incongruities. <br/><br/>The role that suffers the most is McDormand's Mildred, who sets out to right a grievous injustice, but commits a series of violent anti-social acts that make her seem nearly as morally bankrupt and contemptible as the individual she wants to bring to justice. She has received considerable praise for her performance as a strong woman, but her actions (including an incomplete conspiracy in the final scene), would seem to justify some of the invectives hurled at her character by the ex-husband, daughter, son and other characters. Her performance is largely single-note. Her character displays about as much remorse for her actions as the Only Black Lives Matter urban terrorists display for their acts of physical assault, arson and vigilante assassination. That the film tacitly condones her acts and this character is being singled out as some sort of cinematic role model is a sad commentary on society. <br/><br/>A good drama or comedy should have a strong moral. The protagonist should confront some obstacle that proves insurmountable until he or she learns some valuable lesson about life and somehow becomes a better person. The moral to this movie is stated in a letter written by Willoughby (Harrelson) to Dixon (Rockwell), but no character follows the advice. Mildred becomes more forgiving and patient in one aspect of her life, but perhaps not in another. Social issues, like police brutality and vigilante assaults on police officers are touched upon, but largely for comedic effect. Often, characters seem to behave in irrational manners in order to make some incoherent political statement. <br/><br/>McDormand also had a supporting role in John Sayles's ""Lone Star,"" which was a highly effective drama/mystery that explored various social issues and which had a diverse cast. But the social issues were seamlessly woven into the plot of LS and presented from various viewpoints without bias. In TBOEM, the social issues seemed tacked on and the plot and character motivations seem contrived to highlight them. <br/><br/>Even the titular billboards seem contrived. Five thousand dollars per month would seem excessive, even for billboards in the heart of a city with slightly over a thousand residents. Considering that the billboards were disused and hadn't generated any income in several decades, she probably could have gotten the billboards for much less, perhaps as little as $100/month each or $250 for the three, and why wouldn't they accept it? (Why a city the size of Billings even has a company specializing in outdoor advertising is also a mystery.) Simple two-color printing job with no artwork. Pitch it as a PSA, get the price for vinyl sheets down to $500, if not for free. A couple of hundred to hang the sheets. Donald Trump could have gotten the billboards for a year for $5,000. But $250/month doesn't have dramatic weight, gravitas. At $5,000, she has to sell her truck and scrounging up the rent for the following month becomes a significant obstacle - not realistic, but significant. <br/><br/>But the filmmakers wouldn't want Mildred to behave like Donald Trump. Instead, she behaves like staunch fiscal conservatives regard liberals as behaving, by tossing excessive money at a situation others don't even regard as a problem; with no reason to believe the expenditure will produce any positive results, without even trying to get the best, most cost-effective deal or waiting for a quote before giving her best offer, and belligerently insisting on continuing the effort, even when the results seem to cause nothing but problems with no discernable benefit. <br/><br/>Rather than a heroic character, Mildred seems a cynical caricature of liberals."

","""Raped while Dying.
Still no arrests.
How come, chief Willoughby?""<br/><br/>Those who read my writing attempts occasionally, know that I thoroughly hate everything that has the appearance of a serial or when prequels and sequels are being produced just to exploit the story even further. So, don't panic while reading the following statement. I hope they'll come up with a sequel to ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"". A continuation of this brilliant story where we'll learn how Mildred (Frances McDormand) and Dixon (Sam Rockwell) handle the case. I am sure that this film will be difficult to surpass in its genre. And not because of some amazing special effects or action-packed film sequences. But because of the ingenious story and the unparalleled acting. And even though the story is filled with ultra-serious issues such as discrimination, domestic violence, cancer, sexual abuse and murder, there's also a subtle comic layer that is saturated with blackened humor and finished with cynical and ironic elements. This is so up my alley.<br/><br/>""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is about anger, rage and helplessness. The anger about an unsolved case with Angela, the daughter of Mildred, being raped and burned alive by one or more unknowns. And after several months Mildred has come up with the bright idea to denounce the failure of the judicial investigation. And this by unabashedly spreading the message about it, on three billboards with Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) as main target, solely because of his leading position as Chief. But it's not only anger and revenge you'll be witnessing in this magnificent film. Forgiveness is also included. Like the moment during a police interrogation in which Mildred feels genuinely concerned about Willoughby's health. I was also surprised when Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones), the owner of the advertising billboards, offers Dixon a glass of orange juice. Two moments in which blind anger made room for compassion.<br/><br/>Even though Woody's name is written on the billboard in huge letters, his contribution isn't really decisive. To my surprise, he also gets out of the picture halfway through the film. In the first place it's Frances McDormand who demands the most attention. And she does that in a stunning way. A bitter woman who's tired of waiting for an arrest. Mildred is under the assumption that no effort is made by the corps to follow any clue or performs real police work. In her eyes, the police officers are a group of racist dipshits who spend their days harassing Afro-American fellow citizens. She's a tough lady who firmly tackles those who get in her way, both verbally and physically. And she spares nobody. Whether it's a priest or a dentist. She isn't even afraid to kick some young students in their crotch. And even though she appears to be an unpleasant person with a sharp tongue, she manages to arouse your sympathy. The sometimes dry, humorous remarks take care of that. Frances McDormand may rightfully become the owner of the coveted statue during the Academy Awards in a few months' time.<br/><br/>And such a golden statue can also be reserved for Sam Rockwell. His acting is simply magisterial. Dixon is an aggressive hillybilly who likes to beat up minorities and appears to be drunk constantly while doing his job as a policeman, knowing it's tolerated by his superior. A not so quite intellectual overweight man. And Dixon's stupidity sometimes creates comical situations. And finally there's Woody Harrelson. An actor after my own heart (whom had stolen it already because of his participation in the sitcom ""Cheers"") who always plays his roles with so much flexibility and professionalism. In contrast to the confused and sometimes cruel character from ""The Glass Castle"", Chief Willoughby is an honest person who's sincerely worried about the case of Mildred's daughter. All in all, these are three parts that are played in an excellent and marvelous way by these actors. This film is already commendable because of that.<br/><br/>But it is also the intelligently written script that makes this film worthwhile. It's indeed a film full of heavy themes. The injustice in this world and how people deal with it. The processing of an immense grief. And there are also uncomfortable moments full of aggression and threats. And yet there is always a laconic undertone that is peppered with thoughtful, ambiguous humor. And these different moods alternate at breakneck speed. Some scenes change from aggressive and threatening, into humorous and emotional. ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a gem of a film I've enjoyed tremendously. And believe me, I'm looking forward to seeing it once more.

","I love a movie that avoids having flat, token characters, and 3 Billboards is a great example of a movie with nuance and exceptional acting in dealing with tricky and complex themes. The way McDormand delves into many aspects of justice was very well done, and the ambiguous nature of characters and their intentions are well developed. Extremely enjoyable to watch, each second of dialogue and footage you're on the edge of your seat, wondering what the characters will do next. Very well done on all fronts."
"The-Sarkologist","8","4","8","6 January 2018"," The Human Side of the Small Town
","I'm not really all that sure why I went and saw this film, but from the trailers it sounded interesting, and also somewhat dark, and funny, at the same time (a black comedy if you will). The first thing that I should mention is that I haven't seen a film like this for a while, where the ending is incredibly ambiguous (as it should be), and that it doesn't follow the average Hollywood cookie cutter format. Okay, while I'm not as much into independent films as I used to be, seeing something that is a little different once in a while does break the monotony of what happens to be a steadily degrading trend in modern movies.
 The film is about a mother who lost her daughter when she was raped and murdered on her way home. This is small town America in the deep south, so you could say that the average educational level of most people here is not very high, and it certain shows it. In fact, until another police officer arrives from out of town, you could say that the average intelligence of this place is not incredibly high. However, this isn't a film where we end up laughing at 'stupid' people because we happen to be intellectual snobs, but rather a film that takes us on a journey through their lives and discover that even though they may be nothing like us educated city dwellers, they are still humans with hurts and fears just like us.
 Frustrated as the fact that the police are doing very little to progress the case, our protagonist, Mildred, has an idea - she rents three billboards on the outskirts of the town along a stretch of road that basically only she uses. She then pastes some simple messages challenging the police as to why they haven't caught anybody yet. This, not surprisingly, causes a bit of a stir in the town, and in a way it seems that she is the only person who is frustrated by the lack of action, or convictions, because the town seems to be siding with the police. Well, once again not surprising considering the chief is not only well respected, but also dying of cancer.
 This film touches on few ideas, including the limits of police power and the desire of a victim or their relatives wanting to see justice down. As the police chief says: sometimes it is just impossible to find the culprit, and they may go for years not knowing anything until somebody over hears a braggart in a diner and the culprit is suddenly arrested. In a way this shows the dichotomy of humans, in that on one hand they want protections against police abusing their power, but for the police to have unlimited power when they become the victim. As long as it is somebody else that is being chased then that is okay.
 The other thing that struck me is the human element of the film. Sure, this is set in a very conservative part of the United States, a place where outsiders and people of colour are still treated with suspicion. Yet what we are struck with is the human side of these people, how they love and cry, how they hurt, and fight against each other. It is easy for us to simply write of this section of society as a bunch of idiots who have no idea about the problems that the world is facing, yet they are still human. In a way this film is attempting to bridge that gap between the left and the right, the intellectuals and the average Republican voter. It is easy for us to look down on them, and we certainly do, making accusations such as them voting against their own interests, and destroying the American state. Yet they are people, and it is easy for us to forget their humanity.
 One thing that stands out is their ability to forgive, and this is something that many of us on the left really don't know how do to. There are events in this film that would raise the ire of many, and leave to a long lasting split in friendships, yet it seems that the one thing that they seek is to mend those friendships. Somebody gets thrown out of a window in a fit on anger, yet the victim forgives the person who throws him out of the window, even though no apology was offered. In a way there is too much hate in this world, and not enough forgiveness. In one sense, by reaching out, offering a hand of friendship, and showing somebody that we forgive we can start to heal some of those wounds, and in turn seek a way forward."

"bob-the-movie-man","9","4","8","3 January 2018"," ""Anger Begets Greater Anger""
","What is it? A black-comedy drama. But my fear would be that with such an 'art-house' title, it's going to put a lot of people off. But it really really shouldn't. FOR THIS IS A GEM OF A MOVIE... and so, so entertaining that two hours just sped by.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand (""Hail Caesar"", ""Fargo"") plays a mother - Mildred Hayes - in pain. Her daughter Angela (Kathryn Newton) has been raped, set alight and murdered (so clearly LOL territory!) After ten months and no culprit arrested, she takes things into her own hands by renting the three billboards in question and posting a message to the local police chief, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"").<br/><br/>But the popular Chief Willoughby has his own problems, setting many in the town on a collision course with the feisty Mildred as tempers flare. Stoking the flames is the racist, unstable and unpredictable Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell, ""Moon""). The billboard advertiser Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones, ""Get Out"") is uncomfortably caught in the middle of the battle. <br/><br/>In terms of the story, nothing in this film goes in the direction you expect. Willoughby's reaction to the crisis is extraordinary... in a good way. Dixon's reaction is also extraordinary for different reasons! Red herrings are scattered throughout the script to further set you off balance.<br/><br/>The film reminded me greatly of ""Manchester By The Sea"", and not just because Lucas Hedges (as Mildred's grieving and uncomfortable son) is again playing a very similar role. There is gut-wrenching drama, but diffused in the blink-of-an-eye by laugh-out-loud dialogue. Whereas ""Manchester"" could perhaps be described as a drama with black comedy, ""Three Billboards"" is probably better described as a black comedy with drama. But the comedy is dark, oh, so very dark! Some of the lines are so outrageous (both in terms of language used - very extreme - and the racial/homophobic nature of it) that you are sometimes uncertain whether you should be laughing at all. But it's been brilliantly balanced and orchestrated.<br/><br/>As I commented in ""Battle of the Sexes"" the Screen Actors Guild Award for ""Best Ensemble Cast"" is one of my favourite categories of award, and I thought that film should have been nominated (it wasn't)! But the ensemble cast in ""Three Billboards"" is another great example, and this one IS nominated! (Hoorah!) For this whole town just LIVES AND BREATHES, thanks to the combined efforts of the cast: as well as the lead names, the cast includes Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones"") as a diminutive used car salesman; Caleb Landry Jones as Red Welby; Zeljko Ivanek as the police desk sergeant; Amanda Warren (""mother!"") as Mildred's put-upon co-worker and (particularly) Sandy Martin as Dixon's wizened and cranky old mother. All are fed with great lines and scenes to bring the story alive. <br/><br/>At the helm is writer/director (and London-born!) Martin McDonagh (""In Bruges"", ""Seven Psychopaths"") and he delivers genius. I recently cruelly made fun of the writers of the awful ""Pitch Perfect 3"" for not coming up with any sort of viable plot. Here I am at the other extreme, in awe of how someone can sit down with a blank piece of paper and come out with this story, these characters and this dialogue. It would be foolish so early in the season to predict the Oscars, but here must be a great candidate for Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>Elsewhere I would see Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson both as Oscar nominees for Best Actress/Actor and Sam Rockwell is surely a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this.... I wonder what odds I can get for a win? Jason Dixon (is this perhaps a pun because he always keeps crossing ""the line""?!) will I think be one of the most memorable characters for me in the cinema this year: a character you can despise, pity and even strangely admire at stages throughout the two hours. Something that Rockwell balances with consummate skill.<br/><br/>In terms of my one criticism, the script (in my opinion) rather over-eggs the pudding in the last ten minutes, stepping over into actions I didn't find realistic. It was a nice ending when it came, but not one I felt invested in. So I'm going to put my (rarely used) '10*' back in my pocket, and instead rate this one just a tad lower. But regardless of that, ignore the title and GO AND SEE THIS ONE! <br/><br/>(Just a final note for those severely affected by the subject matter: while there is some significant violence in the film, the rape is not shown - i.e. there are no ""flashback"" scenes, apart from some - very brief - corpse photos in a folder Willoughby looks through).<br/><br/>(For the full graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

","Frances McDormand's performance is pretty good, but not as good as some say. maybe it's the way the character is written. Sam Rockwell is the best thing in the movie. He's at times funny because of his ignorance (the ignorance of his character, that is), and at times horrible in his ignorance. What bothered me was that these two characters are ultimately ready to kill any man whom they suspect of any crime against anybody - without proof, without trial, just condemn him and kill him. That's as evil as what happened to her daughter. This film teaches that it's okay to behave like this - kill any man you think is nasty. He doesn't have to have done anything bad, he doesn't have to have committed a crime. Go ahead and kill him. What does it matter? He's just a worthless man."
"MickGuinn","9","6","14","7 December 2017"," Surprisingly Appalling and Funny
","""3 Billboards,"" as it should have simply been titled (not like we'll confuse it with all of the other films of that title...), was a surprising treat I might never have seen. It looked too dark and violent for my monthly dinner and a movie night with a buddy. We usually confine our nights out to comic book violence (if any) while avoiding the tender films our wives want to see with us. But on a Monday night, in early December, there was nothing else to see. <br/><br/>""Slim pickings,"" he texted me. ""Skip the movie and just have dinner together?,"" he asked. <br/><br/>My quick check of Flixster indicated the same, except for this film I'd not heard of. It had high critical ratings, but that doesn't always mean it's something enjoyable for non-film critics, so I was encouraged by high User ratings too. We decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>How lucky was that? Lucky. :-)<br/><br/>It's a truly great, interesting, disturbing, funny and unpredictable film I might never have seen otherwise.<br/><br/>This is not a Cohen Brothers. film. It's written and directed by Martin McDonagh. But there is an ambiance that invites comparison (McDonagh has most certainly been at a few Co-Bro screenings) and a cast so good they could phone it in for either director. For me, the Cohen Bros are hit and miss in terms of watchability. Yes, everything they do is gold, I know. Sigh. But some of it is too violent and stomach turning. They like to paint their horrors far too graphically for my tastes. Perhaps it's supposed to be wry, funny or ironic, but for me, the world is already full of those horrors. I don't need more haunting my dreamscape. <br/><br/>""3 Billboards"" brought me right to the edge of my squeamishness without having to hang over the balcony with dry heaves. (Um,probably could have come up with a less graphic metaphor) <br/><br/>Frances McDormand is outstanding. <br/><br/>I can't see how she will NOT get an Oscar nomination for this role. I couldn't take my eyes off her face and was never sure what Mildred was going to do next. She's nearly fearless in facing down foes in this film. But she's also flawed and says things she clearly regrets. The last scene we see with Mildred and her daughter yelling at each other is brutal. Knowing Mildred shouted, ""I hope you get raped!"" as the last thing she said to her before that very thing happens and she's brutally murdered? It leaves a horrible, guilty silence in the room and the stomach. We can see Mildred carry this weight through the rest of the film. There's no attempt to make the daughter an angel either and that made everything make sense to me. All of these characters are looking for some kind of redemption and everyone has their own personal list of demons to slay.<br/><br/>Even though his performance is likely to be overlooked, Lucas Hedges, who plays Mildred's son, Robbie, it solid throughout. We see his embarrassment and pride in his mother subtly woven into his facial reactions, silent or otherwise. He's one of the rare leads in the film that doesn't appear to need redeeming.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson will definitely have the Academy looking at their work as well. This movie is nothing if not a character study. Who we think everyone is in beginning, is not who they reveal themselves to be by the end. Strange bedfellows allows this film to avoid a lot of the clichés that might have otherwise permeated the writing. <br/><br/>Are there a few plot holes and unexplained moments? Of course there are. The selective enforcement of law in this town is mysterious to say the least. <br/><br/>But I'm also aware this film is, in many ways, a stage play too. Without trying to sound terribly obvious, I felt the plot was really a device to hold characters' feet (sometimes literally) to the fire. It's enjoyable to watch a film that's in such good hands but doesn't reveal where it's going. <br/><br/>While I understood the decision to leave our 2 unlikely allies on the road together wondering if they should kill the rapist whose DNA did not link him to the Ebbing killing, I would still have enjoyed watching more of that journey and possible confrontation. It's almost like McDonagh could make a second film that begins in the car where the movie ends. I think he'd still have plenty to entertain us with. At the very least, perhaps we could explain the very tense meeting in the gift shop and why this rapist from out of state seemed to hate Mildred to the point of an intentionally hostile confrontation (which she's ironically rescued from by the dead sheriff's widow!).<br/><br/>Speaking of Harrelson's Sheriff, Willoughby ends up being surprisingly more sympathetic than expected. The Sheriff's voiceovers and letters are a nice touch for some of that unforeseen information. Rockwell is pathetic and disgusting as Dixon, the dim witted alcoholic, white trash/racist cop who is partially redeemed(?) in the fires. His chain smoking, white trashy mother, played perfectly by Sandy Martin, is almost more creepy than Dixon. Martin nails it. All of the scenes with her leave one wanting to run from the disgusting smoke, booze and world view. <br/><br/>There are many notable performances and Caleb Landry Jones (who plays Red, the guy leasing the billboards) is another that seemed to refreshingly avoid clichés. In some ways, he is the beginning of the ""forgiveness"" of Dixon.<br/><br/>3 Billboards makes me wish I was in film school so we could discuss the characters and their choices in greater depth. <br/><br/>Not a bad thing when I film does that. <br/><br/>Not bad at all. :-)"

","Seen at the Viennale 2017: writing reviews about several movies in the last year, I nearly have to pass on this one. Three Billboards is of such high quality that it is nearly impossible to comment on it. Only highly professional reviewers should dare to write something about such high quality script, directing and cast. Why not ten stars, then? We still have to see, whether this one will become a classic movie for the Top 200. Maybe, it will. For sure it earns such a high rating. Three Billboards touches soul and heart from 10 minutes after the beginning up to the end. Seldom I changed from laughing to sadness in such a high frequency. But the movies greatest strength is: it gives hope. Hope in the possibility that people can change from the worse to the better. People are changing in this movie. People can change in real life. We get remembered that this is possible. For sure, I will never forget the highly emotional moment, when Dixon risks his life by grabbing the burning crime file of Hayes and jumps through the fire wall. This movie deserves every single Oscar it will (hopefully) get."

I just didn't enjoy it. I found her character to be totally unlikeable and the ""black humour"" didn't work at all for me. To me, this was just a lot of violence.

A loathsome character, with lots of flaws but ultimately redeemable. Woody Harrelson was his usual laconic joy to watch and keeps getting better.
It might be a tough watch, with barely a character that is endearing or somebody you can connect with, but stick with it, as the layers are peeled away their characters are revealed for what they really are

"howard.schumann","9","5","11","3 December 2017"," A wild, mostly improbable but highly entertaining ride
","Martin McDonagh's (""Seven Psychopaths"") Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a mix of black (and politically incorrect) comedy and heartfelt drama that takes us on a wild, mostly improbable but highly entertaining ride. Set in the fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri, Frances McDormand (""Hail, Caesar!""), who carries the film in one of her best roles, is the recently-divorced Mildred Hayes, a feisty, angry, depressed, but very determined woman with a warrior mentality who lost her daughter Angela only seven months ago in a rape and murder that still has not been solved. <br/><br/>To make things worse, her abusive husband Charlie (John Hawkes, ""Everest"") has left her for a dim nineteen-year-old zoo attendant, and her son Robbie (Lucas Hedges, ""Manchester by the Sea"") just wants to forget the past and get on with his life. Instead of carrying placards and marching in front of the police station the way many people might protest, Mildred catches sight of three dilapidated billboards along an old highway leading into town that have not been used since Superman peanut butter was all the rage. With the help of Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones, ""The Florida Project"") who runs the local advertising agency, she rents the billboards and plasters signs on them in flaming red that carry the messages: : ""Raped While Dying"", ""And Still No Arrests"", ""How Come Chief Willoughby?"" Her stated purpose is ""to concentrate the mind, some.""<br/><br/>The Willoughby referred to is Ebbing's Police Chief played by Woody Harrelson (""War for the Planet of the Apes"") who masks a soft heart with a veneer of toughness. Willoughby, who suffers from advanced cancer, takes the opportunity to visit Mildred and take her through what has actually been done on the case. Bottom line, the police are doing everything they can but there are no suspects and nothing has been learned from the DNA evidence. The ensuing media circus, however, brings out the worst in people, many who come to the chief's defense, especially police deputy Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell, ""The Way Way Back""), an unabashed white racist who lives with his overbearing mother (Sandy Martin). <br/><br/>Mildred behaves irrationally in her single-minded quest for justice/revenge, at one point tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station and kicking high schoolers in the groin (neither of which resulted in any punishment), yet Dixon's over-the-top antics top hers tenfold. In one scene, he leaves his desk to go to the ad agency across the street to exact vengeance on the unsuspecting Red. There is also tons of snarky dialogue and condescending put-downs, some clever, others not so much, but McDonagh can see the good in people and works to make that available to the viewer.<br/><br/>At a key moment, the characters recognize each other, not as protagonists in the midst of battle, but as human beings and the film becomes more about the complexities of the human condition than the eccentricities of its colorful characters. Willoughby is as frustrated as Mildred by the lack of results in Angela's death but tries to camouflage it with reassuring talk. On her part, Mildred comforts Willoughby when he coughs up blood that splatters in her face, and the vengeance that is eating away at her is, at least momentarily, replaced by compassion. <br/><br/>Even Dixon shows character growth after a violent outburst separates him from his job. While not much of what happens in the film can be confused with reality, what is real is the residue of decency present in even the most hard-edged characters. What is also real, unfortunately, is the not too startling revelation of how the prevailing police culture often results in violence against women going unpunished. GRADE: B+"
"RNDorrell","9","5","11","27 November 2017"," McDormand leads a trio of incredible performances
","Director Martin McDonagh is a playwright by main trade, so he directs, and writes, films with great, pointed, nimble dialogue. He wrote and directed ""In Bruges,"" and ""Seven Psychopaths."" He outdoes himself with this script, which is chock full of acid repartee and blistering verbal exchanges. The film tells a story weighted with heavy emotional freight, but does so with so many hilarious moments of dark comedy that when the downer emotional interludes roll around again, you're trying to catch up and reset your face: laughter clouds into sober reflection of harsh situations, then here comes the laughter again.<br/><br/>That pendulum effect is thanks to three masterful performances: Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, caught up in the festering pain over a violent murder, in a (fictional) small Missouri town. McDormand plays Mildred Hayes, divorcée, whose daughter was killed 7 months earlier, and her disgust with the lack of progress by the local police in investigating the crime eventually boils over into protest and outright militancy. McDormand's set-jaw grit here is captivating. It's been 20 years since her Oscar for ""Fargo,"" and this role makes her a shoe-in for another nomination. You cheer her on in every move she makes, even when she crosses the line into vigilantism. Fed up with waiting for her daughter's killers to be caught, she rents three decrepit billboards on a sleepy stretch of blacktop outside town, and has them emblazoned with an accusatory question aimed squarely at the town's Chief of Police Willoughby (Harrelson, intelligent, wryly funny, genuinely principled, and going through a personal crisis of his own). A member of his force, Officer Dixon (Rockwell, playing the dullard, yokel, racist cop routine to drawling, violent, moronic perfection, lords but he's good), takes the billboards as a frontal attack on the police force, a slight he has no intention of letting slide, despite the fact Mildred is clearly within her free speech rights in having posted the message they carry.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are also great. Caleb Landry Jones plays Red, the billboard ad salesman, young, hesitant, a bit vulnerable. Lucas Hedges plays Mildred's son, Robbie, mortified at his mom's activist behavior, but ultimately on her side, and also deeply damaged by his sister's killing. The police desk sergeant is cleverly played by Zeljko Ivanek, he frequently winces over Dixon's astonishing stupidity. Sandy Martin plays Dixon's ethically challenged hick mother with notes of frightening credibility. Peter Dinklage puts in a sly performance as the ""town midget,"" a very decent, smart guy who befriends Mildred. Short of stature or not, Dinklage is one very good actor. John Hawkes, from ""Deadwood,"" plays Mildred's sour ex husband, he turns in some well-charged scenes. Clark Peters, from ""The Wire,"" plays a senior cop who takes over the Ebbing police station after a series of events has sent it into chaos. Nick Searcy plays a venal, condescending local priest, whom Mildred totally verbally stiff-arms, comparing him to a gang member and inviting him to finish his tea and then ""get the f--k out of my kitchen.""<br/><br/>There are a couple of nit-picky details in the plot that make no sense (the full-size fire extinguisher just happening to be handy in the station wagon, and the threatening, but disconnected, menace of a stranger's visit to Mildred's gift shop), but they're minor annoyances in the scheme of a script brimming with emotional intelligence, a rarity in modern movie houses. The partnership that develops at the end is also extremely odd, and their plan is more than slightly vague, not to mention morally flawed, but the film's basic message seems to override that by earnestly saying: grief can destroy you, but grief coupled with inaction will drive you insane, and then destroy you. Great movie."

","Frances McDormand is clearly into character as she portrays a deeply sad but resigned mother with a goal.
Her goal is to upset anyone that can help her find the monster who killed her daughter, and she brilliantly succeed at it when one after the other, they come to either 'ask nicely' to get rid of the billboards; openly scare-the-hell out of her at her workplace or simply threaten her as a tactical move to basically make the billboards disappear.
But as strong as a mother can be, she just carries on the promise she made to herself and to her too-soon departed girl; and do whatever it takes to get answers.<br/><br/>The only trailer I've seen is full of sharply-written dialogue and outrageous one-off quotes, which fortunately the film is filled with all the way.
It doesn't feel long, nor short. All the secondary characters are developed and bring something to the story.

","Review:
Every now and again, a low budget movie comes along that exceeds expectation, which this movie certainly did. I personally found it entertaining throughout, and the performances from McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson were brilliant. The storyline was also well put together but I was slightly disappointed with the ending. Although the subject matter was quite serious, the witty script made it a joy to watch, in a black comedy type of way, and it really does prove that you don't have to have a huge budget to make an entertaining movie. Anyway, the movie is about a mother, Mildred (Frances McDormand) who has become a recluse after her daughter is brutally murdered. After waiting 7 months for the police to come up with some results, she decides to take matters into her own hands by putting ""RAPED WHILE DYING"", ""STILL NO ARRESTS"" and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?"" on three billboards, hence the title. The billboards upset a lot of people in her small town, including Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), and officer Jason Dixon who is a racist and a violent alcoholic. As Bill was unable to solve the case, he is pushed to investigate the murder again, after the billboards cause a huge impact in the town. Whilst suffering with pancreatic cancer, Bill decides to take his own life after finding out that the cancer has progressed, which leaves Mildred with no answers about her daughter. After another violent event, Jason is sacked from the police but he decides to look into the murder after reading a note that Bill left him before he committed suicide. Out of frustration, Mildred decides to burn down the police station, not knowing that Jason is inside but he manages to escape with severe burns around his body. Whilst in a bar, Jason hears a man bragging to his friend about being with a girl around the time Mildred's daughter was killed, so he gets into a fight with him to try and get his DNA. After finding out that the DNA didn't match, Mildred is left with no leads but she is still determined to find out what happened to her daughter, even though everyone is telling her to drop it. Frances McDormand was perfect for her role, along with Sam Rockwell who was funny throughout. The cinematography was also perfect for the movie and the various cameos were great additions to this unique movie. It could have easily been a depressing, downbeat film because of it's emotional backdrop, which is why I was surprised with the outcome. Because of the amount of awards that this movie received, I hope that other directors follow suit, especially in this day and age of loads of sequels and remakes. A great watch!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Martin McDonagh, who also brought you In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. Judging by his previous movies, Martin is definitely one for dark comedies but I doubt that he was expecting such a success with this movie. With Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell winning Academy awards for there roles in this film, which they thoroughly deserved, I can't wait to see what this director will come up with next. <br/><br/>Budget: $12million
Worldwide Gross: $158.6million<br/><br/>Genre: Crime, Drama
Cast: Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Caleb Landry Jones, Kerry Condon, Alejandro Barrios, Zeljko Ivanek, Peter Dinklage, Amanda Warren, Sandy Martin, John Hawkes, Clarke Peters and Samara Weaving. 8/10"

","The acting is top notch...hopefully the reason Three Billboards was up for several awards. This is really the only positive thing I can say about the film. I suspect the writer/director never stepped foot in Missouri. He didn't even film the movie there. He paints a picture of a town full of uneducated, ill-tempered, reactionary misfits who can't speak a sentence without saying ""ain't"" or ""f___"". There is the stereotypical corrupt, angry, super racist police officer and the whole department has racist leanings. The whole town is aware of this officer yet nothing seems to be done about it, which implies the whole town is full of racists. The main characters react, most often in a violent manner with no worry of consequences, rather than trying to communicate rationally. Hollywood reached a new low by having the main character's children call her names so disrespectful that they cannot be repeated without causing my review to be removed. The only reason I gave this movie a 6 is because it does have entertainment value. Truthfully this film is an insult to those who live in middle America as well as those of us on the East and West Coast who know better. Come on Hollywood, you can do better than this."

","Problems: <br/><br/>1) Contrary to what director McDonagh says in a DVD extra, Dixon (Rockwell) is far from sympathetic, until the end, after he's burned and beaten. He is, rather, a brutish, drunken cretin (and, as such, a source of broad, low humor). <br/><br/>2) It's impossible to believe he wasn't charged and jailed for his crimes against Red Welby (Jones) and his receptionist. <br/><br/>3) Willoughby (Harrelson) is also only marginally sympathetic. He is too often a pig, especially in how he talks to his small daughters (which, for some reason, is supposed to be funny). His belief in Dixon is unfounded and unrealistic. <br/><br/>4) His letters, read in posthumous voice-over, underline the ""moral"" of this story and are thus artifice. This is telling, not showing. The story itself should have shown this. <br/><br/>5) Black humor at times jars against serious content.<br/><br/>6) The film crew is visible in the background on the upstairs landing when Dixon is leaving the sign office. This is inexcusably shoddy and amateurish. The scene should have been reshot. <br/><br/>7) More shoddy amateurishness: Anne (Cornish), Willoughby's wife, looses her southern accent for her native Australian one and, to boot, is too young and pretty for the ugly, bald, middle-aged Harrelson.<br/><br/>8) No sign could have been pasted on the badly burned billboards.<br/><br/>9) Dixon unrealistically ignores a fire raging some feet from him, ignores the heat and light, as he reads Willoughby's letter.
 <br/><br/>10) The timeless theme of love vs. hate, anger vs. peace, is attractive, yes, but not fully, not satisfyingly developed. The movie unravels a bit around the edges. For example, Welby and James (Dinklage) are patently used to represent love and peace, and are thus more artifice. Life is never that simple. Movie is not quite a full glass, but, rather, Â¼ empty.<br/><br/>PS. Once again, the South and American working class are incompletely understood and depicted by an elitist outsider, here a Londoner. This is a substitute, not the real thing, like Eric Clapton miming American blues.<br/><br/>PPS.

The motives of Frances McDormand to challenge the local authorities are understandable as she lost her daughter being raped and murdered because of her actions, the anger and despair of her emotion really did captured my heart. This film also shows that it is a human nature that people will do anything like Sam Rockwell's character Dixon threw Welby out of a window and Frances McDormand's character Mildred set off a fire to burn down the police station while Dixon was in it. This movie is realistic as it does not have a happy ending but they did found out who's the rapist/killer, and the film ends with both Dixon and Mildred deciding whether to kill him along the way.

","Anger has been a problem America has been dealing with the last couple of years. Whether it be political or social, everyone has felt angry about the current state of our nation. Here to shed more light on that topic is Martin McDonagh, writer, and director of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. McDonagh uses his Irish background and dark comedy writing skills to make a film that is both deadly serious and brutally funny. You may find yourself both laughing and crying in this tale of revenge and forgiveness. <br/><br/>Just as you would expect, the film is set in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri. About a year ago, teenager Angela Hayes was raped and murdered. Her case has remained unsolved, much to the dismay of her mother, Mildred (Frances McDormand). Since none of her previous attempts have worked, Mildred decides the best way to call out the police and express her anger is to rent three billboards outside of town (get the title now?). This action quickly captures the attention of the beloved local police chief, Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). What starts out as a small squabble begins to explode into more violent and personal acts between Mildred and the rest of the town. Along for the ride as support are Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage, Lucas Hedges, and Caleb Landry Jones.<br/><br/>McDonagh's film boasts a mega-talented cast that is able to play both sides of the duality between good and evil. He gives all his characters range and memorable traits to keep them interesting to watch. He also perfectly balances the comedy and drama elements within his characters as well. We get to see their rage, but also their compassion. It's a fitting balance for a subject that doesn't have clear areas of right and wrong. <br/><br/>The key part of McDonagh's script is how relatable it is to present day America. The anger each character has are like a symbol for each of us as we battle with the injustices going on in the real world. McDonagh doesn't give us an answer for how to cure our rage but gives us a story so we can see how violence makes everything worse. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, one of the only weak parts of the film is McDonagh's script. It's a good script, but it also has some very clear problems throughout. One of those is some on-the-nose dialogue that feels out of place. He also lets the film get too out of hand and over the top by the end. Events escalate and occur almost too quickly and with little support to warrant their excessiveness. <br/><br/>Cinematographer Ben Davis does a fine job working his camera through the small town of Ebbing. He gives us a city tour while also highlighting the characters that inhabit it. One expert sequence he pulls off is a continuous shot of Sam Rockwell's character breaking down a glass door, walking upstairs into an office, throwing a guy out the window, and then leaving the office while breaking another glass door. <br/><br/>This film and The Shape of Water are in a tight race for the honor of being the best cast of 2017. Frances McDormand delivers an awards capturing performance as a tough mother that has been forced to go to extremes just so she can get the answers she deserves. It's her best role since Fargo and it perfectly plays to her strengths as an actress. She can mix vengeance, snarkiness, and compassion all in the same scene. It's a role only she could play.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell seriously steps us his game to deliver an amazing supporting performance as Dixon, the understudy to Willoughby. Dixon is not like most police officers, he's racist, misogynistic, and just plain mean. Rockwell masterfully blends his comedic skills with intense drama to make his character complex and compelling. He's largely been seen as ""that"" guy in most films, but after this film, people will know and appreciate the talents of Sam Rockwell. <br/><br/>Woody Harrelson gives us his usual country charm with his character Willoughby. It's a character we've seen him play before, but it's a character he knows how to play. <br/><br/>Rounding out the excellent supporting cast is Caleb Landry Jones, who is enjoying a marvelous 2017, and Lucas Hedges, who is also having a really good year. They both do well and aren't completely overshadowed by the leads in their limited roles.<br/><br/>After watching the film, the main idea that makes this film work is the balance. Everybody uses it very well, whether it be McDonagh with his pretty good script or the actors with their masterful performances. As both an entertaining ride and eye-opening experience, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the better films to come out this year."

This film, being good, could have been much better, if I had had a good picture and better directed.<br/><br/>What I like is that it really reflects the American style. It is not a film of forgiveness, quite the opposite. It's a justice movie. If I have to do something to get justice, I do it. The characters adapt to the events. They all ascend the film and go towards their goal.<br/><br/>There are all the great actors, but above all Sam, I liked it a lot. Frances plays a good role, but it's not great. Woody has done better things, but he passes the test.<br/><br/>It has a photograph that could be independent film. He has not bothered to make it interesting.

"DVR_Brale","8","2","3","15 February 2018"," Contains an important message underneath all profanity and mayhem
","This is my more of a commentary on the movie rather than a review. <br/><br/>
Three Billboards is not about those billboards, murder of an innocent girl nor about all the mayhem we encounter throughout the movie. It is not a crime movie as IMDb tag suggests. It's a tragic drama with dark comedy elements which mainly come from one-liners. I think the way this movie ends is a witness to that. <br/><br/>Questions like: Who was the culprit who tortured Mildred's daughter; How did Mildred's relationship with the rest of the city came to be; Did she and Dixon kill supposed rapist at the very end - this and similar question are simply of no importance. If Three Billboards had ended with bringing culprit to justice and delineated details regarding mutual detours from normal citizen relationships, we could have easily thought this was a crime movie about the torture and murder of an innocent girl. That's probably the reason why McDonagh decided to end it somewhat abruptly. <br/><br/>I think this story is about lack of communication which can lead us to believe others are not in the same team as we are, even occupying enemy positions. Three Billboards in a funny and sad way at the same time shows how dangerous that thinking can be. Acting publicly while holding grudges cannot bring anything good. Hence I think Mildred shouldn't have put those billboards at that time - she was to hasty, not giving enough thought about the potential aftermath. Law enforcement responded to her decision to put those billboards very poorly and there you have it - havoc and anger. And we know that anger begets more anger. <br/><br/>Despite enjoying the movie thoroughly, I think some of the scenes and profanities were a bit too quaint. I believe it could've been even better without being so overwhelmingly profane and if Mildred appeared at least a little more feminine. If you don't mind that, you're completely safe to giving it a go. <br/><br/>~ If you found screenwriting and dialogues interesting, check out Birdman if you haven't yet."
"southdavid","6","2","3","24 January 2018"," Killer Performances, confused story.
","Some films are easy to review. You are, after all, just writing down your opinion on something and generally, your opinion is fairly set once the film is over. You were bored, enthralled, amused or repulsed. Your judgement may well differ from others, but at least you know your own. Then along comes a movie like ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" and I'm honestly not sure exactly how I feel about it. <br/><br/>Let's start with the facts. The film stars Francis McDormand as Mildred, a bereaved mother whose daughter was raped and murdered seven months ago. Desperate to keep the case relevant, she rents three billboards near her house and uses them to accuse the local police department, and specifically the Chief, Willougby (Woody Harrelson) of forgetting about the case. The billboards stir up feelings across the town as the police chief is a popular figure. Particularly upset is Deputy Dixon, (Sam Rockwell) who starts to look for ways, inside and outside the law, to have the billboards taken down. <br/><br/>The spine of the film is Francis McDormand's Oscar nominated performance. This is, for me, one of the films first real contradictions. Her performance is brave and unyielding, but it's also showy and obvious. It's feels like it's a role designed to win awards rather than an authentic portrayal of a real person. In fact, authenticity, is something that the movie struggles with across the board. There's an admirable idea related to almost all the characters in the film, that no one is an absolute. Chief Willougby is a good example. He's not ignoring Mildred's case but the evidence has come up with no leads, he's a good family man but tolerates a degree of racism from his officers. <br/><br/>However, these character traits seem at odds with the lack of legitimacy in the beats of the story. There are several scenes of violent crimes being committed, and witnessed, without any genuine consequence, which seriously undercut any sense of realism. Some plot points seem half baked and disappear without any conclusion but the most egregious problem that the film has though is that it doesn't, in any way, earn the redemption of Sam Rockwell's Dixon. Openly and fairly unapologetically racist from the out, he ends the film as the nearest thing the film has to a ""hero"" despite never really repenting or undergoing any character growth. In light of the way the world is in early 2018, it feels horribly out of touch. <br/><br/>The tone of the film is difficult to pin down. It's often funny, with some laugh out loud lines of dialogue but there are other scenes of suicide and menace that are difficult to watch. That said, the films is never less than watchable and none of the performances let the side down. <br/><br/>To conclude, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is a real Curates Egg of a film, but one worth exploring, if only as a character study."
"carlos37andre","8","2","3","11 January 2018"," A great story, with AMAZING performances!
","This movie has highs and lows for me. But waay more highs than lows.<br/><br/>Let's start with the highs. I love almost every single performance on this movie. Everyone is simply great, with FANTASTIC performances especially from Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. They won the Golden Globe, and I wouldn't be surprised if they win the Oscar too. And, come on, it will be fair. Woody Harrelson, and Lucas Hedges (we need to look at this boy more, first Manchester by the Sea, he is on Lady Bird too - I didn't see that yet -, and now this one, the boy is good, has a big future ahead) are also very good on the movie.<br/><br/>The storyline of the movie is intriguing, and keeps you at the edge of your sit almost the entire runtime. I love mainly the first half of the movie, was almost perfect to me, how we get to see how the billboards thing goes, how everyone reacts to it, fantastic. There are some scenes that I really blown away. When they show what's really the only glance of Mildred daughter, when both say ""I hope that you/I are/am raped"" (and this was probably the last time that they see each other) I said out loud ""Holy shit!"", like, my God, this is heavy, makes you think about the way that you might treat your parents (or any member of the family) when you're upset (I never gotten to this point, but ok), makes you think that today might be the last time that you see someone that you love, so those last word are truly important, they will be stuck in your head for the last of your life, and there is nothing that you can do about it.<br/><br/>When Willoughby kills himself was also a shocking moment, I didn't see it coming. But, made sense, and also makes you think about this man life, like, how sad was that? What would have been worst? His daughters see he at the end weak and skinny, or they group up knowing that he kills himself? It's tough. And mainly, that is why I love the first half of the movie, it's perfect, powerful, surprising, amazing.<br/><br/>Well, and we arrive at the part when the thinks starts to get a little bit worst. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, awful or anything like that, it's just ""less good"", and there are some plot details that I was quite bothered about.
First, what a hell was that? How a guy throws another guy out of a WINDOW (ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF A BUILDING) IN FRONT OF THE CHIEF AND DOESN'T GET ARRESTED? What kind of city is that? Lol. Some other thing that I didn't bought was that people really make a ""movement"" around Mildred (defending the Chief), and one thing really made me confuse, the guy who goes bully Mildred at the store right before the Chief kills himself, was the same guy at the end? Like, wtf? He wasn't even from the Town, and still was friends of the Chief? I don't know, it might be, but is odd, isn't? It's a hell of a coincidence. I don't know if I like the end too, with a kind of ""force"" ambiguity, I don't think 
that Mildred would shy away from killing him.<br/><br/>Oh, another thing that I almost forgot. The ""zoo girlfriend"", come on, she is in a completely different movie, both scene that he show up. Yes, the movie has a sense of humor, but it's a whole different kind, the girl it's almost in a parody trash movie. <br/><br/>But the movie has a lot of other thing that I love, even through I think that makes no sense at all Dixon doesn't be arrested, I love the scene when they are in the hospital, and he realize what an asshole he was this whole time. Love the interrogation scene, the surprises of the script, and mainly the performances, this is really the great trump of the movie.<br/><br/>In short, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri it's a great film, that will probably win an Oscar or two (or even more). I have some issue with it, but in the big picture, I really liked.<br/><br/>Edit: I forgot, the soundtrack is awesome too. Really good."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a film that portrays something that unfortunately is happening nowadays, after the Hollywood scandals where it had many accusations against actors on sexual harassment, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri tells the story of a mother who is interpreted of impeccable way by Frances McDormand and that possibly will take the Oscar for best actress in the Oscar 2018 that decides to put three billboards on a road that is little used to get the attention of the case that was not solved of a brutal roar and murder of its daughter, is a film that has a great script, but I found the film slow, the direction of Martin McDonagh is good, but not impressive, the performances besides Frances McDormand that steals the film, we have Woody Harrelson making a character that is no longer in the his career, Sam Rockwell who is very well, Peter Dinklage, Lucas Hedges and etc, the way the story is conducted did not excite me at all Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a good movie, has many quality, Frances McDormang is impeccable and carries the film, but I expected more. Note 7.7"
"Songwriter_90210","8","2","3","9 January 2018"," Engrossing, Albeit Predictable at Times
","Three Billboards is rarely subtle, even though it gives that false sense that it may be. It is a film that feels both big and small at the same time, and as far as I'm concerned, that's an incredible achievement. <br/><br/>Francis McDormand is once again utilized brilliantly, this time as an angst-filled, impatient mother willing to bulldoze a system she believes is not working on behalf of her family. It would behoove anyone watching the first minutes of this film not to be brought into a false sense of calm and believe you're watching something of a slow burn. Things happen fast, and it has a kind of intensity that one might not expect of a film like this. <br/><br/>Sam Rockwell has always been a favorite of mine since Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and rarely disappoints in the roles he chooses. It's no different here. A complicated man one could easily write off as an idiot, the arc of his character is breathtaking and nuanced. Almost poetic.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson is, to me, always at his best. He's easy to watch because he's an effortless actor. He knows his craft well, and he's given us a solid performance this film. The rest of the cast turn in fine performances (special kudos to Caleb Landry Jones), and don't detract in any way from the film. Everyone is watchable. <br/><br/>The film is not perfect. There are times when I wondered why certain decisions were made, especially with the appearance of an ex relationship, a shocking end involving a character, an obvious insertion of a character to create more intrigue (however at the end one realizes it was totally unnecessary and not well thought out), and even a part where I nearly blurted out loud ""oh come on! He had to have heard that!"" Some of that was a little frustrating and seemed too contrived and unbelievable, but overall, this film it a good way to spend 115 minutes. It does not feel like a nearly two-hour movie. That's testament to its worth.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a very good effort, and it stays with you. Not forgettable, and fun discussing over a drink afterward. Do I believe it deserved the Golden Globe last night? Well, it won. It was up against some very good films, and held its own. I've seen all but one of the nominated films, and I think it deserved the win. I think Frances deserved the win. I think Sam deserved the win. I don't think it should have won best screenplay over another contender. But... that's just my opinion. <br/><br/>Such is life."

","As soon as Three Billboards outside Ebbing Missouri got the best picture and best actress Golden Globe I saw it.<br/><br/>I had heard of the story line of the movie - A girl is raped and there are no arrests, the mother takes it in her own hands to do something about it.
I was expecting a usual rape revenge drama. <br/><br/>But this gem is packed with much unexpected script delivered with unusual character developments and flow of events - ending in a climax that leaves us - what next?<br/><br/>Francis McDarmond is one of my favorite actress of Hollywood. Strong, deep into the character and rarely misses a note of acting. She is brilliant as an eccentric mother and a lone ranger fighter. Her pesona reflects so much anger and grit that one feels that nothing will ever stop her.<br/><br/>Within a town run by corrupt police to business as usual people, with eye-balling media awaiting a sensational news-story - this movie is packed with easy going overview of such events that unnerve and harass normal lives prevalent commonly in small towns all over the world.<br/><br/>The director Martin McDonagh had seen bill-boards of unsolved crime on one of his trips that gave him the story idea and casting of Francis was kept in mind while writing this fictional story and script of the movie.<br/><br/>There are small sub-plots in the movie with extremely well developed characters that are thrown at the audience unpredictably. Some you hate, some you love, and some of them makes you change your perspective from hate to like.<br/><br/>A string of small anecdotal comic stream is added to bring relief in otherwise swearing overtones of abuses spoken throughout the movie. <br/><br/>I would also point out that there are many obvious flaws and potholes in the narration, that can be overlooked. <br/><br/>Francis McDormand brings to life a quirky character filled with remorse, tragedy with grit to fight every road-block she faces. Brilliantly portrayed.<br/><br/>The background score of a few country tracks are very pleasing and ear-catching tunes.<br/><br/>This movie has already collected more than 50 awards and nominated for more than 150 worldwide. A sure hit at the Academy Oscars.<br/><br/>(I give this movie 7.25 out of 10)"

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: Written and Directed by Martin McDonagh<br/><br/>This movie had me at a bit of a crossroads. My initial reaction to it was one of pure hatred. I was angry at the ending. I was angry at what went down. What made me so angry? Could it be that I too was looking for answers where there were no answers to find? This is about a woman who rents out three billboards calling out the police department of her town after her daughter's murder case goes cold. You might think this is about finding out who this girl's killer was and bringing some closure to this family. This is not it. This woman's confrontational attitude brings out this side of people she's probably known her whole life. They feel the need to defend the police and fight right back against her. Mind you this is a woman who lost her daughter in a most horrific way trying to maintain some semblance of sanity while continuing to raise her son. Should they be angry at her about this? Her anger is justified. Her grief is important. The police chief understands this. <br/><br/>This is not what you might think this movie is at first glance. It is a swirl of emotions, both complex and raw. It took me some time to digest it after the fact to really get a good grip on it. The performances are superb. You love people and you hate them. You think you understand them but then the movie shows you just another side of them. They are complex, well rounded performances full of depth. <br/><br/>There is a point in the movie where things do go off the rail but I believe escalation is part of the theme running through the story's DNA. You might have suspend just a bit more disbelief.

","After 2-3 first scenes, I though the movie is simply a battle between 2 sides, the hopeless citizen versus the useless people of power. But it turned out to be so much more.<br/><br/>Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark drama on human's emotions and compassion. Through various bold plot points, it successfully tells the story and the entanglement of people's emotions as they seek to revenge, to exact justice, to win a divorce, to find love, to protect your loved ones, to demonstrate camaraderie, or simply just to do something good in life. Everyone has their own story, and most are not purely good or evil.<br/><br/>Through the characters' problems, the movie delivers the message of compassion. The characters make a lot of misdeeds, but the intention is not for us to judge, but to understand and sympathise with their unresolved frustration. We can all see ourselves in some part of the struggle, and the movie makes us wonder:""What would I do if it happened to me?""<br/><br/>Beside the strong plot, the message is achieved by excellent acting.

","It's a film much like the, often focused on, tied back undercut of Frances McDormand's hair; it very much presents two diametrically opposed things at once, one on top, one underneath and it lets us feel the way we want about them. Frances' Mildred may very well have been crazy before her daughter was killed, we don't know as we're mercifully and brilliantly dropped in months into her grieving process. People don't generally write slice of life films like this unless they're true stories, which intensifies the proof of skill writer/director Martin McDonagh has with writing nuanced, balanced, flawed characters. He manages, from his background writing plays, to not waste a single scene, there is not one moment in this film that doesn't bleed into another at some point and every moment gives weight to the next in the kind of suspense, surprise and momentum that other films just dream of having. The film uses its small microcosm of Ebbing, Missouri, and it's small incomplete story, to subvert film cliches effortlessly. There's a moment where Woody Harrelson coughs blood in the middle of a tough interrogation scene and the artificiality of his demeanour and that moment is just killed dead; his face shocked like a little boy's, his subject actually instantly taking pity on him. I've seen this in real life, I've never seen a moment like this in film, a construct built on artificiality, to use that construct to break it, just to show how human these human-like artifices are, is as close to magic as cinema gets.

I can see by the overall rating here in IMDb and on other websites that is has won over the majority of its viewers too. I guess I'm in the minority here as I can't really see why this film needed to be made in the first place.<br/><br/>Seven months after the brutal rape and murder of her daughter, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) decides to stir the pot after no headway is made in the case with the local authorities. So, she rents three billboards outside of her little Missouri town and posts three very disturbing statements which brings up the ire of the entire town - including that of her own son.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that is about the moment - not the end goal. It is about the journey more than the destination. Her reason for renting these three billboards in the first place is to find her daughter's killer. But, that is not the reason for the movie. The reason for the movie is the three billboards themselves and the consequences she and others have to face by putting them up. Along the way, the original end goal, destination or reason (that of finding her daughter's killer) is lost and all you are given to comprehend is the here and now.<br/><br/>The acting was absolutely superb, I will give it that. But by the end of the movie, I was sitting there shaking my head. Was this the only reason this movie was made? To show Frances McDormand's acting chops? This was reminiscent of another movie starring Nicole Kidman titled, ""Strangerland"". There is no absolution or resolution in that film either. If this rides well with you, then I think you'd enjoy this film. If you are in it for solving the mystery behind the reason of the movie - you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Not a recommend, unless you want to see some good acting.

"dizozza","6","1","1","16 August 2018"," It affirms the unreality of the cinema aesthetic
","I recommend reading my comments after seeing the movie, but if you never intend to see it, read them now: <br/><br/>The script gives its characters words we should not expect them to say, to express insights that should surprise us. The characters follow the path to cinematic fulfillment (the movie leads to a road trip). For all its appearance of social consciousness, Three Billboards is an entertainment. <br/><br/>The artful ways the movie delivers platitudes makes the platitudes seem fresh. The characters must be in darkness (since they're from Missouri?) before discovering that they can move into the light. They're supposedly racist and bigoted -- what does that have to do with finding or failing to find a rapist/murderer? <br/><br/>Now that I have asked, I offer an answer. The practice of racism and bigotry breaks down its practitioner's will to work overtime, and it reduces the incentive to explore the unknown. <br/><br/>Movie vengeance, however, is always worth the extra effort.
 
To demonstrate the degree to which one can work overtime, the fired police officer nearly kills himself to catch the monster criminal. <br/><br/>Ultimately, there could be a cover-up to protect the accused, who is a desert marine, in order to demonstrate the degree of bias the police can have in favor of veterans over civilians.<br/><br/>But the conjecture is for our own amusement. The piece is a construct, filled with incendiary randomness...cancer, suicide, torture, rape, murder, arson
(To quote memorable lines from Bob Dylan, ""Abe said, where do you want killing done? God said, Out there on Highway 61"" ... by the three billboards.). <br/><br/>These unexplained initial acts (How low can humans go?) are what make the movie possible.<br/><br/>As with Tarrantino movies (which get more entertaining the older they get) some human automaton out there must be willing to do a horrible act in order to test everyone's reactions.<br/><br/>In Mr. McDonagh's move (this one), the lines that resonate currently are spoken in the brick-a-brack shop ""Did you do it?""
Answer: ""No."" 
The unspoken further answer for the audience to add later is, ""but I've been doing the same thing in Iraq.""<br/><br/>Yes, I kept watching. Toward the half-way mark the surprises in cross narratives grabbed my attention and held me to the end. That in itself deserves my acknowledgment of efforts of all involved in creating this piece.<br/><br/>There is a Nicholas Roeg reference in this movie, which I see discussed elsewhere in the IMDB comments which I did not believe while watching. <br/><br/>In the movie, the movie on TV is ""Don't Look Now,"" Mr. Roeg's Venetian Lost Child Thriller. ""Don't Look Now"" is scary. It doesn't mount social consciousness issues to create self-satisfying entertainment. (I'm thinking the resurgence of socially conscious entertainment began with the 2004 ""Crash.""<br/><br/>I like that this movie ends with the two major stars on a road trip."

","Humans are creatures that create value. One person may find throwing trash on the ground in a public place intolerable but have little problem treating an employee or co-worker as a means to their own advancement. Another may find fatherhood or motherhood their highest calling investing most of their life energy to the task but give little thought to being cruel to a server at a restaurant or a pet dog. Sometimes our values in one area of our lives seem entirely incongruous with the values we hold in another area and the incongruity can strike others as downright bizarre. This value incongruity is a theme in other writer/director Martin McDonagh's films but is a central focus in Three Billboards. <br/><br/>The movie is about a distraught mother who works to ""focus the mind"" of what to her is a complacent police chief (played with vigor by Woody Harrelson) who has failed her. Mildred Hayes's (Frances McDormand) daughter has been raped and killed and after a year, no suspects have been arrested. In an act of desperation and anger, she pays to have two questions and a statement posted to three billboards near her home each implicating the Ebbing police department and it's chief of police in particular for inaction and perhaps incompetence. The billboards polarize the town and turn over rocks, as it were, causing all sorts of nefarious and violent things to crawl to the surface. McDonagh deals with themes of abuse, intolerance, bias, authority, revenge, and despair and while these certainly are present throughout the film, I never felt the film was really about these themes. Rather, these form the backdrop for a more dominant theme: the cognitive biases and dissonance we exhibit as humans that give our lives an incongruity about what we value and how we express those values.<br/><br/>Mildred clearly is a mother experiencing despair and tremendous anger about her loss. And rightly so. A victim of an abusive husband who she divorced, Mildred works as a clerk in a trinket store trying to raise two kids on a meager wage. These circumstances certainly would be grounds for bitterness and anger though don't really explain the degree to which Mildred seems to possess them. Then in a single flashback we see Mildred's harshness and anger present in a conversation she has with her son and daughter ostensibly on the day her daughter is killed. ""I hope I get raped on the way!"" her daughter Angela (Kathryn Newton) screams after Mildred refuses to let her take the only family vehicle forcing her to walk to an undisclosed location. ""I hope you get raped on the way too!"" Mildred screams back as Angela walks out the door. This is not something we imagine even an angry mother would say on her worst day. She's vindictive, angry, and immature and yet at the same time, tough, determined and passionate. This is a woman we both deeply admire and pity. We want her to win yet we agonize over her loneliness and rage.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, I asked an Irish friend of mine to give me feedback on this review. His comment after on the above paragraph is insightful. He said, ""Ireland is full of hard/harsh loving mothers. The mother is also the center of Irish society and we would all believe in the unlimited tenacity of these crazy, ragged characters."" This illustrated to me a deeper dichotomy in a character like Mildred than a simple caricature can and should portray and it's a helpful call out. The line between hard and tough or between obsessive and passionate can truly be thin and partly in the eye of the beholder.)<br/><br/>McDonagh then presents a woman who values finding her daughter's killer at any cost. There is a shadow cast over her determination and mental and physical toughness: she thinks very little of being cruel to almost everyone, causing emotional and psychological harm to her son, endangering lives, damaging property, and becoming truly isolated even from those who wish to help and love her all for this single goal. Few have experienced loss of the type Mildred has experienced and while we might imagine the rage we would feel, it's not possible to know it truly. Mildred's dissonance is extreme and perhaps for good reason. But we all possess this type of incongruity. The result is the good that may come from upholding the single value becomes offset by the abuse of all other values. <br/><br/>This is illustrated through the lives of principle characters in the film. Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell) gives very little thought to physically assaulting a citizen or verbally assaulting people of a different color (or size) in his duty to protect and serve the population of Ebbing. In a state of despair over the loss of a somewhat noble colleague, he says to himself ""I know that the best thing, the only thing, to honor that man's memory right now, is to go to work; is to be a good cop. To walk in his shoes and do what he did every day of his life. Help people."" He says this just before he walks out of the police department, proceeds across the street to beat up a completely innocent citizen and throw him out of a two-story window in a rage. In the scene that follows, he is shown bragging to other officers of his act as if he believes the act itself was an example of ""being a good cop;"" of ""helping people."" He has an extreme form of cognitive dissonance where the singular value of destroying those who he deems unworthy of his colleague's memory comes at the cost of actually protecting and serving those he vowed to protect and serve. The incongruity is at the same time humorous, shocking, and bizarre and we're made to feel it. <br/><br/>McDonagh, though born in England, is a child of blue-collar, Irish parents who left Ireland to look for work and gave birth to Martin shortly after the start of the recent 30-year clash that pitted the Nationalists against the Unionists. While McDonagh himself most likely would not have experienced the conflict in Ireland directly, he no doubt would have felt the effects of The Troubles through his parents and frequent visits to his home country. A dual citizen of Ireland and England, it seems his heart belongs to Ireland. Many of his plays are set in Ireland and it appears he even took an artistic stand related to the effects of the conflict (read more about this in his biography here). I raise this only because I suspect that McDonagh's focus in this movie may partially be influenced (consciously or unconsciously) by hostilities that occurred in his home country during his formative years. The ideas that fuel conflicts like these are supposedly focused on making life better for the people involved but, in the process, tear those same lives apart. The focus on achieving an end regardless of the cost runs the risk of destroying the people who would benefit from the outcome. This is incongruous-as incongruous as the behavior of the principle characters in Three Billboards. (Of course, McDonagh wouldn't have to return to his Irish roots to easily find such incongruity. The country in which he now lives and works exhibit similar pathologies.)<br/><br/>A scene in the movie might lend credence to my suspicions. Mildred returns home one day to find a Catholic priest sitting at her kitchen table talking to her son. The priest tries to tell Mildred that while the town is with her in her desire to find her daughter's killer, they are against her posting the billboards. Mildred's response is indicative of this meta-narrative I'm claiming exists in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect. Some things happen too quickly. Dixon is beyond doubt a cruel and bigoted man. These are not surface qualities but deep-seated, ingrained character flaws. Towards the end of the film he appears to become virtuous in an instant based on a single word from the chief. Granted, Dixon is portrayed as simple but even (especially?) in the simple, character flaws take time to undo and Dixon's transformation doesn't fit the general narrative the film is trying to get us to believe. Typical of modern films, there are no true heroes. But Three Billboards goes further. Ebbing Missouri is depicted as a town full of complacency and inaction. Severe violence happens in the open street at mid-day and no one steps in to help or even seems to care. This is a bit much even for those steeped in cynicism about red states. <br/><br/>Despite these minor flaws, the film is well made. It grinds some axes but not to the point of excess. This is a film that takes no sides and so ends up being a mirror into which we all can look and find ourselves even among the excess (I'm reminded here of Flannery O'Connor's phrase, ""To the deaf you shout, and to the almost blind you draw large, startling figures.""). It has the texture of Cohen brother's film--particularly No Country for Old Men and while it may not have quite the technical excellence in terms of pacing and direction, it's close enough to warrant the accolades its received.<br/><br/>A couple of people have asked me about the ending. I'm not quite sure what to say. It seems to run tangential to the rest of the film. We seem to be looking at a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" moment but then Mildred raises an ethical question that casts doubt that this is what we're actually witnessing. Perhaps this is McDonagh's final play at incongruity. Or maybe it's a lot simpler than that. Maybe it's just a sign of hope that things can be better if we just stop, think, and talk. Yes, let's go with that."
"davideo-2","9","1","1","11 June 2018"," Martin McDonagh strikes another hit with this quirky, off-beat drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In the small, mid-western town of Ebbing, Missouri, the daughter of Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) has been raped and murdered, and months have passed without any suspect being caught. In an act of desperation, she hires three large billboards leading into the town to put up some messages to embarrass the town's cancer stricken chief of police Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) into action. However, Mildred's actions come to have a far higher effect on more people than merely Willoughby, not least the volatile Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), and a host of others who prove less than sympathetic to her plight...<br/><br/>Ten years on, and Martin McDonagh's Belgian set comedy thriller In Bruges still remains one of the most memorable films of the last decade or so, with its witty, sharp dialogue and excruciating political incorrectness. And yet since then, this film proves only the second directorial feature he's made, a steady drip stream of work that even Quentin Tarantino would struggle to topple. His name is far less likely to seep into the cultural consciousness as that man's did, but when he pens a quality script, he hits a zinger, as this very impressive piece of work is further prove of.<br/><br/>McDonagh has selected a seasoned cast list of mature performers that are unlikely to appeal to the general target demographic of cinema goers, but will certainly whet the beaks of the more mature film-goers, and each one of them, including McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell, is perfectly suited to their role and deliver fine performances. It's McDonagh's distinctive style that drives the film, though, able as he is to take such a dark, tragic plotline and give it such a darkly humorous edge, whilst never losing the emotionally charged dramatic under-current that keeps it all flowing.<br/><br/>He's certainly quite a shy, occasional director, but if McDonagh can consistently produce this kind of quality work, it's a shame that he doesn't pop his head out more often. ****"

","Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri directed by Martin McDonagh follows Mildred (Played by the illustrious Frances McDormand) as she challenges local authorities to get to the bottom of the case of her daughter's murder.<br/><br/>I'll do a bit of a Public Service announcement here; This is a comedy. Do not do what I did and go in expecting a gritty crime drama. Why I expected this I'm not really sure, I've seen at least one of the directors previous work Seven Psychopaths (2012) and In Bruges (2008). I'm prefacing the review with this because I was a little thrown off during the course of this movie, caught by surprise by the dark comedy and not always for the best.<br/><br/>A couple of scenes in the film were and still are cringe-worthy with dialogue that belongs more in an adult movie. It made me laugh but I was not laughing with it, aside from a few scenes here and there the comedy is actually excellent and that's how I'd recommend this movie to you - as an excellent comedy. The crime drama aspect of it all is at the forefront but still takes a back seat, you could almost certainly enjoy the film by not giving a damn about the plot and just watching these characters interact. For me the main take away is the characters, they are wonderfully realised by McDonagh and the actors playing them. As usual, Frances McDormand knocks it out of the park being equal parts tragic and brashly hilarious.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell also delivers a usual superb performance honing his typecast as a 'redneck' but he also has the best character arc for any character in this movie. The writing is deliberately human, displaying the ugly truths and characters with 'warts and all' - no glossy heroes with no pitfalls, these characters are as real as they look.<br/><br/>McDonagh does a brilliant job of directing these characters and the story he wants to tell, we as the audience know that the film is not about catching the bad guy and solving the case, it's about the people and ourselves. Which does bring a layered movie, although I said this was a comedy it certainly should not be dismissed as a good drama, there are some really touching moments, because it gets to this idea that people just are not just black or white, we're all grey.<br/><br/>Three Billboards is a pleasantly surprising film, the writing is of the highest calibre when it's doing it right but has its pitfalls in parts of the film leading to cringe scenes and disappointing plot points. However, it is still a superb character drama/comedy that is a tremendous laugh as well as touchingly real."

","I read about 20 of these reviews and no one pointed out that the movie is based on an actual event where A MAN put up 3 billboards. And no one pointed out that this movie is just another example of Hollywood portraying women as men. If half of what Hollywood has been giving us lately is true we need to start a Stop the Violence by Women Against Men organization. It started when Hollywood remade movies and put women in the previous male roles. Now they are putting women in violent roles that used to be, more believably, given to men. Violent women, Wonder Woman, Atomic Blond, the list goes on. Women should be embarrassed to see themselves portrayed the way McDormand portrays this character. Some women watch women being tough in movies and on television and think that they can be tough. Every night across America emergency rooms admit women who thought they could kick their husband/boyfriends butt only to realize... it's Hollywood BS."

","I'll say this: I very much enjoyed seeing """"Three Billboards"" and would recommend it to anyone that asks, but it's because of the talent involved onscreen. Everyone in the main cast is incredible and these players help keep the movie going when the story falters. McDormand, for her part, is a force of nature, and years' worth of this character's pain and unflagging determination reside on the actor's face; the smolder in her gaze does plenty of talking. It's why the first half of the movie is exhilarating. <br/><br/>Tonally, it's a bit off, with that excitement waning at around the halfway point (almost precisely with the death of a major character) as sorrow and brutality take over. Sadly, we never get that opening power back, and this feeds into a complicated ending. But one thing I really liked about this movie is that it does become about more than McDormand's grieving and turns into a small-town drama; and empathy comes from the most unexpected of characters. Despite any of these issues, it's highly worthwhile and I doubt I'll forget about this anytime soon.<br/><br/>7/10"

","My obsession with Frances McDormand quite frankly knows no bounds. I first saw her in ""Raising Arizona"" and followed her through Coen Brothers (and other) movies - mostly terrific and some not-quite-so-good. My obsession with Sam Rockwell is equally obsessive. He is quite possibly my favorite 'not famous' actor working today. I saw the trailer for ""Three Billboards..."" many, many months ago, saw both names and faces and thought ""this is a film I MUST see."" But living in an area surrounded by 'Giving You Only the Latest Block-Buster"" Cineplexes, it came and went in literally one week and I never got the chance. After having seen McDormand AND Rockwell win Oscars for their roles last night I bought the DVD today, thinking ""I WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE."" But I can't say I did. The performances I did love - especially McDormand's. It ranged from explosive rage to intense sorrow, darkly funny sarcasm to obsessive neurosis, self-destructive insecurity to absolutely crippling guilt, tender, matronly moments to ""you gonna F with me??"" bravado . No spoilers, but she absolutely EARNED that Oscar last night. Rockwell did too. My only problem with the film as a whole is the writing. The story itself was gripping, moving, and (again, at times) darkly funny. Having said that, plot holes abound. Watch it, and you'll see what I mean. Also is my issue with the ""terrible characters ultimately very quickly reformed and redeemed without consequence."" IT'S A WORK OF FICTION, I keep telling myself. But the incredibly serious subject matter of the film doesn't really lend itself to that sort of suspension of disbelief one would take into, say, a Science Fiction movie or the latest Marvel blockbuster. In short, it's a good film featuring some incredible acting (a HUGE shout out to Woody Harrelson, showing range I've never seen from him in ANY movie) that has some serious yet, in hindsight, fixable plot holes and ""whaaaat?"" moments. Then again, it's ""just a movie."" But don't let my opinion sway you from watching it on cable. If you're a fan of any of these actors you will, if nothing else, be drawn into their performances."

What I really liked about this film is you never quite knew where this was going. It clearly steers you in various directions.

Indeed, it is a ""dark comedy"" - at least for the first half of the movie -- but at some point one must look inside and ask, ""Should I still be laughing??""<br/><br/>The performances are superb. Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell are brilliant, as are many in supporting roles: Abbie Cornish, Peter Dinklage, Woody Harrelson, John Hawkes, Sandy Martin and Clarke Peters. Every single player is real and believable.<br/><br/>Three Billboards is nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture and best screenplay. But it's a travesty that Martin McDonagh was not nominated for best director. The film should have contended for an Oscar sweep. <br/><br/>I believe the last time I wanted to rush back to see a movie the next day was the first time I saw A Clockwork Orange in 1978. And Three Billboards is the best movie I have seen at least since American Beauty. <br/><br/>If you don't believe me, then take a look around the theater as the movie ends and audience members are watching the credits.

","If you long for the brilliant depiction of the melancholy unity between humor and pathos, you'll love writer/director Martin McDonagh's darkly comic Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. In seeming homage to the Coen Brothers, especially their iconic Fargo and Raising Arizona, this film takes the rape/murder of Mildred Hayes's (Frances McDormand) daughter and weaves the dreary investigation with some scarily funny takes on small-town rednecks/crackers.<br/><br/>Mildred spurs the investigation of her daughter's murder by placing three billboards that accuse the local police, especially Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), of slacking. However, this is just the MacGuffin that pales in the shadow of the town's bigotry and lassitude. The Chief, however, is not necessarily culpable as he claims to have tried but without physical proof such as DNA.<br/><br/>Mildred, in Marge Gunderson mode, pursues the killer at the expense of local sympathy: ""It seems to me the police department is too busy torturing black folk to solve actual crimes."" Note the slams at languorous cops and racism, motifs played throughout.<br/><br/>Catching the right dark tones between grief and hilarious ineptitude, this film knows justice is not easy and sometimes meted out by imbeciles. Yet, getting on with a goal and learning cooperation and compromise, especially in a small town, may lead to a comfort that goes beyond catching a murderer.<br/><br/>The acting is incomparable. When Harrelson talks about the culture of racism, there's truth in his voice, sadness in his tone: ""If you got rid of all the cops with vaguely racist leanings, you'd have only have three cops left. And all of them would hate fags."""

","Seen trailers for this film a couple of times & knew I had to see it. Not because of the fake rave reviews this film has been receiving, but because it got my attention & as I do, I go & watch the film with with an open mind & see if it's any good. <br/><br/>Well sadly, that wasn't the case with this film. I mean there was some funny moments in it & some good points, but the film just seemed to go nowhere. In other words, it just seemed to string you on throughout the film with plot points here & there & just when you thought it was actually getting to the heart of what the film's climax was about, it ends...! That's it! A typical cliff hanger! So lazy, & so unimaginative! <br/><br/>The film is about woman named Mildred living in Ebbing, Missouri. We find out just 5 minutes in, that her daughter was raped & burned to death a few years back, but the case to find the person who done it went cold. So Mildred who is driving home one day spies the billboards en route, & decides to put them to her own personal use by putting up a message directed at the sheriffs department to prompt them to re-open the case & find the person responsible.<br/><br/>The films concept is unique & different. You already know the story about 20 minutes in but there was certain parts which made you think the film wasn't going to be as straight forward as it let on to be. <br/><br/>The sheriff having cancer was just an instant turn off for me. You thought the film was going to get good the second he knew about the billboards, but then he has cancer & dies prematurely in the film. Similar to how Jigsaw was killed off early in the Saw franchise, he was killed off in Saw III but more films followed, but that's another rant. <br/><br/>Anyway, there didn't seem to much of a war between him & Mildred. Which I would've liked considering it would've at least stuck to the story more & probably would've had a decent enough ending. But the films story derailed & spiraled around erratically from plot point to plot point, while being laced with scene to scene of this moody old hag 99% of the film! Some scenes seemed to stray away from the deal with the billboards, the film itself got lost in the middle, & when it finally did get back on track, it ended! <br/><br/>I even felt the film dragged & the scenes of Mildred acting out like a bratty 16 year old slag, didn't help! I mean the scenes in question weren't all bad, but the pacing & the quantity of them felt both distracting & out of place! Even when the film did get to the good parts, they themselves dragged & then the ending which, I had a feeling was going to leave a cliffhanger ending &... Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding!! Cliffhanger it was!!<br/><br/>Some scenes were pretty funny & there was some good stuff going on. Although the scenes you see where utterly implausible to real life & how certain situations happen, they still were nonetheless, entertaining. But began to get a little old as the film wore on. <br/><br/>I also have to say, the film felt unbalanced & all over the place. It dragged on & felt stretched out, unlike getting to the point of what the title was. The film lost it's way & forgot what it was supposed to be. Idiots moaned at the exact things I'm pointing out here in this film about Suburbicon, which got negative reviews, but that film was simple & entertaining. <br/><br/>Which brings me to another issue, the title. It's too damn long & difficult to remember to say when buying a ticket at the cinema. It would've been better to title the film Three Billboards! Shot & sweet & simple. Unlike this film which is long than the actual title, which is left to be desired considering the film doesn't sum up the point of the film, let alone the title itself. The point & title of the film quickly diminishes in the first 5 minutes. <br/><br/>Long story short, the film starts great, derails, strings you along, get back on track, then ends on a cliffhanger. Incredible. <br/><br/>Overall a poor disappointing film that had potential, had a unique concept, but was unfinished, dragged out, & ironically enough proves that once again that money talks & bullsh!t walks the critical acclaim coming from over paid film critics who'll easily give this tripe a critical acclaim of 10/10 rating for the sake of billions of £££. The fact that nearly over 30 film festivals have screen this film is shocking. This film could've been so much better had it got to the point instead of derailing & re-tracking again for the space of nearly an hour. <br/><br/>Rating: 2/10"

","Grief is an odd feeling to capture in writing, painting, or even in movies. Often times the sad part of grief is so emphasized upon that we forget about the anger, the anxiety and the unease that it carries. Perhaps because anger is associated with ugliness and rage, our heroes don't stay angry for long. They quickly get inspired and fight back to reach the happy ending where skies are once again blue, and grass is green. But anger is as relatable a feeling as hope or love, it clouds our judgments and pushes to limits we cannot imagine. I love Martin McDonough's work so much because ha challenges himself to use all that raw feeling to make art. There are no good or bad characters is Ebbing, they all try to cope with their life in their own ways and it's from depth of these characters (and not boundaries of movie genres) that we get sorrow, empathy and of course loads of dark comedy. The less you know about this feature going in, the better. The movie opens with Francis McDormand driving down a lonely road as the camera follows her from outside of the car. We see her looking up at something in front of her as she slows down, and when the car stops, we see the reflection of an old billboard in the windshield. We see the moment of her decision making all in one simple clever image. No cuts back and forth to clue us as to what she's looking at and of no lazy exposition. She decides to use the billboards to send a message to the chief of police in Missouri, asking what happened to her daughter's murdered. There is a book about how You can write a screenplay that you can successfully sell to Hollywood called ""Save the cat"" which outlines plot points and where the should happen, to generate a certain amount of forced empathy out of you for the characters in the film. You've seen the result in every Marvel movie, every blockbuster and more recently in ""Justice League"" and as fan, I find them to be more and more boring every time. Studios dare not to take risks, and continue to pander to our lowest common denominators as the audience so they can make a buck. My little rant on ""save the cat"" connects to ""Three Billboards"" because McDonough is aware of the audience expectations and he deliberately uses that advantage to surprise us and control our feelings. After all a director is only directing our attention during his film and not what we would like, and expect to see. This self-awareness is a double edged sword, as it can fire back for being too cheesy, to self-referential and too full of itself, but Three Billboards manages to walk the thin line perfectly, and you as the audience are lost in this movie's world because as you feel like you know these characters, and so you care! Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri has the best screenplay of the year, it has the best Female lead and best supporting male in Francis McDormand and Sam Rockwell, it is one of the darkest, and also one of the funniest films I've seen in years. Martin McDonough continues to build and own his tone as a dark comedic writer and my prediction is, very soon, just like the Quentin Tarantinos and Wes Andersons of this world he will be known for his own genre of film. Go watch this movie now! <br/><br/>https://mozframe.wordpress.com/"

Pitch black comedy/drama with McDormand (in an Oscar calibre turn) as an unapologetically strident, small-town woman seeking justice by buying advertising space to shame the local constable (Harrleson in a solid, low-key turn) for not solving the rape/murder of her daughter, fanning the fires for anger in the community and familial discord. Rockwell (also award worthy) is a hoot as a bigoted, imbecile cop on the force who is more than he appears and that could equally apply to the riotously profane and surprisingly poignant film by writer/director Martin McDonagh who shows in more ways than one that still waters run deep. One of the year's very best and highly original films."

","I had the pleasure of seeing the local premiere of Three Billboard outside of Ebbing, Missouri tonight at the Paramount Theater as part of Austin Film Festival. The film's style and humor is reminiscent of some of the better early Coen Brothers films (Blood Simple, Fargo, and Raising Arizona). The writer/director has basically stolen their style. Basically, a story that on paper is very dark and serious played with characters that are essentially humorous for dark comedic effect. The presence of Francis McDormand more-or- less completes the linkage. (She may well earn another Oscar nomination.) The film is deeply disturbing built around a mother's quest for justice after her daughter's violent death, themes of death and dying, police incompetence and brutality, and hints of racism and spousal abuse. At the same time, it can be hysterically funny and absurd. You want to laugh during one scene and cry during the next. The dis-functionality of just about every character is somehow both disturbing and hilarious. I think like the Coen Brothers, writer/director Martin McDonagh want you to take the issues raised seriously, but perhaps not to take ourselves too seriously. Overall, the acting and directing by a stellar cast is first-rate. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates this sort of dark comedy."

"classicsoncall","10","4","9","8 February 2018"," ""Looks like we got a war on our hands.""
","With a steely resolve similar to Winston Churchill's in ""Darkest Hour"", Frances McDormand knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of an aggrieved mother seeking justice for her murdered daughter in ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". Before seeing the movie and not knowing what the story was about, I thought the title of the movie was trying to be a bit pretentious and quirky to draw an audience, but all you have to do is see the movie and you'll know that any title would have sufficed for this engaging work from writer and director Martin McDonagh. <br/><br/>But it's not only McDormand you need to see here. Woody Harrelson plays somewhat against type as a local chief of police, and his deputy, portrayed by Sam Rockwell, provide a lot to contemplate about intolerance and personal agendas in out of the way, off the beaten path, American small towns. You'll find some of filmdom's most intelligent and creative writing in the letters written by Chief Willoughby (Harrelson) revealed after his death. I have to say, when Willoughby put that gun to his head, and even though you saw it coming, his suicide was the most electrifying moment I've seen on screen since Brad Pitt's character was blown away by George Clooney in ""Burn After Reading"". As the viewer, all you can do is sit up and reorient yourself because it suddenly becomes a different picture. Interestingly, Frances McDormand was in that movie too. <br/><br/>So I'm reading some of the other reviews here and it appears that there's some feeling that the movie leans toward dark comedy. I don't know if I can go along with that because the subject matter is entirely serious and most of the characters convey themselves with an appropriate earnest demeanor. One of the things that didn't work for me was Mildred's (McDormand) ex-husband (John Hawkes), carrying on with a teenage girlfriend, but I guess it could happen. Mildred's relationship with James (Peter Dinklage) might have gone off the rails in a different kind of movie but here, things were tastefully handled. I was also troubled by the revelation that the vicious redneck who beat up on Dixon (Rockwell) was exonerated on DNA evidence, a plot point borrowed from 2003's ""Memories of Murder"". <br/><br/>But even with some of my personal negatives, I thought this was a brilliant movie, brilliantly made. I think it has a fair chance of garnering a Best Picture Oscar along with a Best Actress for Frances McDormand, although this awards season is probably the strongest in recent memory regarding the competition. It will be interesting to see, but either way, it's a picture I'd recommend anyone to watch. It could very well leave you stunned."
"ThomasDrufke","9","4","9","1 December 2017"," The Most Unpredictable Film of the Year
","It's not that I like watching depressing films, but there's a strange appeal I have in watching films where people go through seriously tragic and heart-wrenching events. I think it's more of an appeal to go through emotions that you don't normally feel type of thing. And really, that's what movies are for in my opinion, to get a specific emotion out of the audience. Three Billboards was one of the most effective films of the year in that regard. I felt every emotion the film was trying to convey, and to the film's credit, that was a widespread range of emotions.<br/><br/>Classified as a dark comedy, Three Billboards is about a mother still grieving over her daughters rape and murder 7 months ago, so she decides to put up messages on billboards directed at the town's police department, and their lack of effort towards arresting the perpetrator. A powerful synopsis at that, but the film never takes itself too far in one particular direction in emotion. There are a few laugh out loud scenes but I was never taken out of the film with misplaced humor. There were plenty of dark themed sequences and discussions had throughout the film, but they were far from being emotionally manipulative. In that sense, this is easily one of the most well-balanced films of the year.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the cast for a second, because it almost sounds too good to be true. Frances McDorman plays the mother of a murdered child who is cynical and suppresses her emotions. Woody Harrelson plays a hardened cop who is well-respected around town. And Sam Rockwell is the lazy and vile cop who constantly doesn't live up to the expectations set by his peers. Those three alone are perfect casting, and that's not even mentioning the supporting cast. Director Martin McDonagh did a wonderful job of bringing Oscar caliber performances out of the three of them. <br/><br/>He also manages to direct the film in an unconventional and unpredictable way. Several times I was stunned by some of the decisions these characters made, but then after sitting down and thinking it through, it's exactly what those people would have done in those particular situations. When a film can surprise you while never letting that surprise be manipulative, that's the sign of a great director. If he's not nominated for best director, I will be very disappointed.<br/><br/>As I said up top, I want to be emotionally moved by every film I see. Whether that be laughing, crying, or on the edge my seat with overwhelming enjoyment, that's all I can really ask of a film. As Jim Valvano once said, there are three things you should do every day: laugh, think, and cry, and Three Billboards managed to put me through those three things several times in under 2 hours. That's one heck of a movie.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. When a film is so highly spoken about it can mean one of two things: 1) It's going to be a great film, or 2) the praise is being overstate. Unfortunately, ""Three Billboards..."" falls into the later category, as director/writer Martin McDonagh (""Seven Psychopaths"" 2012) presents an intriguing dark comedy that ultimately comes across as a variety of individual scenes put together to make a story. Featuring Frances McDormand (""Fargo""), Woody Harrelson (""The Hunger Games""), Sam Rockwell (""The Way Way Back""), Luca Hedges (""Manchester by the Sea""), Caleb Landrey (""Get Out""), Zeljko Ivanek (""Argo"") and Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones""), the acting is not the problem here. McDonagh's sets are stagy, his writing is lackluster, he tends to add in scenes/character in order to oddly move the story along, and the ending does nothing for the flow of the film. Standing out in this heavily star packed film is Caleb Landrey. Landrey is initially had to understand, due to an unexplainable accent, however, he over comes this weakness by graciously playing the victim. ""Three Billboards"" is far from a clunker. I guess I just expected a more tightly woven and satisfying production."
"gortx","Null","3","6","12 November 2017"," McDonagh's high wire act mostly works lead by McDormand
","Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE E.M. is one of the true high wire acts of the year. It's a dark farce that treads the line from serious drama to satire to some low rent buffoonery that might not make the cut on a mediocre sit-com. For the most part, it works, propelled by a profanely powerhouse performance by Frances McDormand.<br/><br/>McDormand plays a grieving mother (Mildred) who's daughter was killed in a particularly gruesome manner. Fed up with police inaction, she buys three billboards calling out the force. Add in choral music and stark locations and photography and the viewer thinks at the start that they may be in for some heavy going. And then Mildred opens her mouth - and, boy does she! Add in an idiot patrolman played by Sam Rockwell (Dixon), a goofy billboard salesman (Caleb Landry Jones), the local ""midget"" (Peter Dinklage) and other assorted colorful locals and that first impression is upended. <br/><br/>To his credit, McDonagh continues to defy one's expectations all the way to the delicious epilogue. Adding further support are a wry Woody Harrelson as the Sheriff, and Lucas Hedges and John Hawkes as McDormand's son and ex-husband, respectively. A sense of humor is maintained no matter how dire the situation and that will be a challenge for some viewers. McDonagh doesn't always succeed. Some of the actions and situations go too far even for satire. McDonagh, an Englishman, sometimes muffs the dialogue and characterizations. He knows his targets, but, sometimes his aim is off just enough to mark him as an outsider.<br/><br/>THREE BILLBOARDS is an angry comedy. But, one where that rage feels right for the times."

Like drilling her dentist's finger. And destroying the police station. And yet she isn't arrested. Why not? Similarly, Sam Rockwell's police character is clearly insane, committing all sorts of crimes, and yet he goes largely unpunished, because it suits the plot. The change in his character he undergoes later is completely unbelievable. He's been Mildred's evil nemesis, and now he's her friend? The ending is quite underwhelming.

","The talented cast and (occasional) idyllic images, not to mention Renee Fleming's beautiful rendition of ""Last Rose of Summer"" save this otherwise pointlessly violent movie. I know: the whole point is to mock violence, indulge violence, comment on our obsession with revenge but also comment on the need for justice. But a movie has to be willing to take a stance and risk sentimentality and risk being moral if it wants to be successful. Over-the-top violence is never funny to my sensibility, and I think it says more about our collective inability to solve our mass shooting problem and pervasive disconnect (preferring social media to real intimacy) than it does the movie's sophistication. When police chief Sam Rockwell knocks the kid off the roof and then goes down to the street to kick him into the hospital, camera's viewpoint where his gun would be holstered, it's disgusting, pointless, and not at all funny to this viewer. That they meet later in the hospital is supposed to function as some kind of double irony and edgy rapprochement, but it's simply exhausting. <br/><br/>I'm reminded of the popular movie ""Sideways"" of a decade or so ago--no likeable characters, no one I'd like to spend time with, no one I admire. And yet the popular consensus in that case was, as with this one, that the movie was so hilarious and so true on some level. Truth in ""Three Billboards"" would have been the Francis McDormand character getting out of the car instead of agreeing to travel with Sam to Idaho to act out their vengeance against the sociopath who, it turns out, didn't commit the rape of her daughter. Clearly, he's not a good guy, and the movie could have meditated on that more meaningfully, instead of turning him into yet another wrongfully accused but rightly unappealing character, righteous now that he has been brutally attacked for something he didn't do. <br/><br/>The only decent character is the new chief, the black officer come to replace Sam for his incompetence and inability to channel or heal his rage. The message here seems to be PC--all white people in the movie are rotten, horribly flawed, at the very least limited. The man in the white hat is black. That's a nice twist on an old cliché, but the social commentary is about as subtle as, well, renting three billboards to send a message to law enforcement to find a daughter's rapist/murderer. For God's sake (don't worry; I'm an atheist), don't be so afraid of a true character arc, one that offers the viewer a different lens, something better than: the white hoi polloi are all, as a class, backwater brutes. In the end, what else can an enraged mother (who was herself abusive) do? She can have a change of heart. Or she can find and confront her daughter's killer. But that's too prosaic for this too-cool-for-school best picture nominee."

","Filmed in North Carolina but taking place in Missouri (Missouri has mountains too), The Show Me State still ""shows off"" in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (my latest review). <br/><br/>""Billboards"" stings like a mother and is probably the most violent, in-your-face black comedy since 2000's Nurse Betty. In ""Betty"", Chris Rock rips the scalp off some schlepped car salesman. In ""Billboards"", Frances McDormand mutilates the finger of her dentist with his own drill. Restraint? Uh, I don't think so.<br/><br/>What ""Billboards"" has is shock value direction by Martin McDonagh, sharp, coarse writing, characters with nasty dispositions, and strong acting by everyone involved. What this film doesn't have is a true resolve, or a sense of relevance, or I guess, an actual ending. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a flick that sort of sits there. It's cinematically drunk on style, timed savagery, and derisive dialogue deliveries. I wanted to recommended it but alas, I just couldn't.<br/><br/>The storytelling in ""Billboards"" is one of the straightforward and unmissable variety. It's about the perturbed Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand). Mildred's daughter Angela, was raped and murdered seven months ago. Mad at the police for not following through with the investigation, Hayes rents three billboards outside her hometown (the fictional Ebbing, Missouri). These billboards signify her infused anger and frustration with said police. One of them reads, ""Raped while dying"". Another one reads, ""And still no arrests"". Mildred's uncouth behavior ticks off certain townspeople along with Ebbing's dying Sheriff (Bill Willoughby played by Woody Harrelson).<br/><br/>Anyway, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has scenes of arson and clips of subtle, racial insinuations. It also features a tracking shot in which a cop beats an ad agency worker and then throws him out of a window. Personas in ""Billboards"" threaten each other, blood flows freely, and every Mayberry- like transplant seems to collide through a set of almost implausible coincidences (Ebbing is a small place I guess).<br/><br/>As far as blackened satires go, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri makes you laugh one minute and then makes you squirm the next. It's startlingly entertaining but feels incomplete and irreproachably partial (even at a running time of 115 minutes). My rating: 2 and a half stars."

She has no responsibility to see other people as human beings with feelings. She doesn't have to take responsibility for her own actions because her daughter has been killed.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand gives a solid performance as the blunt, confrontational, mean-spirited Mildred Hayes.

It is here that we meet Mildred, the grieving. Who would not be sympathetic to a mother who's child had been kidnapped, raped, and murdered?

The film is a dark comedy-drama about a grieving divorced mother, who puts up three billboards (outside Ebbing, Missouri) shaming the police for not making any progress in her daughter's brutal rape and murder case. It stars Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell (who also starred in McDonagh's 2012 hit 'SEVEN PSYCHPATHS'), Woody Harrelson, Lucas Hedges, Caleb Landry Jones, Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish, John Hawkes and Samara Weaving.

It's expected to be nominated for multiple major Academy Awards too. I loved it.<br/><br/>Mildred Hayes (McDormand) is a single divorced mother, who's still grieving over the horrific rape and murder of her teenage daughter, seven months earlier. She is especially upset with the local police department for not making any progress in the case. So she puts up three billboards shaming them, especially Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Harrelson), who's dying from pancreatic cancer. Willoughby, and officer Jason Dixon (Rockwell), are extremely annoyed by her actions, as well as most of the rest of the town, and Mildred and her depressed teenage son, Robbie (Hedges), are harassed for it. Mildred still presses on though. <br/><br/>The movie is especially impressive in how it presents such a diverse range of fully developed characters, that are all extremely flawed and yet still very relatable (as both likable and seemingly very real people). It's an excellent tale of forgiveness, in my opinion, and learning how to accept and tolerate those you don't agree with. The climax and ending of the movie are also both priceless. It's so emotionally charged and totally unpredictable, that the film just really leaves you thinking about it, long after it's over. McDormand and Rockwell are also both outstanding in their roles, and McDonagh proves himself as one of Hollywood's top directors to watch for. The film is definitely a must see!<br/><br/>Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us"

","THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI: I have mixed feelings about this one. Mildred Hayes' (Frances McDormand) daughter was brutally murdered seven months ago with no suspect in custody, so she rents three abandoned billboards with a message directed at the town's sheriff for failing to solve the crime. Woody Harrelson has been doing some wonderful work lately and he can add Three Billboards to the 'Excellent' column. He shines as the sheriff giving an in depth performance and stealing the picture from McDormand who's performance is pretty limited and comes off as the poster child for looking stoic. There are a lot of shots of her looking stoic. A lot. Her emotions run the gambit from A to C. The town's police department is a few pieces short of a full set. The premise is interesting - up to a point, and starts to drag and feels pretty long for the story it's telling. It tries to be humorous in places, but it's mildly amusing at best. I found the ending to be somewhat less than satisfying. I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Score: 6. Don't go. Meh"
"admcdonough","10","4","11","28 November 2017"," Maybe the Best Film of the Year
","This is a terrific film with great performances. There are twists along the way and although the ending may leave some people unsatisfied, I thought it was perfect. The feel of the movie was certainly one of depression and frustration, but at the same time it managed to show hope for the human spirit. No matter how bad things are and how awful someone may appear to be, there is always the chance that there is some redeeming quality and this film brings that out. Frances McDormand is nothing short of amazing. There is absolutely no way she can't win an Academy Award for Best Actress for this role if there is any justice at all out there. It is a great performance, one of the best any actress has ever given and despite the Academy's recent penchant for giving awards strictly based on political correctness (or simply nominating Meryl Streep for whatever drivel she's been in that year), they can't ignore it and not give her the award. And Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell both deserve serious award consideration for their performances. They too are great as are the rest of the stellar cast. A film that makes you think, makes you laugh, and makes you appreciate what you have."
"ferguson-6","9","4","11","15 November 2017"," another McDonagh classic
","Greetings again from the darkness. Once out of our teen years (though some take a bit longer), the vast majority of us accept the obvious truth to the adage ""life is not fair"". Despite this, we never outgrow our desire for justice when we feel wronged. Uber- talented playwright/screenwriter/director Martin McDonagh delivers a superb drama blended with a type of dark comedy that allows us to deal with some pretty heavy, and often unpleasant small town happenings.<br/><br/>Oscar winner Frances McDormand plays Mildred, a grieving mother whose daughter was abducted and violently murdered. With the case having gone cold, Mildred is beyond frustrated and now desperate to prevent her daughter from being forgotten. To light the proverbial fire and motivate the local police department to show some urgency in solving her daughter's case, Mildred uses the titular billboards to make her point and target the Police Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). <br/><br/>The billboards cause quite the ruckus as the media brings extra attention, which in turn creates conflict between Mildred and the police department, the town citizens, and even her own son (Lucas Hedges). The film could have been titled 'The Wrath of Mildred' if not for so many other facets to the story and characters with their own layers. Her anger is certainly understandable, though some of her actions are impossible to defend. Things can never again be square in the life of a parent who has lost a child, yet vengeance is itself a lost cause.<br/><br/>Mr. McDonagh's exceptional script utilizes twisted comedy to deal with the full spectrum of dark human emotions: managing the deepest grief, anger, guilt, and need for revenge. As in his Oscar winning script for the contemporary classic IN BRUGES (2008), his dialogue plays as a strange type of poetry, delivering some of the most harsh and profane lines in melodic fashion. In addition to his nonpareil wordsmithing, Mr. McDonagh and casting director Sarah Finn have done a remarkable job at matching many talented performers with the characters – both large roles and small. <br/><br/>Following up her Emmy winning performance in ""Olive Kitteridge"", Ms. McDormand is yet again a force of nature on screen. She would likely have dominated the film if not for the effectively understated portrayal by Mr. Harrelson, and especially the best supporting performance of the year courtesy of Sam Rockwell. His Officer Dixon is a racist with out-of-control anger issues who still lives with his mom (a brilliant Sandy Martin, who was also the grandma in NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE). Caleb Landry Jones once again shows his uncanny ability to turn a minor role into a character we can't take our eyes off (you'll remember his screen debut as one of the bike riding boys near the end of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Here he plays Red, the owner of the billboards with an inner desire to carry some clout. Rounding out the absurdly deep cast are Zeljko Ivanek, Kerry Condon, Lucas Hedges (MANCHESTER BY THE SEA), Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Abbie Cornish, and Clarke Peters (the epitome of a new Sheriff in town). Every actor has at least one moment (and monologue) to shine, and one of the best scenes (of the year) involves Nick Searcy as a Priest getting schooled on ""culpability"" by Mildred.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Ben Davis has a nice blend of ""big"" movies (AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON) and small (TAMARA DREWE) in his career, and here he really captures the feel of the small town and interactions of the characters. Also adding to the film's excellence is the folksy, western score (with a touch of dueling gunfighters) by Carter Burwell. And keeping the streak alive  it's yet another worth-watching film featuring a Townes Van Zandt song.<br/><br/>Not many films dare tackle the list of topics and issues that are touched on here: church arrogance, police violence, racism, cancer, domestic violence, questioning the existence of God, parental grief with a desire for revenge, the weight of a guilty conscience, and the influence of parents in a rural setting. The film is superbly directed by Mr. McDonagh, who now has delivered two true classics in less than a decade. It's the uncomfortable laughs that make life in Ebbing tolerable, but it's the pain and emotions that stick with us long after the credits roll. Sometimes we need a reminder that fairness in the world should not be expected, and likely does not exist. If that's true, what do we do with our anger? McDonagh offers no easy answers, because there are none. But he does want us to carefully consider our responses."

","I think what I like best about this movie is the sheer unconventionality and originality that went into crafting the story. I can safely say I have never before seen a film about a billboard dispute in a small town. Really, this is a film about a small town where everyone knows everybody, and everything about their business; the subtle character development and relationships changes are more important than the events that happen. It's also the characters that give this town such a rich feeling. The public's perception of Mildred also becomes a character (just like how mob mentality becomes a character in Fritz Lang's ""M""); we get glimpses of how the town feels from her interactions with her friend Denise (Amanda Warren, ""Mother!""), with her son (Lucas Hedges, ""Ben is Back""), the town midget (Peter Dinklage, ""Living in Oblivion"") and even Willoughby's wife Anne (Abbie Cornish, ""Sucker Punch""). Building up this town with its diverse populous gives us a town that feels wholly unique, and while not all the characters are given enough room to grow, I would say probably 90% of the characters in this film show some sort of growth over the course of this film. That, in my opinion, is quite impressive; to establish an entire town and, without going completely off the rails, change every character in that town in some way."

"williampsamuel","10","2","4","20 March 2019"," A Masterpiece of the Blackest Comedy
","It isn't very often that you see a movie like Three Billboards Outside Ebbings, Missouri. Defying easy description, it treads a fine line between tragedy and the blackest of humor to tell a richly nuanced tale of mourning, vendettas, forgiveness, and small-town insanity.<br/><br/>Most of the insanity comes from hard bitten single mother Mildred Hayes, who rents out the titular billboards to demand why the police haven't solved the rape and murder of her teenage daughter months after it occurred. This doesn't sit well with the local PD, or with the many townspeople who adore the long serving, easygoing Chief Willoughby. The tensions this generates drives the story, along with many ill thought out hijinks.
Our humble protagonist is not the most likeable of people. She's cynical, foul mouthed, possessed of an acidic wit, and not particularly concerned what anyone thinks of her. She's also never been the kind of woman to let decency, common, sense, or the law stop her from doing anything, which she demonstrates repeatedly. Yet on some level this is what makes her relatable. She's may be a complete B, but not an unfeeling one. And she has a very good reason for her pain and anger.<br/><br/>When her anger fades and her dark wit fails her, we see that she is a woman deeply in mourning, with only the barest hope of closure. Particularly heartrending are the flashbacks to the bitter fights with her daughter, when she was still alive. It's amazing that she's able to carry on under the weight of such sorrow and guilt. She certainly hasn't chosen the healthiest outlets for her grief, but I suppose we all have our ways of coping. Frances McDormand's performance as Mildred is utterly brilliant, and I hope she takes all the awards she's been nominated for.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell is likewise a real firecracker as the drunken, brutally violent Officer Dixon, who is the closest thing this movie has to an antagonist. He is truly a sight to behold when he gets all riled up, his fists flying as he cusses up a storm. It's hard to believe that he hasn't ended up in his own jail long ago. But as with most people in this movie there may be more to him than first impressions would suggest.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson provides a sharp counterpoint to McDormand's acid wit and Rockwell's explosive violence as Chief Willoughby. Friendly and easy going even in tough times, his infectiously good-natured charm permeates the film long after his character has made his exit. His letters to Mildred and the other key players are filled with wisdom and humor, made funnier by the circumstances in which some of them are read. And oddly enough, they do more than anything else to drive personal growth and change in their recipients. It might even be enough to put Mildred on a slightly brighter path, though I wouldn't hold my breath.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that frequently makes you laugh, then makes you feel bad for laughing. It's a testament to the director and writer's brilliance that the movie can find humor in material this bleak. Or it might say something about their mental state. Three Billboards is also the kind of movie that constantly subverts your expectations. Every time you think you know where the plot is going it suddenly reverses on you. Characters develop in ways you never would have imagined. The best bits of humor- and the deepest bits of pathos- frequently come without warning. And the ending is a stroke of genius. It's nothing you'd expect, but it's the perfect one for this movie."

"MLDinTN","4","2","4","11 August 2018"," well acted but the story goes no where
","I don't get why this movie has gotten so much praise, yeah, it's OK, but slow with a very boring plot. Only the acting can keep your interest for nearly 2 hours. This was more like a hallmark TV movie. Basically, Mildred, decides to put up billboards criticizing the work done by the police in her daughter's murder. In a flash back, we see she carries a lot of guilt because of the last conversation she had with her daughter, but that part is never expanded upon. So of course, people in town get on her back, because the sheriff, Willoughby, is well liked and dying of cancer. She gets a lot of threats and her son gets picked on, but she won't take down the billboards. One side plot which I didn't get why it was thrown in, was Willoughby gives his family a special day, then kills himself. I don't get why that was thrown in. Also, Dixon, one of the ""bad"" officers but depicted with a heart of gold at the end, beats up the advertising guy, and doesn't go to jail. Instead, he nearly dies at the police station when Mildred sets it on fire. Only to team up with her at the end for vigilante justice. So out of character. So she just leaves her only child left to go hunt someone down; you'd think her son would be her number one priority. It was like just a mesh-pot of story lines thrown in to make a nearly 2 hour run time.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Just don't go in expecting some kind of murder mystery or action packed. Just regular people doing some dirty things to others because they think they have the right to revenge instead of dealing with their problems and grief."

There isn't a dull moment throughout, and the film seamlessly has you laughing one moment and crying the next without ever feeling contrived. It's an emotional roller coaster for sure, but it's absolutely worth the ride.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain why Three Billboards is such an amazing film, it has an incredible story to tell that's unique but touches on themes we can all understand and empathize with. It's also a very well made film; Martin McDonagh continues to improve with each of his entries, it's easy to make a film like this and not really try to hard to make it visually interesting and let the story do all the work, but there's enough style in Three Billboards for those who appreciate good filmmaking to understand the effort behind it, but it never gets distracting or goes over the top.<br/><br/>Three Billboards is a modern masterpiece, it's storytelling at its finest, I guarantee it'll have you in tears, and that you'll never forget it when you're finished.

"pipecax","10","2","4","19 April 2018"," A canonical class on character development, performances and direction.
","A game-changer. I have just witnessed one of the- narratively speaking -more intense feature films ever, one that, surprisingly, doesn't require Parisian landscapes or delicate photographs to be the most effortlessly acidic film offer in a very long time, one incorporating a really powerful drama and a delicious caustic black humor, putting you as a voyeur of the pain of others, a depraved buy purgative activity.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the greatest strengths of this towering work are in its script. The plot places us directly at the heart of the matter: three polygonal and outdated billboards that serve as a purifying instrument for characters and audience alike. A succinctly-shaped storyline of this kind must be reputed as a narrative milestone, for as a result of a tragic event, a mother drowned by grief and her voracious desire for justice will be the perfect machinery for executing finely-chained maneuvers, prioritizing a down-to-earth plot that will keep interest at its highest level. I'm still seriously disturbed by this fascinating, groundbreaking and invigorating screenplay; it's some time now since an American-British screenplay with a level of humanity and moral complexity as outstanding and superb as Martin McDonagh's latest opus is, who in addition to directing, is credited as the absolute artifice of this emotional purge. Thanks to this man, the world has been able to enjoy situations surpassing the epic drama, crowning moments, allowing each actor to show off their major talents, without falling into shameful exaggerations. The leading role of "" Fargo"" wonderful actress Frances McDormand, which will surely lead her name to global media focus, she expels strength, even when her heart is broken into hundreds of pieces. This impetuosity is precisely the agent allowing an almost instantaneous connection from the first scene on the road, that imperfection, remorse and feeling, seeking vindication in such emotional ways that announces the establishment of a new Ellen Ripley, for indie-drama genre, her brave nature, supported on the grief of a mother, stirs up a sensational feeling from which the film drinks on several times to achieve an unbeatable narrative cadence. The second great discovery is underestimated-actor Sam Rockwell. Rockwell returns with a worthy-recognition role, a really big one, Dixon, an alcoholic sheriff who doesn't frequent good manners, an arrogant policeman who doesn't care to pass over the world to be victorious. Needless to say, this actor executes one of the most powerful moments of the film at the hands of his character. Last, but not least, is a not-remotely-unusual player, as most of his performances get to touch the overwhelming, the really overwhelming. Willoughby is a police chief who failed to fully resolve a murder and rape crime, moreover, he's outweighed by repercussions that cause the three billboards of the protagonist and a life-or-death decision, here a controversial debate rises up, to confront a dreaded fatal fate. <br/><br/>A huge praise deserves some set-pieces pushing beyond the mettlesome narrative development. The film is rich in sequences that transmit by means of the pictures, and although it's almost impossible to avoid spoilers, it can be said that such strong points are distributed proportionately between the scenes where supporting and leading characters are involved in other words, between sequences that don't focus only on the bad-ass protagonist, even though, indirectly, all the moves lies on her. A mother, two local sheriffs, flames, explosions, love affairs, three billboards on deep-scarlet background and serious lettering, a surly dentist and a hired murderer are the ingredients used for the construction of a film which is based on its potent and articulated screenplay.<br/><br/>The score is brutal. From the start, I have considered musical accompaniments as key pieces for the success of transmission of emotions, of truth; A filmmaker must get to most possible resources to make sense of the specific and general purposes of the story, so I personally think that a simple melodic structure supports fabulous acting and creative task. Carter Burwell, who curiously had also worked with Mr. McDonagh in ""Seven Psychopaths"", has behind him gold scores of the stature of ""Carol"", ""Anomalisa"" and ""Mr. Holmes""; Now, he reappears with full hands through compositions that are rightly coupled with the most heartfelt moments of the film, His score for this story express, on many occasions, more than pictures, because from masterful and harmonic sounds he transmits grief, tribulation, intractability and madness accompanying the characters, while potentiates his chances to opt for the coveted golden man. We will have to keep a close eye on this New Yorker, as he insinuates being the next monster producing excellent soundtracks for deep films thanks to his undeniable talent.<br/><br/>""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" written and directed by Martin McDonagh will make history in my review Watchlist as the first motion picture in which I didn't evaluate technical or visually artistic aspects, which clearly are executed in a beautiful, crude and stunning way, however, I haven't considered them as a fundamental part because this film is purely story and characters. I was skeptical about a true audiovisual production mustn't be made up of visual, narrative and creative art, however, this work has shown me that art can be conceived by putting some components a greater importance than others, but finally, they are all there. A blistering catharsis led by top-notch performances and a glorified direction, this film is the most human, poignant, shocking and coherent drama I have seen in a long time, a major achievement for cinematographic narrative that reveals the potential emergence of a feasible writing maestro, while it serves as a magnet to unite a hugely talented group of people who make the film what it is."

Unnecessarily violent and are you trying to tell people it's ok to go mental and break laws just because someone unfortunate has happened in your family? And wait, how did racism get mixed into it? Don't even go there. Police officers too busy to bully black people so they didn't arrest the rapist? Yep stir that up in the society too when you actually don't have to. <br/><br/>The ending was non-sense, they are going to kill a rapist suspect?

"charbelelaro","5","2","4","4 April 2018"," brilliant performances, but unfortunately mechanical characters
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri is directed by Martin McDonagh and is nominated for a shocking 7 Academy Awards. Let's start with the positives. The lead actress is beyond oscar worthy. Woody Harrelson has a strong performance. Lucas Hedges was great also. This made it a pretty entertaining film overall. <br/><br/>Now for the negatives. People see strong political ideology surrounding current social controversy in a film and immediately need to praise the life out of it. To me I don't consider this a film. It's merely social commentary with great performances. Although I'm going to put that aside and attempt to focus on the film making. Looking at the screenplay and aspects of the story, I found countless issues. There are plot holes, ridiculous character arcs, and minimal growth from our lead character. To prove as to how, I will need to describe the plot, so spoilers ahead. There is a scene where a drunk cop beats a guy, and literally throws him out the window. The cop is then fired, and then just sits at home all day afterwards. Why wasn't he arrested? He beat him up in front of a crowd of people. Anyways this same cop returns to the police station after hours one night. However he's unaware that somebody is throwing glass bottles, setting the police station on fire because he's listening to opera music with head phones in. WHAT! Can someone please buy me these head phones, that can literally block out the sound of fire blazing explosions. This cop then goes to hospital due to his burns, and happens to be next to the guy he threw out the window. They then reconcile with the window guy pouring him a cup of orange juice. I'm sorry but I'm either insensitive or that guy should become a saint. But on top of all these unrealistic plot choices, there's constant attempts of some sort of humour. It actually kills me inside. The humour is honestly like what you would get out of a really bad kids animation, but put in a movie about murder. For example, the scene where the cop gets fired he's asked to hand in his badge. This scene is built up quite seriously, although then like some hilarious punchline the cop is like, ""oh I can't find it"", and spends 5 minutes emptying out all his pockets with awkward silence. Oh but what was even worse was the ex husband's 19 year old girlfriend. She just tanks every scene she interrupts. I'm confused as to why this won best screenplay at Golden Globes. Okay some of the dialogue is great, but there are so many careless issues in the story. The tone in this film is messy and inconsistent, resulting in a movie experience with character's I didn't care about. <br/><br/>The in-cohesive story writing is buried beneath great performances and a whole lot of social commentary. That is why people love the film. Critics are neglecting the importance of film making. It's a shame that this will probably win best picture. Movies like Dunkirk don't stand a chance, even though the film making is some of the best ever. But because it doesn't make any bold political statements relating to current controversial issues, it won't get the major awards. Three Billboards lacks emotional weight due to how disconnected it is from relatable human nature. Films like Good Will Hunting are incredible because of how they realistically zone in on the individual. Three Billboards forgets to take its time on smaller moments of pain and heartbreak, which humanise the characters. Making us feel emotionally attached to them. Movies like Good Will Hunting, which do that end up saying a whole lot more about humanity. This movie was a colossal disappointment. The character arc for the racist, drunk cop is so weak. He gains such easy redemption for all his wrong doings, without repairing any of his damage. For a movie with a strong message surrounding female empowerment and civil rights, it ends up showing sympathy towards a racist white supremacist cop as well as contributes to religious intolerance. If you want to see the ramifications of holding onto hate, watch American History X. The entire message of that film is that hate is hopeless baggage. Three Billboards attempts to show this with brilliant performances, but unfortunately mechanical characters. So therefore I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri a 5. It's so important to see characters authentically grow in film, otherwise it feels like nothing moves forward. And if that was the whole point of this movie, what's its purpose?"

First of all, it is not a murder mystery, but a commentary on your (I am not american) society.

Pollice brutality is timeless and all over the place, so is misuse of power and authority, so is racism be it racial or social, or putting the blame on the victim, or how the media exploit a situation for ratings and almost always they go unpunished... so please take those out of the way this ""case""'. They are the norm. And on top of that you get a little glimpse of the ""work"" of some of US troops who fight and defend democracy, freedom and the ""american ways"" all over the world....<br/><br/>If you want to concerne your mind with stuff like that, watch ""Mississippi Burning"" as it is based on true events. Frances is in both movies and is equally brilliant.<br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is what you see when you look at yourself in the mirror dear americans.

I decided to stick with it for a bit longer, and it turned out to be a worthwhile decision. <br/><br/>This movie takes you on a trip. The story is not about the three billboards or the death of Mildred's daughter. It's a story that's a mini life story about each of its key characters, Willoughby, Dixon, James the dwarf, and even the supporting characters. The tone makes me think of Breaking Bad or Boardwalk Empire. The big story is just a frame to insert the personal stories into. It's like binge watching a Netflix series all in one movie. By the end, you feel like you've come to know and understand the people, who in the beginning of the movie seemed like strange, mean, hateful people.<br/><br/>It's a great movie because, like most great movies, it breaks with expectations and takes you somewhere other than where you thought it would go."

","My favorite film of 2008 was ""In Bruges"", the directing debut of Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, and now McDonagh furthers his art with his third film, ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"", a sort of dark comic crime film that is really a complex character study of a disgruntled mother upset at a town's failure to solve the murder of her teenage daughter to the point she rents three billboards outside the town to call attention to the unsolved murder. Frances McDormand plays the grieving divorced mother, Mildred Hayes, in a performance that might even surpass her Oscar-winning role in the Coen Brothers' 1996 ""Fargo"". She's cynical, angry at the core, street-smart while flawed, and her inner journey is rightly the film's main focus. But she isn't the only character sketch that fascinates in this film. Two other characters display important moral arcs: the town sheriff Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson, surprisingly the most likeable) and, most significantly, Officer Dixon (a career best performance by Sam Rockwell that seems the film's most memorable). <br/><br/>The movie's brilliant wit and marvelous interactive dialogue is matched by McDonagh's handling of the actors and control of the visual style, while keeping the humanity of the characters at the forefront as he deftly manages to circumvent the clichÃ©s always found in these kind of movies. Highly recommended as a remarkably composed portrait of small town America, it sends viewers out of the theater to contemplate moral questions concerning justice, revenge, anger and forgiveness. It is one of the year's most entertaining movies."

Finally, now we have Mr McDonagh place that advertising vehicle on the front and centre, showing both its potency and frailty.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand's performance as Mildred Hayes, a grieving mother of a rape-murder victim whose case has hit the doldrums, encapsulates what McDonagh wishes to express in his commentary and nails it right from the start where we see the mother's exasperation after having pulled over the side of the road and her contemplation upon seeing the unused, dilapidated billboard which leads her to the light-bulb moment that steamrolled over a sleepy town in Southern USA. McDormand's exceptional understated performance is well complemented by a tight ensemble of performers (Harrelson, Rockwell, Hedges, Hawkes, Landry Jones, Cornish, Britt-Gibson, Ivanek, Dinklage, Peters, Weaving, Martin, Warren, Newton, Condon, and others) that provides a tapestry of unforgettable characters that wraps up a perfectly executed film.<br/><br/>My rating: A-flat."

","It's the story of a griveing mother desperate to get closure on the rape and murder of her teenage daughter.

In this dark comedy she is what all of us wish we could be so often. Ruthless <br/><br/>Woody Harrelson playing Chief Willoughby, shows the equally soul-destroying aftermath that a case of this nature leaves for not only the family, but the those charged with picking up the pieces. Desperately trying to make progress on a case that left nothing but hurt and misguided blame. His execution of this role brings this movie to an equilibrium of sadness, hope and peace. <br/><br/>While Harrelson and McDormand show their experience on the set and their performances compliment each others' entirely, the stand out for here is Sam Rockwell. He plays a new cop on the force who is almost everything all at once. Terribly ignorant and corrupt but true and loyal to the end. His character is so off kilter it's spot on. <br/><br/>Director Martin McDonagh stays true to his theatrical form delivering clean crisp scenes where actors are left to tell a brilliant story.

"ModishMovies","7","2","4","21 February 2018"," The Best of the Year? Not Quite.
","Engaging, interesting, deep, but poorly-paced. Those are the best words that come to mind after I finished re-watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.<br/><br/>This was my first Martin McDonagh film and it encouraged me to check out his two, much better, previous films -- Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges. If you enjoyed the unpredictable storytelling of any one of his films, but have not watched them all, you will also enjoy his unpredictable, unique narrative structure of his other films, which particularly shines in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. His characters are all well-developed, although some are more interesting and watchable than others. Three Billboards is no exception. The story is very smart and serious, even though the screenplay is as hilarious as the subject matter is dark. <br/><br/>Frances McDormand plays Mildred Hayes, a woman grieving after the rape and murder of her daughter. After months of the local police doing nothing for her case, she takes justice into her own hands, first in the form of three billboards calling out the police chief, Woody Harrelson's Chief Willoughby. As the story unravels and the tension builds, the message becomes more and more clear, until it is finally spoken in simple, obvious terms that ruins the subtlety and intelligence of the screenplay. However, the characters are still deep, emotional, and well-developed throughout even when the screenplay falters.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the development and arc of Sam Rockwell's racist police officer, Dixon. At first, he is given the simple, one-dimensional characterization that causes viewers to dismiss him as the villain, or at least an obstacle in the way of the protagonist. Over halfway through, a realization dawns on viewers that sets the stage for the wonderful message: Maybe the hero seeking justice is just as bad as the racist cop. The theme of anger begetting anger is brilliantly told through the characters and their actions in the story. <br/><br/>The setting is also just as important in this movie as many of the characters are. By naming the town fictionally, it is easier to understand how these characters with unrealistic traits and qualities would interact and live in a town like this. Although the characters seem unrealistic, their emotions are certainly real and relatable. McDonagh has a preference for naming his films literally and directly from what the story is about. Ebbing, Missouri is a place of receding hope and grief. In other words, the love, hope, and optimism in Ebbing, Missouri ebbs away as the film progresses and the characters act more and more. <br/><br/>The largest flaw I have with this film is the pacing of the third act. The first two acts were exceptionally well-made/paced and evoke strong reactions from the audience. Once the majority of the story has been told and the events laid out for us, the film comes screeching to halt, but doesn't end. After the climactic sequence, the story slowly (slower than you can imagine) crawls to its conclusion. As a result, the conclusion leaves viewers thinking, ""Finally!"" where it could have left us thinking that it was shorter than it actually is. To quote Roger Ebert in his A Clockwork Orange review, ""You know there's something wrong with a movie when the last third feels like the last half,"" and those words have never applied to a film more than Three Billboards. <br/><br/>While I still encourage you all to see this (in theaters if possible), it's also important that you know your tastes. If you prefer dark comedy and a subtle, smart story, this is definitely for you. If you hate comedy mixed with serious subject matters and prefer faster-paced films, maybe seek out Dunkirk or Wonder Woman. I happen to be a part of the former and enjoyed this film's mix of dark comedy and somber atmosphere. I also feel that I must admit this: After the Golden Globe awards, I felt highly unsatisfied that Three Billboards won in many major categories and that likely led to me thinking this film is slightly worse than it actually is. While it deserves many of the awards that it has gotten (and is likely to receive), The Shape of Water will always be my favorite of the year, no matter how unpredictable, refreshing, and memorable Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is.<br/><br/>4/5 stars."
"tomgillespie2002","9","2","4","20 February 2018"," Is somehow both enormous fun and utterly heart-wrenching
","Along an overgrown, disused highway somewhere outside Ebbing, Missouri, three formerly dilapidated billboards still bearing the torn remains of whatever advertisement was previously displayed there over a decade ago, have suddenly sprang back into life. Only the messages delivered aren't in the name of some big-name brand or local company, but they are the deliberately confrontational words of grieving, thoroughly pissed-off mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand). The first billboard reads 'Raped While Dying', followed by 'And Still No Arrests', and finally 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?' The opening scenes of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which see Mildred negotiate a deal with businessman Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) and quickly install the provocative messages, set up a David-versus-Goliath story, in which a justice-seeking woman sets out to shame and spring into action the police department she feels has failed her following the brutal rape and murder of her daughter.<br/><br/>Yet, this being a film written and directed by Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, the kind of story suggested in the trailer is only the tip of a far more engaging and complex iceberg, and one that isn't afraid to take you to some incredibly dark places and urge you to accept the redemption of a truly repulsive character. The police department, led by family man and all-round likeable pillar of the community Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), take the billboards as a declaration of war, but Willoughby, being a sensible officer of the law, pays a visit to Mildred for some one-on-one time in the hope of resolving the matter peacefully. They chat almost like old friends, or former lovers who have stayed on good terms, but Mildred is unmovable in her quest. Even the revelation that Willoughby has terminal cancer and is close to death isn't enough for Mildred to think twice about her actions, and it turns out that she was already privy to this information before renting the boards. ""They won't be as effective after you croak,"" she admits, almost like it's her way of apologising.<br/><br/>The role of Mildred was written specifically with McDormand in mind, and the result is her best performance since 1996's Fargo and will surely bring her second Oscar win come March. The first time we lay eyes on her she is marching into town like a gunslinger seeking revenge, dressed in blue overalls and sporting a tightly-wound bandanna. Despite the pleas of her teenage son Robbie (Lucas Hedges), who is bullied in school because of his mother's antics and performance on the local news station, as well as threats from the drunken, racist Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), Mildred is unwavering in her strides for justice. Even her deplorable, wife-beating ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes) voices his disapproval, but it all falls of deaf ears. Yet despite her questionable methods and finger-pointing at a police department who seem to have genuinely run into a dead end with the case, you stay with her until the end. I can't think of any other actress working today who could pull of a feat with such conviction, especially when dealing with a character who spends most of the movie keeping her real emotions close to her chest, or channelling them into rage.<br/><br/>McDonagh views small-town America as tightly-knit and full of big characters, a place where everybody knows everybody and gossip spreads like wildfire. In many ways, Three Billboards shares much in common with Calvary, the under-appreciated effort by the director's brother John Michael from 2014, and is structured almost like an ensemble piece. By bringing in a wealth of colourful supporting characters, played by the likes of Peter Dinklage, Abbie Cornish, Kerry Condon and Clarke Peters, as well as those already mentioned, McDonagh can explore themes of anger, bitterness, loss and loneliness on a far grander scale. While the wonderfully obscenity-laden script will keep you both laughing and wincing throughout the running-time, the film is at its most compelling when showing genuine compassion for the characters inhabiting the story. It refuses to judge anybody too harshly, even peeling back the layers of the most loathsome character in the story, the permanently hungover Dixon, who is played by a career-best Sam Rockwell. Three Billboards somehow manages to be both enormous fun and utterly heart-wrenching, and coming off the back of the underwhelming Seven Psychopaths, this is a huge stride in the right direction for the enormously talented McDonagh.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

"MarkoutTV","9","2","4","31 January 2018"," Skates on thin ice at times, but overall, fantastic
","Story time, kids.<br/><br/>Some weeks ago, when I went to a screening of The Room that included an appearance from Tommy Wiseau himself, I got to the theater very early, because it was Freaking Tommy Freaking Wi Freaking Seau and I wanted to make sure I was first in line to meet him.<br/><br/>However, when I got there, there was already a massive line. I figured it could only be for one thing, the aforementioned Freaking Tommy Freaking Wi Freaking Seau so I just got in the line. It wasn't for another 20 minutes of standing in this massive line that I realized it was for another film, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. <br/><br/>I was dumbfounded. Freaking Tommy Freaking Wi Freaking Seau was about to be in the building and meanwhile there was this massive line for a movie I never heard of. Needless to say it was on my radar since then. And I'm glad my memory didn't fail me for once because this is a heck of a film.<br/><br/>The wonderful thing about this film is that it's so not what you think it is from the description alone. One would assume this will be a standard story about a powerless individual going against the big bad police force. A clear story about the good guy versus the bad guy. <br/><br/>Instead, this movie has no good guys. This movie has no bad guys. This movie has people. People that all think they're doing the right thing; people with clear motivations and radical ideas on how to accomplish them, sometimes oblivious to the big picture ramifications. <br/><br/>Frances McDormand plays one of these people, Mildred. Having had a daughter who passed away in terrible fashion, she is singularly focused on having her local police force get off what she perceives to be their lazy asses and figure out who did the terrible deed.<br/><br/>Contrary to a more stereotypical movie dealing with this subject matter however, the cops aren't flat out evil here. There are cops that are genuinely trying to have the case solved, but simply can't due to a lack of leads. Frances' singular devotion to calling out the police in fact, has very human impact on good men that may not deserve the public humiliation she's offering. However as a woman that has lived through the hells of an abusive spouse and a slain child, she isn't seeing this side of the coin. <br/><br/>It was a breath of fresh air that in this current political climate where they easily could have reached for the low hanging fruit and portrayed the police as singularly abusive and cruel, they didn't do that. Everyone here is a human. A flawed human, because all humans are flawed. There are for sure police that act in an abusive manner, but there are citizens that commit atrocious acts of violence here too. Some of the cops are racist or homophobic, some aren't. And same with the non-police characters.<br/><br/>McDormand is magnificent here. She has an exterior as rough and solid as a cinder block. She is hyper focused, ballsy and doesn't accept anything less than what she wants. It's this attitude that moves the plot and supplies some decent comedy. It's also this attitude that makes her brief moments of vulnerability more unsettling. Her devotion to her ultimate goal of justice is admirable of course and the fierceness at which she fights for it is enjoyable, but the impact of her actions on those around her often gets lost to her. She never stops being sympathetic, but any notions of her being 100% in the right are dispelled before long.<br/><br/>Equally maginificent, perhaps even moreso is Woody Harrelson, who only took a few months to surpass his amazing turn in War For The Planet of The Apes to deliver another belter. His character, Willoughby, is a decent man. He's well spoken, polite, kind, cares about public service and loves his family. Unfortunately, he is also the chief of police and therefore the greatest single object of Mildred's venom. Watching him trying to do the best for everyone and stay positive while being torn apart not only from the public assassination of his character, but also from a significant personal problem, is a believable and sympathetic story in it's own right. <br/><br/>Having these two people, both with respectable opinions and motivations, clashing with each other is a brilliant catalyst and elevates this film beyond this same plot done with less care. Instead of having a definitive hero, you are left torn throughout the hour and 55 minute runtime, simultaneously rooting for everyone and no one.<br/><br/>The single greatest character growth comes not from either of the aforementioned characters however and instead comes from Sam Rockwell's character, Dixon. At the beginning of the film he is Willoughby's simple minded, temperamental, and slavishly devoted underling. At the end of the movie he grows into a much more focused and understandable person, and this transition from someone you can't imagine loving to the opposite is often entertaining, but far more often, crushing. Rockwell is on my list now as another actor to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>The film's only imperfections come in some of the dialogue. There are a couple (only a couple) times where the dialogue comes off as forced. There's the famous ""deer"" scene and while not the abomination some portray it to be, it definitely comes off as more hokey than sincere. Then there's a scene toward the end of the movie where a person visits her at her place of work that did not make a whole lot of logical sense. These moments are extremely minor and don't preclude the film from being an excellent tale told well.<br/><br/>I've been having good luck with movies lately, and this was no exception. This film has laughs, it has tears and it has real emotion. I was enthralled near every second. There is no obvious hero, and no happy ending. Instead you have real humans going through a series of crushing moments, with all the believable actions and reactions that occur as a result. In less capable hands it could have been a preachy and by the numbers tale we see with the boringly romanticized nature of most ""based on a true story"" projects. Instead, this entirely fictional work is more real than most of them and I have to respect that.<br/><br/>Oh and Tyrion Lannister and Mac's mom from Always Sunny are in the movie. If that doesn't sell you, go back to your home planet."

","First, all the controversy surrounding this movie is a good thing. Great art elicits such responses and I'm for it. The acting, editing and cinematography were extraordinary. McDorland gives a stunning performance of a mother driven to focused and sometimes unfocused fury. Violence suffuses the entire movie, including the violence of foreign wars. This plot thread was, for me, the only real problem with the movie, the ""Idaho"" character makes no sense to the movie, particularly the scene where he comes into the gift store, what was that about? He had no connection to any one in the town, as far as I could tell. Criticism regarding penciled in race issues and characters seem less of an issue, it wasn't that kind of movie, class matters in this movie, violence matters in this movie, southern gothic matters. Most of the criticism focusing on race and deep structural issues in the film are long pieces that go into fine detail why this movie isn't very good, and I like this level of heavy lifting, the movie is not easily dismissed and should be seen and you can come to your own conclusion regarding it's merits (as is always true). But frankly, I'm tired of people going on about what's not in a movie or art generally and not focusing on what is there. What would be an alternate approach that would make sense? This is never discussed."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri would suffice as a nice past time film that is good for a short while but forgettable. This film certainly has its moments and the lazy southern setting has its appeal. The acting is quite good, the cast deliver good performances. A number of people complained about the tone and how loathsome everyone is but that is the theme of this story. It hits the ground running with a blunt but grieving mother wanting some kind of retribution. <br/><br/>While it has its positives it never really crosses the mark into a truly great or captivating film. Something more was needed to get it across the line, whether a surprising twist, conspiracy or revelation of sorts. It never quite gets there and has a number of plot holes, besides the three billboards it lacks symbolism and it never is really resolved in any form. I do not think the viewers have to interpret or 'read into' anything further but the director has left loose ends and incomplete story lines. <br/><br/>This is not a bad film, I could an aspiring film maker winning the top art or film prize at a school or festival. Possibly even the Cannes film festival. However to take home the Oscar for best film would be a stretch. Then again the Oscars have lost credibility when it gave Best Picture to Moonlight last year."

","This is among the most fun I have had at the movies in the last three years, and all without any other-worldly or superhero fanciful b**t. Yes, the story does have its dramatic twists and turns bordering on incredulous at times, but what's a good plot without some of those, and reality can be stranger than fiction. (Take any Shakespeare play for instance.) <br/><br/>The screenplay is fraught with human emotion and serves as an excellent case study of human behavior. A word of caution about what to expect - akin to a lot of good art, the movie's objective is to raise questions and paint a grey picture of the trials of humanity such as regret, grief, anger, revenge, racism without actually providing any firm solution. I think that is what makes it so brilliant and real.<br/><br/>And I have seen very few, if any, performances that are as good as McDormand's in this film. Every bit of muscle, every tiny line on her face appears capable of displaying an incremental change in emotion. It is phenomenal. The full cast is superb, but I particularly also loved Woody Harrelson's turn as Willoughby in a small but critical role.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to watch a movie about human nature and real-life issues.

The movie got no real story to tell, most things happens just because of the right or wrong circumstances, and the whole movie seems kind of pointless in the end. The directors idea I think was to produce the same kind of atmosphere and bizarre humor as in ''In Bruges'' but instead of letting the story itself be the source of laughter much of the jokes are forced in place (some of it very funny though) I get the feeling that the movie think it's both better and funnier than it actually is. 
The acting is good, but to narrow. The characters are actors instead of real life people.<br/><br/>I was never bored and I had some laughs. I wouldn't recommend it for the big screen, but certainly good enough for the couch at home - 7/10"

","This film follows the story of dedicated mother Mildred who longs to find the rapist and murderer of her daughter after police chief Willoughby discontinues the search.

The witty, belligerent, cold-hearted woman you meet in the trailer is truly what you get, though Frances Mcdormand is not the only star of the show. Sam Rockwell (Dixon), Woody Harrelson (Chief Willoughby), and Caleb Landry Jones (Red) are not far behind. Already sporting some nice golden globes, I see Oscar noms (and possibly wins) in the near future for some of these roles. Needless to say, this was so unexpectedly good! I did enjoy Martin McDonagh's ""Seven Psychopaths"" but not nearly as much as I enjoyed ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"". This movie includes the same cold, dark humor, quick twists and unexpected turns but in a much more impactful way.

","Nothing goes where it's suppose to in this movie, well done! The director of ""In Bruges"" does it again here, sardonic, well written, and you get rape/murder, suicide, heavy violence and unexpected moments of humor, kindness and bad behavior. The acting was faultless/inspired, editing spot on, music just right and characters changed and hard to characterize through out. Only real problem is that the supposed ""bad guy"" plotting was off, it's not clear why this guy showed up in the gift shop, no backstory, why this guy from Idaho is in Missouri. The only possible explanation is that it doesn't need an explanation, violence in the US is so ubiquitous and sometimes random, and linking it to unspeakable acts perpetrated by US troops in foreign lands that clearly has an effect back in the US is important. So when Dixon responds to the place with sands comment by saying ""that doesn't narrow it down"" the director is making a point. Still, I don't get the gift shop threat. Also, Abie Cornish had a silly accent, not sure what was happening there, and she was far too young to be the wife, sorry, getting sick of such huge differences in age as if that is ""normal."" These are quibbles though, this is a movie that matters, art versus simple entertainment. You feel the director's power and choices here.

"rcolgan","9","2","4","6 January 2018"," Funny, Emotional and Thought Provoking
","After months without a culprit in her daughter's murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) rents out three billboards (that are located outside Ebbing, Missouri) and puts up the message ""Raped while dying and still no arrests? How come, Chief Willoughby?"" This causes mass outrage from an entire town of colourful characters who adore chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) including a ""fat dentist"", a ""lady with the funny eye"" and Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) a man who recently built a reputation for himself after beating up a black suspect. Or as Mildred colourfully puts it, Dixon has recently entered ""the n***er torturing business"". <br/><br/>Is she in the right to put up the billboards? Is she helping draw attention on her daughter's murder case? Or is she just a rude woman who should stop fighting people she shouldn't consider her enemies? Who knows, but she's doing it anyway. And in a strange way when I watched her stand up against everyone in the entire town I was reminded a little of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. Just like Atticus she knows she's fighting a losing battle and that no matter what she does she will never be able to bring her daughter back. She also knows that it's unlikely that her daughter's killer will ever be found. But none of that matters because this is just something that she believes is the right thing to do. <br/><br/>McDonagh's previous films (Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges) have always been strong at balancing dark humour with thought provoking drama. But unlike his other work, the comedy for the most part is much more nuanced, with more subtle performances and a stronger focus on character development. Though it does still have his distinct language which constantly strives to challenge Goodfellas and South Park for the most swear words per minute of screen time. Plus he's assembled an incredible ensemble cast, all of whom know just how to deliver McDonaghs dialogue and are all memorable in their own way.<br/><br/>But the two standouts in the cast are definitely McDormand and Rockwell. It's kind of surprising seeing McDormand play a role whose personality is so polar opposite to Margo in Fargo. Whenever she's on screen she's such a dominating figure and has a brashness to say whatever she wants, no matter how reckless it is or how much harm it causes. She's also brilliant at delivering McDonagh's language. At the end of it I was pretty sure that I'd enjoy watching an entire film of McDormand just going around town and swearing at people (which to be fair is kind of what I saw). <br/><br/>This film might also be Rockwell's greatest performance yet. He's the image of the cop that Americans fear to see. The kind who thinks that his badge is an excuse to do whatever he wants and not have to face any consequences for it. He does so many hateful and despicable things in the film, but somehow Rockwell never lets you lose all hope for him. You always feel like he's going to do the right thing in the end, even if he's going to do a lot of wrong things first. <br/><br/>At times hilarious, at others sorrowful and constantly thought provoking, Three Billboards is easily McDonagh's greatest work. It's a film that has a certain level of humanity and moral ambiguity that will continue to resonate long after you've watched it."
"texshelters","6","2","4","16 December 2017"," Three Billboards is Nasty and Vindictive and Only Funny to Those that Enjoy Cruelty
","Does having a daughter brutally murdered give you carte blanche to be rude and vicious to others? That is the question I walked away with after seeing Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. The set up is clever, but the delivery is clumsy. And Frances McDormand, who I will always love for Fargo, has one gear in this film: pissed off. Even her grief is pissed off. Some variety in her expressions would have helped. <br/><br/>During the film, Mildred (McDormand) lights things and people on fire, she punches people, she insults everyone, and we are supposed to laugh it off or at least forgive her since her daughter was horribly killed. Unfortunately for the writer and director of this film, the world doesn't work that way. The action in the film was forced and lacked credulity. <br/><br/>Peter Dinklage's character is sympathetic in ways that the protagonist, Mildred, never is. He's charming in his own shy, bumbling way. And Mildred is just an asshole to him. Mildred's son looks confused and two dimensional. I thought McDormand was standing next to a cardboard cut out of him during some scenes. Woody Harrelson as Police Chief Willoughby is incompetent throughout, though the acting is not terrible. Willoughby has failed to find the killer of Mildred's daughter. Then he fails to prosecute Mildred and Police Officer Dixon for clearly breaking the law. It is not plausible. I will give Sam Rockwell props for a job mostly well done for playing the racist, ignorant sexist and making him multidimensional. <br/><br/>Praise the film for being a look at a mother's grief, but don't cheer when she nearly kills someone and treats everyone poorly throughout the film. Rating: Rent it. There is nothing about the film, its music, its look, its staging, to recommend it for the big screen. <br/><br/>Peace,

This is truly an actors' hayride that takes the audience along for the ups, downs, turns and spills; watch what a fine cast can do with a good script. As the story unfolds, the characters are not quite what they seem, sometimes this is refreshing, other times disturbing . . . either way, always interesting.<br/><br/>Very few things pull this movie down, but the sound mix occasionally leaves the audience wondering what was said, jarringly sensual, maybe even unnecessary language cements the ""R"" rating, and the plot, however intriguing, has gaping logic holes in a few places."

The story stems from the death of the hostess's daughter, then the mother rents a billboard to urge the case to be solved, and then others in the town are also involved.
In the end, several protagonists understood each other from the perspective of love. It was not the forgiveness of the Virgin, but the kindness in their hearts made them choose to understand rather than hatred and revenge.
In this story, it is difficult to judge the good or bad of someone. They proceed from their own standpoint and do what they think is right according to their personality. The labels and prejudices when they first met them were ripped off in repeated scolding, tearing, and even arson. Not a strong mother needs to forgive the murderer, not a policeman who beats people, he is unwilling to do justice, and it is not covered with dirty words Zhang is an incompetent father. Of course, there are also non-washable crimes (which must not be forgiven), but, as the sheriff said, kindness makes people calm and calm makes people think. Think about what you should do from a good point of view, and then admit the harm your impulse has caused to others.

I'm not saying she can't be her wife, i'm saying there are so many good 50 or 60 year old actresses around with less work undofrtunately, why not have i don't know a helen hunt?zta jones? andie mcdowell? kim catrall?renee zelweger? just name dropping here.<br/><br/>anyway it's a minor thing. ""three billboards"" is about an america a lot of people forget, and is about the real human beings that live in that america. is about forgive and let go, about love, and most of all about relying on each other. trust and believe. is a movie with a lot of meaning, rich characters and great dialogue that deserves to be remembered. i hope it will be."

","The character begins with a triangle, Hayes, sheriff and Dixon, all of which maintain a wonderful balance at first. Dixon complained for the police, but the sheriff had to find a way to make peace with Hayes while stopping his subordinates from making trouble. But the sheriff's cancer and final self-determination broke the balance and catalysed everything. This sudden death has become a ""material"" for the people in the town to interpret infinitely. Some people think that it is due to the relief of suffering from disease, but more people think that it is suffering from Hayes' humiliation and pressure, more like a decisive counterattack. At the same time, the death has become a strong internal driving force to promote narrative.
Stable start to shake, balanced start to tilt, one corner of the triangle suddenly collapsed, and the other two ends of the game began. And that set off the two fires. As the confrontation in this story reaches its peak, it happens to be the process of both sides entering each other's heart. The sheriff left a letter to everyone, to Hayes and Dixon. His absence turned into a more obvious presence. A confession full of self mockery and humor from the dead was far more powerful than his futile explanation in his life. At this point, the theme set up in ""the good man is hard to find"" has been diluted. Although it is full of violence, all things have finally subsided. The lines on Hayes's face are no longer rigid, and Dixon is no longer so reckless. The angle began to move towards the resultant force. Just like those two fires, seemingly tit for tat revenge, in fact, they are all misunderstandings. After a series of misunderstandings and violence, they accidentally promote reconciliation and softness.
This unexpected change is closer to the truth of life, self righteous judgment, irresolvable estrangement, unexpected and unprovoked disaster, unexplained dawn. People think that they are on the right path, but they may go astray. They believe that the mountains are poor and the waters are flowing again, but they run into the dark.
There is stupidity and violence in this town, but it's not the inside that the film focuses on. It's all the surface. They are finally peeled off layer by layer. Although there are costs, they have experienced blood and fire, but the final result is actually tempered very softly. It starts with heartbreak and ends with liberation. Everyone has scars, Dixon's on the cheek, Hayes's in the heart, but the two finally look at each other and smile. The ending is destined not to put on another crazy ending, but to ""make decisions on the road"" like life itself."

Another outstanding performance is that of Woody Harrelson who seems to be the soul that somehow wants to help in the face of so much violence and barbarism. This film raises many issues, justice by its own hands when there is no answer from who is supposed to protect us, violence and when it is answered only with more violence, because there is a barbarism against the civilized that affects the characters and what to do with our anger on which side to put ourselves after an event as hard as the one that happened to Mildred the character of French.

","If I really want to say this genre, I think it is not a drama or a tragedy or a comedy. It is more like a warm farce combining the three. What must be said should be the main drama, although it has a tragic comedy color, but the theme connotation it has to express is always upward. It is very different from the rules of Chinese film, and its ending is not determined to solve the case, but to the determination to resist sexual assault. This movie is actually a cloak of revenge, and the theme is salvation. The first is the salvation of personality. Director Willoughby 's three letters reveal the true face of each character. Dixon escapes from the fire and truly understands Director Willoughby 's expectation of himself when he knows about alien sexual assault When the author could not enforce the law, he put down the lost badge. The second is self-redemption. Dixon met Reed in the hospital. Reid still put the orange juice beside the bed; he and his mother became allies and went to Iowa, but said ""not really"". They did not find the murderer in the end, but they achieved their liberation. The third is personal salvation. Every character is torn and distorted. Mildred, whose marriage is unfortunately incompatible with children, is extremely stubborn; the only thought in the family is still Dickson, who wants to eliminate the old mother of color He misunderstood what the director thought ""help"" and threw Red downstairs. He was unruly and discriminated against black people. Willoughby director he could not find the truth and could not bear the pain of illness, and chose to commit suicide to avoid everything; but Mildred is persistent It was the nationals who valued sexual assault. At the end of the restaurant, he dropped the wine bottle that he was going to smash to his husband; Dixon went to Iowa with Mildred in order to get the criminal DNA and endure the beatings; Director Willoughby and Mildred talked about ""baby"" after hematemesis; they were all marginal characters in the play, each representing their own injustice, representing the injustice of the United States against people of color; the arrogance of law enforcers and the distortion of personal character, but in the end they Have achieved self-salvation. The characters they are in are tragic, but they hide the tenderness of tenderness everywhere. They did not find the murderer but gained self-liberation. So it is more like a warm farce.
The first impressive segment was that the black director appeared to be expelled. The suppression of people of color in the southern United States has had many metaphorical ironies in shaping Dixon. In the former case, he suppressed Mildred by suppressing people of color, so he did n't want to solve the case. After the death of the chief, he threw Reid out of the window in order to ""revenge"" the chief. He roared at the black man at the door of the police station. The chief appeared the first step to dismiss Dixon, and he also received a letter from the chief after expelling Dixon. At the same time, because of the black chief's relationship, he had to enter the police station late at night to see that the letter was just attacked by Mildred's fire. . These are no coincidences, but the deliberate design of the screenwriter, which suppresses the black people to appear from the black people to change characters, and finally puts the police badge in front of the black people.
The second episode is Mildred 's accidental payment of no money to pay rent. Reed actually compromised here. He gradually began to fear the intimidation of the law enforcers. At this time, the occasional amount of money made Reid unable to refuse. Who knows that this money was also sent by the law enforcers After renewing the rent, the Commissioner passed away, and the billboard was burned. Combining a high degree of contradiction, and finally cracking one by one absurdly, the billboard was actually burned by her ex-husband, and it was the victim of the billboard who continued the money. Tossing and turning, unexpectedly, breaking the audience's imagination, meaning."

","This is quite a thought-provoking film; made all the more remarkable because the principal character ""Mildred"" (Frances McDormand) is really quite a pain in the arse. She comes across as an authoritarian societal ""control freak"" who simultaneously acts as a vigilante when it suits her. Quite quickly, you get to the point where you wonder if she ought not to be in some sort of secure accommodation. All of that said, it is exactly these flaws that make this interesting. Her daughter has been brutally raped and killed and she is constantly berating local sheriff Woody Harrelson for not finding the culprits - to the extent that she hires a billboard and says some not very complimentary things about the local PD. Sam Rockwell is his naively provocative deputy who weighs in to help but merely makes matters worse. The characterisations are maybe a bit too two-dimensional and it certainly plays up to stereotypes of ""hick"" rural America, but it is a powerful performance-driven drama with plenty of conflicting sub-plots (some more plausible than others) and McDormand is super."

","I have not been very fond of earlier films by Martin McDonagh, but this movie has Frances McDormand in the lead role as a woman who puts up those three billboards. It's been a good many months since her daughter was raped while dying, then doused with kerosene and set afire, and she puts up those billboards asking sheriff Woody Harrelson why they haven't arrested anyone.<br/><br/>With McDonagh's earlier movies, the performances have been all over the shop, as if some people are playing a scene for comedy and some for tragedy and no one is talking to anyone else. With McDormand at the center, saying what she is saying, the mood shifts in an instant from comedy to Harrelson's coughing his lungs out without anyone missing a beat. It's one of those instants in a movie that tells you that these actors are inhabiting these characters who have known each other for decades and draws me into the moment and the story far more than anything else could.<br/><br/>I don't know if McDonagh has finally learned how to direct his own material; I suspect that he let McDormand have her own head. Several decades ago, her turn in FARGO had me convinced that Ethan Coen came in one day and said ""Joel, if you don't let Frances play this scene the way she wants, I'm going to be sleeping on the couch for a long time.""
I think she understands these characters and can show them, and McDonagh let her have her head. The proof is on the screen, if you go look at it."

","Don't know if it is a stroke of genius or not, but grieving mother Mildred puts up three big billboards questioning the police about the murder and rape of her daughter. That is how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri starts. Events soon develop, both predictable, like the local police reacting and other more surprising twists and turns. In this story, where facts are few and hard to come by, emotions and reactions are key. But, as it seldon is with emotions, it is not that easy. Mildred is not the only one with grief, heartache and a hard life to handle, and everyone is dealing with it in their own ways. Mildred's billboards just starts the chain reaction.<br/><br/>A deeply rich and dark tale, not without it's own peculiar sense of humor (the movie is labelled as a comedy, although I am not sure if I would stretch it that far. More of a drama to me). The jokes are lifelines in a tale that would otherwise be unbearably dark. But the story is much more than the jokes. There are several storylines, many characters have their own, that intertwine and cross each other. It gives a complex, and many times suprising, twists and developments. The characters are full of their own history and agendas, and no character is a saint or hero, neither villain nor monster.<br/><br/>The cast has been awarded many prizes, deservedly so. Harrelson's character Willoughby might be my favourite, but there are many others, too many to mention. But they do have a rich material to work with, and well directed by McDonagh (his movies is worth keeping a look out for - peculiar as they are in their own ways).<br/><br/>It is a movie that engages fully. Thoughts, reactions and emotions flow as the story unfold. And a little laughter now and then. Highly recommended."

","The main plot of the story is a mother trying to get justice for her daughter who was raped and killed 7 months ago while the cops have no leads. She tries to get this justice by putting up some billboards putting the cops, particularly the chief (Woody Harrelson) on blast. For a movie like this it has a ton of laughs on the way which is why I say genre bending. Her plan worked to and extent in that it brings the case to the forefront but it has a ton of unforeseen ramifications. The chief actually has cancer and winds up killing himself (although he wrote a note saying it wasn't because of her billboards). This inspired a horrible cop in the unit (I think Sam Rockwell) to throw a guy who put the billboards up out of a two story window which causes him to lose his job. You'd think he'd get an assault charge here as well but there's a lot of things like that you have to just overlook in this movie. For whatever reason the same cop that did that also got a note from the chief which inspired him to be a good cop and try to find the killer. He failed but settles on possibly going with that mom to try to kill a different rapist. Oh and the mom burned down the police station and badly burnt Rockwell's face at some point but he ain't mad at her. Sounds like non-sense but the movie's legitimately great."

I appreciated that Woody Harrelson's sheriff is not unsympathetic. He is a pretty good guy. He tried to solve the case, but he is right when it comes to finding no clues. By the way, is anyone reading this growing a little tired of the ""F"" word being used in every other syllable of speech. The cops, townspeople, McDormand, on and on, can't say three words without dropping one of these. Is no effort made to create realistic speech among characters? Almost every police movie or movie with tough guys bends over backward to throw as much profanity around. I'm no prude, but I believe most people go through their days without this heavy artillery. I went to a supermarket yesterday, filled with all kinds of people, and didn't hear the ""F"" word once. Outside of that, if one accepts the premise of this film, it's tragic to watch this woman in her state of rage and guilt. She is a victim, but has no qualms about inflicting venom on others, including children. The police are ineffectual and one, Dixon, is a caricature. He is a great caricature, but so over the top, it's hard to imagine someone like him existing."

","Written, Produced & Directed by Martin McDonagh, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', is a film so dark & timely, that it makes you laugh till it hurts. This riveting tale on anger & grief, is told with command & power. And the Performances are Incredible!<br/><br/>'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' Synopsis: A mother (A Firebrand Frances McDormand) personally challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter's murder when they fail to catch the culprit.<br/><br/>'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the kind of film, that uses anger as its energy & rage as its heart. Watching McDormand, the grieving & raging protagonist, challenge the local authorities & await the culprit behind her daughter's brutal death, is a mix of delicious dark humor & racial violence. <br/><br/>So while you have McDormand as the bad-ass, there is also a strong supporting role, played by a wild Sam Rockwell. As the hillbilly cop, Rockwell is tempered, foul-mouthed, violent & unforgiving. He's the cop you wouldn't want to come across if you ever happen to be in Missouri. And that's exactly what makes 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' such a delightful mix of contrasting rage. Its the same emotion that the characters go through here, with the only difference being how they go about it. While the cop uses his hands and legs to break bones, the protagonist adds toughness to herself by putting up Billboards. As I mentioned earlier before, here's a film that uses anger as its energy & rage as its beating heart!<br/><br/>McDonagh's Screenplay is top-notch. Its no-holds-barred & a depiction of an America, we don't usually explore in movies. Its power-packed stuff, with some delicious, unexpected twists & turns. McDonagh's Direction is brilliant, too. McDonagh has handled this dark-comedy/crime-drama with precision. Oscar Glory, seems possible! Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, merit a special mention. Carter Burwell's Score is soothing, as always. Costume Design & Make-Up are well-done, as well.<br/><br/>And now to the performances! Frances McDormand is simply superb! As the grieving & raging protagonist, McDormand expresses rage, helplessness & courage, with magnificence. Its a sheer pleasure to watch McDormand take on the local tough boys & scream her rage with the Billboards. This is her finest performance in years. <br/><br/>Also in terrific form is Woody Harrelson, as the cop who McDormand throws her righteous rage at. Harrelson's sheriff is a soft man, who understands the wrath of a grieving mother as well as accept his inability to catch the culprit. He also has a nice sub-plot with his family, with whom he shares his emotional connect. Harrelson delivers a restrained, controlled performance, proving us once again that he's versatile performer.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell plays it crazy & has a blast! His turn as the racially aggressive cop is hard to beat. Rockwell attacks the role full throttle. As Rockwell's outrageous mother, Sandy Martin is a hoot. Her performance comes close to stealing the entire film. Please give her some attention this awards season! <br/><br/>Of the rest of the cast, Caleb Landry Jones, John Hawkes, Peter Dinklage & Lucas Hedges stand out with impressive supporting turns. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is a knockout! This is one of the best American films of the year! Don't Miss It."

","Between Bruges and Missouri, if being a writer/director weren't enough, Martin McDonagh could seemingly easily find an alternate calling as an unorthodox travel agent. Of course, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is as much a straight- faced travelogue of the Midwestern United States as McDonagh's In Bruges is a gentle comedy of tourism - namely, not at all. McDonagh's films defy easy categorization with as much flamboyance and vitriolic wit as they subvert narrative expectation, with twists and inversions as wacky as they are devastatingly human. And Three Billboards may be his sharpest, most tenderly sadistic cross-section of human behaviour yet, exemplifying his customary deftness for unpacking the weird, terrible, and unexpectedly graceful decisions people make under intolerably extreme circumstances. Even more impressively: he fans the flames with a seasoning of searing sociopolitical urgency amidst the salty banter and unexpected bursts of extreme violence, before pulling the rug out from under us once again for something altogether more moving and raw. <br/><br/>Taking its place with The Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Square as 2017's (unintentional but perfectly pairing) tryptic of sordidly funny meditations on karma and retribution,* Three Billboards adopts an a grandiose, almost Biblical sensibility in its darkly comedic morality play. Characters gradually, painstakingly, learn to try turning the other cheek when running perilously low on vision due to all the 'eye for an eye's, as McDonagh's razor-sharp screenplay adopts a pendulum structure of 'action/reaction/escalation' that becomes increasingly poignant as things careen increasingly out of control. Initially, this ping-ponging of aggression lends the film an affably clumsy, episodic feel, but it's only retroactively clear how carefully-knit McDonagh's writing is, neatly baiting and subverting expectations with coy foreshadowing and red herrings aplenty, with the jaw-dropping spurts of extreme, unexpected violence upstaged only by the seismic power of quiet but instrumental character revelations that McDonagh airdrops in with equally gleeful whimsy. <br/><br/>McDonagh is unmistakably a playwright, and his founding sensibilities root the film in an impressively tense, pressure-cooker claustrophobia. Granted, the snappiness of his viciously eloquent, don't-call-it-Tarantinoesque, dialogue is undercut ever so slightly by the proliferation of transitional establishing shots, buoyed by Carter Burwell's sumptuously sonorous musical score, that privilege elegiac pause over the film's otherwise breakneck, almost screwball comedy pacing. Still, these micro-pauses of deliberation are crucial for not having the audience fanned into a similar fury of indignation as the characters, allowing us a more dispassionate, if not unemotional, take on an increasingly incendiary allegory. <br/><br/>Because here's the rub: amidst all of the bluster, banter, and hyperbolic escalation, Three Billboards is, at its core, a cutting rumination on the current combustible climate of police brutality being taken to task. McDonagh weighs in, appropriately scathingly, on the infuriating, seething impotence in the face of systemic corruption and toxic, discriminatory violence running so deep. At the same time, he vehemently insists on painting every wrinkle of every side with human error shades of grey, and resists the temptation to fully dive down the rabbit hole of larger-than-life fantasy escape into righteously indignant cathartic retribution, a-la Inglourious Basterds, with Frances McDormand's furiously grieving mother its surrogate Aldo Raine. Justice, McDonagh insists, is more than balance, and flecks of unexpected condemnation and redemption colour all sides and individuals, no matter what preconceived roles they slot into. In short, McDonagh's characters are all far too human not to err, but far too human not to understand and forgive in the midst of their doing so. And that, if anything, lends for a well-balanced, contemporary pseudo-Biblical morality parable, even if McDonagh customarily finds his scripture in swearing here.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is truly extraordinary, imbuing everything from a monologue to a fleeting glance with captivating magnetism and furious emotional weight. Inhabiting a woman carved down by fury and grief into an almost primal human flame of rage, McDormand's flinty composure only occasionally flickers to betray the cavernous guilt and sadness beneath. In spite of this, she's also savagely funny, and her diatribes shutting down a kindly priest and vacuous reporter as accountable for feeding into a broken system couldn't be more a more riotously cathartic mouthpiece for a year full of such infuriating real-life sociopolitical strife. Sam Rockwell similarly delivers some of the most dazzlingly funny and compellingly nuanced of his career, in a performance fuelled by as much misguided rage as by puppy-dog pathos. As Dixon, a small-town Midwestern cop reviled as racist and abusive, Rockwell takes a character we're hardwired to hate and dismiss, and works tirelessly to make us understand and confront the man within the stereotype, while being careful not problematically stray into the territory of misguided folk hero - he's far too brutally honest and sweepingly human for that. Woody Harrelson is equally exceptional, drawing up undercurrents of unexpected elegance and wry humour into a role that equally defies expectation, intriguingly sashaying from antagonist to protagonist scene-by-scene. Lucas Hedges, Abbie Cornish, John Hawks, and Caleb Landry Jones all find their beats of sardonic hilarity and gut-punching humanism with remarkable ease, while Samara Weaving is almost unspeakably funny in her few, fleeting moments, and Peter Dinklage is almost overpoweringly lovable as seemingly the film's only wholly redeemable character. <br/><br/>Just like its titular signage, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri functions as a cultural object dropped in amongst an unsuspecting public, to fan flames, incite conversation and controversy, confront prejudices, and, hopefully, lead to life-changing revelations in perspective. It's an astonishingly intricate and fundamentally human think-piece, and the occasional wobbles in pacing and politics do little to mar its standing as one of the year's most unforgettable films. Still, I'll take Bruges over Missouri - in more ways than one. <br/><br/>-9/10 <br/><br/>*There's an amusing poignancy in three of the year's most inevitable Oscar contenders involving extreme karmic consequences for loss. Academy members better bar their second floor windows before considering voting unfavourably for McDonagh's film"

"imseeg","3","3","8","30 December 2018"," NOT true to life. So very much NOT true to life that this story becomes ridiculous.
","This is suppose to be a drama. Drama needs a credible story. It hasnt got one. It is just a continous cop bashing story with no credibility in the story whatsoever. Only if the leading character would have been a terrorist or a psychotic serial killer this story would have rung true. But all these crimes (firebombing the police office) are done by a rational and intelligent middle aged mother who runs a souvenir shop. Has anyone EVER seen a mother firebomb a policestation, because the cops didnt solve the murder of her daughter? More of this kind of nonsense though is what you can expect in ""3 billboards"".<br/><br/>I suspect there must have been a (politically correct) reason why this ludicrous silly movie got so many awards, in America only. Maybe American people are so fed up with police brutality that they will praise any picture, in which roles are reversed and cops get terrorized for a change, instead of black and gay people. Literal quote from the movie indicating this cop bashing theme: ""if you got rid of all the cops with vaguely racist leanings, you'd have only have three cops left. And all of them would hate fags.""<br/><br/>However interesting reversing stereotypical roles may sound, (even in relation to police brutality), any drama still needs a credible story. And credibility is lacking big time in this silly picture, because of the ridiculous behaviour by the leading character who plays a firebombing mom (Frances McDormand). One just cant take her seriously halfway through the movie anymore. Her anger maybe true to life. For sure. Her complaints may be justified. But her actions just are ridiculous and make a laughing stock of this movie. An intelligent mom who is firebombing a police station and then they expect to be taken seriously? Who are they kiddin'?<br/><br/>Or is all this sillyness suppose to be funny? It isnt a black comedy either to me. Or is it? Then I must have forgotten to laugh a single time..."

","Usually, when there's a crime involved in a movie, it gets solved by the end. You at least know what happened. But apparently, this really isn't about the crime at all. This one seems to be about a small town where police and angry citizens can be as foul-mouthed and violent as they like without legal consequences. In real life, where I come from, there are always legal consequences to violent behaviour. I didn't find any of it funny and I found a lot of it really stupid and pointless, like when Mildred fire-bombed the police station. There was also no good reason for Willoughby to shoot himself in the head, either. What a cowardly and mentally cruel thing for a cancer patient to do to his family. And the one person I honestly wish Dixon had shot was his drunken, narcissistic mother just to shut her up for once and for all! And then there was the ridiculous ""phone rang"" ending. I wasted two hours of my life waiting for that?! I will never understand what all the critical acclaim was about because I didn't see a nanosecond of entertainment value in this whatsoever."

"firstfloorstudioscontact","9","3","8","13 February 2018"," Best film of 2018!
","I loved this film. Without a doubt, this might just be the best film of 2018. The story was just so amazing, and tragic, and beautiful. It's very rare that a film can have just such perfect casting, but this is certainly one of them.<br/><br/>The director (Martin McDonagh) captured everything that I like in films, a great story, a great cast, beautiful shots, and a perfect ending. Right off the bat, you're in the film, you know whats going on because it is so clear.<br/><br/>The film was so beautifully shot with a perfect set of locations and a story. Character development is something that is very important and not many films can do it as well as Martin McDonagh has done here. You start the film with the impression of Frances McDormand's character Mildred to be this incredibly tough woman who just wants justice for her daughter. But as the film progresses, we see that she is just like everyone else. When Woody Harrelson's character Willoughby gets properly sick and coughs blood on Mildred, her face just turns, and so do the audience's. You aren't sure what's going to happen, will she get mad? Or will she reassure him and be kind. She immediately changes everyones hearts, she is a mother at heart, this was the first thing to the audience that made her feel just that bit more real.<br/><br/>Willoughby dies in the film, and not from his cancer, he decides to take his life. He leaves letters for everyone. What struck me most about this is what he said, and the though process his character went through. ""I don't want your lasting memory of me to be in a hospital bed"". Looking back on it, it was always going to happen, Willoughby has one amazing day with his kids and wife, he seems okay, even though there's billboards out there with his name on it. Honestly Woody Harrelson's character was just so amazing, and would not have worked with any other actor.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell's character Dixon is another great example of character development. From being a racist, to crying to his dear friends death, to catching fire, to then forgiving Mildred for it and going on an adventure with her to kill a bad man... okay so maybe he didn't change all that much. But throughout the duration of the film I hated him. But coming to the end, where he goes to Mildred to tell her he thinks he knows who killed her daughter, even though it was wrong, it still makes me so happy that Martin McDonagh made the entire theatre change their minds. Just like Woody Harrelson, it couldn't have been played by anyone else.<br/><br/>The film ends with us still not knowing who killed Mildred's daughter, but knowing that Dixon and Mildred are off to hunt a man, who has raped, and that they are going to serve him justice, maybe not in the way that most people would, but in a way that suits their characters.<br/><br/>Overall, such an amazing film, would 100% recommend that you go and to see it in theatres for the full experience. I still wouldn't rate this 5/5, only because I believe that there is always room to improve. I personally would've explained Mildred's son a bit more, I felt like he was just there for the ride and had no proper significance to the film. I still enjoyed his character though.<br/><br/>I would 100% recommend this film, make it a day out with your friends, have a meal afterwards. It is honestly one of my favourite films."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri<br/><br/>Without roadside billboards out of control vehicles would just careen into an empty farmer's pasture. <br/><br/>Luckily, the small-town in this drama has an excess of advertisement opportunity.<br/><br/>Fuming over the fact that the local sheriff (Woody Harrelson) still hasn't arrested any suspects in the rape/murder of her teenage daughter 7-months ago, Mildred (Frances McDormand) purchases ad space on three billboards and uses them to taunt the sheriff and his inept and racist deputy (Sam Rockwell).<br/><br/>Messing with the authorities, however, only brings the hammer down harder on Mildred, her family and her friends. Fortunately, everyone else in Ebbing is as fed up with the law enforcement as her.<br/><br/>In spite of its many strong performances and complex script that blends comedy with tragedy, this fictitious narrative comes off slightly unrealistic, malicious and almost laughable at the end.<br/><br/>Besides, to really distract drivers from the road you need 3 digital billboards.

"TheOny13","10","3","8","3 February 2018"," One of the best movies of 2017! (Spoiler free review)
","I saw this movie because I knew of its Oscar buzz and I wanted to see if it's worth it. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri tels the story of Mildred Hayes who 7 months after her daughter died and with the police not doing anything to try to catch the culprit, she posts three billboards to let anyone know how incompetent the police men are. From there the whole town jumps on her and we got ourselves a movie.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of other great movies that I saw, because the movie itself is very realistic and very original in its concept, you know the feeling when you watch too much garbage for too long and then a diamond like this movie comes along and reminds you that there can be great movies every year. It also takes you in directions that you never expected the movie to go (I mean literally, not like Star Wars The Last Jedi where there were no new directions) and pretty much reminded me of movies like The Dark Knight or Fight Club or Shawshank Redemption for instance. I was at times ""Wow, I was completely not expecting that and that is awesome!"" due to some unexpected twist and due to the fact that the story always had something new to offer and show to me. Another thing I'd like to point out are the performances which were all top-notch. Starting with Frances McDormand who was just awesome in this role and I understand why she got nominated for an oscar (which she'll probably win too), then Sam Rockwell who was just brilliant in his character which evolved throughout the movie, then Woody Harrelson too and not to forget to mention Peter Dinklage who for the amount of screen time he gets does a magnificent job with his performance. Another thing that I really appreciated in the movie was the vulgarity. Now hold your horses... I'm not saying that I like a movie more if it has language vulgarity I'm just saying I liked how and when it was used in this film. It wasn't like F-bomb here and there all the time to make the movie more bad-ass because it has vulgarity and not a good story but it was used with finese only when it should have been. I mean persons that had a motive for using it were using it or if the situation (like the trailer shows) needed vulgarity in order to get some things straight (unlike in Logan where it was used just to improve the movie while being never encountered in any Wolverine movie before). The score was also very good... and it was really nice to see a realistic movie having a great score, it really amplifies the overall value of the movie. If I had one problem with the movie, it might be the ending which for me was a little underwhelming but it didn't ruin the overall enjoyment I had with this movie. <br/><br/>In conclusion, really great movie with great story, performances and music worthy of all the nominations it got and worthy of many wins also because this movie is along with Dunkirk my favorite movie of 2017. 10/10"
"michaelnicholasluciano","4","3","8","26 January 2018"," But why?
","What was the desired message supposed to be of this movie?<br/><br/>Sure, the cast is great. The cinematography is great. The music is great. But the theme and tone of the movie are so nonsensical it leaves the viewer conflicted. There is barely and redemption or consequence for all of the swearing, raping, threatening and hostility that takes place over the movie to the point where it becomes completely unrelatable. It was just a string of deplorable events all taking place after one another ultimately feeling meaningless. <br/><br/>Its hard to align with any protagonist or character when the script demands that they have no attributable human characteristics. McDormand does a great job on what was given to her in the script but 2 1/2 hours of rhetorical Tarantino lines to other characters and nearly all characters living out some campy stereotypes leaves MUCH to be desired."

","What normally works fine in the movies of Martin McDonagh, the mix of comedy, drama and crime, does not work here. Unless you're not a complete madman you won't laugh about topics of racism and sexual murder which are the main themes of this movie. This is not Fargo (what it want's to be, but darker) or a 70ies Explotation Movie, where everything can happen and you will laugh about it, because you are stoned. The cast is very good, the movie is as good made as you would expect it from a talented director.

The acting was good in that the characters present themselves in one way and then all switch to the other by the end of the film. Sam is the shining star here as a mentally retarded cop who can't decide if he's a good guy or a bad guy -- totally unpredictable. While I did not enjoy the movie, I am on board with his award as best actor for this roll. Overall, definitely not the best movie of the year (did nobody see ZOOKEEPER'S WIFE)?

Things get steadily worse when it is revealed that Willoughby, the town's chief named in one of the billboards, has cancer. <br/><br/>The movie has that amazing, rare ability to carefully balance humour and darkness at the same time. It weaves in various social issues through Mcdonagh's signature wit and political incorrectness. One minute I was tearing up at the sad predicament some of the characters were going through, the next, I was laughing my head off at their hilarious dialogue.<br/><br/>It's a movie about female rage at the lack of interest in finding justice for sex crimes.

"CANpatbuck3664","9","3","8","27 December 2017"," Three Billboards Keeps You Guessing and Boasts a Sharp Darkly Comedic Wit
","I didn't fall in love with this movie immediately. I found it funny from the get go but I had to work my way into it. The biggest reason that this movie won me over was how daring and unpredictable the plot was. Every time I was getting settled in, it felt like the movie slapped me awake with some new twist. I mean this in the best possible way. Everyone complains when it comes to Hollywood, there's nothing new under the sun so if someone does something original, its only fair to heap praise upon them. Three Billboards is certainly its own thing, we go from extremely vulgar humour (cleverly written but vulgar) to a character committing murder in a heartbeat. This could have been jarring and it was, but the movie is written so well that I ended up appreciating it because it was different, and it worked far more often than it didn't.<br/><br/>If you can't agree with my sentiments on the plot of Three Billboards, maybe we can find common ground over the deep and surprising character development the movie boasts. Three Billboards is one of those movies where there aren't defined heroes or villains (minus a supporting character that comes in late) and everyone operates in morally grey territory. You go in thinking you're going to be rooting for Mildred (Frances McDormand) going up against Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Dixon (Sam Rockwell) and the system to get justice for her daughter. Its not that simple and I think you'll be surprised how much your flipping your allegiances back and forth as the movie goes on. You have characters that are complete degenerates who find a soul and a will to be decent and others that seem to lose their humanity along the way. Again, you couple this with how shocking the story turns can be and you have a movie to stand up and take notice of.<br/><br/>I think the cast of Three Billboards is good the whole way around. I would say you have one amazing performance, the rest of the cast is solid and then one that I didn't like as much. They should probably give Frances McDormand the Oscar for her work as Mildred right now. The character is interesting outside of her performance but McDormand makes Mildred a character you can't take your eyes off of. She performs amazingly, she has to convey every emotion and there were moments I was laughing and then the next instant I was almost ready to cry because of her performance. Harrelson hits the right balance as Willoughby. Mildred is such a force of nature that Harrelson probably had to dial it back a little but the interplay between the 2 of them is funny yet very heartfelt. Rockwell is always good at playing a dummy and he does a great job as Dixon. He has the most complete emotional arc to work with and he impresses with it. This is probably my favourite Caleb Landry Jones performance. I never thought he was a bad actor, I just hadn't really seen him standout yet, he accomplished that here. It was nice to see Peter Dinklage in a good supporting part and I liked John Hawkes and Zeljko Ivanek in their small roles. I feel bad because I liked her in other things but I thought Abbie Cornish was miscast. Her accent was all over the place and she just seemed off.<br/><br/>I obviously really enjoyed this movie, I wouldn't be rating it a 9 otherwise. My only minor complaint is that the score bugged me. It was just random and I didn't think it meshed with the rest of the movie. I would caution too (even though I didn't mind it) that this movie is unrelentingly dark. I know that might seem like me nitpicking but there were 4 or 5 times where I audibly gasped because I couldn't believe how deep the movie waded into a dreary and uncomfortable place.<br/><br/>This isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but I really dug this movie for what it was. It does what it wants to do and doesn't care if it appeals across the movie going spectrum. I'm not very familiar with Martin McDonagh's past work but I'm paying attention now. If your sense of humour skews toward the dark and you want to see a fresh and well acted movie, go see Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri. I'd give this an 8.5/10 rounded up to a 9/10."

","Writer And Director Martin McDonagh (who's previous films were In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths) returns with his latest film ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" and in all seriousness it is the best film he has done. It's no wonder why this film is getting awards left right and center. <br/><br/>The plot is as good and simple as it can be: Mildred is depressed and grieving over the killing and rape of her daughter. She lives in a world of misery and in a world where she will never smile nor say anything nice to anybody. She is a grieving Mother who decides to challenge the authorities to find her daughter's killer by putting up Three Billboards. The local Sheriff(s) get really annoyed with this and start to take action. <br/><br/> Frances McDormand plays Mildred and she takes on the role so so well! She could have played the whole movie in such a depressed way (which is exactly how her character is), but she decides to be a depressed, broken Mother making witty and crude jokes around every corner, and Frances McDormand does it so well! It's as if the role was written for her. Woody Harrelson plays Willoughby, a local Sheriff who is very tough, but at the same time can sympathize with Mildred. He plays his role so well and steals the first half of the movie. The second half of the movie lies in the hands of Sheriff Dixon (played by Sam Rockwell.) Dixon comes across as a cold blooded monster who does nothing but drink all day and live with his mother, but the more we get to know his character the more we start to realize he's not a little mummy's boy who is mean and drunk, it all starts showing just how good at his job he really is. Dixon is also a racist person, but as more stuff happens to him during the film we start to realize he opens up to reality and life a little more. Sam Rockwell is also another reason I believe they wrote this character for! <br/><br/>All in all this will be my last review of this year. But the music is incredible, the cinematography is beautiful, the editing is astounding and like I said before the acting is amazing. Without spoiling the ending this movie has a strong message ""How far will you go for revenge?"" But Frances Mcdormand and Sam Rockwell totally deserve the Oscar for their roles. <br/><br/>The movie could have been an all through drama, but Martin McDonagh decides instead of making us all focus on all the depression ad pain he decides to make us have a chuckle and laugh at least every minute or two! It's all thanks to the actors for making it all dramatic and comedic at the same time! Absolutely stunning film. I'm giving it 5/5 stars. If you haven't seen it go and see it. You will not be disappointed. I loved every second of it. Jay (one of The Autistic Reviewers)."

","Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is not the easiest person to live with. Far from a Town and Country mom she is acrimoniously divorced and had a rocky relationship with a young daughter who has been murdered by someone still on the loose. Frustrated with local authorities who she sees dragging their feet regarding the investigation she rents three abandoned billboards along a stretch of a secondary road and disses the local authority, a popular chief (Woody Harrelson) with terminal cancer. Town folk are less than pleased with his treatment and matters escalate when a venal Barney Fife like deputy oversteps his authority.<br/><br/>In Billboards writer, director, English import Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Six Shooter) drags his steamer trunk of gratuitous violence and incredulous plot twist to middle America tightening somewhat the bloodletting faucet but the credulity once again stretches beyond the borders of realism which diminishes the film beyond repair. <br/><br/>Francis McDormand's uncompromising Mildred simply carries the film from end to end with a stubborn resolve. You find yourself sympathizing but never really embracing her due to her emotional myopia. A plausible conclusion might make her the villain in the piece, the townsfolk certainly feel that way. Sam Rockwell's goober like Dixon is over the top early but eventually settles well into his transition period but the stretch is too broad the damage for the most part done to make it convincing.<br/><br/>Where Billboards wobbles from the outset is tourist McDonagh's approach to the community. Most of the locals are portrayed as ignorant clichés and as in past films he employs copious violence and bloodletting with minimal injury. Add the fact Mildred commits about a half dozen major felonies before heading off into the sunset with Dixon makes it more than clear McDonagh has not left his preposterous storytelling behind in 3 Billboards that never fully settles as absurdist dark comedy or stark drama."

The performances are near all pro as the on screen chemistry is top notch form with veterans Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, and Frances McDormand(perhaps her best role ever).<br/><br/>Set in Ebbing, Missouri in this small town a brutal murder has just taken place that being of a young teenage girl and her mother Mildred(Frances)has chosen to take matters into her own hands by putting up three billboards right in the heart of town to show the locals and also to question authorities as to why the brutal murder and rape of her daughter is still unsolved, as most of all she calls out the local sheriff Willoughby(Woody Harrelson).<br/><br/>After this the whole town and media starts to take notice and Mildred will not back down as she puts up with county politics and the red tape from the corrupt and mostly white bread police department. Fun and a pleasure to watch is the conflict and coming to terms that Mildred has with deputy Dixon(in a real head turner from Sam Rockwell)who's a go against the grain local cop who's a little slow with smarts and grammar yet he does the job his way.<br/><br/>Overall this is a film of pain and grief and it's a truth seeker, yet it's a stand up outspoken showcase that shows be blunt and outspoken as when answers are needed do it your way and you often have to go against the grain just like the Mildred character. Overall this is one of the better crime dramas I've seen in awhile as it searches for answers and seeks truth in an old fashioned outspoken and blunt kind of way."

","If Martin McDonagh wasn't already on your ""great new writers/directors"" list after In Bruges' steady increase in popularity (holy crap, that was nine years ago!? Does ""new"" still apply?), Three Billboards should cement him on it. I think this film will go down as one of the more underrated gems of the year, and slowly gain popularity as time goes on, similar to the aforementioned In Bruges and what I hope for last year's The Nice Guys.<br/><br/>The movie is a dark comedy, through and through, and it supplies ample amounts of both. The movie does get heavy, but even in the darkest moments, keeps the audience smiling with the consistent off- beat, biting, witty remarks from its equally colorful characters. I keep bringing it up, but if you've seen In Bruges, you know the drill here. Tonally, Three Billboards is of course similar, but not at all a rehash. There's plenty of new content and characters to digest here.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, the cast is perfect in this movie. Each of the headliners (McDormand, Harrelson, Rockwell) is three- dimensional, and they all get their share of comedic and dramatic scenes. All three are perfect. This is one of the best acted movies I've seen all year. <br/><br/>There were a few points throughout the movie where some particularly abrupt drama/comedy tonal shifts felt a bit awkward, and as a result the intended comedic effect didn't land like it otherwise would have. For the most part, the film (and McDonagh's work as a whole) pulls this off adroitly-and let's be honest, it's a tough tactic to consistently pull off. All in all, the movie will make you sad, it will make you angry, and it will make you laugh, occasionally all at the same time. It also has something genuine to say about the dichotomy of anger and love."
"paul-allaer","7","3","8","24 November 2017"," Exposing the ugly underbelly of a small Midwestern town
","""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017 release; 115 min.) brings the story of Mildred Hayes. As the movie opens, we see her driving by several unused dilapidated billboards near her house. She inquires with the Ebbing Advertising Agency (located across the street from the Police Department), and decides to put up three billboards. Combined, they read: Raped While Dying/And Still No Arrests""/How Come. Chief Willoughby? We learn that her daughter Angela was murdered 7 months ago, and that no suspects have been identified by the cops. OF course, this public shaming does not sit well with Chief Willoughby, and he decides to pay Mildred a visit (his first since the murder, Mildred remarks). At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Martin McDonagh, who previously gave us ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths"". While those movies were over the top in many ways, here McDonagh goes a more subtle yet still hard-hitting way in looking at how one strong-willed woman upsets the fabric of a little Missouri town and along the way exposes its ugly underbelly. If you have seen the movie's trailer (and it was hard to escape that in recent weeks), one might expect something very similar, at least in style, to McDonagh's earlier movies, rip-roaring from start to finish. But that is not the case at all. Yes, of course there are those moments, but there there are also many other scenes in the movie that are reflective and outright touching. As hard-boiled as Mildred seems to be, the real hurt and grieving she displays on occasion says a lot more about her than when she kicks some school kids in a place where it hurts (yes, she really does). McDonagh brings out wonderful performances, none more so than the one-of-a- kind Frances McDormand as Mildred. McDormand must at this point surely be considered the front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar early next year. But she gets plenty of help, including Sam Rockwell (as the sleazy and racist officer Dixon), and Woody Harrelson (as Chief Willoughby),<br/><br/>""Three Billboards"" premiered this Fall to immediate critical acclaim, which for the most part is well deserved. (I personally felt a bit let down by the movie's concluding 15 min., which of course I will not spoil.) The Thanksgiving early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers FL, was attended nicely (about 15- 20 people) but nowhere near a sell-out. It will be interesting to see how the movie does at the box office as it gets a wider release in weeks to come. Martin McDonagh is certainly no ordinary writer- director and if you appreciate hiss off-kilter approach, you will welcome his latest. I encourage you to check out ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"Pzachlen","10","3","8","23 November 2017"," a new breed of playwright for the cinema
","Thought provoking seems to be a dirty idea for the film industry. Audiences are not accustomed to such a alien form of entertainment. Martin McDonagh style will not be everyone's cup-a, and thank the Gods it is not. Any great new art form is never realized by the masses. Three Billboards was my third taste of his for cinema. My first was a Broadway play, best and most original and violent piece I had ever seen on the stage.<br/><br/>Seven Psychopaths was the best script that year but the film within a film within another film went over the heads of most. <br/><br/>Three Billboards is not nearly as funny but oh so remarkable, <br/><br/>People will undoubtedly compare his style to Quentin Tarantino but that would be a mistake. The main difference is Tarantino's DNA is all about being COOL.His total identity is to be COOL. <br/><br/>McDonagh's is far more intriguing and human.<br/><br/>I would love to see his take on the current ridiculous witch hunt in Hollywood as to who touched who, who grabbed what. Do they really expect people to take this seriously. The casting couch has been around since silent films. It comes with the territory if one wants to play. Yes there are Pigs that can take advantage of girls.Trust me they take advantage of men just as frequently, maybe more.<br/><br/>Years ago I was asked by my best friend to be an extra in a Halloween Scene meant to be NYC. In that scene I was told to stand next to Salma Hayek when out of nowhere she grabbed my ass. I've been having nightmares ever since, and that was at least 20 years ago.SHOULD I SUE? LOL.<br/><br/>Three billboards has so many scenes to be cherished, but the one which is in the only flashback, will send chills up your spine to alert you as to why the mother is so obsessed to find the one person responsible for raping,killing and burning her daughter. The GUILT,Oh so much guilt."
"yiw2000","10","3","9","6 March 2018"," a movie should be given the oscar
","I will be honest. I lived in US for over 20 years, but I cannot follow completely the dialog, the culture background and some logic in this movie. But felt whole heartedly why the characters in the movies act the way they act. This is the power of the movie, I think it goes beyond language.<br/><br/>It seemed so to incomprehensible to a person with modern concept why they are so full of hatred, full of discrimination and always resort to violence to solve their problem. But to me, it is just a indication of how people feel so week inside wanted to be heard. A mom of a victim of crime, a cop with failed grade and low IQ, a midget, a gay agent... They stood their ground, defending their position helplessly and ridiculously, but yet they found (eventually) a peace inside from each other.<br/><br/>The depth of emotion that reflects the human nature is so strong that you cannot ignore it. <br/><br/>The oscar, as it turns out now that went to the shape of water, should, by comparison, have given to this one. And I think Woody deserves an oscar too."
"kaptenvideo-89875","10","3","9","3 February 2018"," I honestly don't remember rating a movie 10/10. Most are not that close to ideal. ""Ebbing"" is.
","Woah, didn't see that coming. I have stumbled across a perfect movie. I honestly can't remember the last time I gave 10 out of 10, because almost all of them could be better in some small but important regard.<br/><br/>But this is one of those rarest of times when the perfect score seems only fitting. ""Ebbing"" is such a joy in more than one way, unexpected pleasure bomb of a movie, a magnificent achievement in every major aspect, that could not be better in any realistic way.<br/><br/>I mean, theoretically everything could be better in some way, but I stress ""any realistic way"". The makers seem to have achieved everything they were aiming for, and they aimed for top marks.<br/><br/>You could call it a black comedy and that's surely how the have promoted it, but like the best of what modern cinema and series have to offer, it doesn't really cling to any strict genre.<br/><br/>There's comedy, mostly the sort of what many would call cruel, but funny and always razor sharp. There's some moving, authentic drama that will just break your silly little heart. And although there's not much action, there's also at least a hint of violence - the delicious, movie-style violence which will shock you at times but is eminently watchable all the same.<br/><br/>And all that is built on irresistible cocktail of writer-director clearly on top of his game, knowing exactly what he has wants to show and say, and then letting it happen through story, dialogue and performances so precisely formed, striking, original and enjoyable that it makes most of the other movies seem kind of amateurish (2017 or any other year, take your pick).<br/><br/>""Ebbing"" also has a helluva cast of thespians, including Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges, Caleb Landry Jones, Peter Dinklage, John Hawkes, Zelijko Ivanek... Or movie lover's dream for short, every performer committed and on his/her usual top quality level.<br/><br/>No point of waxing lyrical about all of their virtues, this is the best ensemble any moviemaker - or, indeed, viewer - could ask for. I will save you and myself some time and just say: they will make you glad that you are movie lover.<br/><br/>It's not acting, it's the gates of heaven opening up and sending you your own personal Frances McDormand, one of the best actresses in the history of American movies, ready to insult and attack you (verbally) in myriad inventive ways. Supported by so many great performances by others that you wouldn't have enough fingers to count them all.<br/><br/>McDonagh has not only added a lot of colorful characters - it's not an achievement in itself - but has also given attention to and found room for everybody, so they feel like a meaningful addition to what's happening on screen.<br/><br/>Even the smaller roles by actors that I haven't even mentioned feel like they are justified to exist, they are not just helping to move the plot along. Everybody feels like a human being, not a character or plot device.<br/><br/>And all this is done, somehow, with McDormand's character surely in the center, never losing sight from her story and importance of tying everything together. That's a masterclass in writing if there ever was one!<br/><br/>Not to mention the dialogue which is always fresh, brutal in its honesty and always able to surprise you a little. The same goes to story itself, which finds a lot of ways to surprise, and not twist and turn as you would yould expect.<br/><br/>All this yakking, and I haven't even mentioned that the story is deep too. This dimension is what gives the movie its true flavor, and at the same time makes it hard to stomach to many.<br/><br/>On this deeper level, ""Ebbing"" is about the irrational rage that is eating the modern man, you, me and seemingly everybody.<br/><br/>We have no natural enemies, many of us find no ways to spend the adrenaline that our bodies create, and very few of us have been taught from the childhood to understand our aggressive tendencies, or to deal with them.<br/><br/>Even worse, the society actively encourages to push it down and act like it's not there. No wonder there's a lot of pent-up anger not obedient to reasoning, always looking for the safe target to shoot at and get at least a moment of relief.<br/><br/>And being in the vicious circle of it, or personally inclined to attach to it and identify yourself through it, one can't hope for it to just go away. It's one of the biggest problem of the modern society, really, and high time someone showed that on screen.<br/><br/>Writer-director Martin McDonagh has previously entertained us with 2008's ""In Bruges"" and 2012's ""Seven Psychopaths"", both mixing action, drama and comedy, both original and pretty, pretty good.<br/><br/>But ""Ebbing"" is his magnum opus, which makes a lot of people wish a lot more of works from him, surely.<br/><br/>I tend to write my reviews as soon as possible after watching a movie. Not so with ""Ebbing"". I just couldn't write it asap. I had to let it all set, and get used to the idea that my words will never meaningly convey how good it actually is.<br/><br/>I also needed a bit of time to get used to the idea that 2017's best movie might not be neither the mighty ""Loveless"" nor near-perfect ""Call Me by Your Name"", both of which I love dearly, but this delicious little nut of a entertainment. All hail McDonagh and his awesome gang!<br/><br/>""Ebbing"" has already gathered 164 movie award nominations including 75 wins.<br/><br/>It recently got Golden Globes for best drama, screenplay, actress in drama (McDormand), and supporting actor (Rockwell). It's been also nominated for 7 Oscars, including movie, screenplay, McDormand as an actress, and two supporting actors (both Harrelson and Rockwell).<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that come March, the Academy will not pussy out of awarding this magnificent, sensational, powerhouse of a movie at least for those five categories mentioned above.<br/><br/>Yes, it has difficult, controversial topics, violence, and extremely dirty language, but who the hell cares if the result is so good?"

","Much credit goes to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Its analysis on a small town's skewed priorities on law and order feels inspired by the United States' many cultures, especially from the perspective of Mildred, played by Oscar winner Frances McDormand (Fargo). She never says a single kind word to anyone, but her true personality blooms once she routinely plants flowers in front of her blood-red billboards as if at the Vietnam memorial. Once there, she shares a melodic conversation with a deer beside the highway, keeping her human. The rest of Ebbing, Missouri also seems given up on America's growth, set instead to let desires run on dunking others beneath self-worth.<br/><br/>Though be warned: the three steps to the feature's creation appears a tad too rushed. The pre-production process mentions the Catholic church of the town exactly once in the first act, missing out on its powerful potential to serve a stronger MacGuffin to the story beyond just its hindrance to society. The production process's cheap burn makeup effects look poor compared to the wounds put on Leonardo DiCaprio's bear wounds. The post-production process disrupts its own narrative flow by throwing a flashback into a moment when dialogue would have sufficed.<br/><br/>Looking at the Oscar's past Best Picture winners, Spotlight and Moonlight, they both kept a consistent visual style, unlike Three Billboards. Primarily, the editor, Jon Gregory (Four Weddings and a Funeral, In Bruges) was a poor choice to put together the feature; a potential Oscar contender ought to require someone more experienced to present a population of human beings turned into thoughtless advertisements. Likewise, cinematographer Ben Davis (Guardians of the Galaxy) resorts to unnecessarily pointing the Steadicam upwards. If treated like a mockumentary similar to This Is Spinal Tap, then a greater impact could linger in this movie's legacy.<br/><br/>Now with the problems out of the way, basically everything else in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri accomplishes its civic duty.<br/><br/>Obviously, cops nowadays are no State Farm, so here their portrayal gets treated positively. Mildred's middle-class family home in particular takes no breather: her ex-husband continues to abuse her while her last shared memory with her murdered daughter reeks in high regret. Maybe the people here were born with it, maybe the pressure to advertise caused everyone to become whatever social message they always talk about. Its timelessness in leaving the precise year vague adds the extra snap, crackle, and pop to the core theme.<br/><br/>My commemorations go to the finger lickin' good performances by the whole cast, every single one proves the power of an ensemble, particularly the underrated actor Caleb Landry Jones (Breaking Bad, Get Out). Yet Sam Rockwell in particular is after an Academy Award nomination, and understandably so: his performance turns agitated one minute and collapsing in silent tears the next.<br/><br/>I appreciate how Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri knew not to excessively milk its timeliness right after it calls the cops a ""N*gger Torturing Business,"" since they lack concentration on actual crimes. Although these cops prefer the equally undignified term ""Persons of Color;"" even they the authorities think Black people fall short against ""normal"" White people. This mouth-gaping social relevance soon turns ironic once a new Black police sheriff comes into town.<br/><br/>Beyond the Blacks/Police conflict that challenges old stereotypes, jokes about people's weight and height keep going and going and going without crossing the line towards the offensive. The head of Ebbing's P.R. business even has the name Red, because everyone else around him sees red—both literally and figuratively!<br/><br/>It's a greatly clever style of writing which helps you to think different in a harsh way. We all want and need to preach about what makes us pound our fist on the table, and as depicted here, our abuse of our First Amendment rights turns us into our branding, erasing the definition between our wants and our needs. It really boils down to: Where do you want to go today?"

","2017 has been a banner year for movies, from Dunkirk to the outré ""mother!"" to this movie to...Oscar voters will have their work cut out for them. ""Three Billboards..."" should get a nod for Best Picture, Best Actor (MacDormand), Best Supporting Actor (Sam Rockwell) and so on. Enough about the awards though, this film simply delivers.<br/><br/>It delivers a gut punch from the moment you empathize with Mildred (MacDormand) and her unending grief over losing her daughter in a heinous manner and the local constabulary's inability (or is it unwillingness?) to solve the case. Ebbing is a small town, everyone is comfortable. The deputy, played to an intolerant ""T"" by Sam Rockwell, throws his weight around and no one says much because the police has an overlarge presence here. Mildred rents three signs outside an access road to town with provocative slogans, one of them calling attention to the crime, the others aiming full-force at Sheriff Willoughby (Harrelson). Willoughby is dying of cancer, and the town rallies around him, rather than the angry and grieving mother. This division sets the stage for some great repartee, as Mildred takes everyone down, from the sheriff to the town pastor to the deputy to various locals.<br/><br/>We come to a moment where closure might be expected, but instead it's just another loose end that gets pursued by Mildred and the deputy. ""Three Billboards"" drowns us in pathos, chokes us in anger and helps us understands the dynamics of small town America. See it now before the buzz creates lineups."
"silverturquoise","10","3","9","24 November 2017"," Before there were tweets, there were billboards
","I'm not sure where the seed for this gem of a story originated, but I can't help but wonder if the three billboards so central to the plot were inspired by the modern catharsis we see pouring out on a daily basis on social media. Before social media, you needed to put your message on billboards to really put yourself relentlessly out there in people's faces. The movie has all the essential elements - a flawlessly written tale, award-worthy acting, and beautiful cinematography and editing. It is both eccentrically funny and tragically sad at the same time, but manages to make so many philosophical points about crime, justice, bigotry, hypocrisy, ignorance, death, and grief. Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson create three larger-than-billboard characters whose lives become angrily and hilariously entangled over an unsolved murder. Frances McDormand's Mildred is astonishing, from the tender moments in the car imagining the billboards, to her smoldering conversation with the parish priest (best.thing.ever), to her guilt-ridden reminiscence of her last hours with her daughter. A brilliant film not to be missed."

","Just re-watched Fargo yesterday night, and this movie, 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, somehow popped in my thoughts before going to sleep. I saw this movie 14 months ago, but suddenly remembered the movie's similarities to the masterpiece I just re-watched: Frances McDormand as the lead; taking place in a small American town; crime/comedy type movie; and, well I guess the similarities end there. 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was a massive disappointment, so much so that it still manages to haunt me after all these months. That's why I decided to write this long-overdue review, like cleaning out the dark, dusty corner of my shed.<br/><br/>It's been 14 months, so I forgot some details about this movie, and, I will not re-watch it for the sake of this amateur review. (Who in 2019 has the time to re-watch a bad movie?) Aside from that, I also didn't see parts of the movie because I couldn't take it and had to leave mid-way. In other words-I'm about to review a movie that I saw 14 months ago and left halfway. However I will assure you that this movie had a lasting impression on me. A lasting impression that's characteristic of mediocre movies which had no match against their predecessors, and that were praised nonetheless (the last of this series for me was Interstellar). These movies anger me in several degrees. During the last 14 months, I have seen a couple of people, including a screenwriter, who said good things about this movie and now I don't trust their taste.<br/><br/>The plot driving element of 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was, well, the three billboards, which I heard was inspired by an actual encounter by the director when he was driving around the southern states. Ultimately this element doesn't really work to drive the plot-it's just there. I remember there was a minor reveal about a quarter into the movie, where the 3rd billboard is finally open to the audience, and it had something predictable written on it. The reveal fell flat and felt unnecessary. Why didn't they just show it in the beginning, and let it pass, like they did with the Paul Bunyan statue in Fargo? The Paul Bunyan statue worked so well not just because of its bizarre imagery, but because it is a subtle yet faithful symbol of the whole story. 3 Billboards slaps this blunt symbol across the viewers' face, and the characters keep talking about it as if they're rubbing it into our conscience so not to forget.<br/><br/>All characters were one-dimensional, lacked emotion, and did not feel real. An overused sentence in film criticism for sure, but it applies 100% to this movie. I couldn't contain my laughter when Woody Harrelson was narrating his character's suicide note, because it was bad, real bad, yet impressive how they managed to get such a wooden performance from a well-known distinguished actor. Why did the dude kill himself anyway? I remember the reasoning behind it was not convincing as well, but I would rather not waste my time remembering petty details of this movie.<br/><br/>It's obvious that this movie was aiming for ""Fargo with a modern touch."" By modern touch, the director wanted to incorporate things that were hot in 2017 like diversity and feminism, which I guess Fargo lacks in that context. But, does incorporating ideologies like diversity and feminism make a film better? Does it heighten the experience? I don't think so. Shakespeare wasn't remembered for his ideologies; he was remembered for writing timeless stories that continues to be read over generations. If Fargo is Shakespeare, then 3 Billboards is a dime novel.<br/><br/>3 Billboards is a mediocre movie that covers itself in unnecessary abstractions that seasoned film-goers will see right through. If you think this movie was any good, you haven't seen good movies. Watch any of the Coen brothers' movie for a start. Watch Fargo if you want to see my point I wrote here. And that's it for this sloppy review.<br/><br/>Edit: Just noticed that this movie is rated higher than Fargo. How??? It boggles my mind. Internet ratings is a farce."

The only people that seem to have a bit of decency and common sense are the 3 black people in the movie. This is Hollywood's way of getting back at the Midwest for not falling in line with their ultra liberal ideals. <br/><br/>When the movie started I thought the terrain didn't look like any I have seen in Missouri and realized it was filmed in North Carolina.

","Martin McDonaugh once again shows that he has such a fresh voice, and an incredible talent for writing and directing. Like in his previous two films, McDonaugh tackles really heavy subjects in a darkly comical way, but the humor and the drama never get in the way of each other. One moment you are gut-busting laughing about a really offensive remark that one person just made, only to feel tears well up the very next moment, because the joke has led to something profoundly beautiful and sincere. It is this balance, and the utterly unpredictable turn of events that transpire in every act of the story, what makes Three Billboards a true masterpiece. Fans of the director will see several themes (midgets, anyone?) as well as actors from previous efforts return, and they are all worthy of all the praise they have been getting. Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson should all be winning awards this season, but especially that truly bold and original script, which insists on being wildly offensive to people of every gender and every race, but at the same time never seems to really judge or call out anyone in particular, is something every screenwriter should aspire to make one day. Every single moving piece in this film has a point and purpose, and there is barely a thing that does not work. It is one of my favorites in years; this is the very reason I love film. Do not watch a trailer or read anything else about its contents, just go in blind and make up your own mind. You will never see anything quite like it."

","This film won Academy Awards for Frances McDormand (Mildred Hayes) and Sam Rockwell (Dixon) and rightfully so. Woody Harrelson won an Academy Award nomination too. The film is carefully constructed with rich character development of the three leads. Frances McDormand is a force to be reckon with any role and she is here too. Peter Dinklage and Clarke Peters have supporting roles too. The film is really a realistic portrait of a small American town. I'm not crazy about the open ending part of the film but you do understand Mildred and Dixon."

","This movie was by far the best picture of last year and it was robbed as far as we are concerned. I saw somewhere where it was due to a Hollywood thinking a racist turning out to be a good guy and I didn't think that way at all, I felt the movie was about acceptance and people's abilty to change their minds and learn it isn't all one way or the other. There were so many characters who you assumed one thing about but turned out to not be what you thought. The world could use more of that in this time in my opinion."

","Actually, I watched this movie mostly because of the good score it has. Unfortunately, I got very disappointed when the movie ended. I think this movie was made with just one think in mind: this is going to be unpredictable. I admit that they were successful about this, but at the cost of making very unrealistic plot. Yes! it was really shocking when I saw a woman kicking two school students just because they throw a can to her car's windshield, but I quickly remembered that this movie is doing everything possible to make you say: I didn't expect this to happen. So, at the end of the movie I find myself confused about everything, and even regretted the time I spent for watching it."

Woody the nice guy.. i felt bad they had to kill the character. But he did real good even after being dead. His character still lived to change & set the plot in the right direction. Now, Frances kept the movie alive. And that's not an exaggeration! She was the heart and soul of this plot. And she did real fine.

"The_Polish_Commoner","10","2","5","2 March 2018"," Great movie, the viewer is fully engaged and can't wait for what is to come next
","The acting in this movie is phenomenal. The main character, whose daughter is raped and killed, is phenomenal. Her life has lost meaning, she does not smile during the whole movie, and does not care about any legal repercussions of her actions. McDormand is absolutely believable in her actions and behavior. You just want to keep on watching.<br/><br/>The two main supporting actors, the Sheriff and Dixon. What a performance by them both. At first you actually have a sympathy for the sheriff. He seems like a good guy. He might not be able to solve the case but at least is showing some willingness. Maybe due to the billboards, maybe his inner devotion. Then we have the town idiot policeman Dixon. We hate him throughout the first part of the movie only to later find out that he's not such a bad guy, and my personal favorite character just because of the transition he went through. <br/><br/>As for the storyline/plot. The movie starts out really interesting, full-on. It does die down at times, but it never stops the viewer from wondering what is about to happen next. You just want to keep on watching. On the one hand it is an absolute drama about the loss of your child, probably the worst thing that can happen to a parent. On the other there are small pieces of comedy intertwined where you are really laughing aloud, maybe even livening up what is currently going on. You sit there really hoping that the murderer is caught, engaged in the plot. Plus the movie is not something extremely boring where the plot hasn't moved an inch over the first half an hour like in other best picture nominated movies. <br/><br/>I am not quick to really praise films, usually finding them boring or overrated, but this is a really good piece of work that I would really like to see again in the near future."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri tells the story of Mildred(Frances McDormand). Mildred's daughter Angela(Kathryn Newton), was brutally murdered but, the police couldn't find the assailant. Now, Mildred publicly challenges the cops, to find her daughter's murderer. <br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Martin McDonagh, has given us a completely original masterpiece. McDonagh gives us a perfect fusion of dark comedy & highly emotional moments. The background score by Carter Burwell, is excellent. The cinematography by Ben Davis, is gorgeous. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Frances McDormand gives the performance of a lifetime, as Mildred. McDormand effortlessly showcases various emotions that her character goes through, during the course of the film. Woody Harrelson is outstanding as Willoughby. Sam Rockwell is spectacular as Dixon. McDormand, Harrelson & Rockwell all deserve their Oscar nominations. Lucas Hedges is amazing as Robbie. Caleb Landry Jones is brilliant as Red Welby. Abbie Cornish is great as Anne. Zeljko Ivanek is impressive as the Desk Sergeant. John Hawkes is good as Charlie. Peter Dinklage is sensational as James. Samara Weaving is hilarious as Penelope. Kerry Condon, Sandy Martin, Darrell Britt-Gibson, Amanda Warren, Kathryn Newton, & Clarke Peters are awesome as, Pamela, Momma Dixon, Jerome, Denise, Angela & Abercrombie, respectively.

"scottduffus","7","2","5","8 February 2018"," Three swear words, I mean Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri
","In reviewing this movie I feel the need to declare that I grew up in a very caring family. My inability to relate to the family dynamics in this story may mean that my judgement of the character's intentions is somewhat clouded. Having made this disclaimer let's get down to the movie itself.<br/><br/>Having watched the trailer I imagined I would be watching a story about police incompetence and the justice sought by a grieving mother who had lost her daughter to a horrible crime. During the movie, that whole premise is turned on its head. Frances McDormand plays the victims mother, Mildred, who is frustrated that the local police have been unable to catch her daughters' killer. To stir up the community she has messages placed on three billboards near her home questioning why the police have not solved the crime. In the final message, she specifically mentions Chief Willoughby, Woody Harrelson, who is the respected Chief of Police. Coming to the defence of his boss is Deputy Dixon who comes across as red neck momma's boy played exceptionally by Sam Rockwell. This all leads to a lot of controversy and splits the community.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses any endearment I had for Mildred fades as she shows that she is willing to take actions that hurt others to achieve her objective. A flashback scene makes you wonder if she is taking this stand to obtain justice for her daughter or to appease her own guilt. Other interactions with both a sick Chief Willoughby and her son have me questioning whether Mildred's resentment of the world was a result of dealing with her child's death or was she always like that. For McDormand to take a character that should have us feel sympathy for her and make me dislike her so much shows her wonderful acting ability.<br/><br/>There are a number of unexpected twists and turns that allow Deputy Dixon to move on from his obnoxious small-town lawman role but don't expect miracles. Especially after you meet his disturbing mother, wonderfully played by Sandy Martin. The scene in the Dentist's surgery and Dixon's attack on Red Welby had me cringing in my seat and with the frequent use of every swear word that you can think of it is understandable why it has an MA rating. Just when you think that Mildred and Dixon may be on the road to redemption they make a decision that shows their true colours. While the film leaves you hanging, I am prepared to see the worst in these two characters and am sure they would have followed through.<br/><br/>Writer and Director, Martin McDonagh, has made a number of black comedies with many of this cast also appearing in his movie Seven Psychopaths.<br/><br/>I am giving this film 7 friends out of 10 due to its strong acting and the fact that there are a number of twists that keep you guessing about everyone's motives."

"justi00","9","2","5","30 January 2018"," Unpredictability is something rarely found in films
","Three Billboards is wonderfully unique in the way that it could change my mind about characters and expectations of the plot multiple times during the film. The audience is always guessing, never sure of where it will go next. It is better to go into this film and know as little as possible about its story so its twists and turns can have their full surprising impact. So it's your choice as to whether to even bother reading on. <br/><br/>Three billboards in short is the story of an angry bereaved mother who demands the attention of the local police through her provocative billboards. The story begins and wastes no time within the first ten minutes establishing Frances McDormand's character Mildred, the rape and murdered of her daughter and Mildred's outrage at local police's lack of action. Admittedly, I wondered how the next hour and forty-five minutes could be filled if it continued being so succinct. However, it morphs from black comedy, to emotional drama, to crime mystery so you're always wondering where the story will go next. Moreover, the film didn't stick to the perspective to one character adding to its unpredictability.<br/><br/>There was brilliant complexity in each of the characters. Audiences are shown many aspects of each of their lives. This gives the characters you would in any other film hate more depth forcing you to empathise and change your first opinions of them. There was real humanity in each person no fake perfection everyone was morally ambiguous. It is incredibly well cast but the stand out has to be McDormand's performance and the way she delivers her acidic retorts to anyone questioning Mildred's behaviour. She brings mostly fiery anger but is equally successful in giving glimpses of Mildred's sensitivity and pain. Sam Rockwell (Dixon) and Woody Harrelson (Willoughby) also give great performances because as a viewer you want to dislike them but you are made to soften towards them the more you find out. <br/><br/>It is astounding to me that this is only Martin McDonagh's third feature film he has directed himself. However, he was also the writer which I think was greatly beneficial as he knew best how to direct the cast with his own script resulting in artful performances. The dialogue in this movie can be angry, witty, clever and very human. Of course, any viewer would never forget Mildred's shocking but hilarious speech to a priest leaving him lost for words. A real highlight. <br/><br/>To write any more would be to spoil such a rare example of an unpredictable film. My concluding thoughts on the film were the overarching messages. I felt what came through very clearly was the theme of anger and how no character's life was in any way improved through acts of anger. No character won or ended up in a better situation than any other. The whole film was entirely ambiguous and left open for the audience to ponder upon. Nothing was neatly tied up or resolved."

Second fIlm of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. After her daughter is raped and murdered and there have been no suspects arrested Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) takes the bold step of renting three billboards and publicly asking the police chief why! This film should have been depressing given the subject matter, and in parts it was sad, poignant and moving, but it was also a very funny film. This was due largely to Frances McDormand, who is very skilled in her craft, Woody Harrelson who brings good leadership and great compassion to the role of the Police Chief and Sam Rockwell who produced an amazing piece of acting to give us the character of Jason Dixon, a man who should never have graduated the Police Academy. I enjoyed this from the very moment it began until the very moment it finished and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone who wants to see some good film making, undertaken by good actors, performing a good story."
"msbreviews","9","2","5","29 January 2018"," Rating: A
","The movie with the biggest title of 2017 (I think?!) tells the story of how Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) handles her daughter's murder, which still does not have any suspect after several months. She pays for three billboards with a clear message to the chief of Ebbing's police, William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson).<br/><br/>Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a violence-driven officer and close friend of William, join the fight against Mildred and a very dark comic drama unfolds.<br/><br/>One of the films I am only now getting the chance to watch due to its late Portugal's release and it is also one of the few movies I still have some big expectations for it to be part of my list featuring the best films of 2017 ... Well, I can spoil you right away: it is definitely part of my top10! You can check my updated list here!<br/><br/>I will start with what I think is the movie's strongest point: its screenplay. Martin McDonagh exceptionally elevates the story and flawlessly balances the film's several tones, from very dark mysterious drama to simple comedy. I mean, this movie really has everything: drama, comedy, mystery, extremely shocking scenes, suspenseful dialogues, incredible character development and plot twists that kept me constantly focused on the screen. It is superbly written, it has no crappy exposition scenes and it offers something to the viewer that films rarely do: doubt.<br/><br/>I can't possibly count the moments where I switched in favor of a character instead of another. The storytelling is really thought-provoking and I both supported and repressed every single character's actions at some period during the movie. This film causes uncertainty in relation to who should I support? Who belongs to the ""good side"" and the ""bad side"" of this whole thing? Everyone's point of view has reasons to be more than understandable, every character is amazingly well-developed and every scene is filled with so much tension and suspense, but also with a lot of heartfelt and compelling moments.<br/><br/>The story plays out like I never thought it would. There are so many minor plot twists, either related to a character or to the main script, that are utterly mind-blowing. They all make perfect sense, there is never a loose thread and every character's choices are justified with creative storytelling, which takes the movie to a whole other level. McDonagh also does a spectacular job as the director ...<br/><br/>Fantastic one-take scenes that raise the tension up a notch, a brilliant use of the realistic cinematography and an excellent use of some unusual camera angles. The editing is seamless, the pacing is handled to perfection without a single dull moment or a misplaced scene and the score is genuinely addictive. Furthermore, the feeling of watching two different films is never present due to the wonderfully balanced tone and for a movie with so much shocking drama, I left the theater with so many great laughs because the tonal shifts are perfectly executed.<br/><br/>Moving on to the cast, Frances McDormand, my God. How can someone be so badass? She is awesome! No wonder she is nominated for Best Actress at every award show, she clearly deserves it. A terrific performance with a range of expressions that go beyond most actors' capabilities, astonishingly well-balanced emotions (she goes through a lot of dramatic, comic and emotional scenes) that she nails in a McDormand-way.<br/><br/>Mildred Hayes is one of the most strong and powerful characters of 2017, period. She has to deal with so much and she stands her ground vigorously. In a way, she is a role model for every single person out there: if you believe you are doing the right thing, then do it and do not let anyone stand in your way or change your mind ... Just don't do some more aggressive stuff that she does, I don't think you would get away from some good jail time.<br/><br/>However, a few times she does become the ""villain"". She has no idea what other people are going through, but the movie always tries to justify her impulsive violent reactions with what she is suffering from. So, when the tables turn, she is also ""culpable"" (as she says in the film at some point) of both her and, for example, Bill Willoughby's actions, who is passionately interpreted by Woody Harrelson.<br/><br/>Harrelson has one of his best heartfelt and emotional performances ever. Bill's personal issues are the most shocking subplot of the movie and Woody handles his character's grounded yet funny personality in such a compelling way. Bill's choices lead to consequences that converge in an unconventional path and it is truly something that ultimately drives the movie to the remarkable story that it possesses.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell is also receiving a bunch of nominations and he undoubtedly works for those. Jason Dixon is the character that goes through more personality changes due to all of the bizarre things that happen in the story and it is very hard for an actor to start as one character and basically end with a totally different one. Rockwell embodies Dixon and completely transforms this character. Once again, the scripts are phenomenal (for every character), but the cast takes them and turns them into something special.<br/><br/>In case you are wondering, no. Peter Dinklage (James) is not in the film just to receive a pay-check. No one is. Every single character that is introduced into the story is very well-developed and they all have an important share of the runtime. Dinklage nails his performance, as well as Lucas Hedges (Robbie) and Caleb Landry Jones (Red Welby).<br/><br/>I only have a couple of minor issues with the film. Every act is strong on its own, each having their jaw-dropping moments. However, the third act finishes with an ending that I don't appreciate that much. I can't be detailed, but I don't think McDonagh had just one ending in his mind, I am just a bit disappointed that he chose this one, which is still a great ending!<br/><br/>My other issue has to do with the only character that simply does not fit in the movie's environment: Penelope (Samara Weaving). This character is not needed and it is so annoying. Her cliche stupid personality is the only element in the entire movie that simply does not make any sense. Fortunately, she is only on the screen for a few scenes. Weaving is not bad or good, she just suffers from the character she has to portray.<br/><br/>All in all, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is as amazing as the length of its title. Martin McDonagh produces a multi-genre, thought-provoking screenplay with excellent pacing and tone control. He is also brilliant as the director, using long takes and the realistic setting to its advantage, making the movie even better and still counting with a memorable score. All-star performances from Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell take the movie to a whole other level, but with an ending that is not as great as it could be plus an annoying character (Penelope) that thankfully does not share much of the screentime.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog!</li></ul>"
"kamykaza","9","2","5","28 January 2018"," Plot holes or intentional art at place?
","Reading some of the other user reviews I see a lot of people bothered with the plot holes. 
Let's take the cat out of the bag right a way, there are some major plot holes here. Most obvious the window scene (you'll know when you watch). 
Maybe the plot holes are intentional, to highlight just how crazy this world is, maybe not, depends on the perspective. <br/><br/>But you have to ask yourself the question. Is this really what you want to be thinking about in this movie? 
With so many greatly written characters, a story you care about and a believable world, this dark satiric drama comedy will make you think and feel. <br/><br/>At moment reminding me of Fargo, a moment of ""No country for old men"" but all the time staying completely original. 
A strong cast going all the way from the Baltimore Wire, to the lands of Westeros, with a police chief who comes of here even stronger then in True Detectives, and all the way back to the Fargo again with the leading role in Frances McDormand, this chemistry can be felt all the way. <br/><br/>In a day and time, where 2 dimensional movies like Shape of water get most nominations, and Plot-hole Wars Return of the Jedi gets 5, this is a move that deserves all the love it can get. <br/><br/>Watch it without prejudice and enjoy the best drama of Oscar 2018."
"jajact","9","2","5","28 January 2018"," McDonagh's recent ""tour de force""
","I must say, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" stroke by surprise the entire movie industry by earning the Best picture (Drama) recently at the 2018 Golden Globes Ceremony. This Coen-ish piece offers more than the soft dark comedy we are used too with McDonagh and it seems that he's being recognized for his ""homage"" to the famous Brothers. <br/><br/>What begins as a simple drama about a mother who lost her daugther, quickly becomes a fluid, realistic though impredictable masterpiece who inspire genuine emotions from star actors Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson. As passionnated and talented as each other, we must give credit to McDormand who plays the leading role as a grieving yet frustated mother. Seriously, what a bad-ass character! She litterally elevates McDonagh's movie with her authenticity and her intensity. It's really one of those movies who can make you laugh out loud and cry vigorously in a minute-intervall. Credit to Rockwell who offer almost a breakthrough performance for those who haven't seen ""Moon"" (2009) a couple years ago. In the same vein, Harrelson gives us a touch of his classic black-humour performance with his well-crafted character. S/O to the entertaining soundtrack which fits almost perfectly with scenes.<br/><br/>I believe ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is going to be a strong contender for the 2018 Oscars, especially in acting and writing categories. <br/><br/>A beautiful, well-acted though distorted piece you don't wanna miss this year!"

","I must start with saying that 2017 has been a bad year for movies.
Most didn't have character, a good plot, just nothing!
But then comes TBOEM. A gem which has got everything a movie should have. 
Right from the start it's funny and keeps you glued on to the screen, which certainly wasn't the case with any other I watched during 2017. 
It's not entirely a comedy, however. It's about this mother who lost her daughter to a rapist, and is struggling to come to terms with her child's death. She takes matters to her own hand when the Police has no clue on how to investigate the matter further.
The supporting roles absolutely nails it with their performance and compliments the main character even more.
There is absolutely so much more to this story than what meets the eye. 
All in all the best movie which came out in 2017. The only one, rather."
"valleyjohn","9","2","5","25 January 2018"," Put this on a Billboard - ""YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM"".
","If you are a movie fan this is the best time of year. It's awards season and all the best films are around so you can check out if the hype is justified. Three Billboards has been talked highly amongst the critics and in my opinion quite rightly so. It's the best film I have seen in quite a while.<br/><br/>It's the story of a grieving mother who takes matters into her own hands as she searches for her daughter's murderer. An angry Mildred Hayes erects three provocative highway signs to catch the eye of the town's well liked Chief of Police Bill Willoughby. Hoping the billboards spur Willoughby's officer Dixon into action but all it does is ignites a storm in the community as the police force evades charges of racism and corruption.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell is an underrated actor. He's done some fantastic work in recent years .I'm not sure why he doesn't get bigger roles.
There is no denying Frances McDormand ability too ( who can forget Fargo?). These two actors are absolutely fantastic in this film and I hope they both win in their respective categories . 
This film has everything. It's funny , it's sad , it can make you angry and it can makes you cry.

","Three Billboards is the sort of film that you wish you had stumbled upon by accident, which turns out to be a gem, which you can then urge other people to watch. However the annual awards hype around Three Billboards had just started to gather when I went with my partner to see the film. Yes it richly deserves praise but I also hope it is not over-exposed and over-analysed via the publicity of the Oscars.<br/><br/>Anyway we both thoroughly enjoyed it - the story is fresh and the script is superbly written and acted. It is a wonderful study of characters, emotions and consequences with all the actors, particularly McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson, at the top of their game. The behaviour and dialogue manage to hold a fine line between being shocking yet hilarious, while maintaining the gravity of the underlying story.
I hope it's a great surprise for you too !"
"chestern-80136","9","2","5","23 January 2018"," A genuinely brilliant movie, with very few slipups.
","Following my viewing of the Golden Globes, and more recently, the SAG awards, I decided that watching Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri would most likely be a good idea. The film has performed exceptionally well so far this awards season, consistently winning many of the awards it was put up for. After being fortunate enough to see it, I can understand why.<br/><br/>I feel it is worth quickly adding that, while watching this film, I was quite tired. I'd seen Coco earlier that same day, and I rarely go out for that long a period. The fact that the film still made such an impact on me in that state is impressive.<br/><br/>Ordinarily, this isn't the sort of film I'd be attracted to. I didn't really recognise many of the actors going in, nor was it based on an existing property. To put it bluntly, it was a proper, standalone film. After seeing it, I was genuinely impressed.<br/><br/>Ordinarily, I would list highlights of a film, then delve into the issues. Now, however, I'm perplexed; the film did everything well, at least to an extent. There was only a few things I found issue with. The CGI (which was used incredibly sparingly) was often rather jarring. It didn't fit with the rest of the gorgeously shot world. Though the locations are never astounding, Ben Davis makes even relatively mundane countryside look beautiful.<br/><br/>The characters shown within this film are rather fascinating. The events leading up to the film could almost be a film in themselves. Despite what reading a synopsis may imply, however, this film isn't a murder mystery. The murder of Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand)'s daughter isn't the focal point of the film. Instead, the main focus of the film is how the event impacts various people, and how they go on to deal with it. Each main character is rather layered, and could arguably be the lead in their own film.<br/><br/>Bringing these characters to life is a brilliantly talented cast. Frances McDormand deserves each award she receives. I feel the trailer actually does her character a disservice; after watching it, I felt that she was simply a vulgar, hateful woman taking her frustrations out on those around her. In reality, she's a far more sympathetic character, who isn't nearly as abrasive as the trailer makes her out to be. Woody Harrelson's Chief Willoughby was probably my favourite character of the film, who, despite playing the straight man in many scenes, is able to bring levity and humour to the dark situations in which he finds himself. Sam Rockwell's Dixon is also wonderful, though many people have taken issue with his character's arc. Personally, I enjoyed it greatly, though it's something to note.<br/><br/>Many of the supporting characters are hit or miss. I feel Peter Dinklage was brilliantly funny, though some of the others failed to steal a chuckle from me. The rest of the audience seemed to enjoy them, however, so it's most likely a fault of my own.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by how violent this film is; the trailer makes it seem that violence is a punchline to a joke, but at times, the movie is genuinely brutal. It's probably more violent than most modern horror films.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was actually rather enjoyable. The original scoring was great, and fit the setting perfectly. The other songs added each served their purpose, oftentimes accentuating the comedy within a scene.<br/><br/>For the most part, I found the writing great. The characters spoke like real (if dramatised) people, though occasionally there was some odd lines.<br/><br/>To conclude the review, I feel this was a truly impressive film, and I understand why it's getting so many nominations. If you love film, I must recommend you give this one a watch. Thankfully, this isn't one you need to see in the cinema; I think it could work just as well on a smaller screen. If you need a concrete ending, however, you may need to steer clear; it's rather open ended. I feel Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri deserves a 9/10, and I look forward to seeing more films of a similar quality to this one."

"dromasca","9","2","5","22 January 2018"," life and anger in deep America
","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is positioning itself as the main favourite of the Academy Awards season, and if it will win some of the statuettes in the major categories it will be by merit. It is quite interesting that an Irish - British director succeeded to make such a sharp film about the territory that we know so little especially out of the US - the deep America, the one far of the glamour of the big cities or the sparks of high-tech. We should not be amazed however, as Martin McDonagh is a very special kind of artist, a playwright of great talent who has gradually broadened the scope of his plays from the Irish history and political present to British realities, and later to more broader human topics. As a film director he started with a short film set in Ireland that won an Academy Award in 2006, while his next two feature films are set in Europe (In Bruges) and Hollywood (Seven Psychopaths). The story in 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' takes place in the heart of America, I would almost say to the bleeding heart of the country, as the small city in Missouri can be seen as a micro-model of the complex realities of the US, with its prejudice and violence, but also with the humanity and power to heal of its people. The quality of the film making places it somewhere in-between or in the same league as the films of the Coen brothers and of Tarantino.<br/><br/>Mildred ( Frances McDormand ) is a hard working woman, divorced and living from a gift shop in a place not many tourists come to visit. When her teen-aged daughter is attacked, raped and killed she feels guilt at the thoughts that she could have prevented her death and anger at what seems to be foot-dragging from the local police force led by sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). She turns her anger into action by posting bug announces on advertising billboards on a side road, but in short time her actions will put her in conflict with the rest of the community.<br/><br/>There are many levels that the development of this story can be understood. People like Mildred (and not only her) are angry, and anger needs to be channeled into action. Does this action need to be violent? Does violence ever pay? Maybe this is one of the roots of the higher level of conflict and polarisation that we detect when we observe the American society in general and small communities like the one described in the movie in particular. Then, in true life, nobody is a perfect saint and nobody is pure evil either. The sheriff is terminally sick which makes the whole community to side with him in his conflict with Mildred, and maybe his inaction is only apparent, maybe there are crimes which cannot be really solved but by chance. Life is not as presented in the 'CSI' TV series (although a CSI element does appear in the story!). Mildred's actions seem all justified but do they have the effect that she desires, do they bring peace of mind, and especially do they bring closer the solution of the crime that took her daughter away? Can redemption be achieved by taking the law in your own hands or by punishing the committer of another crime?<br/><br/>The script succeeds to bring to surface the characters and the environment they live in. Acting is superb. Frances McDormand makes us forget all those discussions about the lack of strong feminine lead roles in Hollywood and she may be on her way to a deserved second Academy Award. He words, her looks, her silences are just to the mark. I liked her performance here more that Meryl Streep's one in 'The Post'. Woody Harrelson provides another strong performance, but the real great surprise is Sam Rockwell whose nuanced interpretation of the role of Dixon (the sheriff's aid) was complex and subtle and succeeded to overcome one of the few weak points of the script, the change of perspective of his character.<br/><br/>'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the best thing that I have seen until now in this pre-Academy Awards season. It makes the viewers immerse in the reality of the place it describes, it makes them think about the humanity that exists in each of us, about the need to act and the need to find peace of soul, about justice and vengeance and the difference between the two concepts. As with many good films its story and characters continue to be with us long time after the screening ends."
"pkollmeier","5","2","5","22 January 2018"," This One Didn't Quite Catch Me
","Where do I begin?<br/><br/>First and foremost, Three Billboards is a fiery movie. Frances McDormand is, as always, superb. But, can a superb actress fix a sub-par film? As the movie begins, I really enjoyed it. It seemed like it was really heading somewhere. However, as time wore on, my opinions changed and I had no idea what this movie was attempting to say. It was also very difficult to feel any connection with McDormand's character and her daughter or son. One flashback the entire film? Strange choice.<br/><br/>Second, there are some crazy weird scenes in this that don't quite hold up, or make any sense at all. A cop throwing a man out of a window, punching him in the face in the middle of the street and no one (not even the officer assigned to take over the Sheriff's duties) does a damn thing? I get it. It's trying to make a point. And, we've seen some crazy things in our days and times way before our generation. But, this one just didn't do it for me. I thought it was forced. Shocking. Then, things got even weirder after this.<br/><br/>Rockwell is fired by the new Sheriff in town for his behavior. Due to the beloved Sheriff's suicide and his note to Rockwell about being a 'good man' (are we sure about this?) deep down, he needs to get his act together. As a flaming mazel tov cocktail nearly blows him to pieces, Rockwell runs through the flames (symbolism?) and is suddenly this changed man. Maybe, but again, it didn't seem very realistic to me. When the film ends, I remember sitting at my girlfriend's house and saying aloud ""what in the *expletive*?"" <br/><br/>I'm all for indie films. I'm all for different ways to tell stories. I'm all for innovation and experimentation. But, is this film really as good as so many critics said it was? Art is subjective and I want to make my own movies some day, but I just don't see it. Maybe that's the beauty of it but I'm sticking with my 5/10 and telling you to skip this one. It's just not a very good movie."
"blundellisgod","9","2","5","21 January 2018"," A meditation on pain, anger and three billboards
","British writer/director Martin McDonagh caused a sensation with the release of his explosively brilliant debut film In Bruges and while the underrated Seven Psychopaths flew under the radar a little, expectations were still high for his latest effort, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. That title might appear a little clunky but it is those titular billboards that act as a catalyst for everything that happens within the film.<br/><br/>Haunted by grief and fuelled by a dull rage, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) hires three billboards to express her disgust that the local police force have failed to catch her daughters murderer. Police Chief William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) is the main source of her ire and the situation isn't helped by his right hand man Dixon (Sam Rockwell), a violent racist with psychopathic tendencies. The erecting of the billboards has a domino effect that takes this story to a myriad of surprising places. McDonagh is not afraid to rip up the rule book half way through and while this can be jarring, it means that Three Billboards is a film that demands your attention.<br/><br/>The cast are quite simply a tour de force. McDormand is terrifying but vulnerable as Mildred and Sam Rockwell channels everything he has got to somehow make himself unlikable. No mean feat for one of the most charismatic actors in Hollywood. Woody Harrelson is more measured in his performance but just as effective and the three of them together share an electric chemistry.<br/><br/>McDonagh has always demanded a suspension of disbelief in his films and the violence here threatens to stray into the category of cartoonish but he mostly succeeds in crafting a tale that takes the best of Tarantino and the Coen Brothers to produce something fresh and compelling. McDonagh showed on In Bruges that you can combine comedy with real drama if you have the skill to do so and while the comedic elements are toned down in Three Billboards, there were still moments that made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Three Billboards is a film about blurred lines. Lines between sanity and loss of control, lines between good and bad, lines between life and death. Not everybody is all evil and not everybody is all good. By presenting a tableau of morally ambiguous characters coping with grief and pain, McDonagh has produced the best film of his career to date."
"PipAndSqueak","9","2","5","20 January 2018"," Trio of red hoardings with effing
","You are warned at the beginning about the bad language and violence in this film. The language makes for a very realistic portrayal of small town life in the back of beyond. The violence will take you by surprise, even when you correctly predict what is about to happen. This is quite a feat and worthy of credit for the achievement. McDormand provides a thoughtfully expressed depiction of the kind of disenchanted, sad, mad and determined woman the murder victim's mother could likely be in such a real life situation like her character's. She nails it throughout, never missing a beat. There are amusing interludes sprinkled throughout...and completely necessary to keep us believing the story. It is indeed an interesting story but it does terminate a couple of scenes too early. Mildred does not realise she is going to confront the man who threatened her in her shop, her ex police dept buddy doesn't know she's met the man he suspects is involved in murdering Mildred's daughter. We don't get to see either. I expect a sequel at the very least!"

But in this case the trailer doesn't do it justice at all.
Too much emphasis is put on the humor.
And yes it's present in the film but it's not a comedy.
Even with the serious subject of rape/murder as a given, the trailer fooled me into
thinking they made an upbeat, light movie about it.
It's not, it's pretty heavy.
Don't get me wrong, this is not a warning.
In fact it's the opposite.
I almost didn't watch it based on the trailer being too 'feelgood' for the subject and would lack substance.

","""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is promoted as a ""black comedy crime film,"" but the truth is that it's a modern parable about revenge and the only thing funny about it is the sad irony of what can happen by giving in to this most basic of human inclinations, no matter how apparently justified. <br/><br/>Martin McDonagh, who wrote, produced and directed the film, reportedly was inspired after seeing billboards about an unsolved crime while traveling ""somewhere down in the Georgia, Florida, Alabama corner.""<br/><br/>The film is fictional, but the script and the performances ring as true and as realistic as something that might happen in today's world in any town in America.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand plays Mildred Hayes, a bitterly divorced mother still aching over the unsolved rape and murder of her teenage daughter, Angela, seven months before. <br/><br/>Furious over what she perceives as foot-dragging on the case, she empties her bank account to pay for three billboards just outside of town. They read, successively: ""RAPED WHILE DYING,"" ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS?"", and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?""<br/><br/>Townspeople are upset over the billboards, but none as much as Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), whose profane good-old-boy manner belies a complex human being, a doting husband and father at home who is a savvy, tough-as-nails peace officer on the job. He's also dying of pancreatic cancer.<br/><br/>Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's plight, explaining the legal constraints he is under, but she will have none of it and refuses to remove the signs. As a result, she and her son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges, so effective in ""Manchester By the Sea"") face all sorts of harassment by the townspeople, including that by Mildred's abusive ex-husband, Charlie (John Hawkes), an ex-cop living with a dim but well-meaning 19-year-old Penelope (Samara Weaving), who offers perhaps the most accurate summation of the story with a phrase that she said she read on a bookmark.<br/><br/>In the midst of all of this is Deputy Sheriff Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), an ignorant racist who never seems to understand exactly what is happening but overreacts in very much the wrong way to that which he does.<br/><br/>To reveal any more would give away the many surprising twists both in plot and character development.<br/><br/>The film is meticulously thought out and though timeless in its point, is particularly applicable to today's society in which all too many people act out their emotions in a violent way, horrible consequences notwithstanding.<br/><br/>The casting and performances are nigh-on perfect, top to bottom, with McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell especially stunning.<br/><br/>""Three Billboards"" is Oscar-worthy across the board, and would stack up against any best picture nominee, past or present."

"mt-95256","9","2","5","16 January 2018"," Five Stars for Three Billboards; Dark, Gritty, Funny, Thought-provoking
","TL;DR
<ul><li>An instant classic</li></ul>-Bleak, depressing but always hilarious in only the way McDonagh can be
-Excellent script from McDonagh
-Relevant, engaging story told at a perfect pace
-Incredible performances from an A* cast
-One of cinema's greatest cliffhanger endings
----------------------------<br/><br/>Take one look at the list of nominations this awards season and you'll see a long list of excellent films, but there's one with a strange title that stands out - Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Not the sort of catchy title that studios often look out for, but writer-director Martin McDonagh is anything but ordinary, something this film certainly proves. In fact it's fortunate that the awards have picked this film up, since otherwise a film like this could have been lost. Instead, the awards buzz have given Three Billboards a certain hype. Combine that with the reputation McDonagh has gained from such excellent films as In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths (the former in particular being an all-time favourite of mine), does this film live up to the excitement? Absolutely yes. An incredible film with perfect performances and a first-class screenplay, McDonagh has given us a refreshing classic that's sure to be lauded over for years to come.<br/><br/>Strange as the story may seem, it's oddly captivating and by no means ever boring. Despite Mildred being the protagonist, we don't necessarily just take her side as the story encompasses a range of characters in the town; we see as much of Mildred as we do aggressive cop Dixon. The story really succeeds in challenging the audience's perspective and expectations. It doesn't require a big, Hollywood-style plot; instead it's small and intimate and is all the stronger for it. This allows for a more thorough and detailed look at the characters and the effects the story has on them, making it the sort of film we need today, particularly with countless stories of sexual harassment and racial attacks we hear in the news. It's a film with a story that implicitly challenges us to question our society and helps us perhaps to see some things in a new light. Add to that the best cliffhanger ending since The Italian Job (1969) and you have a story which sticks firmly in your mind.<br/><br/>Similar to In Bruges, another pro of its small story is that it allows the script to stand out, something very important in a McDonagh film. One of my favourite contemporary writers (his play The Pillowman is one of my absolute favourite plays), Three Billboards' script is perfectly exemplary of McDonagh's type of writing; bleak and depressing, but with plenty of dark humour peppered throughout, all the while thought provoking and challenging. More than this, his way of writing allows for strangely beautiful language, where profanity is just part of the poetry. The script is particularly good at balancing tension with constant comedy; you could be on the edge of your seat, waiting for something bad to happen, while laughing the entire time. It's a strange sense of unease that you bizarrely can't fail to enjoy.<br/><br/>As big a fan as I am of McDonagh, however, he can't take all the credit. The casting is first-class and each cast member is excellent. Presumably McDonagh's got a thing for 'little people' since Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage takes over midget/dwarf duties, as opposed to Jordan Prentice's disgruntled actor in In Bruges. While not particularly important to the overall story, Dinklage's character's inclusion adds a nice bit of variety to the town's population and it's nice to see him play the opposite of Tyrion Lannister - mostly sober and a bit less successful with women. Still, he seemed a bit underused for such a successful actor at the moment. Abbie Cornish's Anne also doesn't seem to be given the screentime she deserves, but when her character's married to Harrelson's Willoughby, she's always going to be dwarfed by him. Harrelson is once again effortlessly likeable and 'cool' as the town's police chief, not becoming the antagonist you'd expect him to be. On the contrary, while you'd think we'd be on Mildred's side for the entire film, instead we find ourselves almost sympathising with Chief Willoughby more. Harrelson does an excellent job of balancing emotion and humour. Rockwell's Dixon is more arguably the 'antagonist' of the film if you need to apply the label somewhere, who again balances the humour in his character very well with his aggression and stupidity. He could easily have been a very detestable character, but Rockwell's portrayal is so charismatic and he progresses throughout the film's entirety to the point that our opinions and perceptions change. At the heart of the whole drama though, stony-faced and angry, is McDormand's Mildred. Playing fierce and fiery wonderfully, McDormand is the one who really sells the film and it's her character's personality that carries the film just as much as the script.<br/><br/>If you liked In Bruges, you'd certainly like this. If you like any film with wit and comedy, you'd like this. If you like films set in a microcosm which question and reflect on our own society, you'd like this. The only problem is that there's a shame there weren't five billboards to make a five-star pun... McDonagh solidifies his talent with his third consecutive great film, this one being his best yet. With an incredible script and a perfect cast, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is an instant classic, able to challenge an audience and make them laugh the whole time."

"bokbokwhoosh","10","2","5","14 January 2018"," An epic in the guise of a dark comedy
","Epic films come in two flavours: one, the obvious, where the narrative tries to capture a breadth of events, where Greek heroes and hamartia abound, where the rise and fall of some epic entity is captured; the second, where the narrative itself is focused on a microcosm, but the content pushes conceptual abstractness, dealing with questions and issues of epic proportions. Three Billboards belongs firmly in the second category; epic in scope, this film presses every major aesthetic button, leading you on to catharses - yes, in the plural - of different kinds.<br/><br/>While the film captures the admittedly unusual events in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, after a citizen decides to put up billboards criticizing the lack of action from their chief of police, the questions explored by the film are deeply philosophical. One can watch it just for the small-town narrative, and be amusingly piqued (or, like many other reviewers here, annoyed and offended), or one can hang on as the film takes you on a roller-coaster exploring notions of morality, duty, love, and justice that you had taken for granted. If you let the film penetrate you, you can expect to laugh, cry, think, and be deeply moved; and you might leave the hall as I did, disturbed, sad, angry, and yet, relieved, puzzled perhaps, and truly purged of emotions for a while.<br/><br/>If not for anything else, watch it for one heck of a female lead, one of the best I've seen on English screens, in a stellar performance by Frances McDormand."

With a mix of tension and laughs as per usual to McDonagh's previous work, Three Billboards thrives in its substance and characters, in a surprisingly sentimental story.<br/><br/>Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) wages her own war against her town's police department by putting up three billboards with direct messages to the police, after no progress or effort has been shown after Hayes' daughter Angela was raped and murder. Protesting her acts, Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) tries to keep the town from tearing itself apart from the indecorous billboards. But Hayes' real battle is with despicable Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). As the billboards stir the pleasant towns folk, Hayes gradually earns herself more enemies attracting more hate to her and her son.<br/><br/>Less thrill ride than Psychobaths but more dark passion as with In Bruges, McDonagh's latest achievement is a vigorous triumphant in story-telling. With a immense ensemble cast leading the way and a script as naturally articulated by the cast sets McDonagh's drama in its realist genuine setting.<br/><br/>McDomand bringing an astonishingly fierce performance as the grieving mother, shows more grit than her more cheerful detective from Fargo (1996). Every moment with Hayes is an emotional presence of anguish but also sorrow. McDormand thrives forcefully in a rough kick performance of aggression, fuelling the drive of the film. Especially shot in intense close ups, our attention is drawn to the intensity and emotion.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell also finally receives the recognition he deserves as a fantastic supporting role as the sluggish, racist Dixon whose demented life style is just as abroken as Hayes. Rockwell's familiar drunk charm and quirkiness serve him best in his latest performance for the antagonist. Dixon's odyssey in the film manifests in a timeless journey of redemption.<br/><br/>If you haven't learnt of McDonagh's genius as a writer, than Three Billboards is the hard cold evidence. One of the unique things that the trailer sadly misleads you on, is that although you may think this is quirky black comedy and it is, but still has really mournful heart in its centre subject matter. Continuing to tie in the accustomed biblical concepts and heaven and hell, Three Billboards is another formidable reflection of the soul.<br/><br/>McDonagh triumphantly brings out real humanity in this twisted drama. Its the small moments McDormand crying towards the camera are really heart-melting. The transition that McDonagh constructs for his characters are a fabulous force of spirit, rather encouraging at this point in time. Carter Burwell's soundtrack furthermore is an appropriate background, guiding the tale from start to finish, contributing to petite moments of sadness.<br/><br/>An exceptional mix of comedy, wow, and healing, Three Billboards is an unpredictable sorrowful story with an unforgettable presence of talent by the ensemble cast, but is maintained and victorious in its masterly story brought to life by McDonagh."
"coreyjdenford","10","2","5","12 January 2018"," Three Billboards, five star execution.
","This review of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is spoiler free<br/><br/>***** (5/5)<br/><br/>AFTER HIS OSCAR nominated debut In Bruges, British-Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh has gained a knack for his distinctive sensibilities as a filmmaker, his brilliant third endeavour Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a spectacular combination of his vulgar, politically incorrect, stupidly funny and unfathomably dark sense of humour. He's never too far away from the shockingly elements which tend to lead to awards-upsets. Here he hits pretty much the same notes as his predecessor Seven Psychopaths, except in many ways his latest has a far better - more interesting narrative behind it - he reliably never really falls back - in either his storytelling or his comedy antics. And the result is his most accomplished film of all time, but also it's one of the best and darkest comedies ever, and makes for one of the best films of all time. 
 
Frances McDormand gives a terrifying powerhouse performance as Mildred Hayes, a grieving single mother who is unable to come to terms that the local police haven't done anything about the death of her only daughter, seven months earlier. Living now with her son Robbie (a fantastic Lucas Hedges), she has an idea to post a message on the three billboards (outside Ebbing, Missouri - of course), the messages that she intends to print are legal, but also to angrily highlight the ineptitude of the local police force, one member in particular, the named Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). In a hope to call them out for making no arrests. Some including friends share their sympathy to her for getting justice, but others feel that her message is solely irresponsible, blankly pointing out the adored Chief Willoughby in short of making him look like a monster. These accusations hurt him. Yet nobody is as hurt as racist cop, Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who with his vicious demeanour and anger as a weapon does what he can to get revenge on Mildred trying to make her life a misery. 
 
Like In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths there's a lot going here, as the film often touches on the modern-day Western genre with his storytelling, McDonagh zigs around this small American town eloquently forming three brilliantly written intertwined narratives of three very different people, and he successfully zags through the rising tension of the townspeople who just want Mildred's fighting to cease. But full praise goes to McDormand, severely clad in dungarees, a bandana (an obvious reference to The Deer Hunter), complete with steel-toed boots and a devilish look in her eye. McDonagh has essentially turned her into a weapon of destruction and to be fair destruction is in her mind, and like a fiery gut punch her terrifying, yet brilliant performance will make your eyebrows singe (in a good way). 
 
Though anger is not the only element that works its way through here. Those familiar with McDonagh's work will see Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri as just another time to bring his darkly funny sense of humour to life - and you'd be right. But you'll be surprised to see that the film comes polished with warm beating heart one that pumps sympathy for its lead star and the other characters at work one that's both robustly drawn out and richly written and may even bring a tear to your eye. Unlike his brother John Michael McDonagh's War on Everyone, Martin has clearly made a triumphant move to America filled and filled it brilliant, masterful filmmaking, so much so that every moment here entrants in the purely distinctive American town life and landscape. And his clever mix in dark comedy, heartfelt drama and the blend of characters is like a Coen Brothers' film - and really, there's no higher compliment. 
 
VERDICT McDonagh's latest is a dizzying ride anchored by magnetic performances and virtuosic screenwriting it may be the latest in awards-upsets but it's certainly an entertaining and joyful one."
"cinema-32","9","2","5","10 January 2018"," mini review of #3Billboards
","Mini review of: 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing,Missouri<br/><br/>A strong contender for the Oscar, recent multiple winner at the Golden Globe Awards, Martin McDonagh's (In Bruges) little film with a long, awkward title is proving to have some legs.
A few critics have noted that the film by McDonagh, an Englishman, is somewhat tone deaf when it comes to portraying race relations in little town America. I disagree with that assessment particularly in view of the myriad shootings of unarmed black men by cops which have occured recently in the U.S. in little towns similar to Ebbing and bigger towns as well. Many of these same cops have not suffered any consequences for their actions. The film sticks pretty close to reality in that respect. Although no black individuals come to harm there is plenty of brutal, unwarranted, unjustifiable violence at the hands of a cop played with just the right amount of righteous stupidity by Sam Rockwell. 
The story is one of revenge and retribution. Frances McDormand, excellent in the role of mother Mildred Hayes ,blows what's left of her money on 3 vacant billboards accusing the Sherrif's department of laxity and incompetence in solving the rape and death of her daughter which occurred over a year ago.
These accusations will lead to a closer look at the ugly underbelly of small town America rife with racism, rage, stupidity and violence. It's not a stretch to suggest that it hits close to home on all those targets.
Woody Harrelson is very good as the Sheriff, he's not without compassion, sensitivity or humor. He also has a big secret which apparently the whole town knows about. Peter Dinklage has a small but memorable role. I wanted more of him. His dinner out with Mildred is priceless. The character played by Rockwell has a bit of an epiphany at the end which is not totally believable given the propensity of the character to act impulsively and without thinking but it does serve to tie the ending in an almost neat bow. My grade: A-"
"thinkMovies","9","2","5","10 January 2018"," Brilliantly sad
","Used to be, way back, billboards written and paid for by individuals might have read ""War is over, if you want it"" but these days these same billboards seem to yell ""We're lost and there's no hope"".<br/><br/>The acting in Three Billboards is phenomenal. Worth seeing the movie again and again to marvel at the craft of the actors lead by Frances McDormand. Truly a tour de force performance that reveals more nuance and perfection every time you watch it. Mildred must surely get an Oscar to bookend Marge Gunderson.<br/><br/>Photography is also very good, capturing the essence of the atmosphere. The Director seems inconsequential when the actors' craft and the photography reign above, making you forget you are watching a movie. Maybe that's my compliment to the Director.<br/><br/>But what is actually going on? What is the story? In the later part of the second decade of the 21st century, a vacant statement of a Dark Ages for the mind, the heart and the soul, of a humanity that's lost direction, purpose hope and sense of beauty.<br/><br/>Indeed, Mildred of Ebbing is Marge of Fargo, adjusted for a post 9-11 alienated and fearful society that aims for nothing, sees nothing and hopes for nothing to the point of drifting through life in a state of indecision and, well, clinical depression and disgust for other humans.<br/><br/>A brilliantly acted sad statement on what humanity has become."
"ginocox-206-336968","4","2","5","9 January 2018"," Incoherent political commentary mars stellar performance by Harrelson
","""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" offers a few laugh-out-loud moments, a nuanced performance by Woody Harrelson, some interesting plot reversals and unexpected developments. It's touted as a black comedy, but is not nearly as consistently amusing in its absurdity as ""Burn Before Reading,"" which also starred Frances McDormand and had a similar seriocomic tone. <br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the film tries to be relevant and political, touching on serious matters, such as spousal abuse, police brutality, unequal treatment of black suspects by police, vigilantism, political activism and other social issues. The cast is inclusive, with a sixty-year-old actress as the protagonist, blacks in two key roles, a dwarf and a character who may have repressed homosexual tendencies. It takes feminist digs at men who leave their wives for bimbos a third their age and seems to allude to some of the Obama-era consent agreements for police department oversight. It even has an extended scene that Snyder would term dog-petting, with a fawn. Frightfully relevant fare, but not particularly amusing. <br/><br/>To work all these diverse social issues into the story, the characters often behave in manners that make very little sense, if anybody stops to think about it. Unfortunately, the pace is a bit ponderous for much of the film and willful suspension of disbelief is routinely disrupted by excessive reliance on jiggly-cam shots, giving the audience ample opportunity to notice the incongruities. <br/><br/>The role that suffers the most is McDormand's Mildred, who sets out to right a grievous injustice, but commits a series of violent anti-social acts that make her seem nearly as morally bankrupt and contemptible as the individual she wants to bring to justice. She has received considerable praise for her performance as a strong woman, but her actions (including an incomplete conspiracy in the final scene), would seem to justify some of the invectives hurled at her character by the ex-husband, daughter, son and other characters. Her performance is largely single-note. Her character displays about as much remorse for her actions as the Only Black Lives Matter urban terrorists display for their acts of physical assault, arson and vigilante assassination. That the film tacitly condones her acts and this character is being singled out as some sort of cinematic role model is a sad commentary on society. <br/><br/>A good drama or comedy should have a strong moral. The protagonist should confront some obstacle that proves insurmountable until he or she learns some valuable lesson about life and somehow becomes a better person. The moral to this movie is stated in a letter written by Willoughby (Harrelson) to Dixon (Rockwell), but no character follows the advice. Mildred becomes more forgiving and patient in one aspect of her life, but perhaps not in another. Social issues, like police brutality and vigilante assaults on police officers are touched upon, but largely for comedic effect. Often, characters seem to behave in irrational manners in order to make some incoherent political statement. <br/><br/>McDormand also had a supporting role in John Sayles's ""Lone Star,"" which was a highly effective drama/mystery that explored various social issues and which had a diverse cast. But the social issues were seamlessly woven into the plot of LS and presented from various viewpoints without bias. In TBOEM, the social issues seemed tacked on and the plot and character motivations seem contrived to highlight them. <br/><br/>Even the titular billboards seem contrived. Five thousand dollars per month would seem excessive, even for billboards in the heart of a city with slightly over a thousand residents. Considering that the billboards were disused and hadn't generated any income in several decades, she probably could have gotten the billboards for much less, perhaps as little as $100/month each or $250 for the three, and why wouldn't they accept it? (Why a city the size of Billings even has a company specializing in outdoor advertising is also a mystery.) Simple two-color printing job with no artwork. Pitch it as a PSA, get the price for vinyl sheets down to $500, if not for free. A couple of hundred to hang the sheets. Donald Trump could have gotten the billboards for a year for $5,000. But $250/month doesn't have dramatic weight, gravitas. At $5,000, she has to sell her truck and scrounging up the rent for the following month becomes a significant obstacle - not realistic, but significant. <br/><br/>But the filmmakers wouldn't want Mildred to behave like Donald Trump. Instead, she behaves like staunch fiscal conservatives regard liberals as behaving, by tossing excessive money at a situation others don't even regard as a problem; with no reason to believe the expenditure will produce any positive results, without even trying to get the best, most cost-effective deal or waiting for a quote before giving her best offer, and belligerently insisting on continuing the effort, even when the results seem to cause nothing but problems with no discernable benefit. <br/><br/>Rather than a heroic character, Mildred seems a cynical caricature of liberals."
"Prismark10","7","2","5","9 January 2018"," Vengeance is mine
","Martin McDonagh has directed a clever crime drama with black humour which tips a wink to the Coen brothers, although as a writer McDonagh's screenplay also has some holes which are difficult to gloss over.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers link is maintained by a powerful bitter performance from Frances McDormand who plays Mildred whose teenage daughter was murdered almost a year earlier an the police have got nowhere with their investigations.<br/><br/>Mildred takes matters into her own hands and creates a spark of incendiary dynamite, by hiring three billboards to shame the Ebbing chief of police chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) to action. Her action shocks and shames the small town, the local police do not take well to Mildred's action especially as Willoughby is dying of cancer.<br/><br/>Hot headed police officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) who got away with beating up a black suspect thinks he can bully Mildred, he certainly intimidates the man who rented out the billboards. However he finds that this grieving mother is too hard boiled for him.<br/><br/>There is almost a freewheeling style to this film although if you are familiar with McDonagh's previous film, that a lot of it comes together at the end. Despite the bleak subject, there is a lot of humour here as well as tenderness.<br/><br/>It is terrifically acted from the main leads, McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson all vying for Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>You also get good performances from other actors in smaller roles such as Caleb Landry Jones as Red the advertising agent who rents the billboards out and gets thrown out of the window for his troubles. Also John Hawkes as Mildred's ex husband who left her for a teenage girl.<br/><br/>However you also have outward display of brutality from a serving police officer, a man in a bar who beats up an officer and Mildred who shows signs of violence and no one gets arrested."
"proud_luddite","9","2","5","7 January 2018"," McDonagh and a great team create a very intense film
","Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) grieves the death of her daughter who was murdered seven months ago. She expresses her dismay of the unsolved murder using the eponymous billboards implicitly placing blame on Ebbing's police chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). As Willoughby is having serious personal troubles, the townspeople are not amused.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Martin McDonagh (also the film's director) has flaws but it is also fascinating with unexpected twists and developments with an open-ended conclusion. The flaws include an unexpected redemption with great sacrifices from a character who shows the worst possible characteristics in film's first half. But the narrative is praiseworthy for its various conflicts plus taking the viewer in directions that one would not expect in a ""redneck"" story. It is also rich for the ambiguity in all characters.<br/><br/>This is especially apparent in Hayes. There are moments that might have been cheap you-go-girl cheerleading chants but McDonagh and McDormand (the McDo team, perhaps) are too smart for that. It is often easy to sympathize with Mildred but there are times when her actions and words either go too far or deliberately cause undue harm to others. But for the times that are easy to sympathize, McDormand has a delivery that is so powerful that one is left too aghast to cheer.<br/><br/>While many elements of the film are praiseworthy (the script, the performances of McDormand and Harrelson as well as Sam Rockwell), the standout work comes from McDonagh as the director who connects it all together superbly. Regardless of what is happening, there is rarely a moment that feels false and never one that doesn't feel intense."

","Here in the UK, you can tell when we're entering a new year in film when the films that are expected to be big hitters come awards season start being released week after week throughout January and February. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is certainly one of the aforementioned big hitters and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Still feeling aggrieved and frustrated by the lack of police investigation going into the violent rape and murder of her daughter, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) hires out three billboards on a stretch of road to challenge the local police, polarising the local townsfolk in the process.<br/><br/>Martin McDonagh made such an impression on me back in 2008 with In Bruges, a film that shook my funny bones to the core however, with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, McDonagh has delivered a black comedy driven by an emotional complexity unlike any of his previous films. <br/><br/>Grief, tragedy and justice are all key themes in Three Billboards and McDonagh incorporates them brilliantly into his film through both the narrative and the memorable characters he has written. I howled with laughter at In Bruges and, while Three Billboards is full of some devilish laughs, McDonagh's latest evoked far more emotion from me than I was expecting. The story takes a few turns that I didn't expect it to and I have to applaud McDonagh for that.<br/><br/>As strong as the writing is, Three Billboards is really driven home by a phenomenal ensemble cast, led by an exceptional Frances McDormand as the mother seeking justice in her own way. McDormand is fantastic at showing both the hard exterior and emotionally driven interior to Mildred, akin to the character she portrayed so brilliantly in Fargo. The supporting performances given by are of the highest order too, Woody Harrelson as the police chief living with his own personal troubles and Sam Rockwell as the officer with a penchant for unlawful policing, the latter making himself a major contender for Best Supporting Actor awards in the process.<br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a profound piece of cinema that presents much more to its audience than any of the trailers suggest. If you're a fan of films with great dialogue and even better performances, this is a film you will not want to miss. What a start to 2018!!"
"katz6","9","2","5","7 January 2018"," Rich characterizations in this near-perfect black comedy
","Martin McDonagh's new film gives us a glorious Frances McDormand performance (I believe she is incapable of delivering a bad performance), a tight script that is funny and riveting from start to finish, and surprising character development. The film plays like a tribute to a Coen Brothers' film (change the location to a larger town in Missouri, and it could have easily been called ""Joplin""...) <br/><br/>McDonagh, who is not an American, captured the look and feel of a depressed rural town in middle America perfectly (although filming in North Carolina instead of the Ozarks loses the authenticity a bit...) The characters played by McDormand, Sam Rockwell (another actor incapable of delivering a sub-par performance), Woody Harrelson, and John Hawkes initially come across as stereotypes (angry mother, unhinged deputy, righteous sheriff, abusive ex husband, respectively), but the arcs of their stories take unexpected turns. The most satisfying experience in the theater this year. And McDormand's lashing out at a local religious figure, calling out the utter hypocrisy of the Evangelicals in this country, is alone with the price of admission."
"titaniumframedbot","10","2","5","7 January 2018"," Even the silent scenes have a lot to say...
","I am a movie buff and I rarely review movies or anything at all. But movies like these make me step out of my zone to support what this film portrays. I literally created an IMDB account just to review this movie, that should say enough.<br/><br/>The plot starts right off from the first scene without any story build up or anything. The bluntness and the intense emotion that are displayed by the lead actress (Frances McDormand) are really what carry the movie. Her agenda to wake people from her town and stand her ground against all odds is the true essence of this film. Watching her holding it together and staying strong just invokes emotions among the viewers. The bluntness and timing of the situations gives it some light comical moments. The movie has several moments of sunshine where you just feel some intense emotions while never losing the pace and the plot.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this, but all I will say is this movie is worth a watch and deserves a lot of credit and recognition. 
Highly recommended!!!"
"jazfro","Null","2","5","7 January 2018"," a flawed but entertaining drama
","Don't get fooled by the categorizations. This is not a crime thriller or a comedy. It's more like a classical greek drama, with violence, intrigue, pathos and comedy in equal parts.
Some of the parts are extremely well executed: the violence and comedy stand out, and Frances McDormand leads the way in both. As a grieving and p***ed-off mother who just lost her daughter to a rape/murder, she is emotional, forceful and displays the unhinged, seemingly calm, no-nonsense behavior of people who have nothing left to lose.
Other parts are less convincing: the intrigue is without an ending, and some of the pathos lacks believability. I was left wondering about the ending, and the late reconciliation between Mildred and Dixon did not convince me. 
The movie was helped along by good supporting cast appearances by Woody Harrelson, Peter Dinklage (whose character was under-developed) and Clarke Peters. 
Some themes of the movies touch on racism, exclusion, and male chauvinism, but the execution could have been more powerful.
Quite a few scenes stand out where Frances McDormand as Mildred tells her truth to the town (the police chief, the advertising guy, her ex, her son, and a few others) in a way that merges comedy and tragedy that was touching and funny at the same time. This for me was the memorable part of the movie.
Overall a watchable movie, but no masterpiece - and please forget the references about Fargo or other Coen brothers' movies: the tenor and perspective are different."

At first glance you side with the mother of the brutally raped and murdered daughter but as the movie goes on you begin to feel for the town and why they appose the billboards.<br/><br/>I love when a movie provides conflicts for the viewer and allows you to question your own morals. Would you give up hope and accept that the perpetrator will not be found or will you stop at nothing to find your daughters murderer?<br/><br/>One would hate to ever find out. <br/><br/>Hated the ending.

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a black comedy murder mystery starring Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths), it is quite possibly one of the cleverest and best written films of its genre in several years.<br/><br/>In the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, divorced mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) grieves over the murder of her daughter Angela several months earlier. Fed up with the way local authorities are handling the investigation, Mildred decides to take matters into her own hands and rent out three abandoned billboards near her home to try and find the culprit herself.<br/><br/>Featuring well-balanced comedy and drama, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a highly entertaining and amusing film, which also serves as a commentary on police ineptitude and vigilantism. The film's screenplay crackles with wit and clever humour, which helps move the story along at a brisk pace. Frances McDormand is superb as Mildred Hayes, a character so well written it is practically impossible not to cheer for her whenever she is onscreen. This is easily her best role since Fargo, which this film feels like something of a spiritual sequel to, due to its Coen brothers-esque tone. Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson also gave great performances as the local police trying but failing to find who killed her daughter. Despite their incompetence, the two are still likeable for the most part and we feel their frustration while searching for the culprit.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"
"AnishMisra","9","2","5","1 January 2018"," Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Review
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a film written and directed by Martin McDonagh. I hadn't seen a trailer for this film nor heard of the director. Seeing the Golden Globe nominations got this film to my notice. And I can say that this is one of the best films of this year.<br/><br/>Plot: Mildred Hayes has three billboards outside the town much to many people's dismay.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film doesn't deal with the subject of rape but with the effects that a voice can have when it is displayed on a thing like a billboard. I liked the variation each of the main characters had. Lets start with Mildred. She always has a kind of rudeness which remains constant throughout the entire film. That can be because she has hardened up because of the incidents that have happened. She also breaks down at certain moments in the film which was the perfect way of her emoting her sadness. Now about Chief William; he is one of those who wants to abide by the law. That was very well written in the screenplay and how he is not able to do anything is very well shown. Now about Jason Dixon. He is one of those characters who just has about a problem in anything. But the sudden change in his character during the second half of the film was quite appreciated. The film has also very nicely interwoven the reactions and actions taken by people because of Mildred's action. The film is very beautifully shot, thanks to cinematographer Ben Davis. The colors which are transcended on screen look very real. An engaging background music by Carter Burwell also contributes to the greatness of this film. A fault that I felt, which may be me only, was towards the ending where I felt that it wasn't quite necessary.<br/><br/>Performances: Frances McDormand was great in her role. The variations in her role were well emoted by her. Woody Harrelson was good in the role written for him. Sam Rockwell was the highlight of this film. The variations that his character had were like none. Lucas Hedges was a great addition to this cast. Abbie Cornish looked quite honest in her role. Clarke Peters too delivered an honest performance. Peter Dinklage will always be loved no matter how long the role.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The very first scene where Mildred just goes to the ad agency and just says what has to be written on the three billboards. The dialogue delivery and mood created in that scene was great and that attracted me to this scene.<br/><br/>Verdict: I would say that I was floored with this film. It is filled with Award worthy performances and one of the best 2017 had to offer.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."
"jackosmithy","9","2","5","1 January 2018"," We need more Martin McDonagh
","It usually takes about 4 years for Martin McDonagh to release another one of his films. We waited 5 years this time, and it was totally worth it.<br/><br/>The positives include the performances, particularly by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell, with John Hawkes and Woody Harrelson also standing out. As usually Martin McDonagh's writing is funny and boundary-pushing while never losing the heart of the film in his own jokes. The characters are also very well written, with Mildred not being the female powerhouse that the trailers suggested. The directing of Martin McDonagh has always been good but this film steps it up a notch, with the film capturing the feel of the town brilliantly in the early stages.<br/><br/>The negatives only really include a slightly dodgy performance by Lucas Hedges and one or two scenes that used cheesy emotional music when it didn't really need to be there. These are very small things that just prevent this from being a 10/10 film.<br/><br/>To conclude, Martin McDonagh proves himself to be one of the best writers around and Three Billboards out Ebbing Missouri probably being his best film yet. Hopefully Martin McDonagh will get nominated for screenplay at the Oscars as well as best performances by Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell."
"sanjidparvez","9","2","5","30 December 2017"," The pain underneath the rage
","No parent in this world deserve to loss a child by an unspeakable tragedy or a brutal crime but when they does, not every tragedy teaches us tolerance and not everyone can get to channel their grief & anger through an unorthodox way like Frances McDormand's Mildred did in this emotionally moving dramedy. And as we know the world is far more complex & unpleasant place than most celluloid projections but it takes a remarkable storyteller & filmmaker to convey that in a convincing manner and Martin McDonagh did this wonder in his latest and this year's one of the best films here. When the little town almost starts to forget about the vicious rape & murder of her young daughter, the aggrieved mother Mildred Hayes rents the three abandoned billboards near her home to protest over the lack of progress in the investigation. This leads to pressure on the townsfolk's favorite chief (beautifully played by our favorite Woody Harrelson), resulting anger from his loyal officers, and so on down the line. This is a darkly funny, yet a very profound film where most of the major characters were flawed by their decisions or actions, torn apart inside by grief or frustrations and that made it so grounded & compelling. Almost every actor in their assigned role did justice to the solid & neatly written scripts where the character developments turned out one of the most strongest elements of this movie. McDormand on the lead delivered clearly an Oscar worthy performance, she was so great with her character's internal language...time to time slowly revealing the pain underneath the rage was something so stunning & compelling to watch that I haven't seen in most of the acclaimed & major films of recent years. Sam Rockwell just nailed his supporting role of Dixon, a small town racist police officer, the development & along the way the changes in his character were another striking part of the film. Not just being a fan of McDonagh's IN BRUGES (2008), I think this is the best film of the year that really deserve some major recognition in coming award season."

","The night before I saw ""Three Billboards..."", my wife and I were talking about how surprised we are that, with all of the hot button issues swirling around America's cultural conversation right now, very few of them are being addressed in movies. Then I watched Martin McDonagh's (who ironically isn't even American) angry, sad, and haunting film and feel like it, along with ""Get Out,"" also released this year, will be remembered as a film that captured a specific cultural moment better than many others playing in theaters at the same time.<br/><br/>""Three Billboards..."" is I think a movie whose sum is better than any of its parts. It's problematic, primarily in the uneasy tone McDonagh tries only fitfully successfully to create. It feels too often like someone trying to impersonate the Coen brothers but not quite getting it. Early attempts at dark humor fall flat, and eventually the screenplay just gives up trying to be funny altogether, and that's when the movie is at its best. McDonagh also suffers from a lack of discipline, and issues are addressed, like black distrust of the police or religious hypocrisy, that don't feel completely integrated into the movie's themes. But overall this didn't bother me as much as it might otherwise have, because more than anything this movie is about that undefined anger that seems to be pervading our culture right now and makes its target whatever happens to be in front of us in the moment. The two main characters in this film are overcome with a sense of helpless rage, much of it legitimate and targeted, some of it not, and both are faced with the same decision -- do they continue to feed it, or do they let it go? The way they and the movie answer that question is disturbing in a way that sneaks up on you and gets in your head. I realized days later that I was still thinking about this movie.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson are excellent. Sam Rockwell is good with what he's given to do, but one wishes his character had been better written. As it is he's a caricature up to a point, and then he does a complete turnabout that comes out of thin air and feels like a case of satisfying character development being sacrificed for the sake of plot mechanics.<br/><br/>Like ""Get Out,"" time will tell how well ""Three Billboards..."" holds up, but for now it's one of the few movies that has its finger on the pulse of what's happening to America, and that's enough.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"prince_c3","6","2","5","3 December 2017"," Almost perfect...I mean almost
","Well, this movie was totally a different Genre compare to all the CGI movies these day running's. Basically, after seeing all these so called comical movies, it's been a long time when a movie with real humans, with real human issues, real human tragedies to watch is a feast. I believe the major set back for this movie was, when the director decided to give it a black comedy genre. Basically, this could be as good as Francis McDormand Fargo, but I believe she still should win Oscar for her performance in this movie too. This movie shouldn't treat as black comedy. Everything about this movie, cinematography, direction, acting especially all the leading characters, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell and of course the very best Francis McDormand did an awesome job. Except with a few major flaws, first and foremost the comedy part of the movie, there isn't anything wrong in few dialogues, but labeling it black comedy for me took away the essence of this movie, this movie could be very, very tragic. Second, it could be possible that a racist cop could have a change of heart from a dead Supervisor letter, but practically not possible. So, if both characters allowed to grow and Woody character instead of just letter showed his love by his actions, could have made it more believable. Overall, the movie was really awesome and one of the best so far in 2017, especially amongst all those humans animated super hero movies. Before this I really like Jackie Chan The Foreginer."

"korereviews","7","3","10","3 December 2017"," Not terrible, but not as good as hyped either
","Reviews for Three Billboards are very polarized, with most loving it unequivocally and some utterly hating it. Those who hated it seem for the most part to be people who weren't familiar with Martin McDonough's other work, and were shocked/confused/repulsed by the black humor in this film. So, for the record, if you didn't like In Bruges or Seven Psychopaths, this film probably won't be to your taste. If you go into Three Billboards expecting a traditional drama (or comedy), you will be disappointed. <br/><br/>McDonaugh's stock in trade is quirky, flawed characters presented unapologetically; witty, sharp dialogue; and clever, unexpected plot turns. In these respects his work is very reminiscent of other playwright/filmmaker David Mamet. Like Mamet, McDonough's film's have a very theatrical feel to them - naturalism is not his thing. He also shares with Mamet a certain superficiality: what interests both is weaving witty, clever tales that surprise you at the end. While there are good character studies along the way, their films are by no means deep. <br/><br/>Some see McDonough's apparent indifference to the moral failures of his characters nihilistic. I did not find this to be the case in Three Billboards. Here I think there is sufficient complexity and nuance in the character arcs to preclude this. No one is ""redeemed"" certainly; but those who do bad things certainly pay a price (if indirectly). (By contrast, I would say that the black comedy ""Killer Joe"" was utterly nihilistic, and for that reason totally unpalatable.) <br/><br/>So at a minimum, you have to be open to McDonough's style. I am; but as the title of this review indicates, that wasn't enough to make me love this film. The positives, in brief, are Frances McDormand and especially Sam Rockwell's performances. Woody Harrelson is also good, as usual. In addition, there are some good ""McDonough"" moments of clever writing and witty dialogue. Unfortunately, and here come the negatives, those moments are interspersed with A LOT of dialogue that sounds very contrived and results in awkward performances and moments that just fail to hit their mark. Many things that are supposed to be funny just fall flat. <br/><br/>In addition, there are too many implausible elements that become huge distractions in the film: Woody Harrelson's prolific cursing in front of his small daughters (which doesn't seem to fit with his overall character); the fact that Rockwell's policeman throws a man out a window in front of the new sheriff and doesn't even get arrested for it, let alone charged with anything. While these problems have to do with bad writing, more frequent are things that just seem like poor direction. McDonough is good enough at setting up nicely composed shots, but isn't very expert at telling a story in film. When so many of the scenes involving top-notch actors like McDormand, Hawkes, Rockwell etc. come off as clunky and stiff, you have to assume it's the fault of poor direction. (Also some poor casting: e.g. sheriff Willoughby's bizarrely young and Australian wife!) <br/><br/>Indeed,I think McDonough would be much better off turning his scripts over to a seasoned director. In the hands of someone more skilled, Three Billboards could have been a 9/10. As things stand, it's worth about a 7 - and that mostly because the lead actors here elevate the material.<br/><br/>One last thing: this film is supposed to be set in Missouri, but is obviously shot in the Appalachian mountains (which look nothing like Missouri). That's just lazy. In Bruges was shot IN BRUGES - not in Ghent, or Oostende. How hard could it have been to shoot in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri IN MISSOURI - or just change the title?"

"TheBigSick","Null","3","11","13 November 2017"," The best drama of the last decade
","""Three Billboards"" is a funny, thrilling and heartfelt journey about life, understanding and forgiveness. Actually, very few movies can be funny, thrilling and heartfelt at the same time, and this is surely a great achievement by this movie. <br/><br/>The screenplay, acting, directing, music score, soundtrack, cinematography, makeup and production design are undoubtedly perfect and top-notch. Frances McDormand has long established herself as one of the best actresses of all time, and in this movie, she exhibits incredible abilities in line deliveries, facial expressions and body movements. Sam Rockwell also shines throughout the movie by perfectly playing a retarded yet heartwarming cop, and shows a clear transition. The music score is sensational, especially when the three billboards gets burned. The cinematography sometimes mimics one's gaze and is amazing. The screenplay is genius in the sense that you never know what is going to happen next. <br/><br/>There are several moments that are simply unforgettable and touching. For example, Red forgives about Dixon, who beats him up, and offers him a cup of orange juice. Also, Dixon forgives Mildred, who burns him, and says ""who else could it be"". Mildred forgives his ex- husband, who burns her billboards, and does not throw the bottles on him. James covers up Mildred's crime and makes a dating story. The worker offers to rebuild Mildred's billboards after they are burned. An interesting thing in the movie is the two letters of Willoughby, one to Dixon and one to Mildred. In fact, the letter to Dixon changes his personality, and it really shocks me that when he gets burned, he still thinks of protecting the case files of Angela Hayes. <br/><br/>All in all, this is definitely the best film of 2017, and possibly the best of the last decade."

The Cohens WOULD have had dry irony, this has the WORST stereotypes of everybody in the south & its not even a decent mystery, its a catharsis of revenge. Nice people they are not. Also Everyone is a victim. I just dont believe anything that happens becsuse consequences dont seem to exist. And the bad guy isnt maybe guilty!..Poor Missouri. It gets alot of bad movies made about it! The music always steers you to what you should be thinking also the casting was bad for females. McDormant has range all right! Her & her slippers beat all the acting in every DC comics film. The stars are one each for Sam & Frances. They are great character actors but have skills beyond the material.

","A modest, musical opening that prepares oneself for the long as well as tough journey.<br/><br/>Before understanding what the movie is about, one can easily perceive the solid acting of each and every one of the actors and the actresses.<br/><br/>A harsh reality in the realm of the movie would not welcome but beleaguer oneself. A daughter... first of all, a human being is to receive a severe beating, a rape, and finally a death of the hellish nature... And her mother, despite living as a divorcee with her teenage son, tries very hard to bring the person(s) to justice. <br/><br/>For this, she attracts the attention of the impuissant Ebbing Police Department, which could not find any clue as to who is the monster behind, by renting the three bilboards outside Ebbing Missouri. <br/><br/>An original heartache! (Sorry that the words of mine seem cold.)<br/><br/>The story takes turns for both better and worse. But how are the people related to that?..<br/><br/>Mr. Sam Rockwell is a good actor that assumes the role of a racist, high-handed police officer, Dixon that believes in good and evil, and tries to keep the balance in favor of the justice by acting unrighteously towards people. He is a nearly-lost person. And lost means ""below his capacity for ever"". <br/><br/>So, all the cursing, misbehaving, and narrowmindedness drag him at a crossroads that will give rise to a new perspective and change how he behaves faced with problems, by the barbarous act of Mildred, the character of Ms. Frances McDormand. <br/><br/>And, in my culture, this is called ""Bin naseehatten bir museebet yeghdir."" meaning: ""A calamity is worth more than a thousand advices."" So, Mr. Sam Rockwell rocked real well. (Sorry, I had to be that awful!)<br/><br/>Ms. Frances McDormand is a good actress, no doubt!.. Her character Mildred is about to depart from the straight and narrow, and turn all her suffering into an ironfist which would crush anyone and everyone that is between her and the attacker of her daughter. An obloquy, an arson, and possibly a murder! <br/><br/>Even tough she is a tender-hearted person that comes to the rescue of an insect on windowsill!..<br/><br/>Okay, most would say that it is her right to receive justice. Yes! And some would continue that she needs to trust the system for that. That, too!.. But if the system cannot function properly, what does she need do do?.. Sit empty-handed?.. <br/><br/>No! If this earthly system of ours cannot find the perpetrator, she can, of course, force the pace but not however she can! Yes, we are but weak! But if we cannot trust the system by perfecting the system at every turn, the system becomes the very monster that eats our soul! <br/><br/>It nearly ate Mildred's soul...<br/><br/>Yes...<br/><br/>The cinematography is fashioned to be as neat as it can be! That is why we have strong acting all along the movie by nearly every actor!.. It feels, because of this, as if the movie is a chess game each piece of which plays an important part in harmony, that is the movie!..<br/><br/>So, save a plate for Mr. Woody Harrelson. For not he has worked pretty in this movie too, by the character of Willoughby whose only crime is to leave his family behind, but for he is a human. If not guilty, serve him food; would we?..<br/><br/>Here is the 29th Verse of the 4th Chapter called An-Nisa (The Women) in the Gracious Koran, that is of my culture:<br/><br/>""O ye who believe! Squander not your wealth among yourselves in vanity, except there be a trade by mutual consent, and kill not do not kill yourselves (or one another). Lo! Allah is onto you Ever-Merciful.""<br/><br/>P.S.: Special thanks to the writers, the producers, the cast and the crew for pointing out the evil brilliantly. We hope no one is to hurt anywhere.

The subject matter and the overall tone of the picture are very strong: anger, hate, violence and grief dominate, and I honestly did not grasp that comic touch noticed by some criticism.
No doubt everything works inside the picture: screenplay and shooting reinforce each other, but they could not work at full, hadn't they been supported by the top-notch acting.

"heromngmnt","9","2","6","28 February 2018"," The best of 2017?
","Three Billboards got plenty nominations in the main categories, especially two in Supporting Actor which is not so common. I must say, both earned without a doubt, however Rockwell stole the show completely. No wonder he received Golden Globe and I am counting on the Oscar for him as well. His Dixon is a complex stereotype. On one hand he's a little mentally challenged and very angry policeman, on the other - a person with principles. The way he is portrayed blew my mind. Sam makes it special and he steals every single minute. Woody on the other hand has more impact on the storyline, especially in the beginning. But his acting was so similar to what I've seen in True Detective, so it wasn't as impressive as it might be.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand is the soul of the film. She gives it character and power. As a strong mother whose child died tragically, she is a woman so independent, she runs out of any scale. Title billboards are some sort of a symbol of not giving up and the whole story is basically about that. What I enjoyed the most is that the film is a chapter from the book of Ebbing, Missouri. But it's neither first nor the last one. More like a piece of a story that never ends. The story of the living. It began somewhere and it ends, too, but nothing really starts and finishes at the same time.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, it was perfected in the smallest details. Even Tyrion Lannister (aka Peter Dinklage) and his heartbreakingly short role was just pure gold. And the dark humour is the one I enjoy.<br/><br/>About music - it was more of a good background than playing first fiddle. It was barely noticeable, in my opinion, however did make a good tension."
"tmpsvita","9","2","6","28 February 2018"," Another great movie from Martin McMcDonag
","Martin McDonagh despite having made very few films, just two before this (""7 psychopaths"" and ""Bruges""), with each of them has proved to be a great director, I'm sorry a little fot the fact that he worked ""little"", but better only three and excellent movies than thirty mediocre.
And even with this ""Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" McDonagh is able to do a good job, indeed in this case it could be promoted to extraordinary work; it is not in fact difficult to define it his best film.
A very powerful film, strong, even quite heavy but still engaging that manages to tell a truly incredible story in a very credible and human.
Human, powerful but at the same time also a bit 'cold and perhaps this is one of the few flaws that can be attributed, the director in fact, probably with the fear of exaggeration and finally realize a feel-good movie has tried as much as possible not push too much on emotion. As much as I appreciate this (the tearful films are not really my kind) I have to say that I would have preferred more attention on the feelings, do not get me wrong but in some moments I felt a certain distance / coldness of the director and due of which the film fails to completely displace the viewer or to make him excite as much as it could.
With all this I do not want to discredit the film, cause , it is a great movie, as I said in the first lines.
The direction, apart from that, is really remarkable, especially from the point of view more visual and technical, the shots are, in fact, extraordinary: extremely precise, clean, suggestive. Some of the images in the film are truly unforgettable.
The interpretation of the protagonist, Frances McDormand, is also unforgettable, an actress whom I particularly appreciate and who in this case has really given her best, has entered perfectly in her character and succeeds, thanks to her expressions and incredibly convincing looks, to be credible as few would have succeeded.
Also I was speechless to see a Sam Rockwell so good, has always been a difficult actor for me to appreciate mainly for his face that reeks of second best (although I have already appreciated him in ""The Way Way Back"" while I still have to see him in "" Moon""), but with this film I completely changed my mind, he really surprised me a lot.
While Woody Harrelson I have always thought totally the opposite and with this role is interpretation has only reconfirmed his skill.
A special mention goes to the truly extraordinary, captivating, mature, sharp and profound script.

"jamesrichwalls","8","2","6","12 February 2018"," An incredible concoction of the gritty real with exaggerated fiction
","As with Martin McDonagh's 'In Bruges' and 'Seven Psychopaths', 3 Billboards is a film that that wears the crude and crass as a badge of honour. But McDonagh also adeptly weaves a story that is both surprising and easy to invest in.<br/><br/>We see fantastically performed caricatures in the abhorrent Dixon (Sam Rockwell) and the well-meaning but traditional Police Chief (Woody Harrilson). These are well balanced by the more grounded and impressive performances of Frances McDormand, as the gritty and determined Mildred, and Get Out's Caleb Landry Jones. It's a strange, but enjoyable line to walk between the exaggerated and the gritty real.<br/><br/>The themes of hope and hopelessness, redemption and damnation, prejudice and and love are all explored on the backdrop of a hyperbolic backwater USA and underpinned by western-esque guitar motifs from composer Carter Burwell of Fargo and True Grit.<br/><br/>My only complaint for this film is the occasional misplaced attempt at humour and shock. I understood, and even mentally applauded, McDonaghs signature examination of truths we often shy away from, but also felt that sometimes it was shock for shock's sake. An example would be Peter Dinklage's inclusion as the character James, who seemed to only exist in the plot to present the ritual abuse of his height. <br/><br/>Overall this is an incredible concoction of the gritty real with exaggerated fiction and features some stellar performances as a surprising plot unfolds. Some heavy handed shock humour doesn't get close to damaging my appreciation for this film."
"Pairic","9","2","6","4 February 2018"," A Dark Story With A Quirky Vein Of Humour.
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri: A dark film with a quirky sense of humour running through it. Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) has had enough, months have passed and the police are no closer to catching her daughters killers so she rents billboards haranguing the local police for their lack of action and singling out Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). This swiftly brings her into conflict with the police and in particular Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell).<br/><br/>This is a story about small town Southern life, it would be easy to characterise some of the characters as slack jawed idiots but perhaps their apparent stupidity is due to limited horizons and insular thinking. Dixon in particular comes across as rather dumb and racist but develops when given an opportunity. Much more of the films spleen is vented on the town's authority figures such as the Roman Catholic Priest who calls around to chide Mildred about the billboards. In one short scene she destroys his arguments and knocks him from the moral high ground he thinks he holds.<br/><br/>Chief Willoughby is a far more complex character who we learn is suffering from terminal cancer. He has sympathy with Mildred and shows his support in practical ways. Mildred herself is no saint and some of her demands are impractical and authoritarian. She is prone to violence with a fiery temper but then has also suffered from domestic abuse. No one has an easy life in Ebbing. There are dark, disturbing and violent scenes throughout the film but the vein of humour which runs through it is uplifting and counters the sadness. A central message is that redemption is possible. There are no Angels in this tale and perhaps just one Demon. <br/><br/>Superb acting from McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell with a convincing script, dialogue and direction by Martin McDonagh. 9/10."
"Deathstryke","7","2","6","3 February 2018"," Entertaining, but a little forced in parts
","Three Billboards sets up its protagonist's reputation as an unfearing ball-breaker right from the start; A hard-faced Frances McDormand swaggers into the office of an advertising agency, and with a wad of cash and a toilet-mouth, obtains three disused billboards with the plan to shame the police officers responsible for her daughter's murder case into action.<br/><br/>The film is fast paced, dynamically shot and well acted, with a twisty plot and a cast of flawed, but likable characters who shift and challenge expectations. I mostly enjoyed it, but I couldn't shake some niggling problems with the screenplay.<br/><br/>Much of the 'humour' relies on characters being needlessly acerbic to one another, flinging vulgar insults and random groin kicks around for a cheap laugh, which for the first 40 minutes of character set up, feels contrived, tedious and unrealistic. It doesn't take long to see a pattern emerge in these exchanges, which always show Mildred coming out on top, usually by just dropping an F-bomb and swaggering out of the room. You know, for example, as soon as the parish priest comes round for tea, that it won't be long before she makes some barb about buggering alter boys. The audience I watched it with laughed a lot at these moments, but I found myself barely making a smirk.<br/><br/>What also bothered me was the blatant leftist social justice propaganda behind a lot of this. It's like Mildred sometimes just becomes a meme-megaphone for 'sticking it to the man', in this case the useless white cops who are presented as a bunch of dumb, redneck racists ""too busy torturing black people"" to do what's right. The director may as well have dressed her in a Black Lives Matter T-shirt (I suppose it's no coincidence Mildred, always clad in overalls, bears a resemblance to the ubiquitous ""We Can Do It"" poster). <br/><br/>Those gripes aside, the second half of the film really opens up the character arcs with an unexpected turn that delivers more unexpected turns, higher stakes and the potential for redemption. Throughout the film, McDormand delivers a stellar performance that shows vulnerability beneath her hard exterior and the supporting actors do a terrific job. Recommended, but not a Best Picture winner for me."

The coot refuses to let her borrow the car or even drive her to the party resulting in an argument where the coot's last words to her daughter are, ""I hope you get raped along the way!"" Shortly afterwards, just down the road, the daughter does get raped and murdered along the way. <br/><br/>The Police launch a full investigation, but unfortunately because the DNA doesn't match anyone on file throughout the entire country, and because there were no witnesses or fingerprints any other evidence at all, they aren't able to make any arrests. After a few months, instead of contacting the Police Department to ask about any updates, the coot rents three billboards and creates some signs which basically call the Police Chief lazy and incompetent because he hasn't arrested the coot's daughter's killer. <br/><br/>The Police Chief, who is actually a decent, intelligent and hard-working person, meets with the coot and explains the entire investigation to her once again but she refuses to accept what he has to say. The Police Chief also explains that he has cancer and only has a few months to live. Mildred (the nasty coot) explains that she already knew this but because she is such a coot, she refuses to take down the billboards. <br/><br/>The local head of the Church, visits the coot and explains to her that the Police Chief is a decent, hardworking person and that she should take down the signs because he has cancer and these billboards are giving him unnecessary stress. She basically calls the priest a gay pedophile and tells him to ""f* off out of her house!"" <br/><br/>The coot randomly goes to the dentist at some point. While she's there, the dentist starts to talk about what a decent man the Police Chief really is, when the coot grabs his dentistry drill and jams it through his fingernail, leaving him screaming on the floor.<br/><br/>Also, she drops her son off at school and one of the children throw a drink in a paper cup at her car, presumably because they don't like her signs on the billboards. The coot emerges from her car in a rage and begins kicking the children in their groins until they confess who threw the paper cup.<br/><br/>Her husband, who is also distraught about his daughter's death and also quite angry about the signs which the coot has created, gets drunk one night and goes and burns down the three billboards. The coot jumps to conclusions and assumes that it was the local Police who burnt them down, so she goes and burns down the entire Police Department with some home-made petrol bombs. While doing so she gives a man horrific burns and almost kills him. <br/><br/>After the coot finds out that it was actually her husband who burnt down the billboards, she doesn't turn herself in to the authorities and admit that she's an arsonist, a criminal and a complete coot but still continues on her leftist, self-righteous path of cootishness. <br/><br/>A local man, who happens to be a dwarf, witnesses the coot burning down the Police Department but he foolishly offers her an alibi so that she doesn't get arrested. He then asks her out on a date which the coot agrees to. He takes her to a nice restaurant but during the date, she is a compete coot. She is so rude and cold and distant, stating that she was 'forced' to come along to dinner with a dwarf. This man, who is also a kind and decent person, realizes what a complete and utter coot she really is, and walks out of the restaurant, leaving her to sit there and wallow in all her self-righteous cootiness. <br/><br/>The movie ends without any real conclusion as the coot is on her way to potentially murder a man who she thinks might have raped someone, somewhere else, at some other time. What a coot of a movie."

","I just spent some time writing a piece on this film but due either to a cliche or going over the word count, it disappeared. As my main thrust was that I felt the film vastly overrated I cannot get up the enthusiasm to do it all again. Suffice to say that after a marvellous opening and beautifully setting the scene, there is really nowhere for this film to go. So, what we seem to get is a pile of jokes, mainly racist and sexist, about older guys and their bimbos or about a dwarf. Frances McDormand's performance, like that of Harrelson is too one note to be considered great. Grating maybe. Oh and since when has a woman kicking schoolgirls in the crotch been considered funny? At best this is a re-run of Coen Brother territory and at worst slapstick comedy.

","Frances McDormand has the Best Actress Oscar in all but fact for her performance as Mildred Hayes although inevitably the usual churls will emerge and argue that Mildred is so well written that any half-decent actress could phone it in. That is true but the key word is 'actress' by which we mean Bette Davis, Katherine Hepburn, Barbara Stnwyck, Susan Hayward etc. Try casting an acting joke like Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet or any of that ilk and what you'' wind up with is Old Mother Riley Goes West. Luckily Frances McDormand is the real thing and with further luck she is surrounded by serious supporting actors and a fine script. I found the same writer-directors' In Bruges to be a blatant rip-off of Harold Pinter's The Dumb Waiter but this effort is, on the surface at least, original."

","Most movies fit into a genre and follow a formula. In my opinion ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" defies classification. If you are hungry for something which is 'from' Hollywood but not 'of' Hollywood, then go see this movie. Okay, there are some plot holes and few times when you might find yourself saying, ""Oh really !!"". But, man of man, this movie is entertaining. The story line is totally unpredictable. I understand Francis McDormand is married to one of the Coen brothers and the flavour of the movie makes me suspect her husband and brother-in-law were sending a few suggestion notes in through the back door.<br/><br/>The production standards are good, much of the dialogue is brilliant, and the acting is fabulous (great soundtrack as well). Francis has to be one of Hollywood's top players and Sam Rockwell was simply brilliant. Don't be surprised if he gets nominated for his performance. He has been on my A list since I first noticed him in ""The Green Mile"" way back in 1999, and since then, with pieces like ""Matchstick Men"" and ""The Way Way Back"", he has never disappointed. Woody Harrelson has come a long way since ""Cheers"" and has matured into a great character actor.<br/><br/>Some contributors here have slammed this movie, and I can see why - it is not without some faults, but ""Three Billboards"" really is something different. Do yourself a favour, go see it and make up your own mind. But, if you are going to get bent out of shape by questions of racism and political correctness, like some reviewers, then don't bother.<br/><br/>I'm forgiving the plot holes and awarding a 9."

","This film tells the story of a woman who rents three billboards in her town in order to challenge the local police to solve the murder of her daughter.<br/><br/>Wow, this story is very intense. It is not just the subject matter that challenges the viewers, but also the action of the mother as well. It is understandable that she does what she does in the film, but somehow I get the sense of her being ruthless and almost cold blooded for some of the actions she does. Each action leads to a consequence, and the consequence leads to yet another consequence. It is almost heartbreaking to see the ripple effect of her initial action, and how it affects an increasing number of people in town in increasingly drastic ways. This story is breathtaking, and the story telling is breath taking. It is very powerful, and I would recommend it to my friends."

"CineMuseFilms","8","2","6","17 December 2017"," a mother's enraged quest for justice at any cost
","If it were possible to name the dominant emotion swirling around the world today it would be anger. Its many causes include social inequality, political instability, and global brinkmanship, all of which create a collective sense of helplessness due to events and systems over which we have no control. Any film that gives expression to this anger is cathartic, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) hits this mark right from the outset.
Seven months after the rape and murder of Angela Hayes, her mother Mildred (Frances McDormand) is ready to explode. Local police investigations have stalled, she is not getting any updates, and she believes that much more could be done. She rents three neglected billboards and plasters three simple messages against blood-red backgrounds: ""Raped while dying""; ""And still no arrests""; and ""How come, Chief Willoughby?"". The shocked town is instantly divided into those sympathetic to Mildred's plight and those supportive of terminally ill Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Police are outraged, national media get involved, and Mildred's son and former husband try to talk her out of her protest. Events spiral out of control: there are outbursts of police racism, homophobia, bashings, arson, a suicide, as well as community outpouring of sympathy for Willoughby and blame for Mildred. Undeterred and hell bent on revenge, she sets a course into nihilism without regard for the consequences.
Not since Network (1978) when enraged Peter Finch screamed ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore"" has a film penetrated the global zeitgeist with such forensic accuracy. When Mildred lets loose, it feels good and right. McDormand's powerhouse feminist performance makes this her film: no other contemporary actress does cold anger like she can and still offer a warm vulnerability to make us care. Harrelson is a complex opposite: reasonable, wounded, and compassionate. His likeability is the film's greatest complication: while we share Mildred's anger we also want to quarantine Willoughby, especially when we meet his beautiful wife and daughters.
Three Billboards is telling us that to feel human we sometimes must do extreme things. Whether you accept that message or not, this film offers a safety valve for anyone who feels crushed by the system. Labelling it a 'black comedy' is a loose fit for a film full of surprises where most of the humour is found in lightning fast one-liners laced with multiple F-bombs. The blackness lies in the moral ambiguity of Mildred's behaviour: she is channelling eye-for-an-eye justice and it matters little if the wrong person pays. Whatever you make of it, this is a gripping film that you are unlikely to forget soon.

She purchases the advertising space from Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones). Deputy Dixon (Sam Rockwell) is angered by the posters and threatens everyone from Welby to Mildred to try and take them down but no crime has been committed. Complicating matters is that Chief Willoughby is dying of pancreatic cancer. Mildred's son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) is upset by the signs because he has tried to avoid the details of his sister's death. Most of the town turns against Mildred and comes out to support Chief Willoughby. <br/><br/>Mildred experiences backlash even having to drill a hole in the thumb of the dentist in one chill-inducing scene while her face is injected with novocaine. At the local bar, Dixon confronts Red, Mildred, and James (Peter Dinklage), who is addressed derogatorily. Dixon continues to find ways to terrorize Mildred getting an idea from his mom (Sandy Martin) to arrest Mildred's co-worker Denise (Amanda Warren). Chief Willoughby brings Mildred in as the dentist decides to press charges but in the interrogation room the Chief coughs blood on her face and is taken to the hospital but not before insisting that Mildred is set free.

A meditation on the toxic power of rage and the possibility of forgiveness, this fare dwells in the ugly pain of grief. Director Martin McDonagh's incendiary screenplay is matched in quality by the score and the visuals.

"wang_zixun-01101","8","1","2","6 July 2019"," A masterpiece for character depiction, this is how we react to anger and desperation in life
","We watch all characters in movies to dutifully carry out their positions, but at Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, we see real men, women, teenagers living in the small town, involving in some unrest from three old billboards on an abandoned road. What they are arguing in so inconsequential, on which the whole movie can be interpreted in personal grudge, but they are complicate enough, like anyone else in the world, where people burn their lives to survive, to request and to hate. By the way, normally we learn it from the society.<br/><br/>Mildred Hayes, the women in the centre of the show, is the only one prepared for everything. Her weapon is never those billboards, but nothing else to lose. We see desperation in the mother heart throughout the movie, it would never diminish. We have all been tricked to hope that she might change and everything would be back on track, we persuade ourselves when she cried silently, called for doctor to check the chief, and said thank you in the first time. And the answer was clearly revealed in the end, there ain't love or forgiving, she might show the softness when hope comes, but what had supported her to continue fighting is always hatred and fury. She lived for no one but her killed daughter, and she hated equally for every chief Willoughby who failed to bring justice to her. The three billboards are not accusation or reminder anymore, it acts for a simple purpose, to tell the world that she was ready to keep pushing regardless of difficulties. It is definitely a tragedy in humanity, that we see men with possibilities to change, drown in his own desperation. It is a dead end, but many of us are doomed to walk into.<br/><br/>Chief Willoughby, the man who was accused, but understood where it came from. He had his own weakness, but he was brave enough to face it bluntly. He can predict what all could happen after his death, and he made it look as a little punishment, This was a personal payback, but he still wished her good luck finding the culprit, cause he knew it was no one's fault that justice could not be done, and thus everyone should be equally guilty. He has devoted his life to reduce the situation, but he know that it could never be done and she would always be there to request for the culprit.<br/><br/>Officer Nixon, the slightly amusing character, and we cheer for him being moved by the chief, trying his best to help even if he was fired. But what do we see in the end, a police has turned into a murder, carrying a gun to shoot arbitrary people whom he thought guilty. This is not what should expect after a change in character, but we shall never forget that anger begets anger, a small change in nature wouldn't be strong enough to counter all the frustration, failure and delusion. From a naughty young boy with his mother's control, we see him trying to survive through all this series of events and transforms into who he always wants to be, but not noticing that he was overwhelmed by anger and confusion. We hope to see him cut tie with the past, but he eventually takes that shotgun, and embarked on a trip to drive his past to the end together with any future he might have.<br/><br/>We perceive tragedies not for how sad it would be, but how much hope we gave in before. Humanity in Three Billboards is fixed, as the rest of the world, we have hope as a lotter box, but after drawing we would leave as if nothing happens, our life tracks would continue to be distort and disjoint, we simply don't have to power to evade from this, we simply cant."

","I love a good black comedy, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is precisely that. Humour is perhaps our most essential tool for discussing the dark issues we face in life, and this is a movie filled with Writer/Director Martin McDonagh's trademark dry wit and talent for combining scathing comedy with serious subject matter. Frances McDormand is a terrific lead, full of venom and thinly-veiled bitterness, scowling and sneering at those who wrong her. Her situation is understandable, as is her consternation at what she sees as a slack approach to it from her local police force, which she goes head-to-head with. Brilliant supporting roles are provided by Woody Harrelson and especially Sam Rockwell, who is the quintessential snivelling, ignorant bigot, who is given a chance to grow beyond his raw hatred and finally do some good with his life. The story itself seems to take too many digressions in the 3rd act, but I liked the uncertainty upon which it ended, and the questions it forces the audience to ask. I don't mind a perfectly happy ending it if feels right and fits the tone, and it certainly wouldn't have here. The jokes are, in keeping with the material, harsh and even cruel, but what's being presented is unpleasant, and the movie never tries to lampshade it. It never feels overlong and surprises keep popping out of nowhere. Being a huge fan of In Bruges, McDonagh's cinematic debut, I'm glad to see he is keeping the tradition of highly observant dark comedies alive."
"s_iliya_p","8","1","2","6 April 2019"," Much better than I thought!
","When you see the long title, it may seem discouraging. However, natural calmness of the city in question, adjoined its opposite nature, creates a beautiful chaos and drama. Simpler than it may seem, a disturbed mother and a divorcee demands justice for her troubled daughter's even more troubling murder case.
Much like his ""In Bruges"", McDonagh has done yet another incredible job picturing the calm and charm of a certain city, and then he disturbs you with whatever can be wrong with the city, deeper than its surface.<br/><br/>I didn't know Sam Rockwell before this movie and what a great opportunity this movie is to be introduced to him. Unlike another Oscar winner in this movie, Frances McDormand, from whom I had watched other movies before and enjoyed her acting. The combination of these two and Oscar winner Woody Harrelson, was really good. Frances portrays Mildred, a woman in her 50's, in a bad relationship with everyone and the world. Sarcastic, determined and in the verge of anarchism caused by trauma.<br/><br/>As far as my rating for this movie goes, I didn't like two important things in this movie: 1- the scene with the gazelle seems absolutely unrealistic, even the CGI isn't that good. Additionally, Frances' acting drops from its award winning quality and her speech with the animal is absolutely weak.
2- the son is ever present in the movie in most of the important scenes, but without any explanation whatsoever, he's removed from everything in the last 40 minutes.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a beautiful movie to watch and a very good story; specifically, the opening 30 minutes. The storytelling and cinematography are notable. Characters are relatable, and not black and white, but grey and lovable."

","Martin McDonagh's acclaimed drama is something of an oddity these days: An A-list, character-driven drama featuring an unwavering, deliberately unglamorous central role for a middle-aged woman. However, beyond the acting, not much about it works particularly well. There are far too many supporting characters that pop in and out of the narrative, functioning more like plot devices than believable characters, while the screenplay has an unfortunate tendency to overly rely on fate and coincidence to keep the story going. Frances McDormand is powerful and dedicated in the lead role, but beyond her colorful vocabulary the character remains an enigma to the audience; instead, the movie belongs to Sam Rockwell, whose insincere character arc is buried by his typically robust, magnetic performance."

"makleen2","8","1","2","22 August 2018"," Martin McDonagh needs to write an ending to this otherwise stellar film
","A woman seeks justice for her daughter by battling indifference in a small Midwestern town in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), written and directed by Martin McDonagh. This dark dramedy was enormously successful, raking in over $157 million worldwide on a $15 million budget. It goes to show what can happen when first rate actors play well-written characters in a compelling storyline.<br/><br/>Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is a grieving mother whose teenage daughter, Angela (Kathryn Newton), was brutally raped and murdered. Local Police Chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) has yet to make an arrest after several months. Frustrated with lack of progress in the investigation, Mildred rents three abandoned billboards and posts: ""Raped While Dying"", ""Still No Arrests?"", and ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?""<br/><br/>The billboards quickly divide the town. Chief Willoughby, while sympathetic, is suffering from terminal cancer and feels Mildred is unfairly targeting him. He fails to restrain an alcoholic and abusive police officer, Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), who retaliates against the billboard owner, Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones). Mildred is also under attack from her ex husband, Charlie (John Hawkes), another abusive alcoholic, who blames her for their daughter's death.<br/><br/>Events quickly spiral out of control, but nothing is resolved in the end. Jason Dixon is the only character who grows or has a change of heart, which is usual because he's definitely not the protagonist. Mildred remains unnecessarily mean to everyone around her, including James (Peter Dinklage), who is just trying to show her some affection.<br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri was ""inspired by true events"" when Martin McDonagh drove past several similar billboards along Interstate 10 near Vidor, Texas, just outside Beaumont. In real life, it was a grieving father who put them there after his daughter was allegedly strangled by her husband. He blames local police for dropping the ball and never charging anyone for the crime.<br/><br/>This is a sad commonality in the U.S. In 2015, NPR reported the average national clearance rate for homicide was 64.1 percent, down from 90 percent in 1960. ""Clearance"" just means someone was arrested for the crime. Last year, Chicago's murder clearance rate was only 20 percent. At least 200,000 murders have gone unsolved since the 1960s.<br/><br/>So Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri likely stuck a chord with friends and family of homicide victims, equally frustrated and wishing they could act out like Mildred Hayes. McDonagh created Mildred's character because he wanted a ""strong female"" role, and he succeeded if by ""strong female"" he meant ""raging psychopath"". During the course of the film, she tortures her dentist, firebombs a police station, and contemplates murdering a man because someone overheard part of a conversation.<br/><br/>Although Mildred Hayes' revenge is not as extreme as perpetrated by characters in vigilante films like Death Wish (1974), The Brave One (2007), and Law Abiding Citizen (2009), she personifies our primal desire to inflict vengeance against those who wronged us. While, in real life, we have to wait for the justice system to take its course, we often wish we could just ""do something,"" even if it's to rage at everyone around us.<br/><br/>I wish Mildred's character wasn't so one-dimensional. I wish she came to terms with the fact her daughter's murder may never be solved, that she found forgiveness, made peace with her ex-husband, or started a new life with James-something that gives us a glimpse of hope for the future. Instead, it was like Martin McDonagh didn't know how to write an ending, so he just stopped filming. It was a very disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to an otherwise stellar film."

"adam-may-bower","10","1","2","2 June 2018"," The Best Film of 2017
","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is undoubtedly the best film of 2017, due to its gripping storyline, stellar acting and witty screenplay.
Frances McDormand leads out this film with a tour de force performance that proves she is one the best actresses working today, and that she should definitely win her Academy Award for Best Actress. Her tough, yet broken character is brought to life and McDormand essentially steals every scene she is in. Not only is McDormand great in this, but pretty much every cast member does a superb job in their, with a special mention to Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson and Lucas Hedges.
The unique plot of this film causes it to stand out to other films in its genre and is gripping the whole way through. The ending of the film may have left some viewers dissatisfied and wanting more, but I perceived it as being the perfect kind of ending; it concludes the story while also continuing on the lives of the characters. Kind of how the end of this story is the beginning of a new one.
Throughout the film, there is never a dull moment and will keep its viewers on edge. It's underlying themes of racism (and the way this film approached it) has stirred some controversy and deemed problematic, which I disagree with. Just because it doesn't become a major plot line does not mean it's unimportant or taking the subject lightly. I believe that it was intended to illustrate how racists Rockwell's character is and that was the sole purpose. And that is fine for this film. Additionally, those who protest the transformation of Rockwell's character into a hero have honestly gotten it wrong - he is still an asshole, he is still a bigot, he is still a racist. But he is changing. He hasn't changed, but he is rather in the process of doing so. By the end of the film, we have seen him begin his process of changing and certainly doing good for the protagonist but it still doesn't justify his previous actions and neither does the film try to do so.
The overall atmosphere and tone of the film is extremely gloomy and is balanced out with it's witty (and rough) screenplay that ends up turning the film into an absurd dark-comedy that is ultimately widely entertaining. Who would have thought that Frances McDormand hurling all kinds of insults at a reporter as she drives by, would end up being one of the most entertaining scenes of 2017? Overall, this film is a triumph in every way possible and consequently has become my favourite film of 2017."

","Let me start off by quickly addressing the ""controversy"" brought on after the film's release and Golden Globe wins. The first one of people being upset that Peter Dinklage's character is continuously referred to as a ""midget"". Take a second to realize the film takes place in the clearly racially divided South; do you really think they would be politically correct? The second one being Sam Rockwell's character being a racist cop who finds redemption. It is a movie for Christ sakes! Why does everyone have to be a social justice warrior! Just enjoy the experience or don't watch it at all. This could go into a much longer rant, but I'll save it for another time; now on to the review.<br/><br/> Three Billboards... is the best film of the year in my opinion and deserves all the hardware it is receiving from award shows. The film is loosely based on a true story, but goes off trail in order to get more creative. The film centers around Frances McDormand's Mildred; a vengeful Mother who is pissed off with the small town police department because there has yet to be any arrests in her daughter's murder and takes matters into her own hands. That is already an interesting enough plot, but this film has a bit of every genre from comedy to suspense to drama all while keeping you captivated. I have to say, I'm a serial clock-glancer; always wondering how far into a movie or show I am, but with this film I didn't look once. Luckily if you've seen the trailer, that didn't scratch the surface of the story's arch; leaving you pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/> Three stories are told in this film, all involving people struggling with their past, present and future respectively; Mildred with her past, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) with his present and Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) with his future. I like how the story doesn't paint this black and white story and doesn't pit Harrelson's and McDormand's character against her with the force of good vs. evil. You find yourself sympathizing with both of them; leading to such powerful, emotional conclusions that will make you feel like you're on an emotional rollercoaster. The only bad thing I can say about this film is that damn CGI deer! What is with bad CGI this year?<br/><br/> Sam Rockwell has been one of my favourite actors for a long-time now; in my opinion he is one of the most talented performers alive. I think back to his performance in the Green Mile and wonder how he didn't manage to get an Oscar then, but this might finally be his year. In a film surrounded by acting powerhouses, he shines. Brilliantly portrayed, his character's story arch is one of the best and most satisfying ones I've ever seen in film - something you generally only see in television. Francis McDormand continues to demonstrate why she is a top tier actress and let's not forget about Woody Harrelson. Harrelson doesn't get much praise for this role, but he brings heart to a character we're meant to despise by the start of the film. Willoughby's final scene is gut-wrenching, yet beautiful and was the scene that stood out to me most.<br/><br/>Three Billboards... will go down as one of the best films Hollywood has to offer. I haven't seen a critically acclaimed film in the past few years that I enjoyed this much and therefore I'm giving this an ""A+"". If you're not watching any other film this year, make it this one; you won't regret it!"

Chiefly admirable is indeed the fact that the real themes of the movie are not visible in any way before the end.

Many point out that the escalating violence of the bitter bereaved mother and the racist junior cop are writer-director-producer McDonagh's preferred style and are as unlikely as the relative saintliness of the ""billboarded"" police chief and other characters. These commenters deny U.S. society's racism, police brutality, homophobia, sexism and hostility to outsiders that the film reflects. <br/><br/>On the other hand, liberal reviewers applaud both its accurate echo of our daily headlines and its fairytale image of ""common humanity"" ending hate (despite all history to the contrary). The extreme social pathology of the U.S. has a material source: a rapacious, violent, world-striding system cloaked in hypocrisy.

The desperate mother of the victim places exactly this question on 3 huge billboards just out of town.<br/><br/>The reaction of the small town community and its authorities towards this provocation of the police is then in the center of the movie. The idea to use a crime as a means to unmask the hypocrisy and missing solidarity of a society put to test may not be completely new, but it can still be good entertainment if it is done in a decent way as it is the case in 3 billboards.<br/><br/>The quality of acting is good. Otherwise the picturing of complex characters drawn from real life would not work out so fine. Most impressive to me was the acting performance of Sam Rockwell, which can be truly described as Oscar worthy. I was not quite as impressed by the part of Frances McDormand, who initially drew me into the movie, because I liked her so much in Fargo. Probably she did not have the opportunity to show a wide enough range of emotions in this rather ""Eastwoodian"" character.<br/><br/>Sometimes I was quite surprised how far some of the protagonists could go in their aggressions without being sued or arrested. Be it, movie theatre does not necessarily mean real life. <br/><br/>The movie is also good in tackling other disputable issues like e.g. today's role of the Church as a moral authority. Also the fact that American soldiers have committed shameful deeds in the Middle East is proposed.<br/><br/>I also liked the film's sort of loose ending. To me, however, it is quite clear that the original purpose of the started trip will not be met.<br/><br/>When watching the movie I was also quite puzzled that the fictional town called Ebbing, Missouri, was surrounded by such a hilly, almost mountainous landscape, whereas I thought that wide plains are predominant in the Mid-Western countries. It turns out that the film was actually shot in and around Ashville, North Carolina. What's the point of this? If a movie happens to play in a fictional place, why not give it a name where the landscape does correspond with the name of the movie.

","In the deleted scenes from ""Three Billboards"" that appear on the DVD of the film, there is one priceless moment where Detective Dixon arrives home late and drunk. In the small home, Dixon sleeps in the same bedroom as his mother. After some strange, over-the-top physical contact and dialogue filled with innuendo, the mother asks the son,""You didn't do nothing bad tonight, did you, baby?"" That line could apply to many of the characters of Ebbing on any given night.<br/><br/>The film is richly deserving of praise for the memorable characters. But the inconsequential ending and the overall confusion in the meaning of the film were major shortcomings in an otherwise creative effort.<br/><br/>For example, were the filmmakers attempting a satire of small town, rural America? If so, it is difficult to find any connection of the characters to reality. There was too much cruelty that stretched credibility without being truly provocative. This was especially true with the revenge-minded protagonist Mildred. With her outrageous (and criminal) behavior, one lost sympathy in a hurry for a grief-stricken and guilt-ridden mother. The character who seemed most grounded was Sheriff Willoughby, but he dropped out of the film by choice at the midpoint. <br/><br/>There were a half dozen genuine moments of dark comedy, but too many head-shaking moments where the filmmakers went overboard in depicting the most psychologically unbalanced city on the planet."
"JamesHitchcock","8","1","2","9 March 2018"," The Way of the World
","Three Billboards...."" is set in the fictitious small town of Ebbing, ostensibly in Missouri although location shooting actually took place in North Carolina. Grieving over the murder of her daughter Angela, and angered by the failure of the authorities to find the murderer, a local woman named Mildred Hayes rents three abandoned billboards just outside the town and posts placards reading ""Raped While Dying"", ""And Still No Arrests?"", and ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?"" This last is a reference to Bill Willoughby, the town's Chief of Police. <br/><br/>If the film were made according to the standard Hollywood rulebook, it would be a sentimental tearjerker. The Hayes household would be the idealised all-American family and Mildred the devoted all-American mom, with the lazy, incompetent Sheriff Willoughby the villain of the piece; the film would end with Mildred's persistence vindicated, Willoughby sacked and the perpetrator of the crime brought to justice. Fortunately, this is Martin McDonagh's film is one which ignores the rules. <br/><br/>To begin with, Mildred's family are far from idealised. In fact, they are deeply dysfunctional. Mildred's abusive husband Charlie has recently left her for a 19-year-old girl. Their son Robbie seems permanently depressed. We learn from flashbacks that Mildred and Angela frequently quarrelled, and there is a strong implication that Mildred's determination to bring the killer to justice is her way of making psychological amends for the fact that she was not close to her daughter during her lifetime, and that she may even have contributed to Angela's death by refusing to lend her the car on the night she was killed. <br/><br/>Willoughby, moreover, is far from being a villain. He is a loving husband and father, and his home life stands in sharp contrast to that of the messed-up Hayes clan. He is conscientious and takes his duties seriously, although the same cannot be said for all the men under his command. One of these, Jason Dixon, is a violent racist who will play an important role in the ensuing drama. Asked why he does not fire Dixon, Willoughby replies that if he had to fire all the racists in his force he would only be left with three men. <br/><br/>The plot of ""Three Billboards"" deals not only with rape and murder but also with terminal illness, criminal assault, arson and suicide, yet the film is in tone more of an astringent black comedy than the sentimental melodrama which would be the standard Hollywood take on such matters. Of course, there is a fine line between being blackly comic and merely being sick, but McDonagh manages (just) to stay on the right side of it, aided by a superb performance from Frances McDormand as Mildred, a woman whose reaction to her personal tragedy is characterised not only by the expected grief and anger but also by a vicious, cynical wit. McDormand's ""Best Actress"" Oscar was well deserved. <br/><br/>The ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar went to Sam Rockwell as Dixon, but I personally preferred the contribution of Woody Harrelson as Willoughby, a man who is in many ways the antithesis of Mildred and therefore provides the film with some balance, his love for his family counterbalancing her dysfunctionality and his stoical reaction to his own personal tragedy contrasting with her rage. There were some good supporting performances, although one or two things which never really added up. I could not, for example, understand what the lovely Penelope saw in Charlie. Penelope is not, admittedly, the sharpest knife in the drawer, but beautiful teenagers do not need a lot of academic intelligence to realise that they are beautiful, and that they could do a lot better than an unattractive middle-aged deadbeat whose first marriage failed because he was regularly violent towards his wife. <br/><br/>The final way in which this film departs from the standard Hollywood template is that, for all Mildred's passion, anger and steely determination there is to be no easy resolution. The crime remains unsolved and the criminal unpunished. The ambiguous, uneasy ending, however, is not a weakness but a strength. It reflects one of the film's central themes, that life is not always about happy endings and that there are some injustices which it is beyond human power to rectify, not because someone, somewhere has made a mistake, and not because someone, somewhere is not doing their job properly, but because that is the way of the world. This is something which Willoughby instinctively realises, even if Mildred does not. ""Three Billboards in Ebbing, Missouri"" is a haunting, unusual film, one (along with the likes of ""The Greatest Showman"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Murder on the Orient Express"") made in 2017. 8/10"

","An acting masterclass from a flawed script.<br/><br/>Like Blue Jasmine a few years ago (and as I correctly predicted then for that film in my imdb review), Three Billboards is an acting masterclass which deserves to win most of the acting Oscars soon in 2018.<br/><br/>This film also once again illustrates the strange, improbable fact that - incredibly - the rarest contemporary commodity in Hollywood is the simplest and most basic one, you would think: a scripted story which makes a worthwhile statement and wraps up nicely and convincingly at the end.<br/><br/>While we can go along with the proposed Dirty Harry Redneck philosophy up to a point, and enjoy the general redemption towards the end, the final scene crazily seems to have been adlibbed after the writer died suddenly before considering his options for it.<br/><br/>It would behove anyone studying to be a contemporary scriptwriter to sit down and have a look at The Third Man and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, to name just two masterpieces, to see how an ending is done.<br/><br/>Pity one should have to point such obviousness out, when so much else in this film - and certainly the several principal performances - is so memorably good and they will land Oscars tonight."
"siddheshgarg","6","1","2","25 February 2018"," Refreshingly Amazing Dark Humour
","At a time when the world is grappled with Twitter wars and political turmoil, Martin McDonagh's dark comedy is a clear winner. As the name suggests, the story does revolve around 3 billboards loaned in Ebbing by Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand). The messages across these billboards doesn't become as major as McDormand's deadpan expressions. It is her silence which stabs you with unmistakenable tenacity and vigour. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The Missouri police are mocked with their careless attitude on handling crimes, rapes and Mrs. Hayes acting as their constant remembrance of failure. Though the movie is positioned for McDormand's character to outshine, plotlines of the chief of the cops played by Woody Harrelson and Jason Dixon played by Sam Rockwell leave quite a punch on your thinking mind. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The platonic one-dimensional plotline becomes quite vibrant with Carter Burwell's soundtrack in between. Walk Away Renee by The Four Tops is one of the highlighting score in the film. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Hits: McDormand's silence, short crispt and gag-worthy messages in the 3 billboards, Caleb Landry Jones innocence, dark humour.
Misses: Drama. As much as the storyline is streamlined, there is not much to expect throughout the movie. <br/><br/><br/><br/>It is still a watchable movie :)<br/><br/><br/><br/><ul><li>SID</li></ul>"

","Mildred puts the three billboards up on a disused road in Ebbing to hit at the man she thinks, incorrectly, is responsible for her daughter's rapist and murderer never having been caught. She is a hardened and occasionally violent woman with huge eyes that reveal the depths of her suffering, even if the rest of her only seems invested in causing the suffering of other people.<br/><br/>""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is basically about hurt. It's about trying to deal with the hurt by hurting others. It's about taking the hurt upon yourself, to try to stop it before it grows, as it inevitably will. It also shows that when we take our hurt out on big targets, we end up hurting other people, who may or may not deserve it.<br/><br/>The dialogue is, as always, great from the playwright Martin McDonagh, who remains one of few filmmakers whose every film should be cause for celebration. It's not a surprise that he has great actors like McDormand wanting to work for him; this could well be another Oscar nomination from her.<br/><br/>Everybody in this movie is hurt one way or another and they all try to deal with it, mostly by spreading it around.

Since other negative reviewers have adequately covered what is wrong with this movie in detail, I'll just sum it up to say it is what would have been an average film or made for TV movie back in the days when they knew how to make movies properly. It is a mediocre sleeper flick, hyped up due to the fact that, compared to the other garbage movies that come out these days, it's a masterpiece. No one acts like a normal person, nothing realistic about anyone or anything in this ""drama"" and since when can cops just walk in and beat up people and suffer no repercussions?

Maybe people drove real slow on that road. If it didn't drag on so long, I might give it a five because it is, indeed, watchable, but it's a lame movie and totally overhyped.

","Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is upset that the police haven't solved the rape and murder of her child, Angela, (Kathryn Newton) and she erects Three Billboards to let police Chief Willoghby (Woody Harrlson) know how she feels. This also tells her that the whole town is against her and she could care less. She is extremely frustrated and feels this is the only way to get the police to do their job as it's been too long since Angela's death.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned this is simply a masterpiece. The writing, dialogues, the acting and the story itself can be nothing less. It is perfect. And when you have Woody Harrelson in the story, give him the Oscar because he is that good. Well, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but didn't get it. Bummer. Sam Rockwell as Deputy Sheriff Dixon did win the Best Supporting Actor Award. Frances McDormand did win Best Actress for her portrayal of Mildred and she was going to be very deserving and a lock. Kudos. This movie was also nominated for Best Picture and got caught in a buss-saw: The Shape of Water Otherwise...............who knows?<br/><br/>The story does take a few twists and turns that did surprise me. There is no suspense or tension in here, just good acting with good actors in a very good creative story. We will see some very deep emotions from the townspeople, the police and from Mildred too, however it doesn't go off the rails. <br/><br/>Notables: Abbie Cornish as Anne, Chief Willoghby's wife; Peter Dinklage as James, a friend to Mildred; John Hawkes as Charlie, Mildred's ex-husband; Lucas Hedges as Robbie, Mildred's son; Caleb Landry Jones as Red Welby, who sold Mildred space on the three billboards; Clark Peters as Sheriff Abercrombie; Zetjko Ivanek as the Desk Sergeant.<br/><br/>Kudos must also be given to Martin McDonagh who wrote and directed this movie.

","Frances McDormand seems to be the perfect cast for tough women with a mission, which goes both for Fargo and this one. Technically, when it comes to character, you could almost describe this as Fargo minus the snow. McDormand plays Mildred, an embittered woman on a quest to find her daughter's murderer. When the local police makes no progress, she decides to take things into her own hands and upsets everyone in the little town of Ebbing along the way, especially through the provocative red billboards asking questions that sheriff Willoughby(Woody Harrelson) isn't really trying to solve the case at all. The movie turns into a gallery of colorful characters, from the man who rents Mildred the billboards, to James (Peter Dinklage), a midget who put Mildred into her place at a dinner date that wrong. Although it's Sam Rockwell's cop Dixon who a wins you over quite easily, it's his beer-drinking mother who is left the biggest impression on me as the archetype of white trash almost bordering on comedy."

","Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is certainly a depth defining film that tells a story that we will surely not forget any time soon. Like any good film, it must have a way to both entertain an audience and make the audience feel in a certain way. Performances from Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell, and Woody Harrelson each bring a blend of love, hate, grief, loss, and a profound sense of humor. Frances McDormand is a shear Tour De Force from beginning to end as you can never forget the look and feel of a grieving mother wanting answers by any means necessary. With the case of Sam Rockwell, he brings along the humor, but also shows his recklessness as someone wanting respect and to show he has a power that people should respect. In accordance with everything from the performances to the story, all can traced back to the carefully crafted work of Martin McDonagh as both writer and director. Overall it is an excellent film providing a balanced blend of drama and comedy that will leave you cheering and heartfelt."
"flcntk3-856-986017","10","2","7","3 February 2018"," ""What price justice?""
","""What price justice when justice was not served the first-time round?"" This is the question proposed and was explored by the movie through smart black humor and irony. Given we as species are both blessed and cursed with a sense of moral right and wrong and given our world is imperfect where crime do not necessarily meet with their just retributions, we as individuals take matters into our own hand. This is where things get complicated. For one, is there a pay forward system in retribution meaning it is transferrable if the crime fits a generic similarity? Or in the name of justice, equality puts crime of the same into a cesspool of the same where if the retribution is good for the goose, it will also be good for the gander. After all, the satisfaction from seeing justice can also be transferrable from one case to another. It is a question of whether retribution should be case specific, or it doesn't matter. This puts impartiality, the essence of the blindfold on Lady Justice into a new ""funny"" limelight. On irony, there is also the irony of polar difference in attitudes towards crime. The Willoughby's realistic pragmatism that is lined with a fuzzy human touch vs the Mildred Hayes's undaunting iron will and fist of wanting justice served. They are two sides of the same coin because and this may be a surprise for some for in my opinion, they are both pivotal characters showing the two different types of human nature and human nature is what gives rise to our moral awareness, the foundation of justice. The surprise for some lies in my opinion about Mildred Hayes. For though she took center stage in the movie, she is not the protagonist of the show. The real protagonist of the show is Dixon. The catharsis that came to him, which literally changed him through a ""baptism of fire"" is when his potential of being good is acknowledged by his best buddy and mentor, Mr. Willoughby in the letter that he wrote him. Of course, later, the orange juice from the mangled Red Welby also helped to seal a new-found faith in the good side of humanity for him. As to whether justice is transferrable or not, or whether the true culprit of the heinous rape crime against Mildred's daughter is apprehended or not is relatively immaterial for both Mildred and Dixon will have some time after the end of the movie to talk about these things on their way to Idaho."
"AudioFileZ","9","2","7","27 December 2017"," A Small Town Becomes A Universal Message...Anger Begets Anger...Extraordinary!
","It's no stretch to say Three Billboards will be nominated for multiple Academy Awards. Here in one movie there's easily writing/directing, multiple performances, and cinematography that scream Oscar nominations. But, this is no art house or high film school concept piece. It's a grass roots reflection on how hate begets only more hate and how love, forgiveness, and tolerance is the only saving salvation. Yet as heavy as all of this is depicted it never beats the viewer over the head thus watering down that message. Quite the opposite as turns a soul stirring mirror expertly using darkly held prejudices and black comedy to do so.<br/><br/>None of the above could be accomplished first without the superior story telling and directing of Martin McDonagh. He has created a masterpiece of a movie from which the expert casting propels. Previous Oscar nominee Frances McDormand turns in a performance of a lifetime in her portral of an anger-filled Mildred who has lost a teenage daughter to a horrendously brutal rape and murder. She raises the ire of locals and the police force in her small town as she boldly cries for justice. That sets up more hate on the other side which erupts in myriad related as well as unrelated ways. Sam Rockwell as a non-conventional, as well as non-law abiding racist deputy, almost steals McDormand's thunder. These two characters ride an arc of hate that brings them to a place neither could have achieved without the other. Wow! They are musts for awards if the Academy isn't out in left field because they really bring a meaningful story to life. Woody Harrelson is also in top form with a role he plays effortlessly adding to the quality here. <br/><br/>If you see one movie in the next year this is one I think can speak to everyone as well as entertain."

"Obi_Bamm_Karaoke","8","2","7","17 November 2017"," Great Script, Great Cast, But Not For Everyone
","Films like ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" are an interesting case study to me in that there is a lot of buzz around it as it has been making the rounds on the festival circuit for a bit now. However, given the subject matter of the script that was also directed by ""Seven Psychopaths"" writer/director Martin McDonagh, I will be interested to see how it is accepted by a mass audience. Submitted for your perusal:<br/><br/>Mildred (Frances McDormand) lives in the small town of Ebbing, Missouri, where she is mourning the brutal death of her daughter. Nine months have passed with no leads, no arrests, and no real questions answered. Her grief in this time has gotten more and more intense, and she decides to take matters in her own hands by bringing more awareness to her community in a grand matter, getting the attention of local sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), his direct report Dixon (Sam Rockwell), and an entire community of people who take sides in a tale of the consequences of the choices we make as well as the consequences of those consequences.<br/><br/>Like I alluded to earlier, this is definitely not for everyone. Listed on IMDb as a ""darkly comic drama,"" they ain't lyin'. There is subject matter in ""Three Billboards"" on multiple levels that could make the sensitive types a bit uneasy. The odd part here is that I cannot really get into all of them without leading you down the primrose path of spoilers, so you just need to kind of roll with me on this one. And to truly convey not only the subject matter but even McDonagh's script itself, it takes a special kind of cast, and he went out and got the right people here. McDormand (who is always on her ""A"" game) continues her streak of great performances here bringing what could easily be portrayed as a woman devoid of emotion and almost downright detestable and making her on some levels a sympathetic character. Mildred's anger fuels her, even in the wrong ways in some cases, but the maternal side of her reminds her that she still needs to be a role model to her surviving child in a son, Robbie (Lucas Hedges). Harrelson continues to wow me here as the lawman that really wants to do the right thing, even in facing adversity in both his professional and personal lives and works well with McDormand and Rockwell by understanding what the dynamics have to be dealing with both characters. And if you know me, you know what a fan or Rockwell's I am, and he also does not disappoint as the cop that knows that this is really his only course of career after growing up in the same small town he wants to protect if it wasn't for the fact that he just cannot seem to get out of his own way. Peter Dinklage also has a great turn here in less of a role, but his character of James becomes very important as the third act progresses, and it all comes together in a well-crafted story that takes some turns that even caught me off- guard in a way that was a bit shocking without being ""shock value"" and adds more layers to the story in the way that McDonagh has shown with his past work in films like ""In Bruges"" and ""Six Shooter"".<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" more than I expected to, even after being told by multiple colleagues and friends how much they enjoyed it. I would not be surprised if there is at least a small buzz for members of this cast when hardware starts becoming a factor in our consciousness here in a couple of months, and with the end-of-year push hitting full throttle ahead of us for the next one hundred and forty-four days, this film may be able to find its niche amongst them."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","7","12 November 2017"," Hilarious and affecting
","So I watched Three Billboards earlier today. I really may start buying this film's chances as a true contender for Best Picture after all. Considering the incredibly enthusiastic response it got from the audience, it could very well be a consensus pic. For some reason I assumed it would be a ""harder"" film to love, but not at all. In terms of performances, these actors have really rarely been better. Frances McDormand could probably do this role in her sleep, but that's a testament to her abilities and less about it not being great work. Far from it. This role is a culmination of the many types of roles she's played in the past, and she of course delivers it perfectly. There is absolutely no other actress that I think would be able to give the work that she does. The same goes for Sam Rockwell. None of what he does here is too shocking or ""stand out"" because, just like McDormand, he's an actor who has shown traits of this role in some of his works in the past. Again, this is not a criticism but simply proof of what an accomplished and capable actor he's proved himself to be in the past. If the Oscar should come down to him or Willem Dafoe, I think it absolutely should be Rockwell's. Woody Harrelson and Caleb Landry Jones also deliver some strong, affecting work in their roles."

This movie is not about modern culture. This story and the players in it are displaying raw emotions that we all -whether we admit it or not -share. Don't look for solving a murder. Look at humans inside their cosmos. They all are struggling to face death by cancer, murder, bigotry, homophobia, growing up with effed-up parents, and changing times. Frances McDermott is always bringing her best game. Sam Rockwell as Dixon however is a tour de force. I was convinced he was an illiterate closet gay using anger to look like a man. He evolved (I could care less about his sexuality) and is that not worth a star or two? He played his part to perfection and then some. Reminded me of Ben Mendolsohn in Bloodline and Darkest Hour.<br/><br/>Go see the movie. Leave your current life in the car, train, bus, sidewalk. Take it for what it is and not what it is not."

Woody Harrelson gives a surprisingly gleeful perforce as the police commissioner battling cancer, but Sam Rockwell steals the show as Jason Dixon, a short- tempered drunken fool with signs of a heart tucked in beneath him. Martin McDonagh captures the rural Midwest in exuberant detail, portraying a realistic town of people with both depressing and outrageous content. McDonagh's script is perfect. He not only has rich and interesting characters, but explores a depressed town with struggling individuals and emphasizes their natures brilliantly. Through grief and loss, McDonagh's characters shine in spectacular fashion, depicting angered souls who all are trying to do what they feel is right, while also learning the importance of forgiveness and empathy. Few films capture human nature so poetically. ""Billboards"" reminds us the value of human beings and dances around the barriers of society.

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri , is just one of those films.

","Having been described by several critics as a dark comedy due to its tone, Three Billboards is a solid convincing story about revenge and justice.<br/><br/>The performances from the leads stage out and are given great lengths but as done points the films somewhat drags on.

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri
RATING: 4.3/5<br/><br/>The movie starts off at a good, steady pace, and then escalates little by little as it progresses. You're presented with this mother, who's daughter was raped and murdered, and the case has gone unsolved for months, so you think it's a murder mystery. As the movie goes on, you start to notice that you're following some pretty angry characters that don't know how to deal with the reality that has become of their lives. Yes, the murder is there in the background, but what you're really seeing is how this deep loss and anger affects the lead character and the people around her. Hell, she even drags some people down into her own anger as you watch them try to deal with situations in their own angry ways, and see how it ripples across the small town they're in. Once i realized that, the movie became pretty interesting to me, since their actions became more and more self destructive, and i wanted to see how far they'd take it.<br/><br/>This is very much a character driven piece and there's a lot of great acting going around. I honestly can't think of a single bad performance. There are some black supporting characters in the background, but they're really only there to establish that the town is a little backwards with some racist undertones. There's no KKK and the movie isn't trying to preach to you about race, it's just trying to let you know more about the town itself. They're small scenes and pretty subtle for a movie like this, but i can see how someone might take offense at first by jumping to conclusions.<br/><br/>I went into this movie cold and ended up leaving pleasantly surprised and a little disappointed at the way the whole thing ended. That's really the only negative thing i can say about it without nitpicking. The film ends on this ambiguous, typical indie style movie ending, and you just kinda feel cheated. You've been with these characters, seeing their anger and their actions grow and grow. You think it's all coming to a head, something that was looking to be a really satisfying ending. I was so onboard with what was about to go down and then the movie just ends. I was left sitting there thinking, ""Where the hell is my payoff???"" That's probably the films biggest mistake that stops it from being a great movie, and leaves it in ""really good"" territory. That being said, I think it's definitely worth a watch, for the great performances alone, if you get a chance."

Despite the film consisting of an award winning cast, the casting was superb and no character felt out of place. The plot was outstandingly unexpected, similar to that of a Quentin Tarantino script. As The Telegraph put it, ""Its characters continually defy your burnt-in expectations of what they'd do, and what might be done to them in turn, in a better-behaved, more formulaic script.""

"fshardlow","10","1","3","9 December 2018"," With regards to the use of red in this film
","Colour symbolism in movies is something that I appreciate very much, whilst also realising it's something that can be overdone.<br/><br/>I've awarded this film ten stars for many reasons, one of the primary reasons being how the colour red is used in this film. Spectacular. My mother didn't notice red played such a huge role, but that's when you know it's being done right. The use of red really reminds you throughout of the anger Mildred constantly feels the whole run time. With red finishes on her shop, a red sweater worn my Mildred on several occasions and flashes of red light throughout you're forced to deal with Mildred's inner emotions spilling out into the physical world. You're trapped in the anger of it all.<br/><br/>Also huge HUGE credits to McDonagh for not shying away from the violence and language presented in this movie. It just makes everything feel less Hollywood and real. Why wouldn't you swear every other minuet after your daughter was raped and killed? Some scenes are so shocking and then completely downplayed by the next scene. It's incredible.<br/><br/>Excellent film with no resolution, because in the real world, how many people actually find a resolution to crimes like rape and murder?"

","A gritty, funny, and poignant crime, grieving and redemption story that contains several strong subplots and emotional themes. Superb performance by Frances McDormand, and strong backup from Woody H and Sam R. Some of the script is outstanding, with many quotable lines, (both dialogue and monologues).<br/><br/>With the slightly exaggerated characterisation i thought it might be a Coen bros film, and i learnt afterwards that McDormand is in fact married to one of them. <br/><br/>I'm not sure i learned anything, but several ""human condition"" themes are explored quite well here in the minor sub-plots: cancer, dying, grieving, anger, domestic violence, passion, unrequited love, discrimination etc. It is an ambitious film in that respect, but i dont think that detracts from the flow of the film at all. In addition its worth noting that the comic bits are genuinely laugh out loud moments, and the poignant parts are proper tearjerkers.<br/><br/>One of my initial responses was that certain plot developments were not fully explained...for example Dixon's apparently sudden about face, and the seeming surprise amongst other characters that Mildred had become a foulmouthed badass. Ive read reviews saying these are plot 'holes'. But in hindsight, i think the director has assumed that we're an intelligent audience who know people can and do change according to extreme events in their lives, and we dont always need to be spoon fed emotional developments with flashbacks or in line by line chronological development. So for example one can assume that Dixon's time in hospital next to his victim was very reflective etc, and that Mildred had always been assertive but the loss of her daughter had taken it to a new level.<br/><br/>The only reason it doesnt get a 10 (gave it 9 as cant do 9.5 lol) for me is the slightly twee ""thelma and louise"" style ending: I dont mind unresolved endings, but just felt it was slightly formulaic."

As she becomes frustrated with the local police's lack of progress, she decides to rent three billboards on the outskirts of her hometown to send a personal message to the authorities... but what those billboards trigger is not what she expects. Great characters, great performances and great writing make movie memorable. McDormand is simply superb as the mother whose anger is just part of her problems in life. Movie is a hugely entertaining, no mater basically it's a drama. But, at times, the plot is lacking in direction and can come across as a little too sarcastic and even cartoonish at times, but overall, the writing is so strong and the acting is so on point. As a result, film is not for general viewing audiences but if you are a film buff, you should enjoy the film. 8/10"

But as others here have mentioned, the characters and dialog are what a bigoted, Guardian-reading playwright would assume of Americans, and American cops. And the real problem is that these faulty assumptions of how real people talk and behave result in a plot full of holes and cliches. Just as in ""Crash,"" if the characters in this movie behaved like actual people, then there would have been very little movie remaining.

"GoldenBlunderbuss","8","1","3","1 August 2018"," A great and memorable addition to McDonagh's quirky filmography
","A grieving mother hires three disused billboards to berate the local police force into action regarding the brutal murder of her daughter much to the anger of some of the townsfolk.<br/><br/>Martin McDonagh has done it again. Not content to leave well alone in the 'dark comedy in a serious situation' department following Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges, he's pulled together another masterpiece of this difficult genre. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (don't worry, it took me a few attempts to remember the full name too) shows McDonagh isn't done with it yet.<br/><br/>The first shots in the film show the dilapidated, unused and unloved billboards in a haze of early morning mist. These establishing shots begin a trend of scenes being rarely framed poorly, or lit and filtered without careful consideration of mood. Likewise, there are scenes that linger for just the right amount of time for the audience to contemplate the consequences and next actions.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand's portrayal of a mother hell-bent on getting justice for her murdered daughter and the personal pain she feels every day from the fractured relationship they endured when she was alive. The Best Actress Oscar she was rightly awarded was never in doubt given the clean sweep she enjoyed all through the awards season - it's certainly well-earned for her ability to carry a script that demands both dramatic and comedic moments, often in the same scene.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell earns his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor as the dim-witted and racist cop Dixon. It would've been so easy to play him exactly as he sounds - a bumbling idiotic caricature of violent cops seen all too often on the news in recent years, but Rockwell adds layers and hidden flaws to this fractured and troubled character.<br/><br/>To talk about the multiple moments in which Woody Harrelson brings his embattled Chief Willoughby to vivid (and on occasion heart-breaking) life would be to reveal too much about particular moments in the film that are best left to the audience to uncover for themselves. Harrison was rightly nominated for the Best supporting Actor gong for is efforts, although Rockwell was always going to beat him to the top prize.<br/><br/>It's a much darker film than you might expect from the trailer: there's detailed discussions of the rape and grizzly murder of a teenage girl, incredibly violent and graphic fight scenes (mostly very one-sided), and moments of such heavy emotional weight that the person next to me in the cinema started crying. The film ranks among McDonagh's most serious work yet, but the injection of his trademark humour (a 'blink and you'll miss it' line of dialogue or a subtle piece of physical comedy courtesy of Rockwell) makes it one of his funniest."

"stinkehund","2","1","3","9 July 2018"," How does this movie have an 8+ rating??
","On the surface it ticks off all the boxes. Great premise and a wonderful cast. Frances McDormand is brilliant as always. So is Rockwell and Harrelson.<br/><br/>But the comedic part seems to rely much on profanity filled dialogue. There are some great moments, no doubt about that. Samara Weawing is stellar as the clueless girlfriend. And I know many will enjoy the scene with the character of Mildred unleashing her attack on the catholic church.<br/><br/>The movie starts to crumble when Mildred start making some over the top and completely unrealistic rash choices. And when the Rockwells character suddenly changes personality, it just becomes very forced.<br/><br/>My biggest issue however, is the very very unsatisfying end to the movie. If you like your movies wrapped up with a conclusion, or just some kind of closure - stay away from this one. My fellow viewers were asking if there was a sequel or another part to the movie that we could watch.<br/><br/>If they had just made the ending a lot better much of my grievances could be forgiven or looked past. As it stands, the movie just comes across as overrated. Which is a shame for the talented acting that it contains in abundance."

"gatheringsnow","8","1","3","2 May 2018"," Anger only begets more anger
","I just finished watching this film and good golly did it leave me confused, not only for the film's climax (or lack thereof) but also because it seemed to be hinting at something much larger in the grand scheme of things. When the film begins, you think you know who's the good guys, and who's the bad guys, then certain events occur and these events force you to alter your perception of the ""heroes"" and the ""villains"" in this dark, but moving story of grief and vengeance.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand, perhaps better known for her role as pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson in the Coen Brother's ""Fargo"", is about as far from ""Minnesota Nice"" as you can get and still remain sympathetic towards. Grieving divorced mother Mildred Hayes is tough, relentless, and uncompromising, willing to do whatever it takes for justice to be served towards the person(s) responsible for the rape and brutal murder of her teenage daughter Angela.<br/><br/>In supporting roles are Ebbing, Missouri police chief Bill Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell), the latter in particular playing a deeply troubled man suffering from emotional trauma and instability. The film itself may be considered by some a tragicomedy, balancing a thin line between tragedy and comedy, but I rarely found the jokes all that funny, expect for a few instances, more often than that it came off as annoying or inappropriate considering the circumstances, but that isn't really the point. <br/><br/>To many people who view this film they might come away from it angry and unsatisfied because it doesn't really give any clear answers about it's motives or messages, simply puts them out for the film's characters and we, the audience, to view and draw our own conclusions, much like the titular three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri. Sometimes it's less about the final destination and more about the journey getting there, as rough a ride as it may be."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) is a film written and directed by Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) and takes place in small, rural, Ebbing Missouri and follows our lead actress Frances McDormand who plays Mildred, a mother who challenges the police department's competence by renting three billboards which take aim at their inability to solve the death of her daughter.<br/><br/>Mildred (Frances McDormand) is a remarkably well rounded character. The narrative finds no problem telling us all we need to know about Mildred through spectacular show-not-tell storytelling and she wins over the audience within the first handful of minutes of being on screen. Mildred shows humanizing strengths and weaknesses which come off as gripping, inspiring, and at some points - heart wrenching. <br/><br/>Dixon (Sam Rockwell) has a role in the story of a scummy, bigoted, racist cop who's morally despicable behavior leave the audience disgusted by his actions, but as the narrative goes forth and we learn about Dixon he becomes one of the most compelling characters we've seen in film in recent memory.<br/><br/>Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) brings forth a charm, fun, charisma which serve as light and tension breaking warmth in some of the darker or more tense scenes in the film. Woody Harrelson completely brings Willoughby to life and his magnetic personality makes him a treat to watch anytime he's on screen.<br/><br/>Besides those three main characters, we also see superb performances from some of the supporting characters - namely Caleb Landry Jones playing Red Welby, Kerry Condon playing Pamela, and Abbie Cornish playing Anne. The script along with the actors' dedication to their characters make for a certainly gripping cast of characters.<br/><br/>While there's only one or two things about the story that prevent this movie from being a solid 10 in my eyes, there's still just so much to admire with the storytelling, cinematography, and direction with this film. It's a fully cohesive story which doesn't waste any time and definitely does not overstay it's welcome. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri makes for a great character study given the depth and the arcs we go through with the characters and this film is certainly one of the best of 2017, highly recommend checking this one out."

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","3","10 April 2018"," Bleak black humor and crime
","A very sad and sinister story in a small town in Missouri, bleak indeed. The drama of a mother whose daughter was raped while dying and then carbonized, burnt down to ashes or a pile of incinerated bones. The police in that Midwest place is unable to find the culprit since his DNA does not correspond to anything they have in any listing you can imagine. The culprit has never been tested for any crime by any police force or for health problems in any hospital or clinic. <br/><br/>After a year the mother decides to attack the police and put their nose in their own mess with three blood-red billboards wondering what the local chief of police is doing. That starts a whole series of events in a city where, as the chief of police under severe pancreatic cancer says before dying, the police is a bunch of racist cops except three and yet two of these are gay. They actually do not really care and their main method to keep peace in the valley, or the town, is to intimidate everyone into silence and obedience, in one word, humility, discretion, submission to the rule of keeping hushed up. <br/><br/>But the whole city then explodes because of the billboards, then the death of the chief of police. His substitute thinks he has to intimidate everyone around the mother and her ex-husband thinks it is better to burn the three billboards down. To no avail, even when the substitute Dixon throws out of his office window the real estate agent who owns the billboards and sold their use to the mother. And upon such events, a black chief of police is sent from the capital city to take over the police station. A black man, mind you.<br/><br/>That will not stop the mother, Mildred by the way, who will put the billboards and the posters back up, with the complicity of some black people, and she will also throw four or five Molotov cocktails at the police station burning it not completely down to the ground but badly enough to require the Fire Department to send some trucks and firefighters.<br/><br/>And yet a false trail will appear and Dixon and Mildred will decide to clean up that chap because he is a rapist for sure, and will have to drive to Idaho, just one thousand miles or so, to clean up the plate. But the real culprit will still be running in the community of Ebbing, unknown of anyone, or maybe, probably, for sure, known to many people who consider that Mildred deserves her sorrow and pain because she is a hard lady with many people.<br/><br/>That's what life is in the Midwest in the USA. Racism, homophobia, male chauvinism and all type of violence against anyone who is weak enough to be assaulted. And the police count the corpses and let the river run under the bridge.<br/><br/>Sad indeed, even if it is so gross at times that it becomes some kind of a thrilling farce, a police vaudeville, a crime comic melodrama. To enjoy one night, but be sure you are wrong if you think those are Trump supporters. They are just redneck supremacists.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
"natalierosen-81679","9","1","3","10 April 2018"," Not a who done it film
","Most probably know, generally, this film involves a mother (Frances McDormand) whose daughter was killed and raped, in that order, in Ebbing, Missouri and its police inability to solve the heinous crime. It is about a woman's justifiably insatiable anger, played brilliantly by Frances McDormand, and her indefatigable attempt to force the police to keep looking for the murderer of her daughter by putting up three billboards (at considerable cost) asking essentially why the Ebbing Police have not solved the murder yet.<br/><br/>If one was expecting a ""who done it"" film that leaves the viewer satisfied at the end by the murder's capture then one should not see this movie. It is substantively, I think, about much more than that.<br/><br/>I believe the film is about anger and a human being's inability to satiate its imprisoning grip. I believe this film is omni applicable not only to those who have lost loved ones through the violent acts of another but also to nation states whose occupants carry insatiable anger that compels them to commit the most heinous and illegal acts against another without guilt. One need only look at the recent horrific poisoning of children in Syria by nerve gassing them to death. What could possibly justify this act that compels men to commit this crime against humanity? <br/><br/>In ""Billboards"" it is said by one that ""anger begets anger"" and so it does. Its cousin revenge is man's attempt to quell the rage within by lashing out at another perceived to be the perpetrator. Seldom through the ages, does ferocious anger get resolved. <br/><br/>Where and when does the anger end? Where is its peaceful resolution? In Ebbing, Missouri Mildred's anger is diffused .... a bit .... through the kindness, empathy and forgiveness of others. Luke 6:29: ""And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other to him."" How many of us are able to do that? I think ""Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri"" was a film and a great one about anger and its resolution through the help of others from whom one might be least likely to expect help. <br/><br/>We should learn how to resolve our anger both singularly and as a nation as it is three minutes to midnight. We have a president who has never resolved his anger perhaps at his father although who knows. Worrisome is this sadistic narcissist seems itching to press the button that would end all of man's problems while ending all life on earth itself."

"aaronlbacks","8","1","3","21 March 2018"," Impervious story telling
","This is a great example of taking a simple concept and writing a fully fleshed out and just BANGIN story out of it. Everything just progresses so logically and tightly and cohesively it's just UGH. I just love how each piece was so thoughtfully crafted and selected and how events unfold and characters react. Zero loose strings whatsoever. Rich and powerful symbolism interspersed, but not too overpowering - the story always came first. The way it toys with expectations several times throughout the film on several different story elements. Really this movie should have won best original screenplay over The Shape of Water but oh well it's the Oscars what can you do? And not only all of that, it introduces some of the best and most loveable characters of 2017 - Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand - who won best actress, which I thought should have been given to Sally Hawkins for The Shape of Water but whatever, at least both films won something in some sense), William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell - who won best supporting actor), Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones), and really the list goes on from here. And it walks perfectly the dark comedy line without ever straying down a road that's too sad or down a comedic part that doesn't forget the morbid overarching plot. The only other film that straddles this gap any better from this year is The Killing of a Sacred Deer - my favorite movie from 2017. The only real detractor from this movie I felt was the way that the characters interacted. It's funny how much inspiration this film takes from Flannery O'Connor - thematically and aesthetically. I love her short stories but I have always had a problem with the characters feeling that they were a little shallow or they knew what the next line someone would say before they said it, or perhaps the feeling they knew they were in a story. It's hard to explain, but her stories have a feel to them. I suppose I'm getting at the fact that this story is so deeply seated in reality, I think it's weird how characters talk like a Shakespearean play in that they aren't only talking to someone on stage, but projecting to the audience. This also contributes to the tone being a little wobbly throughout too. Either way, it's a minor nitpick and doesn't stop this movie from being one of my favorites of the year. Brilliant movie!"

","What a fascinating and powerful drama! Without spoiling any details of the story, it was about a woman, based in a small town Ebbing, Missouri, who had lost her child owing to a hideous crime, and had decided to challenge the local authorities to investigate into the murder of her daughter. <br/><br/>To prompt such investigation, she had rented three massive billboard asking a rather straightforward question: who is accountable for such grotesque crimes? This led a wave of fury amongst the local town people, who showed their support to the local sheriff, and questioned the motive of the mother. Laying it out there serves as a hotbed of back-and-forth drama (and ensuing mistrust) between the local police and the woman, in question. <br/><br/>The star of the film, for me, was the cop played by Sam Rockwell, who is absolutely detestable to watch at the beginning of the film. Not because of his questionable practices (in one instance, he beats billboard owner for the reasons that have no bearing on a crime or an offence) but because of his redeeming qualities. His character represents one of those stubborn individuals who are so set in their ways that they cease to understand the world around them. They know that something is inherently wrong with their thinking but they continue to indulge in it anyway without any regard to the people or things around them. And as I said earlier, it was the redeeming quality - and its realisation of it - that made me love the character towards the second half of the film. <br/><br/>The movie is peppered with black humour throughout, and evokes all sorts of emotions: empathy, rage, frustration, and finally, hope. For me it was the best film of the last year and it should have won the best picture at the Oscars. <br/><br/>I highly recommend it."

"Mohican15","9","1","3","14 March 2018"," An Incredibly Powerful Movie!
","I REALLY have to say how this film just hit the ball straight out of the park! THREE BILLBOARDS is one of the most powerful and thought-provoking films I've seen in a long time. Director Martin McDonagh has delivered an incredibly raw and real movie. His directing and writing are both frankly awesome! He directs an absolutely brilliant cast but also writes an amazing script. THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI is a masterpiece in dramatic writing. It's a very talky script, almost like something from the Cohen Brothers but carries real emotional weight and grit. There is room and backstory for every single character and the film becomes perfectly fleshed-out. Obviously, this was a film about a mother's search for justice but it was more about grief and how people deal with loss, it's also a powerful reminder that there are thousands of stories just like this and (I think) urges that we take care of eachother. The film was about as raw and real as you can get, in a disturbing and quite depressive way. It's no walk in the park, but the way in which the story is told is just SO powerful and moving. The plot is simple, but keeps an even pace and DOES grip. You get a perfect look at each character and how they feel and think. This however, is totally in debt to the jewel of a cast and I have chosen the three main standouts: Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson. <br/><br/>Frances McDormand gives an absolutely titanic performance as the film's tortured heroine Mildred. She is beyond convincing and is totally authentic. McDormand plays a woman TOTALLY consumed by grief, and who (quite understandably) cannot see past her quest for justice that has taken over her entire life. It's a very emotional performance with McDormand TOTALLY giving it her all. It's the way she delivers her lines but also her facial expressions that make the performance SO alive and vivid. Without a doubt, she has earned both her Bafta and her Oscar. Sam Rockwell delivers a truly epic performance as well as the racist Officer Dixon. He begins as a moronic bully, who you actually grow to really loathe. Someone, who totally abuses their position in society and becomes more of an armed thug than a officer of the law. However, after several events he undergoes a drastic character change and becomes soft-spoken, more caring and you actually grow to really like him. Rockwell is extremely convincing as he portrays all of these emotions and gives a really strong performance. Woody Harrelson is another strong, but frankly heartbreaking performance in this film as Chief Willoughby, a man suffering with terminal cancer. Harrelson definitely gives one of his best performances as Willoughby. He says it all with looks, showing real pain and sadness and becomes a character that we really care about.<br/><br/>Both the acting and script move the film along to it's ending. The ending is curious and rather inconclusive but when I left the cinema, I thought that it HAD actually ended where it should have. Obviously, people will compare the main Oscar movies and say which is better, in this case: THE SHAPE OF WATER VS THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI. Here's my opinion, the superior film is without a doubt THREE BILLBOARDS. The performances and plot is just on another level, but I HAVE to say that in terms of enjoyment, SHAPE OF WATER wins for me, primarily because, though I REALLY admired this film, it did leave me a little depressed and with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth due to the brutally tragic plot. However, this film is incredibly powerful and has really earned it's nominations and wins. <br/><br/>I don't watch or like horror but this is the film that should have been called MOTHER!"

","In the sparsely populated town of Ebbing, Missouri, divorced mother Mildred Hayes still grieves over the rape and murder of her teenage daughter which occurred several months earlier. Disgusted by the lack of progress in the investigation to apprehend the perpetrator, she takes matters into her own hands and purchases three billboards along the highway in an attempt to light a fire under the local authorities, but instead finds herself engaged in a personal war with the authorities and the enraged townspeople who see her as a vigilante. Bleak, isolated, and provocative drama from director Martin McDonagh is perfectly cast and completely unpredictable, with scintillating dialogue, tense character interactions, and a believable examination of human nature in the most dire of circumstances. McDormand is remarkable as the stone-faced mother who makes some morally questionable decisions, and Rockwell is tremendous in a complex role as an angry, bigoted officer who's not as one-dimensional as he initially seems. ***"
"bharaths-435-14892","9","1","3","11 March 2018"," Simple and Messy - but very beautiful
","'Three billboards' isn't what you think it will be. IMDb calls it a 'crime/drama' film. I went in expecting a story centering on how a vengeful and distraught mother exposes laziness and/or incompetence in the police force, spurs action from the authorities, and through the sheer absurdity of having erected billboards, manages to achieve her objectives. <br/><br/>Unexpectedly, what I ended up seeing was an absolute masterpiece. It is something like this: Frances McDormand (Mildred Hayes) appears to be a resolute and stubborn character, that part was accurate. She lives in a small town in the 'heartland' of America. Her life and world are surrounded by broken, bumbling and childish characters, who react viciously and churlishly to her decisions throughout the movie. A chaos-infused series of events ensues (after the billboards are put up) and the movie is full of dark moments of humor. What happens in the end is not what you expect, but hopefully mid-way through the movie, you have realized that it isn't really a 'crime/drama' - it is much, much more than that and deserves to live outside of the traditional storytelling conventions. <br/><br/>Woody Harrelson was enjoyable as the police chief. You are so prepared to hate and despise him at first that you don't know what to make of it when you see his helplessness and earnestness come through, suddenly and completely. Likewise, Sam Rockwell delivers a masterful performance as a dangerously empowered man-child with a deep-rooted racial bias. Others come and go - Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes (haven't seen him in anything meaningful since 'eastbound and down') and - surprise surprise, Peter Dinklage. All of these actors do justice and more to their roles, and you end up being hungry for more from each one of them. <br/><br/>The highlight of course, is Frances McDormand herself and her portrayal of a hated woman. There is a particularly powerful scene at the end where she falls to her knees and breaks into tears. That is when you truly see her for what she is: a wounded and scarred woman, and a heartbroken mother acting out of sheer desperation. You badly want her to get justice, but after 1.5+ hours of 'Three Billboards outside...', you of course know by now that justice doesn't just get awarded to those who deserve it or appear to want it, or even need it. Justice is a meaningless term, and is most likely happenstance (as Woody Harrelson articulates well, in a surprising scene). <br/><br/>There is a big message in the movie though. It is woven in very subtly, but hard to miss once you realize what is happening. And the message is that small-town America is a complex and messy world, that should be taken for what it is. For those trying to idyllically glorify it by using poetic and dramatic terms - please learn from these characters, and their broken lives and mental frameworks. There is deep-rooted bias of every kind that appears institutionalized and very very hard to remove, and permeates into almost all walks of life, as shown by some of the leads in the movie. At the same time, for those dismissing rural towns' inhabitants as simple or menial fools, the earnestness and realism of these characters should hopefully change your view. Their lives, dreams, troubles and hopes hit you hard, and hopefully we take away lessons of our own from them."

I was totally captivated by this brilliant film. It was definitely: smart, thought provoking, funny, well written, well written, sad,funny...it was just everything.

It's a sometimes funny movie, even though comedy is not the focal point, but the entire movie is just highly entertaining and pleasant to watch. The amount of haters on IMDb here is just ridiculous. I guess those people just have a pretty pathetic life, and couldn't see quality if you shoved their face in it. I watch two or three movies per day, yes I have nothing else to do and I'm proud of it, and I can say that this is one I will watch again in the future.

","Martin McDonagh has his virtues and his flaws.

His flaws are his lack of ear for dialogue and his mommy issues. All are on display here.<br/><br/>This movie is a good exploration of the rage that can be engendered by grief. Frances McDormand gives a gritty, powerful performance. I didn't find Sam Rockwell's character to be realistic, though, and some of the events stretched credulity. There's a scene or two lifted straight out of some of McDonagh's previous works. <br/><br/>It's an engaging, meticulous movie and I enjoyed it.

","Dead man Willoughby here...Three Billboards is a great movie but maybe a bit less important than it thinks it is...It has a great cast and the acting is fantastic, though. Of course Frances McDormand is in it. As it's her kind of movie and plot. It has a Cohen brothers feel to it. This movie somewhat reminds me of ""Out of the Furnace"" but not as dark and honestly not as good in the least. ""Out of the Furnace"" is an example of a masterpiece in the genre, ""Three Billboards"" is a close follower, though much less a thriller. Many have said the editing is ""flawless"" in this movie. As far as continuation of situations and scenes, it is. But, As a horror writer and director, what stood out to me IS some poor editing in other aspects. You know, muting some dialog or the second layer of sound but you can still clearly see peoples mouths moving.. I get the director tries to angle the shots so the mouths are slightly out of view but on many angles the wordless mouths are still seen. I know this happens in pretty much literally every movie but this is one of the ones where it stands out. Aside from that, we are treated with a homey down south feeling. This is not really a movie about finding the person(s) responsible, but rather the actions and consequences of ones actions to a devastating event. Its a story about hardened greif and making the right choices. Honestly, I don't understand why everyone is rating it so high but it still doesn't deserve a low rating either. It certainly isn't worthy of its 8.3 imdb rating. I'd say its more of a 7 or 7.1"

","The first half-hour or so vacillates somewhat, going around in apparent circles, but TBOEM delivers quite well in the end. This film is everything a noir comedy should be. It's satirical of many things: love, marriage, family, small town life, small town cops and police-in-general, life and mortality, younger people, and older people. Though, like most noir films, TBOEM is VERY profane, gritty, and violent, a subtle compassion and a definite moral ultimately comes through, and it avoids the pitfall of simply being tasteless for the sake of being tasteless. Fine acting by just about the entire cast, with special kudos going to Frances McDormand and Caleb Jones. Fittingly ironic soundtrack too. The one or two brief scenes which digress from the steady dark humor of the rest of the film are well-done and effective, as is the beautiful scenery and cinematography. Finally, it's extremely gripping, always making you wonder what will happen next, with many surprises.<br/><br/>Some of the more critical reviews have noted the various plot-holes in this film, which cannot be denied, but hey, it's comedy, which allows for more than the usual suspension of disbelief. TBOEM easily gets away with its stretches in the end."

"matthewssilverhammer","8","1","3","2 February 2018"," A Mess...An Entertaining, Provocative Mess
","McDonagh (In Bruges) revels in shoving tragedy and comedy right against each other, and he does so with immense ease and an awareness that that delicate balance of the two is what real-life is made of. With Three Billboards, he's trying to marry that authenticity with a heightened sense of storytelling, specifically in the stylized dialogue and detailed characters. This exercise results in some inescapable messiness throughout the movie, yet there's so much compelling and highly entertaining filmmaking on display here you barely notice.
McDormand turns in a powerhouse performance as a vengeful Midwestern mom who buys three billboards in her town that shame local law enforcement for not doing enough to find the man who raped and killed her daughter. With dark subject matter and colorful humor bedding together, it's not an easy movie to take in. Yet despite the film's groove taking a minute to find, those complexities that make it difficult are what make it great. A lovely look at what small-town America really acts like, the characters' motivations and intentions are revealed slowly, and there's not a bad performance in the bunch. Harrelson's character is strongly upright yet deeply sad, and Rockwell brings immense depth to his racist, drunk Barney Fife role.
And the film's edges are as rough as its characters. Metaphors are thinly veiled, characters change when needed, subtext becomes text. However, because the movie, at its core, is just a morality tale, everything is there to support its main point: tragedy changes lives, but vengeance destroys them. And luckily that central message is more open-ended, allowing the movie to sit with its audience long after the individual issues have been washed away."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","1 February 2018"," A must-see that must win many awards
","When so many movies are franchise works or sequels or remakes, it's such a pleasure to find a genuinely original film like ""Three Billboards"". The plotting is unconventional with unexpected developments and most of the characters are complex (unfortunately two young women are presented as stereotypically dumb and a black cop as overly honourable).<br/><br/>This is a social drama in the vein of ""Manchester By The Sea"" where the central characters are suffering great pain and anguish but, unlike the earlier film, what starts with a sense of vengeance ends in a kind of redemption. Much of the credit for the movie's success has to go to the British Martin McDonagh who both wrote and directed, as he did in 2008 for ""In Bruges"", but he is well-deserved by an excellent cast.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand, Academy Award winner for ""Fargo"", is simply brilliant as Mildred Hayes, the mother of a girl who - as the middle of the three billboards states uncompromisingly - was ""raped while dying"". Although she initially has the viewer's unqualified sympathy, we are soon treated to words and actions from her that make clear that this is a woman who will say or do almost anything to advance what she sees as a righteous cause.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson and especially Sam Rockwell give subtle performances as good cop and bad cop respectively in the Ebbing police station and, as the story develops, they - like Mildred - do not behave as you would expect. There is much physical and mental pain in this tale but also some black humour and unusual friendships. A real must-see.<br/><br/>Note: There is no Ebbing in Missouri and the film was largely shot in Sylva in North Carolina. The film has echoes of a use of billboards in a similar fashion over a long period in a place called Vidor in Texas where the killer has still not been identified."

","3 Billboards
In a departure from our usual diet of super heroes and starfighters, we toddled off to see a movie called ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". It was in fairness my choice because I'd seen the shorts (Americans call it a trailer) and I thought it looked pretty funny in a bad language/knee-lifting tough-chick kinda way.<br/><br/>It is about a woman, Mildred, whose daughter was raped and murdered by person/persons unknown some 7 months previously, and who is despairing of the lack of progress in the hunt for the killer/s. Fair to say it is not your standard comedy fare. She berates the local law enforcement officers by taking out a lease on 3 billboards on a road less travelled and using them to query their efforts. Names are named; questions are asked.<br/><br/>The good burghers of Ebbing, Missouri are miffed, particularly given that the much loved Chief of Police (CoP) is mentioned by name. The CoP has significant problems of his own. In the interests of those who have not seen the movie, I shall not reveal the nature of these problems. Suffice to say they are resolved. He is married to an Australian of whom I was previously unaware.<br/><br/>Mildred's billboards attract media attention. News crews appear. Live crosses end badly.<br/><br/>Tyrion Lannister is in it too and he reprises his GoT panty-burgling persona. I hesitate to comment upon his success. But.....nah. <br/><br/>There is a really BAD cop (rBc) whose really-badness has clearly Freudian roots. One may ask, with some justification, ""aren't they all?"" but that would be a digression too far. He tortures prisoners but justifies it in an oddly correct way.<br/><br/>There is a priest who lectures Mildred on the morality of her billboarding and has pointed out to him that, as a priest, morality is something of a touchy issue, regardless of whether he was a touchy priest.<br/><br/>There is an ex-husband who is prone to violence and partial to young zoo keepers. Mildred too is prone to very significant violence. She is not a woman to be crossed. There is a son whose school life deteriorates as Mildred's war develops.<br/><br/>Is it resolved? Are murder(ers) found and justice visited upon them? <br/><br/>I shall not say.<br/><br/>Is it any good? It is so dissimilar as to be incomparable to the benchmark 'Starship Troopers' although both are morality tales. But yes, it IS good, and well worth a Senior's discount. And were we so blighted, worth a full price ticket (FPT)! High praise indeed.<br/><br/>There are genuinely funny bits in a comedy I'll describe as black because I can't think of anything darker."

If not the cliched story, there is enough bulbs of entertainment and social issue treatment to consume here that is topped with some of the most fabulous performances of the year. Woody Harrelson joins the talented cast as the police chief who is torn between the mother's rebellious stunt - iconic in the movie and for the next few decades - and a personal issue to drive the crisply-written film that mocks the law enforcement system and reinforces the theory that man is the biggest and most powerful killer. Other than few slips in Martin McDonagh's writing towards the end, there's not a dull moment in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, MIssouri which, if not too cinematic, has some great billboard design and a ritzy ad agency office. Watch it for its relevant theme, incredible performances, the subtle references that are so highly relatable, and the basic idea that of those billboards. TN."

","With all the reviews etc. gleaned prior to watching this film, I was still surprised, many times, absolutely delightfully.<br/><br/>The opening background score is immediately captivating, a heart-rending rendition of ""The last rose of summer"". Later, it is employed once more, serving as the background music to the most stunning scene in the entire film. Together with the hauntingly mesmerizing soprano as background, the story-telling and emotion-spilling montages are devastating. Devastation that will guarantee to be the most treasured cinematic moment you have ever experienced.<br/><br/>Because of the devilishly clever plot, I'll have to stop outlining it at about the midpoint, after which you will be delighted again and again by twists and turns that you have not anticipated, or have anticipated but turn out a little differently. I like to borrow something I read about Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Mikado"":<br/><br/>(quote) The plot is so ingeniously devised that it runs smoothly as a well-oiled machine; so smoothly, indeed, that its cleverness in construction tends to be overlooked. Of no other work can it be aptly said that ""one thing leads to another"" (end quote)<br/><br/>Almost a year has gone by and Mildred's (Frances McDormand) daughter's murder remains unsolved. She rents three billboards on a desolate highway, posting ""Raped While Dying"", ""And Still No Arrest"", ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?"". The challenged Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) is named for only one reason: ""the buck stops at the top"". He is, offbeat sarcasm notwithstanding, a most decent law enforcing officer. As well, he has been given only a few more months to live, at the terminal stage of his cancer. His loving wife Anne (Abbie Cornish) is facing this predicament with courage, trying to make his last days with their two lovely pre-teen daughters cheerful. Mildred's anger is really against some of Willoughby's lazy and racist staffs, personified in Dixon (Sam Rockwell). After divorce, Mildred lives with her son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) and daughter, now murdered. Ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkers) has taken up a 19-year old girlfriend Penelope (Samara Weaving). There are quite a few more characters, the most noticeable of which, in term of the actor, is Peter Dinklage as the town's maybe only dwarf inhabitant. I'll stop here.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable things about this film is that there are no clear heroes or villains - almost everybody is flawed and, at the same time, has redeeming qualities. Characters develop and evolve throughout the film, oscillating between earning your disgust and your sympathy, very much like characters in The Game of Thrones. Another good example is Thomas Barrow (an under-butler?) in Downton Abbey. You wouldn't have thought that someone you so despise at Season 1 would have you rooting for so whole-heartedly in the final season, six years later. ""Three Billboards"" achieves that effect for Dixon within a timespan of two hours.<br/><br/>Without giving away all the spoilers, there is not much that I can elaborate on to stress how brilliantly the characters are written to interact and bring out the complex but realistic relationship of anger, hate, love, redemption. The brilliance is in using dark humor rather than manipulative tear-jerkers. The Coen brothers could not have done it better than director Martin McDonagh here. In one scene a character that had been beaten up badly is show in hospital bed wrapped up like a half-mummy, ""half"" because his face is still recognizable and he can still move around, even if limping and with only one arm mobile. Then, another patient is rolled into the room, a complete mummy this time and the nurse says to introduce the new roommate ""Burnt victim, heavily sedated"". After the nurse left, he brings over a juice (in a glass, with straw) to try to comfort his new roommate the burnt victim, who is still conscious and, staring out of the two holes in the bandages that completely covers his face, repeatedly says ""I'm sorry"". It takes a while for the first patience to realize that the burnt victim is the guy who savagely beat him up less than 24 hours ago. The expression on his face alone (half exposed face) is good enough for an Oscar, and this is just a minor character. Torn between hate and sympathy, he finally brings the juice to the burn victim's bed. The final shot in this scene says so much with so little - after a little hesitation, he carefully turns the straw in the glass around so that the burnt victim can reach it more easily. There are such top-notch scenes aplenty.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand's Mildred in all likelihood will win her as many film awards as Gary Oldman's Churchill. Hard-as-nail does not even being to describe one layer of her character. And yet, look at this very early scene in the office where she is renting the billboards, which shows an insect on its back, struggling. Later, we see Mildred nonchalantly flipping it over, saving its life - another layer of her character. But there are many more, and McDormand brings them all out, without the slightest trace of acting.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson is having a good year, in ""The glass castle"", then in this film, with a performance that will have you laugh out loud and break your heart, at the same time. As mentioned, Sam Rockwell won Golden Globe best support, but Harrelson is equally deserving. Rockwell's advantage is in that his type of explosive character registers more easily with audience. I would be really disappointed if Oscar does not recognize both of them with nominations as BAFTA has done.<br/><br/>Of the entire solid support cast, several deserve a special mention. Abbie Cornish, if I am allowed to quote Muhammad Ali's self-assessment, is not just a pretty face. She has amply demonstrated her versality in the variety of roles in Bright Star (still considered by many as her signature work) and Seven Psychopaths (another of Director McDonagh's widely acclaimed work). Here her portrayal of the loving wife and mother who is about to lose her husband rises above banal sentimentality. Truly heartbreaking. Lucas Hedges, at 20, was recognized by Oscar with a best supporting nomination in ""Manchester by the sea"". Here, playing Mildred's son who has survived growing up in a defunct family with toughness and a dark sense of humor, he has some wickedly offbeat scenes with McDormand. Another Oscar nominee John Hawkes (in ""Winter's Bones"", the movie that provides the first step for Jennifer Lawrence stardom) plays Mildred's ex-husband, with malice but no exaggeration. Already mentioned is Peter Dinklage whose attentive, measured performance of James the town dwarf whose small part plays a pivotal role in plot development. Interestingly the character that is pure goodness is the clueless 19-year old girlfriend Penelope played lovingly by Samara Weaving. <br/><br/>Ultimately, despite everything, this film is about love. Discover it in one of the three letters written by one of the key characters in the film."
"adrian-43767","7","1","3","16 January 2018"," Ultimately uneven, despite superlative acting
","THREE BILLBOARDS is a well-intentioned film that exposes social wounds and, above all, what individual anger and vindictiveness can do. The idea is great, putting up three large billboards to draw attention to a young girl's rape and murder, but the plot begins to falter quite rapidly, with far too many actors with individual problems and not enough drive to air them, let alone solve them.<br/><br/>The script leaves much to be desired, with obvious credibility loopholes. It reminds me of FARGO, but with far less humor and a much greater foreboding that everybody stands to lose, regardless of what happens.<br/><br/>Action sequences and photography are highly competent. The cherry on the cake is the acting. Mc Dormand is superb. Harrelson, in a much smaller part, sublime, functioning almost as the all-seeing eye and authority, even if he cannot catch the killer and is dying of cancer. Both deserve to be nominated for Oscars, at the very least.<br/><br/>Although his is a highly engaging performance, I found Sam Rowell's part rather thankless, and his character repellent, as a cop who has his private set of rules and is not smart enough to realize that his anger will cost him. He seems to be changing into someone more thoughtful by movie's end, and that's perhaps one of the film's stronger messages - that revenge really gets you into more trouble than it helps.<br/><br/>The film also includes a completely unnecessary, and malicious, attack on the Catholic Church, without any connection to any other part of the film. One can only wonder what Director McDonagh has against the Catholic Church but his hatred clearly runs very deep. His direction is less than inspired and ultimately uneven. With such a stellar cast, he should have invested in a better script, one that does not cop out on an open ending. 7/10"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","1","3","15 January 2018"," A brazen, no-holds-barred character study that's actually quite life-affirming in its own sardonic sort of way.
","While it can feel a bit aimless thanks to its general narrative looseness and lack of persistent point-to-point plot, this brazenly tone-twisting tale takes no prisoners on its no-holds-barred bid to offend just about everyone it can while aiming to remind those same people that just because a character (not the film or its creators, I might add) thinks or even acts a certain way doesn't always mean they can't be redeemed. In this way, its overall messages are actually quite inspiring, optimistic and, dare I say, sort of hopeful, even if the feature is generally a rather downbeat and hopeless affair right until its final, suitably low-key frame. It's an experience that feels like it has something significant to say about grief, with the lasting impression being strangely life-affirming in its own uniquely sardonic kind of way, and the almost second-to-none character work on display is truly phenomenal on all sides, to the point where almost every inhabitant of the eponymous town felt like a breathing human being. That's really the main effect you get from the piece, allowing you to spend time with people you wouldn't really want to spend time with but in the process come to truly understand them, and it's rare for a work to accomplish such a connection - especially with characters who's ethics are as questionable as these. 7/10"

A much better ending to 3 Billboards.... in the last scene as Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were driving out of town they started talking about whether it was a good idea to go all the way to Idaho.... and then it just ended. Everyone in the theater was like.... HUH?!<br/><br/>What they could have done is have Jason Dixon (Rockwell) say, ""We could go on or we could stay here and continue to work on this together""..... and then you see a camera shot (from above) of the car coming to a stop.... and then the camera pans over, fades out, and then fades in on the 3 Billboards.... which say in order: 
1. ""We're coming for you""..... with a picture of the mom, Mildred Hayes (McDormand), and 
2. 2nd billboard has pic of Jason Dixon, with words under his name of ""Private Investigator"", and
3. 3rd billboard has pic of Woody Harrelson, with his name of Sheriff Willoughby.... and msg, ""We will find you"". <br/><br/>So Mildred completely goes 180 on the Sheriff because he gave her the $5000, and honors him by including him on the 3rd billboard. The message is ....He's on our team.... in spirit.... and we will find you. <br/><br/>This is an ACCEPTABLE way to end the film if you're actually not going to find the killer. If I can think of this why the heck couldn't the producers, writer, or director think of this?!"

","I am a fan of frances mcdormand,so i went to this film hoping to see a performance rivaling sally hawkins in ""the shape of water."" no contest: sally hawkins is transcendent; mcdormand is good. well, in one scene she is great: the remembered fight with her daughter is fantastic. blows away any of the highly praised mother-daughter scenes in ""lady bird."" 
the role of dixon's mother is unpleasant but extremely well acted.
on the other hand, the plot twist makes no sense. we see a vicious psychopath boast of killing a girl - almost certainly the daughter - then worry that he was overheard. turns out he is not the killer. ok, novel twist, but if he is just boasting, not the killer, why was he so worried about being overheard? and we see him shockingly violent twice, yet his fingerprints are in no law enforcement database, local or national. clean record? not likely.
why does chief willoughby write detailed letters telling mildred but not his wife that mildred is not responsible for his suicide? the only reason i can see is to set up a scene where the wife is furious at mildred. pretty catty for the kind chief willoughby.
i have seen lucas hedges in 3 films in the past year, and he is least compelling here.
i was not moved by woody harrelson's portrayal. yes, i understood that he was supposed to be a good man and a decent person, but i didn't feel it. clarke peters as the replacement police chief was palpably decent; harrelson was not. seemed like the wrong actor for the role. for a decent police chief, i think of chris cooper in ""lone star,"" a great frances mcdormand film. 
mcdonagh sure enjoys killing off good guys (cf in bruges), but he doesn't do it nearly as well as george r.r. martin.
the film is bleak and repeatedly, gratuitously violent and malicious, without justice triumphing in the end - much like ""in bruges,"" which i hated for the same reason."

"Troy_Campbell","7","1","3","3 January 2018"," Unpredictable and moving tale of grief.
","Employing black comedy to explore how a mother mourns for her viciously murdered daughter is not the way most filmmakers would tackle such a tough subject. But subversive UK writer-director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) is not like most filmmakers. Taking the path less travelled at every opportunity, McDonagh confounds expectations by showing the uncomfortable, unfiltered actions of those trying to come to terms with such a heinous crime. There are no melodramatic, heart-string pulling moments of Hollywood sentimentality here, just pissed off people looking for answers wherever they can find them. The rawness doesn't always work, with a couple of otherwise affecting scenes stumbling due to awkward climactic gags; however, the dark humour (and stubborn aversion to anything resembling normality) successfully turns the film into something of a modern Greek tragedy, and it's compelling viewing. The cast are on point too. Frances McDormand will surely garner an Oscar nomination for her tour de force turn as Mildred, the deceased's mother who'll stop at nothing to get justice, while Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are captivating as two cops with different approaches to the job and their community. Visually it's solid without being overly memorable, but McDonagh and cinematographer Ben Davis do manage to construct an audaciously long and unbroken tracking shot that is breathtaking in its brutality, and an (extremely) early contender for sequence of the year. An unpredictable tale of grief that eschews mawkishness in favour of frankness, Three Billboards is an amusing look at how unfair and crappy life can occasionally be."
"gavinp9","7","1","3","1 January 2018"," Part funny, part bleak, all quite well done.
","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the third film from writer/director McDonagh (of 'In Bruges' & 'Seven Psychopaths' fame), and continues his themes of taking something quite bleak/violent (in this case the murder of a woman's daughter) and building situations with characters around it that can still be funny. Mildred (McDormand) is the focus here, and she rents three billboards from Red (Landry Jones) to call out the police for not finding her daughter's murderer, so Chief Willoughby (Harrelson) is put in a tight spot.<br/><br/>Dixon (Rockwell) is one of his cops and has a great part as the dimwitted, slightly-bigoted younger cop. McDormand is exceptional as the ultra-focused and hard-nosed grieving mother, with a few layers. Harrelson is also good, but Cornish as his wife has the weirdest Australian/Southern accent mash-up I've ever heard! And the age-gap there is hard to comprehend... The only shame is Dinklage doesn't get more screen time, but still good seeing him.<br/><br/>It's odd that it was all filmed in North Carolina, not Missouri, as there's some beautiful scenery shots that definitely don't look like St Louis! Also worth noting that Ebbing's not a real place. The mystery and investigation is handled quite well and realistically, but the attention here is on anger - misplaced or otherwise - and how it can consume people and create a destructive cycle. Not the best use of music and not quite a perfect ending, but a very solid film."

Assuming the credits were at least four minutes, I realized either something crazy is going to happen, or nothing is going to happen at all. Nothing happened. I would barely call the end of this movie an ending. Unless it's setting up for some crazy, vigilante, shoot em up sequel. But based on the writer/director's previous work, I doubt it.

I hope that doesn't spoil anything but I will list this review as having spoilers for those who get butthurt way too easily."
"reid-hawk","8","1","3","27 December 2017"," Very solid but somewhat overrated and held back by some bad choices
","Overall I love Martin McDonagh's filmography, and i really enjoy Three Billboards. It's funny, well acted, and (at times) quite compelling and well written. The character development of Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson's characters in particular are honestly one of the best aspects of any movie this year.The way McDonagh chose to film some of the action scenes (the best one being a long single take) is also very well done. Francis McDormand is also a lock for an oscar nomination as is Sam Rockwell. But this film has some glaring, ugly ugly ugly flaws that I'll go through.<br/><br/>1. The CGI deer scene. My. F***ing. God. This scene is so cheesy and awful. The deer looks awful. McDormand's dialogue is awful. The entire scene is just cringe worthy, and, in case you did't guess it, awful. It's easily my least favorite scene of the year in any of the movies in my 2017 top films list.
2. Lucas Hedge is a terrible actor in this film, and I don't understand how. He was pretty amazing in Manchester by the Sea, but here in this movie he just seems so uninterested in even being in the film, even though his dialogue is quite well written and should be easy to portray. The scene where he attacks his father and threatens him with a knife is probably the most unenthusiatic and just plain terrible Lucas could have been in that scene. Every moment the film asks him to do anything he seems unable to convincingly portrait his character.
3. The Ex-husband's comic relief girlfriend is just so unfunny it's unbearable. The rest of the comedy in this movie is solid and feels Coen Brothers' ask, but she just seems like such a generic overly dumb character. I really don't understand what they were going for with her but it never once works
4. There is a scene I enjoy in the movie, where McDormand's daughter's supposed rapist confronts McDormand, and while the scene itself is quite good, I find it pointless within the overall context of the film. I think it easily could have been taken out and the movie and plot would remain unaffected.<br/><br/>Although these critiques might sound harsh, I want to point out I still really liked this film. I think it takes a while for it to really get started, but the complexity of the characters and the sheer talent of the filmmaking and writing in general make this a must see of 2017"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","27 December 2017"," McDonagh's experiment with dark wit and serious crime drama yield intriguing results
","After winning over theatre audiences in the '90s and early 2000s, Martin McDonagh moved into the filmmaking sphere and started racking up even more fans with ""In Bruges"" and the criminally underrated ""Seven Psychopaths,"" two sickly dark comedies lined start to finish with a brilliant albeit twisted humor and sharp dialogue. In ""Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri,"" McDonagh takes those sensibilities and applies them to much heavier, timely subject matters: justice and police accountability. <br/><br/>By infusing a rural crime drama with dark comedy and casting Frances McDormand in the lead role, ""Three Billboards"" will probably earn more than a few sly critics' labels of ""the best Coen Brothers film of the year."" Truthfully, even without McDormand, the comparison would be warranted. McDonagh and the Coens take extremely similar approaches to screenwriting and are drawn to stories about criminals of the unlikely variety. <br/><br/>McDormand stars as Mildred Hayes, a recently divorced woman in the titular town whose daughter was raped and killed several months back. Feeling as though the case has been completely neglected by the local police department, Mildred buys up the advertising space on three long-vacant billboards outside of town and covers them with a statement indicting Chief of Police Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) for inaction. This causes tempers to flare, causing a chain reaction of consequences that go deeper than billboards.<br/><br/>There could very easily be a purely dramatic and serious version of this story, but that's not McDonagh. Naturally he wants to bring in his livelier style (and Tarantino-like propensity for violence) to complement the slower, weightier sentimental elements of the story and it takes a little while for the two to gel. The best representation of this struggle comes in Carter Burwell's score, which drops its excellent Western-inspired folk instrumental motif for melodramatic, sappy piano and flute bits when the film slows down for more contemplative, character-driven moments.<br/><br/>Gluing it all together is a cast loaded with talents that have bounced between comedy and drama before. In addition to Harrelson and McDormand, there's Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage, Caleb Landry Jones, Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes and others who sell both moments of wit and moments of authentic human response. Rockwell in particular as a boneheaded, racist police officer with a violent streak keeps his character believably intact as his pendulum swings in wildly different directions. His character arc will make the film for many and break it for others.<br/><br/>Ultimately, McDonagh's writing is as sharp as ever (the two-toned/double-sided foul language is on point). In terms of storytelling, he does fill the plot with lots of contrivances and moments of happenstance, but they create interesting and meaningful situations that force us to think about anger and violence and justice - all the emotions that we experience when we're in pain - and the choices available to us in terms of how we respond.<br/><br/>Given the way the story presents as this crime mystery about police accountability, it would be legitimate for anyone to feel there's been somewhat of a bait-and-switch in the direction and resolution of the story, if not a complete lack of sensitivity to those issues. That's because at its core, ""Three Billboards"" isn't really about these timely, socially relevant themes or the rape and murder case itself, but about what the case represents to the characters and how it informs their choices. The details don't matter to McDonagh because the film is about something bigger.<br/><br/>In all honesty, that mindset suggests McDonagh's style should probably be reserved to stories that cover less trivial matters, but ""Three Billboards"" gives us enough good insights and performances to warrant the experiment.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

There is limited ""action"", but so must be life in a small place, and, as the events progressed, you expected generally a different solution as you saw on the screen later. Tragic and comic moments are in good symbiosis and the ending is nicely ""open"" - probably not their cup of tea who are fond of usual crime stories - but not creating wtf! or hollow feelings. Simple things have sometimes complicated solutions, yet their depiction is far from simplicity and moralisation. <br/><br/>All in all, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a real gem amidst over-sophisticated and over-flashed films often based on comics (that is why I have moved on from films to series)."

"antoniokowatsch","8","1","4","19 May 2018"," Probably the best movie of 2017
","This movie was really intense. I loved it. Granted, it goes to some dark places but it has an interesting story to tell. The only reason why I've initially put off watching the movie was the title; it sounded kind of boring (but wasn't). Yes, the billboards are an integral part of the story but later the movie evolves past them. So just keep that in mind if you're thinking about giving the movie a watch.<br/><br/>Storytelling-wise the mysterious billboards were introduced in an interesting way. Instead of revealing them right away the billboards were initially obscured from the viewer. This leaves viewers with some time to speculate as to what it might have displayed to get the police officer so riled up. Really well done.<br/><br/>The mother (Mildred) seems to be known by locals which makes sense; I myself grew up in a small town where word traveled fast. An ""everybody knows everybody"" type of affair. So it is authentic in its execution.<br/><br/>The police officers in the movie are clearly corrupted (at least the majority of them). And when the billboards garner the attention of the media things get heated. It's a proverbial declaration of ""war"" so to speak. One dedicated mother against the local police department.<br/><br/>At first Mildred seems irrational and unreasonable towards Willoughby. After all he seems like an OK guy. But as we later find out both are flawed characters with demons to slay. They just deal with their individual situations differently. The loss of Mildred's daughter has made her bitter. And I do get it somehow. She seems very confrontational even with the very people who try to support her in her quest. Willoughby on the other hand is faced with a hard decision because he kept a secret. A secret that literally changes everything.<br/><br/>Dixon, the second protagonist, seems a little ""slow"" but that doesn't absolve him of his ""controversial"" past. He has a track record of ""racial discrimination"" and the locals are well aware of his racist past.<br/><br/>On a side note:
The scene with the dentist was pretty hilarious. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. I don't want to spoil it for you. It was quite unexpected.<br/><br/>
There are some pretty interesting themes that are being explored during the movie. And storytelling-wise I liked that the characters were all multi-faceted.
There is a lot of peripety in the movie. Especially with the whole Willoughby situation. And then there's of course the whole thing with Dixon's redemption.
At heart it's a bittersweet story. It starts out rough around the edges but as the story progresses things become clearer and more refined.<br/><br/>To conclude: It's ultimately a story about forgiveness.
Humbling experiences are the biggest catalyst for change; positive change that is. This in essence is the most prevalent theme of the movie and that's what I like about it. Too many contemporary movies go the traditional ""revenge"" route. And it is getting quite boring after a while. This movie is more profound. Yes, it is a story about revenge, initially, but then seamlessly morphs into something much bigger; a compelling story with strong characters. Even the characters with minor roles felt grand because they were authentic. No role was ""superfluous"". It was a perfect amalgam.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie is for everybody. It does go to some dark places so I'd say that it's probably for people who have a certain level of ""emotional"" maturity. But overall it's a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Final verdict: highly recommended (don't let the lame title fool you)"

","I've always had a bizarre soft spot for desolate America. It's cinematic landscapes, it's seemingly endless time and simplicity, it's atmosphere of the forgotten. Ebbing Missouri has all this. It also has Frances McDormund in all her powerhouse, scene chewing majesty. She's not alone though, the cast here is fantastic! Absolutely, razor sharp, gut punchingly brilliant. This is a serious story though, about rape, murder, injustice, power, corrupt institutions and family values, it's not light hearted whimsy. But make no mistake, if you get into trouble, you want McDormund in your corner. Look up badass in the dictionary and you'll be greeted with a picture of 'Mildred Hayes' staring back at you, ready to deliver a line that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up so far, you'll give the nearest deranged hedgehog a run for its money. All this makes this imminently watchable, with a slew of complex characters living in that aforementioned simple world, every scene delivers beautifully with not a single wrong turn. The script is dynamite, one amazing line after another, ""You do not allow a member of the public to call you fuckhead in this station house"" or ""This time, the chick ain't losin"". Whether it's the unusual verbal dexterity of Rockwell or the facial inferences from Harrelson, despite the seriousness of the crimes surrounding this story, the black humour delivers epic vistas of light and it's absolutely glorious!"
"snitz43","5","1","4","16 May 2018"," If sadistic, dehumanizing films are to your taste, you'll love this.
","It takes a bizarre mindset to be the writer/director of such a sadistic, dehumanizing film, as MDonagh fails in this Cohen Brothers wannabe quest. Of course, 'No Country For Old Men' contained exceptionally macabre violence, but its major perpetrators were hardened criminals, bent police and an arch villain who was akin to those found in a Batman comic. <br/><br/>However, 'Three Billboards' depicts supposedly average middle class characters (albiet very neurotic, racist, abusive etc.) relentlessly perpetratrating vigilante acts of criminal violence. The most sadistic scene is not when Sam Rockwell's character pummeled and hurled an innocent man through a 2nd story office window and then punched a screaming secretary in the face with no mention of charges ever having been raised for these crimes. Nor is it when Frances McDormand's character threw Molotov cocktails into the police station and is provided with a false alibi by a man she subsequently will treat like dirt just for wanting a dinner date with her. <br/><br/>Rather, the most egregious dumbass violence is perpetrated after a school kid hit Frances McDormand's car window with a bottle while at the school's entrance, so McDormand proceeds to viciously kick a silent boy and girl in the crotch. This unnecessary glorification of vigilante overreaction is apparently never even reported. I'd imagine that most folks reading this review would at least be anticipating an investigation. <br/><br/>Alas, McDormand's and Rockwell's Oscar-winning performances makes it too easy for the writer/director to get away with blatant cheatings of the audience such as these. The ""violence begets violence"" admonition is mocked by having these words spoken by a diabolical wife beating sadist and his callow young girlfriend who had recently read it on a bookmark. <br/><br/>In future decades 'Three Billboards' will be placed in the same genre as 'The Birth of a Nation', the 1915 masterpiece of writer/director D. W. Griffith which glorified the Klu Klux Klan and served as a ""justification"" for continued disenfranchisement and mob killings of African Americans for two more generations.<br/><br/>That 'Three Billboards' is cleverly sardonic does not make its ""auteur"" director McDonagh a jot less culpable of exploitating dehumanizing vigilante crimes to boost his fame and fortune."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>It is completely understandable to be angry, frustrated and restless when authorities are unable to apprehend the culprit who violated and murdered your daughter! Renting and posting messages on three billboards on an infrequently traveled road to spur action is a clever move. Many actions the mother does after that are...to put it lightly and not to spoil too much....highly inappropriate and dangerous. She basically calls out the chief of police who you learn early on is dying of cancer. His story arc is rather morbid and the mourning mother is not easy to root for or relate to. I feel this is an overrated film. The story bumbles about, there is an unrealistic and unnecessary amount of vulgarity, many call this a dark comedy yet I didn't crack a smile, certain plot points remain hanging and when the final frame rolled past, I was left unsatisfied. The acting was solid and there were a few nice shots but the story fell short and I failed to emotionally mesh with it."

Her husband was unlikable, and she chose him. I couldn't really root for anyone except the Harrelson character.<br/><br/>A scene near the beginning almost put me off the whole movie, with the sarcastic comment about the ""blank-ing environment"" when the cop said he could arrest the guy for dumping waste on the grass. I don't like glib attitudes toward nature in any context.<br/><br/>When the mother torched the police station all bets were off, and the constant commentary about cops beating up black men seemed like a nod to shady social justice activists.<br/><br/>The best aspect of the movie for me was seeing the crass cop come around and do something decent, but he wasn't exactly redeemed for his earlier rottenness."
"bkoganbing","9","1","4","19 April 2018"," Inconsolable grief
","It's ironic that the first of Frances McDormand's Oscars came for her portrayal of a
sheriff in Fargo. For her second one she plays the antagonist to a sheriff she
feels isn't doing her job. The sheriff is a most popular individual in the town,
Woody Harrelson. But this is a woman with a mission.<br/><br/>None of the people in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri are of any kind of
heroic stature. They're just I suspect as ordinary as any of us with our good points and bad. One of them, Deputy Sam Rockwell is one unapologetic
racist who uses his badge to harass and assault folks of a different skin tone.
He's McDormand's greatest antagonist and in the end the two come to an 
interesting relationship.<br/><br/>McDormand is a mother who just can't accept the loss of her daughter. I'm the
son of one who never got over the loss of her daughter. But my sister died of
natural causes, McDormand's teen daughter went out one night against parental advice and was raped and murdered.<br/><br/>That was months ago and there's no accepting her loss for McDormand. She
got her Best Actress Oscar not just for words spoken, but for some incredible
body language and facial expressions. Her rage at what she sees is the lack of
interest by law enforcement will not be abated.<br/><br/>So what she has done is out of whatever money she has scraped up together is
pay for three large billboards outside the main thoroughfare of the town of
Ebbing, Missouri calling attention to the lack of progress on her daugher's
homicide and getting personal with Chief Woody Harrelson. Harrelson in turn
has some personal problems of a serious nature which the town knows about
and the sympathy that McDormand might have had is turning to resentment 
toward her.<br/><br/>Her grief isn't the only thing that has turned McDormand into the unpleasant
creature she is. Her husband John Hawkes who seems to be no great prize
himself left her for a 19 year old chippie. Her son Lucas Hedges is also feeling
alienated from both parents.<br/><br/>There's no such place as Ebbing, Missouri but the uniformly fine ensemble of
players sure makes you think you're in mid country America looking in on a place that's a cross between Grover's Corner in Our Town and Winesburg, Ohio
in the 21st century. Of course the cast is topped by Oscar winners Frances McDormand for Best Actress and Sam Rockwell for Best Supporting Actor.
Woody Harrelson also got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor
and the film was nominated in a bunch of other categories including Best
Picture.<br/><br/>See this one by all means."

"silvermistvio","3","1","4","27 March 2018"," The film which left the audiences hanging as the story isn't a complete one.
","I only watched this movie because it went to Oscars nomination list and also Golden Globes. I didn't have a high hopes for it because I knew that it will turn out to be a drama and yes, it did. It really turned into a drama.<br/><br/>1) The story. The plot of this film is about a woman who lost her daughter. Her daughter was raped by some guy or some gang and died because of it. But the local police didn't find the person or gang who is responsible for that. So, she wrote this story on three billboards outside their town, Ebbing, Missouri just like the movie title said. The rest of the film focuses on the consequences of her actions. There's nothing much in the plot and because of it turned out to be a drama and I'm not a fan of dramas, so, it's kind of boring. But at least, it's watchable because of the following facts, performances of actors and directing.<br/><br/>2) Performances of the actors and actresses. Their performances are so good, especially the supporting actor, Sam Rockwell as Dixon. When I saw Oscars winners list, I wonder why he got the award. But when I saw his performance in the film, no wonder he got the award. He's such a great actor. I really hated the Dixon character. He's such a jerk.<br/><br/>3) Directing. As I've stated in above, this film is drama and I'm so bored when I watch drama. But I think because of the director, I could watch it without feeling boring. For the whole movie to be great, not only screenplay writer needs to be good, but also the director needs to be great too. Only the director can make the movie great, especially when directing dramas. This film turned out to be not that much boring, because of the director's skill, I guess.<br/><br/>4) Sound editing, sound mixing and editing are at normal. No comment on them.<br/><br/>5) Original Score. The original score used in the film is quite normal. But in the film, it quite fits. But it's not that much good. I guess that's why it didn't get an award.<br/><br/>6) Photography/Cinematography. The story is based on the small town, so, there are no so many beautiful scenes. But photography is great. They could make is beautiful to those scenes even the scenes are not that much beautiful. I was amazed when I saw those scenes. So, I'd say it's quite good.<br/><br/>7) OK, here comes likes and dislikes. What I like in this film is if you've done something bad to other people, you will get the same result someday. That's the nature of karma. They could show it in the film clearly. On the other hand, I don't like the end. I feel like the story didn't end that way. They should have stated who raped her daughter. They only stated the guy that Dixon thought he could be the guy, but he wasn't the one. Dixon sure that he is the guy. And then they stated that guy isn't even in the country when that happened. And, they stated Dixon is right that he has done something like that in the other county, but not here. Then, they stated it's classified. Why is it classified? I don't think it's classified because he's commanding officer. Then Dixon and Mildred went to that guy to kill him. So, here's my question. Did they kill that guy? They should have stated those two facts, who raped her daughter and did they kill that guy? But they didn't. They left the audiences hanging. So, I feel like the story didn't end. There should be much more. <br/><br/>All in all, I really hate those films which left the audience to have several ideas and hanging. So, I'm not that much into this film, but it's watchable and enjoyable, but for only one watch.
(P.S: My opinion ONLY.)"
"michael-young-585","9","1","4","25 March 2018"," Superb Acting
","Oscar Nominations:<br/><br/>Three Billboards is chock-ful of surprises. About the time you think you know what's next, it turns out you were dead wrong and something entirely different happens. It just isn't possible to guess where this movie is going. And that's clearly the fun with this movie.<br/><br/>Although it doesn't really deal with a 'fun' topic. It's mostly about anger. At the beginning of the movie, Mildred Hayes (McDormand's character) has lost her daughter to tragic and disturbing circumstances. Although the local police department has apparently made some effort at solving the case, the DNA evidence leads nowhere and the cops are stymied both by the lack of leads and personal reasons. Mildred, angered by the lack of justice, vents on them.<br/><br/>But anger is a dangerous emotion that often gets channeled in unexpected directions. We never have all the facts and the conclusions we reach, especially in anger, can turn around and bite in the most unforeseen ways. Sometimes the fallout can be funny, as it often is in this movie. But it can also turn tragic, and it does here too.<br/><br/>A huge part of the success of this movie ascribes to Frances McDormand. She won the Leading Actress Oscar for her performance here and, although I haven't seen any of the other nominated performances yet, I can imagine she deserves it. But then, when does she not return a terrific performance? She is best known for playing supporting character roles and was nominated for Supporting Actress Oscars for North Country, Almost Famous, and Mississippi Burning. But probably her most famous role was as Marge Gunderson in Fargo where her understated performance constantly moved back and forth between comedy and drama. She won the Oscar for that performance and brings many of the same characterizations to this role, twenty-two years later.<br/><br/>She does not operate in a vacuum. She has two wonderful supporting actors to play off in this film. Woody Harrelson plays, in his typically droll way, Willoughby, the small town sheriff. Willoughby is really trying hard to make a life for himself, his family, and his town, but is unable to make it due to problems entirely beyond his control. Harrelson has been remarkably active in the last few years, appearing in five other movies released this year, including an 'apocalyptic' role in War for the Planet of the Apes. He has received Oscar nominations for his performance in this movie, as well as in The Messenger, and The People vs. Larry Flynt. His career dates back to his role in 1985 in the TV series Cheers, and has starred in dozens of movies since then. His anger in Three Billboards is perhaps the most inconsolable and is resolved unexpectedly.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell plays the most troubled character, James Dixon, and the one with the most uncontrolled anger. His arises from deep psychological problems generated by a severely dysfunctional family. Dixon's role is pivotal and seems to provide the emotional energy that drives everyone else. Rockwell won the Oscar this year for Supporting Actor and this was his first nomination. Although he has appeared in dozens of movies, almost entirely in supporting roles, I can't say that I recognized him. After his performance here, and his Oscar win, I suspect we will be seeing more of him.<br/><br/>To have three actors in one movie all receiving Oscar nominations (and two of them winning), is not very common. Last movie with ensemble recognition that I can remember would be American Hustle. But what that should tell you is that the acting is tremendous. And when you get three superior actors interacting in the same movie, the effects are enhanced and reinforced. They play off each other to best advantage, and result in a more powerful film. (Shape of Water, the Best Picture winner, also had three actors nominated.)<br/><br/>But, importantly, this isn't just an acting vehicle. Martin McDonagh wrote and directed the film, and received a writing nomination. He also received a Screenplay nomination for In Bruges which shares similar qualities with this movie in tone and story-line. Both films oscillate between comedy and drama, both films have an undercurrent of violence (maybe a tad stronger in the former movie), and both films leave you a little shocked at your own reaction. McDonaghs credits, as both writer and director, are a short list at this point, but he is still young enough that we will likely hear more from him. Although Three Billboards is a good movie, I don't think McDonagh has yet earned an Oscar.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie received two more, below-the-line, nominations, although it did not win either. The Film Editing, by Jon Gregory (who also did In Bruges) was indeed tight, but I think Baby Driver was more successful. And Carter Burwell was nominated for his Original Score. He did the music for Fargo and appears to have some insight into McDormand's characters. He was also nominated for the music for Carol from two years ago. His music is quirky enough to fit the twists and turns of this film.<br/><br/>This movie is far from perfect, as many critic and audience reviews point out. There are so many points in the movie that one could identify as unrealistic and improbable. If you require complete fidelity to the real world, then you are likely to be disappointed in Three Billboards. But if you want to experience a look into how people in today's world handle anger in all its manifestations, then the movie provides both funny and serious food for thought."

"pramsalim","10","1","4","12 March 2018"," Martin McDonagh is Tarantino with dramatic flair
","This movie with one of the weirdest title in recent memory is getting a lot of awards lately. It didn't win the Best Picture oscar but people were putting their money on this movie. The Shape of Water won the Best Picture that night. I wasn't the biggest fan of that movie though, I thought the movie was kind of hollow. This movie, however, was a damn dynamite.<br/><br/>At its core, it was really about the concept of anger and hate. The main character of this movie is an aging lady, Mildred Hayes, who had her daughter murdered in a gruesome way. After the police seemed to give up on the case, she took it upon herself to use the billboard outside her house to write some things about her daughter's murder. This event led to consequences that not only affects the people around her, but also the whole town of Ebbing, Missouri.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, I was constantly glued to the screen. The writing was perfect, the drama was very hard-hitting as well as the dark humor that was peppered throughout the movie. Writings, however, wouldn't mean a damn thing if not performed correctly. The performances in this movie was so affecting. Veteran actors such as Frances McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson, all gave a very conflicted (and funny too, surprisingly) performances. Also, what I liked about this movie was that it touched on the subject of anger and eventually acceptance, but the movie never felt cheesy at all. It delivered the message while still keeping the cynicism that I think is the movie's strongest identity.<br/><br/>I think this is a great movie. I thought it could've won the Original Screenplay Oscar, but that didn't happen too, 'Get Out' won that Oscar. That's okay, though, I like 'Get Out'. Anyways, If you like dark comedies and drama, I think you'll love this movie."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has a heart. A big one. The film is rough and tough on the outside, but has a soft warm core. Just like its characters. They are all flawed. Some more than others. A lot more. They are all damaged. Some more than others. They all have something they feel guilty about. Some more than others. Some have more reason to than others. But they all care about one another, even if it seems early on that it couldn't be further from the truth. I could feel their hearts ache and it made mine ache too. A sprinkle of humor here and there acts like a good spice - bringing out the flavor of the whole thing. All that makes the movie immensely watchable. It's tragic. It's heartbreaking. Yet, I didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>The acting is impeccable. Sam Rockwell may seem to be overdoing it in the beginning but then about half way through you realize that it is intentional."

","Frick. I loved this. Just awesome! I didn't just enjoy the performance, which was certainly stellar, I also loved its multi-layered themes. <br/><br/>The first thing that stood out to me as I began reminiscing over the film afterwards was how the film doesn't have a definitive ending, not something that plot-wise neatly wraps up the film, but only the lesser chaos that remains after the tempestuous few months since Mildred Hayes put up those three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri.<br/><br/>Perhaps, though, it was a neat conclusion, telling us that we indeed can leave the chaos of our lives be, and not try to necessarily fix them. Or that, perhaps, our emotions are truly what matter in the end-that what we do about our long-term emotions to make them healthy are what we should do, even if that doesn't necessarily go along with our short-term emotions of sorrow, guilt, regret, and hatred, which tire us out and don't achieve much in the end for a solution to a problem?<br/><br/>So should all this trouble that Mildred went through have happened in the first place? Was it necessary? Or at least helpful to her? What if Willoughby didn't kill himself? What exactly was Willoughby's motivation for killing himself? A mix of hopelessness at his cancer's development, pressure and responsibility for finding Angela Hayes, pain to see his wife suffer through his worsening conditions, revenge for Mildred's billboards? All could be possibilities, though I can at least tell that this suicide wasn't just as simple as his three letters have shown. That there was, or should have been, more implicit motivations behind this suicide-this turning point in Mildred's and Dixon's lives. <br/><br/>Which reminds me. I loved this film in another part due to Mildred's growth as a character. From a more or less calloused person to a traumatized mother grieving her daughter's death, to someone going all out to persevere towards her goal, to someone who begins to pay attention and understand others better, to, in the end, a much more tempered person, though, at this point, still reluctantly so. I just hope that she keeps this better sense of others in her for longer into the future."

When we talk about the script, something that awakens our attention, we expect the script to be adapted, but we are surprised to know that it is an original script, which makes the film even more interesting, since it opens many margins for the good director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh, telling the story of a mother indignant at the death of her daughter unresolved by the police, the film creates a context, and within it inserts its characters, some very caricature, but all very deep, or at least with some development, in addition, the long builds characters to then break, weaken and raise them again. The film talks about racism, violence, abuse of authority, homicide and domestic violence, of course, a pure feeling of impotence to be fought, the film is a machine gun for criticism, even though they are all exaggerated in absurd contexts. it is no longer a critical movie. Technically, the film is very good, with a greater emphasis on its great editing, composition of scenes, and great angles, open, with planes sequences, traveling, the camera of the film behaves perfectly, in addition to a photograph that warm, remembering a good old western. Frances McDormand is completely amazing, frightening and crazy, the character scares, and makes the viewer buy his idea, besides showing his sweet and ferocious moments, the other highlight goes to Sam Rockwell, who for me is the best character of the film, a character broken by nature, a class on how to build an antagonist, without vanity or modesty, Woody Harrelson too, is charming and captivating, even having little screen time. Finally, ""Three ads for a crime"" is not perfect, far from it, has problems, has scenes explained that do not need to be explained, has moments that is disconnected with the context that created, but still, it is a very good movie ."

","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is an interesting crime movie with a pinch of comedy. From the begining till the very end it is really interesting. The action may not always keep in tension but afterall it is well targeted.
I really enjoyed character Sam Rockwell played. He was not only funny but also brilliant (well, maybe not at the begining) . I think that Rockwell did very good job and he deserves an Academy Award.
A thing I really enjoyed was the mood movie was kept in. The whole scenery of a small town were everybody knows everybody was always good idea. It shows that there are many bad things that happen even in groups of trusted people
In conclusion, I think that the filmmakers were successful in their purpose, the movie is well made and I really enjoyed watching it. Highly recommed!"

","Mildred (Frances McDormand) has had a rough life. Her ex-husband was abusive but after the divorce, he still lives in the same town. More importantly, her beloved daughter was raped, burned, and murdered in cruel fashion. This was six months ago and there have been no arrests. The sheriff, Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his erratic deputy, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) have done their investigations and there are few new options. Nevertheless, Mildred believes her daughter's case is being filed and forgotten. Therefore, when she drives down a little-traveled road near her town of Ebbing, Missouri, she spies three billboards ready for new ads. Plunking down a cool $5000 of her own money, she asks the advertising company to put up questions relating to her child's murder, goading the sheriff's office. No, Willoughby is not happy. For a spell, television crews come and focus on Mildred's cause. But, no leads emerge. Meanwhile, Willoughby is seriously ill with cancer , making some of the townfolk turn against Mildred. All this while Milllie's ex-husband is parading around with a 19 year old girlfriend, her son has difficulty at high school, the town's dwarf (Peter Dinklage) wants to date Millie, and Deputy Dixon has a love-hate relationship with his mother. Will a killer be brought to justice? This powerhouse film is strong and serious but is not for all. For one, the language is profane quite often and there is violence, too. Some viewers will not be comfortable with these two matters. On the other hand, the cast is superb, with McDormand and Rockwell leading the way but with all cast members contributing mightily. The setting is rustic and unusual while script and direction are complete treasures. There are valuable lessons and entertaining hours to be taken from Three Billboards. Give it a try why don't you?"

Vivid depiction of characters, meticulously rendered storyline, implicit yet overwhelming emotion presented by the main characters, each of the above added together to form the solid structure of the movie. Yet, what captivated me the most was the conflicting human nature. <br/><br/>Mildred's aloofness and Dixon's toughness were their strongest shields which formed as they walk through thorns and thistles in life. But who we really are is a question we sometimes don't even know we are asking. <br/><br/>Right vs wrong, evil vs righteousness, two scenes with one Dixon threw Red out of window and another one where Dixon safeguarded the investigation file. Soft vs hard, warm vs cold, Mildred's response when Willoughby told her that he had a cancer and Mildred's reaction when seeing Willoughby cough blood. It was so clearly presented that they are, and we all are, much more complicated than we think. One could argue that their personalities have changed. I prefer the idea of ""to be, or not to be"". The deepest question for a human soul to answer lingers on after the movie was finished with the final question asked: ""Are you sure about this?

","A desperate grieving Mother (Francis McDormond) takes a drastic step in order to put pressure on the local Police Department investigating her Daughter's murder by renting three billboards and erecting messages that taunt the Chief of Police (Woody Harrelson) lack of progress.
What unfolds is a gripping black comedy Drama that mixes moments of humour with instant moments of such humanity and sadness it becomes a impossible not to be absorbed undeniable into it's story.
 
This is a film that portrays itself as a ""who done it"" but makes that a brave choice to become a rich character study of people just trying to people in amongst the wake of tragedy and circumstance.<br/><br/>Doesn't sound a laugh a minute but honestly most of the time it is, establishing dark laugh out statements of pure angry and grief.<br/><br/>
Whether McDormand is berating a Vicar, reporter of the chief of Police the foul mouthed rants are wonderfully written and delivered with fire.
That's another beautifully crafted aspect of the film are the tiny moments of the film's balance between rage and humanity. Whether amongst McDormond's hate filled mission she takes time out to put a upside down bug back on it's feet to screaming at the Chief Of Police than instantly finding common humanity amongst tradegy.
A story of good people all reacting to circumstances that life has handed them and acting accordingly the only way they know how from their grass roots.<br/><br/>It's truly a stand out out performance by Francis McDormand that has to earn her a Oscar Nomination she's frankly that good. Her face never stops working, when ever she's spoken to her face is still processing, expressing and captivating a woman in constant torment from the first shot to the end she's working 100%.
Woody Harrelson is on top form delivering a performance which like the film is comedic and sad with also one of the best character arks of the narrative along side Sam Rockwell as the racist child like deputy who does some growing up on the way.
This is storytelling unlike anything were normally used to from Hollywood. It's Bold, Engaging, Risk Taking Power House Drama that will surprise and leave you pondering long after it ends.
It won't be everyone's cup of tea but that is defiantly the point."

And I was disappointed.<br/><br/>My disappointment is nothing to do with the actors, all have given marvelous performances. But, the story is deeply faulty. There are so many potholes in the script that it just begs the question what were the writers thinking?<br/><br/>Secondly, the character of Mildred(McDormand) is deeply flawed and deeply angry throughout the movie. So much so that I began to hate her. Willoughby(Harrelson) is wasted and Dixon(Rockwell) is confusing. Now take it that this is not the actors fault, they have played their parts perfectly. The story doesn't do justice to any of the characters. The Billboards (that make the title of the movie) do not themselves inspire or lead to anything in the movie. That is the biggest flaw of the story and the biggest disappointment.<br/><br/>One of the reviewers here(on IMDB) has written out the exact flaws of the movie pointwise in his review, so I am not going to list them here again. Check them out.<br/><br/>I am just gonna say this movie is a terrible disappointment"
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","1","4","25 January 2018"," Great performances and characters, but flawed
","Its a good movie. Excellently acted and with a lot of good symbolism and a strong message. But it is sadly also a flawed film. I liked it and i would watch it again at any time as it was enjoyable, tense and had a lot of grew character development and dark humor. And here is the first problem. The story itself was incredibly serious and were the characters and while I do not mind dark humor in a heavy weighted film like this, here it was a bit too much, sometimes Martin McDonagh lost himself in that and it often felt like he did several scenes or made several decisions just for the sake of the humor.Another flaw the film had were some lose ends and some weird decisions. Now you have a great character like the one Woody Harrelson plays. You build him up extremely well just to kill him randomly off after less than half the film, just because you don't really know where to head with that character or because it doesnt serve any more purpose. Sure there are some critical moments of the film that are still influenced by that character after his death, but still, it felt weird. 
Other than that it was a great film that served as a showcase for some of the best performances of the year. First you have Frances McDormand who turns into one of this years most memorable and outstanding performances. She really becomes he role and you feel that hatred and broken heart she has. Great performance and one of the most perfect casting decisions in a long time. Woody Harrelson as mentioned was also good and had a great character. The Oscar nomination he received for it overrates the performance a little though. Sam Rockwell is definitely the stronger supporting role. What a character! And I love the way they developed him, which was unexpected and felt so real and good, because although it was hard to like him, you still kind of felt sorry for him. Wonderful performance. Abbie Cornish was the weakest link of the film. While Rockwell, McDormand and Harrelson were perfect casting coops, she was not. Totally miscast. Good to see John Hawkes and Peter Dinklage in significant supporting roles. Lucas Hedges was all right and I really liked Caleb Landry Jones who gave one of the best performances of his career. Great score, great atmosphere. A very good and watchable movie."
"brianhd71","8","1","4","24 January 2018"," Dark, Interesting, Sad and Funny
","What I liked best about this movie was the acting around outrageous plot twists, intense drama and occasional humor. The characters showed depth. Like this cop is 90% bad but he has some good in him, or this lady is going through some tough time, but she's still a bitch. The movie really centers around the tragic illness and demise of the Sheriff and his encouragement to his family, his friends and his opponents. It's really what brings the other main characters together in the end. 
What I did not like is the lack of resolution in the ending and all the tragedy that happens, but it's different. I'll give it that. There is a not happy ending in this movie, but there is somewhat of a coming to terms with the harsh reality of this lady's daughter being murdered. Do they take revenge on this other killer, or let it go? Who knows. Best movie I've seen this month, but considering The Shape of Whateverthehell and The FAKE News Post, it was an easy win."

The story is excellent, sad but funny, emotional and exciting. But the film has a problem. He has holes in the script, although he is very good.

","Martin McDonah's films have dealt with the comic overtones arising from violent clashes between men, a territory mined by Tarantino extensively, and like that writer-director's increasingly outlandish works, his stories have skated near the border of originality and self indulgence. In ""Three Billboards,"" he dives into the world of small-town racism and police corruption in the U.S. with the intent of telling a story of moral redemption, leaving the world of career criminals behind.<br/><br/>Critics that are currently throwing bricks at the film for failing to spell out the details of the racist behavior alluded to in the movie's early scenes, or focusing on white characters almost exclusively, miss the point of a character-driven story that isn't trying to be a movie of the week. Compared to some of the comic-book pictures of American life depicted by European directors such as Luc Besson, McDonah has taken a lighter touch. There is violence, but the story doesn't wallow in it. Frances McDormand even gets to reprise the moment of reconsideration that she had with Billy Crudup's character at the end of ""Almost Famous."""

","The guy who threatened Mildred and then bragged to his friend about a similar rape had the same modus operandi as the real killer. He definitely knew the real perpetrator which is why he went to scare her off her quest, meaning he had a stake in this. Since he was in Iraq at the time of the murder, it is apparent that a fellow soldier of his did it while off rotation, as a case of not being able to stop what they got used to doing there. The guy said that the rape and setting ablaze of the victim had been his obsession ever since, so probably it was the same for the real rapist.<br/><br/>In the end, Jason and Mildred did not turn around, albeit being hesitant to go all the way with their plan once there. The moment Mildred would have recognized the guy from the shop, they would have realized that he definitely had some connection and would have extracted a confession out of him as to who the real killer was - most probably someone in his unit who was currently on his tour.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that they would have solved the case, given the circumstances as no way they were dropping all the facts as a mere coincidence. Had he not revealed who the other guy was, they would have killed him instead, since he was basically the same type."
"cschultz-2","8","1","4","14 December 2017"," Difficult and Challenging
","The critics are practically falling all over themselves in their efforts to find new ways to praise ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri."" But it's not the kind of praise somebody uses when they enjoy a picture, or are entertained by it.<br/><br/>
Rather, the critics seem be heaping upon this movie the kind of praise you'd give to a complete stranger if he made an unflattering but surprisingly accurate observation about you in the presence of your friends-either you compliment him on his comprehension, or risk looking like a fool.<br/><br/>
In ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri,"" when after seven months no arrest is made for the rape and murder of her teenaged daughter, a grieving mother rents three deserted billboards on the outskirts of town and displays on them messages designed to provoke the local police chief into placing a priority on her daughter's case, and renewing his efforts to locate and arrest her killer.<br/><br/>
Written, produced, and directed by the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh-the writer and director of the critically-acclaimed ""In Bruges"" in 2008 and ""Seven Psychopaths"" in 2012-""Three Billboards"" is being described as a black comedy. But more accurately, the picture is a tragedy which occasionally incites a sort of ironic humor. What laughter comes from the picture is rueful, self-conscious, and sometimes even nervous-chuckles with a question mark at the end.<br/><br/>
The billboards are at first tolerated by the grieving mother's sympathetic neighbors, then openly criticized. Finally, the community begins to ostracize the woman. And after her billboards fail to achieve the desired result, she escalates her campaign to provoke the police into action, with methods which include assault, vigilantism, and eventually even domestic terrorism. <br/><br/>
At the center of ""Three Billboards"" is a riveting, virtuoso performance by Frances McDormand as Mildred Hayes, the grieving mother. In intimately-adjusted levels, McDormand's Mildred slowly loses her sense of rationality, and her ability to interact with society. Her difficulties and emotional agony are reflected in her eyes-as she grows more and more estranged from her neighbors, the light of reason begins to fade from her eyes, and the viewer senses she's losing her sanity, and even her soul.<br/><br/>
Along the way, the audience's reaction is tested also. Like the townspeople of Ebbing, the viewer is at first sympathetic to the mother and patronizing of her eccentricities. But as we grow more uncomfortable with her actions-and before long are even horrified by them-we conversely become more sympathetic to the police chief, played with a sense of canny, homespun wisdom by the wonderfully-talented Woody Harrelson.<br/><br/>
In case you haven't noticed, Woody Harrelson has matured and developed into one of our most solid, dependable, and inventive character actors. Harrelson's presence in a picture all but guarantees its quality. Those viewers who doubt the actor's ability to stray from his television persona are advised to look at Harrelson's genuinely terrifying characterization in 2013's ""Out of the Furnace,"" filmed in and around Pittsburgh. And in ""Three Billboards,"" Harrelson contributes a customarily thoughtful and multidimensional performance.<br/><br/>
Martin McDonagh's script and direction of ""Three Billboards"" makes it heartbreakingly plain for the viewer to observe how easy it is for a person to surrender to bitterness and despair. A flashback scene halfway through showing Mildred and her family interacting with love and warmth prior to the daughter's murder becomes almost unbearable in its contrast to the bitter cynicism of the rest of the picture. <br/><br/>
It's during the flashback that we realize that part of Mildred's mania-her growing outrageousness, and her motivation to maintain the billboards-is a hysterical need to shift the responsibility and blame for her daughter's death away from herself. And it's the growing affection we feel for the grieving mother, the police, and the townspeople of Ebbing which contributes more than any other factor to the ultimately unsettling nature of the picture's conclusion.<br/><br/>
Already nominated for six Critics' Choice Awards, ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri"" is a great film-challenging, and often difficult to watch. In seeing the residents of Ebbing Missouri, we're seeing ourselves through the eyes of outsiders-our strengths and weaknesses, our foibles and eccentricities, our reflexive and conditioned sense of justice. The success of the picture depends almost entirely upon the audience's ability and willingness to recognize and acknowledge in ourselves the unflattering realities as well as the greatness. <br/><br/>
It's not easy to hold a mirror to ourselves and ask, ""Is this how the world sees us?"" Especially when the answer is, ""Yes, it probably is."""

","The performances in this film are all spectacular. Frances McDormand shines as Mildred. She's brash, rude, abrasive; but deep down you realize she has a softer side. The character's nuance is what makes her so engaging. McDormand captures all of the different dimensions and aspects of her character perfectly, and it makes for a truly compelling lead. Woody Harrelson is also great as Chief Willoughby. He comes across as one way at first, but then you realize he is a completely different person than you had originally believed him to be. This is part of a larger idea with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, one that I'll go into more detail on later. But the true star of this movie, for me, is Sam Rockwell. He gives one of the best performances I've seen from him in a while. I don't think it will happen, but right now I believe Rockwell to be deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nomination. His character is the backbone of the story, and is really what makes it as profound of a film as it is.

He burst onto the scene (at least, to me) with the 2008 character study IN BRUGES.  I next ran across him with the 2012 ""B"" movie action flick SEVEN PSYCOPATHS and now, in 2017 he brings us THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MISSOURI.<br/><br/>In each of this films, McDonagh brings us interesting character studies set against a backdrop of violence.  While the violence that punctuates this films - and these worlds - it is the characters in the films reaction to the violence that intrigues me.<br/><br/>Such is the case with THREE BILLBOARDS...Frances McDormand plays Mildred a mother who is still angry over the rape and murder of her daughter 9 months ago and take her anger out to the local Police who, she thinks, have stopped trying to solve the case.  <br/><br/>McDormand commands the screen in the lead role of Mildred.  She has a strength of character - and a backbone - that jumps off the screen.  Her anger continues to seethe just under the surface and explodes outward from time to time.  But, this is no one note character.  There also is a charm, understanding and motherly love and warmth that comes out - especially when she deals with her son (played by Lucas Hedges of MANCHESTER BY THE SEA) and when she deals with the Sheriff played by Woody Harrelson.<br/><br/>Counterbalancing McDormand's performance is Sam Rockwell as the dimwitted, bigoted Deputy Sheriff.  He is all testosterone and drunkenness and explodes on the scene just as strongly as McDormand's character.  But, again, this is not a one-note character.  Throughout the course of the film, you get to know Deputy Dixon and begin to understand him - somewhat.<br/><br/>Both McDormand and Rockwell are being touted as potential Acadamy Award nominees and I would be fine with that - especially in the performance of Rockwell, an under-appreciated actor, IMHO.  But, I would also like to point out the performance of Woody Harrelson as Sheriff Willoughby - another fine, nuanced performance that shows, once again, what a terrific performer he is.<br/><br/>These performances are joined by other strong supporting performances, most notably by Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish and Sandy Martin as ""Mama Dixon"", Deputy Dixon's just as dimwitted and bigoted mother.  Suffice it to say, the apple didn't fall very far from the tree.  Only Peter Dinklage is wasted in what amounts to an extended cameo.  It had the potential to be a good role, there just wasn't enough there to satisfy - especially when employing an actor of Dinklage's ability.<br/><br/>Why am I spending so much time talking about the acting?  Because the story is problematic and the ending is less than satisfying.  I enjoyed the characters in this world, and I understood the world that was built by Director McDondagh but I just didn't particularly like the story that was told.<br/><br/>So...A for acting and C+ for story which makes this film have a letter grade of B+.<br/><br/>7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","I watched this movie by mistake. It is not the type of movie I like, but I watched it to kill time. <br/><br/>I don't like the story and many key characters in the movie look like the psychopath. However, this movie tells more about real people than the other two. <br/><br/>Yes, believing people are good, we need to love each other, every story deserves a happy ending is the type of movie we want all of the family members to come to watch it. However, in the real world, there is a more sad story about the ugly, irrational, the bad qualities of people. In our daily lives, there is more hatred, more violence, more crimes, more victims than we think. <br/><br/>The reality may be too dark to face, sometimes, as the billboard complained, ""**How come**?"" The woman in the movie is angry, hatred, violence, irrational psychopath. The policemen in the movie said F* words, being rude, hurt the innocent, emotional and too easily be triggered. There are many plots in the movie that I feel hard to explain, but feeling very realistic. <br/><br/>The director pictured a victim and people in the town paid for her pain, whose daughter being raped while dying as she happened to cursed. To my eye, the story lines start from hatred, triggers crime, and then, the victim become the murderer - it is an evil to evil circle around. <br/><br/>Putting up three billboards, at the very first beginning, is a complaint, but soon it turns out to be an evil action which triggers other unexpected consequences. At the end of the story, two good people are going after an innocent person, who they want to pull out their anger towards him, so they made up a suspicious crime. <br/><br/>The three red billboards lead to a never-ending evil circle. <br/><br/>Well, from this movie, I don't know why there are so many people like it and rank very high 8.5/10 It may be the actors who made this movie very realistic. This movie is not my cup of tea, but I enjoy how it captures human being's emotions."

","The story is taking revenge by mother for her daughters killing. Her styles of sticking three billboards of accused is looks unique, but actual revenge drama missed thrill at all. For final climax you have to wait more time. Moreover end is not right for such revenge story. What is in such end ? I don't understand. I also wonder about high ratings whereas there are many good revenge movies to name like ' Peppermint' of Jenifer Garner etc. If you wish to best revenge then must see Peppermint and avoid Three billboards instead for boring drama. 4 stars is enough."

","I never saw a drama that got so many laughs out of me. It was surreal to sit in an audience that was laughing once or twice a minute-- almost in spite of themselves (given the dark subject matter.) And yet it wasn't a comedy. It was just a beautiful character study and an intriguing story, refusing to be bound by genre. And behind all the laughter, it was deeply affecting. Not that the Oscars matter, but if they did, I'd argue that this one should have won."

","I have always expected fine performances from Frances McDormand, and she doesn't disappoint in Martin McDonagh's ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". As a bereaved mother demanding that the police in a small town find out who raped and murdered her daughter, McDormand gives it her all. And boy is it a heavy-duty role! Almost every scene in the movie made me feel as if I was in the scene with the characters (and as if I was walking on eggshells).<br/><br/>Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell won well deserved Oscars for their roles (and while accepting her Oscar, McDormand called for inclusion riders to ensure a higher number of women involved in the production of movies). But even ignoring that, this is one impressive movie. The acting, direction, cinematography, and complexity of the characters. The end says that, even though Mildred didn't find her daughter's killer, she had to go after another killer to put herself at rest.<br/><br/>An outstanding movie. Also starring Woody Harrelson, John Hawkes, Zeljko Ivanek and Peter Dinklage."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","1","5","11 April 2018"," The most important film of 2017, and probably the most relevant to #MeToo.
","Three Billboards is an angry film that is a very front-on criticism about police inaction and how our general push to have justice for those of us long-gone, and how relevant public awareness truly is, especially that of unresolved murder cases pressuring the law to act as best as it possibly can. And at the forefront of this cinematic milestone is Frances McDormand and her Oscar-winning performance as Mildred Hayes, an embattled mother who still wants justice for her dead daughter.<br/><br/>As a black-comedy, this film works with its outright shocking and laugh-out-loud humor that would have been impossible in another movie, yet even with all the black humor at play here, there's also an equally strong sense of tragedy and pessimism about the whole thing. Three Billboards is the rare kind of movie where the drama is EQUALLY as potent as the flashes of black humor that you see playing throughout the story. There's humor relating to dwarfism, racism, and even suicide; and it's all totally relevant to the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>This film is a downer but it's one that does have glimpses of optimism throughout its depressing story, and it's actually too important for this day and age to be ignored. This is truly a film that needs to be watched by everyone wanting to start a fight for real justice in the real world.<br/><br/>Confronting, funny, absolutely sincere and too important to pass up; 5/5 stars."

"austin0731","8","1","5","24 February 2018"," Wonderful and subtle exploration of human emotions
","Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is a wonderful and subtle exploration of the human experience, rage and how we deal with pain. The cast gave amazing performances that goes to present this theme of blind rage and letting go. The film takes place in the small town setting featuring a small group of cast that were all very impactful and were each well defined and have very human and authentic emotions. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the cinematography and these use of the colours of orange and blue to create this contrast of emotions. Each character was a given a significant arc that involved the themes of redemption and growing. With the film ending on a note where characters who have now changed and evolved throughout the film are faced with a decision and essentially leaves the audience to make up their own mind on what happens next. It was a brilliant way to end the film. <br/><br/>In particular, Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell were the highlights of the film, with honourable mention: Woody Harrelson. The way in which McDormand balances a hard outer shell and the soft, vulnerable side of her character was great to behold, an enjoyable performance featuring her tough gritty attitude and her grief of loss. While Sam Rockwell brilliantly balanced two personalities too, he played a character that was highly irritable, hated and immature, yet in other scenes he is depicted in a righteous, brave and selfless sense. Wonderfully portrayed to make the audience believe in the changes in the character. <br/><br/>This is a film with a lot of heart, and depict the small town feel brilliantly. The use of comedy adds so much to the film in aiding its authenticity and connection to the audience, a wonderful, 'slow-burn' feel with complex and intense drama."

","Hmm. Not sure what to say about this one. I also had to pick a rather random rating, as it's an easy 10/10 in some respects, a 5/10 in others and a 2/10 in yet others.<br/><br/>Let's start with the great. This movie is absolutely beautifully acted, photographed and directed.<br/><br/>McDormand's performance is breathtaking - especially the non-verbal side: what she can communicate with an expression is incredible. And the photography is some of the best I've seen for a very long time.<br/><br/>It captures a small-town world in a very compelling and persuasive way. There are some touching moments and some funny ones.<br/><br/>But for me, it didn't quite gel. It wasn't exactly a tragicomedy. It wasn't a moving film with some moments where you weren't sure whether to laugh or cry. It was more like a tragedy where, from time to time, they decided the mood was too sombre and threw in some visual or verbal jokes.<br/><br/>There were also some parts that stretched my suspension of disbelief. Without giving anything away, one person behaving in an unlikely way, ok; two people doing the same thing, well ...<br/><br/>The ending was, however, perfect."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","5","28 January 2018"," Touching, funny, intriguing - all you could hope for
","""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" is the fourth directorial effort by British Oscar-winning filmmaker Martin McDonagh and as I must say I am quite a fan of his previous 3 directorial efforts, I cannot deny that my hopes for this one here were pretty high too. Of course, they also were because of the massive deal of awards recognition this has received in the last couple months. It is one of the films that has a shot at taking home Best Picture at the Oscars this year. It runs for slightly under 2 hours and takes us on a journey into the life of Mildred Hayes, who fights the local police department hoping this is gonna speed things up in the difficult task of finding her daughter's killer. The police gets represented by the performances of Rockwell and Harrelson here and Rockwell (like McDormand) seems in a safe spot for an Oscar win too now. There are other known actors in here like Cornish, Ivanek, Dinklage, Hedges, Hawkes etc. But it really is McDormand's film for the most part and I can see why they did not put Rockwell in lead. Still, a shout-out to my man Woody Harrelson who is having another fantastic year with this one and his turn in The Glass Castle. We talked about that one on another occasion already. As for this one here though, his voice-over sequences were among the very best it had to offer. And also the most touching. Hearing his letters that he wrote before his suicide is really heartbreaking stuff, especially the one to his wife, but also the one to Dixon. As for the one to his wife, the comment about how seeing her pain is worse than the privileges of spending a few more days with his daughters is good will easily wet your eyes. The one to Dixon goes well in hand with another really well-written scene as the moment Dixon changes for the better and saves the file from the flames had really so much to offer. In general, I think McDonagh did an amazing job with the writing, especially the dialogue writing. It was spot-on and often also very funny, but dark humor is something you expect here as it is omnipresent in all his previous works too. The ****head that is also in the trailer is among the very best comedic moments of the entire year.<br/><br/>Another thing I want to mention about this film is the subject of forgiveness. Of course, Mildred won't forgive the killer of her daughter, but it is a subject that keeps coming back, especially in the second half, be it either the orange juice scene, the scene with Dixon forgiving Mildred for the fire, or both sort of forgiving the other potential killer at the very end inside the car. The film ends the perfect moment, even if it was a bit expected. This is the first moment when we see the central character showing something like forgiveness at all, even before she was not ready to remove the Willoughby billboard despite his death. It's a key to having a happier life again as grief is of course still there, but it is not everything. Dinklage's character (McDonagh sure has it with midget humor) described in one scene nicely how McDormand's character is always sad and negative and this may change in all that happens after the film now that she let forgiveness in her heart to some extent at least. As for Dinklage's character, I liked that they were not really shoving a out-of-nowhere love story in our faces then, but that it ends after the date because of obstacles both characters yet have to overcome. McDonagh also does a great job with realism because honestly having the killer sit coincidentally at the very same pub all of a sudden the very same time that Rockwell's character does would have been a shot of one in a million and nothing remotely authentic. So it's good it was somebody else. There was really not a lot I didn't like in here. The first sentence about torturing blacks that is also featured in the trailer had a bit of Hollywood liberalism written all over it while the n-word and torture fun scene afterwards was pretty hilarious without a doubt. In terms of gay-themed references, the same is true too. Struggling a bit with the inclusion, but solid elaboration. The only scene I really did not like was the flashback sequence when we see the daughter when she was still alive and honestly how they talk about her murder feels really out of place and too big of a coincidence. Then again, it is not elaborated on properly as this could have been fictitious in Mildred's mind as well or it could have been another talk, not the one that directly came before she went off and got killed. So as a whole, I very much enjoyed this film, the cast is outstanding, the script is really really good and the other components like the music, especially the songs used, are top-notch too. I'd be happy if this really wins Best Picture at the Oscars as it would be deserving, one of the best films of the year, not my personal number one, but I highly recommend checking it out and it's a shame McDonagh did not get the Best Director nomination. You really don't wanna miss this one. Watch it now!"

","There are still some great ideas left in Hollywood, followed by some great actors and great directors. And sometimes, all of those people get combined together in something called a great drama about a mourning mother of a murdered daughter that decides to rock the small community in Ebbing, Missouri to its foundations in an attempt to restart the police investigation that is tapping in one place for months by criticizing the local law enforcement by leasing three billboards just outside the city limits.
On that road, magnificent Frances McDormand will receive some fierce (best Sam Rockwell in years) and some moderate opposition (always reliable Woody Harrelson), while one of the most gifted directors of the younger generation (McDonagh) discreetly follows the unravelling of this peculiar social experiment. Trademark humor that we saw in ''In Bruges'' will be there as well, and everything will go smoothly till the beginning of the bottom third of the movie. 
There, the script will dissipate, as well as the motivation and actions of the main characters, leading to the disappointing ending of this great movie story.
''Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri'' is, beyond any doubt, the best US movie this year, although plagued by some serious flaws and it will represent no surprise if it sweeps the ''Oscars''."

","New year, new race to get as many awards as possible. Having the Golden Globes gone by, now it's time to race for the big prize: the Oscars and this movie is going to be in that race and probably take some awards too, which it has already started to do.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a simple concept: a girl was murdered and her mother is tired of waiting for the police to do something, so she comes up with the brilliant idea to use three huge billboards as pressure for the police department to keep moving on with the investigation. Being it a script from director Martin McDonagh, which has us used to interesting ones, the movies doesn't disappoint at all. On the contrary, at the beginning one thinks that the plot is going to one way but is it going to another one and at a different path, and before you know the story comes to an end and you want to watch more of it, see of what happens. Because if we know something, is that no Martin McDonagh movie is predictable.<br/><br/>Moving to the amazing cast: Frances McDormand is the movie. She is just so awesome in her role that you completely forget about anything else. Nothing else matters, only her. She does a brilliant performance that will end for sure with many awards on her shelf (she has started to collect them). She portrays this mother who has lost a child in a not so typical way. We are used to witness angry, desperate, moody mothers but in here the sole point is anger. Anger that she expresses in all possible ways and even though it's not something to laugh about, you might find some hilariously situations because of how unbelievable are. Unbelievable in the good sense. And her performance shine anything thanks to a good cast of supporting actors, making a special mention to Sam Rockwell who is the one that keeps the action going on, who spurs the fire.<br/><br/>This is a remarkable movie that shouldn't be forgotten to watch nor should we make the mistake of thinking that because it is creating a hype, it is going to be a bad one. It has a wonderful cast and a great plot, that might sound familiar to many other movies but it is not. It will give you a surprise once you have watched it and you will understand why is it going to shake this year's award season."

This $12 instrument is not something that one just picks up along the way, as, say a universal Bic Round Stic or a regional TD Bank finds its way into your desk drawer. Willoughby might be a man who would stop in an aisle in Target and consider a writing instrument, admiring the dependable and reassuring clip, understanding the utility and aesthetic when inserted in his uniform breast pocket. But Dickson? No. In the unlikely scenario that he found himself in need of a pen and could not swipe one from the Gas n' Go or a coworkers pencil cup, 69 cents would be his price point.

","I was surprised by the amount of bad language featured in just the trailer for this movie, from this I was already wanting to see it, then more so when it was getting nominations during Awards Season, I was hoping for an interesting tragicomedy, from writer and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, The Guard). Basically teenager Angela Barnes (Kathryn Newton) was raped and murdered seven months ago, her mother Mildred (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Frances McDormand) is grieving, but also angry at the lack of progress in the investigation. Driving towards her town, outside of Ebbing, Missouri, she passes three unused billboards, she makes enquiries to Red Welby (Caleb Landry Jones) at the company that rents them. She pays for them to read, in sequence, ""RAPED WHILE DYING"", ""AND STILL NO ARRESTS?"", and ""HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?"" The billboards upset the townspeople, including Sheriff Bill Willoughby (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Woody Harrelson), who the third billboard refers to, and officer Jason Dixon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Sam Rockwell). The fact that Willoughby suffers from terminal pancreatic cancer adds to their disapproval, Mildred and her depressed son Robbie (Lucas Hedges) are harassed and threatened, but she stays firm, to Robbie's disappointment. While Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration, he thinks the billboards are an unfair attack on his character. Dixon is angry at Mildred's lack of respect, he threatens Red, and arrests her friend Denise (Amanda Warren) for insignificant possession of marijuana. Mildred also receives a visit from her abusive ex-husband Charlie (John Hawkes), who blames her for the death of their daughter. Willoughby brings Mildred in for questioning after she has an altercation with her dentist, she injured him with a drill at the clinic. During the interview, Willoughby coughs up blood, against medical advice, he leaves the hospital to spend time an idyllic day with his wife Anne (Abbie Cornish) and daughters, before committing suicide with a gunshot to the head. Before he killed himself, Willoughby wrote several suicide notes for people, including one to Mildred, in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide. Willoughby has also secretly paid to keep her billboards up for another month, amused at the trouble it will bring her, a stranger (Brendan Sexton III) soon threatens her in the store she works. Dixon reacts to the news of Willoughby's death by assaulting Red and his assistant, the new chief and Willoughby's replacement Abercrombie (Clarke Peters) witnesses the attack and fires Dixon. Mildred is devastated when passing the billboards to find them on fire, an arson attack, meanwhile Dixon hears that there is a suicide note for him back at the police station. Still in possession of the keys, Dixon enters the police station at night to read the note, which advises him to let go of hate and learn to love so he can achieve his dream of becoming a detective. Dixon is unaware that Mildred is retaliating to destruction of the billboards by tossing bottle bombs at the station, she assumed the building was unoccupied, Dixon escapes the burning building, throwing out Angela's case files, but suffers severe burns. Mildred's acquaintance James (Peter Dinklage) witnessed the incident, but provides Mildred with an alibi to the police, claiming that they were on a date. Dixon is discharged from hospital and goes to a bar, whilst there he overhears the man who threatened Mildred in the store bragging about an incident similar to Angela's murder. Dixon notes the man's car licence plate, he scratches the man's face, provoking a fight, but removes the man's skin from his nails, as a DNA sample to investigate if he had any part in Angela's murder. Meanwhile, Mildred accepts the offer from James to go on a real date, as a thank you for the alibi, but this is spoiled when Charlie enters, with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope (Samara Weaving), he admits to burning the billboards, Mildred instructs Charlie to treat Penelope well and leaves. Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match DNA found on Angela's body, and that the man was on military duty aboard at the time of the murder. Mildred and Dixon conclude that the man must be guilty of some other rape, so they plan to drive to Idaho, carrying a gun, on the way, Mildred confesses to starting the police station fire, Dixon replies without surprise, they both have reservations about their mission, but agree to decide what to do on the way. Also starring Kerry Condon as Pamela, Sandy Martin as Momma Dixon and Christopher Berry as Tony. McDormand gives a brilliant performance as the divorced mother, who tests our sympathies, bankrolling an ad campaign to find her daughter's killer, Rockwell is also fantastic as the dim-witted cop with issues, and Harrelson does well in his time onscreen as the happy-go-lucky sheriff trying to justify himself, whilst also suffering a deadly disease. This is a clever mix of both the funny and the tragic, the high amount of foul language and one-liners are what get the right amount of chuckles, but it is also poignant in its approach to grief, emotional reactions, and other hard-hitting material, it is both sad and funny, a marvellous black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Score for Carter Burwell, Best Original Screenplay for Martin McDonagh and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Very good!"

Sam is such an amazing actor that and deserves an Oscar for his performance in this role, I absolutely love that man. There is another amazing performance that is worth noting, actor Caleb Landry Jones is incredible in the role of ""Red"" Caleb is new to me, but I remember him from Get Out and he's just perfect in Three Billboards.

I read one review and they broke down every situation that was wrong with the film, like the movie would be over If blah, blah, blah got arrested, the Billboards should of burned, like it's the story!

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","Null","1","5","29 December 2017"," Martin Mcdonogh pulls a hat trick
","Irish writing/directing guru Martin McDonough has pulled a miraculous hat-trick with Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, a pitch perfect follow up to his other two black dramedies, In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. He's an unbelievable talent who specializes in caustic, vigorously sharp dialogue and comic moments organically drawn from real life situations, not to mention a heap of earned emotional moments and narratives that, try as the viewer might, are impossible to predict. This is a near perfect bookend to the trilogy, with a late career encore turn from Frances Mcdormand, who cements an oddly Coen-esque vibe that's welcome. She plays Mildred Hays here, a fiery single mother whose frustration and rage at the rape and murder of her teen daughter is fuelled into the purchase of three advertising billboards on the outskirts of town, calling out the Sheriff (Woody Harrelson) and his department for their lack of arrests or convictions. Needless to say, this brazen act causes a hailstorm Of events both funny and sad, strange and mundane, but never boring. Harrelson is a blast of potent poignancy as Chief Willoughby, a stern family man who laconically protests the Billboards, but understands the poor woman's intentions. His arc is one that leaves you puzzled and tugs at the heartstrings unexpectedly, especially when it comes to his relationship with his beautiful wife (Abbie Cornish, most excellent). Sam Rockwell is the height of hilarity as Dixon, a certifiably nuts, volatile man-child of a deputy who violently takes matters into his own hands and exacerbates the whole deal wonderfully with his antics. Rockwell was a dynamo enough in Seven Psychos, and here he takes that loony persona into the stratosphere, a whirling dervish of bizarre, idiosyncratic wonderment. Other standouts include Peter Dinklage as a love-struck dwarf that everyone refers to as a midget, John Hawkes as Mildred's troubled ex husband, Lucas Hedges as her traumatized son and Caleb Landry Jones as an oddball local advertising mogul. McDonough's calling card is his defiant refusal to tell a story in Hollywood's glossy, surface level terms, deliberately punctuating his tales with vagueness, eccentricity and constant reminders that people, emotions, characters and narratives are complex, weird concepts which are seldom black and white or clear cut in any direction. The arcs here are broad, surprising and beautifully drawn, with the same deep set sadness he brought us In Bruges, accented by the acidic, dysfunctional and cheerfully profane writing that showed up in Seven Psychos. This is a film that ducks the pesky limbo bar of standards set by the Hollywood machine in favour of something more unique, a road less travelled when it comes to comedy dramas, but one that anyone seeking fresh, alive and different material would be much rewarded trekking down. One of the best films of the year."
"billcr12","8","1","5","28 December 2017"," Dark Comedy
","Martin McDonagh hits another home run with Three Billboards. In Bruges was one of my ten best in 2008. He also produced The Guard, one my best of 2011. He has made the transition from writing plays in Ireland, to somehow having the ear to write dialogue for American actors. Frances McDormand is the star here, and she should be preparing her acceptance speech for the upcoming Academy Awards. She is Mildred Hayes, a divorced mother whose teen daughter has been raped and murdered on the side of a desolate road. The slow moving, Mayberry like police department is not exactly Scotland Yard. Mildred has the inspiration to rent three billboards with the messages of raped while dying, still no arrests, and how come Chief Willoughby? The chief is played by Woody Harrelson, and he matches McDormand scene for scene. The film is violent, funny and has a deep, dark cynicism throughout. McDonagh shares a verbal style similar to Quentin Tarantino, my other current favorite filmmaker. It is amazing what can be done with a relatively small ($12 million) budget. It was money well spent."

This was terrifying to watch...like, genuinely disturbing. But, then, no more than five to ten minutes later I was laughing my ass off at a witty remark or an awkward inconvenience. This movie has a power, a power few other works of art possess. It is this generation's ""Fargo"", which is not to say it isn't original or unique, because it is. The characters are extremely compelling and not exactly like any heroes or villains from any other film I have seen. As a matter of fact, this movie has no heroes or villains. It has people, and these people hold REAL emotions and act upon these emotions in an often brutal and shocking manner. Even characters who share one minute of screen time are well developed and enjoyable to just simply observe. 
 In the end, the film refuses to give us solid, conclusive answers or details. We are left sitting in our theater seats, forced to contemplate who the bad and good guys in our world really are. Is it a tragedy? Is it a comedy? You decide. I say it's both and it's neither. If anything, it is a pitch black tragicomedy that still contains elements of surprising humanity despite also being plagued by clouds of cynicism, violence, and just overall disgusting and disturbing behavior."

","Mildred Hayes' daughter was murdered in the small town of Ebbing and, seven months later, her killer is no closer to being found. So Mildred rents 3 large drive-by billboards on which she posts provocative messages directed at police chief Willoughby. And they do, indeed, stir things up.<br/><br/>Martin McDonagh writes and directs. His first feature, In Bruges, was a dark and savage black comedy. His next was the forgettable Seven Psychopaths, but he is back on form again with Three Billboards. Everything you expect from the trailer is here, but there is a great deal more. In particular, there is one crucial plot development which, thankfully, isn't even hinted at in the trailer.<br/><br/>The story is original, and the dialogue (which includes some very strong language) is fabulous. For such a dark story, a lot of it is laugh-out-loud funny. It is also very human: there is one flashback scene which finishes with something so brutally heartbreaking I nearly cried out loud with pain in the cinema.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Frances McDormand but, by heavens, she is good in this. Best actress Oscar good (as we now know). Woody Harrelson isn't far behind, and Sam Rockwell is solid, too, suffering only from a character whose development arc doesn't completely convince. And the conclusion is bold and, again, nowhere near expectations.<br/><br/>This is a remarkable and original movie, and highly recommended if you don't mind something on the strong side."

"jbaird-69485","5","1","6","1 February 2018"," overrated
","Minimal spoiler alert. I rate this movie a 5 out of 10. The people who rave about it are uncritical about the fact that the storyline is unconvincing and contrived. Those who pan it don't mention that this movie keeps your attention throughout, even when you can't suspend disbelief. The acting is strong; all the leads are commendable. The script is weak; our heroine is a vigilante thug who is never held accountable for her actions. Not realistic. There are too many subplots in this movie and they are unresolved. Too much going on, it is an unfocused mess. When, at the end, when we are led to believe some growth has taken place,.....we are disappointed again. Maybe I will start liking this movie more with time, but my gut reaction is, its overrated."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","1","6","28 December 2017"," Great story and casting
","Usually, if the writer is also the director, the film would be with less problems. This film is another proof of such premises. McDormand is a veteran good actor, when she was young, she was almost a looker, but now, an old ugly woman, but her performance is more pure and natural. When I watched her in this film, I couldn't help thinking Jackie Chan in his recent ""The Foreigner"", he's old and ugly too like Mcdormand, but his acting was more mature and deep. Both of these two actors in these two films could touch your heart and move you deeply. All the main characters in this film uniformly changed their accent of there local dialect in a Southern tone, giving you a more realistic localized feeling. Anytime when actor could change his or her tone and accent according to the scripted locality, is definitely a more talented actor, Mcdormand, Harrelson and Rockwell all proved their flexibility of adaption to when they should change their way of speaking, unlike Samuel Jackson or Matthew McConaughey, they cannot change their way of speaking and their accent, every film with different roles but their speaking tone and accent are always the same. <br/><br/>This is a very good film, but the ending seems to give me an impression like a first episode of a TV drama series, or even a pilot, because the answer may still be in Idaho and they are not sure if the culprit rapist murderer is the guy who drive a pickup with an Idaho license plate. This is still a big question mark instead of a spoiled fact; the possibility might worth evolving into a TV series, and would be quite interesting too.<br/><br/>Ebbing, Missouri also seems to be a fictitious city."
"srjcochrane","9","1","6","27 December 2017"," Awesome cast balance
","Rarely do you get a film where the entire cast balance each other to improve the overall appreciation. This was one of those rare films. The topic is raw and the language even mor raw but is is worth the effort to sit through the entire 2 hours. On par with Big Sick for watchability and relateable storyline."
"istumbo","9","1","6","21 December 2017"," One of the best of 2017!
","Martin McDonagh's Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the very best films of the year and a wonderful showcase of actors, writing and direction. 
Frances McDormand stars as Mildred, a woman who knows that the investigation into her daughter's rape and subsequent murder has stalled. Tired of the police dragging their feet, she rents three billboards outside of her home town , each of them asking Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), why her daughter's murder has not been solved.
This leads to people in the town taking sides, events start to unravel and things take very interesting turns that the audience will probably not see coming as Mildred has to take matters into her own hands to find justice for her daughter.
McDormand has been acting for a long time, winning an Oscar in 1996 for her brilliant work in Fargo. Moviegoers may take advantage of the fact that she is so great but she has rarely been in this fine form. As Mildred, she tackles a role of a no-nonsense woman (which she plays so well) but brings such humanity to her that we are with her every step of the way, even if her decisions are extreme at best.
Sam Rockwell does his best work as officer Dixon, an intense, racist cop who has quite a temper and works on impulse too much of the time. Rockwell's character takes a turn at one point and Rockwell plays unhinged so well that he is as consistent as he has ever been.
The supporting cast is rounded out well by Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes and Peter Dinklage. McDonagh puts out one of the best scripts of the year laced with laugh out loud dark humor and quiet, dramatic moments that balance so effortlessly. It's hard to predict what comes next and that is what drives this film.
Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of the must see films of the year and I can predict will probably make my top five films. The performances are outstanding, especially McDormand and Rockwell, the script and direction are top notch and this is a great murder mystery comedy/drama. It is such a unique film and one that feels completely real. 4 stars/ 4 stars.<br/><br/>YouTube: Entertainment Examiner"
"andrewbunney","9","1","6","19 December 2017"," Many will label it a classic.
","Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his loose-cannon off-sider, Dixon (Sam Rockwell), are formidable targets but Frances McDormand as Mildred channels John Wayne to righteously cut through the crap of lazy, redneck cops and small, small-town minds.<br/><br/>A mother on a mission, she is one of several larger than life characters on a significant journey in this resonant tale. It's a thriller full of surprises, action and humanity, set to a cool soundtrack including Townes Van Sandt and Abba; a wild ride into raw emotional territory where a hilarious scene will turn to brutality or tragedy 'on a dime'.<br/><br/>Three Billboards is immensely entertaining and will long be remembered. It's a rare, original film with wonderful characters, images and a powerful script. Many will label it a classic."
"benkitching13","9","1","6","12 December 2017"," Bordering on masterpeice status.
","Billboards is, for the most part, an emotionally devastating masterclass hosting some of the richest performances I can ever recall seeing. <br/><br/>Despite the entirety of Billboards being fairy consistent, there are marginal differences in the quality of the film between it's first and second halves.
Whilst the first half of the film is a commendable effort, it serves more as a prelude to the intoxicatingly good second half, as opposed to being a standalone piece of material. The second half of the film is a richly immersive, mesmerizing gem. <br/><br/>As briefly mentioned, the performances are outstandingly compelling. Sam Rockwell was considerably impressive in Seven Psychopaths, however his performance here undoubtedly obliterates it from contention. Frances McDormand 's performance is equally significant and Woody Harrelson's contribution broadly impresses, though I struggle to equate it as being on the same standard as his two lead counterparts. Billboards succeeds in delivering a number of startlingly in depth character studies, and it's fascinating to observe the evolutions of a number of these characters throughout the film. <br/><br/>Billboards pertains to a darker, grittier and more realistic tone than Psychopaths, and also opts out of delivering an abundance of humour (be it dark or light). In Psychopaths, dark humour was an extensively underlying component of the film, though in Billboards it largely exists to provide comedic relief from the otherwise relentlessly bleak tone of the narrative, with some degree of success. <br/><br/>The film also hosts some marvellous cinematography that composes some incredible scenes through it's profound manipulation of imagery.<br/><br/>At no point during it's considerable duration did Billboards present any notion of linearity or being contrived, although a number of additional plot twists or other non - linear devices wouldn't have gone amiss. It is not so much a complaint, but more akin to a comparison between how sprawling and non linear Psychopaths was, in relation to the markedly safer approach taken by Billboards. <br/><br/>Billboards is also undoubtedly one of the most emotionally intense and raw films I have seen in recent memory, in stark contrast to the broadly lighter tone adopted by Psychopaths. <br/><br/>Overall, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a remarkably accomplished feat that positions itself as more of a gritty, realistic drama (with thriller elements) than a dark comedy."

","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is the best comedy i have ever seen. A great example of the hollowness of normal comedies and the greatness of black comedies. I have definitely been inspired to watch the two other films of Martin McDonagh and try to check out some of his plays. <br/><br/>Frances McDormand gives an amazing, Oscar-worthy performance, as does Sam Rockwell in perhaps some of the greatest arc acting i have truly ever seen.Music is used quite effectively and the violence is often.

"emkay905","10","1","17","14 December 2017"," An excellent piece of tragicomedy
","From the beginning, i realised this movie's focus wasn't on bringing justice for Angela, it was all about these brilliantly crafted characters and their arcs, a tale of redemption with a witty script filled with hilarious one liners by Martin Mcdonagh. I went into this film not knowing anything other than the fact that it's a film that's been getting rave reviews and praise from regular movie goers. I went to a preview screening of this film, and there was a surprisingly great number of scenes in which the audience erupted into laughter. McDonagh has made a great movie here which explores the complexities of life through protagonists who all lack a hero trait. These characters aren't likable, they're all flawed in their own ways but that's what gives them depth and allows us to resonate with these characters. McDough has crafted a beautiful tale of redemption , keeping us emotionally balanced with witty dialogue which made the movie less intense which i personally enjoyed as some parts got rather depressing. The script didn't try too hard in terms of hamfisting jokes into scenes like a marvel movie, its dark humor worked brilliantly and i was thoroughly entertained throughout.
I never cared for finding out who did Angela wrong, i was so invested in the depth of these characters and their arcs that the main goal of the film's plot felt so unimportant in comparison.
This is a very well crafted original movie, with terrific dialogue, i would highly recommend seeing it with no knowledge of the plot like i did. You'll be in for a treat."

"mdstudio-75425","5","0","1","7 April 2020"," 3 Billboards Outside of The Twilight Zone
","Actually the Twilight Zone had some mysterious endings that were thought provoking. This piece is a typically 21st Century mystery in that the narrative concludes by simply leaving a question mark floating over one's head. Essentially, this is a presentation of two movies more or less about three billboards. The first half is taut and compelling, promising an unfolding epic saga of potently lurid small town evil. As soon as Harrelson offs himself however, the second misfire of a movie is more or less initiated. The acting is solid throughout, yet the motivations and relationships of the characters start veering toward the absurdly inexplicable for the latter half of the tale. The story provides zero redemption for any of its characters and the crime driven/ whodunnit plot is unresolved. Tensions are established, complications ensue, consequences are implied, only to ultimately fade into an unrewarding denouement. Describing this film as a black comedy is only accurate if you interpret black to mean abstruse and comedy to mean not very funny, especially considering the core of the plot concerns rape and murder, but not necessarily in that order. Finally, our two unlikely heroes cheerfully head off into the sunset, maybe to create some further mayhem in a sequel similarly free of atonement."

","I had the whole theatre to myself. So that's something. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri stars Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, and Frances McDormand, which is also directed by Martin McDonagh. This is about a woman who decides to post an advertising to let everybody know that her daughter was raped and murdered. I wanted to see this movie for two reasons: One: I like the work of Martin McDonagh, and Sam Rockwell, who I think is an underrated actor. And I watched this movie and it was different from the movies that Martin McDonagh has done in the past like In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. And those movies had humor as well as a great drama, but this one it doesn't have that much humor to it. There is a little bit of humor, but not much as his other works and I miss that and I wanted to see more of that. Now that isn't to say that this isn't a bad movie. There were moments that were fun to watch and other times where do we need that scene to explain everything. Sam Rockwell and Frances McDormand carry the movie for sure. I think she's a good actress and I haven't seen her in anything in a long time so it was good to see in her in the spotlight. Sam Rockwell is the comedy relief in the movie and the scenes that he's in are fun to watch. You start to hate this character because he's a violent psychopath but later on you start to like him and realize he isn't a bad person. Overall, this was an average movie with good actors, a solid script, and a fun time to watch every now and again."

","Seven months after the rape and murder of Mildred Hayes's daughter the police are no closer to catching the killer. One day Mildred drives past three billboards on a quiet road outside town; it doesn't look as if a new advert has been but up in decades. She goes to the advertising agency in town and tells them she intends to hire all three for a year. Her three adverts say: 'Raped While Dying', 'Still No Arrests?', and 'How Come, Chief Willoughby?'. This immediately gets the attention of the police; Willoughby tries to explain that he has done everything he can but the killers DNA doesn't match any on any national database and there are no other leads, he also tells her he has terminal cancer. His deputy, the violent and bigoted Officer Jason Dixon is angrier and starts threatening Mildred and those close to her. Other townspeople don't like being reminded of the incident and side with the police. As tensions rise things get dangerous and people get hurt... but will it bring Mildred any closer to getting justice for her daughter?<br/><br/>Having seen adverts for this film it didn't particularly appeal but when I was given the DVD as a present I thought I should watch it. As it turned out I really enjoyed the film. The basic premise was interesting but it was the strength of the main characters that made the film so engrossing; and the fact that the protagonists all seemed flawed but not irredeemable only helped. Frances McDormand was on great form as Mildred Hayes; a woman who, fuelled by a sense of righteous outrage goes to extreme measures. Sam Rockwell is equally good as Dixon; a policeman whose anger is matched by his lack of intelligence and Woody Harrelson impresses as chief Willoughby. The story progresses in ways I wasn't expecting; good characters to bad things and bad characters do good things. Some of the things that happen might not be too realistic but when I watch a drama I want a good story so don't mind the odd lapse from what would really happen if somebody did what characters here get away with. The conclusion might be too open for some viewers but it worked for me. If I have one complaint it is that there is a lot of strong language; enough to put off some viewers who would otherwise be drawn to such a story. Overall I thought this was a really good story and would definitely recommend it."

I mean the movie is about a grieving mother, who rents out three billboards in Ebbing, Missouri, advertising the ineptitude (or implying since it was in the form of a question) of the local cops in solving the rape and murder of her daughter seven months before. The cast includes Frances McDormand as the mother who will do anything to get the police's attention back on her daughter's case. Woody Harrelson is the beloved chief of police who's at the twilight of his life due to a terminal illness. Sam Rockwell as the local bully wearing a uniform and has a gun but can't seem to find his badge. There's also Peter Dinklage who may have had lots of free time since Game of Thrones didn't start shooting again until late last year.<br/><br/>Great acting from McDormand. A little overacting from Rockwell. Questionable supporting nominations for him and Harrelson. Hashtag #justiceforMichaelStuhlbarginCMBYN. All in all a good movie but it never really took off for me."

","Fascinating drama about the complexities of the life and the way in which people deal with tragedy and pain. Frances McDormand is absolutely brilliant as the flinty protagonist.<br/><br/>While this comparison will put some off, because of the unjust hate the movie gets from a lot of people, this reminded me a bit of Crash in the way it portrayed people as complex, confused messes of bad and good. The movie has no real answers about the human condition, it just points at it and says, well, ain't that something."
"filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin","8","0","2","23 August 2019"," LEGITIMATE HATE AND PAIN
","In Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, Martin McDonagh strikes limit situations within an emotional universe that intends to be predictable. The truth is that controlled or socially correct behaviors exist only in the imagination or scripts of movies before the 1970s.<br/><br/>The attachment, however, remains and it is common if we become surprised by the hatred within the protagonist Mildred Hayes, a mother from a small town emotionally torn by the brutal death of her daughter Angela, raped while dying.<br/><br/>Frances McDormand gives a human, all too human, tone to a woman who decides to throw all the pain she feels internally into the external environment: she rents out three billboards to charge Sheriff Willoughby for the murder investigation, which she deems ""cold"" seven months later.<br/><br/>The sheriff, played by Woody Harrelson in a way we are not used to seeing him, is a compassionate person, experiencing the cancer drama himself, an illness that will soon kill him. Thus, the antithesis of Mrs. Hayes is represented by police officer Dixon, drunk, violent, able to throw people out the window and still be considered slack by his biased mother.<br/><br/>Within this scenario of pain and violence, there are rare moments of tenderness, as when, arguing with Mildred, Willoughby coughs up blood and is called by her ""babe"". In another scene, Mildred receives an unexpected visit from a deer fawn and jokes that it is an attempt to simulate a reincarnation she knows doesn't exist. But cry.<br/><br/>The sheriff decides to take his own life, which piques the spirits of the small Ebbing community where, as in most inland cities, hate and pain seem to be bad words.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, what seemed impossible happens and antagonists Dixon and Mildred join forces to eliminate a possible, but unlikely, suspect. From the uncertainty itself, but especially from the certainty of a violation of the law that Hayes assumed unknown, comes Mildred's first smile."

","Gave me a brothers Coen feel, I had to check mid trough if their name where attached to it. But no, I think. Martin McDonagh seems to be a writer of the same caliber though, In Bruge is one of my favorite movies and Seven Psychopaths was good too, both violent movies with strange and damaged characters, but also movies with a strong feel of comedy.<br/><br/>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri has a dark and sad subject and is more serious than those other two mentioned. This could easily have been a really heavy drama and would probably still be a great film if soo. But we already seen a few of those like for example Winters Bone, Mystic River, Wind River, to name a few. This movie does instead something different. It keeps this comedic tone trough the whole film, with really funny scenes and with excellent timing and dellivery from the actors, ""dark humor"" off course, in the degree that I don't know if you could call this a comedy by any means at all, and even if I myself didn't really laugh out loud, this comedy that was present trough the whole film, gave this dark and heavy subject of a film a sort of light hearted tone, which was new and interesting, almost a bit weird but still very good, could easily been a fiasco but really worked here. And it also didn't take from impact and message of the film, actually the opposite, it made it more easy to really digest. It is actually masterfully done. And I could also care for all the characters, even though they were all heavely flawd to no extent, kind of like humans can be in real life, it would not be easy to like these characters at all, but still here for some reason, I did, exept one, but he only has two scenes.
Masterfully written, I would say, and with a top notch cast. It's perhaps not a movie I will see again and again, but a damn good movie worth buying to have in one's collection. I think that people that bash this movie either are jealous of the accomplished writing or don't get good writing."

","Acting was spectacular from McDormand and all around cast as well. Woody Harrelson stood out to me the most from the supporting cast. Direction was very nicely done. Writing is subtle & not action packed as you may expect from a crime/drama genre, but it's very well written. Subtlety is a nice touch if done properly (reminiscent of movies like No country for old men and Fargo). It is the small details, underlying messages and nuances that go beyond what you see on the big screen. It's a deep movie driven by ideas.<br/><br/>In my view, it is not a must-watch movie by any means, but I think it's well worth watching once. The storytelling aspect is pretty close to amazing. Just don't expect a lot of fast-paced action, bullets flying or a breakdown of the murder itself (I can't say more without spoiling the movie). Ending is different than what you expect going in and even halfway mark, but I thought it was a nice touch. It is not so predictable as Hollywood movies tend to be as you will see only if you watch it!<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10, which I round up to 9. Check it out!"

"Harry098","8","0","1","12 May 2019"," ENJOYED
","I mildly enjoyed In Bruges (2008) instead of loving it as some people do and I had the same experience with this film. It was good, definitely, and yes I found it's treatment of Sam Rockwell's character a little odd but I would not have given it a Best Picture nomination. Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson give great performances and the screenplay contains some real gems which are the main reasons why you should watch this film. I wanted slightly deeper exploration of certain characters' motives and backstories and I would have liked it if the lead character was less one note but unfortunately this was not to be. Not the most memorable film in the world but features a lot of great talent collaborating and is very watchable despite being about some graphically violent subject material.<br/><br/>Mildred Hayes, Frances McDormand, has grown increasingly frustrated over the lack of progress in the investigation of the rape and murder of her daughter Angela. She places three billboards emblazoned with accusatory statements in a field leading into their town and comes into conflict with the town's reasonable police chief William Willoughby, Woody Harrelson, who is dying of cancer. Volatile, racist Officer Jason Dixon, Sam Rockwell, assaults the homosexual man who allowed Mildred to place the billboards but when tragic circumstances lead to the loss of an important figure Mildred and Dixon will have to unite.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film it was easy to empathize with the lead character's anger and righteous indignation but the introduction of the flawed but sympathetic Willoughby made the film more layered. We see him as a family man and I fully expected him to be the rapist and killer based on this portrayal but when a shocking twist of another nature occurs I felt quite emotional. Harrelson is a great actor, as shown by The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and his brief role in The Thin Red Line (1998), and here he is likable and affable while still seeming like a jaded police chief. The scenes in which he interacts with his family felt mawkish but this was mainly McDonagh's direction and the character serves as a nice counterbalance to the main character.<br/><br/>McDormand is very good in her role as an angry, aggrieved woman but I wanted to see some moments of her relenting or being slightly less than extremely angry. The main character journey in the film is that of Dixon as we see his efforts to track down Angela's murderer become more concerted after he survives a raging fire. This development could work in a film that feels less sentimental but the treatment of his character initially, as a comical racist, makes it strange when we are meant to emotionally invest in his character changing. Obviously he faced serious physical damage but we never see any mental repercussions for his assault of a gay man and when they are placed together in the hospital I did not pity him. Although the final scene is entertaining and suggests that Mildred will be fulfilled I didn't think it should have been as cut and dry as it was when we are meant to see him through new eyes.<br/><br/>McDonagh's direction is assured and the film is paced well despite most scenes ending with Mildred physically abusing someone. The straightforward attitude that McDonagh takes to filmmaking is positive in this day and age where every filmmaker seems as though they are trying to be a young Christopher Nolan and uses non-linear storytelling. The colors of the film are fresh and vibrant with red being the dominant color and the image of the three billboards standing out starkly against the greens of the field. The score didn't have much impact when considering the fact that it received a Best Original Score Academy Award nomination but it's better to be irrelevant than extremely present and awful like in River's Edge (1986).<br/><br/>This is a decent film that you can watch with parents and friends but it's not worth paying extra for, try to catch it on television or on Netflix. I'm glad that this film finally earned Rockwell huge amounts of recognition but I'm not so hot on Vice (2018)."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","0","1","8 March 2019"," A sharp, smart, and relevant movie with complex characters and plot.
","The first film by Martin McDonagh I saw was Seven Psychopaths (2012). I enjoyed how he was able to take the audience through many entertaining twists and turns. For his follow-up film, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017), McDonagh has improved on the twists, as well as the darkness of the comedy contained therein. In fact, the comedy is so dark that at times it was almost uncomfortable to laugh. All this being said, the two areas that make this a standout film are the characters and its complexity.<br/><br/>Let's start with the characters. Almost every single character is introduced in a way that the audience wants to dislike them. And yet, over the course of the film, the significant amount of character development makes the audience root for people who threw individuals out of second-story windows or chucked Molotov cocktails at a police station. Part of what helps in these character developments are the twists that add to the complexity of the story. Nothing is a foregone conclusion in Three Billboards, and in that sense, it has some semblance of reality to it.<br/><br/>On top of these two outstanding characteristics, Three Billboards is also extremely relevant. Set in that portion of mid-west America that seems to embrace the status quo over all else, even if this status quo defends and condones racism, violence, and sexual assault, the fiercely loyal townspeople turn into the real villains. Throughout all of these injustices, a small amount of hope remains, giving many individuals the modicum of energy needed to live in a society that seems to be against them at every turn. It's a good thing this movie had some funny moments because otherwise, it would have been a sad reflection of our current affairs.<br/><br/>A sharp, smart, and relevant movie with complex characters and plot, I give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 5.0 stars out of 5."

","I have seldom found myself so torn in evaluating a movie, nor have I ever so much felt the need to scan the comments of other reviewers.<br/><br/>My initial reaction at the end of the movie was that I had very much enjoyed it, and it would be an automatic 10/10, also that it would give me a lot of food for thought. Overall enjoyability and the ability to provoke thought are two of my major criteria, and I have stuck with my 10/10.<br/><br/>I did feel that its plot had more holes than Blackburn, Lancashire, and that was before I looked on a map of the USA to check up the relative locations of Missouri and Idaho, two states I have never visited (I am Australian) to discover that they are a very long way apart. I agree with all the reviewers here who have laboriously taken the time to list in detail the plot holes. I agree with all the reviewers who haved listed in great detail the very unlikely character behaviour of the principals, and the fact that they were not called to account for their greater excesses. I agree that the sudden road-to-Damascus conversion of one of the principals was the ultimate unlikely eventuality. But then, this was the USA, and if a blatantly corrupt mendacious imbecile can make it to the White House, surely anything is possible there!<br/><br/>But this movie also operates at a totally superior level, and I felt right away that I had been watching a parable. I had been watching the most sharply drawn contasts between good and bad, only to discover that few individuals in this world are uniformly the one or the other. We can all act well, and we can all act badly, and there can be a bit of both in every single one of us. Who are we to judge?<br/><br/>The brief scene with the priest made that point. We might assume that the Catholic church probably does some good some place, but it certainly does a whole lot of bad right here in our society. And when it came to the behaviour of others, who was he to judge?<br/><br/>The final scene in the car, heading to Idaho, with total indecision, everything unresolved, was the perfect ending to a perplexing parable. So un-Hollywood, so understated, so 'now go away and think about this'. And I have.<br/><br/>One footnote - all those complaining that the police chief's wife had a British accent.

At one point, the dark humor was too much, and it became obvious this is an exceptional script and not just one story based on some news.<br/><br/>Sure, the script is the best, but the acting, the editing and the camera are not far below.

","I have always found McDonagh has seemed to at least struggle to translate the mix of comedy abusism and realism found in this stageplays into his movies but it seems like he's found a way to finally edge it in here.<br/><br/>Billboards is a touching, absurd yet realist piece of cinema that touches on all things political and finds room not only to poke fun at them but also give a deep commentary. McDormand, Harrelson, Hedges, and Landry-Jones all give wonderful performances that compliment McDonagh's script brilliantly; so much so that you can find yourself suspending disbelief and getting lost in the absurdity - which is hard to do even in movies like this (Coen Brothers included).<br/><br/>But the real gem here is Sam Rockwell. His performance is why this film touched so many people and grabbed the success it did. His redemption arc may be one of the most powerful and biggest in cinematic history; and it's believable, too.<br/><br/>McDonagh's message seems to be ""everybody deserves a second chance"" and it's very hard to disagree. Great movie."
"antoniotierno","Null","0","3","7 November 2018"," excellent movie
","The script sparkles with a hard-edged humor, so much so that the spasms of violence sometimes feel as if they're going to derail the film. The internet is already alive with ruminations on the film's politics and what the British McDonagh is trying to say about America, race, class, feminism and male prerogative. Set against the backdrop of the sexual harassment and assault scandals roiling the worlds of entertainment and politics, ""Three Billboards"" is especially timely. However whatever one's personal politics and despite McDonagh's cinematic hyperbole, it's the strength of the performances from McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell that keeps ""Three Billboards"" sturdily anchored in a compellingly rendered reality. But while that is a rage that's exhilarating to witness, it's a rage unavailable to everyone. Just as not everyone in Ebbing can claim the protection of being considering ""good,"" we still don't live in a world where everyone gets to be angry."

","The text of those three billboards establishes a narrative but, though that's the starting point for Martin McDonagh's stellar Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, it doesn't hint at the film's eventual trajectory, that has eventually, shocking moments, karmic twists, and redemption. Thus far, the movie industry hadn't offered anything close to the experience provided by this film, which effectively traverses a high wire between tragedy and comedy. And it does so without a safety net. Outside the Coen Brothers, it's hard to find a filmmaker with that skill and with this production. Frances McDormand is by far the star of the film, so talented that she is absolutely supreme with her layered mother struggling to deal with a daughter's death. Overall something close to a masterpiece."

","The movie exhibits life in its most crude and real form. Despite all the good reason and justice in the killer being caught, he is actually never caught and justice is not served despite the viewer very moved because of this. In a movie generally things go ideal. People who are good get the better and vice-versa. In this movie, this did not happen and the viewer is taken aback by it and has some sort of discomfort accepting the closing of the film. You can feel the pain of the mother and feel all the reason she should get justice and absolution but it just does not happen. About the racist cop, many people will feel that he did not do anything for redemption but is still portrayed as a good character in the end. But i feel that he never had to do anything for redemption. The movie is not about racism and portraying what is correct. He does change but juwt not in the racist way perhaps but in the way that he does realises his negelction of his duty and this is just another form of redemption.<br/><br/>The movie is brutal and real and thwt is perhaps ehat the viewer connects to the most."

"vandalz","10","0","2","9 September 2018"," Brilliant, black comedy/drama
","Anyone who thinks this is an homage (or ripoff) of a Coen Brothers movie is watching the movie very superficially. True, it's a black comedy/drama, starring Francis McDormand, but that's where the comparison begins and ends. Three Billboards has far more in common with the director's own ""In Bruges"" than any Coen Brothers movies.<br/><br/>This movie challenges you to examine how your initial impression of people can be very wrong. Additionally, it shows that even the most despicable characters can be capable of redemption (or at least a partial redemption). Sam Rockwell is outstanding as a thuggish policeman who is ill equipped to handle the significant events unfolding around his life. Writer/Director Martin McDonough takes Officer Dixon (Rockwell) through some significant life-changing events without relying on a tired redemption arc. Rockwell handles this character development adroitly, and we see why he was a runaway winner for ""Best Supporting Actor"" at the 2018 Oscars. <br/><br/>Francis McDormand's character Mildred is unrelentingly bitter, but considering the pain her character is enduring, the pain and anger is justified. Woody Harrelson is a standout as embattled Police Chief Willoughby. The relationship between Mildred and Chief Willoughby, like much of the movie, only seems one-dimensional, until we realize there's much more affection between the two than we've been led to believe."

","As many of the other favorable reviews will testify, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri works well on the surface level as a drama. But there is much more to the story than that! This is a parable about the evil that is destroying America.<br/><br/>A small town in Missouri represents the heart of America. It's being ripped apart by a hatred born of an unidentified evil that has destroyed the life and future of Mildred Hayes. Meanwhile, in the words of Chief Willoughby, we are cowards who, instead of controlling our own destiny, watching silently as life ""ebbs"" away. 
In the words of a naive minor character, ""Hate begets more hate!"" And the hate is personified by a Flannery O'Connor-type character, similar to the Satanic villain in her story ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"" (which Red Welby is reading when we meet him in the billboard rental office).<br/><br/>Deputy Jason (not Mason!) Dixon has marinated in the racial anger of the Old South. He explodes in violence when he senses that the death of his mentor and protector spells the end of his white privilege. Willoughby's replacement is a black man, alienating Dixon even more and resulting in his being fired. But one line in a Chief Willoughby letter changes Dixon: he has to learn to love, because loving makes one slow down. And even though the new police chief trusts in a system that conspires to protect the Devil, Dixon senses that evil must be confronted.<br/><br/>The old South is burned down, and the ""Missouri rabbit"" has been destroyed. Finally Dixon's newly discovered ability for ""slow and steady"" analysis, while his mother's tortoise settles into her lap, lets him recognize the Devil and form an alliance to identify and stop him."

","When I put this one in our Netflix queue, I was expecting a gritty little yarn about a part of the country that's rarely seen onscreen (unless you happen to be watching ""Sharp Objects"" on HBO), something like ""Winter's Bone,"" only down toward the flatlands and a little bit further north. What with the reviews and awards and all, I must've lost sight of the fact that the film was W&D'd by Anglo-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, also the creator of splashy Tarantinian fantasies like ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths."" My bad!<br/><br/>The overall shoddiness of the script, the stagy dialogue and the characters' loony behavior completely undercut the technical virtuosity on display, from the admittedly fine performances to the cinematography and soundtrack. TV and movies have taught us that small-town cops commit random acts of violence with impunity, especially in a vaguely Southern setting; in Ebbing, that privilege seems to be extended to civilians as well, which may be why the victims seem so understanding when, e.g., somebody tosses them out a window or firebombs a building they happen to be sitting in...<br/><br/>Two characters--not portrayed as otherwise admirable in any way--who have been victims of brutal, irrational assaults make large or small gestures of forgiveness; one of them bonds with his attacker and sets off on an open-ended quest that brings the film to its baffling conclusion. I'm guessing that what McDonagh had in mind was some sort of action-packed parable about violence, repentance and forgiveness, but ""Crime and Punishment"" it's not.<br/><br/>That being said, it looks like the critics have finally gotten it right--the last capsule review I saw (NYT) just read, ""Exhausting.""

","To think about it!<br/><br/>It has some awesome things:<br/><br/>1-The characters aren't angels or demonds. All the protagonists have good and bad traits. You know, like most humans! This shouldn't be such a rarity on film, but it totally is!<br/><br/>2-The funny parts (not always done to make you laugh out loud, which is the way it should be) do not require ""out of character"" stuff. Everything that is funny its really the logical conclusion of the funny situations the characters are in, and their normal responses. That's why this deserves a lot of praise for the writing, which is insanely good (except for a couple of huge mistakes)<br/><br/>3-Then there's the drama/story which is perfectly paced and it has social commentary, but I'm not sure that part is neither revolutionary nor especially interesting. Its good.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty great overall.<br/><br/>Now the bad:
-There is a particularly female character that is treated like an idiot for no apparent reason other than make some laugh at her. It seems malicious more than social commentary on that type of personality. Because she isn't a person, really, the way she's writen.
-The Friends of our ""hero?"" are DIVERSE. Its too on the nose, and really not particularly interesting giving that they aren't allowed to even be characters (they do little to nothing). They are ""token diversity"" and that's unfair. If you don't have those characters in the script, why bother to do this fake inclusion stuff?

","This movie is well-acted, well-filmed, well-paced. Literally no complaints in these areas. The only minor issue I have are some script choices-McDormand's character has some quips that would seem better suited to a Jane Austin novel were it not for the constant f-words thrown in. And while the characters are quite complex and evolved well throughout the film, their spoken occasionally seem effusive for no real reason. <br/><br/>But some script issues aside, this film was difficult to watch. Not because of the violence, or the subject matter. But because it is a story of characters completely consumed by grief, unfulfilled desires, hopelessness, and futility. This concept is not necessarily original, but the film provides an interesting story and definitely kept me engaged. <br/><br/>The main thing to enjoy about this film is that all the characters are portrayed as flawed, deeply disturbed individuals, all finding was to cope with existence. Moving from one crisis to the next, they deal with life, make their mistakes, and continue on. My biggest issue (outside the script) is that no real people ""make this many mistakes"" and don't go to jail. The film portrays Missouri as a sort of wild-west atmosphere where people take the law into their own hands (Molotov cocktails, arson, battery on minors while on school grounds throwing people out of windows-all done with literally no legal ramifications) This kind of behavior is just simply not the case any more in this country, and so it is an incredible suspension of disbelief being requested on the part of the viewer. <br/><br/>But as a film, I thoroughly enjoyed it for the most part-if not solely for the acting of McDormand and Rockwell."

","A small town (especially a small town in America) is a specific place, and British-Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh takes full advantage of this in his renowned and much-awarded ""Three Billboards..."" However, Ebbing, Missouri does not exist, and McDonagh actually went a long way from Missouri to film in Sylva, North Carolina, where the population is apparently about 2600. <br/><br/>That begins to tell you something about this movie, but back - for now - to the concept of everybody knowing everybody else, being at school with them, raised with them, knowing their strengths and weaknesses, family background and everything else. And McDonagh's awareness of this and his ability to build it into his film is where the brilliance shones through. ""Three Billboards"" repeatedly gains a description as part ""dark comedy"" that was hard for this reviewer to discern at all, but is moreover a disappointing oversimplification. For the joy here is not an amazing Francis McDormand as Mildred Hayes being perpetually (and non-comedically) rude and violent and unpleasant and at times near-psychopathic to the cops in her town (perhaps somewhat justifiably, but anyway); but rather the way that she at times shows sympathy for them, and even in fact teams up with them. This is not especially funny either, but is just how it would be. Pure hate can't work/be sustained in a town of 2600, where people have put up with each others' good and bad for years. So if something new-bad-shocking happens something has to give so that a new balance can talk hold in the community, and it is McDonagh's genius to be able to portray that, as well as McDormand's huge skill to ensure the tough-as-old-boots facade slip just occasionally. <br/><br/>Of course both director and lead star are helped out greatly with this by SUPERB work by Woody Harrelson as the Police Chief, and Sam Rockwell and Zeljko Ivanek as other cops. Peter Dinklage is also interesting in his role, who is a pretty blameless character surrounded by people who are certainly to be blamed for what they have done.<br/><br/>And that brings me to the downsides here - and the more you think about them, the more they get to you. It is no secret/not much of a spoiler to mention that Mildred is a heroine because she has been terribly wronged and permanently wounded by the loss of her daughter in awful circumstances, and the failure of the Police to do much about it; but her behaviour at worst is unheroic in the extreme (also occasionally unrealistic); while the person she holds most responsible - Harrelson's Willoughby - emerges repeatedly as heroic. This is a classy twist, and within the bounds of acceptability. In contrast, a willingness to forgive the Sam Rockwell character for some greater good IS indeed potentially realistic in a small-town context, but it's also PLAIN WRONG. We are looking in on the world of Ebbing from the outside, and we know that there is bad stuff going on there, and we can only be uncomfortable with any accommodation of that.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the most telling point. <br/><br/>I believe I am not the only person in the world to have come to this film considering it was basically a true story. But it isn't. <br/><br/>The best we can say is that it resembles the story of James Fulton - the FATHER of murder victim Kathy Page, and the funder of billboards and signs condemning police in Vidor, Texas. Now Kathy suffered a very unpleasant death, but it seems the yet-more-far-reaching perversion and unpleasantness surrounding the death of our movie's victim Angela Hayes is basically out of the heads of the makers. <br/><br/>It is therefore their (ir)responsibility to depict a crime that is presumably not inconceivable, but beyond the capacity of my mind to conceive of. Presumably pretty much every other audience member for ""Three Billboards"" is in the same boat.<br/><br/>For me that takes the edge off this film, brilliant though it indeed is - hence the 8, rather than the 10."

","It was one of the better movies I've seen in that it plays on nostalgia and not nostalgia to a bygone decade, but more nostalgia for the old story driven indie and quasi-indie films that ruled the 1990s.<br/><br/>Back in the day ""Pulp Fiction"" could win Academy Awards and tiny no budget movies like ""Clerks"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" could gain cult followings and make long and successful careers out of their writer-directors.<br/><br/>""Three Billboards"" has all of that, the story based on characters and situations not based on political rhetoric and special effects. You get the sense, when you watch it, that they wanted to tell a story and that was all that mattered to them.<br/><br/>There was a story to tell and everyone came together to tell it in the best way that they could...so it was moving, and it was funny, and it was dramatic, and it was oddly dark and oddly heartwarming. <br/><br/>You walk away feeling that you've seen a movie, and you have. That's exactly what this is, an actual movie. It's not special effects strung together on the backs of weak characters playing out a plot that has been rebooted several times...it's an actual movie that tells an actual story.<br/><br/>It's original. It's worth watching. It deserved everything that came its way at the rewards and more. It's the kind of movie that we need to see more of and its the kind of movie that I dearly miss seeing.<br/><br/>Give it a watch, you won't see a movie like it again, and that, I feel, is time well spent."

","By far one of my favorite movies from 2017 (and, truth be told, that year was very good for the movies themselves) which revolves around well written characters and even better written story and scenario. There are no shallow characters and all of them, even minor ones have the depth in their own unique way. To be quite honest, I didn't even expect much from this movie, considering that I wasn't very fond of McDonagh's other feature film (which is quite popular and one of his most famous movie, if not the most known and favorite among many) In Bruges. When I sat in the cinema along with my friend and (apparently) many who knew what to expect, the movie started with its very dark, yet oddly humorous tone, which was present throughout the entire movie (which serves only as an anesthetic to the generally dark and bitter story of loss). The humorous aspect is mostly thanks to probably one of the best written characters in 2017 - officer Jason Dixon portrayed by Sam Rockwell, who was ahead of anybody in The Best Supporting Actor category and definitely deserved this award. I don't think I have seen such a colorful and changeable character in a while. One of the many examples to attest this was one quite loud person in the public who literally wanted that character to die as soon as possible, and then, during a specific scene, which was the key one for Dixon, she literally started crying after seeing a possibility that he may not end up well (or even die). What a change of character! Kudos to Sam Rockwell. Frances McDormand was also among those who made this movie, with her somewhat antipathetic, yet persistent appearance, as a ""lady who never smiles"", which is, as far as I remember Fargo (the film), a role quite opposite to the one there, but still Oscar-worthy performance. Of course, the other Oscar (for her) was also deserved without a debate. So, as the film ended, I felt like a truck hit me, so many mixed feelings prevail, and definitely this movie made me think about it for a while and definitely would recommend to everyone. I felt rather displeased that Martin McDonagh didn't win in at least one out of three categories (billboards?), because he sure did deserve that.<br/><br/>DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers"

","Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is a profane poem that stares genuinely in the face of grief, despair, and vengeance. It is ideally viewed as a complex meditation of a mother's most primal pain and path of redemption. The film squats into vile pain, the very burning embers of grief and derogatory assumptions that shape the very narrative of the movie while unchaining small realities and profound realities through its course. We get a rather intricate painting painted mostly in grey which specifically decorates on the cruelties born within societies and how immortally they tend to last.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mildred (Francis McDormand) lost her daughter when the girl was raped, murdered and set ablaze. A trio of old, battered and dusty billboards stand in the misty morning fog on a sparsely traveled road which piques Mildred's interest to take a stand to pursue justice for her departed daughter. She displays no dubiousness to adorn the billboards with the words- ""Still no arrests?"", ""How come, Chief Willoughby?"" Topped with ""Raped while dying"". The billboards were a clear attack on the complacency Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) and his police force displayed on her daughter's case, leading to Willoughby losing his mind over it, and that is where the movie leads.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Woody Harrelson carefully tailored his character to have the ""tough-but-tender"" outlook, which is something we don't see often from him. The dying, conflicted cop attitude simply added depth to his character when his sympathy projected towards Mildred and his futile efforts to find the culprits responsible for her daughter's death. Francis McDormand's character confidently stood its ground, with a very relatable embodiment of a woman on whom the walls of grief have zeroed in, which seemed unbreakable and impenetrable. Her fluent approach to shifting between comedy and tragedy even in the most disturbing situations makes her performance a soulfully convincing one, a standout. Nixon, a low IQ, mama's boy, the racist cop has perhaps one of the most interesting character arcs ever witnessed. His periodic transformation throughout the film was remarkable, even non-feasible seeming at times yet never crossing the lines of credibility. The showcasing of how his path converges with Mildred proves there's hope for humanity after all.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The movie often plays its violent delights alongside dark comedy twisting laughs that kindle the dark humor in us in depressing and surprising ways. The juxtaposition of these two raw elements provokes us to question the very losses we have faced in life and adding a layer of reality. The obscure narrative simply overrides any form of clichéd theatricality which is something very fresh in the genre considering it is a movie mainly driven by emotions (even though it is of a singular person).<br/><br/>The premise never vacillates to unfold its seemingly simple plot with different subsets, be it racism, male chauvinism, acceptance, incompetency or even disregard of civil rights. The lightest of colors of hope successfully manage to deceive and fade into black and white and eventually feeding most of the grey. All of its plot, elements, characters, and arcs are painted in big, bold black letters in a blood red background in the bleak but beautiful fictional town Ebbing.<br/><br/>
Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri is masqueraded by the vague outline of a revenge film, yet it kaleidoscopically manages to shift its ambitions and emotions leading to a less reckless ending. It is a carefully choreographed tribal dance around the fire about female righteousness and masculine power. One of its successes is owed to the testing of your very perspective about how we tend to judge people unknowingly of what truly drives them. A food for thought watch owing to its provocative subject matter and eclectic performances."
"okamiokami","8","0","1","20 June 2018"," Amazing tale of redemption
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a movie about making extreme choices and dealing with the consequences.
As other reviewers noted, character development reaches new heights here.
All characters, no matter how negative they appear, or how badly they behave, get the chance to show their good side.
The movie starts with a pretty grim settings: the mother of a raped and murdered teen-ager is ravaged by guilt and tries to expedite the investigation (a 7 months old case with no leads and no witnesses) by renting three billboards on a secondary road (where her daughter was murdered on her way home) and displaying three (barely) legal taunting signs addressed to the chief of police.
The main characters are all wonderfully cast (Frances McDormand as the bereaved mother, Woody Harrelson as the chief of police and Sam Rockwell as the dim-witted, macho, racist and closet homosexual cop).
The director plays with stereotypes, but the only constant is that in the end almost all are broken. There is decency in every single character: the letters from the grave by Chief Willoughby are particularly touching, and so are the displays of forgiveness by the two characters that (physically) suffer the most in the movie.
All the individuals are given a chance to redeem themselves (and they make good use of it), with the exception of the unspecified townsfolk.
Small town people cannot stick to their own business, so what should have been a direct confrontation becomes a confrontation between factions, with the typical mob behaviour that is so American.
The ending shows that even in the worst possible scenario there is still hope. 
With the rapid decline of our civilisation, we can only believe it's true."

","What an extraordinary event this movie was. Tight and gripping, hardcore, with a lot of the type of 'humour' that is actually more 'real life' oddball-ness.
I wouldn't call this a comedy by any stretch of the imagination... is that how people who are saying so, write it off as 'unlikely human behaviour?' Perhaps. 
This is more like the reality of how humans behave, than not. if our anger, rages, horrors, insanities and highly emotional dramas were filmed in the day to day we'd recognise why we have such high crime rates, divorces etc.
Back to the movie: nothing short of brilliant in so many ways. Never, at any point can you take this movie's plot for granted. Just when you get all cosy and think you know the 'formula' it shift and throws you a curve ball!

","Great acting, great third act, and great to look at. What falls short is the script and direction.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw with this film is it does not have an identity. Is it a world with comical characters who say the darndest things, or is it a drama packed full of emotion? The drama in this movie is so terribly out of place. Or is it the comedy that is out of place? I couldn't tell. If you want to make a dark comedy or dramedy, you need to weave humor into the plot, not make it an addition. <br/><br/>In his other film, In Bruges, humor was built in to the plot. One of the characters was a whiny man-child who wanted things to go his way. His personality led the way to create funny situations. In Three Billboards though you have a police chief, who we are led to believe is greatly deserving of respect, who ends up making witty quips about serious topics and curses at his children. There is a disconnect between the humor and the plot/characters that just makes it hard to enjoy."

We can't really connect with the characters because every time something important happens, a joke is made about it and then the film just moves on. The performances are good, but I don't think that Frances McDormand should have won best actress.

","A lot of very high reviews on imdb.com for this movie but it is not as good as it seems.
The storyline is interesting about a mother who rents three bilboards to put up texts in order to force the local police to come into action to investigate the death of het daughter closer.
The sheriff has cancer and has two little daughters but does not much about the case. His deputy Dixon is a real asshole and it is unreliable that he is not fired.
It is also very unreliable that he changes his attitude 180 degrees only because of the letter he receives after rhe suicide of the sheriff.
And than there is the violent ex-husband of the mother and this unpleasant man has a 19-year old good-looking but dumb girl on his side. Yeah, right...
The mother sets the police-station on fire and almost kills the deputy but the new sheriff does not even check het story although she is at the scene of the crime and the obvious suspect.
And than there is the more or less open ending, a phenomenon that you see more lately but what I absolutely dislike!
For me this movie was, after all the positive rating and talk about it, a disappointment.
An interesting movie with however too many implausibilities and an unsatisfactory more or less open ending."
"view_and_review","7","0","1","20 March 2018"," Mercurial Mildred
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri starts off with Mildred (Frances McDormand) renting these three abandoned billboards for a full year with monthly payments of $5000. On the billboards she's calling out the Ebbing police chief, Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), for not solving the rape and murder of her daughter. That's jarring in any place but it's especially jarring in a small town like Ebbing, MO where everybody knows everybody.<br/><br/>Right away I was with Mildred. I've read enough true crime books to know that one of the best ways to get a major crime solved is by putting pressure on law enforcement, either through the media or by bothering them. John Wayne Gacy was captured because of a relentless mother that wouldn't let the police rest until her son was found. Most police are either overworked or underfunded to give the required attention to every case. So, if a parent, spouse, or loved one doesn't let the case die neither will the police. <br/><br/>And Mildred went for maximum effect by calling out the police chief instead of just simply asking for justice. This made her public enemy number one in Ebbing. But it was clear that Mildred was long past caring what anyone--especially anyone in Ebbing--thought about her. The impression she gave off was that she'd been disappointed and let down so much in her life that she no longer cared about what people said or thought about her. It was evident in her dress and her demeanor. She didn't make herself up, she didn't wear feminine clothing and she was very rough and coarse toward everyone.<br/><br/>To many this would make her character a bit of a heroine. A woman that says what she wants to when she wants to and publicly appears how she wants to is a sign of liberation for many. But there was a down side to Mildred's approach; and that is: you attract more flies with honey than you do with a bazooka. This is not to say she should've been dolled up and overly demure to everyone, no. The fact is the town of Ebbing was with her yet they loved the chief as well. Ebbing wasn't satisfied with such a heinous crime occurring in their town. Maybe a good chunk of them were too impotent when it came to rolling up the sleeves and pursuing justice but they certainly weren't for the rape and murder of one of their own. Mildred was so surly and confrontational that it was counterproductive. She had suffered a lot in her life as was evident and she was at wit's end but the path she embarked upon was a path of isolation and self-destruction.<br/><br/>Mildred was a mercurial character. She couldn't be ignored by anyone: those in Ebbing or the audience watching the film. Her character was bold and jumped off the screen; shoot, I just wrote a few paragraphs about just her. The movie was good and I thought all of the performances were good, not just Frances McDormand."

"bgtopteam","7","0","1","16 March 2018"," Nice film, some of the best of the year
","With the constantly degrading quality of the film industry, this movie was a breath of fresh air, and it kept me interested till the end. The acting was great and the dialogues were mostly well thought.
There are a couple of unforgivable movie sins that just have to be mentioned.
You just not write a movie without an ending. Period. And speaking of endings, if you are on-your-way-to-redemption ex-cop racist, killing some rapist who is 100% not the guy you are looking for just doesn't fit the bill. What would your beloved dead boss say about that? Is this the interpretation of the message of love? 
Second, you just do not go to the adds agent, ask for the price of the billboards, and after he admits they haven't been rented in 50 years, throw 5 Gs at him for 1 month. This is stupidity that diminished the main character.
Third, you just don't bring Clarke Peters in a detective movie only to have him fire some idiot. The guy caught Avon fkin Barksdale, for Christ's sake, and I am sure had we given him just a little more time, this case was going places. 
Which brings me to the final unforgivable sin - making a murder/detective movie with a plot that does not involve ANY actual development in the investigation. Just left me lacking something.
I am fine when the characters in a movie look out of time. Although the movie suggested level of technology somewhere in the 80s, the cops behaved as if it was the era of ""Deadwood"". There were some cell phones and googling towards the end, and I assume it was intentional - an artistic jump, I guess. I can also tolerate the lack of authentic accent and the fact that the colored people looked out of place, as well as the australian? widow of Willoughby. It is the when the Russians in a movie speak to each other in broken English with bad Russian accent where I draw the line. 
There is a little discrepancy in the plot worth mentioning. There is some magical force keeping the cops from destroying the billboards, while at the same time they have no problem throwing the agent out of the window and using all kinds of harassment tactics to make people remove them. And they are just fine with some lady setting their whole department on fire. I tolerate this artistic freedom as long as it does not contradict the reality of the movie. 
Some not so random guy harasses Mildred and looked out of place at first. But the guy is a rapist pscycho, who most definitely heard the news, so there is still some plausibility to his actions, although it only adds a little drama. 
The movie was well filmed, very watchable, and what has become one of my most important attributes of movies in recent times, lacked empty conversations of the ""you just don't kill people"" type. I am convinced that if you want to write a 9/10 grade film, say Cohen brothers level, you just don't have time in a 2-3 hour movie for scenes with dears in the middle of nowhere reflecting about incarnation.
There is another semi sin I decided to include here. I am unfortunately quite familiar with pancreatic cancer, and can testify that the sheriff was not even remotely close ti the final stages of the disease. And although I sympathize with his decision to end it before it gets ugly, I still feel a father would have more to say to his daughters in his final hours than ""don't move out of the god damn blanket"". And if you can still have decent sex with your wife... I mean, the sheriff jumped the gun a little there."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","16 March 2018"," Performances Are Its Strongest Suit. And Also Its Saving Grace.
","Drenched in pitch black humour & treading on thin ice throughout its runtime, Martin McDonagh's third feature film manages to be disturbing & amusing at the same time but not all its attempts at humour hit the right spot and the ones that do, their effect don't last for long.<br/><br/>The story of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri follows a grieving mother who, infuriated by the lack of progress in the still unsolved case of her daughter's murder, challenges the local authorities by making a bold move that not only irks the ire of the police but also the town's residents.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges & Seven Psychopaths), Three Billboards begins on a promising note but the more we learn about its characters, the less interested we are to stay on board. McDonagh's dark humour may be too much to handle for some but it suffers from tonal inconsistency.<br/><br/>Characters are as colourful as they are despicable, the interaction between them is sharp, at times unforgiving & seething with anger but the change they undergo over the course of the film's runtime is so hurried that it's not convincing enough. Its dark wit may be too dark for some but when it clicks, it's absolutely rib-tickling.<br/><br/>The film's real strength, however, is the strong performances by its talented cast. Leading from the front is Frances McDormand in a showcase that's brimming with charged aggression. Woody Harrelson & Sam Rockwell chip in with terrific inputs of their own, and it's a battleground of wits whenever either of them share space with McDormand.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is neither as wild & refreshing as In Bruges nor packs as interesting a set of characters as they were in Seven Psychopaths. Performances are its strongest suit & possibly its saving grace too, for the writing, dialogues & humour fail to leave their mark in what's possibly Martin McDonagh's weakest film to date."

Magically, five or ten minutes later Dixon is in a bar after he loses his job and over-hears someone bragging about something that happened similarly 18 months previously!! <br/><br/>Something tells me the writers thought they had a great premise (I agree it is) but weren't sure how they wanted the film to end so had to contrive up a sudden change in character that would lead to what they thought might be satisfying ending but I didn't think so. <br/><br/>To me that is incredibly poor writing and could have been handled so much better than it was.<br/><br/>It is a two hour film but I start to get uncomfortable if I feel it drags on for to long and it dragged. The last 45 minutes or so it was starting to run out of steam."

","While this movie is very well made and acted. It felt like it dragged in many parts. But it was an amazing movie non-the-less. You feel what the main character feels. She does an amazing job acting. There wasnt a single person that wasnt convincing. The twist and turns are very well done. The ending leaves you hanging though. I would like to see a sequel, but with this type of artistic movie, a sequel will ruin everything."

","I love McDonagh movies. They're fresh, funny, sad and touching, and you can never predict what's gonna happen next. In Bruges is a real masterpiece. Here I was expecting the same given the amazing reviews. Unfortunately, it is a bit watered down. The jokes didn't really hit home for me. Many of them are racial jokes aimed at making the audience uncomfortable, like in Get Out, but still... And during the whole movie I felt like it was held back. Acts don't have consequences, no one dies that shouldn't die. And my initial prediction of the movies proved correct : they never catch the murderer, and once you hear about Idaho and their plan to go there, you know the movie will end right here, that there won't be a last act outside Ebbing. The performances of the actors save the movie, and a few scenes are funny. But some characters don't hit home : the son, the 19 year old bimbo, or the replacement police chief. I didn't connect with them, and I didn't have as much empathy for the mother as I had for characters in In Bruges (all of them)."

","Superb acting all around by the entire cast. Great dialogues but the ending is a disappointment. It just fizzles out. The viewers need closure"
"Hawkensian","7","0","3","17 January 2018"," An engrossing drama that's marred by crude dialogue, dubious casting and wayward narrative shifts
","The first thing that must be said about Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is that it is a step in the right direction for Martin McDonagh. Everyone loved In Bruges, it was a perfect blend of the dark and the humourous, and it had a lot of heart, too. However, that pathos was lost in his sophomore feature Seven Psychopaths, which favoured cineliterate metafiction and frivolous pop-culture gags. <br/><br/>A cursory read of the synopsis will tell you that Three Billboards is more than a return to the dark tragedy of his debut. Indeed, just the title suggests that McDonagh has once again made the location of his story a character in itself, only this time we have the verdant mountains of the Deep South (it was filmed in North Carolina) rather than the spires and canals of medieval Bruges. <br/><br/>This sweeping backdrop is stage to a vicious yarn about small town America and small town attitudes. In short, it is about Mildred, a tough, belligerent woman who uses a provocative message spread across three billboards with the aim of reigniting the search for her daughter's murderer(s). Again, Mildred doesn't suffer fools gladly, but just when you think that there are no cracks in her granite veneer, the textured interplay of McDonagh's characters start to reveal them. This is especially true of Mildred's relationship with Sheriff Willoughby, which, despite all the public mud slinging, has an underlying respect and mutual schadenfreude sense of humour. Their chemistry has a particularly poignant depth when Mildred swiftly drops her prickly facade to comfort him in a desperate moment. Scenes like these are the highlights of Three Billboards. <br/><br/>However, there are several problems with the film both small and large. Firstly, there's too much swearing. It may well be an honest depiction of the way these people speak, yet much of the incessantly crude language seem to be played for the laughs, and it didn't elicit many from me. Secondly, there are several questionable castings, namely Abbie Cornish - who is too young and too Australian to be a credible wife to Woody Harrelson's characte. Even more egregious is Samara Weaving's performance as Penelope, the stupid young girlfriend of Mildred's white trash ex-husband. Again, she is just not credible; a girl with her kind of wholesome attractiveness just wouldn't be with a scummy lowlife like Charlie - she needed to be brassier. The worst thing about her character, though, is how flatly written she is. In fact, she's not a character but a cheap, ditsy punchline delivered with wide-eyed obviousness.<br/><br/>The third and most problematic issue, however, lies with the narrative. There are two important acts of violence in the film, Jason Dixon's brutal assault of Red and Mildred's firebombing of the police station. One can see how these violent set-pieces serve as the nadir of the each character's tempestuous personality, but they largely go unaccounted for. These are both serious crimes, yet Jason merely loses his job and Mildred is barely even questioned; I'm sorry, but such drastic crimes would have interrupted and overruled whatever was happening beforehand. Some may argue that such narrative matters should be overlooked, but credibility matters. <br/><br/>These flaws prevent Three Billboards from entering great movie territory, but Martin McDonagh's third effort remains a well-acted and engrossing drama that sometimes hits the same darkly humourous notes of his superb debut."

","Good comic tragedy. Good Performances. Should be ninety minutes, tops. 
Heavy handed with the identity politics. When will it ever end....
A tighter ninety script with great scenes with a three act structure like that of, 
The Wrestler could have improved Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."
"Lewis_Heather787","7","0","4","27 December 2017"," Dark, Funny, Shocking with great directing and acting overall !
","This film is an awards bait film so that is why I personally decided to give it a go, completely missed the trailers for it and didn't know much before going in. Overall it is a decent film......a good film actually.<br/><br/>I'll quickly get the praise for the writing and directing over and done with, yes both elements in the film are strong and good. They will probably earn some award nominations and its probably deserved, however for me they were not standout elements. Nothing wrong with them, just fine.<br/><br/>The performances are obviously the central part and focus of the film, which starts with a heart breaking yet oddly interesting premise of a murder and a police department running out of resources and leads. Sam Rockwell for me personally is the standout of the film, even though in the beginning he is a bit of a moron. You begin to follow him throughout the film dealing with the case and his day to day routine. As the film progresses you begin to see past the rough exterior and see that there is a desperate man underneath trying to do the right thing, Rockwell's performance throughout is brilliant. Starting of as a idiot and turning out to be a guy trying to so the right thing is quite powerful considering he almost gets killed.<br/><br/>Talking of people getting killed or killing themselves, Woody Harrelson's character is your run of the mill cop, but the shocking and extremely surprising suicide of the character is gut wrenching. It was completely out of nowhere but served the story so well and actually gave the film a change of pace it so desperately needed. Very well handled.<br/><br/>Even though the film is extremely dark, lets be honest its about the repercussions of a young woman being raped and murdered its not exactly light hearted. The hints of comedy now and then in the film work extremely well and are placed perfectly throughout. For example the ex-husbands new 19 year old girlfriend is just hilarious. <br/><br/>Unfortunately there are couple big negatives of the film that let it down for me and are the reason for not giving it a better mark. Firstly the character portrayed by Frances McDormand, she is completely horrible to everyone including her own family throughout the film. Oh wait until the very final frame of the film she is nice. I personally could not connect or empathise towards the character at moment because she is a monster. The actions the character takes throughout the film are nasty especially when tries to burn down the police department, I don't feel sorry for her at any moment. Its has nothing to do with McDormand's performances no I think she does a great job its just the characters decisions and actions throughout the film are terrible.<br/><br/>Lastly the film is quite slow and does drag at times, which is not good for repeat viewings of the film which is the last negative against it. Overall its a good film 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, it has good directing and writing with one standout performance from Sam Rockwell with a great twist with Woody Harrelson. However the unlike-ability of the central character and the slow dragging pace of the film make it difficult to watch again."
