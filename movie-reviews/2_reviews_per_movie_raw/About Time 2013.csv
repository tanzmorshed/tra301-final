","I hate this movie.<br/><br/>Why might you ask have I rated it 10/10 then? Because it is possibly the most completely wonderful story I have ever watched.<br/><br/>I'm getting on now, I'm a guy in my late 30's who is into action and violence and explosions and big robots smashing things and never before have I seen a movie which moved me to tears.<br/><br/>There were elements which reminded me of silly things which I have done in the past and wished I could have done over, moments I wish I could relive and times I wish I could get - even writing this makes me want to cry! Damn you Richard Curtis, you've made me into a sissy with your perfect casting in this bloody beautiful, touching movie!!!<br/><br/>I don't usually do sentimentality but this isn't the reason I hate this movie... No I hate this movie because I think it has replaced the Princess Bride as my no. 1! And yes I know that was a soppy romance but it had pirates in it so it was fine!!!<br/><br/>See this movie."
"steve-atkinson-814-726592","10","811","918","11 October 2013"," The reason you go to the movies
","Why do you go to the cinema? For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect - it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues. It's the reason you go to the cinema."
"YJLcool","8","294","340","21 September 2013"," a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart
","From the director of 'Love Actually', who is also the writer of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Bean', 'Notting Hill' and the 'Bridget Jones' films, it sure raises some expectations for this particular fantasy romantic comedy drama film about time travel. <br/><br/>Although it shares some similarities with 'The Time Traveler's Wife' (the same female lead actress, Rachel McAdams) and 'Groundhog Day', but rest assured, 'About Time' is a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart. The script was well written, the direction was great and the casts made a decent performance in their respective roles. <br/><br/>The film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story, providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running time.<br/><br/>Despite the time-traveling plot device, the story focuses on the father-son relationship of Tim and his dad and the lovely romantic relationship between Tim and Mary, without being too sappy, too overly lovey-dovey or too sentimental. The message or overall theme of the film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not too forceful or preachy.The selection of songs for the film was appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenes.The on-screen chemistry between Rachel and Domhnall are convincing enough for the audience to watch them going through life together. On the other hand, Domhnall and Bill, as father and son, their connection is felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories when watching them together.<br/><br/>It's one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer, better than the disappointing 'Time Traveler's Wife'. It's a great date movie that's not to be missed."

","What an amazing movie. When I see the cast and the title, I immediately thought of a romantic clichÃ©, with full of known plot twists, and et cetera. Rachel McAdams is known for her romantic movies, but this was just more and more than that.<br/><br/>About Time was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I was immediately captured, and the cast is so brilliant, I believed every single line. Thank you for this film, I am still under the influence of this movie. It is about life, in the most raw way. How life should be lived, and how we should see the world, as it is.<br/><br/>Extraordinary movie. Magnificent."
"roger-pettit1","10","376","450","28 August 2013"," One of the very best films I have ever seen
","Initial impressions of a book, film, play, piece of music etc. can sometimes be ill-considered. I have occasionally revised my opinion of such a work with the passage of time. I am confident, however, that I shall not change my view on ""About Time"", the sheer brilliance of which has quite bowled me over. It's not only one of the very best films I have seen recently. It's one of the best I have ever seen. Yes, I think it's that good.<br/><br/>""About Time"" is a romantic comedy about the vicissitudes of life and love. It's witty, clever, intelligent and very funny. But it's also a film of perhaps quite surprising depth. The centrepiece of the film is the relationship between Tim (Domnhall Gleeson), a young lawyer living in London, and his father (Bill Nighy), who lives with Tim's mother (Lindsay Duncan) in Cornwall. Tim's father is able to time travel. He cannot change history when doing so; but he can revisit past experiences and incidents within his own life and alter their outcomes. Tim has inherited this ability from his father (a gift which apparently is hereditary on the male side of the family). He uses it to improve his love life. He builds up a strong bond and a young family with Mary (Rachel McAdams). But he soon realises that his exceptional gift does not protect him from the normal ups and downs of family life. Indeed, one of the most moving scenes in the film (and there are many) is a conversation Tim has with his father on learning that the latter has terminal cancer. <br/><br/>The performances, the screenplay, the direction and the soundtrack are first class. The humour is excellent. There is one very funny scene in which Tim nervously meets his prospective in-laws for the first time and blurts out an admission that he and Mary do not practise oral sex. There is also a very amusing sex scene. The soundtrack includes music performed by The Cure, Amy Winehouse and Nick Cave. Indeed, the featured Cave song, ""Into My Arms"", forms a motif for the themes depicted in the film and gets a specific mention by Tim's father when he is discussing his funeral arrangements with Tim. <br/><br/>""About Time"" is a very watchable, intelligent and witty film that could so easily have descended to mawkishness and sentimentality. But it doesn't. It's a brilliant film that raises in the viewer's mind all sorts of important questions about life, love and loyalty. Do go and see it. 10/10."
"beardfaceduncan","10","307","372","28 September 2013"," One of the best films I've seen
","I loved this film. I perfect balance of story, humour and sincerity along with excellent acting and a wonderful cast. Even the soundtrack was superb. Not your average time travel movie. Very thought provoking and one which tugged at the old tear ducts in the best way. Some reviews complain about how it is like this or that film. No film is unique, and for sure there are similarities with other Richard Curtis films, but that is all. Plus to be compared to other great films is surely an honour. Forget about all that and enjoy what is a great film which will inspire you in ways you were not expecting. Thoroughly enjoyable and I'm already looking forward to going to see it again. That doesn't happen very often."
"james-67-118290","10","415","511","9 September 2013"," How can people slate this movie???
","I just don't understand how people are not liking this film. It is just perfect!!! Any Richard Curtis movie I rate against Love actually, because to me that is his best film and one of my all time favourites! But About Time for me beats love actually hands down. The film is so well thought out and the cast is just so good! I have seen this movie twice already as it was such a great story. The main focus of the film is about love and family so don't be too worried about the travelling in time, it fits into the film so well and makes some great comic moments when things go wrong. Don't listen to the haters, this really is a fabulous movie! It is a sad thought though that this could be Richard's last film he is going to direct, I hope not, but if it is, what a way to end his brilliant films! <br/><br/>Well done Richard Curtis! 10/10"
"msims1","10","188","229","9 October 2013"," Chick Flick for Men
","My husband accompanied me, but warned me that he would not stay if it didn't interest him after 15 minutes. He stayed, and gave me the summary, CHICK FLICK FOR MEN.<br/><br/>It's a fantasy because it deals with living in the present and the past at the same time. It's a romance because it's about young love, and love expressed between two people who have been married for a very long time and still feel that spark that brought them together. It's a family film about siblings loving one another so much that one of them might just jeopardize his future to save his sister's life. It's a cautionary tale for those who practice habits that could sicken them or get them killed. It's about life, and truly living one's life even when faced with the prospect of death. <br/><br/>The acting is solid, and Rachel McAdams is lovely and inspiring. The rest of the actors are amazing as well, and you want to believe that it is all real. But the story itself can be so unbelievable. Just go with it. It's like a really high calorie dessert that tastes so good you don't care if you gain five pounds. I enjoyed ABOUT TIME immensely, and I could watch it again and again."
"dtpieper","10","60","70","22 February 2014"," Wish I could travel back in time and watch this movie again for the first time
","I love horror movies. I like fun movies. But I am not really into romantic movies. Except this one. <br/><br/>I think it is well paced and has a lot of heart and warmth, and I swore profoundly when I read the reviews in the Danish media. As I see it, it is not just another ""boy meets girl"" love story. It is first and foremost a story about appreciating life - even the everyday routine. But also a film about the bond between a young man and his father.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say this: The plot is great and the story is well paced; The casting and acting is very good by all the main characters; Bill Nighy is really a joy to watch; The music/sound track is ""spitzenklasse"" throughout; I would not have to think twice if Rachel McAdams were to ask me to have a third child(sic!); The father/son farewell scene brought me the rare sensation of tears in my eyes (thank you for that)"

"cinematic_aficionado","Null","139","176","7 September 2013"," an unexpected delight
","A young man, like many others. Only he can travel in time. This main element of the plot, is something that was difficult to digest throughout the film, since it was not a predominantly sci-fi movie. This struggle was compensated by the successful interjection that even with such ability, life can have difficulties.<br/><br/>The main character, did use this to his advantage to win the love of the girl he was so fond of but still he often faced difficult choices as to let things happen or turn the time back to prevent them.<br/><br/>One thing that makes this stand out is the somewhat philosophical approach, an approach that is conveyed with simplicity so all can relate.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an intelligent film, with emotion and poignancy."
"The_moan_of_all_moans","7","88","111","9 September 2013"," Charming.
","Really surprised by this one;was expecting the run of the mill rom-com, but it is so much more than that; it's about family and the smiles and cries of life. The whole film was filled with charm, wit and had its fair share of heartfelt moments. Time travel is a subject that has been visited many times in the film industry, but this had its own unique touch to it. <br/><br/>The film flows really nicely, it oozes class at some points. And the mere thought of having the ability to travel back in time sends your mind into a whirlwind of what-ifs? The acting is superb by all, but Bill Nighy was my favourite as Tim's Dad. When on screen with Domhnall Gleeson (Tim), the connection is very convincing and it was those scenes that i enjoyed the most.<br/><br/>A very good film and worthy of a viewing by any standards <br/><br/>7.25/10"
"theycallmemrglass","8","110","143","19 August 2013"," Charming, funny and poignant romantic time travelling comedy drama. A top date movie.
","I attended a preview screening of this in London.<br/><br/>If you enjoy previous Richard Curtis (writer, director) films such as Four Weddings and a funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually then you will very likely enjoy this sweet time travel comedy drama albeit with an ironic sense of time travel feeling of been having been here before.<br/><br/>But that more of the same feeling is no bad thing, thanks largely to the wonderful performances of the cast and more importantly, the exquisite execution of its new spin, the time travelling plot device. In fact, the time travelling here is really good fun and plentiful as its employed with typical motives but with inventiveness by our main protagonist, a stereotypical ""loser"" played with utter charm and goofiness by Domhall Gleeson. His use of the power is at times hilarious but very useful without your typical ""changing your past will backfire"" moral message. In most time travel movies, changing events in the past is usually painted as a negative repercussion but here, for the most part, the movie is certainly promoting its benefits. <br/><br/>The time travel premise have some set rules that nicely serves the narrative, although if you think too carefully in some scenes, you might find some minute flaws in the execution of the cause and effects which could have been made neater if extra attention was paid. <br/><br/>There is a moral message but you have to wait until the end to get what it is because it isn't so obvious as the film rolls. You might suspect things will happen in some ways as you watch the film but they don't and you might wonder, what's the story then but let it roll and the point of it all comes at the end. <br/><br/>However, that waiting for the end leads to my first little bit of criticism. This film clocks in at just over 2hours and it did feel a tad too long. There are quite a few points in the film which I feel could have been trimmed. I think it could have been about at least 10 minutes shorter.<br/><br/>There are familiar stalwart faces from Richard Curtis's previous films making guest appearances with the always awesome Bill Nighy justifiably anchoring a supporting role with his usual high calibre presence. Its also nice to see one of our great British character actors who had recently passed away make a surprise and funny bit part appearance perhaps for the last time...or did the film makers travel back in time to shoot his part? Rachel McAdams is very lovely as the love interest and is believable as a girl worth manipulating time for. <br/><br/>I'm not a great fan of Richard Curtis previous movies but this film swims along with so much charm, English middle class idiosyncrasies, a lovely romance and a gentle pacing that flows with a steady beat from beginning to end. This is not a riotous comedy, its not a thriller, nor an adventure or even a film that draws any suspense towards the last act. Its a journey through a period of our time traveller's life, sometimes funny, charming, poignant with a very clever and enjoyable time travelling premise. <br/><br/>Its certainly a great date movie too.<br/><br/>8/10"

It just didn't show some lame romantic or comedy that show in many movies these days. It's a complete masterpiece. It gave the most realistic scene that any movie can show.<br/><br/>Beside the romance I liked the part that showed the relationship between the father and the son.

","So, I don't like romance movies. And it's not because I don't like love stories, it's because I think most romance movies are kinda shallow. Love is a great thing, but, usually, a regular love story, isn't enough for me to enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>I've watched this movie, like, a dozen times. It isn't about the love story nor the time travel stuff. It's because of the small things. This movie makes me cry of happiness. It is AMAZING how it makes me think about the people I care about, the people that cares about me, the small happy moments in my life and many other things that, when I notice, are making a tear come down into my cheek.<br/><br/>This movie changed me. And it keeps changing me every time I rewatch it. It made me notice that life is amazing, even in it's simpliest moments. It showed me how I should enjoy everyday as if it was my final. It made me a happier person. And for that, this movie is my number one.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it too."

","I don't know how we missed this movie, but my husband found it on HBO, and we watched it because we had an open night. First of all, I had no idea it was a Richard Curtis film. I'm such a huge fan of his. I love how he blends comedy, drama, romance, and a really deep philosophical message about life.<br/><br/>And second, I actually think this is my most favorite of his films. The film had me from the opening shot. And I remember thinking as I'm watching the first few minutes, that this is some of the best writing I've ever heard. And the performance by Domhall Gleeson is star-turning. I'm so used to seeing him as a villain in ""Star Wars"" that he completely caught me off guard with his endearing, honest portrayal.<br/><br/>I could go on-and-on. Great story. Great end message.

"just-woot","10","3","3","3 December 2018"," About a love story
","Of course we all (perhaps all...) wish there was a way to go back and change something in our lives. Or another's. This movie touches lightly on the paradox of time travel for the traveler's sake. Consequences. Yes, others have attempted this ... i.e., The Butterfly Effect, et al. About Time adds a sweet spin on the concept. I loved my own father and my own brother dearly, and have lost them both, way too soon, years ago. What I would give to go back and change one thing in their lives that would have perhaps gotten them through that fateful day.<br/><br/>Without the sci fi special effects and explosions and CGI to speak of, this movie takes us back innocently. Yes, there are some selfish reasons portrayed initially (who wouldn't do the same?), but he overcomes that to only want to help or better those around him. Ultimately realizing that each day is a new day, and a chance to ""change"" our future for the better, he gives up the time travel altogether. This is a beautiful movie, and reminiscent of Adam Sandler's ""Click"".<br/><br/>Live your life today, tomorrow, to its fullest. Don't live to regret what has happened and grow old wishing you could change it. Love and hug and kiss those that mean so much to you. Cherish each day and each person you love. Life is fragile. See this endearing movie. 10/10!"

So the main Character's past is at times, located in the future.. So it lets you undo any big mistakes. <br/><br/>I feel like they could have done more with time travel rather than being all romantic. Don't get me wrong I love the romantic side of the movie. But he basically just decides that this woman is going to be his soul mate...It was only the 2nd woman he ever liked. And it was just too easy to woo her which Made me think that he was going to find another love somewhere down the line but I am glad it stayed simple. <br/><br/>Could you imagine how crazy it would be if he had a brother.

I may have been in just the right frame of mind or seen it on the right day but to me this movie was exactly what I needed, and it is indeed soul food. I don't really feel the need to describe the plot the trailer does that well enough and the fact that I think it is a good move can be seen in my rating.<br/><br/>Instead I'll get a bit personal here but that's how much this movie affected me. I just finished the day looking at apartments and different parts of a city with my parents (I'm moving here in the fall for college), and I'll be honest it was a rough long day but then in our hotel room watching this movie the day completely changed as clichÃ©d as that may seem. <br/><br/>This movie touched me to in a way very few movies ever have and few ever will. We all have those special movies that taught us how to be a better person or made use realize something about ourselves we never saw before. About Time is one of my movies I hope it is also one of yours because those movies are why I believe film exists. Beyond the ability to entertain, they share with us a part of what it is to be human.

"kiwonchoi","10","5","6","6 December 2015"," The most touching movie
","'About Time' (2013) is a romantic movie directed by Richard Curtis, who made several famous romantic-comedy movies such as 'Love Actually' in 2003 and 'Notting Hill' in 1999. He also won several awards like 'Christopher Award'. This movie is a romantic comedy, but it is touching and instructive, which is quite different to Richard Curtis's other movies. The plot is tidy and neat, and the soundtrack was really harmonious with the film.<br/><br/>The main character, Tim, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is a normal man born in the countryside of England. When he turns 20, his father (Bill Nighy) tells Tim that his family has the ability to travel through time. However his family had faced difficulty due to this ability because they used it to get fame or money, so he decides to use this ability for love. Therefore, he uses this ability to meet Mary (Rachel McAdams), who will be his wife. They get married and enjoy their life. However, some things go badly so Tim goes back to fix them, but when he tries to save one important thing, he realizes he loses another important one. He should make a choice one and abandon the precious things in life.<br/><br/>This movie is really well-made because it teaches us a lot of lessons and makes us think about the important things in our life. There are no special effects or sets but it makes the movie more realistic. The most outstanding aspect of the film is the wedding of Tim and Mary. In this scene, the camera catches the beautiful scene in the wedding. The couple looks so happy that audience will admire that wedding and the wedding scene also makes us happy. What's more in this scene, the soundtrack makes the atmosphere better. The plot starts with love but it expands to the meaning of life. This skillful movie will make you feel the love of family, farewell form family, and happiness.<br/><br/>'About Time' is the last movie of Richard Curtis who was a master of romantic comedy movies. This movie uses time traveling, so you may know this movie emphasizes the importance of time like other plain movies, but I think there is no other movie as touching and memorable. We know we will die in the future and this movie awake us about the value of our life and time. I recommend you to watch this movie for lessons that cannot be learned easily."

I had never heard of the main character so I didn't know what to expect. However, after seeing this movie, he is now one of my favorite British actors. I'm going to try and keep this short and sweet and get to the point. This movie is unbelievably sweet and charming and unforgettable. It has its quirky moments but they totally make the movie.

The loss of friends and loved ones and learning what you have comes to you in this film. the relationship between the father and son is priceless. Decisions to be made and tests to pass keep the story going and it is so wonderfully told. Some wont see it for its R rating, that's sad in this case as life is a little R rated at times.

So, by now, we know the features of Curtisworld: locations in London, upper middle-class English types, lots of friendship and love, plenty of wry and sometimes rude humour, a socially inhibited boy, an attractive North American girl, a doddery elderly male relative, a freaky young female relative, probably a wedding, probably a funeral, obviously some heavy rain, well-chosen songs, and finally a clever film title. ""About Time, which Curtis has both written and directed, delivers all the familiar ingredients and is a charming addition to the canon but, while I really liked it, it was not love actually.<br/><br/>This time, we have two love stories and a time travel device that enables both to achieve special fulfilment. There is the father-son relationship between Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson and the sexual relationship between Glesson and (Canadian) Rachel McAdmas (coincidentally ""The Time Traveler's Wife""). Both the technique of time travel (clenching hands in a darkened space) and the rules (forget the 'Butterfly Effect') are rather ridiculous, but the device serves to pose some almost philosophical questions: If you could travel back in time to change things in your life, how often would you do it and what would you change? In the end, is it a power that you would use to change the facts of the past or your perception of the present?"
"sachinjain50","9","6","8","15 June 2015"," The best time traveler movie of all times
","Have seen quite a few time travel movies, but this one beats them all on all grounds. The plot, the relevance of the time travel, not overdoing it, the characters soooooo beautifully played by all (even the role of Uncle Desmond - who has such a short role to play in the movie, plays it soooo convincingly and to the best of what the character demands.) The best of all - the dialog's. You will tend to fall in love with them. Humorous, witty and so beautifully written that it makes the movie watching experience an absolute delight. And then the characters who are delivering these dialog's in a manner that I don't think I will like to see or hear in any other form than how it is done in this movie. <br/><br/>Not much of a reviewer on IMDb, just a few one before these, but this was one movie which I just wanted to pen down about, with the hope that whosoever is reading it to figure out whether I should watch this movie or not, can simply go and get that DVD right now without second thoughts. You would have the most amazing 2 hours watching this brilliant movie. Enjoy!"
"TheSquiss","5","54","109","21 August 2013"," Some magical moments undone by an endless trudge that doesn't know when to stop.
","I approached About Time with very low expectations. It hasn't arrived with the same fanfare or same star power as many of writer/director Richard Curtis other blockbusters (Notting Hill and Love Actually for example) and the trailer implied something slightly twee rather than truly uplifting. But sometime during the first fifteen minutes I berated myself severely and settled in to what started out as a very sweet, tender and gently amusing film.<br/><br/>Then it stuttered. And the stuttering continued as we edged towards highs and stumbled into elongated lows where nothing much occurred and nobody seemed quite sure of how to lift it again.<br/><br/>On New Year's Eve, 21-year old Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) listens wide-eyed as his dad (Bill Nighy) imparts some fantastic truth about the men in the Lake family: They can travel back in time. There are rules, of course, but the fact remains Tim's world has opened up in a most remarkable way. Much to his father's dismay, Tim decides the best use of his newfound ability is to finally secure a girlfriend. In a longwinded and occasionally funny manner he courts Mary (Rachel McAdams). Mary is insecure and likes to sleep a lot. And other stuff happens, too. Eventually. And some of it even comes about as a result of time travel. Maybe.<br/><br/>The obvious and immediate comparison with About Time is The Time Traveller's Wife, which starred, um, Rachel McAdams. Unfortunately, though the latter was a weak adaptation of a beautiful book, About Time has the feel of what was left on the cutting room floor after they'd excised the humour and protracted subplot.<br/><br/>Ten years ago Hugh Grant would have been cast as Tim and at times it feels as though Gleeson has been forced into Grant's shoes. It's a pity because he is a fine actor and, when allowed to be the Tim in his own head, does a wonderfully charming and understated job. The screenplay sucks but that's hardly his fault. There's also about the same level of chemistry between Tim & Mary as there was between the tomato and chard on my dinner plate last night.<br/><br/>But when Gleeson and Nighy share the screen About Time sparkles. The relationship between father and son is beautiful, it is tender, it is funny and it is the glue that binds the film. I came away not wishing I had the boy/girl relationship but dreaming that the father/son bond was mine. What a pity Curtis didn't have the courage to turn this romcom on its head and make Tim and Mary secondary to Tim & Dad.<br/><br/>There are moments of pure joy where Curtis is on his very best form: The wedding scene is the finest we've seen screen since James Fleet's best man speech in Four Weddings & a Funeral. It doesn't hang around, it is neither schmaltzy nor patronizing but is magically sweet and funny. The theatre sequence, too, is comedy gold. In a completely different way, the last few scenes with Tim and Dad are tender, sensitive and deeply affecting.<br/><br/>And then Curtis undoes the stitching. Take the dress scene; we've seen it in countless films before where girl tries on dresses but can't make her mind up while boy fails to help the issue. It's no longer original and, in this incarnation, is at least five dresses too long. It's so protracted it hurts. It's a problem that persists throughout About Time. It just doesn't know when to stop. Frequently, it even forgets what it is about and suddenly throws in a time traveling scene to justify its name. Inside this lumpy, tedious 117 minute trudge is an 85 minute gem desperately fighting to escape. Was script editor Emma Freud asleep when she held her red pen? Was editor Mark Day afraid of offending Curtis? Black marks to them both.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is a real boon to About Time. Lyndsay Duncan's Mum is just the right side of eccentric while Uncle D (Richard Cordery) is as mad as a box of frogs and delightfully so. Chief amongst them is Harry (Tom Hollander), the self-centered, embittered playwright who takes any glimmer of joy, crumbles it, insults it and stamps on it for good measure. He is used sparingly to crisp the edges of scenes that edge towards tedium. What a pity he wasn't let loose with a flamethrower throughout.<br/><br/>But even with the minor characters and their subplots, Curtis struggles as if he has a checklist of occurrences he absolutely must insert to appeal to everyone and so he throws in a broken sister with alcohol and domestic issues, parental issues with overbearing visiting folks <br/><br/>About Time is too much, too long, too over-egged, and too reliant on previous films. Watching About Time is like swimming through porridge to the occasional pockets of beautifully sweet honey and then struggling onwards in vain the hope of another.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","An ordinary 21 year old man is shocked to discover that he has the ability to travel through time, a concept which, granted, is not new to the world of cinema. Although this unusual ability is naturally the main theme of the film, the plot still engages the viewer with the struggles of every day life including marriage, finding a job, having children as well as a few family issues to keep the plot fresh. The intriguing plot complements the few time-travelling excursions and keeps the idea crisp.<br/><br/>The plot is thought provoking and the script is kept light, with several laugh-out-loud moments which can be all-too rare in this genre.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson gives an extremely high quality performance in his lead role and is supported well by the highly experienced rom-com lead Rachel McAdams and an ever-amusing Bill Nighy, who provides much of the comic relief in the film.<br/><br/>The plot could perhaps be accused of moving slowly at times; however this only serves to heighten the drama of the intriguing plot twists."
"studioAT","10","7","10","3 November 2016"," An excellent film
","'About Time' gets a lot of flack from people who spot the plot holes, or who are biased against Richard Curtis films before they even watch them. For me though this is his best work.<br/><br/>It's got everything. The first half is classic Curtis Rom-com. We've got the bumbling Brits, the American girl he hopelessly chases, there's supporting characters we fall in love with. It's all fun and lovely.<br/><br/>But then along comes the second half that absolutely breaks your heart because the scenes between Nighy and Gleeson are so poignant. For a film to have this much warmth and heart is a rare thing.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film highly enough."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","8","12","3 October 2013"," Slices of life
","When Richard Curtis turns to sci-fi as a vehicle for his acclaimed human stories, the results is mixed. As sci-fi ""About time"" is an absolute disaster. As Curtis's signature thoughtful, gentle and often humorous exploration of human feelings, it is delightful.<br/><br/>I'm not going to waste time on a discourse of time traveling. One does not need to be an Isaac Asimov devotee to understand the most fundamental paradox: what happens when you meet yourself in the past. As well, a key theme addressed in the proliferation of time-traveling movie is whether you can change things in the past so that you switch yourself into a difference life line. Suffices to say that Curtis is not even remotely concerned with these questions, but simply uses this loose idea of ""time traveling"" to suit whatever he wants to do in his movie, bending it whichever way his whims or the need of the movie steers. I can't even say there are logical plot holes because in this movie, insofar as the science of time travel is concerned, there is no logic, none, whatsoever, period.<br/><br/>As Curtis has demonstrated times and again, depth does not necessarily require gravity (nothing to do with the recent movie with that title). A vast majority of we mortals live a life that cannot be even remotely associated with the word ""epic"", with any stretch of imagination. Indeed we face life, death, partings, illness, joys and woes, but none as dramatic as what you would see depicted on the silver screen. What Curtis does best is touching the everyday audience with everyday slices of life: romance, parental siblings love, parenthood, friendship.all quite ordinary and as such, empathy-winning.<br/><br/>Told by VO of the protagonist, everything in this story revolves around the young man from the idyllic Cornwall coast who articles in London to be a lawyer, then becoming one. Domhnall Gleeson, intelligent but unassuming, is instantly lovable as he projects his easy humor, to both the people around him in the movie and the audience. No matter how many times I see the first appearance in any movie of Rachel McAdmas, it always comes with a ""wow"", especially this one, and you have to watch it to see why. The romance, as said, is slices-of-life light, but by no means lacking in depth. Bill Nighy elicits another sort of ""wow"" and in this movie, as the father, he makes our protagonist the envy of every son. Tom Hollander always lifts a movie a notch, whether it is good or bad (and this one is definitely good, plot disaster notwithstanding). Playing a family friend and an eccentric playwright, he is not unlike one of the caricature portraits in a Dickens novel. Lydia Wilson is a joy to watch, as the protagonist's sister with a tell-tale name of ""Kit Kat"". There are others too, in a large support cast, making solid contributions.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, after lots of laughs and many heart-warming moments, the audience emerges with an endearing though: treasure every day you life. <br/><br/>Sci-fi? Forget it!"
"kevin-n-reno","10","14","24","11 April 2014"," A true masterpiece.
","I went into this movie expecting a cute romance, with a touch of comedy, and a bit of ""Back to the Future"" style Sci-fi flair. What I received was a beautiful and massively moving story about love. Not just romantic love (although there is plenty of that also,) but also the love between siblings, parents, friends, and even strangers. Warning: This movie will make you cry, but the end of this film will redeem any tears with an unshakable message about appreciating day to day life, and how to appreciate the beauty we experience each day. I was especially glad that this film dodges several old and annoying movie clichés that I expected to see as the film progressed. In closing, this film has an original storyline, very talented actors, and a genuinely moving power."
"briancseel","8","10","16","16 February 2014"," Ignore the Marketing, Wonderful Film
","This movie is a great example of how unique films can get buried under the bad marketing of the Hollywood machine. If you know anything about this film prior to watching it chances are you think A)it is about time travel and B)it is a comedy.<br/><br/>Time travel is a part of the storyline, but this is NOT a time travel movie. Hence the disappointment and angry reviews from the sci-fi geeks who apparently felt the world needed yet another movie riffing on changes to the space-time continuum and the butterfly effect.<br/><br/>Because this is a British film, it gives you a few laughs, the British never take any subject completely seriously.<br/><br/>Since what the film actually is defies the conventions of 2 minute trailers and :30 TV commercials Hollywood hung its hat on the two things above.<br/><br/>What the film really is about, as the title says, is ""About Time"". It is a father-son story in the vein of ""Cat's in the Cradle"". The story makes many salient points about life, specifically because it isn't bogged down with explaining in detail how the time travel (which we all know is impossibly anyway so what's the obsession with the explanation sci-fi geeks?) works.<br/><br/>It is, what intelligent people would call a ""plot device"". A way to make points about love, loss, and life. The men are the only ones who can travel back to make this a father-son story and keep it focused. The screenwriter made choices as to what he wanted his story to be people, that is a good thing.<br/><br/>The cast is all capable but they are not depended on to carry the story at any point so no performance really stands out. If there is any flaw in the movie it is the lack of high drama at any point, but the overall message of the film, brought home at the end, makes up for it.<br/><br/>A very good film, the kind Hollywood makes too few of. Probably because when the pitch comes across their desk they sum it up as, ""time travel romantic comedy""."
"lasttimeisaw","6","18","33","30 October 2014"," a crowd-pleaser but the time travel setting backfires
","ABOUT TIME is one half snappy romance and another half family drama which lures us into the tutelage of some very beneficial ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" truisms like ""value your life and live everyday fully"", ""notice the beauty in the small things around you"" and ""be brave to say goodbye to the beloved and move on"", such and such. And under the sine qua non of a time-travel set-up. <br/><br/>At the age of 21, Tim (Gleeson in his breakthrough leading man offer), a clumsy young Brit learns from his father (Nighy) that all men in his family can travel in time (with certain limitation for sure). So with this windfall fate-altering gift, Tim starts to woo Mary, the girl of his dream, and eventually they get married and babies are coming on the way. <br/><br/>On the face value, the film is tremendously entertaining and heart-warming, Tim's naturalistic maladroitness proffers enough ballast for repeating his one-trick pony to finally win Mary over, along the way there are laughters galore; the family bond is also capaciously constructed between Tim and his father, and a detour to save his sister Kit Kat (Wilson) from wrong choices in her life. <br/><br/>The biggest revelation of the time-travel theory comes after Tim has fixed Kit Kat's past by going back to the time-line before the conception of Tim and Mary's first baby, when he jumps back, the process has altered the baby's gender. Then immediately after that scene Tim manages to miraculously change everything back to normal, so clearly this ""no pre- baby travel"" rule can be amended afterward. Which drastically conflicts with the eventual dilemma of choosing between going back to visit his deceased father and having a baby no. 3 after his dad's death, for the reason that he can reverse the repercussion of the butterfly effects whatsoever (as he did in the case of Kit Kat). <br/><br/>I'm not nitpicking (as I am more than happier to overlook the technicality of time-travel experience, take one example, how come Kit Kat gets a hunch that she is in love with Jay after they went back to the past and altered their fate, while Tim is oblivious of his newborn baby's gender until he sees him with his own eyes?), but the film is deeply flawed in a logic stand-point and this plot-hole is too glaring to overlook, which does hurt the movie's empathy in its final stage. Alas, the performances are generally favorable, Nighy surges into my Supporting Actor chart as a benevolent father figure, immensely understanding and reasonable, passes on his wisdom (which accumulated through ages) with coherent delivery, and as the sole theory elucidator, he is the one attracts the most amount of interest on screen (although he should have warned his son about the rule beforehand, which would save the film from its paradoxical miasma).<br/><br/>Gleeson and McAdams makes a fitting couple, although for the latter, it is her third time being the girl of a time-traveler (after Eric Bana and Owen Wilson), her American sweetheart default and clever dressing choice remarkably masks the age difference, while a baby-face Gleeson doesn't truly reflect the passing years in the narrative. There are also several interesting secondary players, the sexy bomb Margot Robbie appears as Tim's unrequited love interest, Lindsay Duncan sheds a light of coolness as Tim's unwitting mother, and Tom Hollander is the swearing playwright with a cynical bad temper. ABOUT TIME is Oscar- nominated writer Richard Curtis' third venture (the man who writes MR. BEAN series, BRIDGET JONES series, NOTTING HILL 1999, and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 1994, 7/10) as a director (after LOVE ACTUALLY 2003, 7/10 and PIRATE RADIO 2009), no wonder it is such a successful crowd-pleaser and even a tearjerker, only if its content could have made more sense out of the infinite loop impedes the time travel sub-genre."

"blakeholcomb-77766","9","4","5","15 January 2019"," Movies never make me cry...this one did
","I'm vaguely familiar with Richard Curtis and his works. I've seen 4 Weddings, and part of Notting Hill. I am by no means an avid consumer of anything Curtis. I saw this one because an ex-girlfriend from 25 years ago looked me up on social media to tell me that she had found my movie doppelgänger in Domhnall Gleeson's character in this flick called ""About Time"". So, I had to check it out.<br/><br/>To be frank, I am no where near as charming or clever or cute as Tim. She was wrong on that front. But I'm so glad her message found me because this movie is amazing.<br/><br/>Is it sentimental, sappy, romantic? Yes to all 3 and, therefore, not my normal cinematic fare. The time travel aspect being thrown into a rom-com story almost discouraged me from even giving it a chance. But I had to see this British movie character version of myself.<br/><br/>My relationship with my father, or lack thereof, made this movie very personal and difficult to watch for me. You see, that's really the central, most powerful key to the plot. Yes it's a love story and it's silly and whimsical and all that. But Tim and his father have the relationship that I strive every day to have with my son, now 16, because it's the missing thing in my life that left this giant vacancy in my soul. And my life now largely revolves around ensuring that my son never experiences that vacancy.<br/><br/>I know this sounds more like an autobiography than a movie review. So I'll sum it up this way. Don't let the preposterous nature of the plot scare you away. The time travel scenarios, though silly and highly unscientific, are crucial to the plot development. If you are a son with a son(s) of his own, this movie is for you. Anyone who says this is a chick flick missed the point and got it completely wrong. This is a guy flick for guys who aren't afraid of their own souls and the emotions that come from them. I've watched it 3 times now and each time I cry a little less and smile a little more."

","Absolutely brilliant. Touching and comedic when it needed to be. The acting was on point (as you might expect from a Peter Curtis movie). The characters where charming and easy to relate to and they quickly made me very emotionally attached to this masterpiece. I absolutely adored John Bodens take on ""How long will I love you"" (originally sang by Ellie Goulding I believe), it really fit in well with the movie as did the other music. Another thing I really liked about this film was how quickly it got to the point and didn't linger at the beginning, almost immediately you learn about Tims ability, soon after it then leads you promptly into the main body of the movie. The ending was satisfying to say the least and it really left me feeling great and as though I had been on a journey. All in all I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a feel good Romantic comedy."
"nashuadoll-208-752903","9","4","5","9 January 2015"," About Time
","I feel that movie-goers have begun to lose sight of what movies truly are. Movies were created to not only entertain, but to try to invoke some sort of emotion. Joy, sorrow, anger, etc. If a movie accomplishes something of the sort with a large portion of the audience, they have succeeded. Nowadays, it seems that all movies are being put through the Academy Awards lens. Not all movies are being released with the intention to win awards. And, while I know many people will disagree with the point I am trying to make about films, I think a film deserves praise if it sufficiently invokes emotion. <br/><br/>About Time is one of those movies.<br/><br/>I need to preface this by saying that the made up genre name of ""Chick Flick"" is completely ridiculous. Now with that in mind, I went into this movie having been told that it was indeed a ""Chick Flick."" Now I realize that many movies that are described using this phrase are not all that stellar. My expectations were low to say the very least. The surprise that I received was extremely welcome.<br/><br/>From the beginning with the initial narration from Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) I knew this was going to be a different movie. Maybe it was knowledge that this film was filled with actors and actresses from the United Kingdom, but I immediately had a good feeling. That is how movies should make us feel.<br/><br/>It would be easy to pick out what all the film did right. For instance, the characters were believable and the cast interacted perfectly on screen. I regained a little respect for the quick wit of sharp dialogue delivery of Rachel McAdams that had been lost after her performance in Mean Girls. Bill Nighy solidified why he is one of my favorite British actors. The story itself was believable even though it tackled the immensely tricky issue of time travel. There was indeed tension where there needed to be tension, humor where there needed to be humor, and then a serious punch to the gut where a serious punch was necessary. Overall, the film was pieced together brilliantly.<br/><br/>To me though, it wasn't the film itself that makes me give it the high praise. It wasn't really even the message. To me, it was the development of characters and relationships that makes this movie phenomenal. One of the crucial points in most every movie is whether or not the characters portrayed can interact with one another in a way that is entertaining and believable. This movie hinges on it's relationships working and it succeeds brilliantly. He begins the narration at the beginning by talking about his family and his opinion of each of them. It draws us in and soon we can hardly look away. Yes, there is also the romance that makes this film a ""Chick Flick"", but it is tackled in a completely fresh and new way. However, it also touched on the issue of negative relationships with Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) and Jimmy Kincade (Tom Hughes). But instead of the movie beating us over the head with the awfulness of said relationship, it is fairly subtle and we see Kit Kat come to the much needed realization on her own. Therein we see another powerful relationship that strikes close to home for me: a brother sister relationship. Right from the beginning when Tim says that Kit Kat is one of the most beautiful people he has ever known, I loved him. The development of their relationship as they both age in the film was masterfully done and a real thrill to watch.<br/><br/>Above all, the relationship that drove this movie home for me was the one between Tim and his dad. Anybody who has ever had any feelings towards their father, whether it be complete love and admiration of utter hatred and disgust, could feel the power of their bond. The understanding looks that his father gives, the humorous tidbits he adds into his talks, and his general care-free way of life make him a perfectly flawed human being. He is exactly what so many kids want from a dad. About Time captured this relationship in the most perfect way possible and I could not look away.<br/><br/>This movie was fantastic. You will laugh. You will cry. You will think deeply about your life in comparison to the one's on screen. I applaud the creator's behind this movie. Keep up the good work and I will continue to appreciate the fantastic outcome."
"rick-haft","2","59","134","13 November 2013"," Great potential. Zero Story line.
","The sad thing was that this film started off really well. I was enjoying it. In the moment and . absolutely Nothing happened. It seemed to be a story about a character who used his time changing powers to change silly insignificant things ( like how good he is in bed) and so much of the plot is wasted with those things that there is very little real story. About two thirds of the way through there is finally some action when the protagonists sister is involved in a car accident but again this really does little to further the plot point. I personally believe this story would be better suited to have been a romance. Marrying the happy couple off right away was a mistake in the plot and leaves little room for adventure. This is just one of those films that has so much potential but misuses it. Not a patch on Love Actually or Notting Hill 2 stars from this user"
"nlytnd_1","8","9","15","6 September 2014"," Entertaining movie, Good premise! A host of corny/cliche' moments. Excellent secondary characters.
","Upon watching this movie I wanted to dock the s__t out of it for it's corny/cliche moments, so much so that It tricked me into disliking this movie when in fact I was thoroughly entertained.The whole going back in time premise is a fun one for me, especially in this context where the central character has the ability to do so and it's just their secret. I would be cool with this being a genre type premise, which there have been a handful of movies along these lines and I typically enjoy them. This time they did it was a romance theme, so I guess corny and cliche' goes with the territory. 
It has an overabundance of awesome secondary characters as in everyone of them. Which kinda gives me reason to believe that this was entirely/originally a well written story, as in limited cliche' moments that got altered a bit in order to get the approval to be made. Probably went something like this; we're going to need a big name, or up in comer actress for Tim's love interest. So they bring in Rachel McAdams, who is, don't get me wrong a great actress, but holy s__t she doesn't belong in this movie. In conjunction with that the studio likely meddled with the more central story of Tim and Mary, clicheing it up for mass production, thus leaving it surrounded by a record breaking level of awesome secondary characters.The dad, Harry, uncle, Tim's two friends, Mary's friend. I really enjoyed the scene with Tim's uncle, where he tells him that the best day of his life was when Tim's dad said that he loved him at the wedding, so the news of his dad having cancer is probably the worst. It was the manor of the uncle that was portrayed throughout that puts that moment into context. Tim is kind of a mixed bag for me. The guy did a good job as an actor, it was the writing for his character which gave me mixed feelings as to whether or not I liked the guy. He kind of comes across as a bit pompous.<br/><br/>On a deeply philosophical note, just be sure to live each day as though it's your last...I can't believe they left us of on such a mundane note. I feel like an abandoned orphan after that. 
Oh we'll, had enough good points to be worth the watch."

There are some plot holes but if you get lost in the ""Science"" of this film...well then you'll miss the heart and art of it. It's a film about family. Each character is flawed and real. As the film went on I cared more and more about each of the characters who became people I felt like I knew. This is an emotional journey to say the least and while I rarely cry when watching films, this one got me. A few times. Happy and sad tears. Life tears I guess you could say."

","This film is funny, moving and genuinely beautiful. It is Richard Curtis at his best, being witty, unabashedly sentimental and altogether English. The England he depicts is rather more beautiful and idiosyncratic and eccentric and charming than anything resembling the real England, but I find it hard to be upset with this depiction when it makes you long to live there, too.<br/><br/>However; fair warning. I rarely cry at films, and it's rarer still that I write a review, but I felt that I must for this film so as to share this disclaimer; you will, at best, cry during this film. At worst, you will be ugly sobbing for forty five minutes throughout the entire latter third. I cried so much my entire face was wet; even my forehead, although that should have been impossible.<br/><br/>That said, I do highly recommend this film."

","I'm very surprised to read so many good reviews about this movie, which just reminds me of the beauty of difference of opinion. Nevertheless, I found this movie absolutely boring. Really, very boring indeed. It's just a story of an not interesting every day life with a supposedly deep meaning. I'm sorry, but The Dead Poet Society delivered that same message way better for me. I had no trouble staying awake during that one.<br/><br/>I don't remember in recent times ever been so aware of the time passing, because the movie just kept on dragging, and dragging. It felt like a 5 hour movie with nothing memorable. Rachel McAdams is so underused, but then again, the story is rather bland. I see that many people enjoyed the dialogs. I did not find them charming, witty or interesting. I really thought I was going to see a comedy and what I got was a total waste of time."

","Pleasant romantic comedy about a young man (Domhnall Gleeson) who is told by his father (Bill Nighy) on his 21st birthday that all the men in his family possess the ability to travel back in time. He proceeds to use this new gift repeatedly to help him fix mistakes in his life and to help him with his relationship with a pretty girl (Rachel McAdams). As a romantic comedy with some tearjerker moments, it's very enjoyable and nice. As science fiction, it will give you headaches with all the plot holes. So the more unforgiving sci-fi fans out there might want to skip this one. I didn't mind it much at first but it got more complicated as it went along. The plot itself is reminiscent of Groundhog Day and maybe a little bit of Somewhere in Time. Gleeson and McAdams both do very well and have great chemistry. McAdams is especially likable. Gleeson has an appealing ""young Hugh Grant"" quality about him. Bill Nighy steals the show from everybody, as is often the case. It's a good movie if you don't think too hard about it. But I must stress if you are someone who is a stickler for flaws in plots or someone who nitpicks time travel stories, you will really hate this. Everybody who doesn't fit that description should definitely check it out."
"zkonedog","8","2","2","9 June 2019"," A Simple Film That Touches On Many Emotional Themes
","Despite being a huge fan of time-travel films, I let this one languish in my proverbial ""unwatched pile"" for quite some time. It looked a bit Nicholas Sparks-ian for me, if you catch my drift. Upon a recommendation, however, I finally decided to give it a try. While not necessarily a perfect film, it was a very enjoyable one that ran the gamut of my emotions the entire way.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who shortly after his 21st birthday is told by his Dad (Bill Nighy) that all the men in the family have a special skill: the ability to travel backwards in time. Initially skeptical, Tim soon discovers this to be the truth. After a serendipitous encounter with Mary (Rachel McAdams), who later becomes his wife and mother of his children, Tim lives his life using that time travel power both for good and for ill.<br/><br/>So many time-travel films get caught up by either trying to explain the ins and outs of the process (a fool's errand), or having the entire movie centered upon that one point. In ""About Time"", a different approach is taken, and one that comes off as refreshing. See, ""About Time"" really isn't a ""time travel movie"" at all. It is a pretty traditional love story, in all honest, only using the ""hook"" of time travel to build its basic structure.<br/><br/>That is truly where the strength of the picture lies: the simple character moments that all good romance films possess. The chemistry between Gleeson and McAdams is special, and just the entire universe they are living in is very relatable. These are character types and situations that almost anyone can relate to, with of course that pesky little time travel detail cropping up and either all the right or wrong times.<br/><br/>My only complaint about this movie? I believe that slightly better direction might have produced a bit more coherent of an ending. Though I saw exactly what it was going for in terms of theme, it feels very abrupt and not necessarily ""earned"". Not bad, just more a sense of ""I wish these specific themes would have been touched on more throughout the film"".<br/><br/>Overall, though, perhaps the greatest compliment I can give ""About Time"" is how many different audiences it could appeal too. Adolescents or the elderly, men or women, film novices or seasoned cinephiles, there are so many potential audiences for the movie because it touches on so many different themes. In the end, it is a wonderfully unique combination of science fiction, romance, and human drama."

","About time is exactly the role I'd expect Rachel McAdams to take up. The plot is interesting, it allows for funny, interesting, and complex situations. The setting is nice and very casual. The cinematography is very artsy and it fits well with the acting and general pacing of the film. I would call About Time a sweet romance. The concept of time travel in a romance seems at a glance as if it would diminish the intimacy and humor of such a beautiful genre of movies. Time Travel in this situation is used to create a romance like other romances but it doesn't feel like ""just another rom-com"" it feels new. The concept is also simple and easy for anyone to grasp with ease. The only movie I've seen Bill Nighy really fit in."

"ikizdevran-882-254684","9","2","2","1 July 2018"," What if every moment in life came with a second chance?
","Time Travel has always been an intriguing idea in cinema and literature. It was born out of human imagination no doubt and has been developed ever since. We used to see the idea of time travel mostly in sci-fi films but in ""About Time"", it is exclusively used as a side tool to reach happiness and to find love. ""About Time"" is a drama flavored romantic comedy that manages to put itself in a different place from the other films of the same genre because of its unique idea and 123 minutes of runtime. The film is using time travel to show us that we don't need time travel to live our lives to the limits. The main point of the film is not to travel in time but to teach us to live and enjoy our lives like it is our last day. We are very much used to this concept of love and happiness in Richard Curtis films. ""About Time"" is both written and directed by him. He made his directing debut with the highly recommended film ""Love Actually"" and with this film he has given clues about his directing and writing style and the ideas that are interesting to him. Up until this day, with his films -as a screenwriter or writer- like ""Bridge Jones' Diary"" or ""Nothing Hill"", he hasn't failed to follow this path. He was also nominated for Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".<br/><br/>""About Time"" tells the story of a boy at the age of 21 who discovers that, men in his family can travel in time. He takes this power and goes out to find a girlfriend and to seek for peace and happiness. Eventually, he manages to have everything he has ever dreamed of without using time travel. So, as I have mentioned above, the idea of the film is the possibility of happiness without time travel. The film is so much focused on delivering this message that it ignores the other critical facts. For example, time travel is possible under very certain rules and breaking those rules means breaking the story and its logical flow. For example, one may ask why only men get to time travel. It has nothing to do with sexual inequality but for the sake of the story's logical flow. Because if the women in the family could have traveled in time, the story would have failed completely. To keep it focused in the present day, you can't travel back in time before you were born. The components of making time travel possible are not very well thought and these bring the credibility of the film down. However, ""About Time"" is a romantic comedy and a feel-good film. Don't be too concerned about the logic of time travel because as I have mentioned before, this film is not about time travel but to show you how, even time travel is unnecessary to be happy. The director makes sure you get the message loud and clear by repeating it over and over which explains the length of the film.<br/><br/>""About Time"" is character based. The chemistry between Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mary (Rachel McAdams) is so live and beautiful that you just want to get involved in their story. The same thing applies for the conversations between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy) as well. This kind of acting is what Richard Curtis heavily depends on to transmit his message to the audience. In this point of view his casting is successful. ""About Time"" is a two-part film. First part is funny and romantic, second part is dramatic and more serious. This is also another characteristic of the film that separates it from the others.<br/><br/>If we had a chance to go back and correct a mistake we have made, we would be living our lives in a completely different way. Having only one shot in most of the cases doesn't allow us to live our lives to the limits. This is a psychological fact and it is indirectly shared in the film under the transformation of Tim from an insecure boy to a confident problem solver. With its rich soundtracks from ""The Cure"" to ""Amy Winehouse"", I have enjoyed ""About Time"". It is going to make you feel good and recharged. Ask yourself the question of time travel. If you had such power what would you use it for? The answer you are going to give will reveal what you desire the most in your life. Time travel is an illusion and when you think about it, you don't need it because you have been there before. Just value each moment of your life and live it to its limits. This is one lesson ""About Time"" is going to teach you."
"siderite","9","2","2","16 May 2014"," The title says it all, but it's about happiness and love, too
","It is very difficult not to like a starring Bill Nighy, even the crappy ones get an extra star at least just for featuring him, but About Time is also written by Richard Curtis, of Love Actually fame, so there is only a tiny tiny chance the movie would not be good. And then Rachel McAdams plays in it, too, making it an instant hit. So like other reviewers here, I don't understand people implying they didn't like the movie (I've just scientifically demonstrated that is impossible).<br/><br/>Time travel films are usually about two things: alternate history and second chances. Alternate history is just a plot device for telling a science fiction story in a familiar environment, while second chances films almost always talk about fixing past mistakes, avoiding regret, enjoying life. This makes About Time more amazing, because it is actually almost devoid of the quasi-religious platitudes relating to regret, guilt and consequences. It is about enjoying life, it is about enjoying your friends and your family, if you are lucky enough to have enjoyable ones, like the dude in the film. It is about enjoying Rachel McAdams, too, but that shouldn't be too difficult.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a bit long at two hours and also having little to do with exploring the awesome power of time travel. However it is a very pleasant romance and family movie, with good solid humour, but without trying to be a comedy, and it is not one of those horrid Christmas ghost things, either. Luckily for us, the lead character was a very nice guy, as was his father, and he didn't consider living his life, then taking it from the start all over again, with other people, other children, other hours of watching... I recommend it."

This is a great movie to watch and watch again. It's funny and heart-warming. I just love the way an absurd concept like time traveling and the way this power is used by the main character tells you so much more than the story on the surface.

","If you could rewind time and go back to correct your mistakes, making everything perfect next time around, would you? This is the basic conceit behind the latest British love story/comedy from ""Love Actually"" & ""Notting Hill"" director Richard Curtis. With that pedigree, most audiences will know what to expect, although the high end ""nobody actually works"" has been toned down somewhat.<br/><br/>At the age of 21 ""Tim"" (Domhnall Gleeson), rather socially inept and certainly challenged in the girlfriend stakes, learns he has an inheritance. Instead of losing his father (Bill Nighy) and gaining a crusty old painting, he gets to keep the old man and know the secret only the male line possess, the ability to time travel.<br/><br/>Following the usual stages of disbelief and hiding in wardrobes, he eventually lands at acceptance. Rather than money, he utilises this new tool for love, by trying to woo the girl of his dreams ""Mary"" (Rachel McAdams). The trick is used sparingly to start but over time becomes a regular feature of his life.<br/><br/>The film is peppered with the usual Curtis trademarks, good music, great cast, offbeat locations and a slight story but benefits from gentle performances from a quality cast.<br/><br/>There are touching moments, especially for those perhaps deeper into their own life arc and no film with Bill Nighy in the cast list can ever be totally dismissed.<br/><br/>Domnhall and McAdams do good work, initial misgivings about the chemistry between the leads, gives way to something wholly believable as the pair grow into the roles together. Lindsay Duncan as long suffering mother and Tom Hollander as ""Harry"" both get a nod for fulfilling support duties well.<br/><br/>The film is arguably longer than it needs to be, there is one later storyline that might easily have been excised to prevent the film overstaying it's welcome.<br/><br/>A perfect date night movie, with precious little to offend and should leave a smile on the face and maybe just a thought or two about seizing and enjoying every moment. Not deep stuff perhaps but arguably none the worse for a film aiming at pleasant and hitting the target.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Enjoyable, light, undemanding yet wholly enjoyable entertainment with a warm heart stitched firmly to the sleeve, perhaps eking a sneaky tear for those in the mood.<br/><br/>Not a Curtis classic perhaps but likely to improve your evening and if not, like ""Tim"" you can rewind and try again until your mood is just right."
"freemantle_uk","7","2","2","10 February 2014"," Both comic and dramatic
","Richard Curtis is known as one of the greats of British comedy and rom-coms, creating characters like Blackadder and Mr Bean and writing and directing Love Actually. Curtis has announced he is planning retire from directing and he takes a more serious turn with his 'last' film, About Time.<br/><br/>Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) is a 21-year-old Cornish man who is unlucky in love and lives his dad (Bill Nighy), Mom (Lindsay Duncan), kooky sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) and Uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery), the least intelligent man you will ever meet. After a disastrous New Year's Eve party Tim's father tells his son all the male in the family can travel back in time, all they need to do is go into a dark spot, concentrate and then they can go back to any point of his life. When Tim finds out about his powers he moves to London to start his career as a barrister and find a girlfriend. He finds his soul-mate in the form of Mary (Rachel McAdams) and he does everything he can to win her over.<br/><br/>Despite About Time's billing as a romantic-comedy it's really a drama that has some comedy in it. The comedy for the most part is gentle in nature, revolving about some witty line, awkward moments and character interactions. Gleeson does let out his inner Hugh Grant, as he's awkward and easily flustered before being able to go back in time to rewrite his mistakes. Much of the humour comes from the time traveling antics that Gleeson.<br/><br/>About Time does have a fine cast supporting cast, but they're used to various success. Tom Hollander was the best as a highly aggressive, easily angered playwright who was the most fouled mouth of all the characters. Nighy is his professional self, as a more restrained character, while still having some decent lines. But Wilson's character can easily be defined as kooky or quirky and the character of Uncle Desmond is a one joke character that he is not particularly smart and he could have been cut out of the film.<br/><br/>At times About Time did seem like it was going to have a theme about fate and destiny and that some actions are pre-determined, no matter what is altered. A case in point is when Tim keeps meeting with his old crash played Margot Robbie. But all of that is undercut, particularly when Tim can manipulate events and when he is having to court Mary over and over again, coming across as the time-traveling stalker.<br/><br/>Curtis has had a great career as a writer but as a director, he sometimes lacks restraint with About Time, a film that ends up being too long and overly sentimental. Curtis wanted to emotionally manipulate the audience into his way of thinking as he lays on his message of living life to the full, particularly in the final act.<br/><br/>About Time does struggle to find a narrative as it starts out to be rom-com with a sci-fi twist, before turning into a romance and finally being a story about Tim with his dad. There are twist and subplots on the way, with some clever concepts and unique looks on time travel: but a good 20 to 30 minutes could have been cut as the end just drags and drags.<br/><br/>About Time is a solid effort from Curtis as it has a top cast with Gleeson and McAdams having strong chemistry together, which is what we want and expect from a romantic film. The film does offer some laughs and a tranquil piano heavy score from Nick Laird-Clowes with some decent pop music in the soundtrack. But this is a film that is just too long and where many of the ideas could have effectively been done in a few short films.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

"Robert_duder","9","2","2","1 February 2014"," A unique and beautiful story about life. Simply magical!
","I thought the trailers for this film looked pretty good. The cast was good, the concept seemed great and I thought it looked like a very unique indie love story. I was right but I also understated it in my mind. This film was brilliant. Magical. Sweet. Touching and emotional. I loved every minute of it. I laughed and cried and just have been thinking about the film ever since...a surefire sign of a great movie. It is deep and important and has such a beautiful message about life and love. Some harsher reviewers call it unrealistic and a close minded vision of the world and perhaps it is a little neat and tidy but some people live neat and tidy lives and it doesn't do anything to take away from the fact that nearly anyone can find a message here to apply to their own life. It is about seeing the beauty around you. Its the fact that this man can essentially change anything in his life but learns that true beauty is the way the world unfolds as it is. It gives me chills just writing that. This very well may have and should have made my best of 2013 list and I liked it enough that I just may amend my already posted list because this truly moved me.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is just about perfect as the bumbling, adorable everyman Tim. He is just someone you can relate to. He feels real. He isn't a chiseled, square jawed Hollywood superstar and he gives this truly moving, intense, emotional performance that feels right. It isn't an in your face obvious performance but a subtle role that grows on you. The amazing Rachel McAdams is the love of his life and they are stunning together. McAdams seems to have this chemistry with the men in her films (most of them) that is compelling and riveting and passionate. McAdams and Gleeson on the surface may seem like an odd couple and yet that are a match made in heaven to watch. Like Gleeson's performance McAdams and their relationship feels genuine and real. It is a little fairy tale-esque but so what. We all need a little fairy tale romance in our lives. Bill Nighy is brilliant...'nuff said. Honestly, this guy is just charismatic and stunning and you immediately connect with him and fall in love with him as Tim's doting father. Is he the personification of the perfect father? Yes. Again...so what. We don't watch films for reality. I suspected and knew that death would play a part in Nighy's character and there were scenes prior to that where I was almost crying thinking about Tim losing him. He is enigmatic in this role. Lydia Wilson is good as Tim's beloved and extremely quirky sister. Its sort of an odd role that doesn't quite fit in the film and yet she doesn't quite fit in her family so it makes some sort of sense in the grand scheme of things. She still adds a level of fun to the cast and she's good. Lindsay Duncan, Richard Cordery and Joshua McGuire are decent in very small supporting roles.<br/><br/>I am genuinely shocked that director Richard Curtis has so few credits to his name as director. That being said Love Actually is considered a modern day Holiday classic (I have yet to see it) and Pirate Radio is also considered great by some. He is a terrific writer having penned some truly outstanding work but he clearly has a handle on his own screenplay here. The cinematography behind this love story is lovely in its own right. The British scenery is serene and beautiful. The film is quirky and funny and awkward and then beautiful and emotional and just deep if you really inspect it. There were so few errors in the film though I think you'll find, as I did, that you'll be asking yourself a few key questions like why he and his father never tell anyone...especially the women they adore so much. The addition of transporting another person in time was rather unexplained and perhaps unnecessary? But I'm grasping at negative straws because I have to go with my gut and how much I enjoyed this. I thought the pacing was perfect and it was just a wonderful romance about love and life. I am forever enamoured with About Time. 9/10"

","About Time is full of really nice people who love each other, and you want nothing but good things for all of them. And that often turns out to be possible, thanks to the Lake family secret. All the Lake men have a limited ability to travel backward in time — only to earlier points in their own lives, true (""We can't go back and kill Hitler or anything.""), but usually getting a 2nd run at various awkwardnesses and infelicities is all it takes to smooth out life's little bumps and jolts.<br/><br/>Aside from the time travel, the biggest imagination-stretcher is that Rachel McAdams's Mary is a single gal in London in her early 20s and doesn't have a boyfriend. Our hero, the gawky but endearing Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson), recognizes the cosmic injustice in that and determines to use his powers for good (or, in this case, love). But between his wistful adieu from the shy, plain girl he's met in a lights-out bistro and getting set to call the number she's punched into his cell phone, he performs a good deed for a friend, and it turns out that his little jaunt into the past has erased his evening's conversation with Mary from her memory and her number from his phone.<br/><br/>That's about the highest level of stress this film ever reaches. It's the farthest thing on Earth from an action-adventurer. It's mainly a love story with minor elements of comedy (sometimes it takes several re-runs at the past to get things just right, and we see the failed attempts in quick succession) and pathos.<br/><br/>It's written and directed by Richard Curtis, who earlier did About a Boy and Notting Hill, so you know he's got the characterization down cold, and Bill Nighy, Lydia Wilson, Lindsay Duncan, Tom Hollander, Richard Cordery, and Margot Robbie are pitch-perfect in supporting roles. And, if I didn't emphasize it strongly enuf earlier, you'll really like all of these people, even the crusty curmudgeonly playwright Harry.<br/><br/>Go see the movie.You won't be sorry.

","Greetings viewers. Welcome to the saccharine world of Richard Curtis where, just like ALL his other cinematic concoctions, love conquers all and life is fulfilled - as long as you happen to live in a fantasy version of London where a) it's always summer b) you live in (the incredibly expensive) St. John's Wood/Maida Vale area, c) ethnic minorities are non-existent, d) everyone has a middle class job in law, the arts or publishing, e) children never cry - they are just massively cute all the time, f) you have wealthy parents rattling around in a huge house by the sea, g) you have a kooky sister and an eccentric uncle for comedy relief and h) you are a less handsome but not unattractive ginger version of Hugh Grant. Curtis' storytelling template never waivers from the success of FOUR WEDDINGS and NOTTING HILL and this derivative bilge is the 21st century equivalent of ""All Americans still think London is foggy, lit by gas lamps and transported by horse and carriage."" Oh, and don't forget - if you need a passage of time let's have a montage set to a bland love song that takes place in a single location. The writer's claim that no adjustments are made to suit US cinema-going sensibilities is plainly untrue. One of the most truly awful, shamelessly manufactured examples of cinematic product I've ever had the misfortune to witness."

","This film failed it seriously. It's below mediocre. Were it shorter, I'd think it would be a pilot episode of a sitcom that didn't make it. The time-travel is a gimmick that is explored ad nauseam. Also, it is more paradoxal than the average sci-fi time travel, to the point one just gives up trying to understand the timeline logic at a given time in the film. The ""rules"" of time travel posed by Tim's father were broken several times, and at a given time it even seems to have a ""cancel"" button, making Tim potentially an immortal lord of life and death... that always acts as silly as a teenager. I though the movie would end and the credits would roll several times. Whenever that happens in a rom-com, you can bet the it fails at something, even if you happen to like the individual situations. These seem to have been glued together, as the movie just seems to be lingering about ""Tim, love and life"". It could go on and on until either Tim dies of old age or the audience of boredom... or it could be a sitcom. The jokes are not funny. It's awkward. Tim himself is awkward and time travel gives him the chances not to be awkward with this UNBREAKABLE TIME-TRAVEL RULE: he transfers his awkwardness to the movie as he travels.

The ginger leading man is also mildly irritating and not much fun to look at, his plum-in-the-mouth dialect being representative of the kind of people in England who are generally extremely annoying too (to you Americans reading this, almost no normal person in the UK speaks like that - just the over- privileged). <br/><br/>True, I'm no fan of romcoms, but many are sufferable if they at least manage to hold your attention for their under 90 minutes running time. But 123 minutes of blandness? I'm afraid not. I just sat there wondering when something was going to happen.....and then the yawns set in.<br/><br/>Its so unsettling that so many people here have given this drab grey shade of a movie ten stars, and calling it the ""best film you've ever seen"" c'mon..? Honestly people, can you just not make statements like that on here anymore? I mean please? You really are contributing nothing as it shows just how few films you've ever seen. The title however for the film is actually brilliant, because when it finally dragged to the end I cheered out loud.... ""About Time!"""

","This movie is beyond standards we are used to. It is warm, human story and time traveling part is brilliantly incorporated. Only cinematography masters can pull this kind of story into a good movie, but this movie is not good, its excellent!Casting is perfect. Dad and Uncle are simply brilliant in their performances. I really enjoyed every single minute, and had a few good laughs.This movie is not for fun-action packed movie lovers...<br/><br/>I think it showed that you don't have to have special effect circus if you are doing a time traveling movie. <br/><br/>Rachel McAdamss performance is not in the range of all the other actors and actresses, but never the less, it is acceptable."
"ashik-k","2","36","85","11 November 2013"," Temporal Weaknesses galore
","The movie is meant to be a chick-flick sort of affair, and my wife and I were all for it. However, I left the theater with my intelligence being fully insulted. The creators of the film should not be able to abuse the rules of their fictional account to the benefit of simply moving a story forward, especially rules they've created themselves. The suspension of disbelief was shattered, and in movies dealing with time, the awe and majesty of such an ability were never truly conveyed. Not even in terms of love and endearment. Furthermore, the moral quandaries of time travel and eternal life were abruptly placed together near the end of the film, but the message was not earned. Lastly, this was not an original idea. Ground Hog Day did it better.<br/><br/>The trailer for this movie was phenomenal. The idea to travel through time via one's memory was fascinating. However, this movie broke all of the rules in temporal time travel, including the rules for time travel used during the movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, there was an underlying impression that only the men of the family could travel through time. This rule was broken when the main character took his sister back through time. Second, there was a rule that he couldn't travel to the future. However, when one goes to the past to change something, the future is also permanently affected. Yet, in the film, he manages to go to the past and to this new future (that no longer exists, that he was no longer a part of), seamlessly. To tie together the first broken rule; how far back did he need to go in order to undo how he changed his sister's past/future? How did he end up in a future he had erased? Third, one could potentially, live forever. The movie put a constraint on this as it nicely put an emphasis on developing relationships with his family. However, the mortality of it all, even when dealing with his father's death (really, suicide) is hardly ever dealt with considering the scope of their powers. Fourth, during the love scene, he makes a joke that presumes he is tired. But how can he be tired if he traveled back in time? Other then retaining his memories, all other aspects of his physical well-being, his energy levels, and his health, should all be unaffected. <br/><br/>There were other fundamental flaws. The love between his wife and himself felt highly one-sided. She seems to have settled for him as soon as he managed to interject her path. The main character, persistently leads a double life since he never tells his wife about his abilities. In other words, his love is a lie and arguments and all other incidents involved in real love could be avoided. For example, during their first argument, his reaction was to run away and turn back time. The powers to travel through time were kept acute...meaning that the guy never used it to better society or the world at large. Everything felt so...small...and the gravity of the ability was never truly felt."

","In Cornwall, the clumsy Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) lives a pleasant life with his family but he is awkward with the girls and unlucky in love. At the age of twenty one, his father (Bill Nighy) discloses a family secret to him, telling that the men in his family have the ability to travel in time. The skeptic Tim finds that his father is telling the truth and when he moves to London to work as a lawyer, he falls in love with the insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams) and seduces her fixing his mistakes in the relationship. Along his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.<br/><br/>""About Time"" is an overrated movie about a clumsy guy that discovers that he has the ability of traveling in time and uses his skill to fix mistakes in life. The plot is a sort of ""Butterfly Effect"" of love, but is repetitive and tiresome. The lovely Margot Robbie and the smile of Rachel McAdams save this movie from a fiasco since Domhnall Gleeson is too dull for a lead role.

","Just awful. I enjoyed the Time Traveler's Wife, and this was like that except lacking everything that made that movie interesting, with hardly any significant, interesting time travel and a boring, pathetic loser for a main character who never grows at all throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The film doesn't make you care at all about ANY of the characters, in fact, because it never really tries to. The only ""tear jerking"" that happens is because of the sappy music and the marriage and baby stuff that some women love to fawn over despite the lack of connection to any of the characters in the film.<br/><br/>It drags on especially toward the end for no real apparent reason other than to add to the sap appeal for the characters that we have no connection whatsoever to because, again, none was ever developed.<br/><br/>The reviews promised a chick flick that men could actually enjoy. It did not deliver whatsoever. I can't see anyone with taste enjoying this film.<br/><br/>Rated 2 because the first 20 minutes were somewhat interesting."

To be fair to Curtis he has thought about cause and effect.<br/><br/>The best scenes are with Tim and his father. It is a genuine, warm relationship so you can guess that his father is going to bite the dust.<br/><br/>I never got any chemistry between Gleeson and MacAdams.

You'd think it a preposterous storyline but it's given great heart and sentiment. All the actors are wonderful but a special mention for the understated joy of Bill Nighy as Tim's dad .

","What do you want from a 'Feel Good' movie?
simple - ""You should Feel Good"" after watching it. That is exactly the movie ""About Time"" gave me.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, it is a movie about Time Travel. But it never felt like a sci-fi film at all. it is about love and relationships.
The love of a father and son, Love of a couple, Love of a brother and in short- the story of some warm and loving people. The story of a young man who is not an 'Alpha male' like a regular movie hero. He is sensitive, emotional and shy like most of us. So the character feels so connected to me.
The movie Shows his beautiful family and a beautiful romantic relationship which made me feel to have that in my life too.<br/><br/>More than a movie it was a beautiful experience which made a lasting 'feel good' feeling.

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>First off, the only romance films I have ever truly like were the Before Series films. This film is a touching and very original story. The dealing with time travel is never explained which kind of a downer is, but the romance story is moving and powerful. The film elegantly introduces us to the characters and lets us connect with them. We see their personalities and their love of family. The ending is touching and really hit home.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams have great chemistry and both perform very well. Bill Nighy delivers a very sobering performance as a loving father about to lose his son. Lydia Wilson, Lindsay Duncan, Richard Cordery, Joshua McGuire, Tom Hollander, Margot Robbie, Will Merrick, and Vanessa Kirby all are great side characters that add so much to the story.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is slow but it introduces us to the time travel aspect very early. The runtime is a little overlong.<br/><br/>Pros: Touching, powerful, and original plot, great ending, Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams and their great chemistry, good side characters, and Bill Nighy and his story is very touching<br/><br/>Cons: The ability to time travel are never explained, slow pacing, and an overlong runtime<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.2"
"Rick NYC-2","Null","3","4","20 November 2015"," A happy little tearjerker that presses all your buttons
","10 stars! About Time is the Ultimate chick flick. The love match between Tim and Mary, Domhnall (""DOUGH-i-null"") Gleeson and Rachel McAdams, will be a thing of legend. They are not A- list heartthrobs like Pitt and Jolie, but their off-beat adorableness makes them lovable and relatable. We, ourselves, with proper diet and exercise, could possibly be as lovely as they are. So we identify with them from the get-go.<br/><br/>The gag is that Tim and all the men in this family have a special gift of being able to go back in their own past just by wishing to do it (but not the historic past--only the past that they are personally part of) whenever they feel the need to, so that they can redo things, to correct anything that went wrong. Sound familiar? Yes, this is definitely a rip off of Groundhog Day, and some purists may find it to be an artistic no-no to borrow from a film so beloved, but it's not exactly the same because they don't only redo the same day. They can go back to their childhood, or yesterday. Of course, as with all time-travel movies, we have to avoid asking any of those annoying ""Butterfly"" questions about screwing up world reality, or the reality of what is in the time traveler's mind after he comes back from changing the past. Like what else changed in between? But Tim never changes anything too far back, or world shattering--mostly recent little things, like changing the way he talked to a girl or moving strategically to a different room in order to avoid meeting somebody.<br/><br/>There are two major relationships in this movie: the boy-girl love affair, and the father and son's mutual adoration. We may cry a lot--not for them, but for ourselves, thinking, maybe unconsciously, how much better we wish our father-son relationships were/had been. Boy oh boy! Tim and Dad hug a lot and even kiss and we love them for it. If we can get past our own pain. <br/><br/>Dad doesn't use his time travel power to make a killing in the stock market. (His uncle got filthy rich and ended up miserable and alone.) No, Dad goes back to summer afternoons so that he can read more of the classics than it's humanly possible to read in a normal life time. He's a retired professor. (How did he buy that house? Old money?)<br/><br/>There is one little beef I have with this idyllic tale. This is a privileged family of leisure, with a small mansion on the beach, and they don't have seem to have any of the problems that we huddled masses have (except for the relentless march of time that we are all subject to). They are White, thin, healthy, comfortable, well employed (Tim goes to London to become a lawyer), and they are all able to enjoy games of tennis and walks on the beach and seemingly without any stress from one another or the outside world. Okay, the daughter drinks a bit too much, but the family remains loving and happy like the Nelsons or the Cleavers. (Sorry for the old reference. I'm 62.)<br/><br/>This privileged life allows Tim to worry about girls without being troubled by all the nuisances that may bother the rest of us. And the two leads are so infectiously adorable, and their friends and colleagues are so much fun, that we go on the ride that sails by like a dream. It's a cinematic delight, with beach landscapes, cliffs, the ocean, beautiful homes and apartments in both London and Cornwall, and parties filled with lovely furnishings and sexy lads and lasses. The two lead actors are top-notch, and so is Bill Nighy as Dad. They are so invested in one another, so we smile, we laugh, we get misty-eyed, we cry, and finally, we sob if we are not afraid to, over their triumphs, joys, infatuations, loves, and the pains that even the privileged are occasionally heir to.<br/><br/>I'm glad I watched it at home, alone, because I dread coming apart--like I did--in a crowded theater. I imagine that many manly young men will slake this movie because of how expertly, and relentlessly, it presses one's buttons. But I, for one, think Richard Curtis is a genius, and I'm glad he pressed mine."

","I watched this movie with my young teen daughter who is just discovering how clueless and well-meaning the young men in her life are. There is a freshness and charm about allowing a young man to bumble through his relationships and life trying again, and again, to learn life's lessons about choosing the right words and deeds to carry out his good intentions. Wouldn't we all like to have a second or third take on some of the key scenes in our teens and twenties? The women in the film do revolve around the men. But they are more than cheerleaders. They have depth and love and autonomy. Finally, the father/son relationship is worth the price of the ticket. Our sons and brothers and fathers need honest, bumbling, believable film role models to help them forgive themselves and love each other. This film accomplishes that."

"Rickting","7","3","4","27 December 2014"," Rom com with charm, visual splendour and various flaws
","Richard Cutis rolls out another sentimental, charming and brilliantly British rom com with About Time. This time, it's boy meets girl. Boy can travel in time. A romantic comedy with a time travel twist, AT has various shortcomings but is overall pleasant and reasonably well done. Richard Curtis writes and directs the film, and he shows his skill as a director as the visuals are excellent. The script has other issues, but much of the drama feels real and the jokes and funny without resorting to vulgarity. The humour's fairly original and you can't see all of the jokes coming. Things are repeated thanks to the involvement of time travel but it doesn't grow repetitive. This is a sentimental film but not in an overly cloying way and some of the dramatic moments are genuinely emotional, but in a calm, unforced sort of way. The acting is good all around, but the standout is Bill Nighy as the father, who's performance sparkles with both pathos and dry wit. AT is a touching and funny film overall, but it has several problems which become more apparent in the second half.<br/><br/>While the sentimentality is fine, it's inevitably a bit soppy. The problem with AT is that there's not a lot of point. Once the central relationship gets going there's no conflict or threat, and instead the film goes into other underdeveloped subplots. The film drifts from event to event without actually saying much or offering any obstacles to the characters, and leaves various plot holes in its wake. AT has some rather problematic messages, and the implication that the main character could not have had his successes or his romances without the time travel is a bit offensive. A lot of the time, you can't quite see where it's going. AT certainly lacks urgency or true conflict, but it's well executed and enjoyable enough for that to be overlooked and all in all it's another triumph for Working Title. Many will enjoy this and it might even be a tear jerking movie for some. It hasn't got an awful lot of logic to it but it doesn't necessarily need it. It's no Back To The Future, but it does time travel in an interesting and less formulaic way than other time travel films.<br/><br/>7/10"

I hope that my kids do and are not too bored when I force this film down their throats.<br/><br/>I have to add more lines so I will say that it is a cliché. It is a classic English mirage ... as much as Amelie Poulain is a mirage of real Paris. I'm not sure that that is such a bad thing.

This movie is about us and the way we see hours, minutes, seconds wasted away and how little do we care about living and, most of all, perceiving those around us: family, friends, even strangers. There's a whole world beyond our noses going unnoticed to us... just because we are too busy doing things that may not make us completely (or even slightly) happy. Not for an Oscar but cares. Little precious jewels have to be minimal, ethereal. Just like this movie: small but significant. Yeah, right, take your tissues. You will desperately and happily need them."

","Yes, this is a romantic movie, but if you aren't found of love stories it's still worth watching.<br/><br/>It tells us about how important is to cherish the simple moments in life and how they are *in most cases* the most important parts of our life, if we pay attention to them.<br/><br/>The actors are very well suited for the movie and it feels that everything is just in place, making every piece of it just very pleasurable to watch.<br/><br/>Even if you don't believe on that culture-imposed information that everybody needs someone to be happy, you can take out all of that and just enjoy the trip."

","I like movies. I saw a lot of movies. I love my dad, and he's still alive. This movie touched me very deeply on how I think about my own life.<br/><br/>So simple but so deep, incredible!!! And if you have a difficult relation with your dad, I encourage you to watch it. the acting is so natural, and the usual life situations so well relived. Time traveling let you think again , and again about human relations and family problems, in a so simple way that is somewhat astonishing. I completely agree with one reviewer that wishes to have the ability to travel in time to watch this movie for the first time again. I'm 57 and I strongly recommend this movie"
"SnoopyStyle","8","3","4","6 September 2014"," The best time traveling rom-com
","When Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) turns 21, his father (Bill Nighy) tells him that men in his family can travel through time. His sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) brings Charlotte (Margot Robbie) to stay for the summer. His power is unable to make the beautiful Charlotte fall for him. He moves to London and stays with bitter playwright Harry (Tom Hollander). He has a wonderful night with the magical Mary (Rachel McAdams). However Harry had a horrible opening night for his play. He goes back in time to fix it but his magical night with Mary disappears. He uses his power but also finds some limitations.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis creates the one of the best time traveling rom-com. Gleeson is likable and adorkable. McAdams is magically adorable. She is dating down a bit but the two has good chemistry nevertheless. The time traveling could have gone horribly wrong. The first steps help alleviate a good deal of it. My biggest fear for this movie is that Tim would use his powers to keep changing history to force Mary to fall for him. The fact that he couldn't get Charlotte helps and that Mary falls for him without his powers is also very important. It culminates in one of the more profound ways to use time travel."
"kellyferris87","10","3","4","24 August 2014"," Wow!
","I just finished watching this absolutely genius film, simply delightful in the way it creates emotions and draws you into the plot. Although, at first it seems slow, the film and the characters are just teasing you into the world which it sets to unleash. This film takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions and allows you time and essence to absorb them and feel the feelings the film is portraying. The simple plot makes life seem simple and all the woes we have so silly. This film carefully constructs its meaning around societies meaning of perfection and a happy life. <br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyed and certainly laughed and shed a tear."
"perkypops","9","3","4","20 July 2014"," Mr Curtis is on top form with this rom-com with a difference
","There are touches of deja vu in this film which cleverly stitches in time travel to a love story encompassing all the central characters. First and foremost it is about love both romantic and familial, but with a couple of characters who can play little tricks with time. Not all the time trips go as planned but they always provide food for thought. There are the usual Curtis-marked laugh out loud moments, the careful casting of the leads, the flawed diamonds of characters that always bejewel Mr Curtis's scripts, and the tragedies that open our eyes so very successfully. Through all their faults the lead characters are such believable characters, and, as usual for Mr Curtis, the token American character, this time Rachel McAdams, is perfectly cast.<br/><br/>Perhaps Mr Curtis is guilty of formula writing you may say, and you'd have a point, but just like his use of rain and foul weather, he manages to freshen it all up and keep us guessing until the end. It's a formula others copy but no one does it better than the director himself.<br/><br/>And so if you want to watch a heart warming rom-com does very professionally then this is up there with the best.<br/><br/>Nine out of ten as a film, but ten out of ten for the lead actors - all of them."

","I adored this movie. I'm not sure why people didn't enjoy it. I found it to be Richard Curtis's best work so far. So much heart and soul, stark reality, pain and love. He captured how we should all be and not allow the stresses of our lives to keep us from enjoying what is truly important to us. It is well acted. I laughed and cried. The beach scene was just a tearjerker and I rarely cry at movies. The scene where he discovers that Posy wouldn't have been born and the beach scene were my favorite. Bill Nighy is wonderful in this movie. Rachel McAdams has such depth as an actress, she can really draw you in and portrays her characters with her ability to laugh so deeply that she is just adorable. How can anyone not like her? Plus Domhall Gleeson was wonderful as Tim. As with Love Actually, this move was wonderfully cast. I don't get too upset with far fetched movies like The Lake House or like this one, it's a movie, it's an escape. I don't understand why people want to write reviews how the time travel aspect doesn't make sense. Most movies don't make logical sense. Look at Star Wars, everyone loved that movie but was it possible? Who cares, it's a movie. It's a two hour break from the stress in your life. I adore Richard Curtis and I really think this movie is wonderful."
"TxMike","Null","3","4","29 April 2014"," Charming time-travel story, with elements of 'Groundhog Day.'
","I wasn't sure what to expect, I got the DVD from my public library and purposely avoided seeing the trailer, they usually reveal too much. So when Tim turned 21 and his dad pulled him aside, and told him the men of their family all are born with the ability to time-travel, it was a complete surprise to me.<br/><br/>The time-travel has constraints, you can only travel to a prior time, one that you have lived and can now imagine. You simply go into a darkened closet or room, clinch your fists, close your eyes, and imagine the exact time you want to go back to. Later, clench your fists again and go back to the present.<br/><br/>It has some elements of 'Groundhog Day' where Phil learns a bit more each day about how to snare the girl of his dreams. Here, when Tim makes an awkward and unsuccessful approach, all he has to do is go back a few minutes and try it over.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is really good as Tim who, after he turns 21, goes to London to live and work as a lawyer. At one point his lawyer friend comments that Tim is really good, when it looks like he is sure to lose a case he somehow comes up with something to win. Time-travel, obviously, although they don't dwell on it.<br/><br/>When in London he meets up with Rachel McAdams (one of my favorites) as American Mary, living and working in London as a 'reader' for a book publishing firm. His meeting her gets a bit complicated, as when he travels back to fix a different problem for a friend, thus missing the actual meeting time for Mary, has to devise a different way to gain her friendship, and eventual love.<br/><br/>If simply described in writing the premise can sound a bit 'hokey' but in fact is very good and presents many meaningful and humorous situations. One is being able to visit dad, played well by Bill Nighy , to recreate some moments from when Tim was a child. Or to have some last moments with dad after he gets sick. <br/><br/>The whole story spans perhaps 8 to 10 years, judging by the ages of the eventual children. The overarching message in the movie is to enjoy every day, and enjoy the people around you. The rest is fantasy, for entertainment, and it works very well.<br/><br/>It was also nice seeing Lindsay Duncan again, playing Tim's mother. She was Ann Mayle in the 1990s mini-series ""A Year in Provence"" which I enjoyed so much I have the DVD set."

","A Rom Com with Time Travel! Or so I thought, and clearly, why, ever would any self- respecting male watch a romantic comedy with time travel? That's why I did not watch this movie in the theater. Turns out that was a huge mistake - I missed the best movie of 2013.<br/><br/>This film has a very clear, simple, and truthful message. What sets it apart is how it's making its point - in the most elegant, beautiful way possible.<br/><br/>The premise is simple - what if you had the ability to do anything over again? And again? As many times as you want, until you're happy with it? What would you do? The movie proceeds to explore this question and it finds an unexpected, entirely beautiful conclusion. On the surface it's an entertaining ride watching a young man grow up - if it was just that it would still be better than most ""romantic"" movies out there: It's funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously, it's clever. But on a secondary level it contains a deeper meaning, and that makes it stand out and puts it up there with the best movies I've seen.<br/><br/>PS: How this can have an average of 7.x is beyond me. The only explanation is that maybe part of the audience just doesn't get it, or isn't ready?"

"doug_park2001","8","3","4","12 April 2014"," ""All the time travel in the world can't make someone love you""
","ABOUT TIME is a fantasy-comedy where a subject we often wonder about becomes reality for its protagonist. What if we could go back in time and redo our bad decisions, erase every faux pas, remove all our foots-in-mouth, etc? <br/><br/>Though quietly funny and entertaining, the first half-hour or so meanders a bit, but things pick up, and the last half-hour is powerfully moving. ABOUT TIME is seldom just laugh-out-loud funny; however, there is a quietly whimsical humor throughout. Good acting by Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, as well as by everyone else, but the best of all comes from Bill Nighy as Tim's dad, a truly memorable character. The cinematography is also excellent, with some fine views of the Cornwall, England, coast. Great script and great soundtrack too. Despite the fantastic elements, this is a film about real people that, like many British productions, moves at the speed of life. Therefore, people who want a lot of excitement and explosive action may be a little bored with it."

","I took a chance watching this film hoping it wouldn't be a waste of time. As dramas go, there are no villains, and the cathartic moments are so small it might require some life experience to understand them.<br/><br/>We follow Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who learns he's able to go back in time on his twenty first birthday from his father. Tim immediately informs his father he'll use it to get a girlfriend... which he does manage to pull off. I suspect more than half the world's men will identify with Tim.<br/><br/>Mary (Rachel McAdams) deliver's a wonderful performance as a young woman who recognizes her insecurities but has no solution for them... and perhaps those insecurities serve her well as she's met Tim who jumps through a lot of hoops to connect with her... those hoops being time travel.<br/><br/>Even though time travel is part of the film, it does not dominate or overwhelm it. Its simply a plot device that allows Tim to grow and learn what is truly important.<br/><br/>Films with a well delivered message are rare these days. This one is a true gem."

A boy gets told by his dad on his 21's birthday that he can travel back in time, he decided to use it to fined true love. The performance from Domhnall Gleeson was unexpected but truthful and you can't help but relate to his character. Bill Nighty should take all the credit for this film, his portrayal of a somewhat estranged and distant father who really loves his son more than anything brought me to tears more than once.

","I really liked this movie and when I saw the actress of the movie "" The notebook"" as the main actress I said: I am going to like this one. I was right.

It leaves a beautiful message at the end, that we are all time travelers. That we have to live our day by day with all the stress it has, but also looking all the beauty around in each of our days. That even if you would have the chance to live each day of your life twice, there is nothing like living it, just once.<br/><br/>It moved me in every way and this is the reason why movies are done for. This is the reason why you go to a theater for. You do not go to a theater because of the visual effects or the 3D effects, you also go to be moved in some way and when a movie leaves you with that feeling of meditation or maybe going over your head over and over some of the scenes it has accomplished it's goal.<br/><br/>If it leaves you talking about it for a few days it means it was worth the view."

","Expect to be in for a jolly good ride if a film is both written and directed by Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Love Actually). Add a fine cast of actors, a bit of a kink with time travel (of sorts) and out comes this little British confection perfect for Valentine's Day – or any day when an uplifting bit of romantic fluff is needed.<br/><br/>The setting for the most part is Cornwall and the film is narrated by 21year old Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) who is awkward with finding a girlfriend and in general unlucky in love, as played out in a rather disastrous New Year's Eve party. But things change when Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, and then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend, playwright Harry (Tom Hollander) from professional disaster, and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. During his life, Tim uses his gift to fix not only his errors, but also in the lives of his relatives and friends.<br/><br/>Tim's family is a bit on the loony side and in addition to Bill Nighy as his wondrously gifted father, there is Lindsay Duncan is his mum, Richard Cordery is his space cadet Uncle D and Lydia Wilson is his sister nutty but sweet sister Kit Kat. Margot Robbie, Vanessa Kirby, Will Merrick and Tom Hughes offer excellent cameos. The time travel idea peters out once the film has started but the idea has been planted and helps make this frothy film float. 'We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.'"

"obawankanabi","10","4","6","12 October 2018"," Innocent Pleasure
","Inception, Looper, Predestination, X Men: Days of Future Past, Interstellar, Dunkirk, Memento, and Pulp Fiction- Hollywood and the moviegoers of the world have become enamored by the mind bending, analysis necessitating complexity of non-linear storytelling. As viewers of these films, we cannot lazily follow the string of the story. We must be attentive and tenacious to grasp the full experience. These films are beautifully knitted together. Perhaps as audience members, we feel that we are the ones who untangle every loop and knot until we are left with individual strings. The truth is, we are not the ones doing the work. That is not why people go to the movies. People go to Ward 16 Consolidated Theatres to lay back on new recliner chairs and munch on concessions. Not to solve mental mazes. It is the job of the cast and crew to challenge us with the mystery, and then politely present to us the answers. We get the delightful sensation of solving a puzzle without doing any of the work. Perhaps we love the momentary struggle, or maybe it is in our human nature. Either way, we have grown heavily attached to this film genre. Directors such as Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino have earned the respect of the common moviegoer with narrative complexity in their films. The sheer amount of thought that goes into creating these narratives is unimaginable. It takes extreme discipline and wit to remain within the structure of the film while dodging the plot holes. These films have gained so much popularity that they have inspired writers and directors to create similar films. So much so that some audience's youthful enthusiasms for the genre eventually withered out and turned into pessimistic annoyance. About Time was released when time travel movies seemed to pop up every week. Directed by Richard Curtis, About Time is a product of the popularization of time travel and non-linear storytelling in Hollywood. The initial review by critics did not bode well for the film. Many pointed to the blatant plot holes within the film, and with a 55% rating on Metacritic and a 68% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, only the rare enthusiast would admit the movie is above average. However as time passed, the movie gained popularity and became a surprise hit in South Korea. 93% percent of Google users say that they like the movie. The light hearted sentimentality of the movie caught the hearts of people across the globe. Despite its origins, About Time ignores the common narrative conventions of time travel and proves that the powerful combination of charm and self awareness can more than compensate for a neglect of structural rules. Those who are simply looking for a relaxing time at the movies will love About Time. 
About Time was released during a period where time travel movies were very popular and almost becoming a gimmick in Hollywood. Movies like Hot Tub Time Machine satirize this overuse of the time travel trope. The movie pulls inspiration from movies like Groundhog Day that mix the sci-fi aspect of time travel with realistic everyday life. Richard Curtis made a lot of romantic comedy movies such as Love Actually and Notting Hill. During the initial release of the film, About Time, many critics pointed out the plot holes that were left in the movie. Just one year prior, another time travel movie, Looper was released. Many debated over the effect of plot holes on the quality of Looper as well. There is one video where the writer/director of Looper, Rian Johnson is explaining the reasoning behind leaving the plot holes in that movie. In the interview, he states that the plot holes were a result of a conscious artistic choice. He says, ""There is a slight amount of magical logic that you have to apply in order to make a story like this make sense."" Is this a valid statement? Or is Rian Johnson just rationalizing his inability to write a impermeable screenplay? It would be unreasonable to assume a renowned writer such as Rian Johnson is lying about this. Furthermore, Rian Johnson surely has the skills to write a plot-hole-free screenplay. He broke into the scene with the critically acclaimed film, Brick, and has gone on to contribute to blockbusters such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi. A writer of such expertise would not settle for anything less than excellent in his mind. There is a very high chance that the plot holes in Looper were indeed an intentional artistic choice. There are parallels between About Time and Looper. If we are compromising our logic to believe that a human can time travel by closing his eyes in the dark, then why can't we use a little more of our ""magical logic"" to accept minor plot holes?
Most would agree that Richard Curtis was not trying to create a narrative masterpiece when he was writing About Time. This however, does not mean that it is a low quality movie. About Time is delightfully charming and lighthearted. The sentimental moments strike at perfect times. With realistic dialogue and witty humor, About Time humbly reminds us to enjoy the seemingly unimportant moments in our own lives. Within the film, the protagonist discovers how all of the men in his family have the ability to time travel. After years of using his powers in self interest, the protagonist realizes the limits to his powers and his father lets him in on his ""secret formula to happiness."" The father's secret, is that he only uses his powers to relive his life in the exact way he lived it the first time around. The whole message of the film is to enjoy the little moments. Richard Curtis wants the audience to simply enjoy life for what it is. The film wants us as an audience to simply enjoy the film: a charming, quirky story. The theme of the film compliments the simplicity of the story. Of course About Time is not a narrative masterpiece, but that was never the intent. About Time is very self aware. The protagonist is very relatable. He is not a buff, overbearingly masculine character. He is just an average awkward guy that happens to have the ability to time travel. 
Throughout the movie the protagonist, Tim, played by Domhnall Gleeson, predictably does what all of us wouldn't admit to doing if we were gifted the power to time travel. A protagonist who has a 1/10 morality rating should not cause the movie to be 1/10 in quality. Many of these reviews fixated on the simplicity of the film as if simplicity is a bad thing. ""Ordinary"" was a word used a lot to criticize the characters as if ordinary is bad.a
Television shows like The Office and Parks and Recreation are loved by America because they give us a peer into the lives of relatable characters. Relatability is what caused The Office to become a sensation. The movies are often represented as an opportunity to momentarily escape from reality, but if someone were to say that movies should only function as an escape, they would be terribly wrong. Films can function as an escape from reality, but also as propaganda, memorabilia, education, and more. About Time knows its intention, and as a simple rom-com, it beautifully achieves its own goals. 
About Time sparks an interesting argument because there will be a point where interpretation of intent matters. If we assume that the intention was to leave in the plot holes as a sacrifice to maintain the theme of finding beauty in mundanity, then my argument would work. On the other hand, if we assume that there was no intent of having plot holes and it was simply a mistake, then I would probably switch my argument. However, I have come to the conclusion that there was intent to leave in the plot holes because the simplicity of the story adds to the message of the movie. Moreover, the movie does such a great job of camouflaging the plot holes and the chances of that being a product of coincidence is super low. Film traditionalists who despise plot holes should ask themselves a question: why? Why would a plot hole ruin a film if its purpose is to remind the audience to enjoy the simplicities of life. If a movie achieves its goal, shouldn't it be considered a success? For people who enjoy tv shows like The Office or Parks and Recreation, this movie would be perfect. All of these shows have a theme that is based on finding the beauty in mundanity. Many people refer to movies similar to About Time as ""guilty pleasures,"" but it is perfectly within our right to enjoy simple films with simple goals."

"blanche-2","10","4","6","24 January 2016"," one of the loveliest films I have ever seen
","""About Time"" from 2013 is a beautiful story, beautifully told.<br/><br/>A young man, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) learns from his father that he can travel in time; it's a gift shared by all the men in the family and kept secret from anyone else. All he has to do is find a dark place, clench his fists, and decide what he wants to relive.<br/><br/>He can't alter history, but he can redo certain incidents so he does better. The one thing he wants is a girlfriend. Moving from Cornwall to London to work as an attorney, he meets the pretty, sweet Mary (Rachel McAdams) and, after a do-over, develops a relationship with her, and they begin to build a life together.<br/><br/>Though his gift comes in handy, saving his playwright friend from an opening night horror, his wedding from awful best man speeches, and helping his sister (this took a couple of time hops), Tim finds that his gift can't keep him from life's inevitable sorrows. <br/><br/>I'm tempted to say this was a lovely movie where nothing happens, except that life happens, in all its happiness, and poignancy and bittersweet moments. It's the kind of movie that can make a man cry, the emotions are so real.<br/><br/>I've never been a huge fan of Bill Nighy's, who plays Tim's father - I have seen in dozens of films. He is wonderful here, as a funny, loving father. Lindsay Duncan, a fantastic actress -- I saw her on Broadway in ""Private Lives,"" is great as Tim's mother.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams always reminds of Jennifer Garner, which is a compliment to Garner since she's a bit older. McAdams has a sweet, gentle presence, and she's delightful in this film.<br/><br/>Then we get to the lead, Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a somewhat gawky young man who projects warmth and humor that really carries this film.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is top-notch: Lydia Wilson, Richard Cordery, Joshua McGuire, and Tom Hollander.<br/><br/>A magical film about life's journey, whether you can time travel or not."

He try to change his mistake returning the past. Also,he can get a girlfriend and marry her. Of course, he challenged many times. The scenes are funny, we can laugh at that because they seem as if NG scenes. I think he is cunning, but he finally notices the importance of days.

The movie is seriously a ""must-watch"" for anyone that has ever found himself not appreciating the wonders in their own lives. It's truly beautiful in its complexity, and I highly recommend the movie. I love this movie and it totally grasps the human part without being weird.

"BeneCumb","8","4","6","17 April 2015"," Recognisable Curtis, but still pleasant to follow
","Richard Curtis is a sign of certain quality in the British cinema, even in the event of recurrent approaches, scenes and topics, e.g. laugh between tears, ups and downs in romance, giggling moments amidst ""serious"" scenes, colourful supporting characters, and last but not least - a wedding scene... Anyhow, there is always a new angle, and in spite of some disharmony and flaws in the plot, About Time is definitely another ""well-done"" creation, with fine performances even in supporting roles (particularly Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, Rachel McAdams as Mary, Bill Nighy as Dad, Tom Hollander as Harry).<br/><br/>The role of sci-fi was not too big (good for me :)), so the film is apparently not for genuine fantasy and fiction lovers, and the amount of big laugh opportunities is lower than e.g. Four Wedding and a Funeral, and Love Actually... Bearing that in mind, I am sure that if you have liked Curtis' concepts, you will have a pleasant and warm-hearted 2 hours in front of TV screen."

It contains that source that we need in our life and which, I think, we are waiting from movies and other arts. But, despite this, it's not getting us a false hopes. Definitely not. It's about time. Time is one of the most important, complex and non understandable things in our life. And this movie tries to give some point of view to this thing. And I think they succeeded in it.

Well, it took me several times of watching until I was able to finish it. The first time I got bored. I felt like nothing interesting was happening, and I didn't understand why it was about ""that girl Caroline"" when I'd seen that the movie was supposed to have Rachel McAdams in it. The second time I watched about half way through, but didn't have the time to finish it. And lastly, the third time I finally finished it and cried. *spoiler* I really liked Bill Nighy's character and him dying made me very sad. That was when I realised how good the movie was, and I have now watched it many times. The plots are good and the scene when after he's travelled in time and comes home and finds another child than his daughter Posy is scary but interesting at the same time because he realises that he can't travel in time all the time.

This IS NOT one of those stories, yet its still a great story about love and time travel without so much heartache (in my opinion). Very well done for that to Richard Curtis who was writer and director. I didn't think a movie like this was possible, i love that you have proved me wrong in this. I solute you and from now on i will follow your work closely. I thought for sure after looking at the previews and seeing Rachel Mcadams this was going to be a depressing and yet mesmerizing love story...like all the others. If you're like me looking for a movie that's just good from beginning to end where you learn lessons about love and loss without completely making every mistake the first time, instead just learning how to go through them the right way. This movie is the movie for you. 9 out of ten...just because? i save the 10s i guess for movies that i think will be remembered throughout time. Even though this movie is extremely well done its another story about love, loss and time travel. It doesn't stand out as much to other people as it did to me i guess so -1 for that. Because everyone else doesn't realize there isn't another love story this well done without making you completely heartbroken first. This movie holds is own with all of them without putting you through that! so just enjoy a good movie."
"Seraphion","8","4","6","11 January 2015"," A great movie about time travel that actually teaches something about it
","The story really makes good use of its long two-hour duration and actually teaches something about the thing which until now seems to be impossible, time travel. The two acts that the movie is divided into actually tell two different kind of focus, where at the first act Tim is actually hard at accepting things and always does his best to rewind time and mend things, even to the tiniest bit of detail. But on the second act, the thing with his father teaches Tim to let go of his control and accept life as is and enjoy it. This movie doesn't concern with all those complex and complicated physics or philosophy surrounding time travel, thus making the movie feels as the lightest among all other time travel movies. What makes me like this movie even more is the tiniest bit of biblical reference Tim's Dad said to Tim. This makes him a great and exemplary character for not following the footsteps of his male bloodlines that fell to the traps of money and other worldly obsessions. The acting overall feels good, especially as the movie makes its way onto the second act where we see Bill Nighy's acting really supports Domnhall Gleeson in making the screenplay to feel more alive. Rachel McAdams adds nicely to the movie, but I think Bill Nighy's acting really steals the spotlight at the second act."

It has been by far the most touching story written by Richard Curtis and he has portrayed love on-screen with a very different, new and mesmerizing prospective. Rachel McAdams was once again perfectly suited for the role and played her part with perfection and heart but Domhnall Gleeson makes you live all sorts of emotions. The story is very different from other stories and the fantasy in it made it more wonderful to watch it. A different sort of drama. Well, I would say that LOVE is eternal and has different forms through which you can deluge to the ones you Love. A wonderful movie to watch in the Winters."

At first, the movie was fun. I loved the way how it put humor into the very unorthodox family of Tim. For me, this was something new in the Time-Travelling series wherein it's in his genes. <br/><br/>As the story progressed, I felt myself being drawn into it. I love how there would be scenes where it made you celebrate being a human. The quirks of the characters and whatnot. But towards, the end, my tears just flowed non-stop.<br/><br/>This is a film that said that sure time traveling is fun but you can't change what's written. If it's your time, it's your time. It was so bittersweet when Tim and his dad met for the last time. Even more so, when he decided to have another child. It made me realize that, though you want to cling so badly to the past, you can't, because you have to live not only for yourself but for others, too. <br/><br/>I could truly say that this movie touched me. Time is limited. You have to spend it with the people you love doing crazy things."

","This film is completely underrated. I joined IMDb to rate this movie because I think the message is so powerful. My mom had highly recommended this movie months ago and I only watched it because she was speaking so highly of it. As soon as I heard the word time travel I had no interest in seeing the film but trusting her I watched it anyway. As other reviewers have mentioned the common clichés of time travel movies are skipped over. I wish I had known this because I could have enjoyed the film even more instead of waiting to hate the movie and waiting to confirm that I hate all time travel movies. This movie brought me to sobbing tears in the best way possible. It leaves me thinking about my own life and crying now as I think back to some of the more powerful scenes in the movie. There are flaws in the time travel that made me feel a bit uneasy so be warned that if you like a flawless movie with a story that doesn't overlook a single detail you may be slightly frustrated. I won't reduce my rating though because I loved the movie so much."

"estebangonzalez10","7","4","6","10 January 2014"," Richard Curtis continues to push the boundaries of sentimentality
","""We're all traveling through time together, every day of our lives. All we can do is do our best to relish this remarkable ride.""<br/><br/>If there is someone who can get away with being too schmaltzy, generic, charming and sentimental it's Richard Curtis. It comes as no surprise here considering he's directed Love Actually, and wrote such rom-coms as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Notting Hill among others. He has a tendency of melting even the toughest hearts and no matter how prepared you think you are for his next film somehow he gets you again. Perhaps About Time is his most sentimental film and that could turn some people off, but I must say this isn't your typical romantic comedy. Half way through the film it turns into a completely different movie becoming one about family dynamics and enjoying the ordinary moments in life. Perhaps the reason why Curtis gets away with being so charming is that he creates a perfect balance in his stories and introduces comedic relief at the right moments. About Time is a flawed film, but you can probably say this about all his films. The thing a lot of people might have a problem with specifically in this one is the time traveling element which many may find a bit absurd, but it worked for me (at least it was much better than the other time traveling movie that Rachel McAdams starred in) and I think Curtis uses this element as a sort of parable to remind us of the importance of savoring each day. It may feel like a sermon at times, but it's one I don't mind being reminded of. Carpe Diem!<br/><br/>Tim (Domhnall Gleeson who you may recognize as Bill Weasley in the last two Harry Potter films) is a shy kid living with his parents (Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan) and lovable sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson). The morning of his 21st birthday his father shares with him a family secret: the men in their family can travel in time, but they can only do so to moments they personally have experienced. Tim decides to use this special ability to find love, because he really needs all the help he can get for it. Tim leaves his parents beautiful beachside estate in Cornwall for London in order to become a lawyer. He moves in with one of his father's friends, Harry (Tom Hollander), who's a struggling writer with a bad temper. In London Tim meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and the two fall for each other, but due to a time traveling incident that night is erased from Mary's memory and Tim has to find another way to win her back.<br/><br/>I feared this film would become another sort of 50 First Dates, but surprisingly it took an unexpected turn halfway through the film and becomes something else. It is not just a romantic comedy, it becomes a movie about family, love, and life where Tim learns a couple of valuable lessons along the way. McAdams and Gleeson shared great chemistry on screen, but the true standouts in this film were the supporting characters, especially Tim's father played by the wonderful Bill Nighy. He is great here once again, while Wilson, Duncan, and Hollander all are extremely funny and used for comedic relief. It's a relief from the schmaltzy sentimentality of the film. It's as if Curtis is admitting he's manipulated us way too much with all the emotional sentimentality and now it's time for a good laugh. If you don't find this film funny then you will probably find it way over the top with the sentimentality. It's not a film for everyone, but I had a good time and was charmed by the story."

","Good concept. The acting is fine. BUT, there are some issues.<br/><br/>For one, both leads are miscast. The male lead here needs to be charming or funny, and while he seems like a fine actor, he's not that charming or that funny. I also don't understand why they felt like Rachel McAdams was a good casting choice. There's not enough background information about her character, and to put it mildly, there is absolutely NO chemistry between the two leads in the film.<br/><br/>THe film reminded me of ""Mr. Nobody"" - only it wasn't nearly as good.<br/><br/>I like the point of the film - which is that it's actually better to appreciate the less-than-perfect moments of your life, have no regrets, but just takes so long to get to this. It's spoonfed to the audience in the last 5 minutes like the film did a bad job of expressing it, AND IT DID! I also didn't care for some of 'the rules of time travel' which seemed like they were written on the fly.<br/><br/>I went in with high expectations, but that's not the only reason that this fell flat. 7.8? THis was no better than the slightly above-average ""Delivery Man"" that I also watched last night.<br/><br/>THe bottom-line is that I just didn't find anything interesting about these characters - other than the ever-so-obvious ability to travel in time.

"snuffles75","4","22","52","19 August 2013"," Oh Dear - can I go back and see something else instead?
","I'll start this review by saying that I liked Blackadder, Four Weddings and A Funeral, Notting Hill and even Love Actually. So I knew what I was likely to get with a Richard Curtis film. <br/><br/>The first part of About Time, when Tim The Protagonist (Tim, it's a bit like Tim, innit?) was with his family, discovering what he can do with time travel was actually really quite good. A bit ""Richard Curtis By Numbers"", right down to the ditsy ""flower child"" sister, but fun nonetheless. The scene where Tim's Dad (who also has the same powers) describes how this works is actually one of the better scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>Then Tim moves to London where he becomes a lawyer. Lots of fun could be had with time travel and studying for exams, but somehow we don't have that - Tim becomes qualified enough to be in court, in wig and gown, in what appears to be a serious fraud trial, somehow without any work actually taking place. But that's nit-picking for a rom com. Another fun side character is introduced in the Grumpy Playwright - who, character-wise, bears a remarkable resemblance to Acting Banker from Notting Hill. <br/><br/>Then we are treated to an overlong ""getting to know you"" scene which takes place in an ""In The Dark"" restaurant - which means we the audience are left looking at a black screen with voice- over for what feels like forever. I am sure this is meant to be enchanting and touching, but actually I found it dull and boring, and the ""oh yay you're not ugly"" scene immediately afterwards just feels forced. <br/><br/>More jumping around time high-jinks, coupled with an over-long montage showing Tim and Mary falling in love, moving in together and so on, with a bad busking band playing in the background. It was difficult not to compare it to the passing-of-time montage in Notting Hill, which was much more effective - this just dragged on and the music was headache-inducing. During this sequence we also have a ridiculous strip tease from Mary - who declares that she will take off her clothing for Tim if he makes decisions about their upcoming wedding. It felt particularly gratuitous and completely unnecessary - it didn't even work as a comedy moment. <br/><br/>Tim and Mary have a child and it's all lovely...<br/><br/>Then the ditsy sister - who is very reminiscent of Scarlett from Four Weddings - ends up in trouble. Yay for Tim and his magic powers...but he discovers that by going back to the past to save his sister, he loses his daughter - who has magically become a son. A quick check with Tim's Dad and Tim learns a Very Important Lesson - if you travel back past the birth of your children, then the children can change. <br/><br/>So Tim jumps forward, changing his new son back to his old daughter, and leaving Ditsy Sister to her fate, although luckily it seems that a lifetime of domestic abuse can all be rectified if Mary stares at you very hard. Another child, and then the requisite death - Tim's Dad has cancer and Tim gets to discover that magic time travel skills don't save you from cancer - or maudlin Nick Cave songs being played at your funeral. <br/><br/>Mary decides to have a third child - and Tim decides to go back in time to see Dad again before Child Number 3 is born - he knows he can't go back after this without risking changing the new child. When he sees his dad, it's quite a touching scene - which Dad then ruins by trampling all over the Very Important Lesson - Tim and Dad go right back to when Tim himself was a child. <br/><br/>This is perhaps the most annoying aspect of the film - not that I was expecting any kind of sensible plot but at least Curtis could have stuck to his own time travel rules. <br/><br/>The film felt overlong - and entirely as if it was written for Hugh Grant. The tone and mannerisms and character of Tim were very similar to the characters Grant has played for Curtis - but of course, Grant is far too old now for this role. Everything felt like a pale imitation of other, better Curtis movies.<br/><br/>I genuinely can't recommend this film at all - a terrible shame."
"jimmy2","6","15","33","1 November 2013"," A light and forgettable film.
","There are a number of times while watching this film when I wondered what the point was. When it was finally spelled out to me, then I realized we've reached the end of the film. I find the best films have subtext that isn't spelled out to us or aimed to hit us on the head like a hammer. I find that the latter as a heavy-handed way of portraying a message or emotion, and that's what the powers that be decided this film to be, which is a shame.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the acting was awful. I believe the acting was, in a lot of scenes, heartfelt and sincere. That likely has more to do with their strength as actors than the actual script, however, which I thought was rather weak. Bill Nighy channels his Billy Mack character from ""Love, Actually"" (by the same director), this time as a father figure. Not much of a stretch for his considerable acting chops, but he manages to sell it nonetheless.<br/><br/>The whole affair is light and breezy. Not particularly memorable, which brings me back to my original point about the message being sledgehammered to the head. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that the film-goer would feel the same way I do, and decided to force the message in order to provide some sort of moral that is supposed to bring all this forgetful affair together and therefore make it memorable. The message itself, while commendable, is fairly underwhelming.<br/><br/>I had a somewhat pleasant experience watching this film, don't get me wrong. However, I have no desire to see this film again, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see it."

I was wrong, and how.<br/><br/>From the start he makes the bile rise in your stomach. There's a character called KitKat (""who is always bare-foot""); her family have Sunday lunch on the beach all year round (""no matter what the weather""); they even watch a film projected onto a rock on the beach, in the rain. <br/><br/>But things get much, much worse. Curtis basically recycles scenes and ideas from all his previous crimes (sorry, films). We get the eccentric older family member, the kooky friends, the cute and nondescript American girl wooed in a fantasy London, the births, a death and of course a ****ing wedding. Mawkish music on the soundtrack tells us when to be happy, when to be miserable. The cynicism of the project and the vapidity of its intentions would be unbelievable were it not for Curtis's previous form. <br/><br/>Do not see this film. Watch a Hitchcock, a Kubrick, a Wilder, something that is proper cinema. This is an abomination, a dreadful, lazy, meandering, actually quite nasty (how on earth did a film with numerous F-words get a 12 in Britain?), vomit-causing, stupid slice of celluloid which, if there was such a place as hell, would be shown there on a loop."

I think it's a movie that leaves you feeling very happy, and feeling happy for the characters. <br/><br/>The main thing I took away from this movie is that you should try to live each day trying to appreciate the small good things, even when stress or ordeals may upset you. Yes this sounds very generic, but it really does put perspective on how you should look at life. If you look at each day joyfully and appreciating the small moments, you'll have better days!"

","Sometimes you can tell a nice story, and you don't have to get so bogged down with the heave drama, but still draw a tear or two, and that is what the writers have done here. A sweet romantic movie with lots of fun, laughs, and twists to keep you paying attention. The time travel is handled very well, and you can easily see it as really happening, or just being something that helps this family cope with loss, by remembering things differently. However it is a very Enjoyable movie that will lift your spirits, and you may even want to watch it again to enjoy the finer details. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic comedies, or a little bit of fantasy. It's no Mimzy, but rather quite the Whimsy. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."

","On his 21st birthday, Tim's Dad lets him in on a secret - the male members of his family can travel back in time. Tim uses this ability over the years to try to undo bad things, sometimes making things worse in the process.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis writes and directs a romantic comedy which hangs from a sci-fi hook, although to call it a sci-fi movie (or even a time travel movie) would be grossly overstating the case. It is charming, constantly funny (though not necessarily belly-laugh funny), always interesting, it doesn't always go in the direction you expect (although it does mostly), and it is populated by characters who you are happy to spend time with.<br/><br/>Tim is played by Domhnall Gleeson as a nerd who arcs gracefully into a good but ordinary (except for his ability) man, Rachel McAdams (who I don't normally like) does well as love interest Mary, Bill Nighy steals the film as usual, and the rest of the support are all very good (Tom Hollander's acidic Harry is particularly good fun.<br/><br/>The story is solid but not exceptional, either as a romance, slice of life, or time travel. The script is, as one might expect from Curtis, frothy but with some meat on the bones, with real emotion and heart.<br/><br/>I liked this a lot."
"WildWayz","8","7","13","19 August 2013"," Wonderful story, brilliantly told!
","My wife and I managed to attend a free screening of this movie yesterday and we had no idea what it was about before hand. All I knew was what the synopsis said, which felt completely wrong when we watched it!<br/><br/>The story was written and directed by Richard Curtis, of Vicar of Dibley fame and contains a mixture of American and British actors (And Australian ;)). It is a romance with a time travel theme; being able to go back to a time in the past in order to re-live it. <br/><br/>What surprised us about the movie is that it doesn't go down 'cheap' routes; plots where other movies would have gone down ie ""oh no, I am going to cheat on my woman and go with my ex"" - which is really refreshing.<br/><br/>My wife described this movie like an onion; many layers of it - each one different. I would agree. Bill Nighly was brilliant as was Lindsay Duncan - very good couple together on screen. <br/><br/>The main actors/actresses were all very warming and the chemistry was fantastic; Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson were brilliant - you got a real sense of their relationship in the movie; from him being a bumbling fool (but harmless) to her being very charming and sweet.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend this movie as a 'date night' movie - or simply one that you can enjoy with your partner and come out feeling warm inside. Probably one of my movies of the year - which is saying something as I am more of an action person :)<br/><br/>Go see it. Take your partner. Your mother. Your sister. Your best friend or a complete stranger that you have kidnapped so you have someone to watch this movie with (ok, don't do that but you get my drift!) :)"

This kind of made the concept defunct.<br/><br/>From then onwards, we're treated to entirely predictable events as the dull humour quickly drops out of the film and it makes a stab at being something serious, failing to realise that most of the intelligent male audience dragged into it by women likely lost interest a long time ago.<br/><br/>What is probably most infuriating though, is the writer's inability to create any leading male who isn't a public schoolboy Woody Allen clone, and if a viewer closed his or her eyes, the lead was Hugh Grant right down to the exact amount of air sucked in during pauses of verbose retorts.<br/><br/>Before the end, I had to apologise for being unable to sit through this painful mess of a film and went to another room to do something more worthwhile... and can only recommend that others skip ahead to that stage rather than pressing Play on this disc at all."

The more I waited the more terrified I was, expecting all plot insofar to be a build-up for that one fatal blunder. Then it slowly downed on me that it wasn't going to happen - he was just a normal nice guy with maybe more common sense that most and he did smart but otherwise normal decent human things, and it worked for him perfectly.

"shawneofthedead","8","6","11","18 January 2014"," A tiny miracle of a film that's about so much more than time.
","Richard Curtis has been responsible - as a writer, director or both at once - for such beloved romantic comedies as Four Weddings And A Funeral, Notting Hill and Love Actually. It would seem to make perfect sense, then, for his newest film to be marketed in the same way: About Time, the new Richard Curtis rom-com featuring time travel! Never judge a film by its trailer or poster, though, as the saying goes, because there's an almost startling, heartbreaking depth to About Time, which slowly reveals itself to be a story about family and love that's only concerned in part with romance.<br/><br/>On his 21st birthday, awkward, gangly Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) is told by his dad (Bill Nighy) that the men in his family have a unique ability to travel in time: they can't kill Hitler or take a tour of Renaissance Europe but, by going into a dark space and clenching their fists, they can revisit moments in their own personal timelines. When Tim meets the sweet, beautiful Mary (Rachel McAdams), he resolves to do everything in his power - including go back in time - to win her heart.<br/><br/>That may sound like a bit of a kooky premise, but Curtis' execution of it - in his dual capacities as writer and director - is completely winning. In the moments when it's very much a rom-com, About Time is deliciously romantic and sweetly hilarious. There's an effervescent joy to Tim meeting Mary for the first time (again), just as the ways in which they fall - and stay - in love are close to magical. Curtis' films have always used music to great effect, and here he peppers the love story with songs that will move into your heart and stay there, like Ben Folds' The Luckiest and The Waterboys' How Long Will I Love You.<br/><br/>But About Time isn't just about a boy and a girl finding each other: it's also about what happens after that, when romance leads to a lifetime spent together, making memories and becoming a family. Tim discovers, to his horror, that his gift cannot shield him from all the low points in life: when he starts having more to lose, the costs of doubling back on his own timeline grow ever larger. It's a point made very effectively when Tim tries to save his beautifully quirky sister Kit-Kat (Lydia Wilson) from the heartbreak and horror that has derailed her life.<br/><br/>In many ways, this is Curtis' most personal film: it folds in life lessons and insights about death, loss, family, and treasuring what's extraordinary in even the most ordinary of lives. He seems to suggest that Tim's gift is more of a choice: it can be used in the flashiest of ways, unravelling lives and histories in the clench of a fist, or it can be used to savour all the little things that we take for granted, all the moments that slip by in the rush and bustle of a busy day. Tim's romance with Mary might be the selling point of the film, but it's really his tender, emotional relationship with his dad that will stay with audience members long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>If there's anything that doesn't quite work, it's Curtis' deceptively simple notion of time travel. Tim's gift is more plot device than plot point, but it still raises more than a few questions along the way. Does Tim have to re-live his entire life whenever he goes back in time? Why are only the men of the family given this odd, marvellous gift? Isn't there something faintly worrying about men who can completely control the shape and nature of their relationships with the ladies in their lives? About Time breezes swiftly past these concerns, but they lurk disquietingly within the film anyway.<br/><br/>Curtis' cast is an unmitigated marvel. Gleeson is a sweetheart, his bumbling warmth adding greatly to Tim's gentle appeal. McAdams shines brightly in a slightly undercooked role, leaving no room for doubt that men would brave the vagaries of time travel for a chance to see her smile. (It's fortunate that her second foray into time-crossed romance is so much more successful than the lamentable The Time Traveller's Wife.) Nighy, meanwhile, all long limbs and rumpled charm, is heartbreakingly lovely as Tim's dad: the father who patiently teaches his son about everything that matters in life and love.<br/><br/>A few months ago, Curtis announced his plans to retire as a director after About Time - this would allow him, he said, to take properly to heart the film's message about consciously choosing to enjoy one's life in all its quiet splendour. For fans of Curtis, it's not a complete loss, as he plans to focus on writing and producing and has, in any case, directed only three films in his career. But, on the strengths of the sweetly devastating, unexpectedly accomplished About Time, it's hard not to feel at least a small sense of loss in imagining what might otherwise have been."
"Horst_In_Translation","10","6","11","26 October 2013"," Deeply moving film with a message
","When I went into this movie, all I knew was that it has Rachel McAdams, Brendan Gleeson's son (who I knew from Harry Potter and Six Shooter) and time travel. As I'm usually not the greatest sci-fi fan, my expectations weren't too high I guess. When I left the theater 120 minutes later I was wowed by what I just witnessed. I really liked the way they split this film basically into two halves. The first is mostly romantic comedy. The main premise is initially rather odd as the lead character finds out from his dad that he has the ability to travel in time. And so he does for a while to correct certain mishaps that happened to him, mostly love-related ones and here and there also a favor to a friend. I won't go into detail what he decided to relive particularly, but it was all quite entertaining and never really dragged. How he needs to run away to make it happen, was always one of my favorite parts. McAdams is always nice to watch and she gives a solid performance here too. I read Zooey Deschanel was also an option for the part and I don't really like her, so I'm actually glad they went with McAdams, who has unusually dark hair here. There is also one particularly sweet sequence when he finally has a chance to get with the woman of his dreams and realizes she's not the one he wants, but McAdams' character is. Up to halfway into the film I'd maybe rate it a 7/10.<br/><br/>The second half, however, is where the film really delivers. The two are an item at this point, so there's more dramatic focus now, first on how their baby has changed (a very moving scene, especially when he sees the right one shortly afterward again) through time travel and then for quite a while on the relationship between the central character and his dad (excellently portrayed by Bill Nighy). Also more scenes on the main character's sister's crumbling life get included and how time travel can't solve these issues for her. Admittedly, these come short quality-wise compared to Nighy's, but only because Nighy nails his role so much. The relationship between him and his son is just so wonderful to watch, the table tennis (with letting the other win), the walk at the beach and the final meeting which is inevitably the last as Gleeson's character is about to become a dad once more. Eye-wetting stuff and I cried quite a bit for the last 45 minutes.<br/><br/>As I wrote earlier, I'm really not that big on the sci-fi genre in general, but it always seems to deliver for me when it's just a sub-plot/genre to the exploration of interpersonal relationships just like here or in ""Never Let Me Go"", another film I totally adore. ""About Time"" is a feel-good movie with serious undertone and some truly emotional highs. Also it teaches us to live every day in a way we would not want to relive it, even if we had the chance, because it was just so wonderful the first time. And we paid attention to all the beautiful details and made the most of it and wouldn't want to lose that day as we could hardly relive it in an equally great manner again because we made every minute count. The director, Richard Curtis, is also responsible for the beloved Mr. Bean and ""Love, actually..."" and I'm okay with both, but neither impressed me as much as this one here. To me, it's his masterpiece and finest work to date. It's a perfect example of how a smart story with lots of heart is more important than challenging characters or super-great performances, who couldn't even save the worst script. It is my second-favorite film of 2013 right now (behind ""Sein letztes Rennen"") and I very much recommend it and hope you'll have an equally great time watching this gem of a movie. Thank you for reading my review. I hope you enjoyed it and don't want to go into the nearest closet to go 10 minutes back in time and ""unread"" it."

","Richard Curtis, writer of successful comedy shows and films like Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, debuted as director with the alright Love Actually, and followed with the disappointing The Boat That Rocked, I hoped this would be third time lucky, he said it may be likely to be his last film as director. Basically on his 21st birthday Tim Lake (Black Mirror: Be Right Back star Domhnall Gleeson, Brendan's son) is told by his father (Bill Nighy) the family secret, all men throughout the family have had the ability to travel back in time, and following the instruction to go into a dark place he tries it out and sees it is true, he cannot change history, only moments in his own personal past. He wants to use his gift to help find true love, and later the following summer his sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) brings her friend Charlotte (Margot Robbie) to stay with the family, near the end of her time with them he decides to tell her his feelings for her, he is heartbroken when even changing what he does with time travel she does not feel the same for him. Tim decides later to go to London to become a lawyer, he moves in with struggling playwright, and acquaintance of his father, Harry (Tom Hollander), and later with his friend he meets Mary (The Time Traveller's Wife star Rachel McAdams) in darkness at a blind dating establishment, it is only outside that they see each other and feel mutual attraction, she gives him her number. Tim hears that Harry's opening night of his new play is a disaster as a lead actor forgot his lines, but travelling back in time he helps the actor and the play is a success, but later trying to call Mary the number is no longer on his phone, because going to the play means that he and her never met. Remembering her interest of Kate Moss he looks for her in an exhibition, and eventually using his time travel method he finds the right approach to say hello, but he is devastated to find she already has a boyfriend, they met the night after the play at a house party, so he travels back so that she and he never meet, and knowing she is bored he invites her for a dinner date with him. Tim and Mary have a good evening, and she is happy to have him walk her all the way home and invite him up to her place, and using his time travelling he is able to enjoy the night with her more than once, and they have many dates after and are very happy. She tells him that she is pregnant, which he is very surprised by, and despite another encounter with Charlotte he knows he loves Mary and proposes marriage to her, and they marry, and later have daughter Posy, and stay happily married through the passing years as he uses time travel to solve the minor problems and have a beneficial life. There is an incident on Posy's first birthday Kit Kat has a car crash following a row with her boyfriend Jimmy Kincade (Tom Hughes) who has caused nothing but trouble since meeting her at the New Year's Party he first time travelled back to, so he tries to stop her ever meeting him and stop the crash happening, but causing this change in history mean Posy will be another child, so he has to allow this crash to happen. Kit Kat eventually recovers in hospital and is back on the mend having split with the boyfriend, Tim and Mary have their second child, son Jeff, but then another tragedy strikes when Tim's Dad is diagnosed with terminal cancer, time travel cannot change this, he had been using his ability to time travel to spend more time with the family as he knew this for some time, he is ready to die. Tim travels back in time often to spend more time with his father while he was alive, then Mary says she wants another child, he knows that this means he will not be able to travel back and see his father any more, so he travels back one last time to see his Dad and tell him, but before going they travel back in time together to spend time on the beach as their younger selves. Tim takes the advice from his father to live every day twice, once normality to have all the stresses of a normal person, the second time knowing what to expect, change the smallest of things and embrace everything, but after having his third child, daughter Jo, Tim comes to realise it is is better to live every day like it was the last and enjoy life with Mary and the family like normal. Also starring Lindsay Duncan as Mum, Joshua McGuire as Rory, Vanessa Kirby as Joanna, Lisa Eichhorn as Jean, Mary's Mother, Tom Hughes as Jimmy Kincade, Richard Cordery as Uncle D and Mitchell Mullen as Fitz, Mary's Father. Gleeson gives a good performance as the young man using the ability to travel back in time to win the girl and connect with his father, McAdams is really beautiful and sweet as the girl the lead male marries and has children with, and Nighy is lovable as the bumbling but always reliable father, supporting cast members get their good moments as well. The story is both clever in the way it makes you laugh, feel affection and cry, and it is clever because it points everything in life we may take for granted, it is a sweet love story, it is a heartwarming father and son story, it is funny in the right places, and it is of course written and performed very well, it is a great romantic comedy science-fiction film. Very good!"

"bob the moo","Null","9","19","11 June 2014"," Not funny or smart enough to justify the sheer amount of sentiment it pours on
","When he turns 21, young Tim has ""the talk"" with his father – although in the case of his family, the father/son talk is actually to reveal that all the men in the family can travel in time, back to any moment in their own life. Told of the downsides of just chasing money or just never working, Tim continues his life but determined to make the most of his talent to try and make sure he has true love. It doesn't work out great at first but a chance meeting with Mary starts a journey of a lifetime.<br/><br/>There is a message at the end of this film that is essentially about living life as it comes and enjoying it for what it is – not necessarily everyone quitting to go and travel for the rest of their life (someone needs to work) but just enjoying the ride whatever that ride is. It is a commendable message but the irony of it is that it is being delivered to someone who has just not done that for the previous 2 hours. Of course going into the film I knew that this is a Richard Curtis rom-com, filled with the usual faces and of course doing the usual things, so there is an element of buyer beware, but I was curious about the time-travel angle.<br/><br/>Truth is that, outside of some plot points and basically the same jokes done over and over again, it really doesn't add much to what is essentially a film so sugary it will give you diabetes. The shame of it is that it does have nice ideas and themes in here but it never misses a chance to overdo it. So the soundtrack is full of easy Coldplay-esque rubbish, the narrator explains it all slowly so that the film doesn't need to be work, the relationships are all soft and cuddly, the characters are all totally fantasy people who only exist in Curtis' films and generally the whole thing is overdone and hugely sentimental. I would lie if I said that it didn't still work as such, but it really was hard work to stay close to it considering how much it pushed me away.<br/><br/>The cast match the tone of the film and I found Gleeson and McAdams to be overly cutesy and cuddly – not a rough edge on either of their characters or their performances. Nighy at least adds a bit of clout to the mostly empty emotion, while Hollander, Grant, Griffiths and a few others at least add a bit of grit or cleverness into the film. Mostly though the whole thing is so safe and smoothed that almost no character remains in it. Of course it is not awful – it is too professionally crafted for that, but what it is just didn't work for me. About Time taught me a lesson about time – that it shouldn't be used for films that I don't fancy much but might watch just because someone said it is ""alright""."

"robin-653","2","16","39","10 October 2013"," An anodyne romcom devoid of temporal paradox
","There are many contradictions and plot flaws with this film, but it would be possible to overlook these if we had even been presented with a remotely satisfying piece of cinema. At its start, the premise seems promising - a young man has the gift of travelling through time and undoing those awkward moments. Early scenes in the film are actually quite engaging and amusing and Bill Nighy lights up the screen. The problem here is that the time travel conceit sets up an expectation of a complex plot involving tortuous temporal paradoxes and moral dilemmas, but the film does none of this. The car accident scenario is the nearest the plot gets to the difficulty of rewriting history. Beyond this, the story descends into a an irritating tableau of how lovely posh people live lovely lives in lovely St John's Wood houses. Once they escape from that horrid bedsit, the lead characters wed, make babies and live in impossibly expensive houses. The tornado at the Cornwall wedding raised the tantalising possibility of the bride being hit by a falling tree, setting Domhnall Gleeson's character on a time-travel quest to prevent her death. But no. Instead the film-makers choose to rub our noses in their dreary middle-class bliss. It's all so nice, so twee, and so disassociated from time-travel. Possibly this is Curtis's blandest work to date. If you want to see a good, tense film about time-travel, go see Butterfly Effect. The only tension you get in this anodyne romcom is Rachel McAdams trying to decide which dress to put on for a dinner party (it seems to take her about 20 minutes). I only wish I had the gift of time-travel so that I could travel back to persuade myself not to buy tickets for this film in the first place."

","I have to admit I enjoyed this one; yes, they do make certain rules about time travel and then immediately break them, but that's not what the story is about. And yes, it is about well off white people, but again, if I wanted a film that was politically correct and socially aware I don't think I'd have Richard Curtis write it. No, this was pure escapism for me and I happily went along for the ride. Great performances all round, but the stand-out for me was Bill Nighy; he really nailed the part of the dad for me. I have to say I liked the soundtrack as well with many contemporary tunes littered along the way. So it made me laugh and I even shed a tear towards the end and there's not many films can do that. I admit I'm a bit of a sucker for the occasional Rom-Com and this one had just the right ingredients for me.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 8.2/10.<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

Even with the Time Travel it's believable.<br/><br/>Tim is played with style and depth, he starts to think early on about how best to use his new found talent, the way the scene at the National Theatre and after helps to develop him and produces quite a subtle turning point in the film. The Best Man's speech sequence coupled with the Weding in the rain shows how Tim isn't going to abuse his power, he just wants things to be right.<br/><br/>The cast is so right it's frightening, the play off each other so well, the photography is excellent and the writeing is Curtis at his best (even above his Black Adder work).<br/><br/>I can't praise this enough, see it I'm sure you'll never regret it."

","I was not sure how good this movie would be based on the preview, so I went in not expecting much. it starts off with a young man who obviously has lady issues and doesn't quite seem to know how to deal with women. After his father told him he had the ability to travel through time it really got me interested. After his unfortunate happenings with Charlotte, it seems he was out of luck to find a woman. He than moves to the city and meets Mary (Rachel Mcadams) and immediately falls for her. Some things happens and he ends up going back in time to help his friend out, not knowing his date with Mary would never happen. The movie really grabs you by seeing all the work he puts in for this girl and it's not your basic love story as it might seem, it's funny, and serious at the same time with an ending that will leave you in tears. Overall great movie I'm going to watch it again right now ."

","I am THAT girl ... the one who has a tough time suspending disbelief and just watching for the sheer enjoyment. My brain automatically goes ""Uh what? That couldn't possibly happen"" and then it comes up with 100 reasons why the movie is not feasible.<br/><br/>This time was no different. What WAS different was... I just didn't CARE. ***SPOILER*** At the end when Tim goes back with his dad, it really should have done his children in because the theory was that you couldn't go back to a time before your children were born because then it could mess up the whole deal. He would have had to walk, talk, speak exactly the same way they had originally done, which would be impossible. ***SPOILER OVER*** But by the end, I just didn't CARE anymore if the theory was sound. I loved those characters so much...I loved their relationships...their quirks, flaws & strengths. I just loved everything about them so I didn't care if it made sense. Without even meaning to, and for the first time in a very long time, a film made me suspend my disbelief and just WATCH admiringly. For that, it deserves 10*'s"
"dareent-amethyst","9","5","9","9 March 2014"," Best movie i have seen in months
","About time is a fantastic movie. It is a combination of drama, romance and comedy that is not cheesy at all. I could tell that this is going to be a nice movie after i saw the trailer, but instead of being just a mediocre nice movie, it turned out to be one of the best I've seen in months, probably even years. I decided to see about time merely for entertainment, I didn't expect it to be anything other than another cheesy but fun to watch love story. This movie will keep you sitting in your seat smiling and guessing. You think you know whats going to happen next but you actually don't. I enjoyed the plot, narration, characters, settings, basically every little thing about this movie. The story line is just flawless, i cant think of any way to make it better. The characters have this amazing chemistry between each other. What i love most about this movie is that it can somehow turn a fictional story into a story people could actually relate to and learn from. I laughed during the first half, cried during the second half, it was a pleasant movie experience. This movie taught me a lot about life in only two hours. I strongly advice everyone to go see this movie. It's a winner! oh and go see this movie for a date."
"brett-donald","9","5","9","25 February 2014"," Another Richard Curtis masterpiece
","How good is Richard Curtis? In my book, he is pure genius! He inspires me to be a better person.<br/><br/>His first masterpiece, Four Weddings and A Funeral, is a roller-coaster ride of comedy and tragedy, packed with outlandish characters and witty lines, but most of all, fun. His second masterpiece, Love Actually, is another magical roller-coaster, but with more emphasis on the theme than on the humour. About Time continues this progression, and it is not a comedy at all, but a wonderful, positive drama about humanity, family, and love; in particular, the love between a father and a son.<br/><br/>This is a thoroughly beautiful and intensely moving film. I cried my eyes out throughout the last ten minutes. I think it moved me so much partly because Tim, the lead character, faces many of the same life experiences and choices as I have, and learns lessons with which I can identify. The film is firmly grounded in reality, not fantasy, and how refreshing is that! And the plot is totally original, you can't guess what's about to happen.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is perfect in the leading role, and Bill Nighy is just so wonderfully honest in his role of Dad. The film belongs to these two. My only gripe is that Margot Robbie had such a small part - she is a damn firecracker!"
"eddie_baggins","7","5","9","13 February 2014"," A very enjoyable tale of life and love
","Sometimes a flawed and somewhat predictable movie can be enjoyed by the watcher due to its charm and inoffensive manner, Richard Curtis's time traveling love story About Time is one of those films, a film that provides enough laughs and heartfelt moments that only Scrooge himself could not find enjoyment in this tale.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson's very own Domhnall Gleeson gets his first big leading role here as our lovable ginger time traveling lawyer Tim and he does a fine job at being a lovable red haired version of Hugh Grant. Gleeson's chemistry with season rom-com veteran Rachel McAdams is made believable also with her slightly underused talents coming to the fore in most of their scenes and the eventual on screen romance plays out in a believable manner despite all the time traveling business occurring throughout. While this love story is a major part of About Time, Curtis has also positioned the film to be more than a man meets girl tale with a twist, and with this choice has made a film all the better for it.<br/><br/>Playing Tim's Dad is veteran British actor Bill Nighy, who with Gleeson gives the film another side that usual rom-coms would be hard pressed to have. It's within this relationship between time traveling father and son that the movie finds many relatable and confronting issues to deal with and by films end the audience's emotional investment has been well and truly earned thanks to it. In concerns to Curtis as a director, it's also a departure for the man who has not shown this side of himself as a director before but that's not to say the film lacks a few well-earned laughs and Curtis usual array of colorful supporting characters, which is evidenced in Tom Hollander's playwright Harry.<br/><br/>Coming in at roughly 2 hours About Time covers a lot of ground and in doing so it would be fair to say that the films first half pales in comparison to its much more concise and impactful second half, but as a whole it all comes together in such a way that it's hard to fully criticize. Watched with the right mindset About Time is the perfect movie for a night in and stepping stone for lead Gleeson to find his feet in the world of big budget tent pole movies.<br/><br/>3 and a half clenched fists out of 5"

","Look, I have watched a lot of good movies, which pretty much all of them ended with a disappointed moment. You didn't expect Jack Nicholson to get lobotomized in One Flew, Or, You didn't hope Matt Damon would be dead in Elysium, or... You didn't wish Lord of the rings would have to end like that.<br/><br/>I put no-so-much expectation to this movie when I started watching. I mean, really, this is one kind of movie that at the beginning, you understand it will be teaching you about the value of gratitude while showing the main actors getting his/her life messed up with his story *talking about clicks and Time traveler's wife*. But hell yeah... this movie is not.<br/><br/>I can say I was smiling a lot for every scene of this movie, and it kept going until the end. I was deeply-touched by the moment when Tim trying so hard to have the perfect closure to get into Mary, I was smiling to see a lot of family moments which Tim Shared with his dad, mom, sisters even with his daughters and son, And finally I was so relieved by how Tim and his family dealt with his father's death. It was so wise yet meaningful in a different way that will get you *at least me* feeling life can be really wonderful.<br/><br/>Yes, somehow this movie may be unrealistic one, but... hell, Hollywood should get their head back on to make this kind of movie. It really is a good entertainment!"
"knightkuyu","9","5","9","6 February 2014"," Thought provoking and emotional
","For a movie to be memorable to me it has to do one thing and one thing only, it has to make me talk to myself. This movie is not the most original thing ever done and a lot of what happens is a big slap in the face to cause and effect. Despite this, I loved it. I identified with the main character and the story, unlike many I watch nowadays, didn't seem rushed. It took its time and as a result felt emotionally impactful(I think I made up a word there). A lot of this is due to the excellent score but, I think, more is due to the excellent writing. Awkward conversations actually felt awkward and fatherly advice came out fatherly. The entire cast was amazing but Bill Nighy in particular has never been more likable. Will this movie be for everyone? Of course not. Did it make me debate character choices out loud with myself? Yes. Yes it did."
"harihar90","7","5","9","3 January 2014"," Not just a romcom.
","The initial 1:30 hrs was a pretty solid romantic comedy with a tinge of fantasy. If the movie had aimed for nothing more, it would still have been a decent addition to Curtis' filmography. A solid 6.5-7/10. But it is the last half an hour when the movie does indeed follow a different tread than typical romcoms and, at least for me personally, succeeded spectacularly. May be I am projecting my own emotions on those scenes (which beautifully depict a father-son relationship) for them to have the effect, but I do not consider that to be a flaw. Rather, it takes the sublime touch of a great artist to get people to do that, without the attempt seeming too on the nose or sappy.I think Curtis proves that he is one of those rare few who can achieve it."
"cultfilmfan","7","5","9","18 November 2013"," About Time
","The problem with About Time, is that it is not particularly a bad film, but at the same time it is not really a good one either. The film is purely and simply mediocre. The premise of the film sounded interesting enough with it's blend of romance/comedy and even a little bit of science fiction (if you really want to call it that), but I just felt that the film went nowhere with this material. In the right hands a story idea like this could have really been something wonderful if it was in the hands of say, Charlie Kaufman, or someone like that, but here the material loses steam and interest fast and I didn't feel the film used this interesting premise in any interesting ways. Events happen in the film where there is some sort of mishap, or embarrassment and so henceforth we go to the science fiction aspect of the film and changing the outcomes of many situations, but the problem is that the film used this plot device and gimmick too many times and it just never went anywhere and after awhile it never really seemed fresh, or original, but instead a film that has just one too many clichés and plot holes and it really did not feel like anything new, or breakthrough, but instead just a rehash of films that I have seen so many times before. I appreciated that writer/director Richard Curtis, tried to make us connect with these characters on the screen and giving us moments of which to laugh and cry, but again none of it really registered, or connected with me personally. I might have had a few laughs during the course of the film and at times it did hold my interest, but I just overall was not all that interested in how this film would end, or what would happen to these characters and the plot device/gimmick that was introduced into the story. At times the film almost felt a little emotionless as well. Things just seemed to drag on and it was never really all that interesting and at times, I do admit some of the emotion, or things going on, did feel a bit forced and the true emotional build up, or allowing us to care, or connect with these characters was never there. I have seen other Richard Curtis films before which I have liked, which was one of the reasons I chose to see About Time, but this I feel is one of his most underdeveloped films from a writing perspective because of how we never can connect to any one person, or event and just that none of it is all that interesting. I was hoping that like Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry's wonderful Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which did have a unique and original plot device and gimmick, but that film made us care and relate to the characters and situations more so than most films I have seen and was a film that always was fascinating and kept your interest and because of how personal and realistic it got, you could both identify with it and laugh and cry with it at the same time. The plot device there was not underused, but used in the right way and it ended up being one of the best films of the 2000's and one of the best films around period. I was hoping that writer/director Richard Curtis would have taken the same route with About Time, but unfortunately the end result was too flat. This isn't also to say that I hated About Time, because I didn't. There were times where I appreciated some of the humour in it and when the emotional content did not feel too forced, I felt that I did connect with it in some ways, but unfortunately those moments were too few and far between. I didn't like the film and I didn't hate it. I think that it is going to be one of those films which I will probably remember for a couple days and then as time goes by, I will forget most of what I saw on screen because it did not resonate, or connect with me as I wished it would have. I still like Richard Curtis and I would recommend viewers a lot of his other films whether written, or directed by him, like Love Actually, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, or my personal favourite, the made for television movie The Girl in the Café. All worth checking out. I wish he would have repeated some of the successful material in those films for About Time, but as it stands About Time, is neither good, or bad, but simply mediocre and nothing more."
"FilmMuscle","7","5","9","13 November 2013"," About Time for These Kind of Rom-Com's!
","Normally, I'd be quite hesitant to seeing a rom-com, but as any open- minded individual, the concept and charm granted the film potential based on the promotions and instantly intrigued me. About Time revolves around a socially awkward character, Tim, who discovers an incredibly useful and all-the-more manipulative secret that runs on the male side of his family. A father essentially entrusts his son with this valuable power that allows him to travel back into his past, which means the next time Tim ruins a relationship or mistakenly goes for a kiss only to be humiliated thereafter, it's right to the nearest closet or compact room to fix the issue and reverse his horrible decisions. <br/><br/>Moreover, the film happened to surprise me in that it carried much more heart and depth than your standard romantic comedy, and it rather flourishes in its style of authenticity. Progressively, we're either met with extremely relatable or wholly plausible situations that induce laughter or provoke various emotions deep inside that tough personality of yours (speaking from a male's perspective). Its strongly apparent sense of genuineness emphasizes the likability of the characters with Bill Nighy being a clear favorite, retaining that charisma and lovability that all have already come to associate him with. Domhnall Gleeson undeniably delivers a terrific performance, suffused by numerous subtle facial expressions, gestures, and stuttered speech that effectively composes his insecure nature. <br/><br/>Furthermore, even though the final message of the film could be deemed cheesy, it's totally executed in a convincing manner in part by- again- its sincere essence. By the time the feature has wrapped up, the audience will be in tears. During its development, they'll be infatuated by its subject matter. In such fashion, About Time is remarkably capable of taking you on a wavy journey that consists of sadness at times and pure excitement or comedy in others. A wide variety of people will be sighted throughout its span, some veritably abhorrent and others utterly sympathetic, and it's this distinctiveness that comprises a realistic picture- something that's absolutely necessitated in a movie that deals with the kind of themes prevalent here. <br/><br/>With that being said, the flick's length certainly becomes problematic as it nears the conclusion; its last thirty minutes or so noticeably drag out, and we encounter an unexpected scene after another. Just when we believe that we're witnessing the last point for its thematic material, we shift to a fresh setting and an additional quandary. Actually, it reminds me of Return of the King's last act which seems to present us with multiple extra scenes following several lengthy black screens. When the picture eventually finishes at the mark it sought to, it feels as if the whole matter could've been wrapped up in a more concise method without dozens of further complications as a means of elucidation. <br/><br/>In sum, the idea of time travel is adeptly utilized in addition to the countless laughs to be had and the highly entertaining plot overall. About Time is undoubtedly one of the best rom-com's in recent years, and I hope to see more of this kind from Hollywood instead of the artificial half-assed stories, infested with detestable and debauched characters, they produce nowadays."
"yris2002","7","5","9","9 November 2013"," A sweet and feel-good romantic comedy-drama
","The picture is definitely a feel-good picture, one of those which make you think: ""I really needed it"". The idea of travelling in time is not that original, and could therefore be dangerous to use it for the umpteenth time, on the contrary the strong feelings of sweetness and tenderness which pervade it make it pleasant to see and enjoy, never sounding trite or boring. The cast is great, and help create the feel-good atmosphere, which never abandons the viewer also when some dramatic moments are to be faced, since always supported by a positive feeling towards life and familiar bonds. There are some new faces together with some older faces of British cinema, working together very empathetically , on the background of a breathtaking Cornwall which is by itself worth the ticket."
"xamtaro","9","5","9","17 October 2013"," Rare romance with a deeper moral message
","Have you ever looked back on your life and thought ""what could I have done differently""? Have you ever wished you could re-live a wonderful moment over and over again? Well young Tim Lake has the ability to travel back in time, same as his father, and his grandfather. Tim is not exactly the handsomest of men; he is an awkward, shy and slightly introverted character. Yet with these new found abilities he tries to make life better for himself and those he care about by altering little events in his past. This brings him to Mary, the woman of his dreams. When a change in the past almost erases their relationship, Tim holds back on using time travel unless only for the most important things. As his relationship with Mary grows from friends to family, Tim slowly learns that sometimes one has to let go of the past in order to fully embrace the present and work toward the future.<br/><br/>ABOUT TIME is possibly one of the few romance movies that subvert the ""typical"" romance tropes. It is not overly sappy or awkward like the Asian ones, but neither is it over sexualised or shallow as Hollywood ones. It is an earnest little fairy tale that, refreshingly, frames a love relationship into the eventual outcome of a happy marriage and a family (unlike many which just ends with the couple in bed together). This earnestness is helped by well written characters, particularly Tim who goes through a complete coming of age tale that many can relate to.<br/><br/>Starting from a socially inept teen with aspirations of dating the hottest girl in town, Tim soon realises that looks is not everything and settles for Mary, a woman who truly complements his character. We follow him as he grows into a confident adult and a loving father. Actor Domhall Gleason shares perfect chemistry with Rachael McAdam's Mary, making their relationship all the more ""real"". But the true breakout character is Tim's elderly yet charismatic father played by Bill Nighly who we find out has used his time travel abilities to relive precious moments in life, knowing that his life is soon coming to an end.<br/><br/>Yes the movie does skimp pass the less desirable aspects of relationship to present a very idealistic image of romance: the squabbles, the arguments, they are never present. Family life too skims over the baby crying at midnight, the smelly diaper changes, adapting one's lifestyle around the child etc. But hey, fairy tale is fairy tale, and the movie would be three times the length if one were to go into the specifics of relationship trials and family tribulations. <br/><br/>ABOUT TIME's only flaw is how it trips over its very own concept. At the very onset, two simple rules are set down about time travel. 1) He can't travel forward in time 2) Travelling to a time before the birth of a child will alter who that child is. Yet Tim travels back and forth in time multiple occasions, and travelling past the birth of his child only altered his child the first time. Subsequent time travels, including one back to Tim's childhood, did not cause such changes. Any newbie to science fiction can see how WRONG the whole time travel gimmick works. Does he physically travel back in time? If so, why does he not meet his past self. Does his mind travel back in time and inhabit his past body? This is true for the first half of the film where he decides to travel back to help out a friend instead of going on a date. But later on, he seems to be in many places at once when he travels to the past, being able to do what he did and do what he wanted to do. <br/><br/>The easiest way to deal with this is to not take the time travel aspect literally. Instead, it is merely a metaphor for a strong human tendency to revisit our past and relive precious moments.ABOUT TIME brings up many life lessons. If we change who we were, we would never be who we are. If we change what happened to us, no matter how embarrassing or how negative, we would never be where we are today. All things, good and bad, happen for a reason and that reason may not seem clear at first. Sometimes something bad has to happen for someone to learn a lesson and change for the better.<br/><br/>So there is no point trying to change the past. One should only cherish the present, for it is a gift. Take joy in the little things, settle the negatives and live it in such a way that in the future, one would never have the desire to change his past."

This lovely film from the writer/director, Richard Curtis, of Four Weddings and Notting Hill, is a delight. Its funny, thought-provoking and touching. While Domhnall is not ""leading man"" handsome or arresting, he does a fine job. McAdams, very beautiful, does wonderfully well as his love interest. Other cast members, including Nighy, Lydia Wilson, and the rest, do great work as well. Praise should go forth to the creators of the costumes, sets, and cinematography as well as a deep bow to Curtis for his, once again, extraordinary vision. The setting in Cornwall is strikingly gorgeous, seaside and fetching to the point of EVERYONE longing to go there at once. Have you, as a romcom fan, been feeling neglected, like me?

"jadepietro","7","7","15","12 November 2013"," Passing Time
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>That tried and true formula about time travel is working overtime in About Time. a pleasing but slight little comedy. Just how many films have successfully taken this plot device and made it fresh and appealing. Not many. (Midnight in Paris, Back to the Future, Twelve Monkeys, Big, Time After Time, and The Terminator come to mind.) However, the number of movies which take that gimmick to hackneyed and overdone results seem endless. (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Time Traveler's Wife, The Philadelphia Experiment, Premonition, Kate and Leopold, 17 Again, The Adjustment Bureau, The Lake House, The Butterfly Effect, Frequency, Somewhere in Time, and The Final Countdown, all misfires that still boggle my mind.) <br/><br/>With About Time, many moviegoers will find this latest version of time hopping delightful, even romantic. I found it to be an innocuous trifle, a diverting enough two hours of amusement. The film has its charm, mostly due to its likable cast, but it follows that overused ""what if"" time-changing formula and rarely pushes its own limits. It stay safely within the lines and never wants to journey outside the box, at least until its conclusion. <br/><br/>The simple story follows the familiar road map of time travel ala Groundhog Day, another pleasant comedy with the same theme in mind. Tim is without a love connection, a misfit on the dating scene. After a father-son discussion on his 21st birthday, he suddenly learns that he can change what has happened in his own life to his advantage. His past mistakes can now be rectified and his future looks more promising with this newly acquired power. Although he cannot change history, he can relive those awkward moments and at least somewhat control his own destiny and finally get a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Domnhall Gleeson plays Tim and he is fine in this role. It's not a real stretch, but he makes his character believable even with this unbelievable set-up. Rachel McAdams is his love interest, Mary, and this actress also generates some innovation to a clichéd role. There is a strong chemistry between the two young actors which helps to elevate the predictability of the film. Even better is Bill Nighy as Tim's wise father. Nighy brings subtlety and warmth to his patriarch role and his acting skills are precise and spot-on.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis wrote and directed this movie. His specialty seems to be the romantic comedy genre (the annoying Bridget Jones' Diary, the better Notting Hill and Love Actually films, and the superb Four Weddings and a Funeral ) and this film is one of his minor efforts. This time, his script starts off way too cute and takes awhile to build any real emotion or tension. The film is almost stuck in its own self-imposed time warp, afraid to jump from sentimental sit- com situations to honest adult issues. It's not until the midpoint of the film that About Time finally deals with familial complications that directly affect the relationship between Tim and Mary, and only then, does the film begin to become compelling. (Still, as with other films of this genre, this film falls prey to the illogic of time travel and its proliferation of selective changes and their lack of repercussions that never mesh with the character's sense of reality.)<br/><br/>Perhaps if Curtis had spent more time and more initial re-writings with his screenplay, About Time would have become a more memorable love story.

","The premise of the film - every male member of a nauseatingly happy family has the ability to go back in time... by going into a wardrobe, thinking of the time they want to go back to and... clenching their fists.<br/><br/>This requires a suspension of belief of course as physics tells us this is rather silly.<br/><br/>Our narrator and central character is told this by the man who claims to be his father. I say ""claims"" because Tim is ginger haired and no-one else in his family is. This is never explored in the film.<br/><br/>The restrictions of the time travelling are explained by his father to let us all know the parameters of the film/plot. He can't go further back than his own birth and he shouldn't go chasing after money because his uncle Fred did and it didn't make him happy.<br/><br/>There is no philosophical discussion about possibly intervening to prevent disasters such as 9/11 or warn people of coming Tsunamis.<br/><br/>Our Tim decides he will use his magic power to find love.<br/><br/>What follows is the usual formulaic clap-trap found in most other films Richard Curtis has been involved in, such as Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral.<br/><br/>It is set in Britain - a Britain aimed at an American audience where everyone has a nice clear and quaint accent, is a tiny bit eccentric and drinks tea.<br/><br/>He falls for, surprise, surprise, an American girl. They have the most vomit inducing, perfect happy little relationship anyone has ever had. The second hour of the film is just pure tediousness. They never row, get sick or have money troubles. Our Tim does not use his power to sleep with lots of girls and go back and then not do.<br/><br/>There is a mysterious uncle who has a touch of Alzheimer's. We perhaps expect this to be a sub-plot and his condition has been caused by going back in time too much. This is never delved into though and he just seems to be there for humour.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of the film is failure to fully explore the consequences of going back in time would have. For example he goes back together with his father to when he was a boy. By doing so he would have condemned himself to have to follow the exact same course of his life as he had previously, knowing for the next twenty years every single event that would happen both to him and in the world. It is not explained how, for example, he dealt with being a child whilst having the memories of having had intimate relationships with women. We just see him strolling along the beach with his dad and are left to believe that somehow his life followed the same pattern as before.<br/><br/>Groundhog day this ain't. One to give a miss."

","I don't even know what to write about the logistics of the time travel aspect as it doesn't make sense and they know it. Time travel really isn't the point so why bother dissecting it. Anyway time travel is used only as plot device to toy with your emotions. But actually what it truly does is remove any drama that the main couple will get together. Time travel solves everything in his relationship with her. Except that this movie dragged on forever. I lost count how many times I thought that it could end. (Maybe I was hoping more than anything.) Richard Curtis maybe a great screenwriter, but he certainly knows nothing about directing. I am glad that he proclaimed that he wasn't directing after this. Does he think anyone cares? The pacing is so meandering with different sub-plots that then were very quickly solved with time travel. I also want to mention that for long periods of time, time travel is not used even when (I think) it should have been. It is too boring to go into details, just trust me. The major theme of the movie is not wasting each moment of your life (which is kind of ironic) with time travel used as a means of exploring that idea. Here is the problem: time travel is only used so he can manipulate the women of his dreams into falling in love with him. This makes their relationship unreal because while he maybe in love with her, she is only in love with the make believe version of him. The much better sub plot or co-main plot is the time traveling father and son relationship. Mr Curtis should have focused mainly on their relationship as it had a real emotional payoff at the end. This leads into what I thought of the acting. Rachel McAdams was completely wasted. (By the way can screenwriters find a different occupation other than lawyer, play write or book editor.) She and Domhnall had zero chemistry. ZERO! (Plus what was the deal with all the Kate Moss references? Just terrible.) The opening scene of them together worked, but only because the scene was entirely in the dark. Domhnall did start to grow into the role, but only in the scenes with his father. Bill Nighy was good and really stole the show from the leads. The rest of the cast was your typical poorly written rom-com family members, especially the Uncle. Nothing they did was interesting or the least bit funny. Kit Kat actually showed some interest in the beginning before falling victim to a time travel plot story line. I will say that the music in this movie was really above average so great job Nick Laird-Clowes. In conclusion: Mr Curtis wasted the unique time travel element and Rachel McAdams. Two unforgivable sins. Stay away!"

","Without doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Storyline - banal bordering on silly. Every character totally miscast. Please Richard quit while you're ahead and spare us anymore of this twaddle. I loved Four Weddings and Notting Hill. We watch Love Actually every Christmas. Doom all Gleeson is not Hugh Grant - struggling to grasp the concept that this guy is actually a professional actor. Has to be related to someone close to Richard Curtis. Honestly a caterpillar's hips have more talent and charisma. If you want to watch a film about time travel I recommend any of the Narnia films. This is sad, insipid nonsense about people who don't inhabit this planet in any shape or form. Finally, in your next film why not just call Bill Nighy - Bill Nighy. He is incapable of playing anybody but himself. Avoid this movie at all costs. So I've clenched my fists in a dark room and gone back in time to edit this review. Dohmnall Gleeson is the son of Brendan Gleeson -established actor etc. That explains all. He's actor because his Dad is. Difference - his Dad is but he ain't!!!

","None of the romantic situations seem at all genuine Give a stranger at a gallery your full address? Sure! Ask your girlfriend to eat dinner alone so you can dine with a guy you've already turned down once? Why not? Propose marriage to your girlfriend when she's half-asleep, even though you could easily wait until morning? Great idea! <br/><br/>None of this would ever happen. I know it's a romantic comedy and these things are built on whimsy - but it's extremely difficult to identify with likable characters if you feel like nothing they ever experience would occur outside of a movie It's too cosily scripted from minute one, and fantasy should entail dreaming about things that could actually happen, not imagining a whole new alternate reality! <br/><br/>If there are flaws with the romance, then it makes the family stuff harder to take seriously, too, since the problem is with the root, and not the branch...

I barely found proper arguments. Most of those reviews (I cite literally) mention the word ""hateful"", ""disgraceful"", ""crap"", ""very boring"", ""worst movie of all time"" and so on. But so far, most if not all of these reviews fall to give a proper (IF ANY) argument to support their opinion. Might it be a matter of hatre to sensitiviness or life meanings what brings this portion of the population so much into this unexplicable hate?. Who knows.<br/><br/>This piece of little art is sensitive, comprehensive, not cheesy at all (at all) and surely, not SciFi-like at all, despite of its argument basis. It is not even a proper romantic love story, because as a matter of fact although it plays with the love relationship of the main characters, it extends it so much, so much, and talks about other forms of love (such as paternal love) some might experience, that at times it might become overwhelmin.<br/><br/>Wonderful movie, and a must see.

His decision to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend turns out not to be as easy as you might think.<br/><br/>'About Time' is a tale, very-well told. A wonderful film in all respects. Curtis's Screenplay justifies a fascinating concept, by converting it into A Gem of a film. Its mushy, emotional & moralistic. Its got everything a neat Romantic-Comedy should offer. Curtis's Direction, on the other-hand, is top-notch. His work as a Writer & Director, both, is extremely commendable. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are fine. Music by Nick Laird-Clowes is superb.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Domhnall Gleeson delivers a sensitive performance in the central role. Rachel McAdams is adorable.

","You've already read what the story is about so I wont bore you with the details.. I'll go straight to the point, the music! This is an awesome comedy romance story but what intrigued me the most was the music (have actually been playing most of the songs over and over on my phone since). The music includes pop, soft rock, r&b, soul from people like the killers, sexsmith, winehouse, T.A.T.U coming at just the right moments in the movie. A few of the songs have actually been redone with an 'about time' version (incl the theme song) and the result is very good! The music i think is what brings out the 'moments' in this movie that have resulted in Curtis' work ending up being awesome.. Take the funny 'el-mondo' song that Tim decides would be the main song for his wedding (dint think Mary would agree to it but alas..!) So watch the movie, listen to the music and some of it might actually end up growing on you.."

It's a comedy/drama that revolves around the relationship between a father and son.

"lordinlmaldonado","9","3","5","15 November 2013"," Wonderfully surprise!
","Went into the movies with low expectations. At most I was going to have a laugh here and there and then go home ready to forget this movie and think about what I'll watch next week. Could not have been more wrong! It blew me away. What started as a another formulaic rom-com quickly into a highly witty and extremely funny story. It then shift into a very deep and inspirational gear, without losing the first 2 elements. The story is surprising giving that the core is not really the developing romance between the character of Tim and Mary, but is in the fact the relationship between Tim and his father. The scenes with Bill Nighy and Domhall where nothing short of witty, charming and moving. It does have its plot holes involving the whole time travel thing but they are irrelevant to the soul of the story (unless you're a SciFi nut, in which case in you're the wrong movie). If you're someone looking for a film experience, then About Time is a must-see. 2 hours of laughing, awe, and moving feelings. Ultimately it just hit home."
"moviescoundrel","8","3","5","13 November 2013"," Worth the travel
","A pretty enjoyable ride. The time travel thing is an interesting plot device and isn't really overused or over explained. When Tim is told by his time traveling father that he too has inherited the ability to travel back in time to a scenario in which he was present and possibly change the effect on things he is at first thrilled at the possibility. After a couple of times gone sour though, he realizes it's not as easy or as useful as he thought, although a bit entertaining for the audience.<br/><br/>After using mostly his wit, uncharismatic personality, and specific details from the past he is able to nail down the girl he is interested in. He doesn't use his gift for a while, or see his dad for a while, which I think was a weakness in the movie. The director goes back to the well for the emotions at the end of the film with Tim's father, and I just thought this relationship could've been built up a bit more throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The relationship with Tim (Gleeson) and Mary (McAdams) moves pretty fast. It has sentimental, sweet moments, but it's just okay. Same as the supporting cast, and music. It's all just alright. Once Tim and Mary have kids, it gets a little more serious and sentimental, and it's interesting. The end of the film does get a bit moving with the whole life, death, and time travel thing. It's entertaining, and worth watching, but for a movie from the creators of ""Notting Hill"" and ""Love Actually"", it's not on the same level as those. ""Notting Hill"" had few characters, but they all shone, and the writing, dialogue, music, characters, etc. were on a whole different level than this film."
"Hellmant","8","4","8","13 November 2013"," Not just another bad chick-flick!
","'ABOUT TIME': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Writer-director Richard Curtis (who wrote and directed the critically acclaimed hits 'LOVE ACTUALLY' and 'PIRATE RADIO' as well as wrote or co-wrote other British romcoms like 'FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL' and 'BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY') helmed this 'time travel romantic comedy-drama'. It stars Domhnall Gleeson (who's most famous for playing Bill Weasley in the last two 'HARRY POTTER' films) as a 21-year-old lawyer in training who discovers he can time travel and uses his gift to get a girlfriend. Rachel McAdams co-stars as the number one object of his affection and Bill Nighy plays his time travelling dad. The film is as much a father-son tale as it is a romance but that didn't keep the theater I saw it in from being filled with 90% female viewers. As far as romcoms go it's pretty good but that's to be expected from Curtis.<br/><br/>Gleeson plays Tim, who is 21-years-old when his father (Nighy) tells him their big family secret; that the males in the family can time travel. He explains that they can only go back in time and they can't change history. Tim decides to use his special abilities to win over a woman. He first tries it on his sister's friend (Margot Robbie), who stays with his family one summer, but learns that his gift can't make someone fall in love with him. Then, when he moves to London to study as a lawyer, he meets Mary (McAdams) and the two immediately hit it off. As he continually time travels though (to try and fix things in their relationship and his relationships with others) he keeps complicating things and making them worse as well as better.<br/><br/>I last saw McAdams as a gorgeous and evil femme fatale in the Brian De Palma thriller 'PASSION' and she was fantastic in it. She used to be one of my favorite actresses but she's done so many bad romantic comedies (and other crap like that) that she's kind of lost my interest. So it was great to see her doing something completely different and good in 'PASSION'. Here she's doing another romcom, as the standard cute and sweet leading female 'love interest' role, but she's great at it too. She's the heart of the film and really drives the viewer's involvement in the story. Gleeson is a good and likable lead as well and Curtis's script (although flawed) and directing are brilliant. It is another romantic comedy but it also has a sci-fi fantasy twist and was in the hands of a good director. McAdams shines in the movie and everyone else in it is more than adequate as well. It's emotionally moving and definitely worth seeing; not just another bad chick-flick!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0"
"aharmas","9","4","8","8 November 2013"," Smart, Entertaining, Funny, and Touching
","Richard Curtis understands romance! It's been almost two decades since he wrote his masterpiece: ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", a loving examination of how quirky looking for happiness could be, yet it was old fashioned, real, and very good. He goes behind the camera this time with his own script. This only means another winner.<br/><br/>There are some liberties taken with the concept of time in the movie, but it's interesting to see how through Tim, we are able to live our fantasies: the opportunity to have a second chance and being able to correct a few of our mistakes.<br/><br/>The most winning part of the project is the casting, with every single performer giving winning performances. The most loving portrayal comes from McAdams, glowing, sweet, and lovely, with one of the most fantastic smiles I have seen in a recent film. Watching her react to Tim's initial moves is a joy, and her wedding scene is a romantic classic.<br/><br/>The film, like ""Weddings"" manages to feel real and balance moments of happiness with a few incident of grief. The best is to see the realization that these people act like real people and are representing our dreams, giving us an opportunity to at least experience some of their joy.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"Amari-Sali","8","4","8","3 November 2013"," Despite being advertised as a romantic movie, the real focus is on the relationship between brother and sister, as well as son and dad.
","For me, the main draw was seeing ""From the creator of Love Actually"" on the poster, as well as seeing Bill Nighy and Rachel McAdams' name attached. Add on that this seemed like a cute sci-fi love story and I was even more entranced. However, upon seeing the film I must say I do feel a bit tricked.<br/><br/>Cast and Story<br/><br/>The film focuses on a young man named Tim (played by Domhnall Gleeson) who comes off as a sort of loser when we meet him. However, upon his father, played by Bill Nighy, revealing that the men in their family can time travel, things look like they could pick up. However, upon moving to London, things don't seem to be going well for him as he lives with his father's friend Harry (played by Tom Hollander) who is a brilliant writer but also a butt hole, and sadly his little sister Kit Kat (played by Lydia Wilson) isn't doing so well either. <br/><br/>But, what Tim does have going for him is a job as a lawyer, but it is at a firm which doesn't respect him or partner Rory (played by Joshua McGuire), who is such a sweetheart, all that much. However, thanks to his old friend Jay (played by Will Merrick – known for generation 3 of Skins, to me anyway), he meets the love of his life: Mary (played by Rachel McAdams). <br/><br/>Which leads to a rather sped up relationship which quickly establishes them as a couple as the movie moves on to the true focus: Tim's family; specifically Nighy as the eccentric dad, and little sis Kit Kat who is the equally eccentric daughter. For most of the movie, Mary is more so there to support Tim as he deals with the troubles of a sister who isn't really prepared for adulthood, and a father whose mortality is becoming more apparent thus leading to a movie which may not be romantic, but can be a tearjerker.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>Which, to me, saved this movie. The family ties are written so well that you can forgive being duped. Kit Kat, is lovable, zany, and truly hard to not root for during her struggles. Then, with Nighy's character, he makes you think of your relationship with your own father and you almost feel like Tim, reminiscing over the good times, trying to avoid the bad, and trying to relive those moments which soon will only exist in your own memories. <br/><br/>Also, I felt the use of Tim, and Nighy's character, use of their time travel ability was used just right. Often times it was used to fix an awkward or unsatisfying moment which was usually built into a joke. However, there were also times when the reason wasn't selfish in the sense where they are trying to make the situation perfect. Tim uses the gift to help Harry's play be perfect and Nighy's character, who is simply known as dad, uses it to make the perfect toast for his son's wedding. Then there is one time, specifically, is which there isn't a minor sacrifice, but something which would lead to major changed in Tim's life by changing the past, and I have to say I appreciated that, at least once, they really showed that this power had the ability to flip his life and they made Tim make a hard decision about using said power.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>Which leads to my sole criticism, which is the romantic movie sold in the trailer is weak. For one, the romance is rushed and afterwards, it is easy not to care. For one, once he gets the information he needs to be with Mary, there is no challenge anymore. Basically, he screws up a few times to establish the relationship, and once it is done, it is done. There is no real build, trials or tribulations, or anything which makes you fall in love with them. In a way, it feels so fated that it is like they were an established couple from the beginning. But, this isn't to say they aren't cute together and that Rachel McAdams loses that sort of Meg Ryan in the 90s appeal i.e. she seems like she can be anyone's love interest and make it work. If anything, the problem is that you are forced to adapt to a story you weren't sold on watching for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>Though I felt a bit like I was sold on one thing and given something else, I didn't feel jipped. For, while I didn't get a cute romantic movie featuring Rachel McAdams, I did get to see a beautifully done movie about family ties. One which truly made me cry; laugh a dozen, or so, times; and made me think that they could have easily advertised the movie for what it is and still have gotten my money. This is why I think it is worth watching. You may not get a strong romance between man and woman, but you still do see a cute and fun setup to it, and the relationship isn't bad, just not the focal point you expect it to be. However, to compensate, the film does a good job at showing the interdependency of family, from wanting to be the dad your own dad wasn't; loving a family member no matter how odd, or off, they are; and being there for someone when they are drowning and are seemingly at the point where perhaps fighting for air doesn't seem worth the effort anymore. This film gives you a true look at the importance of family and how that importance, and love, extends to extended family."

Three of them are films that I watch when I need to get out of a funk. I would imagine a lot of people have films that do that for them, classics like It's a Wonderful Life or Forrest Gump for instance, but for me they are Harold and Maude, Breaking Away, and the much less well known but very special film - Let It Ride. About time is now number 4 on the list. I really don't see this as much as a romantic comedy as a film about learning to wake up and smell the roses. I left the theater so full of thoughts about how to approach life and what is important. See this film when you are feeling like life just sucks cause you will leave the theater feeling just the opposite. <br/><br/>I will add this film to my very small DVD collection when it is released.

"3xHCCH","7","4","8","10 September 2013"," As Much About Family As It Was About Romance
","On New Year's Day of his 21st year, Tim Lake (Domhall Gleeson) learns from his Dad (Bill Nighy) that the men in their family can travel back in time to specific moments in their lives. There will be rules that cannot be violated lest past events altered will give rise to completely different outcomes. Naturally kind-hearted Tim uses this power to get himself a girlfriend, among other good-intentioned deeds in conscious ""Groundhog Day"" scenarios. <br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson (whom we will recognize as one of the elder Weasley brothers in the Harry Potter series) felt really sincere as dorky Tim, and his relationship with insecure Mary, sweetly played by Rachel McAdams (already the heroine of love stories like ""The Notebook"" and ""The Time Traveller's Wife""), was very disarming indeed. They were an ideal couple here. The scenes on how he successfully got Mary to be his girlfriend and their very different wedding and the reception were their best scenes together. OK, Gleeson may look a bit younger than McAdams, but you still can't deny that their positive chemistry was truly palpable.<br/><br/>However despite this being marketed as a romantic love story, I felt more emotionally-connected with the scenes played between Tim and his quirky family, especially Tim and his Dad. There may have been scenes which violate the very rules upon which their time-traveling is based, but the sentiment was so poignant I decided to just overlook them.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the Cornwall coastal panorama and the streets of London were very charming. The perfectly-timed entrance of selected pop oldies and ethereal new songs adds to the emotional atmosphere created by the situations.<br/><br/>Some scenes that I felt went a little too long, contributing to a running time of more than two hours. The whole side plot about beautiful Charlotte (Margot Robbie) could have been shortened, as well as that endless scene where Mary was choosing a dress to wear to an event. <br/><br/>Overall though, this is a very pleasant British love story by Richard Curtis, who wrote and directed classics like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Notting Hill"" and ""Love Actually."" Again like his other films, ""About Time"" is also about love and family, but this one had an actual fantasy element in play, and that unique magical touch adds to the fun and the romance of the story."
"A_Different_Drummer","7","6","14","10 January 2014"," Astonishingly uneven, overlong, McAdams is Subdued .... but still worth seeing
","Old reviewer's secret. It's called the watch test. If during the film you have to look at your watch to see how much time is left, the film loses points appropriately. The test (once mentioned by the late Roger Ebert) works because it requires so many subliminal and subconscious cues to generate the behavior. And this film fails the watch test. Most viewers will check their watch (or phone or mobile device) more than once. Because it is overlong. And because there are weak points in the script. Which is itself astonishing because this is a Richard Curtis film (Love Actually and many more hits) and if Richard Curtis were to sire a horse, you would expect that horse to win the Derby. Now before you dismiss this review, I encourage you to do a test -- watch the Time Travelers Wife which by coincidence is also about time travel and also stars McAdams. And you will see what I am getting at. So, that aside, what we have here is a very strong film that purports to be about a sci fi theme but really is about family, and brothers and sisters, and friends and relations, and mothers and children. The time travel is really incidental, as the ending makes clear. Also, Curtis who also directed seems to have gone out of his way to tone down McAdams (who usually ""glows"" in her films, see RED EYE). This is accomplished by McAdams herself (who does an excellent job of keeping her charisma in check) and by giving her a haircut that makes her look like a squirrel. Good film, but you can't avoid the feeling it could have been better."

","You know those websites which can automatically write a politician's speech or a covering letter when all they have to go on is a few multiple choice options you have selected? Well who knew Richard Curtis had found the equivalent for romantic ""comedies"". <br/><br/>The options Richard Curtis selected; at random one can only presume unless his 2 year old niece danced on his keyboard while he was doing something unbelievably humanitarian in order to make up for the millions of hours of people's time that he will have wasted with this film; were, and in no particular order: <br/><br/>1. ""a film that audiences will forget that they are watching while they are watching it""<br/><br/>I forgot to mention that he only had one option to select and that of the millions at his disposal he selected what we can now safely call ""the Richard Curtis"" option. <br/><br/>All Hollywood and English speaking production companies have a ""richard curtis"" button somewhere on each of their keyboards. Unfortunately this button is so overused that the ink has dissolved leaving what looks like a mini space bar. <br/><br/>If you find yourself laughing, crying or in any way involved with the characters in this film, please step away from your computer and any household appliances in your vicinity before you do yourself an injury.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being a bit harsh I mean let's face it, how many films out of 10 these days do we actually enjoy?

"darren-121-731341","4","2","3","13 July 2019"," Could have been better.
","This film follows along the same formulaic avenues of other Curtis films, and seemingly has lots of characters that have been tweaked a little and dropped in here. The natty, slightly crazy Sister for example.<br/><br/>And therein lies the problem, the film is devoid of imagination. Set in a chocolate box version of London, it basically follows an all too familiar path his films have taken in the past; you know that at some point the characters will have to face a dark moment, the trouble is that even at the darkest point, it's just not that dark and not that interesting. And so this does impact even more on the story and alas makes the film seem really long, when it should hurtle through. Some scenes have no value at all and you wonder why they are there, you could have cut half an hour off this and it would have been a lot better.<br/><br/>The acting overall is excellent and the cast, as you would expect top class, with Bill Nighy the stand out for me, just great to watch. And of course the two leads have very good chemistry, it's really hard to believe this is Hux from the terrible Last Jedi, well done Ruin Johnson.<br/><br/>There were opportunities here to be riskier with the characters to take chances and create more situations of genuine jeopardy and raise the stakes.
Alas the characters pretty much run according to type, and the story carries on it's all to unadventurous stroll through life.<br/><br/>I feel the genius of Four Weddings (apart from Andie Mcdowell) was that it had some great little comedy moments, moments you never forget, coupled with the sadness of death and the characters reaction to this. Sadly this film never goes to those heights, when it really should have.<br/><br/>So, really a missed opportunity."

"hylianfrenchfry","8","2","3","7 June 2018"," Cute romance movie
","I absolutely adore this movie. Although some parts are a little unrealistic (which should be expected since its a movie with time travel), it's still a great story. 
Rachel McAdams is perfect for any romantic comedy movie. I thought Domhnall Gleeson was very charming and quirky. Although he is very attractive, he definitely is not the typical handsome guy you seen in most romance movies, which I think adds to his charm. Margot Robbie is beautiful and flawless as usual. I think it would have been difficult for most guys to turn her down, so props to Tim.
The plot is mainly about love, but it also focuses on family, life, and death.

They start creating expectatives in the viewer, when I saw it, I was thinking ""great, this movie is about time traveling"". Sadly, at the end they put this ability in second term. What we can rescue from this movie is the message. They send an incredible moral about life and to make the viewer understand it, they show us how the charactersÂ´s life change through the years, happy and sad moments that almost everyone experience."

"mistoppi","9","2","3","19 March 2017"," Brilliant and touching
","While I was at the rental store with my friend, we would've probably been there forever if she hadn't just decided on the fifth film for me. She chose About Time and promised me it was really good. I was sceptical, as I often am when someone else chooses a film for me to watch. And now that this movie is after, I know at least one friend whose taste I can trust.<br/><br/>I liked the plot almost instantly. Usually I'm not fond of any love related plots, and by that I mean how the main character knew he wanted to find love. Still it was clear that wasn't the only thing he was searching for. Moving to London he wanted to find his place, his future, and that was something many of us can relate to. Finding love just happened along the way, tho it was a bit frustrating to watch. How dumb can you be, travelling back in time without realising then you never met the girl? And why did he keep trying to find her? Sure, they are great together, but still it seemed a bit bothersome. <br/><br/>One of the nicest scenes in this movie - and there are a lot - was the one in the dark restaurant where neither the characters nor the audience can see. It was amazing to see how well Tim and Mary clicked, even though they didn't even see each other. Because of that the first sight of Mary was so special. <br/><br/>These kind of romantic movies seem to have the same structure, so I kept waiting for something tremendously bad to happen, like some misunderstand which would lead to awful things that would eventually turn out to be good and all that. But About Time's structure is different. Time isn't simple, and the events in Tim's life are just that - they are life. They are normal things, and his life is relatively normal apart from the time travelling thing. It's really nice, and it's very beautiful. <br/><br/>About Time is a very beautiful, funny and touching movie. It's amazing, and I'm really glad my friend chose it for me."
"Amyy-xo","8","2","3","30 November 2016"," A touching movie about how short and precious life is.
","I started this movie knowing the basic plot and that it would star Rachel McAdams. I didn't really see her as one of my favourite actresses until now. I saw her in the cast and knew I was going to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Tim's awkward and clumsiness bounces between cringeworthy and endearing. The music of the time is nostalgic even though 2013 was only a few years ago, it feels like forever. Maybe because I don't listen to music much anymore and it's a throwback to when I did.<br/><br/>The moral of the movie is that time is short. Try to live every day without worry and noticing all the sweet victories. The little things. You can only do this day once. Make it count. Make your interactions with the people in your life/ people you meet, mean something because this day could your or their last.<br/><br/>It was a really nice movie. Touching, it made me feel all of the emotions (except anger) but it didn't make me cry. Just the right amount of feelings, it was great. I'd watch it again. It's one of those movies that make you want a family, even though I don't want kids."

"tedari","9","2","3","26 October 2016"," This movie did two things most movies don't
","This movie did two things completely right that most movies don't.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of time travel movies. <br/><br/>Usually, I sit gritting my teeth at the sheer audacity of the writers as they attempt to suspend my disbelief to the point that I would have to just accept anything they throw at me. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, time travel is a sticky subject that is so hard to get right, but so beautiful to watch and immerse yourself in when it succeeds.<br/><br/>About time got it right. This is the first of two things it does very well.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, this treasure of a tale does not try to blind you with science, nor use you as some instant stooge to work its lame magic tricks. Instead, it comes right out with the plot at a very early stage when the amazing Bill Nighy just outright tells his son that he can time travel, and that's that. <br/><br/>Sure, this is ludicrous in its own right, but it's done in such a playful and self-aware way, that you can't help but chuckle and go along for the ride. <br/><br/>I loved the idea that there are rules to this incredibly simple method of time travel. Never forwards, only backwards; and the true dangers of what might happen are laid bare in a very intelligent and heartfelt way. <br/><br/>The second thing that it did well was the theme. The subtle message that we receive at the end of this movie can be found in every book on mindfulness, Buddhism, religion, self-help book, and basically anywhere else where someone claims to know the meaning of true happiness. <br/><br/>In a movie about time travel, you would expect there to be many selfish attempts to attain wealth, fame, and sex (although there is one scene where this is used to great effect). About time, however, doesn't bash you over the head with the clichÃ© boy-talk idea of what time travel is for. It approaches it in a mature, and yet intriguing way where on occasion you are unsure where the path will lead, but when you arrive you realise you probably should have trusted the main character a little more. <br/><br/>I won't reveal what the theme was or how it affects those who witness it on quite a deep level, but I will say that you will have heard it before from someone, and thought 'well everyone knows that', but we just forget, every time that is how we should be living our lives. <br/><br/>There are parts where the plot could have used more work and the movie seemed to stagnate. The sub-plot with the protagonist's sister, for instance, was a little stale and I didn't really feel as sorry for her as the writers wanted me to. I was also not really conflicted at all throughout the plot to the degree where I was squirming in my seat, or really gulping for fear of the unknown. <br/><br/>These are not major criticisms, though, the movie played it safe and I was a happy observer. I felt the tone was soft and fluffy, the characters were animated and interesting: my favourite has to be the uncle who I felt stole the show whenever he had screen time, great character.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hour run time, and I would definitely do it again with close friends just to show them what a gem it is and discuss what they felt about the interwoven message."

If I wanted real life I would look in the garbage bags under the kerb. It is done with just enough humour and without any soppy drivel. The warm intelligent script, editing and filming, developing characterization, unpredictable story, - and yes accents - are just so right. OK there shades of Groundhog day - but what story doesn't beg steal or borrow? It aims to address all the various roles that a man hopes to go through in life; being a son, falling in love, being a husband, dad, brother, work mate, friend... without being overtly sentimental. It was 'about time' that somebody made a romcom for men! The interacting of Bill Nighy & Domhnall Gleeson is a joy. Richard Curtis is the king of this genre, and I really feel that he will be very hard pressed to top this."

","I am not really into the kind of film which is full of 'Love Actually' themes but 'About Time' caught me unawares and I was drawn into the easy story line. On the surface there is no great difficulty in understanding this film - it's about love: love between a man and woman; love within the family; love of a father for his son. Quite often films are full of danger, violence and bad language - where the F-word appears in every sentence. This is not like that. There is sex, but it is beautiful, awkward, funny and passionate. The acting is good because it is life-like. This film says: this is what life can be...and it is easy to see how this could be so. There are great philosophical themes too. What could happen if one is able to travel back through time and undo one's faults and mistakes. I like this film very much. It made me laugh at my own stupidity and cry because I loved my dad, who is now dead. I could quite easily see myself putting it in my Desert Island list of films to save from the waves."

","I watched this movie a few years ago and loved it. I walked in my classroom and my students were watching it and I insisted that it be transferred to my usb so I could watch it again. My friend came to visit me for Christmas and we went through several OK films and then I suggested we watch this one again. I'm glad I did. He enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>This film evoked emotion on so many levels for me. The feeling of falling in love. The desire to be able to go back and change certain moments, however how small, is something we can all relate to. I have to say, I REALLY like Domhnall G. There is something so innocent and charming about him and I'd put his narration voice right on Mt. Rushmore next to James Earl Jones and Morgan Freeman in regards to making the audience FEEL. Whoever wrote the lines he released from his mouth during his narration has a soul and it;s evident. I have always been a fan of Rachel McAdams and in spite of her ridic haircut in the beginning, I'd say she was equally charming but not as cute as she was in Wedding Crashers.<br/><br/>There were so many things that worked for me, but none more so than the relationship between father and son. I was reminded of my dad and the things we'd do together. The last 20 minutes of the film resulted in the juiciest of eyeballs for me, especially when they went for that one last walk and DG was a kid. Touching stuff. My friend remarked at the end...""That was good"" and a day or so later told me that after watching the film, he knew it was time to go home. He lives in Shanghai and had made the decision to move back home to the USA after having taught overseas since 2008. This is my favorite film in the last decade or so, since Before Sunset/Sunrise."

","The main character in this story has the ability to travel in time to any moment of his life. Not caring about his ability of traveling back in his own life, this movie is only a romantic movie to me. The casting is a very important part in any movie, this movie got 10/10 in casting, from the not good looking guy to the weird uncle. The logic of the story is perfectly described, except for one little thing that you will find it in the goofs. The story made the character as well as his father use this ability as an advantage to find his love, but it did not secure him from life difficulties. The time traveling makes the movie so beautifully romantic, but the story structure still teach you a life lesson in many directions such as work, love and family issues. This movie is definitely one of the top romantic movies, that does not goes into fiction."

It was advertised as a movie about boy loves a girl and the girl doesn't know he exists. That movie you've seen a million times. Upon watching this film I was utterly astonished it could be so badly represented. It was funny and poignant in a way that was honest. It feels sincere like a handwritten letter. There is so much more to this movie than just the clichÃ©. If you take the time to watch this film you will not regret it. It's quirky but just enough. It finds a lovely balance between comedy and drama. It is not really about time travel, it's about life. It's about the important lessons everyone learns along the way. Each person's choices are unique as are the paths they take through life. This film shows you one man's choices and the path he makes for himself."

It was well written and plotted though there did seem to be one or two plot holes at times. Richard Curtis seems to be still at the top of his game as a writer and now he directs with the same sure touch. I had read poor reviews of this movie and avoided watching it for some time. I have to ignore reviews in the future and make my own decision."
"chuckwheel","10","2","3","12 August 2014"," Seriously underrated
","I've watched this film 4 times now, and every time it gets better. The writing is amazingly tight, and it is an incredibly well put together film. If you liked Notting Hill and Love Actually, then you should not miss this one. The premise seems a little goofy at first, but if you let that distract you then you've missed the point. It's about life and love and what you can and can't do to make them better. It also has some perfectly scripted jokes. Acting is superb all round.<br/><br/>If it didn't quite work for you the first time, I seriously suggest you watch it a couple more times. There are very few movies that reward repeat viewings so well. The Underground montage, the greatest wedding sequence ever and the final walk on the beach get me every time."
"thelethalgod","10","2","3","8 August 2014"," This movie has to be one of my favorites of all time.
","This movie is a must see. It has everything for everyone both the main characters are absolutely brilliant. This movie is by far the greatest love story ever. About Time makes your cry, laugh, and smile. I mean this movie has to be good considering this is the first review I have ever written on a movie. Best movie of 2013 by far maybe even the best movie ever. I have seen a lot of love stories but none that can compete with this one. But I mean come on anything that is romantic that includes Rachel McAdams is going to be good she makes you fall in love with her in every movie she makes (Besides mean girls I hated her) and Domhnall Gleeson is just as amazing in this film as Rachel they both make an absolutely adorable pair."
"azzthom","8","2","3","26 July 2014"," The RomCom comes of age
","Richard Curtis' most recent offering is, on the face of it, familiar ground. It appears to be a romantic comedy about a charming middle class boy and the girl of his dreams. But this time, there's rather more to it than that.<br/><br/>When Tim turns 21, he learns that he has the power to travel in time but only back to moments within his own life. He decides to use his ability to get himself a girlfriend. Which he does, although he has to meet the girl of his dreams (Mary) several times, and they fall in nice middle class love. This may seem like the usual Curtis formula but it really isn't. <br/><br/>Firstly, the central relationship is not between Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mary (Rachel McAdams). It's between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy).<br/><br/>Secondly, the film is about more than love. It's about family, friends, life, choices, consequences, responsibility and several other themes. And love.<br/><br/>Thirdly, there is a depth, a heart and a soul to this film that is rare in the genre. It stays with you in a way that romantic comedies, in my experience, just don't. Ever.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a subtlety to the film that isn't present in Curtis' earlier work. The mawkish depths that romantic comedies are rather prone to are largely avoided here. Which is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>The excellent cast are well served by the sharpest and wittiest script that Curtis has produced to date. The bittersweet taste is present as expected, but it doesn't define the film. Here, the bittersweetness actually adds something to the film's flavour. <br/><br/>To sum up, this is Richard Curtis most mature effort so far. I've enjoyed his earlier work - they were fine examples of romantic comedy. 'About Time' is more than that. It's a fine example of a film."

","There are few films that you instantly know will stay with you forever, this is certainly one. <br/><br/>I have to confess that at times I found the upper middle class, West Country, liberal setting a little troubling. But maybe that says more about my own prejudices than anything else. No Mr Curtis, not all our lives are like that. Without this, the movie would have scored a perfect 10. <br/><br/>Exquisite direction, understated acting and a razor sharp script combine to leave the viewer feeling more alive than they have probably ever felt before. This is what cinema is really about. If, as the credits roll at the end of this movie, you do not feel moved and privileged to live in an age when art can be this good, then something is wrong with your wiring. Do your soul a favour and watch this movie....and then watch it again the next day just to savour the wonderful moments it contains."

I know what it is like because I think it is the most important thing in life. You need to make the best possible effort because you do not have a second chance and it's always too late if you need to repeat actions.

Not meant bad to anyone, not meant good to others, it's just the way things are. <br/><br/>People are meant to be different, and are also meant to experience things in different ways. That's the true beauty of life anyway.

That is also the beauty of life. Choice...<br/><br/>One thing needed to say though! People should evaluate movies a bit different. Because there isn't often enough we get to see quality in films. This isn't the best movie out there, no. But it sure is one of the best in my humble opinion, mainly for the fact it dangles with notions that most people care for, and it does them in a creative, joyful manner that exhumes respect to the viewer, and travels us to good and bad places at the same time with a relaxing manner.<br/><br/>Loved the soundtrack, and the cinematography, but more even so, I loved the way the story is being told.<br/><br/>A must watch if you haven't."

The time traveling thing is not the thing that does this movie extraordinary, it's the moments the characters live, it's about the beauty on seeing things completely different from today life we live, especially in America were time seems like a luxury. We are loosing the beauty of life and this movie is about seeing it, embracing it just the way it's, be loved and love with all your heart all the persons that are important to you.

Not the most often used idea for a romcom, but nonetheless an interesting choice.<br/><br/>This movie definitely is not without its flaws. There are some parts which lack attention to detail regarding the time travel part and sometimes you expect something and are left wondering where the movie will go next when things don't go as you expect them. However, it is a very enjoyable film, with some exciting twists and a good moral about life.

","This film tells the story of a young man who is able to travel back in time. He embarks on the mission to make his life perfect by finding a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Though the main character is a guy, it still is a romantic film that is aimed at women. The story is about finding happiness, and what you would give up for happiness caused by a certain outcome. It's almost like ""The Notebook"" plus ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" combined, and as Rachel Mcadams is in all three, there's much danger of her being typecast. Or cast only Rachel in time travelling films or don't make the film! Back to the film itself, I think it's a story about an ordinary guy with extraordinary abilities. His realisation at the end is quite good, and it wasn't the ending I was expecting. Though there are many plot holes, just like many other time travel stories, it's still an enjoyable film."

Thoroughly impressed by the way the film kept my interest throughout its entirety, with plenty of 'oh my' moments.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","3","8 March 2014"," Best time-altering film since 'Groundhog Day'
","Time travel is one of the more hit-or-miss story conceits in film; it's certain to get people's attention, but almost as certain to expose the film to a barrage of criticism related to logic and the butterfly effect. In the hands of filmmaker Richard Curtis, however, today's finest purveyor of charming little films (""Love, Actually,"" ""Pirate Radio"" among other notable writing credits), time travel gets personal.<br/><br/>Whereas so many movies use time travel for exploitative comedic purposes (""Hot Tub Time Machine""), ""About Time"" more accurately represents what someone would actually use time travel for in their personal life. Time travel doesn't completely take hold of the story; it's simply the key player in main character Tim's (Domhnall Gleeson) quest for romance.<br/><br/>Like the best of us, Tim has a penchant for fudging things up the first time. So when his father (Billy Nighy) reveals the men in their family can time travel to different points throughout their lifetime (except the yet-lived future), he takes advantage of correcting a number of social missteps, such as kissing a girl a New Year's Eve party. When the jaw- dropping gorgeous Charlotte (Margot Robbie) stays at their Cornwall home for the summer, Tim soon learns that time travel only goes so far in swaying someone's feelings. He moves to London to pursue law in the fall, where he endeavors to at last find a girlfriend, and he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams). <br/><br/>If it doesn't sound like ""About Time"" has a compelling plot, that's because it doesn't. Yet it doesn't suck either. That's how brilliant a writer Curtis is, slapping dumb-looking smiles and movie-watchers' faces with clever dialogue, humorous scenarios and compelling romance. McAdams, unquestionably one of the best the romance genre has ever seen, runs away with this material, which she simply couldn't do in films such as, quite appropriately, ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" Gleeson also fits perfectly with Curtis' style; he's humorous, awkward and charming all at the same time.<br/><br/>Unlike many who watch this film will be lead to believe, the movie is not about Tim's pursuit of Mary. It's not a two-hour version of the sequence in ""Groundhog Day"" in which Bill Murray's Phil Connors attempts to use ""time travel"" to perfectly woo Andie MacDowell's Rita through a series of corrected screw-ups. The narrative scope of ""About Time"" is much larger in terms of chronology, spanning the entirety of Tim's young adulthood. In fact, three- quarters of the way in, it's not even about Tim and Mary's romance at all.<br/><br/>Eventually, ""About Time"" becomes about the challenges of living life, enduring the bad and appreciating the good, and what the ability to time travel would really teach us about living day to day and treasuring the present. An expected theme and conclusion indeed, but this final section gets a little long and tiresome without any riveting conflict. Still, Curtis has crafted characters we connect with strongly enough to hold up this last leg of his film.<br/><br/>All that said, it's easy to poke holes in the logic of the time travel in ""About Time,"" but the concept makes enough sense that it's not too distracting and you can still enjoy the characters, the romance and the lessons learned. Curtis might not be one of the greatest filmmakers working, but he understands what it takes to elevate a romantic comedy from the rest of the cheesy pack, and that takes tremendous skill.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I usually don't write reviews, but I noticed some persons bashing this movie. This movie is not perfect, non is. But, I'll tell you what it is. <br/><br/>1. It's funny, it has lots of moments that you can identify to, embarrassing moments, the troubles of being rejected, it's been shown in such a way that you can see the silliness of it all. I guess one of the many lessons in this movie is to learn to laugh at ourselves. <br/><br/>2. It has tear inducing drama, how sometimes we can't let go of those we love, how to cope with family issues. How love and acceptance are key factors in our relationship with our partners and family. How big is the love for our children.<br/><br/>3. It has a great story line with the Time Travel, the actors make this movie so believable, you even believe they can actually do it. This part to me was of self discovery, learning to appreciate life, the little things, our family, our friends. That we have the control to make our days better just by being grateful and see the beauty in everything. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie that'll leave you thinking for days after seeing it, and if you DO see it, take it for what it is, bask in it, put yourself in their places, and you'll thoroughly enjoy it. In the end all you have to ask yourself is, what would you do if you could go back in time?"

A lot to say for just a film, but only films like this can trigger such a response, well done Mr Curtis and well done for making me think. The way in which he takes everyday scenarios and wishes and turns the age old phrase ""if only I could turn back time"" into a reality makes this film what it is, it offers new ways round situations you may find yourself in and offers alternative routes to life's big decisions like having a baby or getting married, I have never thought so much about life after watching this film and I have to say I am not an easyily manipulatable person! But this film has changed my outlook on the little things in life and how they can just disappear instantly. I can only expect good responses for this film as cinematically....

Confusing, and i guess not throughly though, unless someone can explain me these situations, would appreciate it.. <br/><br/>It is not a true story, just a fantasy like romantic movie, where everything looks perfect and going well... The objective is to send a message, and it does, in a sense (although I think it could've been better)... It not a bad try, on the contrary a GREAT one!! So leave your critic thoughts and go for this journey openly, accept it and appreciate it...

","About Time is a film directed by Richard Curtis, and stars Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy. The story centres around Gleeson's character Tim, who at the age of 21, is told by his father that all men in their family can travel back in time. Instead of looking for knowledge or wealth with his new found power, he uses it to advance his pretty well abysmal love life. <br/><br/>Now, like so many, I had next to no info on what this was about. I had ""Time travel, love story, certainly not sappy"", and for me, that sounded pretty good. When I sat down to watch this though, I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. This film really captured me from the word go with it's hilarious script and fantastic main actor, and I'm not ashamed of saying it. <br/><br/>The performances are all top-notch. Domhnall Gleeson works his role perfectly, as a shy but charming young British man. He's ridiculously relatable, and his character feels incredibly genuine. Rachel McAdams also gives a stellar performance, and she is really adorable in this film. Call me strange or whatnot, I don't care, because I found her incredibly cute! The rest of the ensemble is wonderful, with special mentions to Bill Nighy, who plays dad, and gives a very emotional performance, and Tom Hollander, who gives an absolutely hilarious performance as Harry, a writer who is incredibly self-centred. All in all, wonderful film on the performance level.<br/><br/>This is certainly not your average Rom-Com, in which you can predict every aspect possible. It makes some twists and turns which you certainly can't see coming, and ultimately, the route it takes is a route not commonly seen in romantic films. Curtis doesn't try to clog up the film with tremendously silly, clichéd issues within the relationship, as so many romantic films do. It just takes you on a ride that so many relationships undertake. Ultimately, it feels like a real relationship, except this time with time travel! And whilst I'm on the topic of time travel, I believe they used that aspect incredibly well. They didn't use it at every opportunity possible, and in a nice twist, the actually used time travel for teaching us lessons, to accept everyday as it comes, to anticipate the next and to not live in the past. Ultimately, on a sentimental level, About Time delivers a lot.<br/><br/>In conclusion, About Time is by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen, period. It's free flowing, smart and incredibly charming, and it begs for repeat viewings. Richard Curtis has nailed it out of the park here, and I'm sure I'll be raving about this film all into the future.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Very inviting, witty, charming and overall, excellent.<br/><br/>About Time caters to all audience and that fact alone is very hard to find in films nowadays. The element of the film showing that this is going to be your typical rom-com while you are glued to your screens and when you are just about ready to accept that this is your ""all is well that ends well rom-com"" it punches you in the face and you find yourself drenched in tears and having a hard time inhaling through your nose.<br/><br/>The limited foreshadowing of the plot-twist has became an essential part of the film to its success and beauty. It is the trait that all movie-goers are very hungry to see. The ""I did not see that coming at all!"" moment when you are inside a theater or on your living room, was perfectly delivered by the film. It is obvious that this has been a product of a long and pain-staking task of developing a story that will not only attract people because of the trailer that they will see in-between other movies, but the audience will be lured by other people saying and telling them how good it was and by the reviews it received.<br/><br/>Richard Curtis and company has picked the right set of talents to go with the wonderful story About Time has to offer the viewers. It brought justice to its rich and flavorful story-line by partnering it with an ensemble of ""role-perfect"" actors.<br/><br/>It is the true manifestation of, ""Something beautiful will only come once in a while.""<br/><br/>Bravo! 10/10"

She doesn't pull out ""A Notebook"" but gives just what the script asked from her. Gleeson might be too orange to have a huge female fan base but he more than makes up for it with his performance.He and Bill Nighy shows how an ideal father-son relationship should be like. The script was so beautiful that it quickly got rid of the usual absurdity of a time- travel movie. Also what it does best is give relevance to even the smallest of characters, when you'll finish watching no one will seem irrelevant. <br/><br/>A movie with no hype, no expectations which is why it does so well.It'll surely leave a smile on your face when you're over with it."

","First of all I want say that i really enjoyed this movie, ever since i saw the movie Love Actually, it is always a treat to see Bill Nighy and i have to say he really brings this movie up a notch. Many people who don't like this movie give it a lot of critic for it not giving a lot of explanation and complexity with the time travel aspect of the movie. However this was never the point, this is a simple fun romantic movie full with emotions. If your expecting plot twists and complex story lines go watch the Memento's or Inception's. About time is a movie which aims to show how beautiful life is and how we should take advantage of every day. The acting in this movie i also thought was great, i had never seen/noticed the lead actor Domhnall Gleeson but thought he was great a perfect likable awkward British type of actor. And the relationships made through out the movie are so believable not the unrealistic moments you find in many Hollywood movies.

For me it definitely had too much of a GROUNDHOG DAY feeling to it, where if you mess up you can go back & start again. You definitely get the feeling that at the pre-production meeting someone asked for someone that sounds just like Hugh Grant because Domhnall (how is that pronounced?) Gleeson sounds just like him.

","Tim lives an ordinary and happy life with his odd family until his 21st birthday, when his father reveals to him that all the male descendants of the family are able to travel back in time through the events of their own time line. Tim will use this unexpected power to find the right girl with whom to spend the rest of his life. ""About Time"" has positively surprised me. Basically unknown in Italy, I admit that I've seen it just because I've read that there were time travels in the plot but, by the appearance of Tim's weird family I understood that I would have loved this movie: the ""rectangular, busy, unsentimental"" mother, the always available father, the ""free spirit"" sister, the impeccable uncle Desmond aren't so different from the relatives I use to know very well. The meeting and the life with Mary are maybe too perfect to seem real (yeah, I know, if you leave out the time travel thing) but fit in with the rest of the story. The last part of the movie was very touching: the farewell to Tim's father, the advices for a happy life and the walk on the beach (sure one of many for them), the very last glance at the past before move on with life. It is everyone's dream, to own the ability to travel through time, to go back and fix all those little (or big) imperfections of our lives that create embarrassment when you think about them, even after many years, and, let's face it, we don't like Tim at first because of his ability that makes his life perfect, while we, mere mortals, have to do the long way, without ever being able to see the consequences of our actions. But in the end we realize, as well as Tim, that we don't need to go back in time to be happy, but we have to live each day by focusing our attention on the good things rather than on those that went wrong, by remembering the good times and giving the right perspective to the bad ones."
"manja2005","7","2","3","4 January 2014"," This was Unexpected.
","The welding of a concept of time-travel to a rom-com,well,that,is indeed really unexpected.Time travel and rom-com are in the two opposite sides of the movie-genre spectrum and Richard Curtis does a quite impeccable job of bringing them together,and well,the end result is magnificent.<br/><br/>The movie,although is a romantic comedy,explores the relationship of a father with his son.The central theme of the story is that,Tim Hall,the protagonist of the film,inherits the ability to travel back in time from his father,and how he uses it to his advantage.<br/><br/>Although the movie is a different take on love stories,its like what a good love story should be,i.e. funny and interesting.The movie showcases the trials and tribulations of Tim,right from 21 years of age till he has his fourth child.Overall,Tim Hall leads a near perfect life,barring a few moments.<br/><br/>Having said that,well,the cons are,the movie gets a bit too dragged at times,and could have been shortened a bit.Also,the movie is a little bit too happy.But that's expected,since,the protagonist uses his gift very well to his advantage,to an extent,he can't. <br/><br/>The performances are beautiful,especially from Bill Nighy. As for Richard Curtis,in my opinion,I still feel his directorial debut,the love anthology film,Love Actually better than this one.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is a adorable,fun movie,one that is better,when watched with a loved one."

","This Movie shouldn't just be sought of as a Science Fiction flick, its the depiction of your daily life. The casting is really good, especially to Rachel McAdams (Mary)where you unknowingly fall in love with her. It's a superbly executed direction and there are times when you feel its all predictable but you are wrong. This takes you on an overwhelming ride where you are curious about each incident that occur to Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) whether he's going to actually use his power or not. This movie connects to all of us telling what to look for to keep you happy in life. whether you want to be selfish about you happy thing or not to be happy and help others to be happy sacrificing yours. The movie is enjoyable and there are instances in this movie that you could use it in you daily life.This is not the regular family movie where you will hear soft talks and see a lot of emotions, yeah its different. May be there a lot of movies out there like this about time travel and all but this one in particular doesn't try to spoil the fun of time travel and in-fact mix it up with love and family. I have never been a fan of romantic movies but this one has my attention for it's originality that it preserves throughout the film. It can be easily related to all. Well the rest is up to you to decide whether this movie leave you in an awe about life, if it didn't watch it again."
"zack-bananas-fry","8","2","3","3 January 2014"," Absolutely wonderful
","Before I start this review that I would like to point out that almost all of the negative reviews on this page are written by people who hate most (or all) Richard Curtis films. Now everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but if you hate those types of films, why watch it? Do you have nothing else to do other than insult a film you assume that you will hate from the start, and then give it a highly unnecessarily bad review of a film you have probably barely watched? <br/><br/>But that's not why I'm writing this; this review is being written because I think that 'About Time' is one of the funniest, most moving films I have ever seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot! The plot (or, as the slaughters would call the 'lack of') is about an ordinary, middle class man who, at a new year's eve party finds out that his family has the power to travel back in time. The film then shows the lovable main character find a girl, and have a relationship e.t.c. I won't go into details for the sake of ruining the film, but it is very sweet. I like the thought-provoking plot, I enjoyed most of Curtis' script, and thought that all but Bill Nighy were excellent. My reason for picking of Nighy is because he is one of my favourite actors, but his part was full of obvious, awkward dialogue that didn't really suit him, although he still made me laugh on more than one occasion! All in all, despite the fact that most people who dislike most of Richard Curtis's films will not like this, 'About Time' is a great film which should make the audience laugh, cry and be merry!"
"celluloidkiwi","9","2","3","3 January 2014"," Finally, romance and time travel done well...with romance
","With comedic timing and sad moments portrayed through excellent direction, it is hard pressed for any honest reviewer to find fault in this film.<br/><br/>Other than the simple fact that I, as a viewer, was not part of this truly fantastic script...I could only find fault in the scripted play on physics and temporal mechanics. Try as I might, I found that a darkened closet, clenched fists did little for me; that I was, in fact, not transported to my past and felt massively misled by the writers is of null effect. Nothing had, or will, change. Great movie. I did, however, ask my dad if there was anything he would like to tell me. He gave me a look and shook his head.<br/><br/>Oh well, anyway, acting is brilliant, script well paced and complete. Direction and lens are targeted and specific in regard to story. Really hard to find flaws in production or otherwise. Bring your heart to the venue. Very, very enjoyable movie."
"Ussel_Muadib","10","2","3","2 January 2014"," Richard Curtis does it again
","To start...any film with the gorgeous Rachel McAdams is on to a winner! I initially thought ""Curtis doing a Sci-Fi"" and was a bit worried this might distract from the story...however the time travel was simple (no computer generated graphics or anything fancy like that) but it worked well and didn't detract from the story line at all.<br/><br/>Its one of those films that has some great comedy but also has some lovely heart felt parts...especially when Tim goes back to see his dad 1 last time (this had me in tears).<br/><br/>A lovely story with a lovely ending...really gives you perspective at your own life and to make the most of each day as it comes.<br/><br/>10/10"
"sashans13","8","2","3","2 January 2014"," Not you average chick flick
","This movie is definitely something else.<br/><br/>When I first saw the cover photo (take a look at it!) I thought it was going to be another cheap romance movie, but was I wrong... The movie tells a story of a time traveler, but much unlike the idea is conveyed in other movies. Although marked a Sci-Fi movie, it takes the element of fiction from a philosophical point of view, as opposed to others which strain your brain by trying to merge fiction with laws of nature. There's a line in the movie that sums this up perfectly: ""Strange. And what about the whole... butterfly effect thing?"" -""What can I say? We don't seem to have messed up civilization yet."" It's simple: you travel back, change the present moment, voilà! They just don't care about the scientific aspect, which is a rather positive surprise.<br/><br/>On to the philosophical nature of the movie... Tim, the main character, is constantly bothered with series of questions: Do I go back in time? Should I change what just happened? Do I save my sister and lose my child, or just let her run the course of recovery on her own? It's an ongoing battle of thoughts, provocative thoughts at the very least.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Rachel McAdams makes for a perfect fit, I dare say this role suited her even better than the one in The Notebook. Domhnall Gleeson played out the average chump perfectly, without all the stereotypical facial expression exaggerations.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, I've seen many movies, but I've only now registered at IMDb with sole purpose to write this review. One of the best movies I've seen, hands down."
"Jordi_R","7","2","3","19 November 2013"," Beautiful and sweet romantic comedy-drama
","The film lasts around two hours and maybe the first part of it is more like a romantic comedy and the second part is a bit more emotive all mixed with the idea of travelling in time.<br/><br/>The first part is similar to Notting Hill, boy meet girl with funny situations and good dialogues. The main characters (Rachel McAdams, Domhnall Gleeson)are charming the whole film.<br/><br/>The second part is a bit more dramatic but with a positive message. This is the life.<br/><br/>The film turned out to be an enjoyable movie and have enough tension to keep it interesting"
"DarthPaul85","7","2","3","4 November 2013"," Less ""Groundhog Day"" and more ""Love Actually""
","This is a great example of a movie without real drama. Or rather, without melodrama. <br/><br/>I can't quite fit it into any genre because everything is so understated. The acting, the plot, etc- everything has a sort of dulled ""real life"" flow to it. There's no emotional outbursts, no unbelievable comic mishaps (with maybe one or two exceptions), and no real clear ending to the story. <br/><br/>It's like we're just watching some guy live out some of his life, and like real life, not a heck of a lot actually *happens* (in a movie sense, anyway). <br/><br/>But that's not necessarily a bad thing; the movie's strength is in its characters. I loved the main character, and just about all the supporting characters are enjoyable. They all have a sort of level- headed-ness that is usually omitted for the sake of movie-drama. <br/><br/>But therein lies my disappointment with the film- with such a great premise, I wonder why they decided to play it down rather than up? The hook was seemingly made to be an all-out comedy- with the ability to ""undo"" your mistakes or actions, why not let the characters go to extremes? The events of the movie and the character's use of his power remain frustratingly low-key. <br/><br/>This film is less Groundhog Day and more Love Actually. And that's fine, I love Love Actually, but if that's the movie you're going to make, why give your character a super-power? The ""gimmick"" is never exploited to its full potential, and despite a smooth script and lovable characters, I was left a little disappointed."

","I watched this movie at the cinema, after many recommendations of my friends on their facebook. <br/><br/>I was trying to keep my brain like a blank paper, stay away from all information about this movie before watching that. Just need to know that is ""must watching"" movie is all enough. To be honest, after 60 minutes watching, I talked to myself. ""Oh my god, I wasted 60 minutes of my life to watch bullshit love story"". But after that, I don't remember exactly ""when"", maybe after the main actor getting marry. I could not take my mind off the movie. It was very touching at the rest.<br/><br/>I don't like the very first 60 minutes, but the rest of the movie was good. Because I love watching movie about the love of people in a family. Which is not the hottest or controversial topic but tender and touching. It's really impressive to watch the man argued himself ""his new born baby"" or ""more times with his father"". Finally, he had to obey the rule of nature. Let his father go away but all beautiful moment of him still keeping in the bottom of his heart. <br/><br/>It's not new, "" similar ingredient"" but still good enough to keep you staying to watch till the last scene. <br/><br/>I love the message of this movie ""Enjoy every single moment of your life"" – It's quite simple but it seems we always forget that.

","""About Time"" (12A) Director: Richard Curtis. Starring: Rachel McAdams, Bill Nighy, Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hollander. Rated: 12A, for containing infrequent strong language and moderate sex references. Running Time: 123 minutes. Out Now in UK cinemas.<br/><br/>Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), is not having any luck with the ladies. On the day of his 21st birthday, Tim's luck finally changes for the better, when his dad (Bill Nighy) explains to Tim that all the men in his family; are able to travel in time. Bewildered, Tim decides to use this new-found gift, in order to find the girl of his dreams. <br/><br/>Having directed his third feature film (including ""About Time""), Richard Curtis has established himself as the perfect man to write a romantic comedy. From bumbling men (Hugh Grant) to a wickedly funny priest (Rowan Atkinson),Curtis is never unable to create iconic characters. <br/><br/>His last effort, ""The Boat That Rocked"", was shallow to say the least. It seemed as though Curtis had started with a great idea, cast and soundtrack, but lost something along the way. The script perhaps?<br/><br/>Anyway, ""About Time"" is by no means a disappointment; it really is a warm welcome back to the genre Curtis has helped to perfect. <br/><br/>Out of all the romantic comedies available, ""About Time"" is the one that I would gladly watch again. There have been so many terrible comedies lately, its hard to find one which is adequate for viewing. But, ""About Time"" is near perfect.<br/><br/>The performances from the whole cast are fantastic, with a particularly funny, yet sarcastic character named Harry (Tom Hollander). Domhnall Gleeson is terrific and proves he is one of best young actors on our screens today. Rachel McAdams acts well but doesn't seem to bring much flair to her character.<br/><br/>The film also explores the time travel genre with fun and quirky quips, but also poses questions to the audience which prove to be interesting. It goes without saying, that Curtis can almost definitely write a good script when given time to mature, and that he has done.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>""About Time"" is a joy to behold, teaching but never preaching, the film delivers a decent message about enjoying life to the full; cleansed in clean jokes and interesting characters. Don't miss it, unless you can travel back in time!<br/><br/>7 stars out of 10."
"Jonnybarkphotos","7","2","3","15 September 2013"," A true feel good film
","To pick apart this film would be far too cruel, because it's innocence has left most with a skip in their step and tear in their eye. Behind the extremely long duration, it was a sweet picture that expressed itself well and took audiences' through the rewarding story of Tim's (Domhnall Gleeson) life, after the discovery of his father's (Bill Nighy) secret, that the men in the family could travel in time. It featured warming performances from Bill Nighy, Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson, creating relatable characters and making an unbelievable story bitter-sweet. The comedy was both written and presented well by Richard Curtis, despite been more melancholy than his previous work it made an excellent caricature of a nervous romance and was in places, really funny. Being labelled as a romantic comedy, one would believe 'About Time' is a story of boy means girl, which is true at the start, but it develops more harmony throughout. Different relationships were explored and as each developed, the film developed a broader, more universal meaning. Even though it was a feel good portrait, it also felt very safe. Over explanatory, and slow; not making it lose it's essence but causing glances to watch now and again. Definitely worth the watch, but as films go, it could have been much better."

","I've had lots of movies that I've once considered a favorite, but nothing could compare to this film. It bothers me that this movie is marketed as a ""rom-com,"" because that cheapens the true beauty of it. Yes this movie has a romantic storyline, but that does not dominate the film and in fact is over and done with after the wedding only half way through the movie. This movie is not a romance film, but a film about life. Tim's journey is not just about getting married, but about how he uses his power to have the best life possible and help the people around him in any way he can. For once a movie has characters that feel real and not like hollywood caricatures. The characters feel like people you could really meet and their relationships feel beyond real. This movie will make you laugh and cry and feel like you have a better understanding of and outlook on life. This movie means so much to me and I am forever grateful that I discovered it!"

"stephenreedcpa","5","1","1","19 November 2019"," I really wanted to like this movie, but couldn't get past the narcissistic fairy tale
","The movie was well acted, heartwarming, and had its really funny moments. But I couldn't get past the fairy tale narcissicm as the core of the story. The main idea seemed to be that if your day/week/year wasn't perfect, wouldn't it be great to travel back in time and have a do-over until it was near perfect? You could be loved and admired by everyone and have the perfect life and relationship you always wanted, the narcissist's dream. The core of this idea was when the uncle said ""my brother told me on your wedding day how much he loved me, it was the happiest day of my life."", after the brother/dad, presumably, traveled back in time multiple times to redo his wedding speech until he got the absolute perfect combination, his words so profound he could make his brother have the best day of his entire life.<br/><br/>Yes, we do get a watered down message toward the end that Jim, the protagainst, has decided he doesn't need to travel back in time much at all anymore, but you can bet he wouldn't hesitate a moment if something disasterous were to occur. With the fairy tale ending of the near perfect relationship and happy family life and great friendships produced, in large part, due to previous time travel adventures, I wouldn't want to travel back in time either.<br/><br/>Also, the rules didn't make much sense. We are told you can travel back but not forward, yet when Jim does travel back, he seems to be able to instantly travel forward again at least up to the furthest moment in time he has experienced. I thought he also couldn't do anything different before the conception of his children without them being conceived and born differently, but he seems, toward the end, to find a loophole to this as well, being able to spend time with his dad as a kid.<br/><br/>All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, just that it could've been so much more without the fairy tale and narcissistic nonsence at the core of the story."

One thing that carries this movie is an exceptional cast. I am a firm believer Bill Nighy could very well be one of the best actors of our time.<br/><br/>The story is so well done that I have seen it multiple times and each time I feel like I get a little more emotion out of it.

Although happiness can be found in many ways of course as this is shown in the movie too. Bill Nighy is the total winner again with his fantastic humour and humanity.

"sharky_55","8","1","1","18 August 2019"," You did, Dad. It was implied.
","There is a feeling one gets when watching a Richard Curtis film. The warmth starts from your middle, and then spreads out gradually to the tips of your fingers and toes. These stories are cinematic chicken soup for soul. It's that involuntary ""aah' that escapes whilst clutching a hot mug, as Wesley Morris puts it. Fine class dining it is not; merely a few ingredients tossed into a bubbling broth, but what could be better on a chilly Friday night? Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill made us believe we could slide right into the gang, or that we were laughing along right there at the Thacker dinner table, another etching into their modest, working class tapestry. His directorial debut Love Actually doubled down on this ensemble approach, beating audiences into submission with schmaltzy sentimentalism. And isn't that what Christmas movies are for? If you're going to commit, you might as well go all in. Roll that montage.<br/><br/>About Time isn't about any ordinary British family, but it's endearing enough that it almost could be. The Lakes live by seaside in Cornwall, an idyllic childhood peppered with tea parties on the beach and projected films in the garden by moonlight and rain, their umbrellas unfurled in a Wes Anderson-esque tableau. The well-meaning Uncle Desmond is the film's sounding board for the level of affection that connects them, a life-sized teddy bear who offers warm words when you squeeze his palm. (Kit Kat is the only misstep here; she's everything you'd ever want in a sister, but she's not real, every pixie skip and tackle-hug straining the realms of authenticity). And the wonderful Bill Nighy is the heart of it all, able to distill philosophical tenets that might sound heavy or on-the-nose when spoken by others into bite-sized wisdom that can be offered over a game of ping pong. He's so grounded in his presence that he never lets the film get lost in its twee.<br/><br/>Is that too strong of a word? About Time is not shy about its quaintness, but leans into it gently and invites the audience to pull up a chair. The Lakes are well off, but the phrase 'rich' would never drift into your mind during your viewing. The wedding could have been an extravagant affair, yet Curtis introduces a torrent of rain to wash away any pretense or fanciful notions, and in the end the speeches take place in a cramped little tea room with the guests crouching or standing or squashed next to each other on sofas or folding chairs, all a bit damp. It would be hard to see Americans be this self-deprecatory, or not play it for laughs. And there's never ever a thought of jumping back in time for a redo.<br/><br/>This is low key sci-fi at its best, the time travel element almost accepted as simply magical realism. That this mechanic is never quite properly explained may irk some more hardcore fans, but I think it's beside the point. I've spoken before about Curtis' little touches but they are worth a mention here, a style so light and soft that you feel welcome immediately. His cinematography is cozy personified, shallow focus and warm, diffused light tracking the pair through the streets of London as if they were the only two people alive in the city that night, the universe still as they fall for each other. This is the meet cute at its optimal cuteness, with the preceding dialogue on their (literal) blind date a textbook on how to write dialogue for said meet cute, hitting all the right areas: some humour to lighten things up, a smattering of self-deprecation, and just the right amount of chemistry. See how Mary emerges from the restaurant and reveals herself to Tim for the first time, stumbling slightly on the step, backlit as if a halo hovers over her head, and a hint of smile framed by a fringe. I bought it at once. No amount of time travel could make Charlotte love him, but for Mary it was just a matter of time."

"cemanycem","9","1","1","7 August 2019"," A Fun Twist on the Romance Genre
","I generally find romantic films to be drab, uninteresting, and ultimately unrealistic. This film forms a brilliant and moving exception. Really, the movie doesn't completely center around the romance between the Tim and Mary played by Domnhall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams respectively, the film's main focus by the end of the film is on a more abstract message and broad theme which simply highlights the importance of enjoying life while you have it. Tim's relationship with his father serves as an equally important relationship throughout the film and it is through this relationship that the movie's central message is conveyed. The ability of the men in Tim's family to travel back in time is handled quite well and is used as a mechanic to advance the plot and supplement it rather than dictate and hold it back. Ultimately, what I thought was going to be a simple romance film with a unique sci-fi-esque twist on it with the guy getting the girl in the end turned into an incredibly unique film with its own fresh plot structure and critically important message. Live each day as if it is your last, cherish every moment, it is all we have."

"jrarichards","8","1","1","28 July 2019"," Nice rom-com with somewhat flawed sci-fi
","Assuming you're a fan, and assuming therefore that you for example regard ""Love, Actually"" as overall the greatest romantic comedy ever made (I do), then you're going to go into this 6-year-old movie happy to find another piece of ultra-British work from Writer-Director Richard Curtis. And from the off, you're going to be happy to find - once again with Curtis - a diverse collection of great British music in there, and scenes of an incredibly photogenic and sympathetic London, as well as a simply-gorgeous Cornwall (how blessed might a country be to boast both within its borders, as separated by a journey of 4 or 5 hours?)<br/><br/>Most likely, a typical viewer will also find the core-pairing here, of Canadian Rachel McAdams and Irishman Domhnall Gleeson as Mary and Tim, pretty irresistible; and be more than content to find a supporting cast including both Bill Nighy (as Tim's dad) and Tom Hollander, with a very creditable Lydia Wilson as Tim's sister, and with small parts for Margot Robbie, Tom Hughes and even Richard Griffiths and Richard E. Grant.<br/><br/>More dubious is the ""complication"" of the basic love story with an ability of Tim's (shared with his dad) to time travel. And here we see done less well and less convincingly what was done very well indeed (if darkly and scarily) in ""The Butterfly Effect""; or else to massive comedic and feelgood efect in ""Back to the Future"". Tim's dad tells him there are certain ""rules"" that come with this ability, yet every analyst online I've seen believes these rules are flouted in various ways, and that was absolutely also my conclusion.<br/><br/>Whether a film can survive that would seem a good question, but of course this movie does...<br/><br/>It's not without it's gravitas, as Tim does indeed resemble the Ashton Kutcher part in ""Butterfly"" in having to make some difficult choices as he strives to use his gift to make things better or put them right in semi-godlike fashion. However, while all may be fair in love and war, Tim's desire to successfully improve his ""first time"" with Mary is not a matter of life and death and IS (as some reviewers have wisely noted) a kind of sexual exploitation of a beloved partner, in which - admittedly - she benefits by getting a better version of the coitus each time, but is only aware of one (the final) time - while he basically has a repeat randy sex and lust fest with the girl he does genuinely love, but also clearly lusts after. It's dubious to say the least.<br/><br/>Indeed, this huge and potentially very serious part of Tim's life is kept entirely secret from Mary throughout the tale - an unustainable situation, especially in a marriage and life that purports to be as close as theirs is. Ironically, Tim's sister does learn his secret, which makes what is - in a sense - ""perpetrated against"" Mary look even worse.<br/><br/>(Fairly) obviously, ""About Time"" still has enough going for it to satisfy most viewers and to leave a mostly warm feeling. However, any deeper analysis will leave the piece looking a bit threadbare. A pity in that sense, so it's more a 7.5 than an 8, but OK."

","Genre: Romance, Comedy, Fantasy, Drama.<br/><br/>'About Time' is the story of a man who at the age of 21 discovers that all men in his family could time travel and he lives the rest of his life changing things that didn't go well as he wanted them to. This includes, getting his first girlfriend, helping Harry, finding his true love, Mary, making everything go perfect between them in multiple trials, saving his sister from an accident and then undoing it, meeting his father even after he died and everything in between these. Richard Curtis, well-known for his heartfelt movies like Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jone's Diary and much more, did an extremely pleasing work with this movie too. This was the kind of rom-com that had equally-balanced humor along with romance. The background score of the movie made watching the movie as if I was star-gazing. I could just go on and on for hours. Tim (Domnhall Gleeson) was the main character. Mary (Rachel McAdams), Tim's Dad (Bill Nighy), Mom (Lindsay Duncan), Kit Kat, his sister (Lydia Wilson), Uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery) and few other supporting actors made the cast for this movie.
Tim and Kit Kat were the kind of siblings everyone of us has; pulling legs and watching their backs at reasonable phases of life. Kit Kat helps Tim get Mary when he once lost her for his friend, Harry, while Tim made sure he was there for Kit Kat when she met with a terrible accident after having a huge fight with her boyfriend, Jimmy, with whom she sort of had an abusive relationship and also made her undo all her wrong partner choices with his time travelling ability. He was also there to make Kit Kat feel good when she said- I am the faller of the family, and felt miserable.
Uncle Desmond was a very sweet character to go with. I fell for him when he told Tim when they all knew about Tim's Dad's cancer-
'At your wedding he said he loved me. That was the best day of my life, so this is probably the worst.'
It showed how much he loved his brother.
Mary, on the other hand, was an assistant at a publisher and did reading for a living. She was an insecure woman who is obsessed with Kate Moss. I like how Mary isn't shown a perfect always-feel-good character. She almost had me when she told Tim's Mom-
'Well, I'm very insecure.
I, um, I've a very bad temper sometimes.'
It almost felt like a personal attack to me.
The best supporting actor is ofcourse, Nighy, who played Tim's Dad. His character is a wise above middle-aged man. He guided Tim on how to use his time travelling power in the real sense to live life to the fullest. He had all the qualities a son would look in his father, so much love and care, and also a bit Dad-humor. Tim, the main lead, was a kind man. He loved his family and his wife and kids. He always wanted to do everything perfect by going back in the moment again and again. But, by the end he realizes, that's not how you live, live life to moments, and you won't ever have to travel back to correct things. The movie has a mixed ending, sad and happy. Tim's dad dies, but eventually the family becomes fine. For the happy part, Tim and Mary live happily ever after with three of their kids.
I had lost the thing I always had for happy endings, but I found myself falling for it this time like a kid. Suddenly, I could believe in all the happiness that just exists and might cross paths with our lives at atleast some point of time.
The heart of the movie, is ofcourse, father-son relationship. In all, it's a sweet-sour movie that provokes questions and leaves you in happy-tears at the end."

","""About Time"" takes a simple life lesson: ""live every day of your life to the fullest""; and creates a wonderful love story that explores this message, expands it, and makes you reconsider the truly important things in life. This is not only a romatic love story, but it is a familial love story, and a self-love story. Domnhall Gleeson's character takes us through a touching journey of insecurity, determination, and self-realization. The film is shot in a very simplistic manner that makes the audience feel like they are in the streets of London as the two main characters fall in love right next to them."

"tesswysko","10","1","1","23 May 2019"," TRULY About Time I Watched This, & You Should Too!
","I've been avoiding this movie for a while. For female I hate chick flicks. I'm more of a Die Hard kind of girl. And I Netflix the icon definitely look like a chick flick. But I went ahead and pulled up the description and it sounded pretty good actually about time travel and Bill Nighy was in the cast so I figured it must be a comedy and I truly needed something to make me laugh right now. My health is failing and I have a lot of stress at home with my son graduating high school and turning 18 so I thought what the heck I'll give it a chance. And boy did I bet on the right horse!<br/><br/>The first thing was I couldn't quiet place this ginger kid but there was something so special and magnetic about him. So I had to come to IMDb to look it up, and it was definitely an epic facepalm! How could I not know that I was sitting here watching a Gleason?!?! And not just any Gleason, but the one who made my toes curl when he played Bill Weasley in the Harry Potter franchise! And I kind of thought that the female lead looked a little familiar but she was so mousy that I didn't figure she was anybody I'd seen that I would try to store in my memory banks, But as time went by they made her look better and better and I realized it was Rachel McAdams! For goodness sakes the actress from another one of my absolute favorite movies! So this cast is full of star-studded actors and actresses now we've got that down we can move on LOL!<br/><br/>I do not like spoilers myself when I read these so I will guarantee you that I'm not going to give you more than a trailer or what a reviewer would give you so if you're looking for that I'm really sorry I'm sure somebody else in here we'll give that to you but I want you to enjoy it and appreciate it for yourself but what I will give you is some background and enough to make you really want to watch this movie! This is about a young man who's been raised to be an absolute gentleman and that is what he is he lives on his family's beachfront property with Mom, Dad, sister, an uncle who's a little bit off his rocker that is an absolute sweetheart. One day his dad takes him aside and tells him that the men in his family can travel through time. Not forward but backwards. They can go back and change minor things not like the history of War but like what shirt they wore to work yesterday. And doing little things like that they can affect certain outcomes in their lives. He's never had a love, and one summer his sister brings up a friend, and he really really likes her. And the last day before she leaves she finally gets up the nerve to tell her. And she tells him it's too bad you waited till the last minute basically because I liked you too. So he goes back in time and tells her earlier feeling confident because of what she told him. And she tells him well why don't we see where this summer goes and you asked me on my last day. So she's giving him all kinds of mixed messages and treating him pretty awful. When she leaves so does he. He begins his career in a law firm, and immediately and awkward young man befriends him. And we find that through the years our hero helps to make this awkward young man less awkward and the awkward young man's friendship helps our hero come out of his shell. But one night they go to a restaurant where you eat in the dark. They are seated with two female friends. They actually hit it off and agreed to meet outside of the restaurant and the minute that our hero sees the woman he's been chatting with and feeding strawberry dessert to, all thoughts of his previous summer Crush are wiped from his head. She's self-conscious and can't believe that he's interested in her, but he asks for her number and she gives it to him. He goes away so happy but when he gets home he finds out that his roommate who is an old friend of his father's had his show - he's a playwright - completely Tanked because the lead male actor forgot his lines! So our hero being the complete gentleman that he is uses his time shifting abilities to go back in time 2 fix things and only finds that by making sure that that gentleman remembers his lines, the males that he's playing opposing to then forgets his lines! So he has to shift through time again and ends up holding scrip cards for that guy so he can read the script and the show ends up being a huge success! But when he goes to call Mary the girl he met, her phone number is completely gone from his phone! This is where I'm going to end it because I don't want to give anything away. I think it's important for you to watch and see what happens, obviously he's going to use this time shifting abilities to find her because he had nothing other than her phone number to go on in the fact that she loves Kate Moss. His sister and His Friends help. That's what happens when you're a good person, people want to see you happy because they love you. And in the end that's what this movie was about with love and being surrounded by good people. I seldom go away feeling really good after watching a movie. Sure I've gone away laughing from watching a movie like Ghostbusters, and I've gone away quoting a movie like Friday, and I've gone away starry-eyed from watching a movie like The Notebook, but this movie made me feel really good about life in the people that I have in my life.<br/><br/>So I'm to my typical positive and negative section. It is on rare occasion that I ever give out a 10 star rating, and that is because it is on rare occasion that a movie actually deserves a 10 star rating! This movie suckered me in with beautiful cinematography; a moving family dynamic- you could feel the love especially when he started disparaging his mother because you could tell it was all jokingly in a loving manner; and the use of such brilliant colors! It Really just made everything pop and really brought a feeling of happiness and positivity to the good times in the film! The dynamic between our hero and our heroin was just amazing. You can tell that these two are amazing actors because you could almost testify that they were in love. The script was amazing, the acting was amazing, every single person in this did their best and you could feel it!
Now on to the negatives. And obviously there can't be too many for me to have given it a 10. And obviously the negatives can't be that negative in order to keep that 10. There is an issue with his sister that has to be overcome, and it's a pretty big, really dangerous issue. I don't think the way it was handled was handled with appropriate severity and sensitivity to the issue. There is one other thing but unlike how I could dance around the above thing I can't dance around this so I'm going to have to let it go LOL!<br/><br/>All in all this was an absolutely amazing movie it should definitely be viewed by anyone who's looking to feel good about their day, themselves, the situation they find themselves in, or just anything in general! It's just a feel-good movie! Don't waste your time himming and hawing, it's ""About Time"" to watch this movie!"

","A perfect movie. (I've said that twice this past week as I've revisited some of my favourites films.) This is more than a love story about blossoming love (Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams), there are a wide variety of love stories in this, not the least of which is that of a father and his son (Bill Nighy and Domhnall). Lovely supporting cast. Great performances. Beautiful and textured writing. Exceptional music. Life affirming moments and profound words side by side with the humour of life. I've watched this many times (and even, accidently, bought two digital copies). I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Unconventional Drama about Love}.

","I first saw this in the theater 5 or 6 years ago and have probably seen it 15 times since. It is charming, loving and sentimental in the absolute best sense of the words. Tim (Domnhall Gleeson) is raised by his book-loving Dad, artsy Mom, and daft Uncle Desmond with his sprite of a sister KitKat in a great cluttered home on the edge of the sea in Cornwall. Tim and his Dad (a marvelous Bill Nighy) share a love for table tennis, an Italian singer who appears to have a dead beaver on his head, and each other. Dad tells Tim about a male-inherited ability to time travel to be used for those moments when getting it just right can change your life. Tim moves to London where he falls instantly in love with the lovely Mary (Rachel McAdams). The soundtrack to their relationship is spot on - their everyday routine set to music is an homage to making every moment count. I loved each of the major characters - sweet KitKat and lovable Uncle Desmond provide a counter-point to the easy joy of Mary and Tim, friends Jay, Harry and Rory are each part of the extended family. The scenery, set design, and London locations are pure Richard Curtis with the Tube as a major player and a wild Cornwall storm made another character in the story. There are some wildly funny moments, and a lot of tears for a romcom. As many times as I've seen it, I want to see it again, even though I always end up with tears on my cheeks"
"apryla-58795","10","1","1","1 February 2019"," Should be required watching
","A beautiful story about time travel and the importance of making every moment count.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson (perfect in this role) plays Tim who at 21 discovers from his dad (the brilliant Bill Nighy) that the men in the family can time travel. Although preposterous the movie is more about relationships and how doing one thing different can alter our lives forever. The film seems to drag a bit through the middle as you aren't really sure where it's going but by the last part of the movie it all comes together and it is so touching and sweet that it just makes you want to examine your life and your choices and move forward accordingly.<br/><br/>The acting is so good. Everyone did a fantastic job. I can't see anyone else working in those roles. Bill Nighy is perfect in every role he takes on. I've loved him ever since Love Actually when his character said, ""And remember kids-don't buy drugs...become a rock star and they'll give them to you!"" He embodies every role he's in and he makes you believe he's actually the person he's playing. He was so sweet in this role. He was so relaxed and I realized after the fact that he truly is brilliant because his character was living every day twice in order to fully appreciate it. This would have made him more at ease as a person because he'd already lived through it once and would therefore know what was coming.<br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the actress who played the sister but she was very good in this as well as the actor who played Rory.<br/><br/>This is not overly sappy but it has a great message and other than the time travel thing it plays out very realistically.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this at least once."
"antoniokowatsch","8","1","1","31 January 2019"," A smart and funny ""time travel"" story
","Oh my goodness! I was a little hesitant to watch this movie seeing as I am not a big fan of romance flicks. But I have to admit, this one was way better than I expected it to be. This is one of the best time travel movies I've seen even though it completely disregards the scientific aspects of time travel and instead opts for a ""fantasy""-explanation. You're definitely going to have a good laugh with this movie. The comedy is on point. And at the same time there's enough drama to balance the movie, so that it doesn't become a corny and cheesy flick.
Just like the title suggests this movie isn't really about ""time travel"" per se but rather about time itself. Especially the end segment makes it perfectly clear that we, the viewers, should focus on ""living in the moment"" by truly embracing the ""time"" that we're given instead of focusing on ""What if's"" and regrets. It's a good message.<br/><br/>Overall it is a fairly unique and interesting movie. Whereas most time travel movies focus on the science, this movie goes the fantasy route and focuses more on the emotional aspects of time travel. And it worked out pretty well. You should definitely give this movie a watch. You won't regret it."

I find the romance forced and the characters sappy and unrealistic. And yet this film is unabashedly my favorite film of all time.<br/><br/>As I rewatched it tonight for what might be the tenth time now, I noticed new things just like I always do. I fall in love with Rachel McAdams just that much more. And I cry more and more every time. Director Richard Curtis chose to separate this rom com not through adding a sci-fi element, even though that's present, but by making this a story about life. About love. About Time. And as we see his characters grow naturally after we meet them for the first time, we attach to them and become a part of their family. We grow with them. We cry with them. And it always brings me to tears by the end, a long flow of tears of happiness for how beautiful this film is.<br/><br/>Tonight, I had a new experience with About Time, too.

","Films about time travel always intrigue me especially when done well. About time is a good example of that. What starts as a simple time travel story to improve a person's life becomes a story about family, heartbreak and life lessons. The protagonist shows that he never takes a day for granted and the people around him for granted. From the outset the film takes a positive note and shows a positive character that is tolerable and likable for the most part. Not only is it interesting the events that unfold in this person's extraordinary ordinary life are quite entertaining to watch. The drama is also well executed when Tim finds that there are trade offs and challenges he faces with his ability. The supporting cast especially, Bill Nighy do a great job. <br/><br/>If you can get over the technical feasibility of time travel and the romantic or heartfelt fluff you will certainly enjoy this film.

"camarshall-36934","8","1","1","5 April 2017"," About Time, Ironically ,Reviewed after Time has Passed.
","This is still a great production and has the potential to become a slow-burn cult film.<br/><br/>The film's strength, paradoxically, is its weakness. It's very Englishness, it's middle-classness, the 'niceness' of its lead characters evokes an England (yes, an England - not a Britain) that never was except for a privileged few - and that is a hugely attractive draw. The characters have warmth, genuineness and kindness and live in a gentleness and sophistication that we would all like to experience. For many people this is far from the reality of life and so this is, effectively, English Disney. <br/><br/>This middle-class Englishness pervades all of Richard Curtis' films. From this point, the film lacks originality. We have seen it all before. We have also seen the time-travelling scenario. In this case, the technicality that Tim jumps back and creates a parallel happening, is overlooked - perhaps for reasons of practicality. We don't know what happens to Tim and his family in the life stream that he has left behind as he continues to live his new 'amended' life. But,perhaps, that is just me being picky but I will resist the temptation to travel back in time and erase that comment or it will be totally lost!<br/><br/>Put those two minor flaws aside and you have film that is full of warmth and heart. This film does make you value the people who have contributed positively to your life and what you, personally, would do when someone was injured or when the inevitable time comes to say goodbye. It also reminds you of the awful and awkward gawkiness of your youth and how you wish you had handled it differently. I loved the scenes where Tim travelled back and replaced his crassness with emotional intelligence and sincerity. <br/><br/>All of the performances are strong. Bill Nighy is as wonderfully Bill Nighy as ever, Lindsay Duncan gives an original, spiky and strong performance as the strangely unnamed mother , Domnhall Leeson projects a fragile and maturing appeal and will inevitably morph into Hugh Grant as he he ages and, while I loved Richard Cordery's Uncle Desmond, the plot purpose of this role was somewhat lost on me. I can only assume that it was to emphasise the complete warmth and acceptance of loving someone for whom they are and that existence can be enough in itself. <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is perfectly lovely and the ever-wonderful Tom Hollander is grumpily magnificent. Joshua McGrath's Rory is a joy to watch (not least because he has recreated a friend of mine!) and, perhaps, a little bit more could have been made of Will Merrick's Jay. He has all the makings of a great 'Richard Curtis' character.<br/><br/>So, for me, this is a feel-good film and there's nothing wrong with that. Like Richard Curtis' other films it is a welcome retreat to a screen family for whom you could love and care and whom you know well. Definitely a classic to snuggle up to on the sofa with something alcoholic, or someone warm at the end of a trying day."
"pogirikalasagar","8","1","1","15 August 2016"," Its ''About Time"" we change
","""About Time"" is a romantic comedy. It's witty, clever, intelligent and funny. The centrepiece of the film is the relationship between Tim (Domnhall Gleeson), a young lawyer living in London, and his father (Bill Nighy), who lives with Tim's mother (Lindsay Duncan) in Cornwall.This a story of a guy who can time-travel and has the ability to fine-tune moments of one's past. Tim and his dad have some heart-to-heart talks that end up becoming lessons for all of us in how to live.This was a very sweet and thoughtful film highlighting how momentary decisions can completely alter your life's path.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the humour and wide range of emotions the story explored. Have you ever wondered what might the present be like, if your choice had differed in the past. We often tend to think that few times and regret over the choices we made in the past. I myself have done this quite a lot.<br/><br/>The main character in this movie, Tim, turns out to be the same. Tim always seems down and unsatisfied with his life.He wants to do things differently and wants his life to be different. As the story progresses he finds out that he has powers that he always wished, and learns how to use them. Then he falls in love unexpectedly. Then he starts his journey of life towards the love he is searching for. This constitutes the best part of the movie. His journey of life lets us learn many important things about life and how to really be happy and how to lead a peaceful life.Through Vicissitudes of life and love he learns few things about himself and what he should be focusing on. I suggest you to watch this movie and to see & learn for yourselves, what exactly are the precious moments of life and the attitude we need to have for this one and only precious life. <br/><br/>Characters are perfectly casted. Performance, screenplay & all are first class. But the best is the Presentation of emotions which could be linked to every single person who ever Loved someone.That is why it is one my favorite's when it comes to comedy and romance. And it's also a film of quite surprising depth."

","A young man, Tim becomes aware of his own ability of time slip and hears this ability has been handed down from generations. He use this ability for making his life and his family's life better, particular his own love. Through his time travel, he grows up.<br/><br/>In spite of SF or time-travel style, this movie has love story and family story. Taking in time travel naturally, the theme of movie is wide, I think. The balance of parts of comedy and serious are good, so I can watch it with comfortable tempo.<br/><br/>This movie is one of my favorite movie. I like a scene where Tim and his father have the last meeting and he can never to meet again. It moved me. This film told me how important ""now"" is. It's so warm story."

","IT is a love story with a small element of science fiction.

Beginning from their impressive encounter, it portrays how they get along with, get married and have a family. However, what makes a difference from any other popular love story is that the story goes back and forward because of the ability of time-travel. It makes it possible that the story get complicated and excited. Furthermore, as the title implies, it gives out the message of the preciousness of time. Observing the development of love between them, you'll figure out the value of time because it never goes back and forward in the real life unlike the case of the drama. <br/><br/>In short, it is not the simple story which entertains you from the aspect of love, but the one that conveys the philosophical message to the audience."

This movie sparks emotions like when I saw the Notebook and Frequency.

","I cried. I cried a lot. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be a boring cliché love story. That was definitely not the case. The story line flows well and I'm usually a person to poke holes in plots, but I found myself completely enchanted throughout the whole film. I instantly fell in love which each character even with the little screen time they had. The love this film conveys is not the typical love story between a man and a woman, but the love a person shares which each person in their life. With that, the love story between the two main characters felt so genuine and pure, yet the best part is that that's not what the whole movie is about.

All of the Richard Curtis movies are awesome but this one stands out, literally. The critics gave this movie only 70% rating, I mean seriously, this movie deserves a 100% rating, literally and second I want to clarify something this is not just a rom-com or chick flick because a) tell me one movie like this one b) I am a guy and I love this movie and ask any guy if he don't love this movie, then he is a jerk, trust me, just WATCH THIS MOVIE, it brilliant and it seriously not a rom-com, it a dramatic comedy of family, love and Life."

","First of all, i'm not ""english born"", so bare with me any mistake.<br/><br/>This is my first review on IMDb, being about one of my favorite movies of all time, in great part because I miss my dad a lot. I'm ""the boyfriend"" like a few reviewers said, and not one bit I've felt bad about watching this movie, instead I've watched this movie like 10 times already. I like to thing in myself as a romantic, but a romantic who also like action movies, and Sci-fi, and intellectual stuff, and a lot of other stuff. <br/><br/>I like Interstellar a lot, a movie that manage to give one of the best time travel facts. But this movie isn't about time travel, is about life. Isn't about the love of our life, but the joy, the hardness, the decisions, and the many loves of our mundane but brilliant life. Like I said before, this movie moves me a lot, I love my father immensely and would give a lot for just 10 more minutes with him. And I love my girlfriend and mother. And I'm pretty sure I'm gonna love my children one day. What makes this world so extraordinary is the people we love. <br/><br/>People can be too judgmental when they only can see half the picture. Open your eyes, try to go see a movie with an open mind and not trying to catch their flaws, and you could be in for a treat."

"RResende","Null","1","1","25 April 2016"," spotless sunshine
","This is very clearly a writer's film, with strong self-reference to more than one writing issue.<br/><br/>The most obvious and extensively used device is the time quirk that literally creates the whole story: the main character (and all the males in his family) have the ability to go back in time, revisit scenes of their own lives, and change them. This means that every scene in the film does not have a definitive script. Everything can be changed, all the time. So the film flows as an ever provisional reality, the way a writer works on a script, or for those matters, the way any creative artist works. The girl works as a book publisher, reading books from people, commenting, choosing, changing them. That's a wink.<br/><br/>The other, more clever device, is the inversion of the genre rules that come with the time travel trick. The film presents itself apparently as a romantic comedy that evolves into a light drama. The drama is born from the natural course of life - people die, life goes on, kids are born there are no tensions brought upon the relation between the romantic couple exactly to emphasize how normal life is what drives the fate of these characters. There is a moment when the possibility of adultery presents itself to the male character, but he drives it away, and this underlines again how definitive is the relationship between the couple. But he can travel in time, which means that even the facts of life are editable. So he goes back in time, and tries to change things like the poor love choices of his sister. The tension is all put on the struggle between the main character and his ever changeable fate It's an inversion of the rules, in which pawn and queen are brought to the same game level, one fighting the other. Imagine Gone in the wind if Scarlett could prevent the beginning of the war, or move away before it came to them, or something like that.<br/><br/>The acting is solid here, and I always love the comical timing and acting of Bill Nighy. This film won't change your life or affect it in significant ways, but some parts of it will maybe stay with you, and the honesty in the portrait of romantic couple and father/son intimacy is truly remarkable from Gleeson/McAdams and Gleeson/Nighy. <br/><br/>I trust Curtis, I always expect and know that he will always think about the structure of the film in terms of writing, and that means that he cares about storytelling conceived specifically for the screen, and I cherish that."

","This was a movie about using time travel for (mostly) the right reasons. On his 21st birthday, a British man learns the men in his family have the gift to travel through time-only to certain points in their own lifetimes, and when they clench their fists and concentrate in a dark, dank place. He decides to use this ""gift"" to find a girlfriend and concentrates on an American girl named Mary. He also uses it to fix awkward moments. After a stumbling block, he begins to succeed...<br/><br/>This is a good combination of comedy, drama, romance, and fantasy.

","This story has so much heart! The way the storyline was portrayed was perfect to me. I find it difficult to watch movies all the way through to the ending, but this one was different. I felt so many different emotions while watching this movie. I enjoyed seeing the love of two people form over time and felt a true connection to the characters. The heartbreak, the memories of their past, every little part of this movie spoke to my heart and made me reflect upon my own life. What I would have changed in my past, the birth of my own child, and my close relationship with my father. What would I have done differently if I was Tim? Everything about this movie was so beautiful and I still cry every time I watch it. This is the best movie I have seen in YEARS. I wish there were more like it."
"jazdkyna-na-pavucine","9","1","1","31 March 2016"," A surprisingly pleasant and impressive movie
","My colleague, a graduate of film studies, recommended this movie to me. We were talking about easy romantic comedies to fill up the breaks you need in between the hard, strong, meaningful movies. She described it as enjoyable, the adjective I remember. <br/><br/>I must warn you – it is about travelling in time. And travelling in time does two things over and over again. It gets complicated and confusing (do count that as one thing) and filmmakers usually love to incorporate hugely important matters into it. The first thing can get at best interesting and it gets the viewer's attention, or terribly wrong and the viewer vanishes into the air as if they were never there in the beginning (time travelling paradox pun intended). The second usually involves a death of a person or, better, the end of the world. Most usually not cool. <br/><br/>About time"", forgive me if I will not spare you of this, has both. There is a confusion about the exact rules of time travelling and sometimes about the time-line we're in. But the rules get explained soon enough, and they keep it quite simple – it is a romantic comedy after all. And the important events? Well, there is plenty, but the disaster movies wouldn't bet their money on any of them.<br/><br/>There were two main motivations of me seeing this movie. One Bill Nighy and one Bill Weasley and neither of them had let me down. Bill Nighy portrays a father of a family, a man of wisdom (gained most likely by time travelling), books (gained no doubt by time travelling) and kindness (hopefully by nature). He takes care of a family which is described utterly charmingly and leaves the viewer (at least as romantic and helplessly dreamy as I) wishing for those kinds of families to be true. It almost pains to leave the magical surroundings of an English country house to follow Domhnall Gleeson (the son) to London. But his performance does not fall far under Nighy's and it goes hand in hand with the quality of narration of the movie. The viewer is at times pleasantly surprised with unusual scenes (as the one in Dans Le noir? restaurant) and more than occasionally with satisfying dialogues (and I mean really satisfying, the kind you don't expect in romantic comedies). The makers, though, know that they have a strong material in hand when it comes to Tim's (the son's) family and not only do they visit it as the story progresses, but make it essential and even more likable with time. <br/><br/>I have to come back to the end of the world topic, and in this paragraph let there be spoilers, because it just needs to be done. In About time"", Tim uses the ability first time to get the love of his life, Margot Robbie to want him. He spends the whole summer on that job, and, what a surprise in a romantic comedy, doesn't succeed in the end. Another surprise is, there is no unnecessary drama about this. When he, happily in love with another woman, sees his first love after years, he almost gives in to her charm, but realizes in the last second where his heart lies and runs to ask Rachel McAdams to marry him. And here I must beg you to believe me when I say there is no superfluous drama in those scenes either, all the drama is well set in the humour and sweetness and simple straightness of it all. If there are scenes that make your heart skip a beat, or your eyes to shed a tear, they are not forced onto you rudely, but find their way through the lines of a beautifully boring life. <br/><br/>But guess what – life is about the boring things. The little things. Well, occasionally there is a big and amazing thing, but usually it's just an ordinary life. And this movie reminds you of that, in a funny, gloriously simple way that is completely free of cheesy. My colleague described it as enjoyable, and she was right. I, however, need to add some adjectives. It may have not been a hard movie, but it was strong and meaningful. I am going to enjoy tremendously the simple taste of my flavoured beer now, and you go and give this movie a chance."
"michelletanera","9","1","1","25 March 2016"," Bound To Feel Good Movie
","I think it is fair to say that About Time is a beautiful movie of a wonderous, tender, and maddeningly sweet love story. You are just bond to feel good about that.<br/><br/>As simple as it can be, we are naturally in love with the sincerity the movie offers from the beginning, and true to the message it carries, forgetting the time travel element by the end. Richard Curtis is doing just a fit, clean job in capturing every emotions in such a beautiful gesture that made About Time gracefully wonderful.<br/><br/>Tim Lake is such a endearing character that created Domnhall Gleeson a special place in my heart forever. We just love Tim and Mary, period. Because romantic dramas are lately doomed with a heartbreaking tragedy, undeniable hardship, and often someone's dying too early, About Time is lightly a more humble story of a man and a woman with enviable love. True that the pair is getting all the spotlight, but we can't fall for the family's love any less. Growing up in equally enviable family whom rule number one is to dwell on beauty of life, young Tim is having the same insecurities we all seem to have about the future, because he didn't feel good enough. Time travel is one extraordinary thing, but it is not too long, through trials and errors, before he realized that it doesn't help him any good unless he himself does something good. In the end of the day, time travel doesn't win Mary for him. As the story goes, it is just heartwarming to see how much wiser and maturer Tim got. He is madly in love with his Dad, Mum, and adorable sister Kit-Kat just as much as he is madly in love with Mary. Dad is a figure you wish you had in your life--someone you couldn't bare to say goodbye. We learned about how much a big kind love like that can give us, and how much a simplest act of love can give to even a stranger we meet on the street. The writing is beautiful. The casts are stunning. I missed the characters the moment the credits rolled and wished I had known them in my real life. I'd honestly like to thank Richard Curtis, because without trying to be exaggerating, I've learned life."
"sportsfan08","10","1","1","17 February 2016"," Surprisingly funny, well acted, and very thought provoking
","The idea of a romantic comedy movie where the lead character is able to travel back in time sounds kind of odd, but the production turned out to be excellent. <br/><br/>This movie provided me with so many fun laughs. The jokes in this movie were very funny, and not repetitive. The settings were also very beautiful, as I felt parts of London were displayed very well. One of the best parts of this movie without a doubt, is the acting. Domhall Gleason, who is now a powerhouse actor, landing roles in major productions such as 'Star Wars the force awakens'. 'The Revenant', and 'Brooklyn', played the role perfectly, right from facial expressions to body language. This for sure was one of the great performances that got his name out towards the public. Rachel McAdams also played the part of the lead actress very well, as she stayed well tuned to her character. Lastly, the overall symbolism and meaning in the movie was quite amazing. It is usually quite rare to find a great Rom-com, that has strong symbolism, but this movie hit both fronts almost perfectly. In conclusion, About Time is a feel good mod movie, fuelled by strong performances, and is likely to be enjoyed by several of the viewers who watch it."

","If you are looking to watch a feel good movie, without being too critical on the plot, you should definitely watch this film. Best of all, the accompanied soundtrack that goes along the show is awesome to say the least. All the songs fits perfectly and beautifully into each scenes. <br/><br/>The main gist of the show tells that ability to time travel to relive and right the wrongs of your life. This plot may be overly used in many films but it has slanted to a more family love - father's love mostly - directions which is not often seen in most travel-back-in-time movies. The protagonist of the show is a young men who learned from his father one day that the all men in the family have the ability to time travel. So went to the adventures of his time travels, which his main motivation at first is finding the love of his life. It is wonderfully played out when he manages to find the girl he love and using the time travel ability, going back in time to right any wrong, to ensure the ideal outcome. All is well at this moment in this movie - which had done real well focusing on his love life and then fatherhood life. Then his sister's misfortune came in and the strange explanations on the adverse effects of time travel to change some outcome does not really gel too well with the general flow of the film. The later part of the show - last 30 mins, seems to be losing the grip, but a meaningful ending with the father ensures a reasonable finish to the end. <br/><br/>Some hiccups for this movie, but the feel good factor persist throughout the movie, and I certainly did not regret watching this on a Saturday night, feeling good throughout the show."

It was refreshing to see time travel which is not all about saving the world or some extraordinary event But is used more to develop characters in their everyday lives. As such I found it gripping and moving. The casting was great Bill Nighy had great empathy and feeling and Domhnall Gleeson was a great choice of protagonist. The fact that he is not your average swashbuckling star made the plot all the more fascinating . Rachel MacAdams was just lovely and Lindsay Daveport was a true to life foil to Bill Nighy The supporting cast did a great job of filling it out. All in all a lovely movie worth watching many more times as so many of Ruchard Curtis' movies are."

Some of the acting leaves more to be desired. The dialog is light and fluffy, and nothing to get terribly lost in. Leaves you wanting to go out and hug your loved ones and enjoy each and every moment, which is what were supposed to be doing anyway? Film gets a bit convoluted at times and takes some left turns that I could have done without, however over all enjoyable. Don't go expecting an Oscar, but well done indeed."

","As a generally unemotional guy i couldn't help but be touched by this story. Not only beautiful in its execution, but its attention to the little things that translate the vulnerable and imperfect into the truly beautiful things they are, was captured as best I've ever seen. As for the cast, they were fantastic. Could not say enough about the immense chemistry between them all, not for a second did i doubt the love between the family and relationships portrayed. The film will have you questioning events missed and misplayed in your own life as well as creating an alertness that will likely carry some value knowing you will only get one shot at things and not to let the warning signs from those you love go ignored. A rare film, and i watch them all, so i say that with confidence, i'm sure you'll agree."

","When I saw the trailer, my first thought was ""Why is Rachel McAdams"" in another time traveler movie?! Second thought "" Why another time traveler movie?"". After the trailer the thoughts we're still the same, but with one detail ""This one seems funnier.."" It was seeing the score here, at IMDb that made me wonder if it would really be just another movie, same story, same characters, etc. . So I dared myself, I watched it and what a wonderful surprise. This movie is another romantic comedy. The foundations of the movie are the same as usual, the not so pretty, not so funny, not desired, on the contrary, dismissed boy meets shy girl that is much more than she thinks and they fall in love. But this only goes for half the movie. This half although manages to tell the very same story that we know but in a more intelligent way, making it more believable than usual. The second part, for me it's the masterpiece, it's where the big message rely. The movie becomes something more, grows like the character in it. It still tells the story of most people, but in the way that reminds all of our history, with a beautiful sensibility. This movie it's about a time traveler. In the beginning I found it impossible like any common human being. At the end we realize it isn't fiction, this ""time traveling"" we should all make, every day!"

There is no tension, no emotion. When there is an problem, it is immediately solved by traveling back in time.

But 2 hours :gasp: :yuk: please! About Time is lovely written, of course, every scene is charming, subtle and funny and just spot on, and the cast is just wonderful. But the whole story is a chore. Once Tim gets the love of his life, what do we care? Everything else looks tediously uninteresting, there is nothing left to fight for and the philosophical lesson, the Great Secret of Happiness is very long in the telling so you just want to get it over with.<br/><br/>In French we say that ""Happy people are not worth a story"" and that's exactly the point here: you just wish you won't have watch years and years in the life of a happy man who can go back in time and tweak every little detail he got wrong the first time, and with not real major downside. I guess this pretty soon gets boring to him as it got boring for Bill Murray in the Groundhog Day before he understand that love would be the meaning of life.<br/><br/>In About Time our 'hero' Tim is just a nice little boy, very clean, adorable and sweet upbringing (sure it is not a Ken Loach movie but soft and gentle Soap Opera, must we?): one plain boring nerd with a plain boring perfect cute love story he patches together. Groundhog Day was about a curse, not a fancy gift, and Bill Murray was an edgy and fascinating character indeed. Same starting point: great movie here, insufferable drivel there."
"h-english-329-216405","4","7","19","20 October 2013"," About Time - Film Review
","After a ten year absence from the rom-com genre, Richard Curtis must have thought; it's ""About Time"" I made another. Alas, ""About Time"" was made. The film stars Domhnal Gleeson, who fills the boots of Hugh Grant as Curtis' lead man, only to be accompanied by the always elegant Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>As one might imagine, the film is simply, about time. Domhnal Gleeson plays Tim – a pleasant, romance –obsessed young Englishman looking for love. Sadly, despite his best efforts, he struggles to find it. This is until his father (Bill Nighy) unveils the family secret that will change Tim's fortunes – That Tim can travel back in time.<br/><br/>What unfolds is a series of Groundhog-Day-like trips to the past, where Tim desperately tries to change his romantic loses. Tim's counter- clockwise visits create the bulk of the comedy, as he awkwardly tries to woo the beautiful Mary, played by Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>A light-hearted touch is maintained for the most part. As a result you have plenty of goofy characters pitching in along the ride whilst Gleeson tries to shape his life into an ideal mold. As the film leads to a more dramatic second half, Curtis induces thought provoking questions of life, as Tim discovers the many consequences that arise from changing his past. Curtis does well to avoid being overtly profound, achieving a delicate crescendo in tone as the film draws its meaning.<br/><br/>""About Time"" sweetly delivers its message by the conclusion. However despite Tim's love infused nature, the film tends to lag romantically. A potentially harmonious chemistry between McAdams and Gleeson is often side-lined for clockwork antics. Romance and time - if no longer unique - still remains a fun concept. However, ""About Time"" doesn't equate to time warped predecessors like Benjamin Button and Midnight in Paris."
"Soul4673","10","4","9","11 September 2013"," The greatest film I've seen in a long time
","I really don't know where to begin with this one. I usually write that I am a film student or that I'm 16 or that I saw this with my mum or my best friend or something along the lines of I am a film nerd but truthfully I think this films too good for my writing clichés. I have never in my life found a film SO emotionally engaging. I have never seen a film with characters SO relatable and SO believably amazing. It's just....wow.<br/><br/>OK where to begin? OK I'll start with Tim. Domhnall Gleeson is just perfect. He really his. His accent, his persona, his chemistry with Rachel McAdams, his relationship with his father and his sister and what he says about her at the beginning...that she is the most wonderful thing in the world and his hopeless romanticism as well as his disbelief when his father tells him about the time travelling. The thing that was so amazing about his character was how he just seemed...normal really. How he was extraordinary and funny and appreciative of everything but he was just so ordinary yet so different at the same time and I found him so relatable and beautiful....and just....wow. (that phrase will be used A LOT in this review) OK Tim's dad. (Bill Nighy) First of I LOVE Bill Nighy. He was stunning in this film....seriously flawless. His character was funny and inspiring and just....wow. How he tells Tim is just hilarious and how they play table tennis and oh! His speech at the wedding is just SO beautiful...it actually made me cry and when he dies and Tim has to say goodbye and Tim goes back and they go on the walk they did when he was a kid was just so beautiful...I'm actually crying writing this review. He really reminded me of my dad actually....competitive, funny, strange and undeniably insane yet thankful for every second of his life....that's what I want to be like.<br/><br/>The sister....Kit Kat, Katie, Kittle Kattle. Oh my gosh was she AMAZING! SERIOUSLY I LOVED her SO much...her character was charmingly funny and friendly and such a great person yet fell down some wrong paths...when she got hit by the car...I cried SO much. She was just...seriously hilarious yet so relatable and lovable. The film would definitely have not be the same without her.<br/><br/>I could just go on and on and on...I haven't even mentioned how beautiful Rachel McAdam's character was or how much I loved uncle Bernard who is quite A LOT like me or how AMAZING Richard Curtis is as a director but I'm going to end it here and say that this review REALLY does not do this incredibly inspiring, ore creating, extraordinary film which is now my favourite film EVER justice. I would rate this film a million out of 10 if I could....it's just beautiful and if you haven't seen it. See it. It really is flawless."

","Walking into the cinema with little knowledge about the film other than it had Rachael McAdams and Bill Nighy in it, It was sure to say i didn't know what i was expecting. However i was pleasantly surprised. The film starts of with Tom a 21 year old looking for love however having no success, his search however all changes when his farther Nighy tells him he can turn back time. He meets a charming woman McAdams and even though they start of a bit slowly everything eventually falls into place and they have a wonderful relationship. There are some twists and turmoils throughout which he tries to repeat however on some occasions fate has to take its course. I have saw Tim previously in a programme called Black mirror and instantly recognised him as i thought he was brilliant in that, Domhmall Gleeson is definitely a rising star in my eyes and he suited the role perfectly. This is a film which is going to be up there with Notting Hill and Love Actually as it's original story, brilliant cast and directing are all fantastic. Great film for a date night and a must see film all round. 8/10"

This film might go over some critics heads as they will probably be looking very closely to find a flaw and miss the lovely flow and small moments of magic. Well done Mr Curtis. I look forward to seeing your next film and hope it comes soon.I will be recommending this one to all my friends and probably look to buy a copy on DVD.

I am so pleased I agreed to see it, it is quite possibly one of my favorite movies and one I know i will watch over and over.<br/><br/>Having watched all of Richard's movies, I have to say he has really outdone himself. The script is refreshingly original and executed perfectly. Although the film is supernatural (not sure if this is considered a spoiler) in the sense that the main protagonist can travel through time, the movie it self is about the everyday struggles of life and how this unique gift helps Tim, often in hilarious ways. It especially tugs on my heart strings because of the relationship Tim has with his father.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 10 out of 10 because i honestly could not think of a single fault, even down to the soundtrack which lifts you up just at the right places and then utterly devastates you later.

"Smartgirl1481095","10","3","6","14 November 2013"," Best Movie I've seen in a long time
","""About time"" is a romantic comedy starring Rachel McAdams and Domhnall Gleeson. This movie is great, heartfelt, and funny. Despite being somewhat long and kind of dragging the plot out, the message and the storyline makes it worthwhile. Even though it was somewhat predictable with the guy star getting the girl star, it was refreshing to see that it did not take the whole film for him to woo and get her like in most romantic comedies. They become a couple fairly quickly which I loved, the film is basically about their journey as a couple and him using his time traveling ability to change fairly minor details like the first time they have sex which wasn't that great so he went back in time twice doing much better each time. He goes back in time later in the film to try to help his sister get her life together after she gets in a terrible accident but when he comes back, he has a different child so he realizes he can't save her that way. McAdams and Gleeson were great for this part and they had such a believable, amazing connection, you can really see and feel the connection between them. It has a great superb energy that despite being long is a great interesting watch. It was the best $10.00 I ever spent. It is such a feel good movie that it captivates the audience from start to finish. It is so good that everyone; men, women, children and the elderly could all enjoy it. This film is witty, charming and full of clever, charming jokes. It is definitely one of the best romantic comedies of the year. It's a movie that acknowledges that life is messy and it sometimes isn't going to play out the way you want it to, but it also stops to see its beauty. ""About Time"" is a beautiful film to watch. It is sometimes a little rough and somewhat long winded, but those are small when compared to the joy and message that embraces them."
"vdreyzin","8","3","6","11 November 2013"," A beautiful heartwarming romantic film with a very deep life lesson
","My wife and I went to see this film hoping for a lighthearted romantic date flick. One reviewer called this movie a chick flick for men. Although on the surface this may be one characterization, this film is so so much more than a simple date movie or chick flick for men or women. Neither is this a sci-fi movie as some have described, although some aspects can definitely be described as magical. <br/><br/>At the root, this film's message is living life to the fullest. Trying to always live life in the moment. Enjoying the simple things in life, like seeing your children growing up, sipping tea with your loved ones at the beach, or buying a sandwich at the local store during a lunch break at work. The film reminds us that much of our lives are spent worrying about what has happened in the past and what could happen in the future, and that much of this worry will never come to be and ends up being just lost time and wasted emotions. As much as we may want to relive certain experiences in our lives, we can only experience each moment once. There are no second chances. This moment is all we have, and we must make the best of it.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is terrific and lovely in this film. She is real and authentic and her performance is wonderfully sincere.<br/><br/>This film should not be reserved for a date night. It should be seen by parents, grandparents and adult children. We all need to be reminded about what is really important in life, and this film does just that. It will leave you inspired, awed and reawakened. Enjoy!"
"lucasnochez","9","3","6","11 November 2013"," Review: About Time Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","If you were able to travel back in time to the past events of your life, what exactly would you change? In Richard Curtis' new time-travelling romantic-comedy, Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) decides to go back and change his life, all in the name of love. Not that he could really go back and 'kill Hitler or shag Helen of Troy', as his father suggests.<br/><br/>Since the early 2000′s, the British romantic-comedy is becoming as much of a staple in the genre than any piece of American rom-com cinema has recently, disregarding the American romantic indie features. Whether it be the cute accents, the ginger-bred protagonists or the intricate unique narrative tropes which excel certain points of the love story, those British buggers are succeeding in a genre that generally lacks such a large emotional response in big- budgeted Hollywood films.<br/><br/>In the film, aspiring law student Tim lives with his parents (played eloquently by Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan), his free-spirited sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) and Uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery) in a charming home overlooking the bay in Cornwall, England. On the morning of Tim's twenty-first birthday, he is summoned to his father's study only to be told that the men in his family have the amazing ability to travel back in time, within the timeline of their own lives of course. In utter disbelief and against his will, Tim follows his fathers instructions; finds a dark place, clenches his fists and thinks back to New Years Eve, only to rectify his mistake of missing out on kissing a beautiful girl at the stroke of midnight. Enchanted, he returns to his father exclaiming, ""It's going to be a complicated year"", where his father replies, ""it's going to be a complicated life"".<br/><br/>About Time is a charming, utterly tender tale of life, love and the extraordinary of the ordinary. Much like the narrative of the film, Tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life, yet the film is anything but perfect, and that's OK. Suffering from inconsistent plot-points to breaking the rules that the film outlines, About Time is surely not a tightly-constricted narrative leap for the genre by any means. Regardless, the film casts an enchanting spell that not only lifts one's spirit, but causes you to merely forget about the rules Curtis makes, and breaks.<br/><br/>Writer/director Richard Curtis has had quite a bit of luck in the romantic-comedy genre, making major waves penning Bridget Jones's Diary, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Although he has stated that About Time will be his final directorial venture, only behind the aforementioned Love Actually and Pirate Radio, Curtis has succeeded well beyond many of the directors and screenwriters who hoped to successfully recreate anything Nicholas Sparks' has made, with the exception of The Notebook, of course. Fresh, spontaneous and demanding emotions, Curtis has brought new light to the British romantic-comedy front and has made the kind of films one isn't ashamed to laugh and cry at.<br/><br/>Once Tim finally meets Mary (Rachael McAdams), Tim knows he has found the reason to adequately use his time-travelling powers. At first glance, Gleeson and McAdams seem like a poor physical match for a film that at times could be distracting or awkward. Instead, much to the extent and reality in life, the two feed off one another's unique characteristics splendidly. Tall, pale and with a hint of orange hair, Gleeson's unique on-screen charm is brashly alluring. McAdams on the other hand, stripped of all glam and instead substituted with a rather rag/tag girl-next door look, reminds us why she is cast in these roles and how easy it is to fall in love with her – quirks and all.<br/><br/>McAdams, who is no stranger to the time-travelling love story narrative, venturing in her third quest as the desired love interest, first in the Time Traveler's Wife and two years later in Woody Allen's acclaimed Midnight In Paris, enchants and reminds us just how adorable and likable she really is in these roles. Bringing a believable essence to the role of Mary, McAdams just may cement herself in time as the go-to, romantic-comedy poster girl.<br/><br/>As a love story, About Time succeeds. As a tale of morality, a lesson on making each day your last and as a film about the bond between father and son, the film triumphs. Gleeson and Nighy share some of the most sentimental and heart-wrenching moments of the film that are sure to get your eyeballs sweating with joy. Incandescent as father and son, the two actors shine as the heart and soul of the film.<br/><br/>As the pendulum swings closer to the end of the year, About Time will surely be atop my list of guilty cinematic pleasures of 2013, especially since I am such a sucker for hopeless romantic love stories with an underlining patriarchal theme. About Time may be a highly decorated cautionary tale of the beautiful moments in everyone's seemingly mundane life and the short time we have to live it, but the film, whether romantically tied or generationally suggestive, is a movie about appreciating the little things. ""Some days you want to re-live forever. Some days you want to live once"", and Richard Curtis and company really hammer that notion home with their newest film. Essentially, About Time is really all ABOUT LOVE, and we are alright with that.<br/><br/>Night Film Reviews: 9/10 Stars"

Both of these films put thoughtful and creative new spins on time travel, which is necessary when the majority of the films made in this genre lack coherence and internal consistency. While there may be a point or two to quibble over regarding ABOUT TIME (my main sticking point being the mid-movie appearance of ""Boy Posy""--undoing that snafu seems like closing the barn door after the livestock has escaped; it's generally tougher to push toothpaste back into the tube), the excellence of the acting performances tends to smooth over any such rough patches. Long-time British A-lister Brendan Gleeson's son Domhnall is a revelation in the lead role of Tim, and Bill Nighy (he of the octopus beard in the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchise) looks more like a screen-match dad for Tim than Brendan would have been, plus he pulls his role off with a level of tenderness not seen in most of the screen parts played by Domhnall's real-life father (frequently cast as a ""heavy"").

Oh, how wrong I was.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson (Tim) added some humor to the movie, but I credit most of it to Bill Nighy (Dad) and Richard Cordery (Uncle D). However, I warn you to bring tissues with you if you have any heart at all. The same characters that makes you laugh will also make you cry. Then laugh again. Then cry again.

"Paddy-49","4","9","30","24 September 2013"," Return to Curtisland - with mixed results
","Those of us who are partial to ""Curtisland"" have had to wait ten years for the next instalment – ""Love Actually"" (2003) was the last film in the genre. Curtisland is that corner of Middle England inhabited (mostly) by twenty-something upper-middle class people who live somewhat unreal lives mostly as a member of a group of bright (mostly) attractive (usually) louche (sometimes) and funny (consciously or unconsciously) friends. It first appeared in the 1994 hit film ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and again in ""Notting Hill"" (1999) and ""Love Actually"". It also featured strongly in ""Bridget Jones Diary"" (2001) and its successor Bridget Jones – The Edge of Reason (2004). <br/><br/>The films of Curtisland are entertainment and often make us laugh out loud – at least the first three did. The main accusation thrown at Curtis is that the films are sentimental. Sentimentality is a pretty subjective concept. The American author Mitch Albom said ""Critics have a problem with sentimentality. Readers do not. I write for readers."" I don't know whether Richard Curtis would agree with this but I suspect that he might! And with Graham Greene who said that ""Sentimentality – that's what we call the sentiment we don't share.""<br/><br/>Which brings me to ""About Time"". Yes it is an extremely sentimental film but the RomCom bit is actually fairly unsentimental and rather good. Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) , a ginger-headed Brit, falls for Mary (Rachel McAdams) , a seriously pretty American who falls for him. They get it together and get married and have babies. That to do this Tim has to use a facility to travel back in time (he gets in a dark cupboard and clenches his fists to do this) to earlier moments in his own life is endearing and allows for some amusingly restructured moments. Not least when he travels back to rescue Mary from a jerk of a boyfriend by ensuring that they don't even meet! The meeting, falling in love, marriage and baby-making of Tim and Mary happens fairly quickly – in a two hour film it occupies most of the first half hour and not much more. The film is a paean to parenthood. There are two equally sentimental aspects to this. The first is the relationship between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy). The second is the baby-making and delights of parenting that Tim and Mary share. Nighy, as ever, plays himself very well. He's the sort of father who doesn't effuse with touchy-feelyness. But gradually as the film progresses and as he brushes, losingly, with mortality he feels the need to tell his son he loves him (etc. etc.). Poor old Mum (nicely played by an under-used Lindsay Duncan) doesn't get much of a look in.<br/><br/>But what of the parenting of Tim and Mary? This takes up a lot of screen time. Here they really do run the gamut of emotions from A to B. I cannot recall a film I've seen with so much gratuitous baby business in them. Now I must reveal a bias here. Baby stuff is a sentiment I certainly don't share. No doubt others in the packed cinemas that are watching ""About Time"" around the world will not agree with me and Curtis is being very clever in giving this sentiment a free run. If we combine the Father/Son story and the Baby-making story together under the general ""paean to parenthood theme"" this is, as I say, what most of the film is about. And if that's your thing you'll no doubt love it. I rather sank in my seat as it went on.<br/><br/>Far better for me was the theme illustrated by some time travel moments of living as fully as possible every day. Tim sums it up: ""I try to live every day as if it were the final day of my extraordinary, ordinary life,"" There is one excellent sequence when Tim goes through a day without laughing or smiling much. Too busy to notice as individuals the people around him. Then he decides to reprise the day with time travel and this time he makes an effort to relate.<br/><br/>Surrounding the main characters in Curtisland there are always secondary characters who bumble through the film – often making one major comic turn along the way. In ""About Time"" there is Tim's batty sister (as in Notting Hill) Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) who is rather more than batty actually and nearly dies as a result of a drunken car crash at one point. She is rescued by Tim and Mary because she is lovable really and just needs a good man, rather than a rat, to save her. The good man is another member of the Ginger Tribe (Tim is Ginger) Jay (Will Merrick) and in the end they have settled down together and they have a baby. No surprise there then! Then there is the role usually played by Rowan Atkinson of the strange eccentric. Tom Hollander got the part of the foul-mouthed boozy playwright Harry. I thought that this was a very funny portrayal – a man so unpleasant you feel he must have graduated with a PhD in nastiness.<br/><br/>This is a two-hour film and is I would suggest at least half-an-hour too long. The story of the accident to Kit Kat just goes on and on – that's the trouble with time travel life tends to repeat itself. There are also some plot inconsistencies and tricks which make little sense. Would I recommend it – perhaps not if you aren't into babies and slushy father/son scenes. On the other hand Rachel McAdams is absolutely lovely as well as being a very good actor.<br/><br/>If you think that you might ""share the sentiment"" then go along to ""About Time"". If you think that you might not - but you go anyway – you might need to shut your eyes a bit at times!"

","I was invited for a screening today and mostly went because Rachel Mcadams is Beautiful. Well firstly I'm not into British Movie and this one didn't help to change my mind. <br/><br/>The script was the problem really. The dialogue are really good but the story is not proportional. First it's a love story about a guy who find his love, then you have to forget about it and focus only on the dad and then once you think it s finally going to be over you realise that it's actually going to be a lifetime story of a man, rushed near the end. The girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) is kind of the heart of the movie in the first part, then she's nonexistent in the second half. Why so much built up in a character to just not use it later? She literally sleep in all her scenes. All the part with the dad is quite good, thank to a very good acting from Bill Nighy (the dad).<br/><br/>The main actor is not likable as well, unless you fancy skinny ginger hair. The non nice looking guy who got only the hot girls... I m sorry, was I watching an American movie? No.<br/><br/>The idea had a very good potential but I guess the screenwriter got a bit too existed in the message he tried to delivered.<br/><br/>So my 5 is only for the dialogues and Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>So go see this movie if you like Bill Nighy because he's really worth it in it, otherwise don't bother, just wait it air on ITV with the weather and news in the middle of the film."

","Apparently time travels are one of the keys to success because this movie hit me right in my heart. ""About Time"" touched me in way that no movie has ever touch. A simple story about love that has enough strength to make everyone laugh and cry. The story of a guy who is unhappy with is life and who discovers a very powerfully gift which will transform his life forever. It's really hard to say bad things about this film, the characters, the story, the soundtrack and all the details were really good. Perhaps the best romantic comedy I have ever seen, ""About Time"" accomplishes everything I love about romantic comedies, it's a compassionate, magical and lovely story with a little bit of comedy.

","The spoiler is at the front of this review: If you think this is a film about time travel, then please don't go and see this film. Just take a copy of 'Star Trek' or something and lock yourself in a closet (hint).<br/><br/>However... if you can come out of the closet a reformed character if you have any kind of soul or a heart. You simply HAVE to see this movie. Again, I have to thank my darling wife (as per my last review) as I thought I would never have wanted to see this film... though I saw the trailer and was a little intrigued.<br/><br/>The trailer actually though doesn't give you even a tenth of this movie's depth or emotional content and if you want to have a good cry at any point then do so... but I defy you not to shed a tear at the end. I'm writing this review whilst listening to Mark Kermode's parallel take on the film via YouTube and cannot help but concur - and he cried too - for all the right reasons this film works and on lots and lots of levels.<br/><br/>Firstly though - is it a chick film or is it in that cadre alongside 'Field of Dreams' where actually its a male tale? I think definitely the latter but either sex will be certain to claim it as one of their own and the parallels are already starting to appear on the internet. It may not have yet the cult status of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' but frighteningly that film was made almost twenty years ago and the world has moved on. I think 'About Time' is every bit as good, if not better, than 'Four Weddings' and I think (and hope) over time people will stop making that comparison and respect it for being something quite different and arguably more subtle, indeed a little darker.<br/><br/>Secondly, the current comparator on the Wiki page is 'Groundhog Day'. Yes, there are similar themes and tropes in 'About Time' but you will warm to the lead characters in 'About Time' far more than you will ever do to Bill Murray and his amusing but acerbic humour. So I don't think that this is anything like 'Groundhog' (or '50 First Dates', which is 'Groundhog Day' but sweeter in my view) in that sense and plays... dare I say... much better and a fair bit deeper.<br/><br/>Third, some critics say the film is more like 'The Time Traveller's Wife'. I caught that for the first time only last week and was less-than-impressed... the story was good but the film itself just left you feeling like an observer on the outside of a physics experiment. For me, 'About Time' is very different and a far better movie.<br/><br/>The difference: you cannot help but to be drawn into the world that surrounds these characters as its real. ever day stuff - late teen angst; first (and second) loves; marriage, romance, children and sadly also death. It doesn't get much more 'real' than that.<br/><br/>Now apparently this film has opened in the UK first and doesn't hit the US until the start of November. The size of the 'real' box office take will only be known once its passed through the US and this is a quintessentially British film after all. It has Bill Nighy (again as suggested by Mark Kermode) playing a character playing a character playing Bill Nighy, through Lindsay Duncan and what seems to be a cast of really great up-and-coming British actors and actresses (Rachel MacAdams excepted). So whether they will 'get' it over the pond remains to be seen...<br/><br/>...but that doesn't mean its not a wonderful film and if you only get to see one more film this year, make it this one.<br/><br/>I saw 'Four Weddings' with a (then) girlfriend and walked out from the cinema knowing that we didn't have the romance that was needed to make it all the way. Its taken me twenty years, as I said, but I came out tonight having watched the film with someone who makes me feel like the final words of the film suggest and also that the title, 'About Time' can be taken in many, many ways...<br/><br/>...maybe it was about time Richard Curtis did something better than 'Four Weddings' and for me, this is it. Please see it and make it the hit it deserves to be."

","We went with free passes and had no idea what this movie was really about and quite low expectations to be honest. I highly doubt I would have seen it if I had just based it on the trailer however, it was the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was certainly a mix of comedy and drama but not the type of predictable sappy love story that are typical of these type of movies. The story follows a young man who discovers that he has the ability to travel back in his life. He ends up changing some things about his life to make them just right however, in the end there are some things he isn't capable of changing. More than the time-travel theme is a beautiful portrayal of love at first sight, family bonds and the powerful connection between father and son. It is touching and sentimental and gives an honest perspective about living life to its fullest each and every day-with lots of humour included as well. It's not just a ""chick flick"" but something that I think guys will equally appreciate. Don't miss this movie. And bring your tissue!"

"ManchesterMatthew","2","4","11","28 June 2018"," Horrible
","I'm amazed this film has garnered as many high scores as it has, because it fails as a romance and fails in its time-travel premise.<br/><br/>Time-travel rarely works well in anything and the viewer often has to not think too hard and just go with it, but the mechanics this film chooses to use simply don't make sense. <br/><br/>If he went back in time into the mind of his younger self, okay, I could have bought it (as in The Butterfly Effect). But for his time-travelling self to appear, as a separate entity, in a wardrobe or other space makes no sense. <br/><br/>What's supposed to have happened to the ""original him"" in the time he travels back to? For example, he goes back to the New Year's party first thing. What if at the point he travels back he was in a crowded room. What happens to him? That ""him"" just pops out of existence and suddenly he comes downstairs from the cupboard like a bad magician on a talent show? <br/><br/>And when he goes back in the cupboard to travel back? Then what? Where's the rest of ""him"" from the time he just left? Waking up in a cupboard wondering how he got there?<br/><br/>It. Makes. No. Sense. <br/><br/>And romance? Don't make me laugh. It's so creepy to think he went back to his love-of-his-life's apartment for the first time, their ""first time"" together happens three times for him but only once for her. So what she thinks was their first time was his third time they'd done the deed? This doesn't strike anyone as disturbing? <br/><br/>And he lies and manipulates those closest to him all his life, changing things to suit him and only him? How romantic!<br/><br/>Oh but wait - he does suddenly try to take his sister back - succeeds - but then because it alters HIS life in a way he doesn't like (though dramatically altering hers) - nah, forget that, sis, go get hit by a car - you brought it all on yourself anyway! Not having you upsetting my perfect idyl!<br/><br/>A horrible film and a nonsense concept. I wish I could go back in time and never watch this garbage again."

I am a science fiction/time-travel and event coherence genre fan and I would like to say that I really liked this movie a lot. The acting cast were amazing and handling of scenes was perfect as there are no wasted moments and when I feel that there are extra scenes that serve no purpose to understand this movie, I get melted with these moments that build up the emotional connection.<br/><br/>One of the best romantic time-travel involved movies.

How easy it is to be fooled and not live our lives to the fullest. It's a story of a dad confessing to his son the meaning of life and the secret of happiness. This movie is so romantic like ""love actually"", funnier than ""four weddings and a funeral"" and so much more. I certainly put it in my top five list of best movies. In the end I was so touched, ready to cry. Concluding, i believe there should be more movies like that, since they are a brilliant example of the impact a movie can have in ones life."

"Jerghal","7","2","4","5 January 2014"," An entertaining can of worms
","Making a film about time-traveling is opening a can of worms. I've seen almost every film out there about time travel: some are very accurate and some are a complete mess. This one is somewhere in between. They introduce the concept very casually to the characters in the film who aren't smart enough to ask certain questions about the rules concerning the consequences and changes it might cause...I get that this movie is first and foremost a romantic movie and time travel is only a device to prove a point but at the same time it can be a bit distracting if it doesn't work 100%. In the first half of the film the protagonist comes of as a bumbling idiot who unrightfully uses time travel to correct his impulsive mistakes, which would have been easily corrected if he just used his brain before speaking. It seems questionable in that way if he even deserves to have this power to force 'things' to go his way. Domhnall Gleeson is maybe not the best choice of actor here, Rachel McAdams does a much better job, she is instantly likable but her character seems to be written without much depth. It might seem like a bad movie judging but my rant here but actually if you look past the aforementioned shortcomings it is entertaining and the 2 hrs will fly by in no time."

This movie didn't make me cry, it didn't make me angry, and it didn't leave me wondering, but it most certainly made me genuinely smile. The story gathers in so many aspects of life and presents them in a way in which we can plainly see and understand the message. It doesn't waste time in the complexities of time travel, but rather focuses on the importance of the lesson. This film has a love story with the quirkiness of a Wes Anderson film mixed with the serendipity of ""500 Days of Summer."" Just when it feels complete, it morphs out of love, right into family, tragedy, and all the rest of life's challenges and gifts. I believe this movie truly encompasses what we should look for for ourselves in everyday life and reaches to exceed the superficiality of most stories we encounter today."

The movie centres on the character Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) who is awkward, lacking in confidence but absolutely adorable to those who allow him to get too close to them. Tim discovers that he can time travel when he turns twenty-one and begins what he calls an ""extraordinary ordinary life"". The film is beautiful, funny and heartbreakingly honest. Gleeson is irresistible in his portrayal of Tim but Billy Nighy who plays Tim's Dad is also outstanding.

"hkauteur","9","2","4","22 October 2013"," HK Auteur Review - About Time
","As a story that involves time travel, About Time doesn't even follow it's established time travel rules. The most impressive part of it is, the movie is so charming with human warmth, none of that even matters.<br/><br/>I found myself not even caring about the broken rules. In fact, to be honest, I was so charmed and immersed into the story and characters I did not notice the rules were broken long after the movie was over. Plot hole zealots will have a ball nitpicking this film to oblivion but those who do will completely miss the film's point. Curtis' interest doesn't lie in science fiction spectacle; the time travel explanation itself is as unscientific as it gets.<br/><br/>Curtis' priorities lie upon human matters, which brings me to the characters. The film is well casted. As a romantic lead, Domhall Gleeson has an everyman quality that believably would have struggles dating women. That's a common complaint I have with a lot of romantic comedies generally. Glesson seems like a normal bloke whose charm needs time to grow on someone as opposed to being immediately charming with practiced swagger. Rachel McAdams is adorable and shows good comic timing. She's played a similar role before in Morning Glory, which was one of my favorites that year. Again, unlike a lot of romance stories, McAdams' allure doesn't hang solely on her beauty. The Mary character is smart, funny and an interesting person. More importantly, she is the type of the girl one would marry and take home to your parents.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy is Curtis's secret ingredient and is the heart of the film. It's a subtle minimalist performance, as if Nighy played the scenes as honestly as he could without adding any character quirks or anything an actor would do to purposely chew up the scenery. Nighy is an amicable presence, is effortlessly hilarious with his deliveries and inflections of every piece of dialogue he's given.<br/><br/>There's also a great cast of supporting characters that cover a variety of character quirks that I don't even want to spoil here. They all have their little arcs and I think it's probably a better experience to discover them while you're watching the film.<br/><br/>The main point is that Richard Curtis used time traveling as a metaphor to say something profound about life. He captures moments of life's joy and sadness. In doing so, the film is more than the sum of its parts. I was warmed by Curtis' optimistic view of life and the sincere message he conveyed in About Time. For a guy that doesn't cry at movies, I can say that other people will by the film's end. Heck, I probably would have enjoyed it more if I could roll a tear.<br/><br/>This is probably the one of the best movies I have seen this year. If it doesn't stay on my top ten by the end of 2013, it would be very surprising.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"
"steveandlesleykelly","9","2","4","18 September 2013"," Deeper than the average romantic comedy
","Curtis goes out with a bang with this highly witty creation. His usual formula remains well intact - middle class families, personality winning out over good looks, vulnerable friend or relative, slightly bumbling delivery, weddings, funerals and several laugh out loud moments,<br/><br/>I initially thought the time travel bit, being the key to the movie, would be the bit that disappointed me, but it didn't. A better description, which no other review I have spotted mentioned, is that it is as though the soul or the mind transports back in time, into the body that was there already - hence why he cannot change history (he could though, just not history he wasn't alive to see). The flaw in this argument is that the body in the past seems to suddenly move into a cupboard, but this is a flaw in the script, not in his concept of how the time travel bit is meant to work.<br/><br/>The only bit that didn't sit easy was the way it came across that he was stalking or manipulating the women to ensure they melted into his arms. Overhear a friend talking, go back in time, then pretend you are interested in the same thing. The whole resulting relationship would be based on a lie, which didn't sit easy.<br/><br/>There were two saving graces to this. One, is that the hero was portrayed as fundamentally decent and respectable, despite the above time travel voyeurism. Two, is that the resulting relationship originally resulted from a meeting not involving time travel - a literal blind date. He was thus only correcting what he had inadvertently messed up in the first place.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie, with some great philosophical messages relevant even to those of us without a quantum engine built into our bodies. Watch it. Because there won't be another one - unless Curtis himself goes back in time and changes his mind."

Tom Hollander plays Harry, a old acquaintance of Tim's Father and play writer who reluctantly gives Tim a room in his house while he's living in London after moving from his family home in Cornwall . Lydia Wilson plays Tim's Sister, Kit Kat who has a close bond with her Brother. Rachael Mc Adams plays Mary, Tim's girlfriend who he meets in the Dans Le Noir, a restaurant where people eat in the dark. Lindsay Duncan who plays Tim's Mother is talent wasted and is constantly a spare part. <br/><br/>'About Time' provides charming humour and like Curtis's previous works is a film about love and family but also the relationship of a Father and Son which will send everyone who watches it on a emotional roller coaster of what we all call life."
"aliceli314","7","2","4","15 September 2013"," Too sugary
","I am a massive fan of Love Actually and I like Four Weddings and a Funeral, so my expectations are quite high for Curtis' latest work. Perhaps this is why I was a little bit disappointed.<br/><br/>It seems that the main character Tim was living in a rather perfect world: loving and harmonious family; happy childhood; nice job; beautiful wife; 3 adorable kids; almost trouble- and worry-free (sister Kit Kat's problem was easily fixed and a man was ready and around for her).... He did not quite need to struggle for anything in life, everything was just so smooth and too good to be true. <br/><br/>Quite a lot of lines are well written. But to a fan of Richard Curtis, certain conversations can be quite typical, expected and sometimes rather cheesy."

","This film is definitely going into my top films. The things i loved about the film was the emotion put into it that the characters gave and portrayed excellently. The story for me was great and it would touch anyone who saw it. This is a really funny film as well as giving soft emotions. When i first saw the trailer the film looked good, when i watched it it was excellent. Zooey Deschanel was meant to be playing the role of the main character which i think she wouldve done great in but Rachel McAdams was just the best choice for this. I love her because shes just a brilliant actor. There was one thing that didn't really make it interesting was there was no climax to the film until the end when he had to make that sacrifice for a new child or his father. That bit was really sad and emotional having to tell his dad that that would be the last time ever to see him. It was such a great film and you should recommend this to all your friends."

","There's a lot to like about this movie. It has a slightly nostalgic feel to it whilst still being very current. The protagonist's family are quirky, idiosyncratic, and all dote on each other. There's a batty old uncle, an academic yet devoted father, an independent yet loving mother, a brother and sister who never fight but adore each other, halcyon days spent growing up in a crumbling old mansion house in Cornwall, picnicking on the beach in all weathers... then the boy turns 21 and discovers at a New Year party that the men in the family all have the ability to travel back in time. Cue some hilarious moments in which the boy dots back and forth in time, revisiting moments he didn't quite get right the first time so that he can have another crack at them. He marries, has a baby daughter, and then his sister is badly hurt in a car accident. Back in time he pops, and the accident never happens. However, when he returns to present time, his baby daughter has transformed into a baby son, because it seems that when you alter something in the past you get a different future. Deciding he can't live without his precious daughter, he goes back AGAIN and makes the accident happen. His sister has to go through the pain of rehabilitation, which of course she does, with her brother's support. Then the boy's father develops cancer. Needless to say, he's been time travelling for years, extending his own life, effectively, but now he's ready to die. But that's cool, because the son can keep travelling back in time to see him whenever he wants. However, after the father's funeral, the son's wife says she wants another baby. The son realises if they do this then he'll have to choose between seeing his father and risking the baby changing into someone else. He chooses the baby, and goes back to visit his father one last time. The two of them have a 'golden day' revisiting a walk they'd taken when the son was about ten, down on the beach, then say their goodbyes. The film ends with the son realising you have to live in the moment instead of worrying about time travel. What disappointed me about the film was the lack of dramatic tension. Even the whole father/son dilemma was more poignant than stressful, and there was never really a point where I felt, yikes, what will he choose to do? Had the sister been killed in that car crash, and the protagonist had to choose between saving his sister's life and keeping the same baby he and his wife had, I can't help feeling it would have carried a bit more weight. It's hard to believe this came from the same stable as 'Love Actually', where we had plenty of tragedy along with the comedy - the guy who was in love with his best friend's wife, the sister with the institutionalised brother who wasn't free to fall in love, the wife with the erstwhile philandering husband... All in all, just a bit too saccharine-sweet for my taste."

","It's one of those movies which will make you feel good for quite some time even after you watched it . The story itself is whole and complete and that is quite important for a movie to shine . Every Element of this movie is perfectly balanced.The cast did a pretty good job too of bringing out all the emotions possible out of the story . The plot revolves around the protagonist Tim Lake who suddenly discovers at the age of 21 that he can control Time . With his newly discovered power he decides to take a shot at love but fails miserably . Tim learns the hard truth that love is natural and cannot be controlled by any means . Years Pass away and Tim pursues a career at law . He meets the love of his life Mary and this time it sticks . The rest of the story revolves around their whole relationship and marriage and the problems the face along way with Tim trying his time manipulation powers to fix every situation. The main focus of the film is about love and family so don't get worried about the time travel too much ! The time travel element fits perfectly though and adds up some really great comic scenes . Overall its an amazing film and one of the best Romantic Dramas out there . Worth watching with your significant others if you plan to ."

","Normally I'm wary of romcoms. But this movie genuinely surprised me.<br/><br/>About Time is a rom-com that asks the simple question ""if you had the ability to time travel, what would you do?"" This simple premise is given with no complex explanation and the rest of the story follows.<br/><br/>The movie starts off a bit cheesy and predictable but goes through a series of twists and turns.<br/><br/>There's a ton of real heartfelt moments that the main character, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) shares with every major character of the film. Domhnall Gleeson also does a convincing role as the awkward English boy a bit too well. Bill Nighy does an above-and-beyond performance as a Dad and the father-son chemistry with Domhnall feels genuine.<br/><br/>Themes covered in this film showcase the value of relationships in one's life and how major decisions can shift the direction of one's life.<br/><br/>The film is about two hours but it feels much longer than that, in a good way. This film is sentimental and beautiful. I normally don't do sentimental films, but this film had me feeling some type of way.<br/><br/>4.5/5. Be warned, you may find yourself hiding in your closet, clenching your first, trying to go back in time. It's definitely worth a watch with a loved one."

","About Time is a masterful film, with so much heart and an incredibly important message at the centre of it. It takes a while for this message to become apparent, but a shift happens part way through the third act which reveals it, and it added so much weight to an already powerful film.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams are the two leads here, and their chemistry is undeniable. Both of the actors are amazing, and the characters they portray are realistic and believable. I also enjoyed Bill Nighy, and he was the main catalyst that drove the narrative forward at the beginning.<br/><br/>Time travel is involved heavily in this film, although not quite as much as I thought it would be. This usually brings about a number of logic problems. These definitely are present in About Time, but this might be the best use of time travel that I have ever seen. I'm not saying that the film on the whole competes with something like Back to the Future, but there aren't as many question marks raised here because it's a lot simpler and I enjoyed it on that level.<br/><br/>That being said, apart from a few pacing issues, I absolutely loved the story that we went on with these characters from beginning to end, and I couldn't get enough. It is also extremely funny, and a couple of scenes had me laughing out loud. The soundtrack and score are both incredible, and adds a lot to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, About Time isn't a perfect film, but it's absolutely loaded with charm and comes very close to being perfect. It's definitely one of the most underrated films of the past few years, and I encourage everyone to check it out.<br/><br/>SCORE: 92%"

","An absolutely delightful and wonderfully original romantic comedy, that is very part enjoyable as it is sweet. About Time does something that many films of its kind are often too afraid of doing, that being, taking full advantage of its interesting concept and making you believe in it. Domhnall Gleeson is perfect is the leading role, with Rachel McAdams, Bill Nighy, and Lydia Wilson providing perfect supporting roles. This film simply has it all. It may not go drastically deep into the soul as some great movies do, but it goes deeper into the heart than most, and the result is utterly beautiful. The script is not just funny, but honest, and revealing, and by all means entertaining. Richard Curtis provides the film with some great direction, and the cinematography can also often be stunning. In the end, About Time is almost too good to be true. It's everything rom-com enthusiasts will ever want, and one of the most delightful and heartfelt feel good movies I have ever seen.

The movie up to that point was already unbelievable but this lesson hits me right in the heart and although I ""know"" it wouldn't do the same to my wife. I turn to her to see if she's at least smiling, but as I turn to her she discreetly starts to turn away from me.

The plot is quite interesting and makes for quite a good story.<br/><br/>There were a few instances where the time traveling bit got slightly confusing to the end - for instance, when he and his father go back to when he was a little kid. He's not supposed to know about time travel until he is 21, as he isn't able to do it until he turns 21. So how does his father explain why he's taking him into a dark closet to take him back to the future.

","The best thing about time is the story written by Richard Curtis , how he's gracefully put story into film and create one of best romantic ,drama, no doubt film is based on sci-fi idea of a person going back in time and undo the changes or try to make things right , but when you watch you're never thought of any sci-fi move or a time machine , the script is crafted and scene natural and pleasurable to watch it's fun to watch the leading pair in the film Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams play her character nicely ,especially Domhnall who play the role of Tim and learnt from her father that how to going back in time and used it wisely to make a girlfriend , save her sister from her past mistakes . Richard Curtis prove that he's a terrific storyteller and director ,I love the editing of film it's just match exactly the rhythm of script , the best scene of mine is were he done sex with her girlfriend Mary and every time he's just go back in time and try to improve her sex timing with her . Every one in the film played her part very well like Tim's father Bill Nighy , and Tim's sister Lydia Wilson , and in last word if you like to go in our past time then go once for about time ."
"athena24","8","0","0","10 May 2014"," Essentially Good.
","About Time is a really good movie, that manages to deliver a message and touch feelings. Someone noted here that this is the reason we go to see movies, and taking About Time as a whole, I totally agree. I was moved, and this feeling is still with me as I write. And I know I'll watch it again.<br/><br/>Now for the technical side. About Time is a light comic drama with a good heart. From the very start one can see the good production values. Very good narrative, performances and cinematography. However, it also introduces some awkwardness, primarily due to the awkward, off bit characters, including Tim. In fact most of the male characters through the movie are such, and this is a bit of a down side. <br/><br/>At start it reminds very much of Groundhog Day. But somewhere along the way it takes its own direction and Groundhog Day is forgotten. It is not always engaging, but for its' above 2 hours length, it has a very good pace, narrative and performances and never boring. For its last part, it starts to be engaging and very moving.<br/><br/>About Time has some drawbacks. First are the already mentioned, off bit characters. I think they were made such to add a comic side, but it mostly felt a bit out of place. However, this wasn't too severe (not in terms of screen time nor in its intensity). The second was some of the occurrences Tim decided to change. He seemed to be quite smart, so understanding the major risks and outcomes of changing the past shouldn't be too hard. Instead, he makes a mistake of changing events too far in time, more than once, which makes him a bit less likable.<br/><br/>However, nothing is flawless. And like a person, this movie has its own drawbacks. And while they're visible, they are outweighed by far by its benefits. About Time succeeds in getting the best emotions from ourselves. Making us think of how we can improve our lives, being us, but looking at things from a slightly different point of view. And just for this, I would recommend it as a must watch."
"eyeintrees","5","2","5","24 March 2018"," Like watching paint dry... over and over and over again
","Boring to a fault. Great IMDB ratings led me to believe this may have been a great premise used well, however, right from the first massive plot defect where the lead male could simply have returned in time to get the girl's phone number again, and yet did not and the plot got terribly stupid and cliché, the entire thing began falling like a badly stacked deck of cards, relying on cliché after cliché and the MOST unremarkable dull lives with something poorly mimicking wit, to attempt to keep it all afloat. 
Not to mention that after the wedding, when all the guests get soaked to the skin, we see them apparently minutes later in the reception, perfectly dry. Silly, silly movie trying to have depth and to shove the same lines of 'live life to the fullest' at us under the premise of actually being a story about living.
Stunning scenery, very good actors, the whole thing looked wonderful and could have lasted 30 minutes and actually been interesting. I was so bored and horrified that people may actually live these kind of hum drum predictable existences. A safe, dull, pretence."
"strassenflirt","6","2","5","27 June 2015"," How did he undo what he changed and other flaws
","I like movies about time travel, but this is full of flaws (more than others). <br/><br/>First, how did he know that he can take other persons with him? Did I miss something? And when he took his sister to ""her"" past and she changed it, they jumped back/forward into the present and both new immediately what changed. His wife asked him what happened in the past but how could she as the old time line does not exist anymore and in the new time line he had no need to travel back. <br/><br/>Then when he realized that his daughter turned into a boy, how did he undo what had changed? The new time line was already in place, so would he take his now happy sister to the past again? And as she knows the old and the new time line she would act the same way as in the first time travel. Or did he return on his own? Then he would have met himself. Or did the travel back replace him with his other self and he strangely - in the eyes of his sister - changes his mind and just says nothing? <br/><br/>As another writer mentioned, if he always comes out in his cupboard what happens with him in that past? Does he just disappear? And what would happen if that cupboard didn't exist in that past?<br/><br/>When he visits his father in the past in his living room, why did his father know that he time traveled? Didn't he ever meet his father in that time line the ""normal"" way?<br/><br/>When he visits his father for the last time we can hear his father and him(?!) play table tennis as he just exits the cupboard and then the camera jumps to both playing. So he existed twice for some seconds?<br/><br/>In this scene his father acts as if he would never see his son again. But that is not true, because Tim in that time line lives his normal life. Does his dad ever tell him that he will visit him in the future? Obviously not, because otherwise Tim would know that he visits his father before he does it.<br/><br/>That is the big problem of (impossible) time travel. You change the memories of yourself when you tell someone in the past about you and he tells it to your other self. So you must have that information BEFORE you even change the past. The same thing as killing your grand pa. <br/><br/>The film ""Back to the future"" handled this paradox in a more elegant way as the people really existed more than once in that time lines and so they could change their own behavior."
"T_Side","6","2","5","31 May 2015"," I felt manipulated...
","This isn't the first occasion I've seen About Time, indeed I caught it back at the cinema and was won over by it, its sweet charm and English whimsy.<br/><br/>But this time... I don't know, came away feeling like I'd been manipulated emotionally by it. I was ready to be enchanted all over again by a feel good movie, but instead I found myself not liking the main character, Tim, very much at all, compensating for his life mistakes by erasing them and having another go. No one gets this. We all mess up from time to time, and it's the learning from those moments that defines us. But not Tim. He just gets to do it all over again, right this time, or perhaps not as his wooing of Rachel McAdam's character came across as more than a little creepy. I get that we're supposed to think it's okay, essentially innocent, his quoting back lines to her about Kate Moss in an attempt to worm his way into her affections. Oh look, it's that nice, slightly awkward yet wholesome English lad; isn't that lovely? Well no, not really, and I found myself remembering Elijah Wood using bits of Kate Winslet's stolen memories in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as a less honourable attempt at courtship (which, appropriately, she sees right through). <br/><br/>If you don't buy into all that, which I didn't on this occasion, then the rest comes crashing down. The supporting characters are nearly all so one-dimensional that you can sum them up in a single word - sister Kit Kat (scatty), Rory (embarrassing), Harry (rude), etc. Again, nobody in reality is like this, but that level of complexity doesn't fit in with the film so the characters are defined by their single-word stereotypes. <br/><br/>I still have feeling for it, though, entirely because of the Bill Nighy character, Tim's dad. As with the rest of About Time, father's aren't as perfect as he is (I know; I am one), but the sweet natured relationship between Tim and his dad (he's even credited on the cast list as 'Dad') just about saves it. Still a pleasant surprise to have this element in the film, and it gets to me every time."
"padmapriyatnl","6","2","5","9 November 2014"," A wasted potential
","The movie had a lot of potential possibilities except they just used it to give a message 'Live every day giving your best by enjoying it' which is of course good but they did not need a sci-fi setting and waste that. The start is promising as we see Tim has a gift to go back in time and change it. Tim uses it to his advantage so he goes on to impress a girl by getting to know her first time and acting as per her likes next time. He uses this in every scenario to impress her. In first part we get to see how once Tim travels to same time and goes to another place, his earlier actions go on missing erasing that time line. This point was reiterated throughout showing how Tim could never change some things. However we never get to see this point into a big drama point. Tim sees his father dying and he still travels back to meet him which he can never do once his child is born. The moment that he has to let go of his father's memory which he revisits was poignant and handled well. However at the end the movie feels incomplete as if a half baked cake with a promising setting but a gone opportunity."

","Review: This is quite a heart warming story about a teenager who has the ability to travel back in time. As the main character is able to correct his mistakes in life, he manages to find the lady of his life but he is a able to correct every problem in his life. Personally, I think that they could have picked a better leading character because I was unable to relate to the one that the director had chosen. Apart from that, is great writing and there is enough material to keep the storyline interesting. In some ways, it seemed more like a chick flick even though the main character was a boy. Anyway, it's worth a watch but don't expect anything different from Richard Curtis.<br/><br/>Round-Up: I'm really becoming a Bill Nighy fan because of his way of acting and the way that he can make any situation funny. Tom Hallander was quite funny and Rachel McAdams was a great choice for her role. She seems to add a sweetness to all of the roles which out shone the leading character who did have much screen charisma, but I think that was a deliberate choice by the director. Anyway, it's true family fun but it's not a classic like Love Actually or Notting Hill.<br/><br/>Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $86million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there time travel movie about a teenager trying to correct his mistakes throughout his life. 6/10"
"peterp-450-298716","9","2","5","5 January 2014"," About time i watch it again ...
","Maybe it's because I'm getting older and more mature. Or is it simply because it's a perfect movie ? I put all my money on the second guess because in the end I found it an amazing and captivating romantic comedy . Normally I hate movies containing the combination of romance and humor. Usually the humor is of a questionable level and it threatens to become a corny tearjerker with a predictable happy ending where everyone is happily married. Actually all of that is in this movie , but not on a grotesquely sentimental level as in other chick flicks . Like someone said on IMDb "" A chick flick for men"" .<br/><br/>Occasionally, I have to listen to my wife and select a movie which will lead to a cozy movie night she can enjoy. Instead of watching again at some nerve wrecking, bloody and violent SF or thriller. With much reluctance I try to look for that kind of movie. The thing that convinced me to choose for ""About time"" was the SF label it got . Ultimately, the SF part is essential for the whole story, but it is not the crucial element which leaves a lingering impression. It's just a great movie where you get sucked in from the beginning and you feel like you're in the center of the story. Tim has a gift that all men possess in his family . He can go back in time . Not to change (kill Hitler/shag Helen of Troy ) world history .Only situations occurring in his personal life he can change. He wants to use that gift to find the love of his life.<br/><br/>It has immensely funny situations and humorous conversations . I laughed at this film more than any would-be comedy that I have seen in recent months. Those funny situations that happen are so recognizable and pure. Nothing forced, no complicated puns or fetched trivialities . The conversation in the dark restaurant run by blind people . Who came up with that? Their first night and the way Tim returns again and again in time . The frustrations Tim shows while helping Mary to choose an evening dress. I understood him perfectly.Meeting Mary's parents . The one-liners that passed from time to time.The awkward friends like Jay and Rory . Uncle D who was moving in a certain way , but at the same time hilarious. Every time my wife and I laughed about it. <br/><br/>It's enormously romantic. God yes, you get that in a romantic comedy . But it's that romance that also occurs infinite times in real life and not the romance you read in cheap pulp magazines. Sometimes it was brought subtle. Tim could easily use his gift to have a hot night with Charlotte .Finally he says no to that thought and runs back to Mary to ask her to marry him. A symbolic way to show that Mary is his true love . The scene with the live band was also hilarious. <br/><br/>The film also has its emotional moments . These are the moments where the sticker "" Beware of irritating objects in the eye"" applies to. The relationship with his father gets gradually warmer and caring. The concerns about his sister Kit Kat . The death of his father and the special way he definitively says goodbye. Serene, catchy and stunning. The casting is perfect. <br/><br/>Each character feels like a real individual and fits into the complete picture . Both physically and mentally. Tim is a daydreaming , sometimes awkward but sensitive guy . Domhnall Gleeson delivers a magnificent performance . I didn't recognize him as Bill Weasley of the Potter series , and even as Clan Techie from Dredd . Rachel McAdams who plays Mary is a natural beauty and a charm throughout the film . Bill Nighy puts a rock-solid portrait of the father who struggles with his feelings towards his son. Lindsey Duncan has no big part in this movie, but each time she comes into the picture she has the look of a caring mother. Honestly , there wasn't a single character that I found weak. Finally the soundtrack is also worth a mention . Songs of The Cure , Amy Winehouse , Nick Cave and Ben Folds were a splendid contribution to the overall mood. I've always liked movies. <br/><br/>I watch movies because I want a relaxing moment , a moment to laugh or bite my nails cause of the tension, or nearly get a heart attack from scaring , or sympathize with certain events and sometimes cry a little bit about it . Those are the reasons to watch a movie. And that I found in this movie . My advice is to just give this one a chance and let yourself be carried away on a sentimental and funny roller-coaster ride of emotions.<br/><br/>More reviews at meningvanfilmfreak.blogspot.be"
"PassPopcorn","7","2","5","9 December 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","Richard Curtis, the director and writer of About Time, is a well-known screenwriter, whose most famous scripts include those for the Bridget Jones movies, for Love Actually and for Notting Hill – so you kind of know what to expect from him already: a cute and funny romantic comedy, but no Oscar bait. About Time, I think, tries to be something more than a romantic comedy, and in a way it manages to do so: it's not only about a relationship between a man and a woman, there is also the love for family members. Unfortunately, this movie fails in creating any drama – it's more like watching a compilation of images from someone's life – and in this aspect it should have just sticked to the romantic comedy genre.<br/><br/>Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) lives an almost ideal life with his almost perfect family: the only thing he's missing is a girlfriend. But when his father (Bill Nighy), on Tim's 21st birthday, reveals to him that all male members of their family can travel back in time, he decides to use this ability to find a girlfriend. He moves to London, gets a job and meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), with whom he falls in love, one evening in a café. He discovers that changing the course of events by going back in time has major consequences, not all of which are pleasant. Therefore, he must decide what is more important, and realise that the ability to travel back in time perhaps isn't that much of an advantage.<br/><br/>It's impossible not to notice similarities with other movies, especially with the anime The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, but that's a good thing. The main problem with this movie, like I already said, is the fact that there is no real story, no drama, no problems that last till the end of the movie and our heroes have to resolve. For example, after he finds Mary and gets her number, he has to go back in time to help a friend – and ends up never meeting her. This story, his searching for the girl of his dreams, could have been stretched out to last an hour and a half, but instead the issue is resolved in ten minutes, and the movie goes on for more than an hour. The main character's sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) is the only one who has constant issues she needs to resolve, but her role is too marginal to be really relevant.<br/><br/>The main problem I just explained might as well be the movie's best quality. It is just a collection of segments from someone's life, and almost every segment is positive, which makes it more a therapy than a movie. Most of the time, while watching About Time, you'll find yourself laughing and feeling happy, and once you exit the theater, you'll probably feel satisfied with the life you're leading – which is the message of the movie. The actors, the cinematography and the music help with that: the cast is talented, the scenery beautiful (and mostly shows sunny days or calm nights). One may argue that the movie is too idealistic, that nobody leads such an awesome life in reality. My opinion is that it's not about what happens to you, it's about how you handle it, and the characters in About Time handle it very well.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"

","For me, there is no getting around the fact that it just feels wrong for Rachel McAdams to be in a film so undeniably similar to her previous film The Time Traveler's Wife. That just is what it is.<br/><br/>However, even though it feels a bit derivative in plot and pushes the bounds of even time-travel logic here and there, this film gets at least a 7.5-8.0 rating from me on the strength of the story that is being told, and what a purely beautiful takeaway it gives.<br/><br/>It is not really about time travel. It is about relationships, but not in a saccharine, run-of-the-mill way. McAdams is unbelievably cute of course, but Domhnall Gleeson is absolutely brilliant as the lead character and the entire cast is superb.<br/><br/>I wont' drone on...About Time is one of the sweetest, mostly beautiful, most inspiring films that I have seen in a long time. It does not take its high-concept premise too seriously (which is a good thing) but it takes the characters and their humanity and their connections to each other very seriously ( which is to say that it has real emotional weight - also a very good thing). Better than it looks like it will be from a distance, just tearfully gorgeous up close, and thus it gets my recommendation."

Some of the best scenes occur before McAdams, as American import Mary, enters the picture Tim tries to politely bed-down his sister's gorgeous best friend, and after learning a thing or two about fate and getting lucky (and how the two don't always mix), the primary romance begins...<br/><br/>Tim meets Mary during a match-up date and... without giving too many clever twists away, things don't always go as planned He uses time travel (no machine needed, you just stand inside an enclosed room, clench your fists and close your eyes tight) to alter sporadic events, ranging from his new relationship to helping a friend's stage play to choosing the right best man...<br/><br/>The down-points are that the characters, including Tim and his artistic family, are a tad over-contented and unrealistically cozy Sometimes writer/director Richard Curtis tugs too tightly on the heartstrings And eventually, by the somewhat overlong conclusion, there's a feeling the time travel aspect was a mere plot device to serve up a clichéd existential theme...<br/><br/>But for a worthy alternative to big budget comic book movies and any sort of mainstream Hollywood romance, this is a ""date flick"" that should benefit either party"

","""About Time"" is one film that when you watch you see it as a sci-fi type fairy tale with themes of love and living happily ever after, yet underneath it all the picture has much more. Though it may be a little short on reality with the theme of traveling back in time still enough love, life and passion with chance and circumstance is present to make the film a real winner. And it's spice and sugar is just nice with some sexy scenes of Rachel McAdams wearing very sexy multi colored bras! Set in England Tim(Domhnall Gleeson)21 a young man who struggles with finding love finds out one day after a New Year's party from his father(Bill Nighy)that all of the men in his family have the gift of traveling back in time! And this special power can be reached by simply going away in a little room and closing both fist tight and wishing and picturing to go back in time! The direction from Richard Curtis is so brilliant the way he mixes it up with finding love and he proves that life is about chance and circumstance, it's so good that Tim can go back in time to change the bad things and make them all good! And thru this time travel Tim is able to change his biggest shortfall and that's finding love. Going back in time to the night of the party he takes it back to meet a young sweet but insecure cute lady an American named Mary(the sexy Rachel McAdams). Now that life chance and circumstance has been corrected the two fall in love with hot passion and sex. The best scenes are Tim going back in time over and over so he can continue to make love better each time with Mary until he's just so tired he can't anymore! Plus it was nice seeing McAdams sport that sexy black multi colored bra as each film that Rachel is in she shows more and more of herself in sexy colored bras! Thru it all life, love, and family and happiness occurs with time travel back to the past correcting the bad. Hard to believe it all still ""About Time"" is a touching film that shows every minute of life, love, time, and family is to be enjoyed because time is short always make the most of it. This is one film to make the time to see."

","I knew I needed to see this movie because I freaking cried at the trailer. The trailer! How embarrassing. Gone are the days when I can make it through a movie (OR A TRAILER) with dry eyes. At what age does that change? Have I turned into a complete hopeless romantic? Tim and his father, the sensational Bill Nighy, go into any dark place, clench their fists (oddly enough in Power Rangers fashion) and choose the place they wish to travel to. While Tim can't necessarily change his history, he can certainly fix the bad decisions he has made along the way. Just by the concept alone, I was already hooked. Who wouldn't want to have opportunities for a redo? Or many, for that matter? Check out why we would see this movie again and again: http://bit.ly/1gyrK9J"

","Tim, has found out the secrets at the age of 21. Tim and his first decision to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend and the processes which he chose to take and how his friends and family were affected in his choices. The story line has a few great twists and wake up calls for the audiences. There are slight reminders to the people of how we live. The experience which Tim takes and the awareness which is shown on screen has thoughts which many think but hardly express. I found this movie funny, moving and leaves you with great thoughts on you own life and how you live it. I recommend this movie for many to watch more than once. To see the little life meanings which are there right on screen, for the audiences notes for their own lives and ways of living."
"ugurkalafat","10","2","5","6 October 2013"," Not a stereotypical one!
","Well, I am actually against those movies which are completely based on emotional abuse as if they are telling the story of true love. However, this one is really different. Simplicity and naturalness in this movie are making pure love and ideal family relations much more attractive despite the fact that these are the issues that have been handled in a very stereotypical and boring manner in other films so far.<br/><br/>I gotta admit that I went to cinema with low expectations, but this film not just surprised me, but it has also broke down my prejudices about ""those"" films. I must add that, it is a touching film in a sense that love is not just the thing that happens between a couple, but it is also the thing that any person may feel towards someone in his/her family. The scenes of table tennis matches or skimming stones with father were actually emphasizes how important little memories are, and how it makes us feel loving towards a special person. It was so striking."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","4","14","19 October 2013"," The film's lasting impression is one of a good idea that just needed longer development
","The writer-director of About Time Richard Curtis was born in New Zealand to Australian parents. As a boy he moved all around the world but is now firmly established in England. He has worked predominantly as a screenwriter on some of the most successful British romantic comedies ever made, including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's Diary. His transnational upbringing could be an influence on why these films sometimes have Americans cast in the lead roles. Having an international star also offers a bigger box-office ticket in the US market. With Julia Roberts, Notting Hill became a financial milestone in British cinema. Speculation has mounted this could also be Curtis' last film as director, which would account for the film's ruminations on life fulfilment.<br/><br/>About Time uses a similar casting formula, with Canadian Rachel McAdams in a lead role, but in spite of some big laughs the film is letdown by a middling, underdeveloped script. Perhaps if someone else had helmed the film Richard Curtis could have refined some of the rough edges of the screenplay, particularly its boggy second half and the rather ambitious time travel aspects. This is disappointing because up till then the film is engaging and funny, partly due to the likable casting of Domhnall Gleeson (the son of Irish actor Brendan Gleeson). He plays Tim, a young man told by his father (Bill Nighy) that all the men in his family can time travel. He can only return to things that have already happened though, leading to some funny encounters involving a New Years Eve party and a summer spent at home with his sister and her friend Charlotte (Australian Margot Robbie), who he tries to court. There's no reasoning as to why the men can time travel but the device is used comically. Returning to the same scene upholds and repeats the gag, making it funnier and sometimes with surprising results too. <br/><br/>Some of the cracks in the screenplay coincide with the arrival of Mary (McAdams). Tim first meets her on a blind date but after he travels back in time to repair something he loses her number. This means that he must introduce himself to her again at an art gallery but as a stranger. When he starts telling her things that he couldn't possibly know, he's been to the future, the comedy verges ever slightly towards the creepy side. Rachel McAdams has a glowing presence on screen and shares easy, relaxed chemistry with Gleeson. One of the faults in the script though is that no matter how likable her company, Mary lacks dimensions and a complete inner life outside of Tim. She is a reader for a publishing company but we little of her work life for example. Her parents are uptight American conservatives but only feature for a single gag scene. Comparatively, Tim has multiple friends, a housemate, a progressive job as a lawyer, a troubled sister and genuine concern for his dad. <br/><br/>Once the central relationship blossoms early around the halfway mark the narrative is left with very little dramatic thrust. There is a turning point when Tim is reintroduced to Charlotte but the film opts to completely sidestep a potentially devastating source of conflict. Gaps in the logic of the time travel are never resolved either. Tim never has the problem of meeting himself when reliving moments and the rules about what can be altered and what can't are changed to suit the script. Pap messages about taking life one day at a time make up the final quarter of a film that is unjustifiably two hours long. Although it's rarely short of being breezy and sometimes very funny, the film's lasting impression is one of a good idea that just needed longer development or a more objective view of the project."

","I have nothing more to say about this terrible film beyond the title of my review."
"Avid_Movie_Viewer","3","3","11","30 January 2014"," The Trailer was better than the Movie ..
","I had expectations from the trailer that this would be a tale of a protagonist that had some social shortcomings and how time travel would help him overcome them to fall in love.<br/><br/>Instead the movie appeared to be a quest by our protagonist to appear smooth and suave with women in manufactured relationship. Our protagonist Tim pursues two young women\girls in the film. One was puppy love that never comes to fruition and the other was completely manufactured by the time travel. I never saw a connection between Tim and Mary. We're supposed to believe that they fall in love with each other the very first day they meet. That was a bit much to believe. Worse is that he uses the time travel to manufacture the relationship. That's not love it's a guy manipulating someone.<br/><br/>Tim appeared like a needy guy who didn't want to do anything to screw up and end a relationship. He did screw up and end the relationships on multiple occasions but with the time travel he went back and fixed it. Funny but the relationship came off as not genuine.<br/><br/>The relationship between Tim and his dad appeared very genuine from beginning to end. That was the strength of this movie.<br/><br/>I actually thought our hero Tim would be forced to sacrifice his manufactured relationship with Mary with something important that would require him to time travel back before meeting Mary or having his children. There was a chance for this with his sister's accident or his father's death but Tim chooses to help himself instead which left me disappointed that everything was so easy. <br/><br/>This movie had potential but it took the road most traveled."
"Viation","1","2","6","7 September 2019"," The absolute worst.
","As a man in my early twenties, RomComs are my guilty pleasure. I like them, I really do. And I've watched really bad ones and still liked them. Whether it was for their relatable characters or their main cast, there's almost always something positive I can ""cling"" to, even in the bad RomComs. But this one was too much. While the gist of the story would theoretically make for a good movie, gigantic plot holes, illogical use of the main character's time traveling ability and the incredibly dumb (that painfully, cringe inducing kinda dumb, not the cute kinda dumb) behavior of the main character make this unwatchable for me.
I realize I'm not necessarily the target audience but I would recommend staying away from this even if you are."
"ajrg-17-381639","5","2","6","24 September 2018"," Good movie but too saccharine
","There are many good lines in here. The main character instead of delivering them in his own way does an imitation of Hugh Grant, but sad to say lacks something. They are good just not as interesting. And why not - this script was written by the same person who wrote Notting Hill, Richard Curtis. The acting is good. The script should have been rewritten a few more times. He wanted us to learn about life, to live everyday carefree, and instead it becomes somewhat pointless and at the end instead of crying I wanted it to end. On the other hand it is not upsetting, has good scenes and is a good movie to put on before you go to sleep."
"masandaglinus123","5","2","6","1 April 2015"," A ridiculous use of the time travel
","Richard Curtis once again made another film about romance and this time it's got a twist, TIME TRAVEL. Sure, critics and moviegoers find this sweet and sentimental and one of Curtis' best flick, but don't they get tired of all the Hollywood time travel wannabees and trying to make time travel a much more easy subject? Now, time travel films are now scattered around the globe and it's irritating. In this film, it's about a man who learns that all men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. To use this, they would go inside a closet and close their eyes while clenching their fist and then voila, they can now travel in time. What the fu**?! Is that it? It's not enough science and it's too brainless. Do they think time travel would be that easy? I just hate it.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to agree on some people who thought that this film captures the best of romance. It has its sweet and funny moments, valuable lessons about love and great music too. Rachel McAdams is charming as always. Did you know that this is her third film about time travel romance? She first appeared in Robert Schwentke's The Time Traveler's Wife and then Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. And now, in here. Didn't she get tired already? But of course, one thing I liked about this movie that it's beautifully filmed from start to finish. What more can I say?<br/><br/>Overall, About Time is sweet, funny and sentimental but as I said, the ridiculous use of the time travel makes this film a huge disappointment. I think it's about time to stop this ridiculous subject unless if they really know the subject very well and had enough brains. I think I will give this film a score of 5. Oh and by the way, there was no chemistry between Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams."

","We loved this movie, and definitely see it as PG-13! The ""R"" rating is wrong, and I would encourage any family with teens to see it. It is beautifully scripted with excellent acting by the entire cast. The dialogue is heartfelt and original, especially between father and son, Bill Nighy and Domnhall Gleeson, who are superb portraying the humor and unabashed love that can exist in a family when there is a core of acceptance and support for each other. The time travel device , or ""do-overs"" is cleverly used to show how self-confidence and doing the right thing create desired outcomes. As the story evolves, the father/son time travelers discover that do-overs aren't always possible, and ultimately learn to fully engage in enjoying life as it comes, rather than reserving their feelings for another day."
"Dan_L","9","2","6","24 October 2013"," Just a Sheer Delight
","My wife and I saw ""About Time"" at a special preview at our local theater, knowing almost nothing about the film. Maybe that's one of the reasons it was so immensely enjoyable. The film is not predictable -- you never really know where it's going. There was something incredibly natural about the film. The acting, directing, writing -- they all felt natural, missing the usual phony contrivances so typical of Hollywood. This may have been Rachel McAdams' finest performance yet -- it didn't feel like she was acting and she certainly wasn't anything remotely like her role in ""Midnight in Paris."" The central family was relatively normal (pun intended) and not dysfunctional. The father and mother were real treats. The considerable humor was so, natural -- not forced, guttural, or contrived. And the occasional tears of sadness and joy that flowed in the viewers' eyes were natural as well -- not forced, not manipulated. I deliberately didn't want to give away anything about the plot and where the film goes, for the fresh path it takes is part of the joy of viewing this refreshing and very entertaining film."

","Went to a sneak preview of this on a whim, knowing literally nothing about the film other than the title. Initially was surprised to find it was English even. The theater was full, and about 90% women. It turned out to be on of the more enjoyable movies I've seen in ages-- characters you could care about, plenty of light laughs, and enough tension to keep it interesting. We found ourselves expecting some plot points that didn't occur, and the ones that did instead were well done. Some tears were shed, and not necessarily at the moments that were clearly intended to draw that sort of emotional response.<br/><br/>Really, one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. Good writing, enjoyable dialog, solid acting from the leads on down, and while the running time hits two hours you'd hardly notice as the pacing is light and always keeps you engaged, wondering what will happen next."

It was very odd.<br/><br/>The father/son relationship was very sweet.

"truemythmedia","7","1","2","8 August 2019"," A Delightful but Flawed Romantic Comedy
","I've often talked about how when you have a film that falls on the border of decent and good, it really is up to the viewer personal preferences to decide how they feel about that film. I've given ""About Time"" 3.5 Stars. There are some great scenes that I think could've boosted this movie to a 4 Star rating, while there are other scenes that could've dropped it down to a 3 star. It is not, as I have already mentioned, as good as I remember it to be (how many films really are ageless?), but I do think it's still worth a watch. This was my fourth time watching this film, and I can honestly say I probably will watch it again a few years down the road. I think the fact that I spent more time pontificating on the pros and cons of this film than I usually do should be enough to indicate that I feel something special for this film, that it does mean something to me even though it does have plenty of flaws.<br/><br/>I find the sweetness and kindness instilled in some of the scenes in this movie displays a kind of tenderness that I rarely see in modern film. I still get a few chuckles from some of the side characters (particularly Tom Hollander (""A Private War"")), and I still love the father son relationship between Tim and his Dad. No, this isn't a perfect film, but few films are. My personal preferences and my own experiences with this film will lead me to like it more than some people, but I think many people will still find this to be an overall enjoyable experience."

I like how it wasn't mainly focussed on the love story but also on more serious topics: loss, grieving, substance abuse.

","This is not a movie you'd expect to have a life-changing impacts (though you may have), nor one that makes your jaw drop.<br/><br/>This is a movie that entertains and helps you insert a little bit more of positivity in your life. So don't expect extreme conflict points or the presentation of harsh reality of life.<br/><br/>The main motivation of the protagonist was romance. This and the fact that Tim and Mary's relationship takes most part of the movie belittle the important key element of the relationship between Tim and his Dad. The movie feels like it tries to emphasize the relationship between Tim and Mary, even though this is only a portion of it all. Their relationship could be better too. They are both interesting but the lax chemistry between the two also presents.<br/><br/>The time travel element is where I like the most. Most movies would present actions and major events in the world, but in About Time the time travel is simple and it is far from the tiring idea of butterfly effect.<br/><br/>I understand though that Richard Curtis wanted to include all kinds of relationships that Tim has, and show a little appreciation of time for everyone.

The charaters are carefully designed and they express themselves in a sensible non-effusive way. The tongue in cheek humor adds additional flavor.

","My son came to visit and asked me if I'd ever seen ""About Time"". ""Is that the one with Justin Timberlake?"" I said. 
The next thing I know he was streaming it and the moment I saw it was a British film I was like ""Ugh"".
After a few minutes I was hooked and slowly won over by the dry humor of Bill Nighy and the sweet vulnerability of the Irish actor (whose name escapes me at the moment) playing Tim. The premise of the movie was two-fold; a coming of age romance for Tim and simultaneously a story of love between father and son.
Without revealing any spoilers I will say that the ending had both me and my son in tears. 
We started talking about times with my son's grandparents and what experiences he wished could be replayed with more focus so they (the grandparents) would have felt the love my son had for both of them. I told him they knew that without it being said. Then I shared some of my memories of my parents and younger brother who died when my son was two years old.

Yes as any time traveling movie it does but there are so much more good things in this movie you won't question it. It's casting is 0erfect Tim,the father, sister, uncle, mary everyone did their job perfectly the story is somewhat slow paced and that gives the movie the meaning. Even if it's fantasy it really depicts how you cope with life and everything that comes with it. The soundtracks were perfect. not one but all of them. Domnhall did a great job portraying Tim and a nod to Rachel too for what she'd done. It's not always that you come across a movie that hits you right in the feels. It has got drama, comedy, tragedy and I think that's what makes it appetizing. I haven't been more impressed by a movie like this in my entire life and I don't think I'll ever be again. This is one of those movies that are so good you don't even want to go back to reality. I guess that's why they call them fantasy huh?"

","About Time is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a very sweet and heartwarming film as we follow a young man who learns he has the power to time travel and uses it to win a girl over. However, as the film continues, he uses his power less and less, as he begins to savor the moments and not trying to reverse them. It easily could have been a typical love story, but it has plenty of elements that make it stand out. <br/><br/>The only real issue I had was Bill Nighy, I thought he was fantastic as the father and found him to be very underused. His character is underdeveloped, we learn very little about him, I would love to have gained more insight on him, as I thought the scenes between him and Gleeson's character are the film's highlights. <br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is stellar in this movie, believable and likable all the way through, as well as a character that I feel anyone can relate to. His chemistry with Rachel McAdams is phenomenal, it is a privilege to watch them on screen together, delivering pure, honest emotion. <br/><br/>The film leaves you feeling happy for the life you have lived and excited for what awaits, as we must make the best of the time we have. Sweet and well acted, I would recommend About Time to anyone looking for a good drama or romantic film. <br/><br/>A man's life gets complicated when he uses his ability to time travel to seek romantic bliss. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Domhnall Gleeson"
"scott-859-748921","10","1","2","23 January 2017"," Beautiful, Poignant, and Funny, with a Timeless message about Love, Family, and Time
","This is an incredible movie for I believe it's a romantic comedy with a deep, poignant message that is purposely intended primarily for men. I've watched this movie two times now and both times it has made me cry. Both times it's made me focus on what's most valuable in life.<br/><br/>The point I feel the writer and director wanted to make here is about our precious relationships, particularly between father and son, and the importance and temporal nature of time. Time, like our lives, is a vapor that will quickly disappear. Enjoy each day like it's our last. Make life enjoyable for others in your life. Great humor. Sublime, subtle acting, particularly from Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson (carefully watch the subtle nuances in their faces throughout every scene). Richard Curtis is one of the finest British writers and directors of the modern era, always managing to capture and fuse love, emotion, and humor. <br/><br/>I am super critical of movies and I'm very hard to please where films are concerned, but this movie is one of the best I have ever seen and moved me in a way I have never been moved before with a movie. Great acting, extremely well written, funny, poignant, and an excellent cast. It's extraordinary the way this movie was written to elicit such emotion from the viewer, especially men. Be prepared to change the way you view your relationship with your father, and the precious, transient nature of time."
"sharky_55","8","1","2","17 January 2017"," I'll go out with Matt Damon.
","You're either a fan of Richard Curtis, or you're not. There's not much space in between. Long time admirers have readily come to terms with the fact that his stories will never venture outside that safe, spotless and sanitised version of England, which is often coupled with the aggressively quaint middle class of Hugh Grant. Yet his films are not always as modest as they are on the surface, particularly when they claim to represent the entire country's longing near Christmas time. Now that I think about it, it's often the effortless, windswept debonair of Grant that prevents these films from being too scrutinised. Would we question that chiselled jaw the same way we question the gangly, awkward ginger of Gleeson? Tim finds an early and sweet connection with Mary on a blind (literally) double date at a restaurant, and feels as if he is entitled to that same connection after his time travelling erases it. Perhaps he is, but is it then morally right to pretend to be someone he is not? To act vastly more interested in her interests than he really is, to redo their first time in bed until they are lights out, to mouth off at the potential boyfriend that he beats to the chase (a mean-spirited, out of character comment)? Mary herself doesn't seem to have a lot of say in this relationship, and when he pushes Tim for a third child, it feels less like an actual desire of her character and more the screenplay tapping Tim on the shoulder and telling him that his time is up. In Lindsay Duncan's interrogations, her imperfections are cutesy labels that don't appear anywhere else, while he's erased all of his. It feels dishonest. <br/><br/>In response to these dilemmas Curtis might respond by showing the first example of Tim's experimentation with time travel, a simple and elegant demonstration of the power's limitations after a summer of attempting to woo Charlotte. That reasoning suggests that no matter how many different approaches Tim fashions she is bound to gently reject him, and so vice versa the same must apply to Mary: the initial spark is there, so their romance is merely a matter of time. This notion might have more weight to it if Curtis wasn't playing fast and loose with the logic of his brand of time travel. The power is lightly sprung onto a young Tim from his father with the nonchalance of buying a teenager a new car, and he only pops up periodically to shed new light on rules and regulations. The story is sweeter and more honest when the characters are the ones making the choices themselves; her slipping a little white lie into their conversation and getting him to walk her all the way home, and after the most casually adorable proposal ever, he doesn't rush to the nearest cupboard, but merely shushes the planned band away. Their wedding's weather must be a black omen from the heavens themselves, but she wouldn't even dare consider the idea of a redo. <br/><br/>Curtis' flair behind the camera shines best when he injects splashes of formal elements into the honeymoon period of two young lovers - how Mary first emerges from the restaurant curtains with a little halo over her head, how the camera shakes with giddiness during Tim's walk home, in the way the world seems to come alive at their feet, and in how subway buskers seem to be personally serenading their blossoming romance. When he's not leaning on voice-over the soundtrack does an adequate job, churning whenever Tim's anxiety beckons him to the cupboard, and softly accompanying the pair on piano in the gentler moments. He also utilises the montage to great comedic effect, one prominent example cycling through the various disasters of best man speeches and cutting abruptly to signal Tim's exasperation. <br/><br/>But for all the rain-soaked sentimentality About Time moves towards a rather different end goal than the posters and Curtis' film history might suggest. The awkward Tim has solved the problem of his fanciful love life, but what happens when he tries to wield his powers to save others in his family? Kit Kat, who bounds in and out of scenes like an overexcited puppy, crashes and burns because she does not have the power, or so Tim thinks. Contrivances that force him to let things play out aside, he learns that sometimes fate is better off left alone, and that sometimes you need to let those you love learn their own lessons. Gleeson sells the role we all envision ourselves in by trying desperately to reach out and shield everyone, and in doing so discovering the cursed side of his blessing. It's a long way just to say 'carpe diem', but the message is well intentioned. Near the end there are a series of shots of a sleepy Mary nestling her head back into her pillow, and they are cut in a way that suggests Tim is replaying the day over and over, when in fact it is merely his mind magnifying and basking in the moment. He hasn't lost his power of time travel, but he's gained a new one in the appreciation of mortality and the preciousness of life."

","A movie about time-travel with a slight twist, 'About Time' is a British romantic comedy drama directed by Richard Curtis and starring Domnhall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>Domnhall Gleeson plays the role of a young man(Tim Lake) from a seemingly normal family of his parents, sister and his absent-minded uncle that is until his father tells him about the unique ability the men in his family have. Tim has the ability to go to any moment in his life which he has lived by thinking a little hard about it. While his father has used his time-travelling ability to read books, he advises Tim to use this ability to improve his life. But there was only one thing which Tim would use the ability for, to get himself a girlfriend.<br/><br/>Behind the amusing story of Tim trying to find love in his life, lie some really great messages on how to make the most of your life. Richard Curtis has beautifully and subtly portrayed them. Tim has the ultimate gift which almost everyone wishes to have, to be able change past mistakes, to be able to do things which we missed out or held ourselves from. Tim can live any past day again for the umpteenth time. But his journey through the film teaches him to live everyday just once but as if it is the second time and appreciate the small but important things in life. At one point in the film, he tries to better his sister's life by changing her past decisions but when he realizes the repercussions of this method, he has to undo the changes and finally helps his sister clean up her act in the present. His journey also teaches him to let go of things, in this case his father, and accept life as it comes.<br/><br/>The only problem with the movie which I found was a small issue with his powers. Tim discovers that if he jumps to time before his children are born, he might lose them or get other ones due to various factors. But this was essential to actually impart the messages which underlie the film.<br/><br/>The performances by Domnhall Gleeson and Bill Nighy(Tim's father) are spectacular and invoke a feeling of deep connection with the character. Rachel McAdams plays the role of Tim's unknowing wife portraying a strong character who supports the unsure Tim in his problems with life.<br/><br/>The movie touches upon some sensitive issues like the lack of time we face and how we miss out on the small but important things in life and gives an important less i.e. to appreciate the life which you have and to live it with no regrets."

But the main theme is love. The love is not only a pair of lovers, but also family. When we were children, we knew only love of family. But we know a many kinds of love in proportion as we grow up. Especially it is love of a boyfriend or girlfriend. In addition we know we love someone. And own family was the most important when we were children, but it is changed. A lovable person, a boyfriend or girlfriend, is the most important. If we have baby, maybe it becomes the most important. This movie describes these things wonderfully.

","After another disappointing New Year's party, a young man learns to travel time from his father. Thus the most important plot device of the movie is introduced.<br/><br/>Every scene is outstanding, well acted and put together, can't say a bad word about it! In fact whole movie is excels in that department. <br/><br/>Unfortunately storyline is not as good as acting and directing. Sloppy time travel rules lead to countless plot holes and overuse of the power. It simply becomes ultimate answer for every problem of the life. I wonder if he travels time whenever he overcooks food or stains a toilet seat. I really waited for the second act, I wanted to see main character facing real problem and grow as a person. But I was disappointed, every problem and conflict can be easily resolved and character development is mostly observed through narration.<br/><br/>But the most annoying part of the movie are forced morals. Lesson of the movie is to live every day as it was final, make a decision and live with it. It sounds extremely ironic, coming from a time traveler, who cheated most of his adulthood problems and decisions.<br/><br/>For me movie was quite conflicting, but over all impression is good. I like father-son relationship, I laughed at awkward moments and I loved some of romantic moments. It's a good movie and worth watching, but definitely not a 10/10. <br/><br/>My vote is 7.5, rounded to 7 just to compensate for 10/10 reviews. <br/><br/>If you think this is the best romantic movie with fantasy/Sci-Fi elements watch Grounhog Day or Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"
"kosmasp","7","1","2","2 June 2014"," Simple yet effective
","One thing you have to do, if you decide watching this: Do not care about inconsistencies. Or trying to make sense of it. There is more wrong with the internal logic that you will be able to stomach (if you go down that road). Of course the actors are able to distract you most of the time (really nice work done there), but there will be times where you're just going to go: Really? <br/><br/>Again, try to suppress that urge and dive into the sweetness of this movie. And the fun you can have with it too. It's a romantic comedy with a ""twist"" (if you want to call it that). But time travel issues have brought down other movies too. It never can be completely on the level. So cherish the notion of the fun and hop along for the ride"

","I remembered vaguely not liking this film but when I somehow found myself watching it again recently I couldn't remember why. I actually found the first 35 minutes or so mildly entertaining so I though it was maybe worth giving it another go... I was wrong. As it goes on it just gets more and more annoying. It is just horribly sentimentalized, and it is way too long; seriously, someone should have taken a pair of scissors to that last 30 minutes...it is totally unnecessary and really cringe. I have given it two stars because it not the worst film I have ever seen, but I'll definitely be giving this one a miss next time."

","I'm a guy who really loves Love Actually. As such, I had high expectations for this film. This is a good film, but I'm not sure it quite crosses the threshold for greatness.<br/><br/>Love Actually did a great job of showing different kinds of love--platonic, familial, romantic. About Time also does this well, with a particular focus on family bonds. Tim's relationship with his dad is the most well-developed in the movie, and it's fantastic to watch. I was even close to tears a few times.<br/><br/>My one issue, though, is that Mary, the love of Tim's life, is underdeveloped as a character. The movie spends a lot of time telling us how much he loves her, and doesn't really spend much time telling us *why* he loves her--she's pretty much just a stock, cutesy Rachel McAdams character, without any expressed goals, ambitions, or quirks. We don't have this problem with the other characters--their development is fairly proportional to their importance to Tim. And so, one of the major plot lines falls a bit flat.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, this was still worth seeing. The father-son story makes the movie by itself, and there's more to the story than just those to. I just wish it had balanced those bits with the romantic element better."
"guchrisc","Null","2","7","10 September 2013"," Time-travel tale set in the social set of the Sloan-Rangers and Hooray-Henrys.
","A Universal film. Richard Curtis is on familiar territory in this time-travelling rom-com.<br/><br/>An Englishman discovers that he can travel in time and uses this to try to get a girl.<br/><br/>Those who like the rom-com or time-travel genres will love this film. Director, and Writer, Richard Curtis, has crafted this time-travelling rom-com. It is a natural companion to 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (1994), and 'Notting Hill' (1999). However, whilst both those films were rated 15, 'Another Time' is rated 12A in the UK. Though there should be no criticism of the film; it is not tame, it is not a kids film, but rather an adult film, for adults, that deals with adult themes. Richard Curtis was the Writer in all three films, but in 'AT' he directs too, unlike the previous two films. Camera work is a little wobbly in earlier shots and some music is a little intrusive. Having said that, the two scenes that really featured music, were both beautifully conceived and filmed.<br/><br/>Plot is basic, but to repeat, young man uses time travel to try to get a girl. Some mistakes can be rectified, and futures changed, through the use of time travel. Thus this film is comparable to 'Groundhog Day' (1993). In both films the hero uses time-travel rather selfishly at first, before maturing and using time-travel in a more constructive way. However whilst 'GD' just repeated one day, in 'AT', time-travel is over a longer period of time.<br/><br/>Curiously, Andie Macdowall co-starred in 'GD'. It will be remembered that Miss Macdowall was also in the 'FWaaF' Curtis-vehicle. In his two previous films, 'FWaaF' and 'NH', Mr Curtis had an English-gentleman and an American woman meeting in an upper-class environment. This film is again partially set in London as well as out in the country. Again the social-set is very upper class, lots of girls with awfully posh voices, and there is even an American.<br/><br/>While the characters are interesting, and even stereo-typical silly things clearly have more going on in their lives than is first thought, the social-set being portrayed is very thin indeed. There has been criticism of Richard Curtis in the past for showing a very limited slice of humanity in previous films. The same applies today with this, his newest film. In a recent interview Mr Curtis said he tried to do an urban-Boston film and realized he couldn't do it, so he went back to what he knew.<br/><br/>This is a very good film about the lives of white upper-class liberals, and certainly they will tend to mix with their own kind and set, however it is not acceptable, today, to portray London as a city solely populated by rich whites. There was criticism of the 1999 film 'Notting Hill' for showing Notting Hill as being entirely populated with whites. For the record, Notting Hill has been a very diverse multi-cultural and multi-racial area, for decades, as has been much of London. The Notting Hill Carnival is a vast celebration of Caribbean people and their culture. London also has many, many, working-class people too. Sadly, none of these groups feature in Richard Curtis films at all, except perhaps as menial servers.<br/><br/>You would have thought that fourteen years after 'Notting Hill' that Mr Curtis would have given some thought to writing parts for people of colour and working-class people. Sadly not. Sadly, Mr Curtis has learnt nothing in all these years. He is truly colour-blind. He sees no-one else in his rich white world. This reviewer thought criticism of Richard Curtis's earlier films, for being too rich and white, was a bit harsh. Sadly, I now feel that criticism has not been harsh enough. It is a serious flaw of this film, the writing of it, the casting of it, that once again it inhabits an unreal rich white world, that only exists in the head of Richard Curtis.<br/><br/>Having said all that however, this is a great film. Like his previous films, again here Mr Curtis gives us once again a beautiful rom-com. The time-travel thing is really just a plot device. The core of this film is about relationships. All sorts of relationships, but boy-meets-girl stuff is of course the central core of this film. From start to end we see a bevy of beautiful babes. So too does our hero. He can time-travel to change the past, change the way he interacts with a girl. For this reviewer, the first time was the best and sweetest, just perfect. However as time goes by life gets more complicated and so does the time travel. As the film progresses our hero faces decisions with great consequences. Ordinary mistakes and time-travel mistakes could have devastating consequences. Viewers will watch tensely as decisions are made. As our time-travel hero tries to learn how to live every day, so too may we. The time-travel theme is not the most important theme, so do not worry about it, accept, don't question, just enjoy a film who's central theme is love.<br/><br/>A great supporting cast fill the characters in this film with real life. Rachel McAdams is a real stand out as one of the girls who the time-traveller meets. Domhnall Gleeson is the time-traveller and he too totally convinces as he matures through this film.<br/><br/>If you liked 'Four Weddings' and 'Notting Hill', as well as 'Groundhog', and even enjoyed the romantic elements in 'Timecop' (1994), then this is the film for you. Highly recommended. 9/10."

","I hated '4 weddings...',thought 'Love Actually' was a disappointment & that 'The Love Boat' was Richard Curtis's nadir....However I was pleasantly surprised by 'About Time' - the story was intriguing,the acting was exemplary & the actors were perfectly cast-Bill Nighy does the best 'Bill Nighy ',ever. Once you accept the basic premise,i.e. time travelling,which is not really made a big deal of,you become involved in the possible outcomes of Tim's attempts to alter events & there are lots of unexpected results due to his tinkering with time not panning out as expected. I think that its Richard Curtis's best film, but due to familiarity with his style, may not be so recognised, as a lot of it is on familiar ground with the settings & the characters lifestyle."

","I was completely baited by the high IMDB rating AND the recommendation of a list of movies that're similar to The Groundhog Day. That list listed reasonable entries like Source Code, good ones like Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day, and excellent one like Triangle (really creepy too). And the list put this movie at #1. Sad. Despite noticing some absurdity of the list (it also listed movies like Her, Predestination, Before I Fall ... they're either not really daily-repeating or just bad), I still had high expectations of About Time after seeing its 7.8 IMDB rating.<br/><br/>About Time has comedy potential. It has a completely absurd and illogical time traveling premise that I was expecting the time travel to bring a lot of laugh, but sadly there's nothing funny in the plot. While there were clearly paltry attempts at being funny, they fell way way short. The movie quickly turned into a completely boring RomCom without comedy. The leading characters are not really that likeable, and it's hard to care about their romance. The plot itself isn't even coherent, it's like someone just tried to turn a sitcom episode into a feature length movie. It was a disaster.<br/><br/>So seriously, take my advice, avoid this movie at all cost!"
"edenney01","6","2","8","27 November 2013"," Worth watching, but it wasn't as good as I expected
","I'd probably have to give this 6 out of 10 (I downgraded it from a 7 after further consideration). Girls will probably like this somewhat more than men, but it's not entirely a chick flick. I really enjoyed Love Actually, and I love Rachel McAdams (what guy wouldn't), so coupled with the generally very good reviews I expected to really like this.<br/><br/>The movie is certainly worth seeing and I'm sure some will like it more than others, but overall I just felt like it definitely didn't reach its potential, due in large part to a very poor soundtrack and musical score. I'm 43 and I like a very broad range of music, but I can only think of one song in the entire movie that I was even familiar (""Friday I'm In Love"" by the Cure). Because it played early in the movie and it's a great song, and also because Love Actually had a great soundtrack, I was expecting a lot more. Everybody knows a good score and/or a good soundtrack can make or break a movie, and for me at least, this was just one of those movies where it largely broke it.<br/><br/>I'm guessing I wasn't alone in being somewhat disappointed by the movie, since we were literally the ONLY two people in the theater for a 10:20PM showing in a medium sized Southern California town. That's a little bit late, but certainly not so late that the theater should've been 100% empty. I think I'd have to recommend this one for a Redbox rental when it comes out in 6 months rather than overpaying to see it at the theater."

","The movie was OK. Just OK. I feel like I've seen films similar before. The main character finds out he has time traveling powers and (of course) he uses it to go back in time for things such as finding a girlfriend. This theme is used in pretty much any movie where a character has the opportunity to go back and relive his life. And (of course again)there is a major death which I predicted would happen as soon as I found out that the main character could go back in time. Better yet I also was able to take a guess which character would die. This film did has some good jokes and play-on-words and I liked the acting. When this film comes to theaters around holiday time I'm not sure if the crowds will be rushing to see it."

","See, this is why I shouldn't just play a movie on Netflix without researching it a bit. Had I done my homework, I would've known that ""About Time"" was made by the same nitwit behind ""Love, Actually"" (2003), a movie which is awful, actually. Perhaps, I could've foreseen that, no, this will not be a clever narrative about time travel; it will ruin the fun of it, actually, and all for the sake of sophomoric sentimentality. Movie rom-com love is a powerful force, I will grant you--it can crush all love and intelligence from just about anything, and Richard Curtis seems to be out to prove that.<br/><br/>It should go without saying that the time travel here is nonsensical and breaks nearly every rule it establishes in the first place and invents new ones along the way for plot convenience, or that it's entirely self-centered for the happiness of the creepy hero (no superhero antics for this supernatural egoist; he's content to manipulate the unsuspecting lives of those around him for his own benefit). Even the mixing of time travel with a silly movie romance isn't original (in fact, Rachel McAdams had already starred in another one, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" (2009)), but, then, nothing here is original. This is the same cookie-cutter trifle full of clichÃ©s and stock characters offered to movie-goers over and over again.<br/><br/>Oh, and how condescending to have these moneyed filmmakers with their budgets and revenues of millions of dollars preach to us about money being ""a mixed bag,"" as the father character claims.

But what Curtis is telling us is that Tim manages to be happy only because of his gift which is very pessimistic but most importantly in total contradiction with the optimistic epilogue, completely hypocrite because though Tim concludes by the fact that he is happy and doesn't want to travel back in time anymore, he has used this gift for all the movie to shape a suitable present. <br/><br/>The script is therefore not coherent at all and you will forget this About Time, extremely flat and a lot too long by the way, as soon as it is finished."

","This review is not intended for people intending to watch this movie who do not want to know some of the 'tricks' or plot twists that it includes. Instead, it is intended to provoke thought and consideration amongst those of us who like to watch a film with a critical eye, and think about it afterwards. I cannot believe the number of comments on this site along the lines of this film being 'wonderful/amazing/the best film ever'; I can only conclude that these remarks were made by people with limited experience of movies and / or who are very easily impressed. I only hope that watchers of the film from overseas do not think that the actions of the characters in this movie represent 'typical' British behaviour, or that this film represents the standards of 'typical' British movie making.<br/><br/>My first problem with this film concerns the way that the script appears to have been constructed by Richard Curtis. I was tempted at times to shout out, ""You're making it up as you go along!"" in response to some of the twists in the plot, such as when Tim discovers that there were limits as to how far he could go back in time without changing the gender of his children. Why did his father simply not go back, once again, to when Tim was 21 and comprehensively instruct him in the rules of time travel? Furthermore, the characters are all stock caricatures, who seem to have been chosen from other movies and then checked, probably by a committee of Jocastas and Jeremys, to be 'politically correct' and inoffensive. For example, the playwright that Tim stays with is Mr. Sweary, but lovely beneath the surface, Tim's uncle is corpulent and forgetful, but lovely beneath the surface and his work colleagues are sexist and incompetent, but lovely beneath the surface (have you spotted the common thread yet??) My next 'gripe' concerns the whole idea of using time travel as a movie theme, as it is hardly original - there are so many time travel-based movies that Rachel McAdams herself has been in at least one! The only point in taking on this theme, which flies against one of the fundamental laws of the Universe, namely the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is if it says something new and interesting. As this film contributes less than two of the classics in this genre from the last century, namely 'Groundhog Day' and 'Back to the Future', and is less able to deal with the contradictions that arise than these films were, merely highlights its inadequacies.<br/><br/>Tim, who is yet another caricature, being a geeky 'ginger' (but, naturally, lovely beneath the surface!), makes poor use of the power that his ability to travel in time brings to him. Instead of either using it to make lots of money (for example by visiting a casino or bookmakers), which he could use to help those around him, or to prevent fatalities or solve crimes, he merely uses his abilities to improve his chat-up lines. Selfishly, when he gets the opportunity to prevent his sister from being involved in a serious car accident, he decides not to take it, as it results in his child being born a boy instead of a girl (no, this is not adequately explained either!) Also, if travelling back in time is so simple for Tim that he can achieve it simply by going into a cupboard or small room, closing his eyes and clenching his fists, why had it not happened accidentally to him prior to his 21st birthday? Did he never close his eyes and clench his fists as a teenager? Furthermore, how is it that he is able to 'carry' his sister with him on one occasion - surely she can either travel or time, on her own, or not? I would have been interested to know what the director's instructions to Rachel McAdams were at the start of filming, when she asked him what he wanted from her - presumably 'Look pretty and say your lines, dear', as she delivers little else. If a performance in a movie can be likened to a race she barely does more than jog throughout. Similarly, Domnhall Gleeson was presumably told that he had to show one of two facial expressions, namely either a look of surprise or a look of pretended surprise.<br/><br/>Overall, therefore, this is a silly, bland, unoriginal little film about silly, bland, inoffensive caricatures living their silly, bland, nice lives......"

This is stupid beyond words and one would hope that the screenwriter would go to a dark place and return to the drawing board when initiating this crap. Director Richard Curtis had success with Love Actually but here he seems as if grasping for anything that ignites a subplot. Gleeson and Rachel McAdams survive the material with charm as they have children and Gleeson struggles to use the time travel around them. Other roles arise during crucial moments and then dropped as if an after thought. Bill Nighy plays Tim's father whose one ambition seems to be playing ping pong with his son. Lydia Wilson plays Kit Kat, who seems to be named after a chocolate bar and we are never given a break. Her strong point is a car accident before this becomes unimportant. Margot Robbie plays a beautiful fixation of the Gleeson character where communication is problematic. It has a theme regarding family and the fact that living each day beats the things we cannot change. Overall it is about time we watch a superior comedy on the subject, Groundhog Day. Score: 4 / 10"

","Reading the IMDb synopsis on the movie I was intrigued by the concept thinking it might be more sci-fi about time travel.

","One friend of mine describes Curtis as the Marmite man - you either love him or hate him. Another friend can rant about the failings of Love Actually for so long that I start to replay Shallow Grave in my head and recast him as the poor lodger.<br/><br/>This is Love Actually mark 2. The familiar Curtis characters, gentle English wit and the ain't life grand message, are all present and correct. The only thing missing is Hugh Grant. But Domhall does a lovely impersonation.<br/><br/>Everything was set up perfectly for a great story, one which shows that even with the chance to redo any moment, life goes its own way. Unfortunately Richard never took the opportunity to tell us a story. Instead he delivers one man's life collated in delightful Kodak moments - the kind of life I am sure many a man would have like to have, certainly most of their girlfriends would like to believe so. We have idyllic childhood, bohemian family, endearing romance, with barely a hiccup to mar his perfect existence as the years slide by. <br/><br/>Richard Curtis has said this is his last film and perhaps it is best it is. If he cannot bring himself to write even one day of rain and screaming children into his character's life, does he really have anything to say that a John Lewis ad can't do in a fraction of the time? <br/><br/>Enjoy on a rainy day, take someone you can curl up with, while the rose coloured glasses are still on and see the life you'd like to imagine you might have unfold. Just don't go for a riveting story."

","When I started watching the movie I expected so much more. The beginning was great and then it all got lost as if Richard Curtis could not decide what the story should be about. Should it be about time travelling? Should it be about relationship between son and father? Should it be about the family? About love or about who knows what? Like scattered pieces of puzzle those questions pop up now and then throughout the movie refusing to fall into places to form a wholesome picture. The main protagonist, Tim, has some potential but then he lacks purpose or direction in his actions, he also does not know what to do with his life or his gift of being able to travel back in time. He does appear as nice and caring though so bloody dull and boneless. Supporting characters seem to be on their own, supporting no one in particular. The main heroine is nothing but pretty face who supposedly reads other people's novels. She lacks any interesting traits or lines to say. She is almost like a piece of furniture in the movie and you cannot help but wonder what Tim has found in her... Perhaps their dullness unites them... There are no great wisdoms or even small ones either. Two hours of time claimed but utter banal, trivial, storyless, directionless movie."

I wouldn't say it was bad, but it definitely was too long, it should have been half an hour long and it wouldn't have felt this drawling. I didn't feel anything special about the acting, it felt me wanting a little more drama. I also didn't really get the message, it was, in my opinion, really subtly delivered and maybe a bit weak.

","I saw ""About Time"", starring Domhnall Gleeson-Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 2, True Grit-2010; Rachel McAdams-The Vow, Wedding Crashers; Bill Nighy-Jack the Giant Slayer, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 1 and Lindsay Duncan-Under the Tuscan Sun, Star Wars:Episode 1-The Phantom Menace. <br/><br/>This is a weird time travel/love story. I'm not exactly sure who the target audience is. Domhnall plays a young English lad that finds out-on his 21st birthday-that he can travel into the past and change events. There are a few rules-of course, even in a time travel/love story, you have to have rules. For instance, he can only travel to destinations during his own lifetime-he could not go back and kill Hitler because that was before he was born-and he can not tell anyone about this ability-except for his own son on his 21st birthday. Bill plays his father, that gives him this startling news and Lindsay plays his clueless mother. Rachel plays the American girl that Domhnall uses his new powers to ensnare as a girlfriend and then later, as his wife. There is also a side story about the relationship between Domhnall and Bill. It was rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-I remember partial nudity only, nothing full frontal-and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-It was a pretty typical love story, with the only new twist being the time travel ability-but it would be alright, as a rental. My wife did say that she thought it was a little too long."
"TVfan","6","1","6","8 November 2013"," Worn out Genre
","I had great expectations for this film and went to its first showing (10:25am) on opening day. To my surprise, many people were at the showing.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed, but found Domhnall Gleeson's skill and charm in the leading role the most enjoyable element of this film. But the movie itself felt more like a series of skits. Maybe the skit-like feel supported the central theme of this movie (as with most time-travel movies), namely: live for today, relish every moment. Maybe I just feel like the genre is really worn-out, with not much fresh to offer. I did leave the theater with that ""tell my wife and children how much I love them everyday, every moment"" sort of feeling, but only because I'm extremely sentimental anyway, and need very little to elicit that emotion.<br/><br/>The movie was cast pretty well, but I think Rachel McAdams, at 35, is at the end of her cast-as-a-twenty-something girl. Even bangs/fringe couldn't make me believe it. The film was worth seeing, but save your money and see it on DVD. No rush to see it right away, or need to see it on the big screen."
"writers_reign","6","1","6","7 September 2013"," Clock This
","I've always considered Richard Curtis to be vastly overrated, a pedestrian talent garlanded with Best of Breed gongs by the easily satisfied. This is not to say that I haven't enjoyed isolated moments from Four Weddings, Notting Hill, Love Actually - I had no interest in watching the drivel about pirate radio stations as my interests in that area lie in Real Music. On the other hand the cynic in Curtis has lucked in to the fact that most of us have lost either someone (relative, close friend) or a golden time (childhood, first love) that we would, given the chance, love to revisit albeit briefly, in order to experience profound happiness once again. This is, of course, a time- honoured (sorry about that) device that has informed such properties as It's A Wonderful Life, Carousel, Here Comes Mr. Jordan etc. I am no different to most people in this respect in that I, too, have lost someone, would dearly love to 'go back' even for just a fleeting moment, and am, therefore, susceptible to films like this and recognizing this in myself, am prepared to overlook the flaws noted here by other viewers."

","When I watch time travel movies I hope to be stuck in a story full of paradoxes and that it is difficult to rationally follow the film due to the constant change of time flow, About Time by Richard Curtis is a time travel movie, but the conductive thread of the story is the romance between two young Britons, Tim fulfills his whims thanks to his ability to travel through time by locking himself in a closet and closing his fists as if he were going to hit someone, on one occasion Doc Brown said that if they were going to travel in time they would do it in style, traveling in a Delorean, obviously About Time is not very interested in the science that time travel, temporary fluctuations or paradoxes entail, the most serious thing that caused Time travel in Tim was that his children to change genetically. I was waiting for the moment when the film reached another level of depth, however it always remains on the same level, in fact I realized that one of the big problems of the movie are the female characters, Mary looks like a blank board, no It is a character that undergoes major changes throughout the film, it is a device of the script but it does not work like a real character, the same goes for Tim's mother, however Tim's sister is a very well explored character and she It gives the necessary dramatic touch that the film lacked so much.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie Tim says goodbye to his father, but can really continue to visit him without breaking the rules, Tim's father tells him specifically that he cannot travel before the baby is conceived , so if he travels during pregnancy he would not pass nothing, I'm probably wrong with this, but it is undeniable that at the beginning of the movie it is clear that it is impossible to return to the present once you have returned to the past, however this law is constantly breaking in the film without any reason."

IMHO, the hero's ability to timetravel was underused after the opening act and didn't add anything to an otherwise unremarkable plot.

Literally I've never seen a movie with such a high regard and such a big budget being so consistently insulting to the intelligence of the audience.<br/><br/>All the characters are annoyingly happy all the time (except the guy who hates children, because you know cynical=hates children right? Everybody knows that!). They are either archetypes or bland as hell. The movie hammers CONSTANTLY the theme of LOVE, LOVE LOVE WILL CONQUER THE WORLD to the point it feels like satire or a Saturday morning cartoon. What love?! The guys have no chemistry!!

It's not funny, it serves no purpose and it's soooo cringy...<br/><br/>Cartoonish as well is the script: blatantly artificial and inconsistently paced. I mean, first the movie follows the events with a fairly reasonable timing, then suddenly jumpes off years and years into the future! Hence what you achieve is murdering the tension, and by the way, there is not a single main tension in the movie! You got subplots where there is some tension, it's quickly solved, and suddenly the movie moves on into another time lapse!!! Infuriating!!! I was about to KILL myself with this garbage! No really I mean it, with every choice they make I was feeling sicker and sicker, wandering how retarded this director and writers were.<br/><br/>Margot Robbie is in this movie, and still I'm wondering why, because its character was completely worthless.<br/><br/>Oh and how could I forget? There is time travel in this movie, but I must warn you: it will make even less sense than the usual time travel you see in other movies. And what a surprise! It serves no purpose 85% of the movie. You could erase it from the movie until the ending and the idiotic plot wouldn't be affected!! Furthermore, the reasons the guy travels in time are, until the third act, so idiotic and absurd that I almost thought it was a joke! But no, this stinker of a movie thinks that has heart, that shows how love works (no it doesn't) and believes in these fairy tales not even Disney would buy! If there were some jokes I could let it pass, but nothing: this crap is meant to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Any positives? Well, I guess the dresses are pretty when we are in the wedding. The cinematography is not terrible either.<br/><br/>But the cherry on top is the ending. I guess it's the part that the people praise. Honestly we all know why: because it's a tearjerker.

The idea of if you go back before your child's birth it affects the child seems weird, I don't understand how changing something in your own life can affect an unborn child?

They created a movie about moving in the time but they didn't think over it, they didn't tell all details and rules about it. There are interesting characters in the movie and dramatically theme is created successful. But as I said; If you created a fantastic movie, you can't break your own rules or you should give details and you should explain it."

","I happened to have seen this last night on TV since I never seen it before and decided to check it out. Now this is a time travelling movie so time travel in movies can be sort of a hit and a miss. The likes of Back To The Future,The Terminator,even Kate & Leopold all use some sort of time travelling device in their films and sometimes it can be a little bit far-fetched.<br/><br/>In this film Domhnall Gleason(son of Brendan Gleason)plays Tim a young man in his early 20s who has a family secret. His father,great grandfather and granddad can all travel in time past,present or future. So Tim decides to use it to his advantage by going into a dark room,closing his eyes and his fists tight and then he ends up going into another time frame. Things turn unexpectedly for the young lad as he ends up falling for an American named Mary(Rachel McAdams) who doesn't know that he can time travel. So will something bad happen once he goes in and out of time?<br/><br/>Bottom line I honestly thought this film was rather dull to be honest with you. The time travelling made zero sense to me as all Tim did was close his eyes and his fists tightly goes into dark room and bang his gone to another time frame.<br/><br/>If you like time travelling movies than check it out if not than avoid."

","My opening review on IMDb after using it for many years to confirm or reject my movie viewing choices. This is the first time ever that I have been so out of sync with the IMDb score, that I feel compelled to say something. I can not understand the high rating that this movie gets, I really did not enjoy it at all.<br/><br/>Hated the characters and the absurd and unreal world that they inhabit. Lacking any degree of charm and trying so so hard to be hip and cool. Maybe it is me, but surely people do not converse in the manner portrayed here, it was embarrassing to watch. I like Rom-Coms but this just left me cold.<br/><br/>It did not help, that for me this film suffers badly by comparison to the charming effortless movie, Romantics Anonymous, that I had watched a few days earlier.<br/><br/>Awful film."
"Arconada","6","0","5","27 December 2015"," Why do people like this film?
","Why do people like this film? It's a romantic comedy without a plot. The story-line is simple. Man decides to find a girlfriend, finds one, they marry, have three children, father of the man dies. End of movie. Of course that is not enough to fill a movie, so the director added a twist. The father of the man told him, when he turned 21, that the men of the family are able to travel back in time. All they have to do is to step in a dark secluded space, think of the memory they want to go back to and clench their fist, and voilà! Nice idea to fill the rest of the movie. Unfortunately their are so many flaws in the story, it got annoying to me. It's a nice idea to travel back a few minutes, maybe a day, to redo something that could have been better, but sometimes the steps are major, and at some point the man finds out that his first child is now a son instead of daughter. His father explains him he can't go back before the conception because if he changes the past just a tiny bit, out comes a different child. Nevertheless, unexplained is how he manages to get his daughter back. Another thing, he can travel back in time, but not forward. So he has to relive his live with his changed past. If this is only a few minutes it is quite all right, and there is a funny scene in the movie where there has been taken advantage of that. But to prevent that the movie will get boring by showing the reliving, the director just skips to the present again. So it looks like he travels forward in time as well, but he doesn't. You have to realize that for the major flaw in the end of the movie. The man travels back to the moment his father is still alive, and the father decides to have a father-son moment so he travels some 20 years further back with his son to skip pebbles on the sea. (That is before the moment of conception of his three children!) So now the son, a little boy, has to relive his entire life, remembering all the changes he made to his past to get where he was some 20 years later. But the father will only tell him that he can travel in time when he will be 21. So by then he will probably have forgotten all his changes... However, the end of the movie shows he still managed to redo them all. <br/><br/>This simple romantic comedy has no plot, the time-traveling part is infested with flaws. So, why do people like this film?"

So if I have super power like two man, I want to use only one time when I regret the past mostly. So I watch this film, I notice that it is important to spend a day. We can't extend time, so we should make good use of our time. We can't see our future, of course. So it's interesting and make an effort to spend time. Also, we can't go back the past, we are alive not to regret. So this film makes us notice that we should lead a full life and get happy. So this movie is good."

","This movie was nothing but filler and exposition. All (and I use this term lightly) ""character development"" is delivered through narration. There are so many filler scenes. There is a scene that is literally a black screen with a time stamp and inconsequential filler conversations. There is a scene where the female lead tries on dresses that builds to nothing. There are a few okay jokes, but most of the humour is just sex jokes that pander to sexually frustrated prudes. Nothing more then an isolated chuckle. No gut laughs. The plot is cringe worthy. The protagonist has godly powers, but uses them to hit on a women. You'd think he'd use it to hone his passion or help humanity. Nope. At one point his dad dies of cancer. He could have cured cancer. But nope. The power of boners is stronger. The performances are unbearably cheesy. It's not the fault of the actors. It's the fault of the script and director. New writers are taught to show not tell. Apparently Mr Curtis missed the memo."

","I was really hesitating between 6 and 7, so 6,5 would be my rating. It is certainly cute, but a number of mistakes, inconsistencies and awkward, almost cringe-worthy moments kept me from enjoying the romance. I think they went too far trying to make the main characters relatable, it was too obvious. And the age disparity between the leads was a little bit too much. I also feel like the film had way too many messages, like ""live in the now"" thing. Those might be really helpful if you are young and inexperienced, but for a grown up it looked kind of corny, like a talk between dad and son so long overdue.<br/><br/>I find it really confusing this film has almost the same average rating as Love Actually (even currently higher by 0.1).

","So then lets dive in for a quick one, shall we? A very ginger, lanky clone of martin freeman crossed with Ron from harry potter has a normal, Cornish bred lifestyle with a fairly upper middle/ low upper class family. His father is a seemingly powerful yet carefree man. His mother and sister...relegated in his eyes as simply...mother and sister. However, his love for them remains almost as strong as for his father. His want of his approval, his acceptance and guidance, fore what son couldn't say the same. Or how pleased when a son gets just what he wants. But in this case, what the son gets is a milestone of knowledge, a revelation of insight into a secret that leads to the very secret of life. Without so much as a grand fraternal initiation, a bomb is dropped upon the son, let loose by the father in the supposed joke...of time manipulation. What joys, what travels, what merry may haves and have nots, or maddening misfortunes naught had or not naught had occurred. Though from my standpoint there are many plot holes from a paradoxical minded persons point of view, many things unrealistic ( this movie in the whole, one of them) from a sci fi/ sci possiblists' experience with the genre of mind expanding, science bending ideas. Alas somehow, as if the director could bend the ether themselves, it turned out well. A pull on ones own imagination on what could or shouldn't have been done showed me that I was driven to continue the tale, that it worked to keep me watching, not with action or great mayhem, but simply with the most bizarrely calm , docile minded, understandable fellow mans point of view. And that was the point that was so miraculously well made! laughs had, a general lesson of enjoying the moment, for it is the only true constant and real test of time; no true past or future, just other nows either gone by or yet to let fly in our eye.

Sure, there a few plot holes here and there (that whole thing about not being able to go back before your last child was born is a tad confused) but overall, it's an original spin to staple on a bit of Groundhog Day style ingenuity into what could have been a standard formula.<br/><br/>And sadly, like the aforementioned Bill Murray starrer it does get more than a little corny towards the end, and the long speeches about 'making the most of every day' and how 'life is such a precious gift' made me reach for my patented *MOVIE BARF BUCKET* (It even has my name emblazoned on it!!) and the unbelievably sentimental montage that accompanied them well and truly filled it.

","Overall- Lame.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is the father son relationship, full of quirks as individuals and as a relationship. The dynamic between the actors was beautiful to watch and the writing for these scenes was superb. <br/><br/>Unfortunately that is where the praise ends. There's no chemistry at all in the romantic relationships shown. Not least of which is the main couple. The audience should be rooting for them to get together but sadly, I found myself somewhere between not caring and thinking they were mismatched. This same mismatch occurred with the sister's boyfriend and the guy she assumably marries. Why did she marry him? There's zero chemistry. This same thing happens with both sets of parents. Its like the casting director just grabbed four actors and said, 'yeah....whatever'.<br/><br/>The story is slow and very little happens. The sci-fi in this was unneeded and in fact detracted. This is just another RomCom with a lame scifi excuse to boost watchers. Disappointing!"

But the lines are not so clever/humorous comparing with others directed/written by Richard. Also I think the performance of Rachel McAdams is quite limited by her role.

","The movie is meant to impress you and show you that you already know how to live your life perfectly by living in the moment. However, it fails in the fact that it has so many inconsistencies. On some cases Tim (the main character) absolutely can't travel back in time because it might cause him to have a different baby in the future, so there is a dramatic scene of his last visit with his father and so on; and in the next scene he actually does travel back to his childhood (regardless of his future babies) because he is going to be very careful! so why can't he be ""very careful"" when he goes back to see his dad again? Or the thing about his dad's cancer; it's really hard for me to accept that someone won't go back in time and fix his smoking issues to avoid cancer in the future, simply because he wants to give up. So why doesn't he go back in time and hire a hit-man to shoot him at a certain age that he sees proper for him to die! Or just simply jump off a cliff! And the thing about money, Tim won't travel back in time to become rich because his grand-uncle did it and money cause everyone to hate him. But that's again stupid, you'd think of a solution to become fairly provided without doing too much work. Also it's an insult to the rich class of people, this means you are all hated by everyone around you! Yes, I know all you 7.9 raters would say ""oh, you don't get it .. the movie is not about these childish details .."" .. but I see these weak points in the story as lack of ability of the writer. He could come up with another idea to stop Tim from travelling back in time for money (something like it's inhumane, it's like stealing from other people and for example his dad could make him swear that he would never do that .. or something other than a weak reason). I think the main message of the story is beautiful, but it failed in giving me a consistent movie with strong details. Oh, and Rachel McAdams is gorgeous and AMAZING! as always! :)"

"superduperspit","10","0","4","30 November 2013"," Why this film is a masterpiece
","One of the exhilarating feels as a film fan, is knowing when you've seen a modern classic. A film that breaks a threshold to the next level. About Time is one of those films.<br/><br/>What makes the film great is this. With the history of time travel films, I expected things to go ""wrong"" for Tim halfway through the film. Where time travelling would change his future and this abuse of power would cost him his life with Mary, leading him to change the past more and change it back. At a certain point of the film after changing the past for his sister, I was convinced he'd walk in the door to find himself married to his blond ""first love"" Charlotte in oh-no fashion. But this never happens. The effect of time travel never spins out of control for Tim and in fact much of his life proceeds as if he hardly needed it. Time travel helps Tim fall in love with Mary, but he met her originally and set up a date without it. Marriage, the birth of children and death proceeds as they would have. His sister's life falls apart and her brother helps puts her back together with persuasion and not time travel. Tim's professional life appears to be perfectly normal and unaffected by his powers.<br/><br/>So what's Richard Curtis doing? Why make a time travel film to tell a story that could survive without it and where it never enacts a price on its user? Because this is the point. The great parts of Tim's life - falling in love, children, family and enjoying day to day, aren't because of his time travel. He succeeds by using his powers to live an ordinary life and the great parts that come with it. By the end he doesn't even use it anymore. Tim's journey, real life and the people in it is what makes it extraordinary, not travelling in time.<br/><br/>The title of the film ""About Time"" is perfect. Before seeing the film it sounds as if that's referring to time travel, but in reality it's about the passage of time. From the start of Tim's journey to the end. It's really About Life. Tim's life and journey and the humanity of it represents all of ours. Like much great fantasy films or television, it uses a fantastical concept to show us real things about ourselves.<br/><br/>As if this wasn't enough, About Time is a superbly made film. With this and Love, Actually (I haven't seen Pirate Radio) Richard Curtis proves he is as talented a director as writer. The film is beautifully shot, both filming its characters and its setting to great effect. The dialogue and performances are exceptional and on point, making incredibly lovable characters. It exudes warmth. ""About Time"" is a film is a terrifically crafted and directed film in a way less likely to get credit compared to a ""Gravity"" or ""12 Years A Slave"". The 32% of critics on rottentomatoes.com that graded this a sub-par film, frankly have lost the plot of how to judge filmmaking. They are simply wrong.<br/><br/>""About Time"" is a near perfect film for its genre, following in the footsteps of Love, Actually 10 years ago. It's a modern classic and one of the best films of the last 5 or 10 years."

","You know that saying ""They don't make 'Em like that anymore"". You can't say that after watching this movie. A wonderful film that touches your heart and makes you want to appreciate life more. They could not of cast this movie more perfectly. I haven't seen Domhnall Gleeson any other movies before but I can tell you after this performance I will be on the lookout for his movies. The commercials were saying that this was Rachel McAdams best performance since the Notebook and I could not agree more. Rachel and Domhnall had perfect chemistry on screen.

","This movie was on my watch list ever since I watched the trailer. I knew it was a sweet romance movie but when I finally stepped in the cinema and watch, it was very heart warming and touching. More than I've expected, it's inspiring.<br/><br/>Despite given the ability to relive the past, and dwell in it, one has to simply move on, manage the present and build the future with the loved ones. To live with the imperfects and have a good memory about them. Tim could have let Mary have a drier wedding but they got all the way with the all messed up but memorable wedding.<br/><br/>The movie was mostly narrated by Tim, the lead role in the movie as it was about his life. The genre of the movie was not set to hit the box office, but the casts made viewers feel like living in the story itself. The acts were solid that you could have believed it was real.<br/><br/>The plot was rather flat but we don't expect ups and downs in a person's life, to keep it practical. The love is inspiring.

","You can call it a chick flick if you want but this is purely amazing. Very rarely do you find a modern love story with some far out characters, humor and deep meaningful emotions that all revolve around love and time travel. In the style of Being John Malkovich, Groundhog Day, Midnight In Paris and some Nicholas Sparks flick with a British Flare, the family secret of time travel creates a unique story that is superbly entertaining. You will either walk out the theater with a smile on your face or complain that Rachel McAdams is always in those kind of movies. The characters Kit Kat, played by Lydia Wilson portrays the free flowing sister is hilarious and warm. Vanessa Kirby plays Joanna, the friend of McAdams who sparkles in every one of her scenes as the love story begins to take hold. I hope to see this one several more times."
"insessionfilm","10","0","3","8 November 2013"," About Time is charming and hilarious
","DIRECTION There's not many times that I ridiculously disagree with critics (as a whole) because 60% on Rotten Tomatoes doesn't even come close to how awesome Richard Curtis' About Time really is. About Time is absolutely charming, very funny and explores the entire emotional spectrum really well. Curtis is very straight forward with his story but it's massively engaging and entertaining. One scene involves a band playing at a train station, playing a lovely romantic song as the main characters come back and forth as time keep passes by. Curtis' creative scenes like that stand out, create a fun environment and set the tone well. The actual time travel is uniquely done too and is used for great humor in many cases. Curtis' use of music is done extremely well too and is really appropriate for the different emotional tones we get. This is easily the best Rom-Com of 2013 and is one to see.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>SCRIPT The story is pretty straight forward for the most part but does have some complexity to it later on in the story. The story centers around Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) who discovers the men in his family can travel back in time. And as a youthful man, love is the big thing on his mind. He moves from the countryside of England to the city of London where he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and everything changes. Tim realizes that he can uses his time travel to re-do things without many negative consequences, which is really convenient. But throughout the story, we do find that there are some negative consequences if he's not careful with what he chooses as it does affect his future on some level. What makes this story brilliant, is that it's not very Hollywood. This is where many critics miss the point. It's too predictable that Tim would use time travel to do dumb things, mess up his life, bring in drama, but then fix everything at the end. That's what we need again, right? Wrong. In fact, Curtis sets up those moments really well but instead we get a guy who learns to have fun with his time travel but he's smart and knows exactly what he wants. It's the straight forwardness you wouldn't expect. Instead of it being filled with Hollywood drama, we get a story that's fun, extremely hilarious, and emotional all at the same time. And it's not just a love story. The love aspects blend so well with the father/son relationship story that is just riveting. This story is uniquely told by Curtis and ultimately it's not about the time travel but how one can miss the important details that life can wonderfully make.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>PERFORMANCES Easily one of the funnies performances of the year and wonderfully made for the actors to just have a lot of fun with what they are dong. Domhnall Gleeson is amazing as Tim. He's the shy, awkward young man who doesn't know exactly how to talk to women but knows that love is what he wants. He's really believable as the character and he shines. He especially shines in scenes with Bill Nighy who plays Tim's father. Gleeson and Nighy have some great chemistry and both bring some refreshing humor to the movie. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and while she doesn't have as much to do, she's great for the role she plays. There's one specific scene where she tries on about 20 different dresses that's just brilliant. Lydia Wilson who plays Kit Kat, Tim's younger sister, and she's really funny as the crazy sibling who brings life to the screen. All the rest of the supporting cast is great as well and only brings more humor and life to what this movie is trying to do. If you don't have fun with this cast and story (critics I'm talking to you), then you're really missing the point. Amazing.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>SCORE Nick Laird-Clowes doesn't have a ton on his resume but here Laird-Clowes has some really great melodies that play throughout the film. His main theme is absolutely gorgeous and we hear it many times that just elevates this movie even further. Add to that, an amazing soundtrack list that is full of some really great songs that accompany the film tremendously. The music is crucial in many parts of the film that either bring fun or an emotional element that is really great. Go seek out the music, it's really good.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS About Time isn't a movie about time travel. While it's the main premise of the film, it's really a film about relationships. Yes, perhaps time travel let's them play out the way you want, but who wouldn't want that? And who wouldn't want to spend some more time with their father or people they love if they could? It's the type of story that is just a lot of fun, filled with laughter and is what we all hope for. If you want a drama-filled heart attack, go watch The Walking Dead. About Time is perfect for what it's trying to do.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: A+"

But when he travels back to one night on New Years Eve, he then realizes his abilities. Tim then takes initiative to use his abilities to gain the one thing he desires....a girlfriend. In this process he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), after a few awkward encounters, Tim finally manages to win her heart. But in the process, he also learns there some things in life that cannot be changed.<br/><br/>Director Richard Curtis, who brought us such films as Love Actually, Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary comes another memorable film in his collection. What appears to be a typical romantic film that appears very reminiscent of The Time Traveler's Wife (also starring McAdams), but in reality there is so much more to it than that. The love story is just another aspect of the film. What we are given is a story of a young man who learns of just how much he is capable of with his abilities and the choices he has to overcome with them. The story can go from charming and funny, to deep and emotional with such ease that only Curtis can do, as seen through his aforementioned films. We are also given a very talented cast to help give the story life. Domhnall Gleeson stars as our main star. Gleeson portrays the awkward, but often charming character perfectly that we can't help but relate to. His best scenes however come between him and Billy Nighy, who plays his very funny and spirited father. As we watch their scenes together, their relationship as father and son is so believable that it's always a treat to see them together. Finally, we have the wonderful Rachel McAdams. This time around we have a more charming, bubbly, and often comical version of herself as opposed to the usual character she plays in films such as this. McAdams reminds us just why she has such a large fan base and why she's one of America's sweethearts. The chemistry between Gleeson and McAdams is also something to be noted. While their relationship is more fun and sweet as opposed to romantic, they play this off perfectly. Their scenes together are cute to watch. It's not dynamite chemistry by any means, but it's enjoyable to see the two clearly having fun together.<br/><br/>About Time is charming, deep, and emotional with great substance to it than what the trailers give off. It's cast also does an amazing job of pulling the viewer in. Especially Gleeson and Nighy. All under the brilliant as always vision by Richard Curtis.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"

","'About Time' perhaps not the first movie which includes time traveling in a romantic movie, but it's the most successful one I guess. At first, audience could be quite confuse of this time traveling thing, it isn't explained clearly and seems illogical. However, the movie flows smoothly that make people forget about that thing and enjoy the story. Once again, Richard Kurtis as director and writer has emphasized that he is the one for romantic comedy drama after a clever combination sweet drama in 'Love Actually'. 'About Time' is unexpectedly sweet and no wonder some audiences admittedly cry during seeing this. Some scenes feel really emotional though. The movie is not only focus in the relationship between Tim and Mary, but also the relationship with his family. Also fine performance and chemistry from their entire casts have raised the sweetness from this movie. Overall, 'About Time' is sweet and some scenes are quite hilarious.

","""About Time"" is the story of a slightly socially inept your man, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson). At the age of 21 his father reveals the family secret, all the men in the family can travel back in time, basically having their current consciousness temporarily present in younger versions of themselves. Tim decides to use this ability to get a girlfriend, which at first does not work out so well. However, when he later meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), his abilities come in handy to get a crucial first date to work out well.<br/><br/>The movie goes on to tell the story of Tim and Mary's relationship, and Tim learning the usefulness, and limitations, of his time traveling, to help himself and others. Along the way there are many humorous moments some that work better than others, along with some truly poignant moments, such as the day when Tim has to say goodbye for the very last time to his beloved father.<br/><br/>I saw ""About Time"" in a preview showing last week, and came with hopes for a good movie, but wondered how raw the movie would be (it is rated 'R""), and if it would have all of the typically romantic comedy clichés. I found it to be in general a pleasant movie to watch with characters that I genuinely came to feel like I knew and loved.<br/><br/>While a relatively minor part of the movie, some will be put off a bit by some vulgar language, a few isolated sex related jokes, and the frequent (off screen) premarital sex that leads to one couple getting married due to an unplanned pregnancy. There are a couple of scenes in which Mary is shown in her underwear, once topless, but covering herself with her hands such that nothing is visible. I was actually a bit puzzled that the movie was rated ""R"", since most of this material was not much different from what you can see any day on basic cable television.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson did a convincing job of portraying Tim as a genuinely nice guy who cares about other people and goes out of his way to help people when he can. Rachael McAdams is pleasant as Mary and she and Tim make a nice couple on screen. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie avoided some of the romantic comedy formula, by not having an artificial way to separate and then later get the couple back together. The interactions between Tim and his dad (wonderfully played by Bill Nighy) were touching and realistic (not counting the whole time travel thing).<br/><br/>To sum up the movie was fun, interesting, and really much more pleasant to watch than I had initially thought it might be. It was a true ""science fantasy"" movie, in that it took ordinary people, introduced a fantastic concept, and then let things play out in a fairly realistic way. In the end it also had some surprisingly worthwhile things to say about the importance of making the right choices and living life to the fullest, but did it without hitting you over the head with it. I would gladly see it again sometime and recommend that you strongly consider going to see it yourself."

Anyway the one thing I wish I could do is to be able to travel back in time. I don't want to be able to change history, just to be able to have a redo on something I did. Well that will never happen, but is exactly what ""About Time"" is about.<br/><br/>Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) has just turned 21 and his father (Bill Nighy) has a family secret to tell him. It is nothing like something evolving a dark secret in their past, the secret is that the men of their family can travel back in time. This secret is met with disbelief and doubt and of course the desire to find out if it is true. Tim decides to go back to the night before at his parents New Year's Eve party and kisses a girl at midnight, something he missed on the first time. What would you do with such a gift? Get rich? Make your life perfect? For Tim his choice is to use it for love. Tim now armed with this new ability heads to London to start his life, and to find his true love. It is not long after that he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and Tim uses his gift to correct his mistakes in his courting of her. Tim and Mary start a life together and a family, and Tim discovers that living everyday to its fullest is truly the secret for a happy life.<br/><br/>I know what you are thinking a love story about time travel, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" all over again. Well I have good news for you, even though they both have Rachel McAdams in common, that is the only thing they share. What makes ""About Time"" different? Well that is simple it is written and directed by Richard Curtis (Love Actually). Curtis knows how to tell a love story, he just seems to make the relationships in his movie feel real. We have all heard the ""only in the movies"" line before, but Curtis makes it feel real. ""About Time"" has that feeling, from the awareness of the first time meeting someone, to the feeling you get when you meet the right person. As good as Curtis's material is, it would all be for nothing if it didn't have the right actors. Gleeson and McAdams are magical together, and you can't help to especially enjoy Gleeson's preference. There are so many movies dealing with love and relationships that come out every year. Some are funny, some are sad, but most of them get it wrong, because things that happen in those movies don't happen in real life. Well with ""About Time"" you get something that feels real, and if that is not enough, you get one of the better movies about love that you will see all year, and it is about time for that.<br/><br/>Brian Taylor <br/><br/>http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

The performance by every single actor was superb. I wanted to be a part of this world and now miss my new friends made while living life through Tim.

","Having just made my account and this being my first review you can probably tell that something must have caused me to do so. This film caused just that. I have never seen any more of Richard Curtis' films (yes, not even Love Actually) but I have to say this is one of the greatest British romcoms I have ever seen. I originally was going to see Prisoners on the same day but I'm glad I saw this instead. Yes, strangely, this film does incorporate time travel but this isn't the be all of it. For me, the most awe-inspiring moments were the ones between Gleeson (Tim) and McAdams (Mary) as they both managed to create a very believable and, at many points, hilarious couple. The time-travelling concept was well thought through and was excellently executed in this flick, with a message that touched my heart. Of course I also enjoyed the most important relationship in this movie, between Tim and his father (Nighy), and felt it was a accurate portrayal of the modern day, British, father and son and was believable. The film also engages us in the many struggles of and British adolescent turning into a man, and, of course, the many perks of doing so. Relatable, believable and overall very quirky I felt this film was a great addition to the often overlooked-by-men romcom genre. Some have said this film is slow-paced but at no point in the movie was I bored or did I even turn to a friend and discuss how bad it was. It occasionally was a little slow but I believe this gave me time to really appreciate some of the more affectionate moments of the film."

","Our lives here on earth are measured in time. But what if we could guarantee that every second was well spent? For Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), this becomes a reality, when, on his twenty-first birthday, his father (Bill Nighy) reveals to him that he, along with the males in their family, has the ability to time travel. We follow Tim as he leaves the breathtakingly presented Cornwall in search for a different life in London and, more importantly, a girlfriend. <br/><br/>While displaying the fantastical element of time travel, About Time is firmly rooted in its tale of humanity. Tim encounters the wonderful Mary (Rachel McAdams) by chance, and it is the unfolding of their relationship that forms the narrative of the film. Family life and love intervene masterfully to present their domestic life that I invested hugely in, where small actions (through time traveling) can lead to huge consequences. <br/><br/>The performances are sublime. Domhnall Gleeson demonstrates the ability of an extremely likable leading man, Rachel McAdams embodies the insecurities perfectly of a woman who does not know how perfect she is, and Bill Nighy is simply in his element. <br/><br/>On the one hand I wish more 'Romantic Comedies' were like this, but on the other I don't, as that is what makes this film so unique; genuinely clever, extremely witty, and so full of heart."
"britto-charles","8","0","2","12 October 2013"," About Time, Love, and Life.
","About Time is about a guy and his changes in life when his dad reveals a secret that the men in the family can travel back in time. As the website states "" A new funny film about love. With a bit of time travel."", the sci-fi tag is just a lame excuse. The movie begins as a sci-fi, continues as a rom-com and ends as a family drama. <br/><br/>Richard Curtis known for writing Love Actually and Notting Hill is the writer and director of About Time, produced by Working Title Films and Released by Universal Pictures. The movie stars Domnhall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy in major roles. Who wouldn't be excited to watch a sci-fi rom-com from Richard Curtis, with a promising trailer which reveals most but misdirects(You'll know when you actually watch the film).<br/><br/>Tim(Domnhall Gleeson) has this immense ability to travel back in time, he uses it to find the love of his life. Comical reliefs happen when Tim foolishly uses it to make other's lives happier. RachelMcAdams is adorable as Mary, though I wish Zooey Deschanel has taken up this role. What works in the film is the prime character Tim and his relationships with the people around. The time he spends with his dad, when he's flirtatious with Mary and when he takes care of his sister Kit Kat. All these relationships is what keeps the movie going. The supporting cast are adorable ones like the hippie sis Kit Kat(Lydia Wilson) and the paranoid playwright Harry(Tim Hollander). Sir Richard Griffiths has a minor yet memorable role in this movie.<br/><br/>There are major plot flaws in the movie. The Dad says that only the men can travel back in time but at a point Tim takes his sister back to where she met her boyfriend. The other secret which the dad reveals later in the movie is that one cannot travel back once a child is born as it would lead to the birth of a completely new child, however we see the father and the son go back in time when Tim was a child and still things are normal in the future. The comedy writer in Richard Curtis couldn't resist from breaking his rules to create some brilliant drama.<br/><br/>About Time is a frivolously written sci-fi script by Richard Curtis which is otherwise a heart whelming romantic drama. Its about time you watch it on screens near you."

","About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a socially awkward young adult who finds out he can travel in time (within his own past) and decides to use his powers to find love. The target of his pursuits is the also somewhat awkward Mary (Rachel McAdams). There are definitely some issues regarding the specific mechanics of the time travel, but it is not a big issue, since this is a romantic comedy with time travel elements and not a sci-fi film about time travel. It seems that the film will be a sort of self-induced Groundhog Day with repeated attempts to make Mary fall in love with Tim. Surprisingly, the time travel mechanic is not used much. In the second half of the film it is only used two or three times.<br/><br/>This film is a romantic comedy, meaning it has to check two important boxes: romance and comedy. There is definitely chemistry between the leads. Tim and Mary are very similar: they are both a bit socially awkward, shy, but also very witty. The dialogue between them highlights their similarities and feels very real. Romance: check. The dialogue in the film overall is fantastic, with its British dry wit. Contributing greatly to the comedy are the supporting characters surrounding Tim and Mary like Tim's quirky free-spirited sister or his bitter playwright of a landlord. The scenes between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy) are some of the best in the film. Every character is unique and quirky almost to a fault. Comedy: check Where the movie fails, however, is the plot and plot structure, which is unfortunate considering the interesting concept. A tried and true format for films is to have an overarching conflict that the protagonist tries to solve throughout the film with many obstacles along the way. This keeps the audience invested in every scene. This film does not do that, rather is an episodic series of minor conflicts. There are a scene or two of conflict introduction, then a scene of the conflict being resolved, and then a scene or two of just Tim and Mary just being in love, repeat. The conflicts rarely involve Tim and Mary's relationship at all. For better or for worse it isn't the incredibly formulaic romantic comedy plot structure and on paper this format actually makes sense in keeping with the themes of the film â€“ living life and appreciating life's ups and downs. But this does not translate to screen well. The lack of central tension results in boredom. Also, it means there isn't much of a character arc to Tim. Therefore, when the movie ends, it just sort of happens.<br/><br/>Speaking of the ending, the similarity between this film and Richard Curtis' earlier success Love Actually (2003) is very noticeable. Firstly, the ending of About Time is stylistically identical to the opening of Love Actually, complete with a disembodied voice talking about life and love over shots of random residence of London. The plot missteps can also be traced to the 2003 film. Love Actually is an ensemble comedy with each character having their own conflict and resolution. Lacking one central conflict it works in that film because there is no central protagonist. About Time, on the other hand, is a single protagonist film with a multi-protagonist film structure.<br/><br/>Overall the film is enjoyable despite its shortcomings. There are plenty of embarrassing and hilarious situations that Tim finds himself in. And for those looking for romance, Tim and Mary's relationship is exactly what you want. But the film could've been so much more, with a better structure to the plot and better use of the under-utilized time travel aspect."

Bill Nighy (Tims Dad)is excellent throughout the film and fills the story with the witty lines that break up the serious scenes. <br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch if you can make yourself ignore the time travel aspect of things. (7/10)"

","One of the best romantic comedies that I have seen in the last few years. very good capture of both Cornwall and London and the relationship between Tim and his father (the great bill nigh y) done nicely. Overall a film I recommend to fans of London as well as love actually and Romantic comedies I was glad that Tim goes back a couple of times during the scene at the national theater in glorious south-bank also some nice music in the movie also Nick cave fitted nicely towards the end of the movie last 10-15 minutes were quite moving the relationship with Tim and Mary was also nice nothing over the top and his relationship with his sister also nice. The parts in the national theather were also nice not over the top. at points the movie does feel a little like Groundhog day but its more of a Romantic Comedy compared to Groundhog day. nice cinema outing for Romantic Comedy and London lovers ."

","About Time takes place in the cosy romantic Britain of Richard Curtis, where nervous middle class Englishmen fall head over heels for gorgeous American women. Curtis paints an idealised London of lawyers, playwrights, art galleries and vintage fashion. In the midst of it all is aspiring young lawyer Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who arrives in the capital with new ambition, and a new ability.<br/><br/>For Tim has just been told the family secret by his father (Bill Nighy). He, along with all the other men in his family, is a time traveller, and can rewrite his own history by travelling back to any point along his own timeline (but no killing Hitler). Nighy's matter-of-fact exposition on this matter starts the film; along with Tim's natural incredulity, it is a comic highlight.<br/><br/>But this is a Richard Curtis project, and Tim's future is not a chronicle of epic destiny, but a chance for him to finally meet the girl of his dreams. She arrives swiftly in the form of the expatriated Mary (Rachel McAdams).<br/><br/>Gleeson shines as an atypical leading man, red haired, slightly gangly; at once identifiable and appealing to the audience. McAdams is pleasant, but her character is given little to do. Notably, she never discovers Tim's big secret.<br/><br/>Much of the humour comes from Tim's courtship of Mary, during which he repeats awkward encounters and must meet her for the first time more than once (including a memorable date in London's famously pitch-black Dans le Noir restaurant, a nifty cinematic experiment).<br/><br/>The approach is reminiscent of that other great time travelling romantic comedy, the thoroughly brilliant Groundhog Day (1993). But Tim has a blessing, not a curse, and with complete control over his path, approaches with less cynicism and more ""Let's try that again, shall we?""<br/><br/>So the blend of time travel with a romantic comedy is not entirely original. There is also an inevitable comparison with The Time Traveller's Wife (2009), which also starred Rachel McAdams. Maybe she's stuck in a time loop herself.<br/><br/>As for specifics, the film directly asks you not to question it too much. ""We don't seem to have destroyed civilisation yet"" says Nighy. Some rules rear their head as the narrative progresses, but it's hard to know what the boundaries actually are, and I just watched Primer (2004).<br/><br/>This is not a film about time travel, but a romantic comedy in which time travel furthers the plot. But it is about time: how we choose to spend it, and who we choose to spend it with. And while it's a romance on the face of things, the more interesting relationship, and certainly the more poignant, is between Tim and his father.<br/><br/>At times, it's unashamedly sentimental. The entire film has a softness to it that makes you wonder if Curtis smeared Vaseline on the lens. Curtis even manages to turn a potentially day ruining downpour into a fresh and glorious celebration.<br/><br/>The strength of the writing is in the ability to remain unexpected, and some of this is naturally due to the ability of time travel to allow unexpected things to happen. Conflict appears in unlikely places, and least of all in the relationship between Gleeson and McAdams.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, but for all the derivative and saccharine elements, the central father-son relationship is eloquent, and something rarely explored in this way, especially with this level of British reserve. Though the script is witty, it is only peppered with outright comedy (this is still gold, from the versatile Tom Hollander, fantastic as a jaded slovenly playwright, to Tim's swift cycle through a series of potential best men, complete with appropriate speeches).<br/><br/>Being relatively unfamiliar with his previous works (aside from classic television shows Blackadder and The Vicar of Dibley) About Time has at the very least inspired me to investigate Richard Curtis's other films, which are apparently much stronger."
"sweetever13","6","0","4","11 September 2013"," Film Review
","I'm sure there are many who sneered at Richard Curtis's recent movie called About Time for its simplicity and melancholy but I was not one of them. Rather than sneer as others have done, I took into account his previous work such as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones and therefore expected nothing more than a simple feel good British rom-com. If I wanted to see more of a complex film than I would of opted for the works of James Cameron for example, or generally a director of a entirely different mind who is talented in other respects. The fault lies not within the film itself but within those members of the audience who are trying to find a greater meaning than intended, even the trailer makes About Time reminiscent of Richard Curtis's other films as we see a romance blossom between Tim and Marry . So my question is if you are not a fan of the heart-warming feel good British rom-com then why see it in the first place and criticise it for being exactly this afterwards?<br/><br/>If you take the film for precisely what it is and nothing more than I can find little to criticise. The film of course had all the characteristics of your typical British rom-com with Tim Lake the hopeless romantic, the numerous laugh-out-loud moments but what I consider it to have more than any of his other films is emotion. Rather than it simply being about finding that special someone, it is about the moments we all take for granted as we too like Tim are all at fault of being overly consumed in the hustle, bustle of everyday life. This leaves little time to appreciate each and every moment, each and every exchange with our loved ones and as we along with Tim learn the importance and beauty in doing so, our heartstrings are played like a violin. Once you put what is likely considered as 'naff' to the side, this is a film that will make you tearful to say the least unless you have a heart of stone and it is this I praise About Time for, its ability to pull at the heartstrings to such an extent. I expect after seeing the trailer you may not think a hanky is in need but believe me you really don't want to be without one.<br/><br/>To be fair I would not overly praise Richard Curtis but I find it difficult to dispute his films are exactly what they say on the tin and I know I am not alone in having those moments where all I want to do is sit down, watch a nice, heart-warming film to escape from the drudgery of everyday life. In these moments, despite its naffness About Time and films like it do have a place within all of our hearts, however much some try and dispute this. So why should this film not be praised for offering us this escape and capturing the beauty of life that we allow to pass us by?"
