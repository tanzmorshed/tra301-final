"moviebuffgirl","9","169","196","27 January 2000"," Brief critique-- 9/10 Excellent drama and lyric insight
","I came to the film with low expectations.  I was simply stunned by how good it was.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is an absolutely PHENOMENAL actress. Her performance alone is worth watching the movie for. But unlike show-stoppers like Marissa Tomei in ""My Cousin Vinnie,"" merely shines the brightest light in a luminescent cast.<br/><br/>The cinematography was innovative, but not distractingly so-- ""Girl Interupted"" shines primarily for its dramatic power, not as a mind-blowing work of art. It will not explode your vision of the mundane world in the same way that ""American Beauty"" might, but it will certainly probe you to question your way of seeing the world-- at least psychologically.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder challenged my preconception of her, and proved herself as more than a pretty-girl. Her performance was convincing as Suzanna, a confused high-school graduate who is eloquent and insightful on paper yet unable to a rticulate her own desperate melancholy.<br/><br/>The movie takes place primarily in the women's ward of a mental institution and follows the dynamic friendship between Lisa (Jolie's character) and Suzanna. Lisa is a kinetic, dynamic personality who cuts right to the ""truth"" of things. Her ""truth"" knows no boundaries and she is a controlling person prone to violence. Her piercing insights about people and social recklessness led to her to be institutionalized as a sociopath.<br/><br/>This is not a depressing film. Rather, it is suprisingly life-affirming. Not cloying, not sacherine, but not inpenetrably dark, either.  Anyone seeking an angst-ridden portrayal of abuses in mental institutions should check out Jack Nicholson's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest.""<br/><br/>This film has little of the violent anger of that old classic. Yet it does echo some of the ebulience, the defiance of authority and embracing of freedom at sometimes incalculable cost.<br/><br/>Performances by Whoppie Goldberg (in a serious and nuanced role) and Vanessa Redgrave were excellent, as expected.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few holywood gimmicks, predictable cuts and music, this is a nearly flawless film. Dead-on dramatically, and excellently scripted and based on an eloquent true-story by Suzana Keisen, this movie offers a glimpse of one intensely personal experience of truth. Without the quotation marks, dark cynicism, or pretensions that revelation so frequently entails."

","The absolute best thing about this film are the knockout performances by it's 2 main stars Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie though both characters (hence performances) are very different they stand out nonetheless.  It seems to me to be somewhat easier to play a psychotic than to play a regular neurotic, so who really has the better portrayal of the two?<br/><br/>Brittany Murphy as ""Daisy"" shines in her scenes.  She is a force to reckon with in her future film career.<br/><br/>James Mangold directed this film quite nicely from a very good screenplay; he managed to portray all these young women as young women in turmoil.  No melodrama, no over the top sentimentality, just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives.<br/><br/>It is a heavy drama, so be forewarned!  And a very moving drama at that."

","The most striking and yet most frustrating part of `Girl, Interrupted' is that everybody that's been 19 years old can relate to Susanna, the main character.  Based on her memoir, the film portrays Susanna Kaysen's short stay in a famous mental hospital, supposedly to cure her `borderline personality disorder.'  Set in the late 1960's, Winona Ryder effectively portrays Kaysen.<br/><br/>In a tradition reminiscent of Holden Caulfield, the audience knows there is nothing actually wrong with Kaysen, except that she is a typical teenager, and refuses to conform to the life her parents want for her.  However, after spending some time with her ward mates and numerous doctors, she starts to believe that she is insane, but can't understand why or what exactly is wrong with her.  At one point, she asks a sympathetic nurse (played by Whoopi Goldberg) how she is expected to be cured if she doesn't even understand her illness.  Throughout the film, writer James Mangold's exploration of Kaysen's changing emotions and attempts to understand her `illness' is captivating.<br/><br/>However, even more fascinating than Kaysen herself were the supporting characters.   Perhaps the most striking of these characters though, is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie.  Jolie completely immerses herself in the role, and gives a moving, intriguing  and haunting performance as Susanna's best friend at the hospital.  Although Ryder does an excellent job portraying the earnestness and confusion of her character, Jolie is the true star of this movie.<br/><br/>Adapted from  Kaysen's memoir, the film works well to bring Kaysen's' words to life.  The parts that were altered for the screenplay made sense, allowing the story to translate well to the screen.  Additionally, the length of the film allowed for more depth and details to be explored, which sometimes left out of Kaysen's short novel.  Thus, the film helped add onto and bring more understanding to characters which were introduced in the novel."

","It's always tough in today's goal-obsessed society to be someone who isn't quite sure what they want, but woman and minorities especially have it tough, because they seem to be automatically assigned ""roles"" for them(if you're a woman, even today, people still ask you when you're going to get married; if you're black and look big, people ask if you're an athlete).  In the 60's, author Susanna Kaysen was in a similar position; she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life, but knew she didn't quite fit into the norm.  Because of that, and because of some legitimate problems(she tried to kill herself by swallowing a bottle of aspirin), she went into a mental hospital and was tagged with having ""borderline personality disorder,"" a catch-all phrase which meant whatever the doctors wanted it to mean.  From her experiences in the hospital, Kaysen wrote the book GIRL, INTERRUPTED(the title comes from a Vermeer painting), and now comes the movie version from James Mangold and Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>Mangold's first two films, HEAVY and COPLAND, were both about main characters leading lives of quiet desperation; the pizza chef in HEAVY unable to express himself, and the partly sheriff in COPLAND who must learn to assume his responsibility with that position.  Susanna fits in with those two characters, and Mangold does just as good a job with her, except for some melodramatic scenes near the end.  There are some major themes going on here, like whether Susanna is really crazy, just spoiled, or conditioned to think something is wrong with her, the nature of what ""crazy"" is in the 60's, and of course being a woman at the time, but Mangold avoids making big statements for the most part, instead concentrating on Susanna's growth into being a little more sure of herself.<br/><br/>As has been said before, Ryder brings a lot to the table, not just being a talented actress, but life research, having spent time in a hospital due to exhaustion(this is why she pulled out of GODFATHER PART III as well).  And instead of going for obvious drama, she too just makes Susanna's recovery a gradual and detailed journey, except for those melodramatic scenes.  The first third, which seems to be influence by SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, flashes back and forth through time, as if showing Susanna feeling lost and fragmented.  The rest of the movie is more linear, but Ryder doesn't make it boring.<br/><br/>Some people have dismissed this as a chick ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, which is the usual knee-jerk response whenever a mostly female cast tackles what is normally done with a mostly male cast.  In truth, they're very different movies, primarily because in CUCKOO, we're meant to see the hospital staff, represented by Nurse Ratched, as evil, trying to break down the patients rather than build them up.  Here, on the other hand, while we're meant to see the system's shortcomings(in addition to what I said before, the different meanings of ""promiscuous"" when applied to men and women), the hospital staff is generally seen as trying to do the best they can.  The patients may make fun of the doctors(well-played by Jeffrey Tambor and Vanessa Redgrave) and occasionally challenge the nurses(head nurse Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance in a long time), but there's no real hatred here, except maybe from Lisa.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie certainly has a flashy role with Lisa, the resident sociopath, but makes her seem real, until the movie betrays her at the end. When she's pushing people's buttons, she's actually quite sly about it, which is a lot more multi-dimensional than some have made it out to be.  The rest of the cast playing patients is also good(it was a little heartbreaking seeing Elisabeth Moss playing a burn victim, especially when they show a picture of her as a young girl, where she looks like she did in IMAGINARY CRIMES).  But it's Ryder who is the main reason for seeing this fine movie."

","In more ways than one, 'Girl Interrupted' is very similar to 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest'. To begin with both the films are set in mental institutions and chronicle life as it unfolds amidst those bland, white walls. Characters in both the film are acutely lifelike. But owing perhaps to it being a true story, 'Girl Interrupted' has characters that are much easier to identify with than McMurphy's brigade. Set in the 60's, the film is an account of the times spent in the Mental Institution by an eighteen year girl, Susanna Kaysen, a character portrayed with astonishing brilliance by the versatile Winona Ryder.<br/><br/> Susanna is a victim of neurosis, great expectations, confusion, an uncertain future and the sundry other problems an average teenager's life are pounded with. For all her brilliance, Susanna has the undeniable gift of the cynic and the pessimist, who still hasn't made up her mind about life's meaning and is upset about it. She has the nagging feeling that her character is incomplete and gets caught in the depressing vortex of tendencies that earn her the title of, what we're later told, a border line personality. An almost successful but unintentional suicide attempt lands her in the footsteps of Claymoore, a mental instituition. In the confined borders of the instituition, Susanna is surprised to discover how well she identifies with the pain and flaws of fellow inmates. Here, the atmosphere is sans any prejudice or cliches. Here, everyone is a victim one way or the other. Far from the deplorable world outside the instituition, susanna feels that she's finally home. And it is this atmosphere that slowly gives way to the realisation of her actual needs, her character and her purpose.<br/><br/> In the first half of the film, the director employs an interesting technique of fusing two different scenes and establishing a coherence that not only takes the story forward but at the same time tells us what is already past. Apart from Susanna and maybe Lisa, few characters are generously sketched. This, although, doesn't allow the loosening of the plot's grip on you. Furthermore, the institution is projected in a more agreeable light and the resultant sympathy for the characters ( unlike 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest') does not coincide with an abhorrence towards the angle of treatment. The movie does lead the viewer to understand the plight of the inmates, but not with the object of establishing the reasons that led to their condition. Rather it concentrates on the way these girls face their fate, day in and day out. It also highlights the way the girls identify with each others problems, hopes and desires in a fashion that alternates between being poignant and amusing.<br/><br/> Perhaps the most distinct factor about the movie is the exemplary performances put up by a cast that mostly comprises of females. I haven't seen a film that could hold its own without a single male lead, as good as this movie does. Winona Ryder is very convincing as Susanna. Angelina Jolie delivers so well that I am having a hard time getting over the fact that she agreed to Lara Croft. Whoopi Goldberg is good but her role is regrettably restricted. Constrained performances by all the actresses make this film worthy of being watched. It is funny, sad, mischievous and optimistic all at the same time.<br/><br/> Watch it if you can for it is very unlikely that you would get disappointed. Like I said it is quite likeable!"

","""Borderline personality disorder"" is one of those phrases that says more about the people who invented it than it does about the patient it's supposed to describe. When Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) the 18-year old heroine of ""Girl Interrupted"" enters Claymoore hospital, a psychiatric facility outside Boston, she is diagnosed with the syndrome - but in fact, all she's done is made a hapless suicide attempt and acted slack and mopey and lost in her sober daydreams. Her personality isn't borderline -- it's self-pitying and indulgent. Fortunately, the film understands this. Set in 1967, and adapted from Kaysen's memoir of her two-year experience as an adolescent in the throes of a middle-class crack up, ""Girl Interrupted"" is shrewd, tough and lively - a junior-league ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" that never makes the mistake of portraying its protagonist as a victim-naif. She's more like the original poster child for Prozac Nation: a girl who'd rather interrupt her own life, even if it means going a little crazy, than grow up.<br/><br/>Susanna is thrown in with a turbulent gallery of disturbed young women. They range from a girl who tried to burn her own face off to one who won't eat anything but chicken from her father's deli (she stores the carcasses under the bed). Most of the patients are harmless, but Lisa (Angelina Jolie) a heartless, charismatic sociopath, delights in her destructive power. Jolie brings the kind of combustible sexuality to the screen that our movies, in the age of Meg Ryan have been missing for too long. As Susanna and Lisa become comrades, then enemies, Susanna becomes like a space cadet fighting a secret war with herself, and through Lisa she plays out that war. The film allows Ryder to trace Susanna's gradual emergence from her ""borderline"" state as she confronts the cruel truth of mental illness.<br/><br/>Directed with satisfying authority by James Mangold, ""Girl Interrupted"" is really about the thorny neurotic underside of a contemporary young woman's struggle to leave childhood behind. By the end, you feel that Ryder, at long last, has done that as an actress."
"derek.webster","9","88","114","16 January 2000"," jaundiced beauty, and vaccine of the soul
","How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection.<br/><br/>Winona Rider is equally excellent as the psychologically confused (or is it enlightened?) hero forced to navigate the depths of her own psyche. The interplay between these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the exquisitely painful; but from beginning to end remains capable of leaving you breathless.<br/><br/>Presented with the softly rendered and absorbing visualization of a young girl's decent into psychological insecurity; it is a hauntingly supple progression toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have experienced. If you've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of exceptional melancholy in your life, this film is certain to trigger old fears. But it is also certain to remind you how exquisite and simple salvation can often be.<br/><br/>Refreshingly unlike any of the myriad of fine 'expose' films detailing the darker side of madness (see Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion') or even those with a more poli-social agenda (see Milos Foreman's 'One Flew Over the Cookoo's nest'); 'Girl, Interrupted' achieves a very rare victory in modern film. It conjures enough unnerving insight to bring us scintilatingly close to its most macabre moments; while sewing atop this a spiritual safety net. One capable of the mental restoration that must bring us back to the security of our well cushioned theatre seat. All movement in between remains internal; a lingering memory of personal identification and cathartic resolution.<br/><br/>One look into Angelina Jolie's eyes and you will see the warm, jaundiced decay of a soul no longer battling with sanity. Fear is born of those eyes when you realize how strongly they've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond existential suicide. This film deserves that second look, as well as its painful salvation: a jaundiced beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a lost friend."

","GIRL, INTERRUPTED / (1999) ***1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>""Have you ever confused a dream with life? Or stolen something when you have the cash? Have you ever been blue? Or thought your train moving while sitting still? Maybe I was just crazy. Maybe it was the 60's. Or maybe I was just a girl... interrupted.""<br/><br/>Those are some of the most memorable lines from James Mangold's honest, heartfelt drama ""Girl Interrupted."" The speaker is Susanna Kaysen, played by Winona Ryder. The film is based on the memoir of Kaysen herself, re-encountering the experiences she actually spent in a mental institution after an attempted suicide. The book of the same name was published in 1993; it spent time on almost every best-seller list, including 11 weeks on the New York Times. <br/><br/>It was in the 1980's when Kaysen began to revisit the most formative time in her life-20 years after the actual hospitalization. Memories of a nearly two-year stay at McLean Psychiatric Hospital, a private and exclusive institution near Cambridge, resurfaced while constructing her second book. She began writing vignettes of her experiences in the hospital, writing short stories about a time in her life she had not discussed for two decades.<br/><br/>""The only thing that ever made me less loony was writing,"" remembers Cambridge, Massachusetts-based writer Susanna Kaysen, author of her memoir, ""Girl, Interrupted."" Set in the turbulent 60's, the film details the young Kaysen, who finds herself at a mental institution for disturbed young women. Susanna makes friends, including a seductive and dangerous regular named Lisa (Angelina Jolie). <br/><br/>I have never read this book, but after watching ""Girl, Interrupted"" I am seriously considering it. The film is a powerful exploration into a depressing, bleak situation. When this movie was released theatrically in late 1999, I wondered how many people would want to see something about a young writer who tries to kill herself and then spends time in a nut-house. However, I was wrong to presume anything. ""Girl, Interrupted"" contains a vivid, convincing world for its characters, but never do we feel awkward while watching this film, but involved and concerned. <br/><br/>Screen-adapters James Mangold, Lisa Loomer, and Anna Hamilton Phelan construct a central character that is both consistent and empathetic. As the movie opens, we never see Kaysen's suicide attempt-there is no need to show it. This is a film about the results, not the action. We gradually learn about Kaysen as the movie progresses, thus the lack of initial character development. Even with little introductory material to establish her character, Winona Ryder creates a soothing, intriguing sole for Kaysen. The audience cares about Susanna before we even understand why she was sent to the mental institution.<br/><br/>The film's supporting cast, including Jared Leto, Clea Duvall, Elizabeth Moss, Jeffrey Tambor, Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave, and Angelina Jolie, who won an Academy Award for her performance, actually develops the mood of the film-an essential aspect of its overall impact. James Mangold (""Copland"") has a ambiguous style here, but it works extraordinarily well in this film. ""Girl, Interrupted"" should do wonders for Susanna Kaysen's book; after watching the film, it is hard not to want to read the memoir."

","SPOILERS Let's be honest for a moment. As humanity settles itself into a new millennium, there are so many aspects of life which we remain ignorant about. One aspect in particular is the realm of the human mind. With countless philosophical theories designed to explain the interaction between the brain and the body, science is still at a major loss to explain it. In the modern world we deal with the mentally ill through discussion and pumping them full of drugs. It's a practise which has been in use for decades in one form or another and it remains a practise which treats the ill with a varied degree of success.<br/><br/>If we look back in time at the 1960s however, the process was of a similar format. People would be locked in an institute, pumped full of drugs, and often for the simple fact that their behaviour was different to the social climate. ""Girl, Interrupted"" was a book written by a woman who experienced this case of affairs and whilst altered slightly in story, the film adaptation is a brilliant story which raises more questions about mental health, than it cares to answer.<br/><br/>Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is a ""promiscuous"" rebel who spends her time depressed and pondering her death. With an alternative point of view to people of her time (but a mind-scape that most modern teenage Goths would probably agree with) she finds herself placed in a mental hospital. There she meets interesting people, both doctors and patients, as she tries to come to terms with her own mind.<br/><br/>Sometimes labelled as the female equivalent of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"", ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a clever film which leaves you questioning your mental health throughout. Based on the book by Susanna Kaysen, it has insider information giving it a solid basis.<br/><br/>In the lead role, Winona Ryder gives perhaps her finest performance to date as she questions everything around her before she begins to question herself. Whether she ever really needs the hospital in the first place, or whether it does her any good or not, is open to interpretation, but from the first moments of the film, she keeps us involved with the character and never allows us to stop caring about her.<br/><br/>In a mirror image of Ryder, Angelina Jolie plays the sociopathic Lisa. Coming from a broken home, Lisa is another of these characters who you find it very difficult to understand just how sane she is. Jolie manages to give the character an air of menace throughout the film, whether friendly or aggressive. She provides a solid character, and whilst Ryder arguably deserved more award recognition for her role, Jolie is definitely worthy of the Best Supporting Actress Oscar which she won with this role.<br/><br/>Both women's superb performances are also helped by some great acting by the rest of the cast. Including an impressive Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall, Whoopi Goldberg, Jared Leto and Vanessa Redgrave, the acting is always above standard and hard to fault.<br/><br/>In a time of social revolution, there was (as is ever) a thin line between genius and insanity. Whilst people like Martin Luther King changed the world, there were others who were locked up for mental instability. Whether they were truly insane or not is a difficult question to answer. But set at this time of great importance, it is magnificent films like ""Girl, Interrupted"" that ironically open our minds and get us thinking. Highly recommended."

","I found this film browsing through Netflix's deplorable movie catalogue, and couldn't figure out when did I watched it some time ago. Utterly enjoyable all the way through, I was delighted by Angelina Jolie's performance, I hadn't even remembered she won an Oscar for it, it wasn't until near the end that it hit me. Her performance is truly astounding, she composes her character with traits that perfectly define a person with her mental state. Her mannerisms, her volatile and somewhat unpredictable self makes her a bit frightening, which makes the viewer watch her performance uncomfortable and in awe at the same time.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is great as well, she portrays her different condition in a different manner as expected, perhaps more discreetly, but still effective nonetheless. Overall, most acting performances are on point, such as Clea DuVall, the late Brittany Murphy, Whoopi Goldberg and Elisabeth Moss, they all deserved to be credited.<br/><br/>If you want well-done drama with splendid performances, look no further, and enjoy yourself.

"ZachsMind","6","5","5","1 November 2000"," Girl Interrupted is a delicious exercise in self-indulgence
","Anyone who has ever had an obsession, felt impulses to be drastic over something inconsequential, felt a bit out of place, or ever had in the back of their mind the sinking suspicion that they might be just a little bit crazy should see this film. Girl, Interrupted is rather self-indulgent, like watching children attack a bowl of Halloween candy, or witnessing family members playfully fighting over the last piece of pumpkin pie.<br/><br/>
Is Girl Interrupted really saying crazy people are different from normal people? I don't think so. Alleged crazy people are normal people. They're the ones who say yes to thoughts that other people say no to. Borderlines are people thinking maybe. <br/><br/>Winona Ryder's character Susanna Kaysen (based on the author of the book) is the narrator of this story. It is her 'borderline' eyes that we are peering through. We learn that Susanna flushed a bottle of aspirin down with a bottle of vodka. This leads her parents into carefully goading her into locking herself up inside Claymoore: a mental hospital. She goes willingly but reluctantly, not really paying attention to anything because her mind is filled with echoes of the past, and she deludes herself into becoming delusional. Eventually she is diagnosed as a ""borderline personality disorder."" When compared to the other tenants on her ward in Claymoore however, the more appropriate phrase would be ""psycho wanna-be.""<br/><br/>
Susanna's roommate is a pathological liar who is obsessed with the Oz series of books. Across the hallway is a girl who set herself on fire because she loved her cat. Another refuses to eat because 75 pounds is her ideal weight. So what we witness is a scared teenage girl in the late sixties surrounded by scared girls all rapidly turning into confused young women. We witness Susanna interrupting her own life for a year and a half in order to see in them what she has been, what she is, and what she might become if she crosses the borderline. <br/><br/>Then comes Lisa. <br/><br/>While Winona Ryder plays the tossed raft of this story upon which we skittishly cling, Angelina Jolie appears on the scene like a powerful stormy sea ready to capsize us, blow us off course, or merely keep us company while we navigate the rough waters. Jolie steals the limelight from Ryder while simultaneously making her look good. Ryder holds the show well enough in the start (much like Henry Winkler in the 1982 movie Night Shift before Michael Keaton's entrance), but Jolie's performance of the sociopathic and charismatic Lisa gives this production a needed jumpstart. It also gives us a chance to examine the proceedings from another perspective: Susanna's only just arrived, but Lisa Rowe's been there half her life. While Susanna's borderline, Lisa's already rocked her own boat so far she's drowning, and builds temporary flotation devices by demeaning those around her, but it leaves her dead inside. Somehow Jolie is able to present this hateful person in such a way as to make you want to punch her and hug the stuffing out of her at the same time. <br/><br/>Whoopi Goldberg is a steady rock. While the madness and childishness spreads and recedes like beached waves on an ebbing tide, Whoopi's performance of nurse Valerie lends us a consistent perspective of reason and duty. In one of the more powerful moments of the film, Valerie picks the drugged and lazy Susanna up out of bed and plops her down into a tub filled with cold water. Valerie then tells Susanna in no uncertain terms what we have already surmized by this point: Susanna doesn't belong here. She's not crazy now, but if she drops anchor in Claymoore, she eventually will be.<br/><br/>
Girl, Interrupted is a powerful and moving film about what it means to be sane, what it means to be a social animal, and inevitably what it means to be human. It does get bogged down at times in the messages it tries to convey. Still, the performances of the talent supercede the sometimes preachy dialogue, and move the action along even those times when it appears the story's just running in circles. <br/><br/>The plot is not so much invented in a classic way. After all, this is based on real life, and Kaysen's book is a memoir - a diary. It's real. So there is no real beginning, middle and end. We're told basically why Susanna went in there, we experience some of the highs and lows of her stay, and she tries to show us why she got out. The first time I viewed the film, I found myself wondering towards the end when exactly was it going to end, and how. I was not personally satisfied with the rather ambiguous ending that was finally presented to me, but the slice of life presented to us is an ambiguous one, so ironically it seems fitting, if not satisfying by design. It's not some golden destination of sanity that this film focuses on, but the realization that being socially fit to function in society means to be a part of it, and so it is the journey that keeps us sane.<br/><br/>
The rare references to The Wizard of Oz are just enough to bring light to the metaphor: Susanna is like Dorothy. The people she meets along the way are like the scarecrow, lion and tinman; friends on the journey to getting back out. Claymoore hospital is in a way a land of Oz, either a daydream or a nightmare, depending on how you look at it. And perspective, for someone who believes themselves insane, is everything. <br/><br/>Sanity is not a place, but a state of mind. And after seeing this movie, I was amused at myself: as if I need a film to tell me something that should be so incredibly obvious."

However, no such thing happened. I loved this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone with vision enough to watch it. This movie went beyond the book, adding likability to the characters as it progressed. Winona Ryder did an excellent job portraying the protagonist, and Angelina will make you rewind parts over and over again, especially the part with the cat puppet, which I still say was far too short. Clea DuVall plays the part of Susanna's roommate, and gives one of her best performances yet.

It shows reality as it is! The actors do a really great job and among other acting personalities we can find Whoopie Goldberg, Winona Ryder and Jared Leto which seem just perfect for the roles they embody.

Winona Ryder's performance as a young woman being treated for psychological problems in the all-girl wing of an institution in the late 1960s is very fine; she's mannered at times and a little coy, but she seems a sweet puppet with her wires cut, a bobbing head doll, and one never grows tired of her. Angelina Jolie won a Supporting Oscar as the lead troublemaker, and it is a ferocious bit of acting, but her character is an enigma--playful at times, then cruelly straightforward--and Jolie has to work extra hard to give her depth. I was perplexed by some of Mangold's touches (like having one character commit suicide while listening to the Skeeter Davis record ""The End of the World"", ha ha); but the sneaky trip away from the hospital that Ryder and Jolie take is an amazing section that works rough magic all on its own. Whoopi Goldberg isn't bad as the main nurse on the floor, but a complacent Goldberg is an automatic anticlimax and I don't understand Mangold's casting here. However, the film displays on occasion the work of someone wonderful breaking through, and there are many heartfelt sequences, quick and quirky editing techniques. For anyone bemoaning the obvious (""Not another institution movie!""), this should be a pleasant surprise. *** from ****"

The memoir reads of the stay a young woman had at the same mental hospital that cared for Sylvia Plath and how she questions everything about herself, her life and her planet.

The movie is just a beautiful account of what's happening to a girl, interrupted.<br/><br/>I haven't lived in the sixties either, but somehow the movie seems to tell me  the exact confusion of a young adult at that stage.

","It's always a simple task to relegate a movie or piece of work to a niche in the wall, claiming that it borrows or steals from one thing or another.  In the case of ""Girl, Interrupted,"" it's very easy to say ""It's a 'Cuckoo's Nest' with girls.""  Looking at things on such a superficial level, one could argue that every story steals from all those before it.  But the truth of the matter is that certain ideas are so fundamental, so classical, that they have applied to us for as long as anybody can remember.  If basing a movie on a mental institution and its patients concocts triteness, then basing a movie on love is as much of a sin.<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" places us in the eyes of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a teenage girl who suffers from depression and is signed into the custody of a psychiatric hospital after a failed attempt at suicide.  Like most young people who suffer from this state, Susanna is unable to acknowledge the disorder that affects her.  Seeing things from a practical point of view--believing in cause and effect--makes it difficult for her to understand what she suffers from when she doesn't understand what caused the condition to begin with.<br/><br/>Enter Lisa, faultlessly played by Angelina Jolie.  Beautiful, savage, defiant, and extremely charismatic, she introduces Susanna to a new line of thought: it's the world that's screwed up, not them.  The world is afraid of aberrations such as themselves--people who create a dissonance in the perfect balance of their ideal society.  Thus, they lock them up in mental institutions, and rejoice once that the problem is taken up by the hands of others after the exchange of a sizable amount of cash.<br/><br/>Susanna, needless to say, is enthralled by her new friend;  Lisa is somebody who knows the inner workings of the world, someone to latch onto.  And when one latches onto somebody else in such a manner, either individually or in a group, self-expression and individuality are more often than not sacrificed. Susanna, who was once overwhelmed by the number of choices that confronted her in life, is now ecstatic at the simplicity of her new life in the ward, revolting with Lisa against an unfair system, an unfair world.<br/><br/>At the heart of this film, however, lies a much more fundamental, classical idea:  friendship--what causes it, how it can invigorate us in the worst of times, and its short and long-term effects.  With a beautiful poetic grace, the movie states that it's not the duration of a relationship that matters, but who it is that you befriend, and the place that they earn in your heart while it lasts.  Every relationship in our life is short-lived, as we're continually moving forward in our journey towards a fulfilled existence; time does not stand still, and the film makes a conscious effort to constantly accentuate this point.<br/><br/>For a movie that was almost entirely shot in a hospital ward, the cinematography is exceptionally good.  While it's mostly a character-driven piece, there are a number of interesting shots and tricks that truly place us in the eyes of Susanna, and a few montages that are propelled by what I would consider a perfect soundtrack.  At the forefront, of course, are the actresses themselves, and no words could describe what they've accomplished here.  It's simply astounding.<br/><br/>Though the light that ""Girl, Interrupted"" attempts to place on mentally unstable people is a little questionable at times, it does a nice, subtle job of exposing the puerile nature of a profession which we could nowadays consider an industry.  They're delicate subjects to touch upon, sure.  But in the end, the journey is definitely worth taking.  When I asked myself why I found the manner in which the story was handled so endearing, I recalled one of Winona's most insightful lines: ""Crazy isn't being broken or swallowing a dark secret.  It's you or me...amplified.""<br/><br/>9/10"

","""Girl, Interrupted"" is a 1999 film based off of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of the same name. It follows the protagonist, played by Winona Ryder, as she is institutionalized in Claymoore (McLean Hospital in real life). There, she mingles with a pathological liar (DuVall), a burn victim (Moss), a disturbed daddy's girl (Murphy), an anorexic (Bettis), a dyke (Armenante)—but chief among them is the charming, but heartless sociopath Lisa Rowe, played by Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>What piqued my interest about this film was the immense praise Miss Brother-Smooching Jolie earned for her performance as a female McMurphy. I've never really enjoyed Miss Jolie in general, as her attempts to be quirky and surreal come across as arrogant rather than endearing. However, I will admit that this is a powerhouse performance. Something that Jolie is talented in is portraying authentic reactions to the events surrounding her character. Lisa Rowe is a very generic sociopath who's observed from a bird's eye view, and whatever credibility this character has is betrayed in the second half of the movie; but in spite of it, Angelina isn't trying to force her mannerisms down our throats. It's clear that she's enjoying every trait of her role, but her performance is very raw.<br/><br/>Now, onto Ryder...I am also not a fan of Winona Ryder, as her talent is often stilted by very whiny, self-indulgent characters. She has powerful eyes and can be expressive when she has to, but other films such as ""Alien: Resurrection"" and ""Autumn in New York"" severely waste her talents, as she comes across as bratty and bored rather than enveloping herself in the plot. She is surprisingly decent in this film, but pales in comparison to Jolie. Jolie is fierce and bold in her role as Lisa whereas Winona is fairly stagnant throughout the film. However, there are several scenes where Winona did pull me into her character's drama, particularly when the final showdown occurs between her and Lisa, as well as the final scene between the two (which is admittedly sappy, but the camaraderie does seem genuine at this point).<br/><br/>However, I do have problems with how they portray Susanna Kaysen in this movie. Most of her dialogue is very cloying and morose with little to relate to. They use the term ""Borderline Personality Disorder"" rather than examine the symptoms of BPD. The Susanna portrayed in this film has few scenes that hint at her diagnosis, i.e. her impulsive sexual activity and her brief mentions of depersonalization. There's a lot more to BPD than that. The movie only scrapes the surface of our main character's condition, and it tricks the viewer into believing that BPD is only about being rebellious rather than truly seeing the helpless paranoia they go through.<br/><br/>That leads to another problem in this movie: the characters' diag-nonsenses serve as thinly-written clichés rather than complex development. Both Susanna and Lisa's conditions aren't truly understood and can even come across as childish. The two leads are labeled as ""rebels"" but rarely showcase the truth behind their mental illnesses. I have discussed the phoniness behind the diagnosis of BPD in the film, so I won't drivel on any further than that. Although I have praised Angelina Jolie's authentic and even disturbing performance as Lisa, her character disappointed me. I am unsure if James Mangold really understands sociopathy, as Lisa's breakdown in the end makes no sense whatsoever. A sociopath would not be disarmed because a target is no longer easily manipulated. Sociopaths will find new bait no matter what. Again, if we really delved into Lisa's psyche rather than embellish her Hollywood Bad Girl label, maybe it would be more effective.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, they are portrayed by good actresses, but I wish they were given more screen-time. Some of the nervous breakdowns these characters have never struck a chord with me—such as Polly's self-deprecating freakout because of her scars, and M.G.'s breakdown influenced by Lisa—because I never got to know them. Personally, if Brittany Murphy's portrayal of Daisy Randone was given more development, she would've garnered immense praise as well. The same goes to the other actresses. They all have talent and just by watching them, I can tell that they have the ability to convey raw emotion. However, it's all pushed aside for the Kaysen-Rowe camaraderie that has its ups and downs throughout the film...particularly in the second half.<br/><br/>The events that lead to Susanna and Lisa's final showdown is when the movie succumbed to cheap Hollywood Shark-Jumping. As stated by the real Susanna Kaysen, while she was enchanted by Lisa as the others were, she never had a close bond with her in particular. She and Lisa never ran away together; Daisy did not kill herself because Lisa ""pushed her buttons"", and Lisa never had a mental breakdown because of her deteriorating friendship with Susanna. To say it was ""melodramatic drivel"" would be an understatement. This is where Mangold really misses the point of Kaysen's memoir. The point of the memoir was to examine social nonconformity, and why it is often mistaken for insanity. The atmosphere of the memoir is sacrificed for a cheap plot line that has Susanna go through great denial and impulsivity until she realizes, gasp, Lisa may be crazier than she is. It's one thing to alter some things according to the Law of Adaptation, but sacrificing the entire point of the memoir for the sake of appealing to ""bad girl redeemed"" plot line we've seen over and over truly disgraces the source material.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a guilty pleasure of mine. It appeals more to superficial diagnoses rather than honor the source material, which greatly damaged my expectations for the film. But if you're interested in watching the movie solely for the acting, I suggest you rent this one.<br/><br/>3/10"

Susanna Kaysen is played by Winona whom was hoping for this to be her big comeback to the big screen. However, unlike Winona hoped, Angelina stole the spotlight taking up all the attention for this movie in her role as Lisa Rowe (Susanna's best friend), a sociopath, who takes the movie to extreme limits. Angelina Jolie won a well deserved academy award for best supporting actress for the flick. Definitely one of Angelina's better movies. Fast paced and exciting, Girl, Interrupted is definitely one of the greatest movies of 1999 and deserves all the credit it gets."
"mentalcritic","8","4","5","28 August 2003"," Interesting time capsule...
","From the years 1800 to 1960, very little progress was made in the understanding or treatment of mental illness. Part of this stagnation had to do with the fact that religious repression of medical science was still being shaken off at the time, but the biggest culprit was the inability of society to wake up and realise that just because a fat suit behind a desk said all was well didn't necessarily make it so. Given that Australia calls itself the ""lucky country"" in spite of having the highest youth suicide rate in the entire world, it doesn't appear that we'll be getting over that hurdle any time soon.<br/><br/>But the treatment of the mentally ill in the 1960s is a radically different beast to what it has been since the patenting of Prozac and Zoloft in the mid 1990s. In the 1960s, it was belived by medical staff of all walks that patients of any description had no real rights, and that they had better do what was ordered or look out. Nowadays, hospitals and doctors can be taken to court for trying to make a patient take pills without informing them of what the pills are meant to do. That's one area where progress has been made, and films like this are useful in this way as they provide a bit of information about how things used to be. Maybe in another thirty years, they will make a film about the treatment of mental patients in the 1990s. I'll probably get around to writing my own memoirs by then, so Hollywood can give me a call if they are interested. I have some stories that will make their ears bleed.<br/><br/>That's the one flaw with this film. The results of the primitive and often excessive treatments given in this film are very much prettied-up for the Hollywood audience. The 1960s is a time when such things as Deep Sleep Therapy, a treatment where patients were put into drug-induced comas and given ECT, were thought of as a good idea. Many a patient was killed by this treatment, and to not have such barbarisms mentioned at all in a film that is almost entirely set in a mental hospital is a mistake.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder in the lead role is a bit of a non-event. While it is true that she resembles a lot of archival photos of the real Susanna Kaysen, her flat-as-a-plank delivery makes her patently unconvincing. In a real mental hospital where patients are often climbing the walls, it is truly difficult to believe that this woman would be kept there for the entirety of a day. If anyone needs to know why Angelina Jolie is one of the most well-regarded actors of her generation despite some shocking script choices, this is the film to look at. She truly steals the show here, and absorbs every last bit of audience sympathy. She acts rings around the entire cast, including Whoopi Goldberg.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave this film a seven out of ten. It is just too prettied-up to have any impact, but it does provide an interesting look at how far things have come (as well as remained the same) in around thirty or forty years."
"freydis-e","Null","4","5","28 April 2003"," THE definitive nuthouse film
","This film is very similar to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, inevitably, as it's almost entirely set in a mental hospital, at roughly the same time, in this case the late '60s. Cuckoo's Nest was a great film, but, though flawed, this all-female version based on a true story is better. This review contains spoilers, but only of a general nature.<br/><br/>The plot, concerning a young woman who commits herself following a failed suicide attempt, and is 'cured' more through contact with the other inmates than the rather hapless attempts of staff to help her, is more connected and purposeful than that of Cuckoo's Nest. The supporting cast of inmates here are real people with real backstories, rather than twitching Christopher Lloyds, leering weirdos and silent Indian giants.<br/><br/>The acting is what sets this film apart though. Winona Rider's low-key Susanna is easily a match for Nicholson's McMurphy and Fletcher's Big Nurse, and she's ably supported by a super-straight Whoopi Goldberg (as a nurse) and an interestingly odd Vanessa Redgrave (as the head doctor). But this film is all about the stunning performance by Angelina Jolie, proving that truly great acting sometimes does win Oscars (she got Best Supporting Actress). As the ward's sociopathic 'top dog', Lisa, Jolie flits from the vulnerable and charming to the terrifyingly pitiless, conveying more with half a glance than others can through whole speeches. This is one of the great acting performances of cinema history, all the more astounding as this actor, though always competent, has never produced anything near this level elsewhere. Not to be missed.<br/><br/>There wasn't much about the film I didn't like, but the ending left me feeling dissatisfied. The message almost seems to be that Lisa is the problem and the hospital, however ineffectual, is a kind of solution. In fact Lisa is just as much a victim of the barbaric practices (electric shock therapy, lobotomy, etc) used in psychiatry in those days as McMurphy, but, while we can hate the system that destroys McMurphy - a powerful element of the final payoff in Cuckoo's Nest - it's not so easy here. All the hospital staff, despite varying degrees of competence, are uniformly pleasant and well-meaning, and it's harder to hate a system that contains no hint of any villain. This is a true story of course. I'm not sure how closely the film follows the book, but the truth was that many psychiatric staff in those days were honestly applying damaging treatments which they believed were helping their patients. With the human mind still largely unknown territory, this still happens today.<br/><br/>Though this lack of a villain to hate detracts from the power of the film's conclusion, the brilliantly acted cast of real people with real problems ensures that this is in fact the definitive nuthouse film."

","It is not often I feel I must give 10/10 for a movie, but this is one film I think anybody would be happy to make an exception for. It has gained much by its imaginative casting: Ryder as the new patient with Borderline depression; Jolie as a long time sufferer; Goldberg as the sympathetic but strict care home employee who tries to guide Ryder out of her psychosis.
Of course Jolie steals the show as a long time sufferer who bosses all the inmates including new girl Ryder, and she looks and acts like a true mad woman. Ryder is tempted to indulge her borderline psychosis until a terrible tragedy reshapes her perception of the care home and its inmates. What makes the movie ultimately so touching is the wonderful bond between all the girls who have very different mental health issues, and it many ways this film is completely relevant to the issues of today when mental health is becoming a huge worry for countries everywhere.
Pacing, camera work and scripting are all first rate with no weak links anywhere. No wonder it picked up so many well deserved awards."

","Directed by James Mangold (COPLAND, THE WOLVERINE) and starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, GIRL INTERRUPTED is the adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir about her time spent in Claymoore for attempted suicide. While I do feel like it is a good film, if a little unspectacular or by-the-numbers, I've never liked Winona Ryder that much. She acquits herself nicely here, but her character is rather vanilla and bland, especially compared to the colorful cast of characters she meets while institutionalized. The most interesting (and most developed) of these is Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. While she might be better known as a movie star than as a serious actress these days, this performance came before all of that and, in my opinion, is one of her best. In fact, she gives the best performance in the entire film. In terms of thematic content, there are a lot of things said about insanity and mental health. Also, given the time period of 1967-1968, one could infer commentary on the state of America's mental institutions, especially as they applied to women. There's also some subtle commentary on the Vietnam War, although not to a great extent since that wasn't the main focus of the story. Whatever thematic goals the film may have had, however, pale in comparison to the character work and ensemble cast. As a portrait of life in a mental institution during the late 60's, I thought it was very effective, humorous and occasionally poignant. Brittany Murphy also had a small role as a character who is involved with one of the film's more serious moments. There are a couple more things that I thought about while watching this, one of them amusing and the other quite tragic. The first is a part of the film when Lisa and Susanna escape with the intention of going to Florida and getting jobs at the newly established Disney World. Lisa wants to be Cinderella, which is kind of funny considering that just last year Angelina Jolie played Maleficent for Disney. Not quite the same, but still interesting. The other, and which is a bit of a spoiler, is that Brittany Murphy would eventually meet a tragic end like her character in this film. Anyway, this wasn't some brilliant expose of mental institutions but it did function especially well as a character study. Winona Ryder's character was a bit bland, but only because she was completely upstaged by everyone around her. Recommended, but mostly for Angelina Jolie's performance."

","'Girl Interrupted' is set in a women's mental institution in the late 1960's and based on the autobiography by writer Susanna Kaysen. Winona Ryder plays the lead role as Susanna, who's not so much ""crazy"" as she is a very conflicted and lost young woman. Ryder plays the role convincingly, with a dose of vulnerability, as we watch her character go through her own personal growth and awakening. Ryder has always been a great actress, but Angelina Jolie manages to steal the show as Lisa, the role that brought her mainstream fame and the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2000. Jolie nails the role as the sociopath: she's charming and alluring on the surface, yet also dangerously ruthless and insensitive. She's very compelling as an actress, and this film shows she's more than just a sex symbol. Other supporting actresses include Whoopi Goldberg as the tough yet down-to-earth nurse and Clea Duvall as the pathological liar Georgina, who are also great. 'Girl Interrupted' is a solid film, with interesting subject matter, and is worth the watch."

","Okay, it's a good movie, I've got to admit but these repeated reviewers who add an excited ""True story!"" thing to their comments are way off base. About 70% of the events in this movie didn't happen in real life and we've got to remember that this movie is ""based"" on actual events. I need to clarify some things about Lisa Rowe. She wasn't regarded as the authority over the girls in the ward in real life. She had about as much power and influence in the book as the other girls in the ward had. And there's no way she had keys to everything in the ward. No one could! If a psych patient had one key, let alone keys to everything, the staff would find out and turn her room upside down until they found it. Lisa never said anything to Daisy to push her over the edge. Daisy went over on her own. The girls never went into the tunnels to play bowling and never sneaked into the office to read their files. Lisa and Suzanne never escaped the hospital and went to Daisy's house. Lisa never got a hold of Suzanne's journal and read it to the other girls. And speaking of that, Suzanne didn't say the nasty things about the other girls in her journal that she says here. Much of her comments about them were complimentary. Lisa did escape but was never gone for more than a couple days. Lisa never drugged a nurse and never became homicidal! If Lisa Rowe did the things she does in this movie in real life, she would've spent the majority of her time in maximum security. If you like the movie, great, but please stop saying it's the ""true story""."
"Shaolin_Apu","9","2","2","8 June 2007"," A brief lesson on how to steal a show as a supporting actress
","""Girl, Interrupted"" approaches the social revolution of the sixties from a very special viewpoint: a mental institute into which a young girl is sent because of a rather light excuse. The viewer is likely to find himself or herself from the girl and not from the medical staff or from other ""normal"" people. The girl doesn't seem to be mentally unstable at all if you compare her to the other patients at the institute.<br/><br/>The storyline of ""Girl, Interrupted"" is excellent but that will soon become of only secondary importance because the moment you see Angelina Jolie as Lisa for the first time you'll realize who will steal the show. Even if you are not particularly a fan of Jolie you have to admit that the role was made for her. The sociopath Lisa always keeps something going on and the story will move forward as much as it is possible inside those walls.<br/><br/>Surely you could look for social commentaries from this film but I think that analysis would only say that this is a boring movie, which it is not. You can just relax and forget the social issues, there will be a lot of life going on, and ironically the second best and the worst thing about the film is the very same thing this time: seeing Jolie, Ryder and Murphy as the patients kinda make you want to be in there too, but remember, it's only a movie."

","The dialogue in most movies seems to be an afterthought. Hollywood seems to be more focused on beauty, action, and sex. In Girl Interrupted, the dialogue takes the front seat and the results are amazing. Probably because it is based on a book taken from actual experience, the memorable lines in this movie are endless from start to finish. The 'crazy' people in this movie are full of witty banter and deep psychological feelings. You come out of this movie wishing that everyday 'sane' people were this interesting and multidimensional. Ryder, Jolie, Brittany, & even Goldberg are FANTASTIC. You can tell that this movie meant a lot to all involved - especially Winona. This isn't just a 'chick flick'. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes intelligent, thoughtful, and thoroughly interesting characters. Except for the confusing opening 30 second flashback scene, the movie is practically flawless. I wish all movies were this good."
"saturngoddess1230","9","2","2","15 July 2005"," i have noticed some similarities with ""Girl"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest"".......
","when i first saw ""Girl,Interrrupted"" i was in an outpatient day psych program myself. the staff only showed the first half of the movie, but from that first half, i could tell it was going to be a good one. then the movie finally came on a cable station unedited and i finally saw it from beginning to end. the ""Susanna"" character played by Wynona Ryder was fascinating and at the same time elusive. Daisy, the fragile girl with the eating disorder, was very poignant and for some reason i sensed she would come to a tragic end - which she did - in the movie. Angelina Jolie's ""Lisa"" reminded me of a friend i knew who was reckless in everything she did not to mention insensitive to other people's feelings. she played ""Lisa"" very convincingly to me.<br/><br/>i guess every movie has it's most remembered moments...and it was the saddest moment of the whole movie, and of course, when Daisy committed suicide while this old 60s song, ""The End of the World"" 45 record kept playing over and over. the night before ""Lisa"" had confronted Daisy about what had happened to her as a child, and when Daisy went upstairs somehow i knew she wasn't gonna see the next day. i cried when Susanna called for Daisy the next morning and that sad song was playing and Susanna went up the stairs to Daisy's room and all you saw were Daisy's feet dangling from where she'd hung herself. i was ticked off at Lisa's response ""what an idiot"" -- i felt was very callous and abrasive. but then again that was Lisa's personality -- much like that of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nests"" R.P. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson.<br/><br/>from other posts that i have read, that this movie is comparable to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" based on the book by Ken Kersey, i will admit there are some slight similarities...Angelina Jolie's brassy ""Lisa"" is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's ""R.P. McMurphy"" a swaggering loudmouthed cigarette-smoking rowdy who challenges the ""Big Nurse"" the evil ""Nurse Ratched"". In GI, there is also a head nurse who is the complete opposite of the evil Nurse Ratched, played by Whoopi Goldberg, who plays a more compassionate yet no-nonsense nurse. For those who have seen or have ""One Flew.."" there is also a tragedy in that film as well...after a night of carousing the ward, and Nurse Ratched walking in on all the chaotic aftermath, she goes and shames the one patient who is the most troubled of the group, Billy Bibbit, who eventually goes into the doctor's office and commits suicide by cutting his own throat. Again, a similarly tragic moment when Daisy (Brittney Murphy) hangs herself after an abrasive interaction with Jolie's 'Lisa'. in the ending of both movies, one actually does fly over the cuckoos nest -- the pseudo-deaf Indian, played by the late Will Sampson, and in ""Girl"" Susanna, played by Wynona Ryder. i think that both movies are excellent, with the exception that ""Cuckoo's Nest"" showed a much more gritty side of patient life in a psychiatric hospital, and the use of Etc (electro-convulsive therapy), back in the 60s, and the performing of unnecessary lobotomies. i think if i'm not mistaken, Lisa ends up receiving shock therapy and is put in leather restraints, looking haggard (correct me if i am wrong), but this film does not show the actual procedure taking place. ""GI"" diagnosis of Susanna's character as being ""borderline personality"" to me stands to be corrected...i think a more fitting description would have been major depression, i.e., her suicide attempt and melancholy mood and demeanor. i can say this because i am currently in recovery for depression and i can relate to the symptoms she presented with, and i too have been hospitalized...only my hospitalization was nothing like the ones portrayed in ""Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Girl"". at times i feel mental illness is not accurately portrayed in films, but then again, with today's everchanging times and better treatment of mentally ill patients and the newer meds, these movies (along with ""A Beautiful Mind"")kind of gives the viewer a thumbnail sketch of how serious mental illness can be. and as one of many people who suffer from mental illness, it is good that the movies are now being bold enough to tell these stories and thus raise awareness in the minds of viewers that yes, this can happen to you too."

","Having seen  or partially seen  a few of Whoopie Goldberg's attempts at light-hearted Saturday mid-day fare, I almost did not get settled down for this one. I might well have passed it over as another one of those films which are vulgarly called `chic-flics', seeing such illustrious names as Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie also in the cast. Maybe it was seeing Vanessa Redgrave's name that persuaded me into watching it; I do not know. But whatever I might have been presupposing, I was definitely rather mistaken.<br/><br/>This is a pretty serious film: All the main actresses already named above, as well as Clea Duvall, Brittany Murphy and so on all down the list, turned in excellent performances, with both Ms. Ryder and Ms. Jolie standing out in the main roles. <br/><br/>Based on Susanna Kaysen's book of true experiences in the sixties, James Mangold directed and adapted for screenplay this film, which, almost inevitably, makes us remember and almost obliges us into comparing it with `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', if only because this film is also focussed on life in a mental institution. However, the two films are considerably different. Mangold has worked well on this one, giving just the right angle on the subject matter, and focussing intelligently on characterisation, such that the resulting drama is greatly satisfying. The clashing and fusing of personalities on screen is highly aware and sensitive, which somewhat excludes any ideas of going over the top, though younger viewers  I say under about 30-35  might not agree. Careful analysis of personalities evidently went into the making up of the story-line, and in this respect, Mangold has done a really good job.<br/><br/>I would definitely see this film again; as I have already said elsewhere, I like films which seem to have been adapted from a stage-play, with emphasis on characteriology and useful dialogues. In this, `Girl, Interrupted' scores well for me.                 A good drama to get your teeth into."

","The Sylvia Plath wannabe sensibility gets a waify makeover as the producer-star Winona Ryder throws a pity party for herself. Based on Susanna Kaysen's spare memoir of a year-long stay in the bughouse, the movie suggests Sassy magazine on downers. Ryder is the tremulous heroine, an upper-middle-class daughter driven to the edge by status-crazed martini-sipping parents, and Angelina Jolie wears out her tomboy-cupcake vibe as the rebel hottie who flew over the cuckoo's nest. There are a handful of good scenes in the middle of the movie--in the best, Ryder and Jolie perform an impromptu version of Petula Clark's ""Downtown"" for a depressed patient. But when Whoopi Goldberg, the movie's designated mammy and head nurse, explodes, ""You are a lazy, self-indulgent girl driving yourself crazy!"" it's hard to suppress a standing cheer.<br/><br/>The adaptor-director James Mangold gives the producer-star more adoring closeups since Falconetti played Joan of Arc. Why is it that everyone right now seems to think Mike Nichols is the model for film direction? Mangold's work combines the caricature of THE GRADUATE with the splinters of CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, and his use of sixties music makes FORREST GUMP feel inventive. (I never again want to see a movie where the characters stare openmouthed at a TV set as Fill-in-the-Blank has just been assassinated.) The movie teaches a sigh-inducing slate of girl-power lessons. In the most tiresome, Winona turns down her bohunk boyfriend Jared Leto when he asks her to go into exile with him in Canada; she has to get better with her girlfriends, you see. By the time Winona scrawled in her journal ""IF YOU WERE HERE, YOU'D BE HOME BY NOW,"" I knew this movie had tied GO and RUN LOLA RUN for 1999's most noxious."

","The film's first half-hour plods along as it sloppily tries to set up and explain Susanna's (Ryder) current state. The use of flashback is no problem at first but there are about 4 or 5 flashbacks too many, telling the audience things they have already realised or don't really need to know anyway.<br/><br/>However, after this terrible start, the film bounces back spectacularly once the flashbacks are put aside. This is thanks mainly to the characters in the mental hospital - the sensitive Georgina (DuVall), aggressive but fragile Daisy (Murphy), the childlike Polly (Moss) and, last but definitely not least, Jolie's volatile rebel Lisa.<br/><br/>The film gets better and better as it goes on, the main interest point being the relationship between Lisa and Susanna, but there's a hugely effective subplot concerning Daisy's ordeal, which results in a fantastic and pivotal scene that sends the film into a great final act.<br/><br/>The performances are great. Ryder is more than competent as the subdued Susanna, but DuVall and Murphy are better by perfectly capturing their characters drive (or lack of). It is Jolie that fares best, however, with her snarling, seductive and dominating performance. She makes you hate Lisa but still long for her return, and she deserves all the praise she received.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is effective, at times funny, and a surprisingly good character study. 8/10"

Jolie's performance was powerful. Most of the supporting cast (who generally play the parts of other residents) is solid, but tend to fade into the background for the most part behind Ryder and Jolie. I thought Whoopi Goldberg was strangely cast in a rather limited role as the head nurse of the institution, who consistently challenges Kaysen to get better and get out of the place.<br/><br/>In spite of the generally good performances, though, the story was a bit slow-moving. There were some very powerful scenes, but we seem to have to endure long stretches of relative boredom to get to them. The plodding storyline does move, however, to a strong climax.

","There are some people out there who might like Girl, Interrupted, the latest Winona Ryder movie.  Those people, most of them women, will identify with the soul-paralyzing apathy of the lead character, Susanna (Ryder).  Her descent into an emotionally barren life of empty drudgery is actually based on the autobiography of Susanna Kaysen; her book chronicles the days of her life in the 60's.  Being a true story, very little happens, as most real people lead brain-bleedingly dull lives.  Aside from some angst-ridden whining by Susanna, and her occasional ""adventurous"" tryst with bad-girl antagonist Lisa, this movie still has the same dull heartbeat as many of its doped-up and drooling extras.<br/><br/>Add to the fact that Lisa, the crazy, wild, exhilarating rebel inmate, is played by Angelina ""inflate lips to 40 psi"" Jolie, who is not one of my favorite actresses, as some of you know.<br/><br/>Ryder did a good job.  With a role as self-indulgent as any lead character is in a drama about an emotional journey to self-acceptance, Winona still managed to keep the character fresh without dabbling in any pandering. Jolie, though.  Let me tell you.<br/><br/>Writers like to create crazy characters, by crazy I mean they do all the things we all want to do but don't, and so we don't think they're crazy, but cool and reckless and lonely and wild and sassy.  Hence, we are supposed to like the crazy character, learn a little bit about ourselves, and go home happy.  Jolie's portrayal fails on all three counts, despite fitting the Hollywood stereotype to a T.  Enacting out her cool, textbook version of insane, Jolie sucks all the life out of this film from the word go.  Not that there's much to begin with.<br/><br/>The first quarter of the movie is interesting to watch, only insomuch as it seems to be highly derivative of Vonnegut.  Susanna seems to be ""unstuck in time"" as it were, and events in her life are depicted out of proper context. The suggestion is that Susanna is drifting back and forth between different events.  She's the new millennium's Billy Pilgrim, except this version is written by Nora Ephron.<br/><br/>Well, not really, but that's what it seems like.<br/><br/>The poignancy of the story, its heart and strength, is lost in dull, poetic self-absorption.  It's akin to reading a romantically jilted younger sister's diary; there's so much angst, so much pain, and you really do want to feel sorry for her.  But then you get to an original poem and the first line is ""Darkness fills my empty heart,"" and you guffaw out loud.  Admit it. You do.<br/><br/>Of all the things going for this film--beautiful cinematography, some decent acting, rich subject matter, and even Whoopi Goldberg (turning in an excellent performance as Nurse Valerie)--it is anchored down by an immovable plot and mindless meandering.  It would make a good Lifetime original miniseries, but not much more.<br/><br/>And plus there's ol' fish lips Jolie."

Winona Ryder plays a spoiled, suicidal rich girl with what looks like a repetitive series of ticks and shakes---it's not so much a performance as an overwrought improv exercise in acting class, and not a very convincing one at that. <br/><br/>What we get overall is about as edgy and exciting as an episode of ""Felicity"" set in an isolation ward.  Director James Mangold hamstrings an otherwise talented cast with a goopy, sentimental take on a all-girl's mental ward with a remarkably lax security staff (which lazily seems more to service the narrative than proving a point about the rebellious ingenuity of the gals in this perfectly groomed snake pit); breakouts seem a nightly event and after a point the setting feels more like a valium-drugged sorority than an emotionally tumultuous ward for the emotionally unravelled. For a film about mental illness, Mangold managed to flatline every moment in the film; every confrontation and revelation is staged in the dullest, enervated way possible. <br/><br/>Consistently, every scene announces itself with a Declaration and just as consistently there's no payoff or genuine point; Susanna's final confrontation with Lisa is a laughable dud---for all the script's flailing about Lisa's ""sociopathic"" ability to cut to the quick about the tiresome and self-indulgent mental peccadilloes of the brats around her, it seems unlikely that she would be so undone by Susanna's single ""cutting"" comment, an observation made eons ago by the audience and which could be applied to the movie itself. As for Nurse Whoopie's comment, that Susanna's just ""a spoiled girl making herself crazy"", would that the script itself were so clear-headed---the movie's just as guilty of indulging its characters, so unwilling to take them to task for their neuroses real or imagined, that there's no dramatic investment in sticking around until the last reel."

Men are notlocked up for ""promiscuity"" - men are praised as ""studs"" instead!  Granted, the suicide attempt of Winona's character needed to be addressed but institutionalization was hardly the answer.

","I guess that in Hollywood everything is possible. With this movie Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for being her. Do we have to always waste the awards for a beautiful face? It seems that if you keep doing the same things, and facilitating scandals, you may win an Oscar. When there are so many female actors that deserve this kind of award? But, It's Hollywood. You can not expect to much. Perhaps someday, she will understand the nature of her talents and let us free from her performing roles. Perhaps she may becomes another Mia Farrow and retires voluntary to ""rise"" adopted children. Who knows if she may success being a cool mom, instead of a mediocre actor."

","Ryder and Jolie are outstanding in this movie, giving a realistic feel to the asylum life, small victories by the girls against ""the system"" and a peek into the lives of the psychotic. Jolie steals the spotlight, even though you feel both sorry for her and want to villify her. One of her best movies. Not Ryder's best, but she does a very good job as well. You're on her side throughout the movie, understanding she's really ""not one of the psychos"", yet dealing with mental chaos herself. Well worth watching, some of the scenes are hilarious, especially the one at the ice cream parlor. Whoopie Goldberg does an adequate job as the RN, and you empathize for her situation dealing with girls she desperately wants to help, yet realizes some will never be ready to leave. The scene with Goldberg watching Ryder shave her legs and the rebellious Ryder's comments make you see the teen angst side of a young girl's problems. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies other than those addicted to only action/adventure flicks."

","If you are a prospective viewer or buyer of ""Girl, Interrupted"", don't be mislead by the many comparisons to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", other than the setting in a mental hospital there is little similarity. There is little similarity between the two hospitals and no reason to believe that the ""movie"" adaptation of Kesey's book influenced ""Susanna Kaysen's"" autobiographical story. If you are looking for a film to predict your reaction a much better choice would be ""Ordinary People"". It is fairly safe to say that if you enjoyed that film you will be entertained by ""Girl, Interrupted"". <br/><br/>Although the film was inspired by Kaysen's actual experiences and is told from her point of view (her character is played by Winona Ryder), it is really more allegorical than real; with general themes about freedom, individualism, conformity, and expectations. Unlike ""Cuckoo's Nest"" the villain is not the system but our own internal demons; ""we have met the enemy and he is us"". <br/><br/>This is an ensemble piece and in trying to be character inclusive the film must sacrifice a lot of character depth and development. A really good director would grasp this problem and invent ways to compensate; fleshing out characters with visual behaviors and filling the frame with faces and eyes, including extensive reaction shots. Unfortunately, director James Mangold is pretty much clueless and the absence of tight shots and subtle characterization distances the viewer from the characters and makes it hard to identify or connect. <br/><br/>Still the story is compelling enough to engage most viewers and there are enough stereotypes to just fill in the blanks yourself about several characters. For example, the Julie (Angela Bettis) character, a thin ballerina with an eating disorder, needs little supplemental background information and Angela can just get on with things that move along the storyline. <br/><br/>Kaysen's take on herself and her fellow patients is interesting. Everyone sees little purple men, but you only get locked up for it if you complain about it (insert not conforming here). Then like Dorothy in Oz you can always go home by pronouncing yourself willing to conform, since there was never anything wrong (at least relative to everyone else) in the first place. Diagnosed with a Borderline Personality Disorder, Kaysen's real danger is becoming too comfortable in the sheltered environment of the institution to want to go home. Her thoughts of suicide seem rather silly to her after she is actually confronted with death.<br/><br/>A borderline personality is appropriate for the theme of the story because apparently the psychological community is still uncertain about whether such a classification is even valid. The vague description is of a person born with a tendency to react more intensely to lower levels of stress than others and to take longer to recover; peaking emotionally on less provocation and taking longer coming down (which probably describes almost everyone that you know). <br/><br/>The patients in her ward are messed up in a variety of ways, if the girls in my high school had been this interesting I probably would have married one. Most have found a home in the institution and have little desire to leave. One (Lisa-Angelina Jolie) is manipulatively dangerous with no conscience. She periodically escapes but always returns to sadistically pick on and push the buttons of her captive audience inside. Another (Brittney Murphy) is truly a psychological basket case, of course she is the first one to be released. <br/><br/>Winona does a good job with this role but it does not offer her that much, as the nature of the story requires that Susanna be played in a very constrained way. She is a little too old for the role and her style of playing her characters realistically hurts your perception of her acting when everyone else is carrying on in a expressionistic overplay. <br/><br/>Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg (she plays a perceptive RN) really shine. I'm puzzled by the amount of praise Jolie's performance has received. She is fine in the role but there is nothing difficult here, mostly she just plays herself and occasionally looks like she would enjoy pulling the wings off a few flies. Bettis and Murphy could have handled the role just as well while Jolie would have struggled with their parts. <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

I wanted to write a small review on it now because not many people have commented on the great Brittany Murphy.  Yes, Angelina won the Oscar for this film and of course Ryder was great, but the greatest performance was by Murphy.  Murphy plays Daisy, a chicken obsessed, laxitive junkie who's father likes her a little bit too much.  Murphy brings such great depth and sympathy to her character, making the audience feel her pain.  I was disapointed that she wasn't in the film very much because she shined, but the scenes she is in are amazing. Murphy is one actress with great talent that will be around for years and years to come."

It seems a shame that all this attention is being heaped on the wrong performance in this movie. Winona was okay, and I enjoyed Clea DuVall very much too.

Angelina Jolie plays Lisa Rowe, the asylum's most infamous bigshot patient, and soon both her and the main character (Ryder) scheme to escape from the confines of the hospital. Although they are great actresses, far too much screen time was given to Ryder and Jolie.

Jolie takes over as psycho-Lisa and while the rest of the characters are believable, you don't really get to learn about any of them except Daisy, who is out of the joint before the halfway point. I still don't understand the relationship between Susanna(Ryder) and her parents. ""Don't worry mom/dad, I'll just forget that you led me to the nuthouse and didn't even drop me off, but paid a taxi"". For a self-rightous woman, Susanna gave in pretty easily into signing the papers getting her into the clinic. Overall, the movie was alright, but didn't seem to want to find an ending.

","Some actors are stage actors....and are born to perform on the stage... but Winona Ryder is the most perfectly natural Screen Actress in every sense of the word; she does not even need the theatrical outbursts of speech other actresses needed to demonstrate their acting skills. A bit of fire and tears in the eyes is all she needs ( and what eyes, too!! ) to make her ""speak"", the two alternating in varying degrees of intensity, sometimes simultaneously, and always meaningfully.<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" is neither a work of genius nor a great piece of art by any means. There is more affected cinematic technique and style in it than can be over-looked; much of the montage and the editing is pseudo-'great director', with the names of all the great directors between the parentheses. But what saves it all is the scenario...it has life in it; for a film version of a singularly unfilmable subject, there is a surprising level of ""no-nonsense"" in the screen play.<br/><br/>Susanna Kaysen is an eighteen-year-old who finds herself feeling out of harmony with the society she grew up in and has been part of all her life...depressed, sad and unwell, she takes too many aspirins for the good of either the head-ache or her health. The 'Powers That Be' decide she needs to get oriented back into normalcy in an asylum, where she meets enough disoriented people to give her not only a new vantage view-point of herself and her condition, but also feelings of attachment strong enough for her to cherish. The events that shape the lives of her co-occupants of the asylum and the experiences she shares with them, albeit in a slightly observant role (as befits an aspiring writer), are both purgatory for her and embalming...she comes out of it having obtained enough answers to determine which of the two worlds was more appropriate for her, the closed asylum or the 'stupid' outside world.<br/><br/>The film works only because Winona Ryder could make us SEE every impression each incident made on her within the asylum, and how each occurrence was turning her mental compass to a semblance of normalcy, to the extent that any sane, passionate person could ever be 'normal' enough.<br/><br/>
My rating: 7/10"
"BrianGCrawfordMA","3","5","9","2 January 2011"," Don't believe Kaysen's lies.
","I'm really frustrated with this film, because I want to know more about this woman, and I feel like I'm being lied to in a number of ways. I don't believe Susanna Kaysen tells the truth about herself, and she's admitted as much in interviews. Furthermore, she seems like the kind of person who easily believes her own lies. I also feel like I'm being lied to by her publishers and by feminists who seem to want to ""sanitize"" the details of her life.<br/><br/>The film Girl, Interrupted was, in my opinion, not terrible, but certainly not great. Angelina Jolie acted like everyone's favorite stereotype of a mentally ill woman. I've never been in a posh hospital like McLean, but I have been in other hospitals, including a state hospital, teaching hospitals, and private hospitals. I've seen mentally ill women, and none of them have looked or acted like Angelina. I'm not talking about her purported ""beauty""; I'm just saying that a young woman like that would look way older than her years.<br/><br/>None of the film rang true to me, and I don't want to read the book, because I don't think Kaysen is a reliable narrator. I simply can't suspend disbelief that easily.<br/><br/>I agree with those who believe that Kaysen couldn't possibly have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, because it was just a theory until it became an official diagnosis in 1980 with the release of the DSM-III.<br/><br/>I don't have a grudge against her, because I believe she is legitimately very ill. From what I've read in interviews, she is meanspirited, arrogant, and ungrateful. She tends to use crude language when it's not called for, and her witticisms are either disturbing or simply not funny. I'd just like to find some truth about this woman, and I've tried to find it, but I've come up empty. From what I've found, she's a feminist icon, a genius, and a great writer. I only agree that she's a feminist icon. I would think that someone like Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a more suitable role model, but what the hell do I know? I have a penis.<br/><br/>I don't understand the reviewers who believe that there was nothing wrong with Susanna Kaysen. You've believed her lies. One thing I've learned about people with personality disorders is that they always lie more than the average person, and the average person lies a lot. <br/><br/>Speaking of average people, whoever said that Susanna Kaysen was an average teenager was woefully misinformed. She was born into a family of wealthy and politically influential academics. Her father was an adviser to President Kennedy."

","Girl Interrupted should have re-titled ""Girls Uninteresting"". The story is about a girl who get placed in an asylum set in the mid-60's. There, Winona Rider meets up with Angelina Jolie and from there the fun stops. Suffice it to say that Jolie as the ""Bad Girl"" of the movie was less than convincing. I mean, come on. ANYBODY can smoke cigarettes and say the ""F"" word forty times in the movies. If you don't believe me, see ""Casino"". It goes from boring, to twisted, to psychotic and finishes off at predictable. This movie keeps me guessing as to how Winona Rider ever got as big of a star as she did. She's been in some real stinkers in her career (i.e. ""Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Mermaids"", and now ""Girl, Interrupted"".) Rider could have ended her career at ""Beetlejuice"" and probably would have been better off.<br/><br/>But, all is not lost. For out of the shadows of a painfully boring movie comes Whoopi Goldberg. This move also made me appreciate Goldberg more. She has this gift of taking weak, uninteresting scripts and making them somewhat tolerable. (i.e. ""Clara's Heart"", ""Sister Act II"", and ANY episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") Whoopi was the only thing that kept me from walking out being thankful that my friend paid for this movie and not me.<br/><br/>Girl, Interrupted- *** 3 stars out of 10.

It's as if we're expected to believe each of these nuts were delivered by a stork, without reason, to the mental ward, never to be released again.  What drove these people to such a desolate place?  What drove James Mangold to write and direct such a meandering film?  I must confess that I have not read the novel, upon which this movie is based, and I'm guessing a lot of the questions I, and everyone I have talked to about the movie ""Girl, Interrupted"", have asked are answered between its pages.  Still, not one of us were advised that this movie was merely a companion piece to some depressed rich kid's desolate fantasy.  I feel this movie is a bleak, unwelcoming Cliffnote to something far more profound.

","GIRL, INTERRUPTED gets piled on the same heap as FORREST GUMP and THE English PATIENT; a movie that critics and audiences both loved, even though it is, at its very, very best, quite mediocre.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is one of Hollywood's biggest mysteries. How does someone so boring and limited become such a huge star? Ryder has never delivered what I would call a good performance. She's been decent here and there, but more often that not, she's the weak link in whatever movie she's starring (e.g. LITTLE WOMEN, HEATHERS), and has occasionally just plain sucked (ALIEN Resurrection, MR. DEEDS).<br/><br/>Her performance in this movie falls in between those two areas. There are random moments when she's okay, but whenever she's required to show emotion or angst, her acting is disastrous.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was garnered with egregious amounts of praise for her over-the-top and quite obvious performance. She ACTS, meaning she bugs her eyes, smirks knowingly and delivers her lines with the exact same obnoxious arrogance as every other actor who's ever played a similar ""rebel without a clue."" She's not bad, believe me, but Oscar-worthy? No way.<br/><br/>And, of course, Whoopi Goldberg shows up to play yet another wise, world-weary, heart-of-gold character.<br/><br/>The most interesting aspects of the movie are the supporting performances. Jeffrey Tambor, usually playing comedy, is excellent as a psychiatrist who means well but is ultimately no help to anyone. Brittany Murphy plays her part remarkably well. A character who is repulsed by eating and obsessed with her bowel functions could have very easily been played for laughs, intentionally or otherwise, but Murphy instills so much pent-up sorrow and pain in the character, one can only feel sympathy for her. Clea Duvall and Angela Bettis are also excellent in small supporting roles.<br/><br/>Overall, GIRL, INTERRUPTED is a major misfire. It has a few poignant moments, but is more often contrived and unconvincing. Unfortunately, that describes most movies to come out of Hollywood in the last twenty years."

Mind you, this movie takes place in the 60's and they didn't have as much information on BPD 35 years ago, but they couldn't have been that wrong. Winona is almost the opposite of a BPD; she doesn't have mood swings, is not an alcoholic, she doesn't get angry much, and I could go on. If anything, she could simply be guilty of depression, and an unnatural attraction to death, which would only make her a goth, if the movie took place in modern day.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but now I will look for it, since I want to know whether the movie took too many liberties with the writing."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","2","3","11 May 2016"," A terrific cast of young ladies makes magic
","James Mangold is a director who takes nothing but top shelf scripts and spins them into gold, and Girl Interrupted is a shining example of this. It's based on a book by Susannah Kayson in which she outlines an 18 month stay at a mental ward sometime during the 60's. Mangold adapts her book for the screen, gathers an excellent cast of talented gals and a couple guys, and makes a film that holds up today like it was still it's release week in 1999. Winona Ryder plays Susanna, a reckless girl who is labelled wayward and unstable by her parents, committed to a facility by her stern psychiatrist (Red Forman himself, Kurtwood Smith). She's a little rough around the edges, but one senses the innate sensibility to her that perhaps has been buried under turbulent behaviour not by anything within her, but by the constricting nature of the time period she has been born into. In any case, she finds herself thrown into an environment she didn't expect, with many other girls, some of which she clashes with, some of which she ends up befriending, and one that.. well, defies classification, really. The girl in question is Lisa, played by a fantastically fired up Angelina Jolie who nearly combusts upon herself in her furious performance. Lisa has been dubbed nearly unable to treat, yet simply has the kind of soul that doesn't fit into a box, let alone lend itself to scholarly dissection. Ice cool one moment, a raging typhoon the next, and holding a dense riot shield over any trace of her true emotions every second, she's an enigmatic, elemental wild card. It's the best work I've ever seen from Jolie, getting her a well earned Oscar nod. She teaches Susanna some lessons that only people on that side of the glass can comprehend, confounding the facility's head doctor (Vanessa Redgrave) and puzzling a kind orderly (Whoopi Goldberg), two rational people who simply can't understand the kind resolution and companionship that often comes out of irrational, unconventional interaction that almost always is seen as 'unstable'. Ryder is pitch perfect and carries her share of the load, but despite being the protagonist, it's Jolie's show all the way. She's unbelievably good and will break the heart of both first time viewers and veterans who put the DVD in every so often for a tearful revisit. The late Brittany Murphy is great as Daisy, another complicated girl, and Clea Duvall scores points as Georgina, the shy and reserved one. There's also work from Jared Leto Elizabeth Moss, Angela Bettis, Bruce Altman, Mary Kay Place, Kadee Strickland, Misha Collins and Jeffrey Tambor. Tender, patient and non judgmental are qualities which are essential in films of this subject matter, as well as empathy from both viewer and filmmaker, to take a look at these girls and even though we may not understand what is going on with them or their beaviour, to simply bear witness, and be there for them. Mangold knows this and acts accordingly, leading to a beautiful film of the highest order. Viewers are sure to do the same, completing the artistic ring full circle."

One of which is Lisa an apparent sociopath who cleverly manipulates everyone around her and is unable to feel any empathy. <br/><br/>The two girls hit things off and a toxic friendship begins in which we see Lisa slowly drag Susanna into her bleak world. <br/><br/>What make's this movie great is the incredibly well written young female characters which is so hard to come across, with each actress delivering an amazing performance giving this movie a sense of great realism. <br/><br/>As Susanna sets upon the quest to discover her true self and find out if she is really sane we are forced to ask the question, Is it the institution that makes her crazy or did she have deep seeded problems she chose to lock away all along?"

At the age of 18, Susanna's life wasn't quite what the life of a ""normal"" eighteen-year-old was supposed to be like. She wasn't a least bit interested about the conventional social behavior, fell asleep at the graduation, went to bed with her mother's friend's husband, liked to write and didn't show any particular interest for college.<br/><br/>One night, due to an excruciating headache, Susanna swallowed a bottle of aspirin and a bottle of vodka to get it down. Bewildered by their daughter's gesture and eager to fulfill their duty as parents, the Kaysens delegated a psychiatrist, friend of the family, to submit her to a local mental institution.<br/><br/>Once there, Susanna made new friends: Georgina, a pathological lier, Polly  a young woman with the intellect of a twelve-year-old, who had been badly scarred in a fire, Daisy  a secluded anorexic who had been sexually abused by her father and a rebellious captivating sociopath called Lisa.<br/><br/>During the day, the girls would trick the nurses to avoid swallowing their pills, which they would afterward exchange among them like candy, while during the night they would force the entrance of the private offices, wonder on the corridors and play bowling in the basement of the mental hospital.<br/><br/>Things were getting along fine, just like in the Land of Oz, where people were special, not different, it was strictly up to Dorothy to return to the real world, and all they ever wanted was at reach waiting for them to understand it. The characters were somehow different from the ones in the story, but that made little importance. There was Georgina, a Dorothy wannabe who would invent herself a new story every day, Polly, whose only wish was to be a child forever, Lisa, a professional Cinderella and Toby, Susanna's ex-fling, an untalented prince who failed to convince Susanna to run away with him. There was also Dr. Crumble, a fat scarecrow born without a brain, Dr. Wick, the almighty Wizzard who could send any of them home at the wink of an eye, nurse Valery, the bad witch who would afterward play the role of the Fairy Godmother without anyone knowing how or when the change took place.

","Girl, Interrupted is a memoir about a woman who stayed in a Mental Hospital for a while, and retells of the people she interacted with during her stay, and the characters in this movie are portrayed very well, as specially the character of Lisa Rowe.

Her character is a sociopath, and you can tell before the film even tells you.

","Girl Interrupted takes us on a journey into the lives of approximately 6 young women who are coping with differing mental illnesses in a mental facility.<br/><br/>Their illnesses are magnified by the uncertain times of the 60's, which the film time-line is set in. The Vietnam war, the struggles of the gender wars of the times, along with so many other issues that the 60's brought about are focused upon as well. Susanna (Ryder) and Lisa (Jolie) our main characters, along with a small group of others make it easy for us to bond with, and have strong ideals of how we want their lives to turn out. <br/><br/>Jolie has once again proved she sets herself apart from other actresses, as she takes hold of this character and nails it. She is a delicious sociopath. She uses and owns the ward. Ryder also does a good job with her character.<br/><br/>I believe that Ryder was a very confused young woman, she took the 60's hard, her feelings ruled her. She had to find a purpose for her life in order to get past the block she was facing in her life. She is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. <br/><br/>Although the group of women bonded, and they could help each other out by listening, they could not heal each other. Ryder soon learned that in order to heal and get out of the hospital was to work on herself. She needed to turn all her feelings into something constructive. She needed to stop hiding from what she fears. After a traumatic experience, and seeing Jolie for what she really was inside, she began to work on her recovery. She saw that Jolie was not the answer to getting out of the hospital. <br/><br/>There are many great scenes in the movie, the movie did a good job of depicting a mental facility in the 60's. Well at least for those with money. The only real staff member that you meet and have feelings for one way or another is Goldberg (nurse Owens) who did a good job, I enjoyed the way she tried to help the young women in her own way. <br/><br/>All in all I would say this movie was great. There was not a moment when I didn't identify with at least one or more of the characters. The actors kept you enticed. <br/><br/>There were a lot of cut scenes, flashbacks, but I honestly didn't mind them, they were understandable and not confusing as so many films seem to be. <br/><br/>10/10"

"TheMovieDiorama","7","1","1","13 September 2019"," Girl, Interrupted abruptly infiltrates mental conditions through a solid, albeit inconsistent, characterised plot.
","There's only one film that truly tackles mental institutionalisation with enough heft and characterisation, that it remains the superior benchmark for all subsequent topical features. 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. Mangold's adaptation may not be in the same league as the aforementioned near-perfect drama, yet he serves up one of the most talented ensemble casts of the late 90s. Each performance turning in a level of emotional connectivity that, whilst subsequently diminished the darker tones, interrupted our thought process with genuine characters that emanated fragility and heart. A young girl's parents have their daughter institutionalised on the basis that she nearly tried to commit suicide, not aware that her mentality is actually intact, to which she finds herself enthralled by the other girls within the hospital.<br/><br/>Mangold's intentions weren't necessarily to comment on the system's capitalisation of business over patient welfare, but to grant audiences a window into a splintered group of friends. Blossoming friendships in the confined spaces of an imprisoned environment. A minuscule community driven on the reliance of each other, despite the frantic and erratic schizophrenic behaviours of the patients. His screenplay mimics the close proximity of these patients by intrinsically focusing on their relationships with each other. Divulging into their tainted pasts and current daily routines. Like I said, it's never an examination of the system, but an insight into the patients' residence. It's all the better for it, and oozed so much characterisation that it's nearly impossible to resist.<br/><br/>What aided in the emotional vulnerability of these girls, were the performances. Ryder gave a career best in a role that clearly meant something to her. The innocence, fragility and sharp tongue. The perfect lead character. A supporting cast comprising of Goldberg, Tambor, Moss, Leto and Murphy ensured high calibre performances, and they all delivered. Of course though, there's one performance that stole the spotlight. That one flickering light of excellence that made the film as memorable as it is today. Angelina Jolie. Her ferocity allowed her character to earn a commanding presence. A presence that chewed up every scene she was in. The alternative style clearly differing from her colleagues. The bitter lines of dialogue that made her unapproachable yet empathetic. No surprise that she won an onslaught of awards, it's one of her greatest performances.<br/><br/>The narrative however falters on several occasions. There were frequent moments of darkness within this tale of hope, juxtaposing the lighter tone set in the first half of the film. These moments unfortunately had no staying power and heightened an unnecessary amount of melodrama. The bathroom suicide scene for example, and the rushed final night at the hospital. Exploration into borderline personality disorder was also lacking. These blinded scenes in tackling the darkness of mental illness had no conviction, and instead hurried the thinly plotted narrative along to its predictable conclusion. Which is a dire shame considering the intricate development of the characters. The bland score also attempted to enhance that acute sense of dramatic power, yet instead felt clinical. And finally the film is set in the 60s, yet strangely the wardrobe felt very modern and didn't necessarily suit the decade it was attempting to portray.<br/><br/>Despite these reserved withdrawals, the performances and fleshed out character development alone were enough to prevent Girl from continually being Interrupted. Implanting solid foundations into a splintered narrative casually observing mental illness, producing emotional resonance during its conclusion."

","This adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir of a year spent in a mental institution is filled with terrific elements and outstanding scenes, but taken as a whole there seems to be something missing. It's certainly not the performances, which are all strong: While Angelina Jolie tears into her role with gusto and no restraint, Winona Ryder instead delivers an understated, carefully studied performance that anchors the narrative. However, there often seems to be too much and not enough going on at once, and by the time the strange, tonally inconsistent climax rolls around it's hard not to notice that director James Mangold has lost control of the movie. But the elements that work well manage to elevate the overall experience, from a well-selected collection of era-specific music to the strong ensemble acting."

","""Girl, Interrupted"" is a Biography - Drama movie which is based on the 18-month stay of Susanna Kaysen's at a mental hospital in the 1960s. Since she had many difficulties to cope with reality and all the difficulties that have to surpass in order to actually live on it she was hospitalized at a very well known mental hospital. There she met many other women and with some of those she considered them as friends. Especially with one of those she created a special bond which was very difficult to break and be able to continue her therapy.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it was based on a real-life story which I found very interesting. I believe that this period of life was remained in Susanna Kaysen's memory for a long time not to say in the whole duration of it because it was something very important for her since she learned more not only about other people but for herself too in combination with the reality of course. I liked the interpretations of Winona Ryder who played as Susanna Kaysen and she was very good at it and Angelina Jolie who played as Lisa and I believe it was her best performance so far (won the Academy Award for the Best Actress in a Supporting Role on 2000). Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Brittany Murphy's who played as Daisy and she was equally good. About the direction which was made by James Mangold I have to say that it was very interesting and he combined very well drama moments with funny ones but from the perspective of the unstable people, something very hard to succeed on it.<br/><br/>Finally, I believe that ""Girl, Interrupted"" is an interesting movie to watch, with many good scenes, a great plot and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I believe that everyone has something to gain from it in a matter of understanding of how easy is to become one of those people and that is extremely close the one side of mental health to another where you are unstable or sick."
"filmchaser","Null","1","1","12 February 2013"," Girls Trying to Tell Us Something
","This is my second viewing, having watched this film when it first came out. So...by now, the careers of Ryder, Jolie, Duvall, Moss, and the late Murphy have all processed through the Hollywood machine, and the only ones left standing are: Jolie, Duvall, and Moss. So this time when I watched this film, I saw something different in Ryder and Jolie. And what I saw was that they had been perfectly cast as themselves. Ryder looked overworked, underweight, and tired. Jolie appeared flippant about serious underlying rage, and slipped in and out of extreme emotions as she tore a path of destruction behind her with all those she vented onto.<br/><br/>Somehow, this didn't seem to be a stretch for either of the actors because based on what I've read about Ryder, she was suffering from extreme fatigue and exhaustion; and Jolie spent several years in the tabloids proving how an angry teenager turns into a crazy young adult who likes to do shocking things for attention. Wow. And she received awards for this. Nonetheless, the cast was very good, and the general tone of the movie was captivating and realistic while maintaining its value as ENTERTAINMENT, for all those reviewers who believe art should imitate the true grit of life. No, please. That's why we like films. Because they give us something to look forward to next time; because they allow the viewer to escape for awhile. <br/><br/>It's very difficult to put all the details of one person's descent into mental illness into a one-and-a-half-hour of time, as anyone knows who watched A Beautiful Mind. So good job to the screenwriter and the director. This film is cleverly written, acted, directed, and produced because it slowly, imperceptibly, and progressively makes the mental institution appear safer than the world outside; which is illustrated toward the end of the film when the kind nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg tells Ryder's character not to ""drop anchor"" there. And while some reviewers have remarked that Ryder's character seemed self-indulgent, spoiled, and simply struggling with non-conformity, Ryder's character articulated the grim reality of her own mental illness when she painfully admitted to Jared Leto's character that she tried to kill herself by taking a bottle of aspirin; which was a complete departure from the character's denial when she was first admitted to the institution. When confronted with the opportunity to be free, Susanna was also confronted with a choice to be honest or stay stuck in denial. <br/><br/>My favorite scene was the scene where Susanna and her parents were having a conference with the doctor played by Jeffrey Tambor, and Susanna's mother couldn't stop crying, while Susanna's father was loudly demanding to know how long his daughter would be in ""this place?"" Then Susanna asked if her disease was genetic, and both parents halted their self-absorbed behaviors for 1 second to hear the answer before resuming their own brand of insanity. This scene told the viewer everything they needed to know about why Susanna felt depressed. Who would have anything to look forward to at 18 years of age when they had already realized how pretentious the adult world is? And what a kid has to become in order to ""fit in?"" <br/><br/>Oh yes, these girls were trying to tell us something, and here it is: children like to pretend, and as children grow up they're told by adults to stop pretending and face reality. So whose reality are they supposed to be facing, when they see that all the adults they should be able to trust are pretending? or plain lying? That realization could cause a girl (or a boy) to be interrupted in the transition from child to adult. Thus, the title and the ensuing madness.<br/><br/>Jolie can emote, that's for certain. Ryder can look fragile without effort because she has the physicality for it. That said, she's a talented actress and I miss watching her. Murphy was awesome, bless her little soul. Would've liked to have seen more of Redgrave, but then, Redgrave is so much more interesting than the others, so her screen presence had to be limited. Goldberg played Goldberg. And that's not to diminish the energy that is called Whoopi. No matter the role, Whoopi Goldberg comes across as down to earth, honest, no pretext.<br/><br/>A good film if you want to feel understood."

","I have read the good reviews and the bad reviews. So far all the bad reviews reveal that people really don't understand anything about MI (Mental Illness). <br/><br/>I think this movie is very successful in bringing out the reality of how difficult it is to live with a condition that so very few people understand. Just like the reviews the movie got, people who are different are being judged by these pretentious people who think they're better than everybody else.<br/><br/>I have had my share of time in a similar place but in a smaller hospital. I have made friends there and I know what it's like to be going out and missing them but of course, who wants to stay in there? I know depression when I see it and I can smell it 500 miles away. This movie brought me to tears because the emotions are spot on. I feel like they've read my journal. Well of course, they've read Sussana's and she produced it. I don't have BPD, I have a different diagnosis but I can relate to this very well.<br/><br/>Apparently, one person's attempt to make people understand what this is has not worked despite the great acting and the realism of it all. People are just blind I guess. Or perhaps it's true that unless you've experienced it, you will never understand. So try to walk even just a day in those shoes, then tell us what you think.<br/><br/>The only thing that I'm not completely satisfied with is the ending. I mean, I know the title is Girl, Interrupted but it feels like they interrupted the ending as well. They didn't quite give any answers really and it's a little frustrating cause I expected it to give a little more light than just focusing on memoirs."

","Though this film isn't for everyone, a combination of strong acting and elements of realism make it interesting at the very least. Though Girl, Interrupted isn't necesserily a ""new"" film, it is one I have only watched for the first time recently. Overall, I was pleased with what I saw though my feelings are mixed.<br/><br/>As far as positive aspects are concerned; the acting is top notch and this is unsurprising judging from the actors involved. Both Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie present powerful performances with strong supporting actors ensuring the film never flakes in the acting department. As well as the acting, the atmosphere the film creates is successful in being unsettling and even disturbing at times. Often I found myself feeling I was watching more of a horror film which isn't a bad thing as a majority of the subject matter is dealt with realistically and with an intense approach.<br/><br/>There is very little wrong with this film for what it is however what doesn't feel right unfortunately has a major impact on what I thought of the film as a whole. It feels good, like it should be a film I praise and give artistic applause however I had one major problem - the pacing. Pacing seems to give a film balance nowadays, making slow points in a story feel deep and necessary and, though none of the movie was particularly UNnecessary, it felt slow and I relied on the end for what the film should be - interesting and absorbing.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't think the film would be what it is without all the build up - it's just that there's so much of it. I thankfully expected this after I was informed that it's based on a book and real events though this film appealed to my artist-film-maker side as opposed to my film-fan side. Overall, I would recommend this movie if you like psychological, character-driven films or feel like a thought-provoking feminist piece of cinema.<br/><br/>6/10"

Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen a young high school graduate, falling into depression and downing a bottle of aspirin and chases it with vodka. That lands her a year stay at a mental institution, where she meets her new best friend Lisa(Angelina Jolie). Susanna gets diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, although there is nothing really wrong with her. She spends so much time with her new friends, she makes believe she is really crazy. Sneaking out at nights with the other girls and befriending Lisa, puts her in a different state of mind. She starts to treat doctors like the crazies did and disrespecting the head nurse (Whoopi Goldberg).Lisa received shock therapy for the last time and convinces Susanna to escape with her, to be Princesses in Disney Land. They go to Daisy's house (Brittany Murphy)a recently released patient, to stay until they can make some money. The night they got there Lisa rattles Daisy's cage. Susanna and Lisa wake up to find Daisy hung herself. Susanna reports this to authorities right away while Lisa flees the scene. Susanna returns to the facility she escaped from alone, and actually started getting better after she cut off ties with Lisa. Her stay at the mental institution changed her views on life and she made life long friends that helped educate her about peoples differences. I believe she became a more aware, more understanding person of a not so understanding situation. This movie brings out all emotions from anger to complete happiness , confusion and delusion, and laughing and crying. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes great actresses playing crazy people !"

They even play bowling.<br/><br/>The phrase, when the main character and Jared Leto lie in bed, ""all at some point in thinking about suicide"" suggests that it is.

"joethfc","6","1","1","10 May 2012"," I was largely 'ambivalent' (get it?)
","I'm glad that films are being made about such subject matter because I find them interesting in general. In this film we have the potential for a very good film indeed. The acting is very good and there is strength in depth right down to Jeffrey Tambor (for 'Arrested Development' fans) and Vanessa Redgrave (who seems under-used). Jolie steals the show with her amazing portrayal of a sufferer of manic depression/bipolar (I think). Winona Ryder is also great and I think she's generally underrated.<br/><br/>I didn't really like the films direction in general. It was all about hi jinx and rebellion for most of the film, which is a bit of a Hollywood cliché. Maybe they wouldn't hit enough of a market if it was more focused on mental health and criticisms of the system which might still be levelled in this day and age. The hidden room, sneaking around and escaping were more tiresome elements. The film failed to be psychological in spite of all of the acting talent at the top of their games. I may need to read the book because it sounds like it's responsible for the good elements in the film.<br/><br/>Another thing for me was the cat. The cat was absolutely lovely and a good actor, but I couldn't help feel it was another of Hollywood's cheap tricks to seduce animal lovers like myself. I thought the cat had too much screen time I was a bit worried whether the cat was going to meet a sticky end (a la midnight express) but it was too much of a straight Hollywood film to get that dark (not that I wanted them to).<br/><br/>The final point is about the film's resistance to talk about mental illness (again, in spite of great acting performances). Ryder's character never really seems to get to the bottom of anything (on the screen anyway), she mentions BPD (which is said to be over-diagnosed in women) and I'm very concerned by the overused of the term disorder rather than symptom. Do we ever establish whether she was/is depressed at any point? The film also seems to carry a sixties attitude to people being 'crazy' or 'sane', that seemed to be tied to good/evil at some point. I don't really know if there were any useful messages about mental health in this film. There was such a lack of detail in the phase detailing her recovery was so rushed and seemed to deliberately avoid any real breakthroughs.<br/><br/>My summary. Great Acting + Poor Screenplay + Cute Cat = Okay Film."

","""Was I ever crazy? Maybe. Or maybe life is.""<br/><br/>Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name, Girl, Interrupted is about a young woman in the 60's named Susanna (Winona Ryder) who is encouraged by her parents to enter a mental institution for a short time after she attempts to commit suicide. As the short stay ends up turning into a much longer one, Susanna has to make an actual attempt to deal with her issues, or risk becoming like the near-permanent residents of mental hospital she a patient in.<br/><br/>Most of this non-linear movie revolves around Susanna's relationships with the women she meets during her stay, including the volatile and sociopathic Lisa (Angelina Jolie), anti-social Daisy (Brittany Murphy), with her odd fixations, and child-like Polly (Elisabeth Moss). I don't know how accurate each woman's behaviors were to their actual conditions, but it was interesting seeing that what Susanna says at one point during the movie was actually true; that the people in the hospital really did and wanted the same things that we all do, only to an extreme.<br/><br/>I hope I'm not making Girl, Interrupted sound like some documentary on mental health, because that's not what it is at all. It's about one young woman and how her stay in this place with these women changed her and how she handled her own life. I thought it was pretty good. It portrays its subject matter frankly but respectfully, and the story doesn't drown in melodrama or sentimentality, as this kind of movie easily could have. Ryder, Jolie, and the rest of the cast were all great, and my attention was held from beginning to end. Recommended."
"serghei_romanu","8","1","1","7 January 2010"," Outstanding drama
","I consider it to be, one of the most educative, intelligent dramas ever created.<br/><br/>The film, presents the story of the main character Susanna Kaysen, interpreted by Winnona Ryder, who spent 18 months at a mental hospital in the 1960's. She mets here a couple of very disturbed young woman, including Lisa Rowe, wonderful played by Angelina Jolie, the wildest woman out there.<br/><br/>Step by step, she starts to feel part of the group and her interaction with these women, especially with Lisa, changes her perspective on what is really important in life. You may say, it's similar to ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"", and you may be right, still, it is a life lesson, everyone should watch it, at least once, because the message is strong, and extremely relevant, especially nowadays: Live your life, feel lucky you're healthy, because the are people out there who would do anything to be in your position.<br/><br/>Maybe to realize that you need a push.It's the case of Susannam who didn't realize how luck she is, until she saw the sufferance and misery of others.<br/><br/>If I could characterize this title in 4 words, I'd say it's: A wake up call, for everyone in delusion and denial.<br/><br/>I liked it a lot, because it focused on the group, and brought up a realistic image of the life in a psychiatric institution. I rate ""Girl Interrupted"" a **** out of *****"
"zardoz-13","8","1","1","10 April 2008"," Hanging With A Neurotic
","""Girl Interrupted,"" starring Winona Ryder and Golden Globe winner Angelina Jolie, is ""The Snake Pit"" with snakes.<br/><br/>If you've never seen ""The Snake Pit,"" Olivia de Havilland of ""Gone with the Wind"" fame played a young housewife that suffered a nervous breakdown and wound up in a notorious mental institution. Nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in 1948, this grim, unrelenting expose chronicled one woman's descent into insanity and her struggle to recover. Until Jack Nicholson came along in 1975 with Milos Foreman's ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" all insane asylum movies were measured against ""The Snake Pit."" Of course, there had been other interesting asylum movies, such as two that appeared in 1955: Jose Ferrer's ""The Shrike"" (1955) and Vincente Minnelli's ""The Cobweb."" In ""Girl Interrupted,"" Winona Ryder of ""Heathers"" fame plays a neurotic high school graduate diagnosed with ""borderline personality disorder."" Meaning, she experiences confusion about her identity, her long-term goals, her friends, and her moral values. After she makes a half-hearted attempt to kill herself by chasing a bottle of aspirin with Vodka, her physician advises that she commit herself. Susan Kaysen's bestselling memoir serves as the factual basis of ""Girl Interrupted."" Naturally, ""Copland"" director James Mangold stretches the truth, but he doesn't stretch it so much that you would notice the discrepancy.<br/><br/>This lightweight but absorbing melodrama boasts a terrific ensemble cast with Oscar caliber performances, especially from future ""Laura Croft"" star Angelina Jolie, but it is a far cry from either ""The Snake Pit"" or ""The Cuckoo's Nest."" ""Girl Interrupted"" dramatizes Kaysen's two year stint at Claymoore, the fictional counterpart to a real life private psychiatric clinic near Boston, Massachusetts. Sure, Susan (Winona Ryder) survives the ordeal and emerges none the worst for wear. Such is not the case for her unfortunate fellow inmates. When our protagonist arrives at Claymoore, Lisa (Angelina Jolie), the prototypical bad girl patient with keen insight into everybody's problems, takes her under wing and shows her the ropes. Predictably, Lisa emerges as a horrid influence. Eventually, Susan realizes that she must quit trying to buck the system and come to grips with reality.<br/><br/>Although it shuns the usual mental ward movie stereotypes, ""Girl Interrupted"" never lingers long on anything unpleasant; after all, this is a chick flick for teens and twentysomethings. Occasionally, somebody finds herself strapped up in a straitjacket, but frequently they frolic without fear, after the nightly bed checks, raid the patient files to catch up on what the therapists are writing about them, or escape on harmless excursions.<br/><br/>Okay, one girl commits suicide by hanging herself, but the worst thing that happens to Winona's character is that helpful Whoopi Goldberg pushes her into a tub of cold water and reprimands her. Despite all the rules, attendants, and stern but sympathetic nurses, our heroines come and go as they please with moderate supervision. ""Girl Interrupted"" resembles a cross-between of TV's vintage sitcom ""Hogan's Heroes"" and ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" in a sorority setting.<br/><br/>Ultimately, strong performances, a persuasive cast, and a mild sedative of a saga make ""Girl Interrupted"" worth watching once if not twice."
"dead47548","9","1","1","4 February 2008"," Ryder shines.
","An outrageously flawless performance from the lovely Winona Ryder highlights this interesting, though sometimes tedious film. Some if it felt really out of place but for the most part it was a compelling story. Not entirely unique and with a load of cliché characters and scenes, it still found ways to keep drawing me in and focusing on the plot. As I said before, Ryder is phenomenal in one of my favorite female performances of the decade and is surely my win for the year. Her range and emotional intensity is flawless. I found that her character was extremely easy for me to relate to and that made her performance that much more emotional for me. Jolie was also great and deserved her win, though I give it to Bonham Carter."
"blanche-2","9","1","1","29 January 2008"," Girl, institutionalized
","Winona Ryder is a ""Girl, Interrupted"" in this 1999 film also starring Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Jeffrey Tambor, Vanessa Redgrave and Clea Duvall. Ryder is Susanna, a high school graduate from a good family who attempts suicide and is then institutionalized. The script, in fact, is based on Susanna Kaysen's real-life account of her time in a mental institution in the '60s. In denial about her condition, she observes the ""crazies"" around her, finally becoming friends with an 8-year resident, Lisa (Angelia Jolie) whose biting insights and bucking of authority keep the place lively and keep Susanna going. As Susanna recovers and comes face to face with a devastating tragedy, she realizes that Lisa's type of resistance is not the way to go and that she must involve herself in the therapeutic process so that she can go home.<br/><br/>This is a very dramatic and emotional story that I admit right up front left me sobbing. Though dark and often sad, it is a very life-affirming movie. The acting is beyond superb. Jolie, in her Oscar-winning performance, has the tour de force role, and she's magnificent. Jolie is one of those people whose once bizarre personality traits and now humanitarian efforts and relationship with Brad Pitt occasionally obliterate the fact that she's a fabulous and versatile actress. Ryder is stunning as the confused and depressed Susanna. Unfortunately, one of her first lines in the film is, ""Did you ever steal something when you had the cash?"" - if people did a riff on that when she was arrested for shoplifting, I missed it. She's another one whose personal peccadilloes have overshadowed some wonderful acting. These two women are surrounded by a marvelous cast of pros, including Redgrave as a patient psychiatrist, Goldberg as a tough but kind RN on the ward and Brittany Murphy as a deeply disturbed young woman. All of the women who play patients are excellent and will tear at your heart.<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" is a brilliant film and probably an underrated one. It's possible that people who hadn't seen it when Jolie won the Oscar were put off by her strange appearance at the Oscars as well as the interviews she gave about being in love with her brother, rough sex, and her use of sharp instruments. Then Ryder had her day. I truly hope none of that kept people from renting this movie, because it - and they - are beautiful."
"deanofrpps","8","1","1","7 January 2007"," a haunting movie
","It would be hard to say this is a story of a descent into hades like say SNAKE PIT or some of the mental hospital films of the 1940s or 50s. Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is not really insane nor is she truly suicidal. In reality she is just a little morose.<br/><br/>Her unwillingness to go to college suggests to her upper middle class parents a serious psychological disorder. Since she comes from an upper middle class status conscious family which finds her late adolescent problems upsetting, the rule is where there's money there's treatment and a convenient label. In Susanna Kaysen's case the label becomes BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER.<br/><br/>The hospital is a farce. It's borderline between being a holding pen for well connected young woman and a joy camp. The Doctor supposedly treating her sleeps during psycho-theraphy. There's kindly Val the nurse who's more of a Super-Mom babysitter for wealthy girls. Meanwhile at night the girls can have the run of the facility as soon as they drug up the night nurse and send her off to sleep. Notwithstanding locks and bars, little toughie Lisa Rowe can escape whenever she wants.<br/><br/>Val is the first to tell Susanna to grow up.<br/><br/>The characters on the ward are interesting: little toughie Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) who bullies the other patients around, wishy-washy Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) whose insecurities toughie Lisa knows how to probe; Polly 'Torch' Clark (Elisabeth Moss) and assorted others who just don't want to grow up.<br/><br/>Susanna Kaysen keeps a diary in which she's keeping book on her co-inmates. Can she survive to tell the tale or will the hospital destroy her.<br/><br/>The film is interesting for its period: 1968. The girls are seen huddled around the TV listening to Chet Huntley announcing the grim news of the assassination of Dr Martin L King. Yet there are slight historical lapses: the draft lottery that caught Sussana's boyfriend wasn't started until 1970 or 1971 when Nixon was President. In 1968 LBJ still President that year was still playing catch as catch can with men eligible for the draft.<br/><br/>Yet the film did catch some of the flavor of the 1960s, girls hair styles and clothes excepting Sussana's date from that period. Winona Ryder did exude that occasionally less than subtle upper-middle class racism when addressing Val the nurse.<br/><br/>There is a poignant scene where Susanna meets up with life having passed her by while she was on ice in the looney bin. On a walkabout with the ward and nurse Val off grounds, Susanna meets a high school friend who went to Sara Lawrence University and then on to The Sorbonne."

"lee_eisenberg","8","1","1","14 April 2006"," more than another person's story
","I had never heard of Susanna Kaysen when ""Girl, Interrupted"" came out, but this movie based on her memoirs was really something. It tells the story of when she was put in a mental institution in the late '60s. Winona Ryder, whose roles sometimes seem either silly or overdone, does a very good job as Susanna, showing her as a strong-willed young woman who just couldn't seem to express herself right. Believe it or not, Angelina Jolie - looking more haggard than usual - also does a really good job in the movie. She plays Lisa Rowe, whom Susanna befriends in the institution. Lisa can gravitate between affectionate and acerbic, and is truly the bane of the establishment.<br/><br/>Maybe this movie on one level does show how events affected another person, but it really is more than that. It shows how the Vietnam War is affecting everyone, as Susanna's boyfriend Toby Jacobs (Jared Leto) might get sent to Vietnam. All in all, this is one of the many movies that my generation can remember fondly, just as my parents' generation fondly remembers ""The Graduate"". Also starring Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy, Jeffrey Tambor, Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave."
"amyhpete","9","1","1","15 September 2005"," Girl, Interrupted was excellent
","This was a well-acted drama. It escaped the trap of becoming too melodramatic and causing the audience to feel uncomfortable by the ""acting out"" of emotions. The playfulness and the way the young women bond with one another is also excellent - the human spirit will prevail in any circumstances.<br/><br/>I thought Brittany Murphy was the ""sleeper"" hit of the movie - her portrayal of a girl troubled by her incestuous relationship with her father and other elements of her terrible homelife while putting on a snobbish facade was amazing.<br/><br/>I also became a fan of Clea DuVall (Georgina) through this movie. She portrayed a great balance of tough and vulnerable as well.<br/><br/>It was haunting and heartbreaking, lovely, and disconcertingly familiar."
"forgot_dot","8","1","1","11 July 2005"," A realistic drama
","Girl Interrupted is not another drama about interpersonal issues. It is a drama about intrapersonal issues. The main character Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) interacts with a perfectly portrayed cast while she experiences an inner journey that is catalysed through her interactions and observations of others. The naturalism of the film in terms of acting and cinematography allows the audience to be be drawn into Susanna's world. From looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD it is also clear that the director has worked hard to maintain the focus of the film and this is very clear when you watch the movie, there is hardly a moment where Winona is not on screen and this is very much deliberate. <br/><br/>The enormous strengths of the film do however serve to contrast some of it's weaknesses. The cinematography, while exceedingly natural and smooth, is also quite utilitarian, having been subordinated to the purpose of plot development. The greatest flaw however is the predictability of the scripting and supporting characters. While the main character Susanna tends to defy any label other than 'human person' the other supporting characters tend to fall under far more genre-specific stereotypes. The excellent acting on the part of everyone in this film helps to overcome this weakness however. In terms of scripting the predictable elements are not so obvious as to prevent the film's dialogue to be both funny and truthful. <br/><br/>For a film based on a true story (a book) Girl Interrupted manages to be gimmick-free much to its credit. The acting and directing is so smooth that even the frequent use of flashbacks seem entirely natural.<br/><br/>A brilliant execution 4 out of 5 stars."

","**** out of **** <br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" is the true story of a girl from the 1960's called Susanna Kaysen, who in the movie is played by Winona Ryder. She tries to kill herself by taking a full bottle of aspirin with a full bottle of vodka. That's my only regret for the movie, nothing more. Susanna goes to a mental institution, Claymoore, only for doing that, and although that's not, by any means, an ""only"", later in the movie, we discover that Susanna has nothing particularly wrong with herself, at least, she doesn't show that a lot. The only thing that she actually needs to do is to understand her problem, which in the movie is called ""Borderline Disorder Personality"". So, she meets the rest of the people from the mental institution, including Angelina Jolie, who plays Lisa Rowe.<br/><br/>Jolie is terrific. Couldn't have been better. She really deserved an Oscar for best actress in a supporting role and she also contributes a lot to one of the greatest qualities of the movie: the performances. There are also other girls with mental problems, including a girl who lies, another one who, by the age of 10, burned herself in the face and many others. All of them in the women ward, where also later we meet Vanessa Redgrave and Whoopi Goldberg. The soundtrack is also great too, as it sometimes feels sad, sometimes happy and sometimes even childish, but at the same time, alternatively interesting, adding a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. And finally, Kurtwood Smith makes a quick, but nice appearance at the beginning of the movie, as Dr. Crumble. The rest of the cast includes: Clea Duvall, Angella Bettis, Elizabeth Moss and even Brittany Murphy, who plays one of the most problematic girls of the story.<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" is a great drama movie and by this time, I've already watched it twice and not only I'm interested in watching it again, I want to watch the other Winona Ryder movies because I think her career is simply one of the best."

This movie gave you a true sense of what some people actually go through in their lives. Like you never know whats going on in a crazy person's mind or how their thinking, and this movie lets you in on that, which is really cool.<br/><br/>Also it was interesting to watch how Susanna got munipulated into believing that she was actually crazy and thus then trying to cure herself. And how Lisa was saying that when you confess your secrets your free or whatever and Susanna was asking what if you have no secret to confess and Lisa responds with ""then your a lifer like me"", that whole thing was really interesting in the way that even though Susanna thought she had nothing to confess, she just shared whatever was in her head as she had theorpy. That kinda got to me, cuz when you think about it, it's true, our thoughts in our head that we think about daily are our secrets cuz we dont share them we just think about them. So thus everyone has secrets that will make us free if we just get them out of us.<br/><br/>There is so much that I got out of this movie, but I won't bore you with it don't worry, and to all those people who thought it sucked or boring, watch it again and see what they're actually saying, or how it might relate to you.

Whoopi Goldberg does what she can with her small role as a nurse. If you are looking for a reason to see ""Girl, Interrupted"", Ms. Jolie steals the film with her heart-wrenching role as Lisa."

","It's great to see Winona Ryder in a starring role....it had been a while since I saw her playing the lead in a movie.  I really enjoyed this movie....it was slow at times, but still entertaining.  This movie is basically a showcase of two of the most interesting young actresses around: Winona, and Angelina she-looks-like-her-father Jolie.  Angelina is, without question, astonishing in this performance. She IS the best supporting actress of 1999.  The roles of the two girls are polar opposites.  Angelina has a flashy, flamboyant, in-your-face role.  It's a very dramatic role, yet it's not overdone at all--that's what makes her performance so remarkable. On the other hand, Winona's role is understated, but it's also a great performance.  Her performance is subtle, yet it's powerful.  Her facial expressions alone are mesmerizing.  I couldn't take my eyes off of her, with her delicate, porcelain doll looks.  I couldn't help but feel captivated by the range of emotions on her face.  I think that both she and Angelina were perfect for their roles.  Their wonderful performances make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable movies of the year."

Each of the main characters grabbed me. Lisa was by far my favorite and entrapped me. What she did to Daisy was heart breaking however and broke some of my love for the character. In any case I enjoyed the film a great deal and I intend to see it many more times."

","Basically Angelina Jolie is the cool sociopath.  She has a lot of hurt inside of her and stuff and instead of dealing with it, she turns the women in Claymore's mental ward into a cool clique of girls.  The film portrays Winona Ryder's character sympathetically. She is borderline, thus she has casual sex and is depressed.  Everyone is trying to commit suicide in the film, and there are some scenes that are hard to watch. What is brilliant about the film is how it shows a mental asylum from the point of view of the patients.  Winona Ryder's eyes see the place as a College or University for the messed up.  But towards the end, she realizes she has problems and deals with them.  There are many good performances, even Whoopi is good.  This film should pick up some Oscar nominations, but no wins."

","Girl Interrupted was a very well made film that cast a harsh light on what the 60s were to some people. Although standard in its idea, the cinematography was very slick, with some brilliant cuts from flashback to real time. Winona Ryder was very good in the lead role, showcasing her versatility and considerable talent amidst a solid but unspectacular supporting cast. Jolie was good, but I don't think quite worthy of a Golden Globe. She only established her claim to the award in the last quarter of the film, which to me is not quite good enough. However, since Hollywood award voters give high kudos to any film with the words ""Based on a true story"" behind the title it is easy to see how she could win. Still, her performance as the maverick presence in the institution was good. All in all, a film worth going to see, and one which hopefully pushes Winona Ryder further up the Hollywood ladder. 7 out of 10."

I admire her not only for her wonderful acting, but for stepping back to play the role of Susanna rather than Lisa, because the role of Lisa seems to be a more appealing role for an actress.  Lisa is the focus, while the story is depicted from Susanna's point of view.  Winona has redeemed herself in my eyes with incredible work:  her acting, her taking the role of Susanna, for finally making a mostly-female casted movie, and for making it a must see.

","Borderline Personality Disorder is an often used and abused psychiatric term given to young women(and sometimes young men)when their problems can't be clearly pinpointed by the usual battery of more specifically categorized disorders.  Popular in the '70's and '80's, a surprising number of individuals were labeled this way.<br/><br/>What this film so graphically portrays, though, is that it is actually a ""hole"" that one falls into when adolescence, intelligence, and the real world (so different from the childhood one that can be influenced by imagination) intersect. Climbing out of that hole is the challenge, particularly because holes are dark and one can't see the obstacles that one has placed in the hole that can hinder the process. Sheer will, determination, and learning to trust others is often the light that can illuminate that darkness. <br/><br/>Suzanna Kaysen says near the end of the film that she has wasted a year of her life, but in reality her life has become richer and deeper from spending that year in the way that she did.  Often when one is at the surface of the hole, one feels stupid for not having seen what was there, but when pain is deep the walls used to protect one from it can be high and wide.<br/><br/>While Angelina Jolie's performance is astonishing and powerful, the main reason to see this film is not to see why she took home the Golden Globe. It is the fact that what you are looking at on the screen is world that no longer exists.  In the modern world of money grubbing HMOs, the journey to the rim of hole is hampered by the prohibited cost of health care and unwillingness of insurance companies to pay for it.  Today Suzanna would be mired in her hole and not on her way to being a well known writer.<br/><br/>
That complaint aside, Suzanna's story teaches us that the holes that we all dig for ourselves are escapable and as the old children's rhyme states ""can't go over it, can't go under it, can't go around it, gotta go through it.""  Otherwise, we will never reach the top.<br/><br/>There are certainly a number of differences here from the original book and that is to be expected as the flow of the story was not exactly harmonious with a transfer to film.  However, the spirit of the book is still here, and that is the important thing."

As one of my favorite actresses, Angelina Jolie did such an incredible job, perhaps even better than her performance in ""Gia"" which is also a touching story. Winona Ryder really surprised me with her performance, maybe my lack of faith in her acting skills was simply because she had never been given a character to play which had more than a one dimension personality. The supporting roles are also good. The direction, set design, costumes, music, etc also live up to and exceed all of my expectations.

I don't know if it was that catchy Sixpence None the Richer cover or my obsession with Angelina Jolie's stunning lips.  It just looked like a movie worth paying $ 8.00 for, for it seemed very high-profile and Winona Ryder seemed to be inspired enough by the Susanna Kaysen memoir to get it greenlighted. The early reviews I read on the Rotten Tomatoes site didn't seem too enthusiastic.  I knew they had to be wrong. The 30-seccond spots on TV with Angelina screaming "" I'll jam this in my aorta! "" seemed way too appealing for me not to like.  So I saw the movie last week, and I began to realize that Roger Ebert isn't always right. I absolutely loved the movie.  Though it was psychotically long, it remained interesting throughout. Winona Ryder perfectly reflects the emotions of her character, for she should win an Oscar just for Best Facial Expressions. Angelina Jolie is given a juicier role, and she's deliciously psycho in this movie and always keeps the audience on their toes. I'm glad Clea DuVall isn't in the Interchangable Kevin Williamson Teen Thriller club anymore and she is also good in this movie.  Brittany Murphy was also good, but her role in this movie and the way they play out her scenes seemed a little awkward.  I don't care what critics say, thinking their so intelligent when they emphasize how this movie is ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO's NEST meets THE BABYSITTER'S CLUB. So what, I love movies like this."

","I've read several opinions (here and in magazines) that the movie stuck quite closely to the book, and I'm wondering if I read the same book.  The movie seemed only to take shreds of the book, and add a lot of wild and outrageous adventures that seem to be attempting to make mental illness look like fun....which is odd, because it is not.  I was disappointed to see that the film offers the idea that Susanna is merely spoiled and self-indulgent and not actually mentally disturbed.  Had the film included some sections of the book (like when she claws through the skin on her hand because she's convinced that she has no bones), that theory would have been impossible. The staging and camerawork seemed bland and formulaic, as did the script, providing a fairly sugar coated view of mental illness, until the scene in the basement of the hospital, towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie's performance, at first, seemed to fit the wild, free and easy depiction of mental illness, but in the last half of the movie, she began to make her character increasingly cruel, reminding the audience that she IS a sociopath, and not just a ""free spirit, unjustly imprisoned"".  I got the impression that Winona Ryder could have acted this part in her sleep, and did so, until the bathtub scene with Whoopi Goldberg, where she seemed to break out of the naive waif characterization, and finally show some signs of life.  The supporting actresses did well, as did Jeffrey Tambor in a role that is far from his usual comedy. Overall, this film can't be seen as a serious study of mental illness until close to the end, when things get intense, and you realize that these girls really are ill.  I do feel that if the movie had stuck more closely to the book, it may not have been as fun, but it certainly would have been more realistic."

All the characters are the same types we've seen in other movies like this in the past (The Bell Jar, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden). The plot makes escaping the ward laughably easy and makes a mental ward look kind of fun (and boring). All the characters talk in clichés and by the last hour of the movie I was ahead of the plot constantly. It gets dull when you know exactly what's going to happen. The acting is no help--Ryder used to be good. What's happened to her? She has basically one expression that she uses the whole movie. Whoppi Goldberg is VERY toned down and miserable (at least she looks it). Redgrave barely makes an impression as the head of the hospital. Only Jolie shows any spark of life. She's enjoying every second of her role and it shows. Unfortunately, she can't carry the whole movie. So it's OK but predictable. Worth a video rental (maybe). Great soundtrack though."

Angelina Jolie, as she was in another mediocre movie (The Bone Collector) is the films only real actress with potential, and she is the only interesting non-forced character.

"MickeyTo","Null","1","1","21 January 2000"," I Wanna Be A 'Girl Interupted!'
","Using the turbulent sixties as a backdrop, and relying on the typical negative commentary about psychiatry, Girl Interupted is the story of one social misfit who, denied any say in the matter, commits herself into a mental hospital. <br/><br/>Winona Ryder is Susanna, a sullen teenager fresh out of high school, who is battling depression and 'who knows what else'  She has had an affair with a married man and she recently swallowed a bottle of pills, chasing them down with a bottle of vodka.  She claimed she had a head ache.<br/><br/>Once inside, she is subject to the wisdom of Whoopi Goldberg, and befriended by one rough house patient named Lisa (played by Angelina Joli).  Of course everyone goes on a bit of a journey into self discovery, and we learn that crazy people really aren't so bad.  <br/><br/>I had some serious problems with this movie, yet at the same time, I kind of liked it.  There is a story here, and it does move well.  Winona Ryder is actually very good in this role, and in fact this probably ranks up there as one of her best.  Angelina Joli, meanwhile, steals the show as an 'out of control' freak with a heart of gold.  Count this one as a milestone moment in a budding career.<br/><br/>On the other hand, as a whole, this movie does not offer us anything new, and despite the bad language, this subject could have been handled just as well as a movie of the week.  I have heard comparisons to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but such a  classic cannot be touched by a film filled with a bunch of little tarts running around in their night gowns behaving like children.<br/><br/>My biggest concern about Girl Interupted was not what it presented, but what it failed to present.  The girls here seem to have it made.  There is no real damage done to a bunch of sex starved chicks who hide their pills and then take them later on for the sake of getting high.  Girl Interupted presents a promising picture of patients of psychiatry, suggesting that a short visit will have you cured in no time and failing to mention that the stigma attached to these places, then and now, can be somewhat limiting indeed."

"chicklet-2","8","1","1","19 January 2000"," Lisa of course
","This movie is in most aspects unremarkable.  I enjoyed it thoroughly; however, it was a pale reflection of the superb film adaptation of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  The script was not true enough to Kaysen's novel. Why, then you might ask, should you part with $7.50 to see this film?  I can afford you only one reason, but it's a damn good one.  Her name is Angelina Jolie, and her performance crackles with the energy of Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  You cannot help but be taken in by her.  She sets the screen ablaze with her brash honesty, quick wit, and total and complete lack of conscience.  She is what you have always wanted to be but were to afraid to admit it, or so you think.  Until you realize along with the main character that she lacks any moral consideration of others there is only her in her world and what she needs because to her others do not matter.  She fears nothing, and so she cares about nothing which gives her license to do whatever she pleases, no consequences.  She's the very definition of dangerous.  This is never explained in the movie, but Jolie gets it across. She's incredible.  Give her the golden globe and the oscar. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, the real tragedy of this film is Winona Ryder.  She does a beautiful and poignant job of illustrating the conflicts within her character, but for all of her beauty, talent, and poise she cannot stand up to Jolie who dominates every scene in which she appears... and when she exits the scene for some time toward the end of the film she leaves the audience asking the same question as Susanna over and over, ""Where's Lisa?"""

"Joe Moretti","Null","1","1","17 January 2000"," Been There, Seen That, Done It ""Girl"" Has Its Moments
","Sitting through the new film, ""Girl, Interrupted"" one feels like you have been down this road before and mostly likely you have.  Hollywood has given the screen treatment to mental illness and the institutions that house those afflicted before, from 1948's harrowing, superb ""The Snake Pit"" to everyone's favorite 1975's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"".  In fact ""Girl, Interrupted"" seems somewhat like a female version of that 1975 film.  That said, ""Girl"" is not a bad film, it has some very good moments, it's just not that fresh and is filled with the typical stock characters that populate this genre, though it does boast a couple of good performances, especially Winona Ryder as the lead character.<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" is adapted from the1993 memoir of writer Susanna Kaysen's emotional breakdown as a teenager in the late 60's.  The film follows Susanna (the wonderful Winona Ryder) right after her suicide attempt, which lands her into a mental institution for women.  There she comes into contact with the regulars on the floor and ends up forming a bond with the seriously unstable and controlling Lisa (Angelina Jolie), who has already been a resident for eight years.  What happens throughout the film is the basic standard fare for this film genre.  Getting to know the patients and their eccentricities, patients versus staff, nightly escapades, breakouts, it has all been down before.  The film rises above itself when it focuses outside of the institution and the group residents; that is when the film becomes compelling.  Such scenes as Susanna slipping in and out of different parts of her life or her one on one sessions with various doctors lift the film from it's retread material and attempts to go beyond the typical fare.<br/><br/>The saving grace of ""Girl, Interrupted"" which makes it worth seeing is the superb performance by Winona Ryder, giving one of her best performances in years.  Her subtle, focused and moving performance helps to ground the film into reality.  This is a young girl caught between the two worlds of normalcy and off-kilter and Ryder conveys this perfectly without going over the top.  Such though cannot be said about Angelina Jolie's performance of Lisa, the charismatic sociopath.  It can be seen why Jolie would be attracted to such a flashy, explosive character, but unfortunately she goes too far over the top and her theatrics drive the character completely off the map of believability, which ends up hurting the picture to a degree.  It is only towards the end when her performance is somewhat toned down, but by that time it is too late. The other actresses do okay in their standard stock roles, although Brittany Murphy is excellent as Daisy, a young emotionally disturbed girl with major problems.  Whoopie Goldberg does her best work in years as an intelligent and caring nurse and Vanessa Regrave is fine as the doctor of the institution.  In fact Goldberg and Regrave's scenes with Winona Ryder are some of the highlights of this film.<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" starts off on a great note, but then becomes standard and somewhat predictable, with a few shining moments throughout.  Some reworking of this film could have made it much more than above average. Regardless, Winona Ryder's performance makes this film worth seeing, just as Jude Law did with the over rated ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"".  A Marginal Recommendation. × × ×  out of 5"

I'm not exactly sure how structurely good it is since it starts near the end, goes to the beginning, has multiple flashbacks for the first half hour and then stops and continues with a chronological narrative. However, other then that small annoyance, the film is a poignant, funny, sad, and memorable piece of film making. Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie are exceptional. Another stand out performance is by Brittany Murphy who plays Daisy, she does a great job.

When I left the theatre, I felt rather depressed, which shows that the film had an effect on me.<br/><br/>Many critics have compared this film to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", while the only similarity in the two films is its setting. ""Girl"" takes a life of its own, and becomes a fascinating character study of a young woman trying to live life how she wants to live it. Winona Ryder gives one of her strongest performances as Susanna Kaysen, while Angelina Jolie is brilliant as the sociopath Lisa. Though Ryder and Jolie are the two central characters in the film (with the scene-chewing performances), there are several other supporting characters that we learn to sympathize with as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Though there isn't much Oscar buzz for this one (except for Jolie's performance), I think that Ryder should at least get an Oscar nomination for her daring, original performance.

You think you have problems? The young ladies at the elite institution have all sorts of mental maladies, some seemingly harmless and some bent on destruction. Is Susanna the only sane one? Even she isn't sure - she's the only one of her graduating high school class who didn't have collegiate plans, a fact that's drummed into her by each authority figure she comes into contact with. Finally, when Susanna chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka, her parents have her committed - for a 'rest.'<br/><br/>This film appears to pull no punches when it comes to dealing with insanity and the people directly affected by it. While none of the secondary characters is really fleshed out, it's clear the emphasis is on Susanna and how she relates to the madness surrounding her. It's a staggeringly difficult dilemma - are you insane, or are you just struggling like everyone else? There are similarities in this movie to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and even to the comedic ""The Dream Team,"" but what sets this apart from the others in this genre are the performances, particularly by Ryder. It's never easy to play someone who's handicapped, despite all appearances to the contrary, but what Ryder needed to do was convey a character who may or may not be a borderline personality, not a clear-cut case. This is a task the actress tackles with gusto. While others in the role might tend to overstate their character's plight or actions, Ryder takes the subtle approach, reining in her actions and reactions enough to allow the viewer to empathize fully with her.<br/><br/>The flip side of that approach is displayed by Jolie, who is so far over the top with her portrayal of Lisa that the viewer never gets a chance to root for her. In the face of tragedy and suffering, Lisa laughs sarcastically and generally makes people feel worse than ever. It's obvious from the start that this is a defense mechanism, but like Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining,"" because we never see Lisa in a favorable light - or, more importantly, in a sane one - we're never able to like her. There's hardly a likeable aspect to Lisa, who seems to become more destructive as the movie progresses (a statement on the healing power of our mental institutions? You be the judge). In other words, Jolie's character is so completely wacked out from the get-go that no one in the audience can really care about her much, only in how she affects Susanna. Only at the end of the movie do we get a glimpse of the depth of Jolie's character, but by then you might not care."

I think there were great performances done by all in this movie, but my favorite was Brittany Murphy's. She expressed so much emotion, that it just was bursting out of my TV and into the space surronding me and I could just feel every thing she was feeling.

","""Girl, Interrupted"" is a fairly interesting movie, since it tells the story about some girls who are at claymore. Claymore is a private mental hospital.

Lisa (The Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie) is a rebellious girl who thinks she's right on everything she does.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie played her character quite well; she really envelops herself into the role; however Cloe Sevigni should have won the academy award for best actress in a supporting role instead. She truly deserved it. Anyway Angelina was amazing in portraying this complicated girl. Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder carry out their roles splendidly. But I keep wondering why Winona Ryder didn't get any awards for her performance.<br/><br/>Suicide is an interesting topic for a movie, since it happens quite frequently everywhere.

"Adrian-32","7","1","1","15 January 2000"," Imperfect, but interesting
","""Girl, Interrupted"" does not cover a lot of new territory. You can call it a female version of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" as both films deal with the issue of mental insanity, and are shown from and insider's perspective of how it's really like, and the way society reacts towards people who are institutions. So, this is not a film that breaks new ground, but it is still an interesting one. Flawed, yes, mainly due to it's unfocused plot and lack of emphasis on some situations, but overall the film is worth watching. It's a candid look at the 60's, as people who did not know where they were going, or did not have a solid plan, would be deemed crazy. The protagonist, played well by Winona Ryder, is sort of like a lost adolescent who finds herself indifferent towards life, and ends up being locked up, only to realise that sometimes it's the world who causes people to lash out, not themselves. We are taken into her long journey inside a mental hospital, introducing us to a handful of ""loonies"" who are both heartbreaking and hilarious to watch. Angelina Jolie steals the show playing a wild sociopath who befriends Ryder during her stay, it's affecting to know that she was actually a real person. Brittany Murphy is also a standout, her character is profoundly tragic, I don't think she will get out her my head anytime soon. The story moves at a decent pace, and has many memorable moments, but for some reason, loses it's edge during the climax, resorting to melodrama in order to evoke emotions. But despite it's weaknesses, ""Girl, Interrupted"" is still a thoughtful study of a young woman's discovery of hope during a time of despair."
"Mike Astill","Null","1","1","9 August 2001"," Great performances in an unsatisfying melodrama
","Although I haven't read the book, it's clear director Mangold's attempt to adapt it is sincere. Unfortunately the movie lacks spirit, is overly sentimental and relies far too heavily on the late-sixties setting to deliver its highly personal message. If indeed there IS a message, as for the most part it seems nothing more than a collection of fragmented ramblings from the diary of the main character, writer Susanna Kaysen (Ryder). Commentary on the deleted scenes on the DVD version include Mangold's admission that scenes from the novel simply don't translate well to the screen, a point that perhaps can be made to many scenes that didn't wind up on the cutting-room floor also.<br/><br/>It's left to the principals to save the film, and fortunately they do so in good style. Jolie is mesmerising and catlike, shifting from a purr to a snarl in the blink of an eye. She's the perfect foil to Ryder's doe-eyed protagonist, and a great deal of enjoyment can be taken by simply seeing them together on screen. Jolie's destructive character Lisa threatens to drag down all those around her, in particular the vulnerable Kaysen. It's a career defining turn, easily deserving of the Oscar. Ryder is as accomplished as always, you just assume a great performance from her so she never appears to excel. <br/><br/>The movie looks and sounds beautiful, particularly in the early scenes when Kaysen's mind is wandering. It's a shame the style settles in to nothing more than an unsatisfying melodrama, and ends with an embarrassingly weak confrontation between the two leads."

","Based on a true story, Girl, Interrupted gives an account of Susanna Kaysen's 18 month stay at a mental hospital during the 1960's.<br/><br/>I'll kick off with a disclaimer that I have not read Susanna Kaysen's book, but I can only presume, and hope, that the book doesn't have nearly as many shortcomings as the film.<br/><br/>One major thing I did take exception to with this film is its lack of depth and development in terms of its characters. Angelina Jolie's character Lisa is a sociopath who is little more than a playground bully which truth be told is it a little one-note and becomes a bit tiresome after the novelty wears off. Jolie is quite good here and this film helped to showcase that she had some range, but I just wish that her character had been given more dimension and depth. In fairness, we do gain more of an understanding of her character at the end of the film, but this doesn't make up for the fact that Jolie had nothing to work with in the early stages of the film. The only other supporting character to get any sort of focus was Daisy (Brittany Murphy), but again her character isn't that well-written and her character, like Lisa, didn't really have enough depth to make me care.<br/><br/>Even when looking at the main character Susanna the writers probably don't develop her as well as they should have done; it seemed with Susanna, like Lisa, that all of the interesting things about her character are lazily thrown in at the end and prior to this we witness numerous therapy sessions, flashbacks, and Susanna ingratiating herself with the sisterhood at Claymoore and sadly I didn't find any of these things particularly insightful.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder put in good performances and some of the insights given at the end do give the film some weight, but I couldn't help but feel that the director's own indulgences got in the way far too often. Girl, Interrupted provides us with a lot of potentially interesting characters that sadly are never allowed to become interesting and a potentially interesting story that doesn't always focus its attention in the right areas. Inevitably, this film will probably be compared to One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but by comparison, Girl, Interrupted falls short."

","Girl Interrupted (1999): Dir: James Mangold / Cast: Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Clea DuVall: Misguided film about intrusion of the mind and those disturbances that hinder our daily functions. Winona Ryder is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and spends two years in an institution. She should have been diagnosed with worse than that for agreeing to be part of this exercise in shame. She has flashbacks to a past relationship and an affair with a married man. None of this is dealt with properly. This is actually about her friendship of sorts with an insane sociopath named Lisa. It displays an institution where patients seem to come and go as they please, which leads to a night of bowling. Director James Mangold gives insight but his Copland is a much better example of his work. The only performance that rings true in this formula crap fest is Angelina Jolie. She steals the film as Lisa, but Ryder never seems to be there. We never really buy into Ryder's release in its hokey happy finale. Whoopi Goldberg as a caregiver is a prop that seems like the umpteenth detail stolen from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Brittany Murphy and Clea DuVall are amongst those who play fellow patients. The theme is handled too lightly to take seriously in its disruption of the mind and the road to sanity. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

","In the movie that is suppose to take place in 1961 a song is being placed as her memory goes back to before 1961. A song is being played at a party called ""time has come today"". That recording was released in 1967 so the people that made this movie were clueless about the music of the time. I suspect there were other recordings that were in error such as Downtown ""1964"" by Petula Clark, and others. Why did these idiots use songs released after 1961 for a move about 1961. Did juveniles make this film? Was there no one over 60 involved in the production? The recordings before 1966 or 1967 was very different than after 1967. Groups like Paul Revere and the raiders,the Monkeys, and Motown ruled the airwaves. The Beatles,the Stones. the British invasion and the hippy era did become mainstream until after 1961.

","The problem with ""Girl, Interrupted"" is the treatment of its subject matter, mental illness. The film is well cast and the screenplay is reasonably sensitive, but it plays out like a Chick-Flick version of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"".<br/><br/>Substitute Winona Ryder for Brad Dourif and Angelina Jolie for Jack Nicholson, give the film a Hollywood ending and Bam! There's another worthy little classic in the can. ""Girl, Interrupted"" takes no chances and delivers a literal, layman's version of mental illness, an approach which left me cold and unsympathetic to the central character.<br/><br/>Despite a good performance from Winona Ryder, it's clear from Day One that her character shouldn't be in a psychiatric hospital. Okay, the film is based on Susanna Kaysen's genuine experience of mental illness but her hindsight shows through in the storytelling. The character Susanna's viewpoint is too objective for someone locked up in an asylum and the other patients are too stereotypically ""Mad"" to be entirely believable. It's as if the story is being told by someone who suffered from mental illness a long time ago.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie does her best as Lisa Rowe (the Jack Nicholson Looks-Normal Rebel character), but is let down by a script that quickly renders her as a walking cliché. It doesn't take long to work out that her rebel act will make her attractive to Ryder's character and that there's bound to be fireworks between such an odd couple. Predictably enough, after girly high-jinks give way to darker deeds, Susanna Kaysen decides that it's time to leave when Lisa Rowe finally breaks down. Kaysen then ""realises"" that her mental health issues aren't as severe as Rowe's, something that I'd worked out about an hour and a half earlier. Kaysen is ""merely"" depressed and confused, whereas Rowe is clearly borderline psychotic. It's clear from early on that one of them will soon walk back into a ""normal"" life while the other will have to struggle with inner demons and medication for many years. <br/><br/>I can't comment on Susanna Kaysen's book, but the film's viewpoint is too detached to be a credible account of a young woman's metal health problems. It wouldn't take many script changes to turn this movie into the story of a young journalist sent to an asylum to write an undercover piece for her newspaper. Although I have no doubt that the real Susanna Kaysen went through a very difficult period of mental illness as a young woman, her screen counterpart appears to be on some sort of nutter's field trip. While the film's approach may be realistic and sensitive, it conveys very little of the genuine anguish of mental illness."

2) Unless you stand in front of the mirror and confront your inner self, the battle for a better mental health continues.<br/><br/>The movie being based on the memoir written by the author during her stay at a mental institution, excels in bringing out the purest human emotions.

","In the spring of 1967, while everyone else in her senior class seems to be making plans for college, Susanna consumes a bottle of aspirin and a bottle of vodka. ""My hands have no bones,"" she observes. Soon, with a push from her family, she has committed herself to Claymoore, an upscale psychiatric institution. The diagnosis? ""Borderline personality disorder,"" say the shrinks. A supervising nurse played by Whoopi Goldberg offers her own diagnosis: ""You are a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who is driving yourself crazy."" Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen, whose real-life memoir tells of how she lost two years of her life by stumbling onto the psychiatric conveyor belt. Although mental illness is real and terrifying, the movie argues that perfectly sane people like Susanna can become institutionalized simply because once they're inside the system there is the assumption that something must be wrong with them. Goldberg's nurse has seen this process at work and warns Susanna: ""Do not drop anchor here."" But Susanna fits easily into the cocoon of Claymoore, where the other women include a rebel misfit named Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a roommate named Georgina (Clea Duvall) who would like to live in the land of Oz, the burn victim Polly (Elisabeth Moss), and the deeply troubled Daisy (Brittany Murphy). The staff is headed by a bureaucrat (Jeffrey Tambor) and an intelligent but detached psychiatrist (Vanessa Redgrave).<br/><br/>The film unfolds in an episodic way, like the journal it's based on. Themes make an appearance from time to time, but not consistently; the film is mostly about character and behavior and although there are individual scenes of powerful acting, there doesn't seem to be a destination. That's why the conclusion is so unsatisfying: The story, having failed to provide itself with character conflicts that can be resolved with drama, turns to melodrama instead.<br/><br/>One problem is the ambivalent nature of Susanna's condition (""ambivalent"" is one of her favorite words). She isn't disturbed enough to require treatment, but she becomes strangely absorbed inside Claymoore, as if it provides structure and entertainment she misses on the outside. Certainly Lisa is an inspiration, with her cool self-confidence masking deep wounds. Instead of being in a women's dorm at college, Susanna is in a women's dorm at Claymoore, where her subject of study is herself. Susanna is not therefore a captive of an evil system but someone seduced by a careless one, and there is the temptation to suspect she deserves what she gets.<br/><br/>Even a feminist argument with her psychiatrist (Redgrave) lacks power. They argue over the definition of promiscuity; Susanna points out that women are labeled promiscuous after much less sexual experience than men. Susanna has indeed slept in one day with both her boyfriend and an orderly, but under the circumstances is that promiscuity or opportunism? Jared Leto plays her boyfriend Toby, whose number is up in the draft lottery. He wants them to run away to Canada. She is no longer much interested in steering her future into their relationship and prefers her new friends in Claymoore. ""Them?"" says Toby. ""They're eating grapes off of the wallpaper."" Susanna chooses solidarity: ""If they're insane, I'm insane."" Wrong. They're insane, and she isn't, and that deprives the film of the kind of subterranean energy that fueled its obvious inspiration, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Two reasons to see the film: Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Their characters never really get a plot to engage them, and are subjected to a silly ending, but moment to moment, they are intriguing and watchable. Jolie is emerging as one of the great wild spirits of current movies, a loose cannon who somehow has deadly aim. Ryder shows again her skill at projecting mental states; one of her gifts is to let us know exactly what she's thinking, without seeming to. Their work here deserves a movie with more reason for existing.<br/><br/>S."

(May she rest in peace now). <br/><br/>Ryder's Susanna ends up in a mental institution after the incident with the aspirin and the vodka. She also experiments sexually (she's nineteen already, so it's about time! Although maybe not with your friend's dad). Just imagine you did that and ended up in a place like this. I felt for a lot of the characters, including the girl who seemed to be in just because she was gay.<br/><br/>At the mental institution Susanna meets Angelina Jolie's Lisa, who has serious behavioural problems, and has a sinister side (she will drive Daisy to commit suicide then steal her money). Together the out-of-touch teenagers embark on some adventures, until the hardy Lisa breaks down in a little-girl tantrum after a word-off with Susanna, whereas the cleverer Susanna realises the way to get out is to spill the beans in therapy - of course everyone, herself included, knew all along that she wasn't really crazy at all. <br/><br/>I don't mind that both Lisa and Susanna are wonderfully self-absorbed and self-serving characters. That's just crazy teenagers for you. What pushes my buttons a little though is the soppy end scene where Susanna says her goodbyes to some of the seriously ill people, as if she'd been one of them and now she's cured and getting out. But then, she never wanted to go there in the first place so maybe I'm being unfair.<br/><br/>This film left me feeling sad, but I enjoyed watching it."

","Girl, Interrupted is a thought provoking, highly intriguing drama, with amazing and Oscar winning performances from Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Clea DuVall, Elizabeth Moss and Whoopi Goldberg. <br/><br/>SOME SPOILERS<br/><br/>The film is set in the 60s when a confused young woman named Susannah Kaysen (Winona Ryder) is admitted to a Mental Hospital. The doctors decide that Susannah has a borderline personality and is Promiscuous. Susannah doesn't even understand her illness so how can she recover from it?<br/><br/>Whilst in the Hospital Susannah befriends other inmates such as Polly the sweet, innocent burn victim (Elizabeth Moss), the quiet, shy pathological liar Georgina (Clea DuVall), the blonde confident anorexic girl Janet (Angela Bettis), the sexually abused girl with an eating disorder Daisy (Brittany Murphy) and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), the strong, confident Sociopath. During her stay Susannah and her friends provide the film with heart-warming, sad, humorous and psychological moments that truly capture what the book intended. <br/><br/>Girl, Interrupted is a well shot, brilliantly acted and well structured film with an effective storyline, which captivates audiences. Angelina Jolie deserved her Oscar but wouldn't have achieved the success if it wasn't for those supporting her. Winona Ryder showcased one of her best performances for this film and no other actress could have fit the role of Susannah as well as she did.<br/><br/>This film is fantastic and recommended to all."

","I rushed to watch Girl, Interrupted because of one of my all-time favourite actress, Angelina Jolie, and I wasn't disappointed- she delivered a heart-wrenching performance as Lisa, the charming sociopath whom you would love to hate, yet become irresistibly drawn to. Angelina easily steals the show from Ryder with her portrayal of Lisa, the character who has the heart-strings of nearly all the other characters in the movie twisted around her little finger, and she is at times, insensitive and ruthless with the power in her words.<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>However, I was disappointed at how the film's plot seemed to go downhill after the first hour. Ryder's character seemed drawn towards the clinche ending as Susanna discovers that she does indeed have a problem and seeks to 'embrace' it and leave the hospital- her parting shot was rather tacky to me and it screwed up the earlier, not-so-bad performance in the movie.<br/><br/>the plot seemed to be incoherent- many points were made clear in the end, what was Susanna's problem? And Lisa's? Why were they giving her electric shocks?<br/><br/>For me, yet another highly anticipated point of the movie was when Lisa mistook Susanna for her former friend, Jamie, as they were making their get-away. A perfect setup for Jolie's character to seem to have really 'lost it' but it seemed to be taken as a passing remark and forgotten as the rest of the movie progressed and Lisa recovered from that remark as though it had never happened and goes to ruthless push Daisy's 'buttons'.<br/><br/>Over all, a movie that deserves to be watched- esp for angelina's EXCELLENT performance!"

","One-line summaries of this film often go something like this:<br/><br/>
""The story of a girl's mistaken confinement to a mental institution.""<br/><br/>I would argue that such a description misses the motivation behind Susanna's story.  This film, fabulously acted, intricately directed, and taken from an intensely written memoir, is about the inner workings of a troubled mind - that of Susanna Kaysen.<br/><br/>This troubled mind knows that something in it doesn't work right, and wants to fix it.  All levels of ""Girl, Interrupted"" speak to the us, the audience; it challenges us to search our own minds and discover the Susanna in us, challenges the very definition of sanity.  In the end, it asks us: to what lengths will you go to become a part of 'accepted' society - and are the 'normal' really any better than the crazy people?  To say that Susanna was mistakenly confined to a mental institution ignores the fact that every character at Claymoore was a true human being, whose story could have been told as effectively as Susanna's.  That Susanna left Claymoore testifies only that she was able and willing to be healed - not that she never belonged there in the first place.<br/><br/>This is a challenging, dramatic, profoundly effective movie - the voice of the author cries out for understanding in a world driven by image and desperate for acceptance."

","""Girl, Interrupted"" is a suspect film that over-achieves due to dynamite performances and formulaic processes that have worked in Hollywood for decades. The film is based on author Susanna Kaysen's (Winona Ryder) 18-month stay in a mental asylum in the 1960s. Writer-director James Mangold goes for something like Milos Forman's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and somewhat succeeds. Instead of men though, the film focuses on women of an asylum. Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie carries the film much like Jack Nicholson did in the aforementioned film. She is an energizer bunny of enthusiasm that the film had to have. Winona Ryder does good work, as she usually does. Whoopi Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave also do well in limited time. Overall the film is good, but nothing truly special. It lacks the heart and intelligence that made ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" so great in the mid-1970s. 4 stars out of 5."

Maybe in the 60s being depressed and wanting to die were grounds for instituionalization. But today - hell, half the people I know are like Ryder's character Susanna. Who the hell is happy with their life? Susanna just isn't a convincing patient. She doesn't seem all that sick and her hospital doesn't seem all that horrible. Hell, that hospital looked downright plush. Who wouldn't want to stay there? <br/><br/>Moreover, there is very little discussion of why Susanna is sick? Oh sure, she tried to kill herself - but so what. What about her parents, her life, her issues. All of this is glossed over so we can watch Angelina Jolie scream and say dirty words.  <br/><br/>However, I must admit, I was taken with Angelina Jolie's performance. I don't know if it was Oscar-worthy, but it was very good. She embodied that character very well. Although, as others have suggested, it isn't difficult for Angelina Jolie to play a bad girl.

","Girl, Interrupted is such a thought-provoking movie! Based on the real-life experience of Susanna Kaysen, who was in a pyschiatric institution in the 1960s, you really do start to wonder if, in that environment, you would go crazy, the way Susanna almost did. The story itself keeps your interest all the way, and the characters are all very realistic, moving and at times, almost comical. This is not to make light of the very serious issues the film covers - but there are some moments that make you smile, like when the girls go bowling in the basement at night. There were two things that I thought were excellent about this film - the acting, which was top notch, especially Angelina Jolie's fantastic performance as sociopath Lisa and Whoopi Goldberg as the understated nurse Valerie. I also thought that the way the film captured the essence of feeling depressed and mixed up was brilliant - Susanna's flashbacks, and the way very small things had great significance. All in all, I would say Girl, Interrupted is a great movie, and one to watch for anyone who has ever suffered from depression or felt just a little 'crazy'!"

","I love Wynona Ryder, she's one of my favorite actresses, but when I saw Angelina Jolie for the first time in a movie, this movie I was blown away. She was incredible as the likeable sociopath Lisa. I think if any other actress would have played this role I would have not really liked or cared for Lisa at all. But Jolie made her human and gave Lisa life underneath her devilish acts of terror and her hissably cool remarks that stung to the core. Of course beyond this remarkable performance by Jolie (who deservedly won an Academy award for her performance) was Ryder's character, Susanna who I could really identify with and still do. Depression is very real and the experiences she tells about are similar to what I have been through. I'm reading the book right now as well, and Susanna (more in the book) describes a parallel universe and the film displays this too along with other symptoms of depression even showing Susanna sleep a lot and certain noises, like a dog barking, bringing her back to certain places and her mind completely checking out of the present. This film is very thought provoking and well done and Ryder and Jolie are an amazing duo. Brittany Murphy was also powerful as Daisy. This film is a 9 out of 10. Excellent."

","Girl, Interrupted:  Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) has the distinction of being the only student in her graduating class with no post secondary plans - unless of course you count her desire to be a writer.  Her middle-class-cocktail-party-throwing-parents are mortified with the shiftless abomination they've raised, and make no attempt to hide their contempt.  When Susanna tries to cure a headache by swallowing a bottle of aspirin chased with a bottle of Vodka, she is sent to think things over in a sanitarium.  While there she meets the requisite cast of miscreants, malcontents, and maladjusted mental patients found in every asylum (at least in film).<br/><br/>Ryder is cast against type, stretching her talents to the limit in her portrayal as the dispossessed young woman whose bleak worldview is tempered only by her self-loathing.  It is a refreshing departure from her roles in such feel-good films as ""Heathers"" and ""Reality Bites"".  All kidding aside, this character was tailor-made for Ryder (she has a personal understanding of the subject matter having checked herself into a clinic at age 20 to deal with her anxiety), who was single-handedly responsible for bringing this story to the screen.  That is what makes her soulless, drawn, portrayal so disappointing. She spends the bulk of the film wandering about wide-eyed, confused, and virtually devoid of any emotion.  The film is not a complete waste however.<br/><br/>Once again Angelina Jolie manages to rise above the material she has to work with (""Playing God"" notwithstanding).  As Lisa she is prone to wild mood swings whether drug induced or natural.  A talented manipulator, she gets what she wants, by whatever means necessary.  Though Lisa is crazy, she always manages to keep her dignity, and Jolie never lets her become a caricature.  My only complaint is Lisa's epiphany near the end of the film - it is too contrived (I blame that on the writers, not Jolie).<br/><br/>Miss it."

","Some outstanding performances (including one Oscar winner) highlight this story of a young woman who loses a year of her life incarcerated in a mental hospital, mainly due to society's penchant at the time for institutionalizing even the borderline mentally infirm.  `Girl, Interrupted,' directed by James Mangold, is the story (based on her autobiography) of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young aspiring writer suffering from depression.  After what may or may not have been a suicide attempt (she chases a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka), she is spirited off to a private mental hospital, where she is diagnosed as having a `borderline personality defect.'  Simply put, it means she is young, intelligent and having trouble coping with an era (the 60s) and a world in a state of flux, as well as the pressure from her parents and peers to attend an upscale university.  Susanna, however, wants only to live life and write, and though she knows her own mind in this regard, the forces that surround her are too great, and she is torn between what she wants, and what the `world' expects.  All of which leads her into some gray areas in which time and space as she knows it suddenly does not necessarily coincide with the continuum of reality.<br/><br/>	A powerful film that makes a statement about tolerance and the methods of treatment available for the mentally ill, it underscores the necessity for compassion and understanding of those unable to function on their own.  And it successfully illustrates that in dealing with people in need, there must be a humanistic approach, as  it is more involved than merely separating the wheat from the chaff.<br/><br/>	As Susanna, Winona Ryder gives a performance that is both affecting and intense; she readily conveys the angst of a young woman confused, yet determined, who has yet to learn one of life's most valuable lessons:  Make the decision.  Susanna has been walking a fence that gets narrower with each step she takes, until finally, her fall to either one side or the other was inevitable.  What she had yet to learn at that point, was that it is better to stop before you reach the end of the fence, so as to be able to decide for yourself which way you're going to fall.  That way, for better or worse, at least you know that `you've' made the decision that's going to affect your life, which makes it easier to live with.  Susanna could have saved herself a lot of misery had she stated unequivocally to her parents, and most importantly to herself, that after High School graduation `this' is what I am going to do.  A hard concept to grasp, however, when one is eighteen and being pulled in opposite directions at the same time.<br/><br/>	In her Oscar winning performance, Angelina Jolie proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that, indeed, there is substance beneath the beauty.  As Lisa, the sociopath with an ice cube for a heart, she brings an enigmatic, intimidating presence to the screen.  A soulless miscreant, she thrives within the confines of the institution by bullying her way through every day of her life.  On the `outside,' however, she finds repeatedly that the bravura that works for her in confinement attracts only the kind of attention that gets her sent back again.  It's a dynamic, over-the-top, in-your-face performance for which she deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actress.  And, hopefully, after proving here what she is truly capable of, Jolie's career will successfully transcend her looks and that already famous pair of lips (though following this effort with the stagnating `Gone In 60 Seconds' does not bode well).  <br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Clea DuVall (Georgina), Brittany Murphy (Daisy), Elisabeth Moss (Polly), Jared Leto (Tobias), Jeffrey Tambor (Dr. Potts), Vanessa Redgrave (Dr. Wick), Whoopi Goldberg (Valerie), Mary Kay Place (Mrs. Gilcrest), Kurtwood Smith (Dr. Crumble) and Angela Bettis (Janet).  A somewhat disturbing film, `Girl, Interrupted' will affect you on any number of emotional levels and will command, not only your attention, but your involvement.  Simply put, this is riveting drama that refuses to let you off the hook for even a moment.  There's a message in here about the perspectives and significance of society as a whole, but more importantly, about the impact an individual can make on our world and the people around us, and of the importance of forging ahead and making a decision before it's too late.  I rate this one 8/10."

","Originally, I was going to proclaim Girl Interrupted as ""a modern day 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'"". Until I remembered that Girl takes place in the late 60's, and I believe that Cuckoo's Nest takes place in the 70's (although I could be wrong...) thus making the modern compliment a little confusing. <br/><br/>Both films deal with asylums and mental illness, but while Nicholson's character slowly slides into madness, Winona Ryder's character (Suzanna) slowly pulls herself out of it. Not that she was totally crazy anyway. She was withdrawn, introspective, and dissatisfied with her lot in life. One botched attempt at a suicide, and the next thing she knows, she's being introduced to everybody at a mental ward. She eventually befriends the women staying there... Daisy, a girl whom only eats chickens from her father's deli, and stores the bones beneath her bed... Polly, a perpetually happy girl whom burned half of her face off as a child... Valerie, a nurse with a very patient demeanor played by Whoopi Goldberg... and then there's Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. Lisa is a rebel, and is constantly fighting with the doctors and nurses. At first this seems to be because she has everything figured out, and is too smart to be in a mental hospital. But as Suzanna and the audience later discover, that's not the case at all.<br/><br/>
Suzanna and Lisa develop an uneasy friendship, and at the times when Lisa turns on Suzanna, the movie takes on a bit of a horror feel, such as the underground scene near the end. It also creates some hilarious scenes, like Suzanna's confrontation with a mother of one of her former classmates in the ice cream shop.<br/><br/>I wasn't aware that Girl Interrupted is actually based on the real life experience of writer Susanna Kaysen. This fact alone gives me even more respect for the film, as I imagine it may be quite difficult for her to revisit that time of her life. <br/><br/>Don't be fooled into thinking this is a ""chick flick"". True, 90% of the main characters are women, but this is a hard hitting movie that everybody can watch and come away with a slightly different perspective on life. As the tagline says... Sometimes the only way to stay sane is to go a little crazy. How true."

","Definitely not just a ""chick flick"", Girl, Interrupted is an underrated little gem. Perhaps the best mental-hospital movie since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder is Susanna, a 60's sensitive type who commits herself to a mental institution after she takes a bottle of aspirin to cure a headache. We are then introduced to the inmates who will quickly form Susanna's clique: Daisy (Brittany Murphy), an anorexic daddy's girl; Polly (Elisabeth Moss), whose horrifically scarred face masks her innate sensitivity; and Lisa (Jolie), a free-spirited sociopath who has turned asylum escapes into an artform. Of course, the girls bond (though never in a sickly way), and have ""adventures"" (midnight bowling, sneaking a peek at their psychiatric reports); yet this is never as cute as you might think, director Mangold always injecting the proceedings with a slight, distinctly anti-Tinseltown edge.<br/><br/>The performances are incredible, Winona Ryder is at her best, Britanny Murphy pulls off a strong, believeable appearance as Daisy and Whoopi Goldberg is typically great. But, here, Angelina Jolie is the real sparkle. Girl, Interrupted is HER movie, and it bought her into stardom, she won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her moving, memorable performance as Lisa. Director James Mangold's direction is cruelly underrated, his effort is extremely impressive.

","Girl, Interrupted is one of the top ten best movies of 1999 (better than the highly overrated American Beauty and the tedious The Green Mile), an involving and interesting drama that catches your attention from start to finish without appealing to over-the-top and exaggerated dramatic scenes.It's a fresh, agile and often funny entertainment that leaves you by the end with a smile on the face .In my point of view, the main theme wasn't the question of ""what's sane and what's insane"", the real goal was to show how friendship is important for our lives and how it's imperative to keep a good-heart and be noble and human even at the most disgusting moments of life. In another director's hands, Girl, Interrupted could ended up being the typical Hollywood tear-jerker, but I have to give kudos for James Mangold (the guy responsible for the efficient and underrated Copland), who inspired terrific performances by a great cast (specially by Brittany Murphy, she is an actress you should keep an eye on - expect to hear a lot about this talented, beautiful and charming young woman on the years to come) and told the story in a realistic manner(what makes Girl, Interrupted seems a little bit hard in some parts), but also leaving a positive and upbeat felling in the audiences as the story develops the relationship between the characters. That's when we understand that a friend always makes a difference in our lives."

I thought she played the role of Susanna Kaysen remarkably. I pictured Winona playing that part when I read the book. I thought the story line and how they wrote was fantastic and the acting was beyond amazing.......it was miraculous and I am very happy to be writing this review because everyone who made this movie should be very proud of themselves. Angelina Jolie was beautiful playing Lisa the way she did. She definitely deserved her Oscar for that! She was fantastic as the psycho Lisa and i am very impressed by her.

","This is not a story of good guys and bad guys. A subtle, multi-layered portrait of mental disorder and reactions thereto. Intriguingly, it is eschews fashionable ""social constructivist"" approach to psychology: that psyches are merely ""constructs"" of their society/gender/class (take your pick). The heroine, Suzanna, begins by denying her suicidal tendency and signs herself into a psychiatric institute. She becomes acquainted with her inmates and her keepers. This drama, set in the 'Sixties, relays her relationship with the external institution from which she cannot escape and the personal strictures imposed upon herself to which she is bound. ""Escape"" and the conundrum of escaping oneself is a central remit of this character study. Picaresque in nature, the thematic substance is revealed in the subtle remarks and clamorous exchanges. Unlike ""Idioterne"", mental disorder is not portrayed as the sole rational reaction to society - that, in a world gone mad, ""being mad"" is the only authentic (truthful, even) response. This movie surpasses ""One Flew . . ."" in its depiction of mental illness. We cannot cheer the protagonist at the end, because this is not a cheer-leading exercise. Rather, this is a satisfying evocation of the Mental Health System and its stumbling attempts to prepare people for Normal Life."
"spanner-7","Null","0","0","10 October 2000"," not bad, but not really convincing
","I found Girl, Interrupted fairly interesting but ultimately unconvincing and I put this largely down to one thing: the feeling that Winona Ryder's ""Susanna"" was an observer of the institution in which the film is set rather than a resident.<br/><br/>The opening of the film is composed of an interesting array of incidents of Susanna's life thus far, and jumps around through time between them. As Susanna describes her experience of being ""unable to control time"" to her doctor, we are clearly supposed to gather that this non-linear progression represents Susanna's experience of her illness. (Although, frankly, I wasn't aware that many people could ""control time"". I'm sure I can't).<br/><br/>But from this promising beginning nothing develops. After her first dream- (or hallucination-) filled night on the ward, there is no sign whatsoever of Susanna's illness. She spends her time getting to know, and in some cases helping, the other patients but gives the impression more of a journalist doing research than a patient receiving treatment. At one point she becomes depressed by the behaviour of Lisa (the excellent, and much more intriguing Angelina Jolie) and the death of a fellow patient, but even this manifests itself as nothing more than a reluctance to get out of bed. At no point do we get an insight into why she is still there or what she requires treatment for.<br/><br/>Whilst I do grasp that part of the point of the movie is that she was never really all that ill, and was sent to the institution as much for her parent's convenience as for her own mental well-being, she clearly does consider herself to have been ill and to be ""better"" by the time she leaves. I simply never really noticed any symptoms during most of her stay, from which she could be said to need to recover."

","Maybe it was because I was having a bad day.  But by the end of this movie, I was sobbing- no, not just CRYING-...SOBBING! It was so sad to me that some girls think they are crazy or dysfunctional, (I wasn't feeling sad for Ryder's character, I                         *associated* more with her), when really, they probably just need someone to say the right thing, or ""Shhh..., it's ok. I love you."", instead of ""Check!"" and ""Time for your pills.""<br/><br/>
   OK, someone mentioned they didn't really like any character in this movie. For me, it wasn't that I liked the characters that much, but I wasn't looking at one character; I was drawing my likes and dislikes from each one.<br/><br/>What I mean by that is, the things that made one girl seem insane, I used that as sympathy for the other girls.  For example: the girl with the burned face. She is probably the sweetest one in the asylum, but she is also too sensitive, and drives people crazy over it, which can make viewers understand more of what the other girls go through from being with each other. <br/><br/>
  SPOILER   WARNING    SPOILER  WARNING   -----<br/><br/>
    I think the reason Susanna didn't want to leave the asylum when she had the opportunity WASN'T because she thought she was nuts, but because she was seeking some truth in herself. She wanted to know for sure what set her apart from these other girls. She wanted to know, -not JUST know- but really FEEL, in her heart, what defined 'crazy'. As time passed, by observing the other girls (especially Lisa), she came to her own conclusion in the end. <br/><br/>    She found that being NORMAL or CRAZY isn't the point. What matters is if you're ALIVE or just DEAD inside. Susanna was 'alive' *because* she was seeking answers, *because* she had compassion for the other girls. In the end, Lisa, who Susanna called 'dead inside', was the only girl who convinced us that she belonged there, that she was insane; because she just couldn't function if she considered herself sane. This is evident from the movie, because Susanna chose to stay at Daisy's house even after she had hung herself, because she had *compassion*. Also, Susanna CHOSE to stay, even though she knew it would mean going back to the asylum. However, Lisa left Daisy uncaring, and was caught. This proves that even though Lisa wants to act powerful, she cannot live outside the asylum before she is forcefully brought back in.<br/><br/><br/><br/>END  SPOILER   END  SPOILER    --------------<br/><br/><br/><br/>    You probably won't want to see this a second time right away....especially if you've ever questioned your own sanity, because some scenes can be a bit depressing. But I can safely say that James Mangold does an *EXCELLENT* job directing this movie. He seems to handle the mood just right. So, this makes the material much easier to watch, and more thought-provoking.<br/><br/>SLIGHT  SPOILER   SLIGHT SPOILER There was one part thing I wish I could understand; the mataphor that goes with Susanna Kaysen's hand.

Ryder's voice over narration still sounds like ""Heathers,"" but her overall performance is somewhat better. Clearly, the film belongs to Jolie, who is superb (when is she not?) as Lisa, the possible sociopath who has a bad habit of helping out her fellow committed neighbors.

This movie is based on the memoirs of an eighteen year old young woman confined to a psychiatric hospital in the mid 60s.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen, who was put in a mental ward, because her parents felt she was lifeless and had no aspirations. She would over dose on aspirin in hopes of dulling the headaches caused by not feeling part of any particular social loop.<br/><br/>Ryder proves her talents in this role. Her expressions make up for the script that sometimes comes up laking. The movie though is stolen away from Miss Rider by co-star Angelina Jolie. Jolie plays a tough, raw and seductive psychotic mainstay in the asylum. The give and take relationship developing among a circle of patients is carefully recorded in Kaysen's journal. Kaysen manages to come to grips with reality and is deemed ready to join the outside 'normal' world.<br/><br/>There are a few, brief comical moments; but the movie is big time depressing. It is interesting enough to make you want to pick up a copy of the book.<br/><br/>Whoopi Goldberg actually surprised me. Her role as nurse Valerie was very good.

","Until I actually rented the DVD I didn't realize ""Girl, Interrupted"", is based on a real person, Susanna Kaysen, who based her book on experiences in 1967 and 1968 as a teenager in a mental institution. As with many, many teenagers, it turns out she is far from being ""crazy"", just lazy about addressing her hang-ups, and resisting ""growing up.""<br/><br/>I rate this movie a solid 8 of 10. The acting is uniformly good, including Caryn Elaine Johnson as nurse Valerie. Of course Angeline Jolie won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Winona Ryder, who also produced the movie, has the lead role of Susanna Kaysen, and she does her usual superb job. In a brief role as Dr. Wick, Vanessa Redgrave I feel gave perhaps the most believable performance of all. <br/><br/>Many older movies involving mental institutions exaggerate the conditions and happenings in them. This one did not. The portrayals were very realistic, the ""inmates"" as well as the staff. The film did a neat job of relating Dorothy's quest to get home in the ""Wizard of Oz"" to Susanna's quest to get out of the hospital and live a normal life. This worked well for this movie.<br/><br/>The DVD has some interesting features, including an interview with the real Susanna Kaysen who is now about 50. In photos of her at 17 she looks remarkably like Winona Ryder's characterization. However, she has not ""aged very gracefully"", if you know what I mean!  :-) The deleted scenes were mostly to shorten the original cut of the film from over 3 hours to just over 2 hours. Parts of the film move a bit slowly and 3 hours would have been way too much. One of the deleted scenes relates the title of the movie to the painting, ""Girl, Interrupted.""<br/><br/>Overall a good film, gets you thinking about life, and makes you glad you somehow survived your own teenage years.<br/><br/>One more thing.

Especially my favorite, Whoopi Goldberg.  Each and every cast member gave an important touch but anyone who has been hospitalized or who works in a mental hospital knows that each patient finds one or two people who make the difference when it counts.  Every staff member that cares hopes they will find a person that gives them hope and will to work toward health.

","Maybe it's time for me to take another look at ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" - I don't remember it being particularly good, certainly not as good as this.  Forman may be a better director than Mangold, but there's little evidence he can tell good material from bad.  (Sometimes he stumbles across good material by accident, and the result is an ""Amadeus"".)  ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a film that actually cares about making US care about the inmates.  I found myself growing very fond of Susanna and Lisa despite taking an intense initial dislike to both - how much more agreeable the company of the mad but intelligent is to that of the sane but stupid, I found myself thinking - and in no time at all I was hooked, and moved.  And unless my memory plays me false this is also a SMARTER film than ""Cuckoo"", as well as being a more touching one.<br/><br/>Okay, Mangold does have his weaknesses.  Anyone who has to resort to a song montage might as well hold up a title card saying ""I don't know how to portray the passage of time""; the last fifteen minutes appears to consist of five consecutive endings (Forman ended HIS film cleanly, I'll give him that); and while we may have needed Susanna's first-person narration to lead us into the story, we certainly didn't need it to lead us out.  It's easy to forgive all of this.  Besides, Mangold has positive virtues to compensate: he knows how to pace, and, as I said before, he knows how to make us love the characters.<br/><br/>I should mention few incidental pleasures.  One of them, surprisingly, is Whoopi Goldberg.  Who would have thought it, but she actually portrays a character that isn't her usual arch, smug one, in a role in which it would have been easy to lapse into arch smugness - and she does it well.  Also, you'll have to admit, ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a great title.  How could anyone NOT bear good will to a film with a title like that?  Moreover, ""Downtown"" is a great song; I don't care who knows I think so."

","The formula for `Girl, Interrupted' is to take the basic setting and plot situation of `One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,' strip them of their high-falutin' melodramatic elements and present a somewhat more realistic image of insanity hidden behind the walls of a mental institution.  The risk in such a move is that the film will, also, strip away much of the drama as well.  `Girl, Interrupted' takes the risk and, perhaps predictably, is not a completely satisfying effort as a result.  Long stretches of the film turn into drawn out gabfests in which the girls housed in this Massachusetts institution talk out their issues at frequently excessive length. However, thanks to strong performances by an impressive cast of highly talented young actresses, as well as a script filled with occasionally sharp insights into the complexities of mental illness, the film ultimately yields a moving and rewarding cinematic experience for those with the patience to see it through to the end.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true-life story of Susanna Kaysen, a young woman who, like many young people in the turbulent 1960's, felt disoriented in the face of great social upheaval and the redefining of traditional roles and came to question her own place in society as a result.  For a fumbled attempt at suicide, Susanna was ultimately consigned to a yearlong stay at a New England psychiatric hospital.  It is her experiences there - and the relationships she forged with other women in her ward - that form the backbone of the film.<br/><br/>Several elements serve to undercut some of the credibility of the film. As overseen by an ever-sympathetic head nurse (Whoopi Goldberg), this ward seems woefully lax in its standards of both discipline and security.  The girls seem to run freely and wildly through the corridors at all times, popping in and out of each other's rooms, talking disrespectfully to the staff on hand, entertaining strange young men in their rooms under direct gaze of the people who work there and even bolting from the place entirely with astonishing frequency.  Moreover, the girls certainly do not seem to be kept very busy with either chores or therapy sessions and, as a result, we often wonder what exactly the therapeutic modus operandi of this hospital is.  In a weak echo of  `Cuckoo's Nest,' the girls are taken out into a public setting - an ice cream parlor - with predictably disastrous results. Even worse in that scene is the confrontation that occurs between Susanna and a friend of her parents who it seems has wised up to the fact that Susanna and her husband once had a sexual fling.  The incredibility is not in the confrontation per se, but in the fact that this mother would make such an embarrassingly public scene right in front of her own understandably chagrined daughter.<br/><br/>On the whole, however, the film sports enough virtues of performances and writing to triumph over its flaws.  Winona Ryder, in what might well be her finest performance to date, conveys the combination of melancholic wistfulness and hard-edged cynicism essential to her essentially decent but deeply troubled character.  Neither the writers, Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan, nor writer/director James Mangold ever allow us to bank on the extent of Susanna's madness.  Since she herself is never quite sure whether she is truly insane or just deeply depressed and emotionally confused, we are never given the opportunity to peg her with a pat diagnosis either.  The same goes for her fellow inmates, particularly Lisa, stunningly portrayed by Angelina Jolie, whose often-lethal combination of beguiling charm and cold-blooded ruthlessness, keeps us as off balance as it does Susanna.<br/><br/>Certainly, mental illness is one of the most difficult conditions to render credible on the screen.  The risks lie in either overstating the mannerisms and actions into seeming absurdity or of providing resolutions that ring hollow in their upbeat simplicity.  `Girl, Interrupted' falls into both traps occasionally, but the fact that it is a work culled from a real person's personal experiences makes us more prone to accept it at face value.   At times the girls seem too facile in their respective natures - one is a pathological liar, one a repressed lesbian, one a deceitful sociopath, one a self-deluded incest victim etc. - yet each character also contains her personal element of truth and validity.  Only Whoopi Goldberg's anti-Nurse Ratched character rings untrue.  Perhaps Goldberg has simply gone once too often to this particular well - that of the overly sympathetic authority figure dripping heartfelt sincerity all over the miserable and the hurting.  As an actress, she has long ago lost her edge.<br/><br/>Still, for all its weaknesses, `Girl, Interrupted' emerges as a genuinely poignant and moving study of a group of hurting individuals groping towards each other for hope and understanding.  For all the voices of reason shouting at us to question its authenticity, we find ourselves wanting desperately to believe in this unusual and thought-provoking tale"

"josh-178","Null","0","0","16 July 2000"," Quite a disappointment
","Girl, Interrupted is a movie which attempts to relate the rocky, trauma-fraught teenage years of Susanna Kaysen. While I have not read the book, I was interested in the presentation of the subject matter, which has been covered successfully and not-so-successfully in a number of films, such as ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" and ""Lisa, Bright and Dark"".<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed. The movie proved to be more of a caricature of the subject matter than any sort of revelation. Having studied the institutionalization period of mental illness treatment history (from the 40's to the 70's), I found the depiction of the psychiatric hospital and its staff to be shallow, one-dimensional, and just plain stupid. A justification could be made that the movie presented this depiction from Kaysen's perspective, but if I were Kaysen, I would be disappointed in the film.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Jack Green, who was greatly responsible for the success of ""The Bridges of Madison County"", helps to provide the atmosphere necessary for the tension-based story, but James Mangold, who did a good job with ""Copland"", strikes out as writer/director in this film. The subject matter provides a lot of freedom to improvise, but Mangold gives us predictability to the point of being hackneyed. The focus is more on the ""hey, man, look at me being crazy"" set of experiences than the true depths of dispair of the characters. Mangold simply doesn't fill out the characters well, missing out on the integrity and depth required from them to connect on an emotional level. He seems to use a story structural mechanism similar to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", where one prominent character (here named Lisa) helps to involve the other characters in the story as associates. However, Mangold misses the key connection in ""One"", that the other characters and their plight provide the motivation for McMurphy's acting-out. That sense of life-and-death for Lisa is not explored in this movie.<br/><br/>Jack Green, who was greatly responsible for the success of ""The Bridges of Madison County"", helps to provide the atmosphere necessary for the tension-based story, but focuses too much on Rather, we have to get sensationalized from the Lisa character <br/><br/>Despite the lack of integrity The acting is good despite the weak script. Wynona Ryder turns a believable, steady performance despite a sense that the script doesn't really explore the intricacies of the character. Angelina Jolie is certainly a fine actress who excels at over-the-top roles, but I didn't find this to be one of her more memorable efforts. I much prefer her in ""Gia"" and ""Foxfire"" than what seems to be a somewhat shrill effort here. I was a bit amazed that she won an Oscar for her work here when there were so many good supporting performances from which to choose. Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave provide familiar, reliable faces for supporting roles.<br/><br/>One reviewer described the movie as "" The teen-bopper's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"". I agree somewhat with that description, though ""One"" was far superior in almost every area, starting with the storyline. The film probably does succeed best as a vehicle to which troubled teenagers can relate. In a day and age where things move so fast and where so much is expected of children by their peer groups and parents, it's good to have something to which to relate."

","Over the years I seem to have developed a certain suspicion of movies that advertise themselves as ""emotional"", ""touching"", etc.  The problem is that these movies are very phony; any semblance of human depth and true emotion only comes through in cliches and worn out plot devices.<br/><br/>I immediately understood the direction that the film was going to take when a suicide is announced early in the film.  Unfortunately most of us have had some sort of experience with suicide at some point of our lives, it is a thing that scars us, or at least haunts us for some time.  In the film, however, little is revealed about the girl who killed herself; it's obvious the filmmakers are just looking for a quick emotion shot, throwing around a suicide just to create some sort of dreary, mental hospital atmosphere that is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the film.  On paper, it all looks very calculated and laid out, in the film, it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Spontaneity lacks, of course, when director and screenwriter allow plot to succumb to trick and tactic.  As the movie moves into the middle to last acts, it lags horribly, and to shake things up another suicide is presented, this time in much more gruesome fashion.  However, I found the dead girl's personality just too much of a cliche and lacking in any real depth to care for her.  Again the filmmakers insult the audience's intelligence.<br/><br/>To top it off, the ending is a cartoon ending, where everyone stands around laughing.  Poor, poor, poor.  The plot goes nowhere, we learn nothing about the cardboard characters presented, and to my dismay I swear that a part of the soundtrack rips off from ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (maybe I'm imagining it).<br/><br/>Another failed ""chick-flick"".<br/><br/>6 of 10."

","Girl, Interrupted<br/><br/>After a failed suicide attempt, a sad teenage woman named Susanna (Winona Ryder) is sent to Claymoore, a mental institution in suburban Boston. It is there that Susanna reluctantly tries to find the help that she needs. Ingratiating herself in the microcosm of the hospital, Susanna is confronted with true mental instability and tries to reach within her newfound friends and see why she has resisted life for so long.<br/><br/>From the novel by Susanna Kaysen, GIRL, INTERRUPTED can be easily summed up as a female ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, but that doesn't necessarily do justice to GIRL. Directed by James Mangold (COPLAND), GIRL is a very satisfying, moving drama with an arresting cast of twenty-somethings on the brink of stardom. Angelina Jolie, Brittany Murphy (CLUELESS), Clea Duvall (THE FACULTY), and Whoopi Goldberg head the cast with the aforementioned Ms. Ryder. There is a swimming pool full of talented people to gaze upon in this film, yet the raw talent of Ryder makes it worth the time. Angelina Jolie makes another misstep in her career (after BONE COLLECTOR) by playing her unstable character Lisa like the rebel wild child that mirrors Jolie in real life. This might be explained away as a character trait, but too many moments in GIRL showcase Jolie absurdly playing to the rafters. An actress of such uncontested power, Jolie suffers from trying to conquer the world with a performance that is often without subtlety. While the current rash of awards keeps the glow on Jolie, Ryder turns in one of her best performances. As the meek and confused Susanna, there isn't a false moment anytime Ryder is onscreen.<br/><br/>The trouble with GIRL is the predictable - but needed - attempt to ground the somewhat lighthearted first half of the film into hard core drama. Like the schizophrenic personalities that inhabit Claymoore, GIRL, INTERRUPTED is like watching two completely different films at once. An experience that is positively frustrating. Trying hard to keep the focus steady, Mangold lets the film get away from him in the second act; with a climax that does little to resolve the story.<br/><br/>It is Ryder and most of the cast that makes GIRL end up being a winner. You walk away from GIRL, INTERRUPTED with the nagging feeling that most of the details are missing, yet satisfied that the film gave us such a wealth of talent to behold.------- 7"

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>I tend to the sentimental, so the fact that I cried through most of the last twenty minutes of this touching and redemptive story of lost little women in the booby hatch doesn't mean much. This really isn't a tear-jerker as such, it's just that the material and the way it is handled made me feel such affection for those girls struggling so hard to be whole. Set in New England in the sixties with Vietnam in the background and free love in the streets, this is a fine film with an excellent cast that tells an original story without mawkish sentimentality or any pandering to the politically correct. The psychotherapeutic industry is not indicted, nor is society held over the coals. Everything is individual and the faults and failures are individual faults and failures, and the ultimate redemption or lack there of is also individual.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder gives a striking performance as 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, writer to be who finds herself in a mental institution after a suicide attempt. Ryder, who has the expressive face of a silent film star, proves beyond any doubt that she is a gifted and tremendously hard working actress.<br/><br/>Trickster Angelina Jolie is fascinating in her academy-award winning supporting role as a kind of femme bad boy. Whoopi Goldberg as a Nurse Ratched with a heart, anchors the film and brings strength and rationality to the lives of the girls. Vanessa Redgrave, elegant and wise as Dr. Wick, a shrink with compassion and intelligence, serves as a counterbalance to Jeffrey Tambor's incompetent Dr. Potts.<br/><br/>Some have compared this to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) but this is an entirely different kind of movie. It has neither the range nor the outrageous humor of that great film. Director James Mangold, whose much admired Heavy (1995) showed what he can do, wisely attempts less here as he concentrates on the personal journey Susanna Kaysen takes to the brink of institutionalized insanity and back. He emphasizes how people can bond and show affection under dysfunctional circumstances, and how we can triumph over the darker aspects of our nature. In the final analysis, this is a heroic film and a tribute to those who rise above the demons in their souls."

I'm sorry she didn't get an Oscar nod for that performance - she certainly deserved one.

","""Girl, Interrupted"" (**1/2) seems to have been designed by Winona Ryder as an Oscar grabbing vehicle for herself.  Young woman recovering from an emotional breakdown in a posh mental hospital?  Can't miss.  She must have been royally miffed when Angelina Jolie ran off with the award instead (poor Winona wasn't even nominated).  Truth to tell, Miss Ryder is a little whiny and tiresome as a ""spoiled, self-indulgent little girl"" (as Whoopi Goldberg in her wise oracle mode describes her).  It's never quite clear what her problem is other than that she would rather write than go to college and that her mother doesn't appear to like her very much.  (She won't even accompany her daughter to the institution; she has to go over in a cab!) Miss Jolie has also been indulged by director James Mangold to showboat all over the place in a sort of female Jack Nicholson role as the toughest cookie in the place.  Now if someone had only known that all it took to break her was to tell her she was coldhearted and dead inside, she wouldn't have been in there for eight years!  Implausibilities abound:  Security appears to be largely non-existent and the girls seem to have the run of the place.  In one absurd sequence they adjourn to the basement for some bowling and then break into the head doctor's office to check out their files.  When Ryder wants to get a musical instrument out of the supply room after hours she simply asks Jolie for the keys!  Generally, the film is well made: director Mangold interweaves the flashbacks that dot the first half-hour in a very skillful manner; for once, I felt that I could even keep track of what was going on.  The film is absorbing in the manner of such flamboyant mental institution/prison melodramas of yore as ""The Snake Pit"", ""Caged, "" ""The Caretakers"" or ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.""  I just didn't buy most of it, the ultra-sentimental wrap-up least of all."

","Girl Interrupted' suffers from comparisons with One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', perhaps a bit unfairly since they were different kinds of stories. Possibly the reason for this is that the story presented like Cuckoo Lite. This story begged for some character development, especially of Lisa.  It is essentially a slice of life film.  There was no real plot, just a succession of incidents at the institution.<br/><br/>For a slice of life film to be successful, there must be character development or situations that are so unique and fascinating that they compensate for the story's lacking a plotline.  In Cuckoo's Nest' despite having little character development, the situations were intense and Jack Nicholson commanded our attention in every frame.  G.I. fell short in both areas.  It was unquestionably an interesting character study of both Suzanna (Winona Ryder) and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), but the flashbacks of Suzanna's life were too sketchy to provide much insight into the problems with which she struggled, and Lisa's past was a total mystery.  Though Jolie's performance was truly outstanding, as was Ryder's, together they failed to create a performance strong enough to compensate for what the story lacked.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold gets credit for a story sensitively told and his direction of the actors was excellent.  This was generally a very well acted film.  Angelina Jolie continues to impress in difficult and gutsy roles. She is a very gritty performer and is fantastic at pouring out raw emotion with no holds barred.  Hopefully this performance will help her emerge from the shadows of supporting actor to land the lead she deserves.<br/><br/>Wynona Ryder delivered another mature and powerful performance.  She is quite accomplished at playing complex and tormented characters.  One day, I would love to see her in something that departs from her accustomed dour roles.  While watching the featurette included on the DVD, I noticed she actually does possess a genuinely happy smile.  It occurred to me at that moment that this was the first time I'd seen it.  The only smile she ever gets a chance to use in character is her wounded smile.<br/><br/>I rated this film a 7/10.

","18 year old Susanna (played by Academy Award Nominee Winona Ryder) is disillusioned with reality and so she overdoses. As a result, she is checked into a mental hospital for her disorder. However, she has trouble coping with that too, and things turn even more dramatic when she meets a crazy patient named Lisa (played by Academy Award Winner Angelina Jolie).<br/><br/>I have no idea why this got mixed reviews when it first came out because it is a great film! A lot of it is because of the performances. First off, let's start with Ryder. She is a very capable lead who is struggling not just to fit in with the patients of the mental institution, but also with herself and how to deal with the effects of her disorder. She portrays that struggle very well, showing us that Susanna was indeed a real person. The film also boasts an incredible supporting cast including Academy Award Winners Whoopi Goldberg, Vanessa Redgrave and Jared Leto, all of whom do fine work in what little screen time they have (okay, maybe not so much with Goldberg, but you get my drift). But the star of the show is without a doubt Angelina Jolie. I don't feel like her Oscar win was deserved (it should have gone to Toni Collette for The Sixth Sense), but she definitely is the one who deserved the nomination and all the recognition for this movie. She is the reason to watch this movie and, in this movie, she proves that the acting chops that her father had have indeed been passed down to her.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, go and watch this movie! Definitely a great movie!"

"romanorum1","8","1","2","3 May 2016"," Based upon the Autobiography of Susanna Kaysen
","In 1967, 18 year-old neurotic and volatile Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), who attempted to commit suicide by downing a bottle of vodka and a bottle of aspirin, is rushed to a local hospital. Not only is her family life an unhappy one (despite the family's influence), but also she is confused as what to do with her life. She is in denial about her motives, and is also promiscuous. After she has survived emergency medical care, she is sent to Claymoore, a psychiatric institution in Belmont, Massachusetts. As Susanna stays for one and one-half years, her outside life has become interrupted. (Actually the title emanates from Vermeer's 17th century painting.)<br/><br/>The hospital staff is headed by an administrator who appears to be a caring and decent man, Dr. Melvin Potts (Jeffrey Tambor) and an intelligent but detached psychiatrist Dr. Sonia Wick (Vanessa Redgrave). The supervisor on the ward is hardened nurse Valerie Owens (Whoopi Goldberg). Valerie calls Susanna ""a lazy, self- indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy.""<br/><br/>Placed in a women's ward, Susanna eventually receives her diagnosis: ""borderline personality disorder."" She is ambivalent and seems to deserve what she gets even though one knows that she does not really belong in Claymoore. When she tells boyfriend Toby (Jared Leto) that she has friends there, he replies, ""They are eating grapes off the wallpaper."" But Claymoore seems to give her the structure that she needs. Earlier, a nurse had warned her, ""Do not drop anchor here."" When tragedy ultimately strikes one of the inmates, Susanna seriously begins to self-examine herself and begins to cooperate with the therapists. Mentally she becomes less confused and healthier, and starts writing about her experiences. Although her book became the basis for the movie, the latter unfortunately takes many liberties. The movie, about behavior and character, is told dramatically via a series of episodes. These events include: female patient interactions; the girls breaking into the main office after hours and reading individual files; the Christmastime trip to the ice cream parlor; exercise classes; the attempt to escape; the final melodramatic confrontation in the basement. In reality, some of these events never really happened but were added in by Hollywood for dramatic effect. <br/><br/>The other women Susanna meets at the hospital include: <br/><br/> Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) – a rebel misfit, sociopath, and reckless; manipulative and cruel; doesn't care whom she hurts; becomes Susanna's friend. <br/><br/> Georgina Tuskin (Clea Duwall) – a shy and withdrawn person; suffers from schizophrenia; lives in the Land of Oz; doesn't really want to leave Claymoore; diagnosed as ""pseudologica fantastica,"" a pathological liar; Susanna's roommate. <br/><br/> Polly Clark (Elizabeth Moss) – a schizophrenic but kindly burn victim who is also depressed with her face; will never leave Claymoore; called ""Torch"" by Lisa. <br/><br/> Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) – a deeply troubled individual with an anxiety disorder; harbors a dreadful secret. <br/><br/> Janet Webber (Angela Bettis) – an anorexic ballerina; easily irritated; called ""Fatso"" by Lisa. <br/><br/> Cynthia Crowley (Jillian Armenante) – a mentally-disturbed lesbian; severely depressed. <br/><br/>Winona Ryder, who bears more than just a physical resemblance to the author of the book, is expressive and skillful at projecting mental states. She is always good. Angelina Jolie drives the movie and gives it life. Her demeaning of those around her left her a cold heart, dead inside. Jolie's haunting performance won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite some film flaws, there are the strong presentations by an impressive cast of highly talented young actresses. Also, the script contains some sharp insights into the complexities of mental illness."

","The most striking thing about Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) might be that she is just an ordinary person like you and me. Sure she might see things but that's probably just because of smoking pot and partly a coping mechanism for a difficult situation at home and in school.<br/><br/>Girl, Interrupted shows us how an impressionable teenage girl suffers from mild depression, meets various colorful people in an mental institution and tries to find her place among them and in the world. Lisa is a strong and influential character, played scarily and crazily by Angelina Jolie. She is in her element when surrounded by needy girls with emotional problems, a queen bee with an audience for her theatrical stunts. The central psychological focus of the film is how Susanna is drawn to Lisa and how she realizes that Lisa's power is imaginary and she can do better than her.<br/><br/>The film is also a cool portrait of the 60's: the institution is hopelessly antiquated in its methods and the boyfriend is drafted for Vietnam."

","Girl, Interrupted goes down as one of my all time favourite films, its just perfect. I watched it by chance on a movie channel and was completely captivated, the story line is amazing and the acting is just beyond belief. Angelina Jolie plays a sociopath almost too well I'd say, and Winona Ryder is... a breath of fresh air. The scene when they go to Daisy's (Murphy) house and Lisa (Jolie) confronts her about her father makes me cry buckets, and I don't cry at films easily, and when Susanna (Ryder)is walking up the stairs and you know Daisy is dead, its just incredible and it actually hurts your heart. I also admire the smaller roles in it such as Georgina or Valerie, the cast is enchanting. The ending was beautiful and apt, and I love that the taxi driver is the same guy that took her in! Susanna was never 'crazy' and some people argue whether she should of gone into the institution or not. She obviously did, she wasn't insane, she just needed a wake-up call and to help her grow up and deal with her emotional issues. I love this film! 10/10 - Perfection in a movie."

","The trip to the café. Lisa was told that she would never be allowed out again and now I interpret that as a factual statement, maybe literal. A brick in the wall of an Edgar A Poe bricking in. Would Lisa also receive other chains that would be near impossible to break? If so they would not help her to be more sensible and politic, they would make such to be even more difficult for her. <br/><br/>Her time off the ward after she drugged a nurse. She mentioned Etc and was on the run, to the sunny US retirement state, dreaming Disneyland professional Cinderella. I assume that she had just received further chains, of the permanent sort. Again, I do not think that they would help her towards a healthy approach. This escape had her robbing someone by way of fake prostitution, then conning an enemy to let her stay the night, which led to a suicide, ham fistedly crushing while also misunderstanding the truth? As she had been crushed by people who missed the point about her? The escape failed. <br/><br/>I accept that this is fiction. I assume that the book will show Lisa getting additional chains in different ways. I like the film as it allows glimpses of a sympathetic view of Lisa to be found. If the hidden chainings were visible they might stand out as unreasonable and retrograde, instead it sounds unreasonable to say that they are there. <br/><br/>Susanna did meet the real Lisa on the outside, after they had both been discharged. How deeply buried and chained was that Lisa? The real Susanna looks to be still chained. Hurt. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>When Susanna returned she became immersed in diary writing as a central therapeutic activity. She also received an unusually large amount of help and supervision from the most qualified person there. <br/><br/>After her diary was stolen she did not have a clue re facing the questions of ethics and values that Lisa and the others set her. They were messed up in various ways by the diary, she was sunk by their reactions. <br/><br/>The fictional Harriet of Harriet The Spy 1996 faced a parallel challenge and H did even worst. <br/><br/>When Susanna left she tried to appease Georgina  Clea, yet the way she did it was smelly. She showed that she still did not have a good understanding of the utility and ethics of journal therapy. She was reacting to the criticism in a way that said poor or chained understanding leading to poor mental health. Chained understanding? <br/><br/>Mid teens I was inspired to want to write ""think things through"" notes. My ethics made me freeze instead. Hedgehog Ostrich, drifter. Susanna and Georgina froze at different stages. Lisa? <br/><br/>I do not know how Susanna's book shows this aspect, but I would be surprised if it was not a real problem. <br/><br/>I assume that the note making allowed Susanna a potential for examining her belief system disorders, my private language, even allowing scope for some change of her ways. Her past would have given her massive belief system disorders that I assume I would be able to relate to, I do want to read the book sometime. <br/><br/>As well as the notes she needs more tools, even practical permissions to examine and modify her childhood understandings of appropriate good sense. She shows me that she had a shortfall in her toolkit, that the supervision had needed to help her get that more okay. At least she could have done worse. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Madonna. The 2001 video for What It Feels Like For A Girl. <br/><br/>In the UK there is the possibility for transgendered with the right medical references to gain the legal rights and responsibilities of our acquired gender. I really had not considered it worthwhile for me to try to gather the appropriate references, as if basic civil rights was likely too expensive. Expensive in all sorts of ways. Health professionals have a much more advanced toolkit, in some ways, than a singer. Not that this Madonna is lacking. <br/><br/>What we have in the UK is gender recognition for those who can face the hurdles. What one really needs might include acceptance and tolerance. Lisa and Susanna raise nice questions. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>A story of personal relevance, but reading all the comments none covered what this is to me. <br/><br/>Drafting a comment was not easy. I needed to simplify by just considering a few issues related to Susanna and Lisa, then a look at a parallel issue. This also links with my previous comments on Matilda 1996, 10-10-06, and Goblet Of Fire 2005, 7-9-06, and Fire On The Amazon 1991, 24-5-06, but they are as long as this. Things like the 'Can You Wag The Dog' aspects are hinted at there. <br/><br/>I misuse the term spoiler.

","I wouldn't say that this is the best film ever made... in fact, that is probably far from true; however, I will say that the subject matter is riveting and makes this film great. The reality of what it is like to live in a mental institution hit a definite chord with me. Normally, I don't talk much about myself on these reviews, but for this one, I will go out a limb. I have been a ""Girl, Interrupted"" so to speak, and Ryder's performance as Susanna rings true throughout the entire movie. Jolie's performance as Lisa is also reflects truth as there really are people who captivate everyone in a ward like she portrayed. Murphy's portrayal of Daisy is one of her better roles in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you ever wondered what it was like to be an asylum, or if you just want to see a true to life story that shines a bright light on an emotionally charged environment, I would highly recommend this one."

","This is a fine film. Entertaining, well-acted, but not flawless. It tries a bit too hard to be an Oscar contender when in all actuality it's not high-caliber material. Its 7.0/10 average on IMDb is closer to the score I'd give it than some of the critics who seemed to praise it when it came out. And although Angelina Jolie gives her best performance, it's still not Oscar-quality, and it's always going to be hard to buy an insane mental patient with huge fake lips and breasts. But oh well, that's Hollywood.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder fits the part well. She's always given off dark vibes in all her films, ranging from ""Beetlejuice"" to ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and gives the impression that she's fascinated by death. So, a bit of wise casting there. I am not by any means a fan of Ryder's work (even here she is grating), but at least in ""Girl, Interrupted,"" that's sort of the point.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie if you're looking for entertainment (based on) a true story.

","Not having had any mental issues myself nor having had a close relationship with anyone suffering such issues, I can't speak for how realistic a presentation of such this movie is. I can, being a teenager and having had a few good friends who are also teenagers, confirm that many of us do think about suicide every now and again. I think this movie was a good idea. It's good that there are movies that can show people how mental issues are, and how it is to spend time at a hospital, supposedly being treated for them. Now, I still can't verify the level of truth involved in the story in this film, but as far as I understand, it's based on a book, and I've been told that it's a fairly good adaption, too. The plot is good, it moves back and forth between different situations and times, especially in the beginning, and I think this was a pretty good way to show how you see the world if you have a mental sickness, and, as far as I know, that's a very precise way to depict it. The acting is great, each of the cast members do a good, convincing job of portraying their respective characters. The characters are well-written, credible and real. They are all sufficiently different both in behavior and in which mental illness they suffer. A pretty good drama, that will most likely appeal to any teenager who's ever thought about or seriously considered suicide. I recommend this to fans of dramas, people who the subject appeals to, either on a personal or professional level, and every single teenager out there who feels they are alone in feeling bad. I can imagine that it will affect them greatly. 7/10"
"msultan","Null","1","2","3 June 2004"," not sure...
","*some spoilers*<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to make of this movie.  It reminded me way too much of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, where Angelina Jolie basically takes on Jack Nicholson's role.  So that did not really impress me (I think very highly of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and this was very pale in comparison). On the other hand, I really don't think she deserved an Oscar for her performance.  It seems though that nowadays in order to get an Oscar, women have to either play roles if hysterical women (Halle Berry), bullies (Catherine Zeta-Jones), or a combination of both (Angelina Jolie).  I don't think any of these performances were worthy of an Oscar.  I don't necessarily think that Winona Ryder should have gotten it either for this movie, but I do think that her role was somewhat harder to play than Jolie's, whose character was moreover quite inconsistent, especially at the end when she basically melts away like the Wicked Witch of the West.  I thought that was out of place and unimpressive.<br/><br/>I really liked the effects at the beginning of the movie, when Susanna goes from the past back into the present. The editing of these scenes was pretty impressive.  It usually was prompted by someone's voice and Susanna looked away and found herself in the present. But that stopped after the first night check, and it turns out that these were just memories, not visions. Overall the acting was good, and so was the movie, but I was expecting more. More originality, better performance from Angelina Jolie, more feelings, etc."

","The first hour or so of Girl, Interrupted is watchable, if more than a little flawed, but by the end it self-implodes quite spectacularly into an obvious and over sentimental end. It's major problem is that all the main characters are self obsessed rich girls. Very few of them seem to have any real mental illnesses, especially Winona Ryder's character. This would be acceptable if the movie showed that the doctors diagnosis was nothing more than psychobabble, but it doesn't. In fact, by the end of the movie, Ryder is 'cured' of a disease that she never even seemed to possess.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie's character is portrayed as the bad girl, although she's clearly the only one there who has any acceptance of the situation she's in. And at the end, all it takes is a few well chosen words from Winona Ryder to break down the defenses she's supposed to have built up over a lifetime, and she realises the error of her ways. And Ryder's own ending is just as sloppy - a nice, happy, farewell. All of this is at first set against a backdrop of the Vietnam War, which promises to show the contrast between those being drafted to fight and the pitiful, selfish girls in the mental hospital. But that suddenly gets dropped halfway through, and the war is hardly mentioned again. It's a shame that the story itself is so ideologically contemptible because the film looks nice and the acting is superb, but that's just the way it goes sometimes."

","I had been waiting anxiously for this to  be released in Britain and then finally last week it was released and I got to see the finished product. Having read the book almost 6 months before watching the film, I had some idea of what to expect. Winona Ryder was already my fave actress a long time before this movie but watching this has only made me respect and admire her work even more. The film starts off great - with Winonas voice doing the narrative bit and her words really hit home. I myself have suffered from mental problems and so I could really relate to what she was saying. It is a little frustrating at times - I didnt like the way it kept showing you flashbacks and at times it got a bit confusing, but that only added to the overall feeling of the film. Clea Duvall is amazing as pathological liar Georgina, Brittany Murphy sensational as the chicken loving Daisy and Elizabeth Murphy wonderful as the little girl in so much distress that she set herself on fire. Even the small roles of MG and janet are played amazingly. However it is of course Winona and Angelina who steal the show as mad bad sociopath Lisa and vulnerable nervous little susanna. Angelina is truly fantastic and does indeed deserve all the recognition she is getting for her role. I was soooo pleased to see her win the oscar and she is an amazing actress and steals the show in every film I have ever seen her in, but I cant help but think that she has kind of stolen Winonas thunder slightly. The film is, primarily about Sussann - Winonas character and Winona does a great job. Her role does not have the edge that Angelinas has, but Winona plays her role just perfectly. Her facial expressions tell you so much - you know what shes thinking before shes even said it because of them and the bit where she has a go at Whoopis character was fantastic!!! I read where Winona has said that if you dont like her then you wont like the film , because most of the time the camera is just on her face, and I agree with that. I think anyone who doesnt like this film doesnt like Winona and thats the only reason why they dont like the film. It has some fantastic bits - my fave being where susanna and lisa sing Downtown to Polly - it was so sweet! and near the end when Sussanna paints Lisas finger nails. My only complaint is that there were bits in the film that were differant to the book and some bits in the film you wouldnt really understand unless you read the book. So for anyone who hasnt read the book - I would do so immediately. Of course although all the actresses were amazing and gave the perfomances of their lives there is one person whom people seem to be forgetting about completely - SUSSANNA KAYSEN. That woman is so emensly brave to have wrote her story and let it be made into a film for the world to see. Thanks to Sussanna Kaysen people are finally accepting mental illness for what it is - an illness and thanks to Winona this film got made because if she hadnt pushed for it to have been made it would never have happened. All the actresses in the film are going to go on to great things I know and I hope that Winona will continue to make such wonderful movies. Just one last thing .......Why on earth did she not get nominated as best actress for her role? A crime has most surely been committed there. Anyway along with SET IT OFF - this has to be my fave movie of all times. After all I am going to see it again tomorrow for the 5th time!!!!!"

Still, excellent performances from Jolie (who really DOES deserve this Oscar), Duvall and others. Ryder was good, but since I quite strongly disliked her character towards the end I think that is affecting my judgement. A definite must-see for anyone who's ever had doubts about their sanity, or anyone who wants to understand what it is to be a little crazy. I especially liked the accurate portrayals of the so-called disorders : Lisa is a true sociopath, Georgina's pathological lying is very accurate and the others are also truly portrayed, right down to Suzanna herself - borderline is ethereal at best and this is again accurately brought across.

","The problem with ""Girl, Interrupted"" is that the main character Susanna (Winona Ryder) is rather boring. Actually, there are only two really interesting characters in the film: Angelina Jolie's sociopath and the girl played by Brittany Murphy. But even though Susanna is pretty boring, the film isn't. I think it's a rather interesting and entertaining film. Of course, it's too long (over two hours) and in the beginning it's too episodic, but overall I think it's an okay film. And brilliant acting by Ryder, Jolie (in particular) and Murphy, of course. (5/10)"

","I'm sorry you can't make a movie this close to another movie and not have them compared. I first want to say that this is a pretty good movie. However, it has major flaws and just for being so similar to such a classic and beloved movie it has to be extra good in all areas...and it's not.<br/><br/>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is better for the following reasons: Jack Nicholson in his prime. (There is nothing better than Jack back when he cared about acting) Milos Forman-superior director. Manigold- heavy handed. More dramatic story. Violent loser gets thrown in Asylum. Triumph of the spirit? Girl Interrupted- Lazy upperclass girl gets pushed into a tame mental health resort. Triumph of psychotherapy?<br/><br/>So basically it is of course a lesser movie. Watch Cuckoo's Nest again and you'll see why.<br/><br/>Angelie Jolie is good but you don't like her. If that was the point then fine. However, I also didn't like Whine-ona Ryder. So who is left to like? I gotta like someone. Cause why watch a movie about unlikeable people. I liked the Cabbie. I like some of the other resort guests. Whoopie Goldberg was kinda good. Soooooooo. Not enough. Too much lazy girl angst.<br/><br/>Still a pretty good movie."

Funny at points, dramatic (maybe too dramatic) and poignant, this film is good, but don't expect a Cukoo's nest. Why?  Because the main character Susanna (Ryder) doesn't hole the same embodyment and character that Jack Nicholson did.  Still, it isn't as bad a some people might make you think.

","Girl, Interrupted is a biographical drama starring Oscar Nominee Winona Ryder as writer Susanna Kaysen and Angelina Jolie from Playing by Heart and Gia. It was written and directed by James Mangold, director of Heavy, and based on Kaysen's autobiography. I loved this film. Both Ryder and Jolie (especially Jolie) give amazing performances, both impressing me greatly because I've never seen such powerful performances from either of them.<br/><br/>Mangold shows us that you don't have to make a graphic film in order for it to still be intense. He shows us that a film can be made intense with just powerful acting and a powerful script that takes no prisoners. He geniusly does this throughout the whole film. Jolie is perfectly cast as Lisa, another woman in Susanna's ward. In the climax of the film (which I won't ruin) Jolie displays what acting is about when she finally confronts Susanna about her problems.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's an amazingly acted and directed film. I highly recommend this movie but remember that it's not for everyone so don't yell at me when you see it and dislike it.

"short_skitlet","10","1","3","20 October 2005"," Tap into the Psychological
","This so happens to be my favorite movie. The acting is remarkable. Angelina Jolie is definitely worthwhile, and Oscar worthy. <br/><br/>As far as technical film processes go, this is an excellent film. Even if you hate the film's story, you have to give it credit for it's acting and directing. James Mangold is highly underrated, and props to Winona Ryder for finding him. I doubt anyone could have made a better piece of art. The transitions between scenes where Susanna fades between reality and something else is remarkable and clever. There are many scenes in which Winona and Angelina have absolute chemistry. I know that this word is usually used in romantic situations in film, but here it is used because you can feel the relationship that Susanna and Lisa have. And there are three distinct relationships the two have as the movie goes on: fascination, admiration, and hatred. With every scene that the two are in together you get chills in the way they react (and it's not just because Angelina does such a remarkable job as someone who is terrifying). Not to discredit Winona's job. In the director's cut James Mangold talks about Winona being a ""silent actress."" This is very present in this film. She is so powerful even when she is not talking. Her facial expressions are so in tune and seem to put the view right inside her head. But although these two dominate the movie, and are very good, other actresses should be acknowledged too. Brittany Murphy is very impressive as well as Whoppi (as always).<br/><br/>What seems, to me, though, to be most critical in wondering whether to pick this one up at Blockbuster or not is this: if the mentally ill scare you, this film will probably weird you out and you won't like it at all. What is most important about this film is it's relatablility. One can easily relate to the Winona Ryder character, especially if your teenage years were full of angst and indecisiveness. People who, remarkably, believe they have a grasp of life, and understand it in full will not want to see this movie, because they will get frustrated with how deep Susanna involves herself in pointless matters. I, on the other hand, and those who like this film, will find that Susanna is looking for the answers to questions we face everyday. <br/><br/>That having been said (I assume all those who don't want to involve themselves in a psychological downer have stopped reading), I can move on to discuss the wide variety of philosophical questions this movie delves into. I know a lot of teenage girls relate with Susanna. This character, for them, IS them. And the questions Susanna asks throughout the movie (Am I really crazy?, What is it to be normal?) are ones those girls ask continually. Who am I? is a question people have to either spend lots of time trying to answer, deny that it exists, or leave it alone. This film is to help focus on what it really is to be sane, human, and undeniably something. <br/><br/>There is a line in which Whoppi Goldberg says, ""You are not crazy! You're a lazy, self- indulgent, little girl who is driving herself crazy!"" Anyone who knows what this statement means will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>I feel there does need to be a paragraph dedicated to Angelina Jolie's performance. Although she is an idol because of her beauty and the tabloids love her, Angelina does not get enough credit for her acting. I don't believe for a second that any other actress in Hollywood could pull off such a performance. Angelina really becomes Lisa, and is very scary, yet likable in this regard. She has been compared to Jack Nicholson, with very good reason. There is not another female counterpart that could have pulled such a profound display. Every scene she is in you know of her presence, and her body movement, eye contact, facial expressions, voice influxtions everything are so precise and perfect that one cannot help but give her performance an A+."
"blakeleya1","5","1","3","26 December 2004"," All who attempt to compare this film to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest please respond now
","Upon just having watched the film, Girl, Interrupted, I was not expecting anything great and thus was surprised at what I was given. So far of what I have seen in regard to films with Angelina Jolie, Whoopie Goldberg, Winona Ryder, and Brittany Murphy, who are the four actresses I found to be the most impressive, the roles they inhabited in this film were singularly sublime. When I think of these women, having not had the privilege of meeting them, and only their movies from which to observe them, I feel that their own personalities and characters are uncannily suited to the women they portray in the film itself. The casting director alone should be applauded for his or her efforts in assembling such an extraordinary group. In always choosing to keep my comments short and brief I will finish with a few points of good and bad commentary because those portions I found to be the most highlighting will give you, the viewer, an uncompromising outlook. The film, from what I could envision after having it ruminate in my mind for only a day, seemed to try to empower women, not through extreme political opposition or supposed enlightened ideologies, but through living out their lives as normal individuals. Goldberg's aggressive expression of psychology in a humanitarian wrapper as she responds to Ryder's character's pampered pouting after Lisa (Jolie) leaves the institution and Ryder is dropped into the bathtub, is the climactic turning point for this movie's righteous success, and a non-threatening addition to this movie's estrogen-charged atmosphere. Anyone who thinks this movie resembles One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest needs to have their eyes and ears checked because besides the fact that a majority of the story takes place in a mental institution it is absolutely and completely different in every imaginable aspect. I am just venting a little at this point, sorry if it is distracting in any way. If anyone tries to format any sort of a linear comparison of these two films, I will be forced to respond harshly to your criticisms with a command of my own. In terms of stars, 4 being the highest and none being the lowest, I give this film 3 stars."

","This is the most fantastic movie I have ever seen, it is my absolute favorite movie of all time.  Angelina Jolie is truly the annointed one, and Ryder is incredible. <br/><br/>The movie starts out where Susanna Kaysen(Winona Ryder) tries to commit suicide by chasing a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka.  She denies this was a suicide attempt(""I had a headache!"").  She is sent to Claymoore, where she quickly befriends Lisa Rowe.  Lisa is a sociopath.<br/><br/>Anyway, Polly ""Torch"" Clark has a freak out, because she just realized that she was ugly because she had set fire to herself years before.  She throws a fit, and Lisa and Susanna stay up singing to her- but not before drugging the nurse on guard.<br/><br/>They get in serious trouble for this- Lisa is put in another ward, and Susanna pouts.  Lisa comes back, and tells Susanna to come back to Florida with her, so that Lisa can become the new Cinderella(""f I could have any job in the world I'd be a professional Cinderella."") and so that Susanna can be Snow White. <br/><br/>They crash for the night at Daisy Randone's new apartment.  Daisy Randone is a victim of sexual abuse by her own father.  While Susanna and Lisa stay at Daisy's apartment, Lisa mocks Daisy by saying hurtful(Yet very truthful) things(""They didn't release you because you're better, Daisy... they just gave up.  You call this a life?  Hmm?  Taking daddy's money!  Buying your dollies and your knick-knacks!  And eating his f*cking chicken, fattening up like a prize f*cking heifer... you changed the scenery, but not the f*cking situation, and the warden makes housecalls.  And everybody knows, EVERYBODY knows... that he f*cks you.  What they don't know... is that you like it. You... like it."").  Susanna takes a walk the next morning, and comes back to Daisy's house only to find that she killed herself.<br/><br/>She calls the ambulance, and Lisa takes off.  Susanna takes this time to write in her journal, and she gets better, except when Lisa is caught and brought back to the ward.  Susanna tells Lisa that they are about to discharge her.  The night before Susanna leaves, Lisa snatches her journal, and reads hurtful comments that Susanna wrote about everyone aloud. Georgina Tuskin, who is a pathological liar, got angry and said to Susanna, ""You'd better erase it, Susanna, you'd better erase it!  Because my father is head of the C.I.A. and could have you dead in MINUTES!!!!""<br/><br/>Susanna asks Lisa why she is doing this, and Lisa gives her reasons. Susanna tells Lisa that the reason why nobody wished that she was dead was because she's dead already, her heart is cold.  What does she expect?  She's a sociopath.  But anyway, before Susanna leaves, they both make amends, and they are friends again.  <br/><br/>All in all, it is the most wonderful movie of all time, and a lot of the scenes made me cry. 10 out of 10"

"jchong","10","1","3","22 December 1999"," Fine performances mark a fine film.
","Well, I just saw ""Girl, Interrupted"" with a friend of mine in west Los Angeles in a theater full of college to middle-aged women. Honestly, folks, this is Winona Ryder's best performance to date, although it might not be immediately obvious because of the tremendous subtlety in her acting. Sure, Angelina Jolie is electrifying, but in obvious ways since her role was clearly the flashier of the two. Despite rumors that they didn't get along too well during the shoot, Ryder and Jolie work very well together onscreen, and the supporting cast is stellar, particularly Clea DuVall (Georgina) and Brittany Murphy (Daisy). There are a few scenes in this movie that present some of Ryder's very best acting of all of her films.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold (Heavy, Cop Land) did a fine job avoiding cheap sentimentality, and I was impressed with his fluid adaptation of a very disjointed and unconventional narrative work. My one complaint is that the film wasn't as gritty or as emotionally resonant as I would have liked, so I walked out of the theater feeling more impressed with the performances than impacted by the story. Still, for any Winona Ryder fan, this movie--with its 2 hours full of close-ups of Ryder's hauntingly beautiful face--is an absolute dream. Multiple layers of muted anguish are registered in Ryder's expressive eyes, and her most powerful acting in this film comes out through her subtle facial expressions rather than any spoken words. ""Girl, Interrupted"" is not a disappointment by any means. If anything, it has strengthened my respect for Winona Ryder as an actor."
"Blondie_","Null","1","3","29 October 2001"," I was disappointed
","I read all the critical acclaim that this film has received and was ulitmately disappointed upon seeing it. The main thing that bothered me was that the script, storyline situations, and dialogue were all very cliched, hokey, and predictable. I felt as if I was watching an ""ABC Afterschool Special"" with profanity added to it. Some of this dialogue made me laugh, it was so hokey! I also don't understand the character that Angelina Jolie played. Here she was supposed to be a sociopath and was successfully portrayed as such until the end of the movie. Then all of a sudden she is a crying mess because the others have hurt her feelings? Huh? Sociopaths don't feel psychological hurt or pain! And I also think Jolie's performance is overrated. Chloe Sevingy did so much better in her film and should of won the Oscar. It must be so nice and convenient to have a bloodline that pretty much guarantees you important awards. The only thing I liked about this movie was the acting. It was superb, every single actress just gave a dynamic peformance. I especially like Brittany Murphy. Even she did better than Jolie. Other than that, this movie blew!"

"chas437","5","1","5","14 May 2019"," Should Have Been So Much Better
","The source material, Susanna Kaysen's memoirs are compelling material, but it was quite poorly adapted. The screenplay becomes bogged down by unnecessary cinematic gimmicks and tacked on scenes which are superfluous to the basic story.<br/><br/>As much as Jolie's performance was praised by fans and critics, it was overblown. There is too much of the Lisa character in the film such that it detracted from Susanna's journey. Lisa's continual escapades and escapes are simply not believable. Why would an institution who's mission is to help these troubled young women continually let Lisa prey on the other patients? How does she escape from padded cells over and over again?<br/><br/>
Its gutless filmmaking. The final scene, on the night before Susanna's release is completely unneeded. Its reminds one of the tacked on final scenes in action/adventure movies where the supposedly dead monster has one last gasp. Its a cheap gimmick.<br/><br/>
Its a shame for Winona Ryder, who had loved the project for years. She was instrumental in seeing this film made. WInona's nuanced performance is bulldozed by an over exposed Jolie. Even Susanna Kaysen was a detractor of the film. This should have been Ryder's Oscar, but they screwed it up."
"velvets203","6","1","6","12 January 2005"," Why o Why must you change the book?
","I read the book before seeing the movie, and was disappointed with the cinematic version. Winona Ryder's character in real life was much less attractive, which added to many a person not feeling her pain as directly as they should have. My biggest problem with the movie is that they find the diary. This does NOT happen in the book, and I truly have no idea why they decided to add that to an already fine story. Did we really need the ""emotional climax"" of them finding out what Susanna had to say about the each of them? I don't know why they needed to embarrass Susanna into realizing that she had problems too. Of course she had her own problems, she is in the institution with them. Jolie's character is more defined as truly insane in the book, which allows Susanna to realize that she in NOT insane, since Lisa (Jolie) is. I hate to be the elitist crying foul when a book is changed, since almost no movie (LOTR excluded) does NOT change something in the theatrical version. But this book is a quick, fun read, and I suggest anyone who liked the movie to find a time to read it. Overall, with fine performances by the actresses (Britney Murphy earns some stripes here), this movie is a pleasure to watch if you are into the mental psyche of people. Nothing too disturbing here, so if you are a fan of the actresses and/or want to see an Oscar winning performance, by all means give this movie a shot. Book changing screenplay for no reason lowers my vote from 7 to 6."

"RossRivero99","10","0","2","8 March 2017"," One of James Mangold's finest films
","James Mangold's ""Girl, Interrupted"" is the best film that I have seen about disabled people since ""Rain Man"" (1988) but the key difference between those two films is that this movie is based on true events. The movie stars Winona Ryder as Susanna Kaysen who wrote the book that this movie was adapted from and it talks about her time and experience in a mental hospital in the 1960's but at first it isn't that easy for her to make many friends. During her first few days the only person she really trusts is the supervising nurse named Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg) whose job is very difficult and Goldberg's character is the polar opposite of Nurse Ratched who was played by Louise Fletcher in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975). As her time in the hospital progresses Susanna meets a girl named Georgina (Clea Duvall), and then meets a girl who everyone really gets annoyed with and despises at times is a girl named Lisa (Angelina Jolie) who has a really bad attitude. Then in one scene we see Kaysen's boyfriend named Tobias Jacobs (Jared Leto) who is trying to sneak Susanna out of the hospital but Susanna refuses. Other friends that Susanna happens to make are girls named Daisy (Brittany Murphy), Polly (Elisabeth Moss) and others. The reason why Susanna Kaysen was sent to the hospital in the first place was because she was very suicidal which she was sent there by a psychiatrist named Dr. Potts (Jeffrey Tambor). The other doctor in the mental hospital has a very weird last name and her name is Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave), the movie has an excellent cast and great performances throughout which are so good because it really makes you empathize with each and every one of the characters and we feel like we are actually there getting to know them. As the great Roger Ebert once said that ""For me the movies are a machine that generates empathy, it helps to understand hopes, dreams, aspirations and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us."" and that is exactly how I felt with this and many other movies. Despite this movie being one of the best films of 1999 it isn't the very best movie that James Mangold ever directed (that would be ""Walk the Line"" (2005) which also happened to be a biopic). James Mangold has done a very good by making this movie just focus on the characters and their feelings instead of just shedding a bad light on them as people even though we know their problems are bad just like Barry Levinson did with ""Rain Man"" 11 years before this movie was made. This was a truly great movie but as a warning it might only be worth watching once."

Angelina provides a performance that may surpass Winona's. However, both characters really embrace their characters and their ""crazy"" personalities. <br/><br/>This movie shows truth about mental illness and how mental illness was perceived in the 60's. The insight into human flaws, mental illness, and profound social problems is amazing.

Not only when I was young, but until now when I have reached maturity. It's like being illuminated of the mind of people with mental illness. I can see their daily lives and how they interact with each other, and with normal people. But watching this movie, honestly I am a little bit confounded by the definition of normal and crazy people. It's seems superficial. Self-control is the key, I guess.<br/><br/>I really all the casts in this movie, particularly Angelina Jolie. Her role is another version of Gia with a bolder and fearless personality, and a little touch of hidden vulnerability. Amazing. I don't know how she does those incredible actings. Winona Ryder also does a good job. I can see how confuse she is with her life. And she really looks like the real young Susanna Kaysen. This role is really perfect for her. <br/><br/>Oh, in the opening, Sussana narrates this line: ""Or stolen something when you have the cash."" You know, it really brought back the memory of what has been done by Winona. No offense to Winona, but it just occurred to me. I couldn't resist it."

","I swear, this film would make you extremely angry, the doctors back then hadn't a clue on how they dealt with diagnosing an individual with mental illness. Not just the doctors but the parents, the priests and the therapists were all the same! They honestly were a disgrace for putting their loved ones in a Nuthouse just because they are in need of help. I mean everybody has problems, why on earth did they just stupidly diss this? It's like a lie where no one has problems but in fact 100% of us do! I'm glad all the asylums have closed up but there's still scars of the past for those poor people.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie, Brittany Murphy (RIP), Winona Ryder, Clea DuVall and many others involved in this film did a fantastic job on their roles!

","Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) ODs on aspirins and family friend Dr. Crumble convinces her to go to Claymoore Hospital. She's struggling to find herself as a writer and had a fling with her parents' married colleague. She's the only one in her '67 class not to go to college. She insists that she's didn't attempt suicide. Her roommate Georgina Tuskin (Clea DuVall) is a compulsive liar. Sweet Torch Clark (Elisabeth Moss) has burns on her face. Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) has food and daddy issues. The police returns escapee Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie) who is a whirlwind rebellious personality. Soon, Susanna realizes that this is not simply for a short rest. Her boyfriend Tobias Jacobs (Jared Leto) gets drafted. Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg) is the wise nurse in charge. Dr. Melvin Potts (Jeffrey Tambor) declares Susanna has borderline personality disorder. Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave) takes over her case with some big insights.<br/><br/>Nurse Valerie calls Susanna ""a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who is driving herself crazy."" I disagree on the lazy part because she's trying very hard. However, much of the movie feels indulgent to me. Valerie tells Susanna that she's not really sick. The big surprise of the movie is that the mental hospital and its staff are not evil. They are mostly reasonable. Potts comes off a little clueless but Susanna is really just rebelling against her uptight parents and fighting against herself. That's not to say that this is an useless exercise. There are some good performances from the actresses. There is one great section with Ryder watching Jolie throw verbal bombs at Murphy. To me, that's the most impressive section of the movie. The final confrontation is a bit melodramatic. The movie should have wrapped up soon after the Jolie Murphy confrontations."

","""Take the life-lie away from the average man and you take away his life."" - Henrik Ibsen <br/><br/>1967. 18 year old Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) checks herself into a Mental Hospital after attempting suicide. She is diagnosed with the vaguely titled ""Borderline Personality Disorder"", a self destructive ""illness"" which seems to spring from a complex cocktail of alienation, existential malaise, intelligence, despair, depression, misanthropy and a hyper-sensitive nervous system. Unlike average people, who hold cognitive biases in at least three key areas - viewing oneself in unrealistically positive terms, believing one has more control over their environment than they actually do, holding views about the future that are more positive than evidence can justify – Susanna's self-esteem is shattered because she is unwilling to entertain certain consoling delusions.<br/><br/>At the Hospital Susanna meets Lisa Rowe (Angelina Jolie), an uncaring sociopath with a ""cold heart"". Lisa believes she will ""end up"" as a ""cold hearted sociopath"" if she continues to view the world as she does. Lisa thus redefines her depression as a form of self-absorption, narcissism and self-indulgence, identifies herself as ""the cause of her problem"", exits the Hospital, decides to ""be happy"", ""chooses life"" and then learns to write ""all her bad feelings and observations in a book"". She then becomes a writer. The film was based on the memoirs of author Susanna Kaysen. It's narrative arc is a rights-of-passage many artists or creative types go through. It's what Saint John called a ""Dark Night of the Soul"" or what Satre termed ""existential nausea"".<br/><br/>Though one of the best ""big budget suicide movies"", ""Girl, Interrupted"" ultimately trivialise mental illness and continues a Hollywood trend (see ""Veronica Decides To Die"" et al) of placing the blame of ""mental illnesses"" solely on the individual. In such films, it is always the individual's duty to ""adapt to"" or ""block out"" problems. Individuals and society are dichotomized, and the environmental/socioeconomic/cultural/existential milieu in which the subject exists is ignored such that ""suicide"" is reduced to a kind of biochemical glitch or issue of personal will power. <br/><br/>In reality, though, there is no separation between the individual and society. Human beings become social with the appropriation of language, and it is language that constitutes us as subjects. ""Madness"" is itself often a kind of discourse, an attempt at communication, and assuming that human beings can ever be 100 percent mentally healthy, self improvement is never possible without first calling a toxic society into question.<br/><br/>Today, most mental disorders are still classified on the basis of symptoms because there are as yet no biological markers or tests for them. This is not to say that some mental illnesses aren't caused by genetic or biological ""defects"", but that what often passes for mental illness is itself just a symptom of a larger social problem. Medicating the subject is often a form of denial or aversion, and simply results in further problems down the line. The mental health profession has also somehow missed out on various ""perspectives"" prevalent now in philosophy, history, the social sciences, literature and art. Like the Church, it is in the business of forcing very specific ""realities"" onto people. Label someone crazy – rationally speaking, Susanna is not wrong – and the subject suddenly is both crazy, and self-reinforces this craziness. Today psychiatry, a multi trillion dollar industry, is responsible for nearly 90 percent of all health care fraud in the United States.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie won an Academy Award for her performance. Like most Award winners, it's mostly a loud, flashy performance. Winona Ryder, always adorable, does better work here, conveying both fragility and a sense of resultant, overcompensated toughness. The film's title is genius: ""mental illness"" halts life hard and fast, and often life only seems to re-start once the subject has conquered its demons. Such ""conquerings"" often take the form of elaborate, psychological con-jobs. We see that here, Sussana ""believing"" herself to be cured but then seeking out a profession that allows her to maintain physical and psychic distance from that which ills her.<br/><br/>8/10 – Too Hollywood, too superficial, too playful (the hospital feels too much like a fun sorority), but Ryder endears with her frail frame and big Bambi eyes. See ""Red Desert"", ""Titticut Follies"", ""The Devil Probably"", Julian Hendry's ""Why Did You Kill My Dad?"" and ""The Magdalene Sisters"". Worth one viewing."
"antonjsw1","10","0","1","15 August 2011"," A thoughtful, touching and excellent film
","A steadily paced but utterly absorbing story about a troubled 18 year Susanna Kaysen, subtlety played by Winona Ryder, whose experience at a psychiatric hospital l in the 1967 makes a real impression. While Ryder was also a producer on the film and worked very hard to get the film made, it plays as an involving ensemble piece with lot of actors getting a chance to shine, most notably Whoopi Goldberg as Nurse Valerie Owens, the late Brittany Murphy as the abused Daisy Randone and Angelina Jolie as sociopathic long time patient Lisa Rowe, for which she won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>The film, while working from a strong script by Lisa Loomer, Anna Hamilton Phelan and director James Mangold, uses the experiences of the real-life Susanna Kaysen (who was also a producer on the film) from her novel. This film deals with the issue of mental health, and Mangold makes a brave decision to try and make the film as accessible as possible for a mainstream audience. While some critics have claimed that the film is overtly sanitised, it is very unlikely that a more gritty approach would led to the film being green lit on a $25-30 million budget.<br/><br/>Performances are all understated but very real, with the notable exception of Jolie's character, who is very confrontational and direct. Kudos must go to all the cast including Goldberg, Murphy, DuVall, Moss, Tambor, and very effective cameos from Kurtwood Smith and Vanessa Redgrave. This is the real achievement of the film. The characters remain grounded and real within the context of the story, and the performers, under the expert and thoughtful guidance of director James Mangold generate warmth and interest that allows the viewer, providing you are patient (pun not intended), to invest in, and care for the characters. Jolie turns in a very charismatic and intense performance, and is one her best performances in my opinion, up there with her performance in Beyond Borders and the Changeling. However, Ryder is the ultimate anchor of the film, and in this regard she succeeds magnificently. One of her real strengths is her ability to tell a story non-verbally. At the start of the film, she clearly communicates to the audience her character being a lonely lost soul, who is initially horrified about going to psychiatric hospital, but nevertheless bonds with the fellow patients. Another strength is that Ryder's character begins to move in a direction which implies she is becoming dependant on the hospital, and her character develops rebellious tendencies, clearly inspired by the character's attraction to Jolie's Lisa. The conflict her character goes through with other characters as a result of this relationship works very well and leads to a satisfying and grounded climax that tries very hard to not be too sentimental or stereotypical.<br/><br/>Technical credits are understated but impressive. Mangold's direction is spot on, and he makes clever use of match cuts to transition the story, but also to inform the audience of the lead character's disorientated psychological state. Design, costumes, photography and music are all very effective and contribute to a really polished and well-made film. The film captures the atmosphere of 1967/8 America very well, yet this does not dominate the story, which in many ways feels timeless and totally accessible for a modern audience. <br/><br/>In summary, an excellent achievement that is a sensitive yet accessible film about an individual dealing with difficult but common real life problems."

","It's difficult to judge about films like this. First of all, because if you're child of 90's it's hard to totally feel what life was like in 60's. And then, it's necessary to read the origin-the book and i didn't. But anyway..<br/><br/>This one deals with a lot of questions-social intentions and mental institutions, friendship and loneliness, suicide,absence of emotions and feelings and depression, life and death. It's rather close to me because someday I had feelings close to those that Susanna had. And still I'm not satisfied with the world around just like her. But I have the will to fight!<br/><br/>In my teenage years I thought that this was the story about unhappy, depressed and lonely people belonging to the generation ""we are going nowhere"" who are seeking the way out of it all. Now I realize that they're no more than crazy ones who couldn't deal with their problems themselves. While watching the movie we're trying to identify the strong and the weak ones in the story but actually everyone is weak there. If mental institution becomes your home because you got nowhere to go-this is not your misfortune,it's your fault. The world is s**t and your life totally s***s-yeah, I got the point. But why do you have to go to the clinic to make it better? What for do they show the world their unhappiness? Just to increase their popularity?<br/><br/>The explanation lies beneath-this is the story of the woman and about the women-just like the one in ""Virgin suicides"". That one is much darker because there the girls loved death more than everything. Here they don't love anything at all. The similarity is that in both movies the heroes are absolutely powerless against everything-and that is very,very strange.<br/><br/>It's all only my opinion. Life differs, and people differ too. That is why I kinda enjoyed this one and watched it just to get an experience and to think over all the important things of our life..and death."

","As someone who copes with the emotional disorder that is supposed to be portrayed by the lead role, there was very little in this film to illustrate what it's like to live with the disorder and how it affects interpersonal relationships. It was even difficult to discern exactly what behavior was extreme enough to warrant the level of care the character underwent. I have yet to read the book, but I've been told the original story is a personal account and is quite good at portraying the condition. I haven't read it mainly because I don't want to be disappointed twice. As long as I ignored the premise of the film, I could enjoy the movie for the chemistry between Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, who I thought put forth solid performances. But to me it was simply a fair yarn about two coming-of-age girls -- how one matures and the other doesn't -- with a little bit of extra Hollywood drama thrown in for good measure and to keep it interesting."

"theVHSrocks","10","0","3","21 April 2007"," I feel very guilty about loving this movie: A Subjective Review
","Fine, I admit, despite the fact that I am anti-psychiatry in a way that would even put Tom Cruise to shame, I adore the idea of the mental hospital and related concepts within a fiction realm. Despite the fact I would probably kill myself, if I were committed in real life, if I had a holodeck from Star Trek, you could only guess the scenarios I'd be creating for myself. Okay, so I am biased. Mental Hospitals give me great me pleasures, even when I just think of them. It's something about a person being considered non-accountable and not of sound psyche as well as being worthy of confinement for just their demeanor and attitudes that I think with me really just strikes bunches of chords. <br/><br/>So, upon seeing a movie that did not only meet that but heterosexually fascination of women I immediately sought it out. However, such a non-sexual fetish as this is not something you would want to make public, so I naturally was very discrete in both how I reacted to this film and how I sought it out. I can't watch the movie without yelling at the characters, and I'm always afraid that someone at the library will wonder what a male like me is doing renting a movie like that with the amount of times I do. <br/><br/>So, what is the movie itself? Well, it's a women's late 1960s half melodrama/half ""life passing as we adventure and experience the world"" drama. It's very well-acted but the material is at time's cringe-worthy. What really makes the film is just how effectively it emobdies its setting and attitudes of the characters. As for the former we really feel like we're in a mental hospital. This isn't raving lunatics and great horrors. It's a locked summer camp for sane young adults, who were bought down by the man. This is the type of place I would find myself lying on my couch imagining I was in. In terms of the latter, you could never accuse the film of not developing its characters, because one of the things it does amazingly masterpiece level way is make clear the way that all the characters view their lives and situations. We really understand why they all do what they do and feel what they feel as well why they are in the positions they are in. It's tragic and it sucks you into the story like few other films have by crafting a portrait of people who seem real, for they might as well be real people (whom they were based off) because our understanding of them is great. Even, though I can objectively say that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a better film, the characters don't have anything on this movie. <br/><br/>This film has a lot that goes for it, but then again, it's just eaten up by me. There are so many ingredients for transcendent cinema here, and although I experience that because it is almost like a film made for me, I wouldn't know about that with other people. The thing is I couldn't possibly judge how a normal person would see this film. It's terribly manipulative and the ending is totally untrue. This is what they movies that are favorites but not best ofs. <br/><br/>Actually, when I think of it, if it weren't for that untrue ending and manipulation, this could have been a experience I could truly consider to be great. The vibrancy of the characters had a ridiculous amount going for them, and I could only (and do in my spare time) imagine how great it really could have been had the characters stayed truer to their nature. I really should write a fanfiction."

Anyway, this is true story based on the accounts of Susanna Kaysen (played by Winona Ryder). Basically she has been having delusions and an affair with the husband of her parents' friend, also she was possibly trying to commit suicide with vodka mixed with aspirin. She is short to Claymoore for a short period, and she is obviously uncomfortable with all the crazy, noisy patients around her. But as she settles into the environment she becomes influenced to write talking to nurses and patients, including Valerie Owens, RN (Whoopi Goldberg), pathological liar Georgina Tuskin (Clea DuVall), Daisy Randone (Brittany Murphy) who eats nothing with people around her, badly scarred (by fire) Polly 'Torch' Clark (Elisabeth Moss) and the biggest exasperation for the staff, sociopath Lisa Rowe (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Angelina Jolie, the only Oscar nomination). Lisa has a history of escapes, and they almost become best friends with their shared opinions of staff and the hospital. Also starring Jared Leto as Susanna's boyfriend, Tobias 'Toby' Jacobs, Jeffrey Tambor as Dr. Melvin Potts and Vanessa Redgrave as Dr. Sonia Wick. With good performances from Ryder, Jolie and Goldberg, this might not be as poignant as One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, even being based on truth, but it is a film to be seen.

There are points in the movie that allow the viewer to question his or her own thoughts on issues regarding life.

","***SPOILER ALERT****<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"" is about a young woman who was hospitalized in the 1960's after a suicide attempt. The main character is well-played by Winona Ryder and features an excellent cast, including Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldburg and Brittany Murphy. They give some powerful performances.I found the movie to be funny, charming and entertaining in depicting the relationships of these women in a psychiatric ward. Basically, the story revolves around the young woman's journey back to ""sanity"" after her initial diagnosis of BPD--Borderline Personality Disorder. The best part about this movie is the emphasis on love and friendship that develop between the patients and staff. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie should come with a warning that much of the story is a gross deviation from the true story, the book by the same name ""Girl, Interrupted"", written by the subject of it, Susanna Kaysen which is an account of her hospitalization experience. I've seen many user comments from people who haven't read the book referring to it as the ""true story"" not knowing that many scenes and events never occurred. There are various changes made in certain characters, some big, some small but the most major change is the character, Lisa Rowe, a sociopath (played by Anjelina Jolie). In the movie, she is enigmatic, somewhat cruel, sinister at times and indirectly causes the death of another patient through her cruelty. Eventually, she becomes homicidal and stalks Susanna through the tunnels underneath the hospital with a hypodermic needle loaded with who-knows-what. The thing is, the real-life Lisa never did any of those things which are significant alterations of a character and subsequently the storyline (not to mention slanderous). It bothers me because it reinforces Hollywood stereotypes of mental illness--some things being distorted in order to sensationalize--the butcher-knife wielding mental patient is always more interesting than the real thing to movie-makers. Actually, some of the things that the real Lisa did were more interesting to me, like toilet-papering the TV room and stealing all the light bulbs from the ward (when asked how, she said ""I have a long skinny arm."") <br/><br/>Ultimately, it doesn't reflect the true story by Ms. Kaysen whose book is an endearing, honest, meaningful and insightful look at the real experience of mental illness. I would say that as a **fictional** story for entertainment value, it's a good movie and worth watching but if you want the **truth**, I highly recommend you check out the book from your local library."

","This was actually much better than I expected it to be. Scratch Winona and I'd have given it a 10/10. Since, sadly, she's there and she can't act, it's not a classic in my opinion. Based on the book, ""Girl, Interrupted"", it is the chronicle of Susanna Kaysen's stay in a mental hospital in the late '60's. The issue deep down is healing - how do we heal? How do we get attached to our own illness? How do we change our own view of ourself? Susanna first needs to realize she's sick, to face up to her suicide attempt as not simply 'trying to get rid of a headache', and then she can heal. Lisa (portrayed by the ever-gorgeous Angelina Jolie) is another inmate at the hospital, who identifies with her mental illness and holds onto it, believing it makes her better than normal people. She's the voice of negativity and stasis, oddly seductive. She introduces herself as a sociopath, but by the end, she says, in what is possibly the most memorable line, ""I'm not really dead inside."" Lisa's story is, in my opinion, more powerful and tragic than Susanna's, and Jolie is definitely the better actress. I completely changed my opinion of her. All in all, it's about escaping yourself, or your own negative side that blocks the path to the remedy. The most important image is close to the end, when Susanna and Lisa are in the basement - Susanna's leaving the next day, and Lisa is tormenting her for submitting to the outside world. Lisa following Susanna through the dark, underground corridors screaming, as Susanna tries desperately to find a way out, is a troubling metaphor for the battle between the dual natures of our own egos. The Frank Sinatra song ""Downtown"" at the end was really sad, for some reason, and it really makes you understand, if you're depressed, that not all happy people are shallow. People that have gone through bad times and come out the other end whole are the strongest of all."

","Too few films today stick with us after the credits roll. Too few films show us a piece of ourselves, even if we are afraid to admit the similarities. Too few films ask us to be proactive and make the movie a catalyst to changing our lives. But films like Girl, Interrupted, What the Bleep, and RevoLOUtion give us enough credit to not just entertain us, but to teach us without condescension and expect us to get off our asses and become better people. Girl, Interrupted is great in that it examines both the positives and negatives of therapy, and while it is life-changing for some, others are just not able to heal by utilizing it. A new film called RevoLOUtion, shows us that some of us can fix ourselves. The character, Lou, has a terrible stutter, but the bigger idea is that we all have had a ""stutter"" moment in our lives and if we have the courage to relive it like Lou does, we can overcome it like Lou does. Most adult issues stem from childhood and if we can go back to that place and understand why it caused a chain reaction that shaped our lives, we can break that chain and move on.

","This was hands down, Angelina Jolie's greatest performance. This was a great movie. Though I wouldn't recommend it to people, especially teenage girls, who have struggled with an eating disorder. I saw this movie when I was 13 and it triggered me into developing an eating disorder. It probably wouldn't affect most people that way...but to impressionable young girls with body issues seeing these beautiful actresses all super-thin is very triggering. Other than that it was an outstanding film. Probably my favorite....and I have seen many. The acting was great. The casting was perfect. I liked how they tied in the what was going on at the time (Vietnam War, free sex, drugs, and Rock and roll) into the movie."

","This is a truly wonderful and well likable film. I thought Angelina Jolie was terrific as the sociopath Lisa and Winona Ryder was excellent as Susanna Kaysen. This film does have some funny moments as well as some dramatic ones, and it is the kind of movie that deserves to be seen again and again. Angelina surely deserved her Oscar for her role. Brittany Murphy was great as Daisy. I knew that Daisy was a real mess and thought it was quite sadistic about her relationship with her dad. But, all in all, it is a wonderful film and I believe that James Mangold did an excellent and outstanding job directing this wonderful entertainment."

","Girl Interrupted Is a very educating film, that goes on to give a very strong image of what the 60's was all about in places like mental hospitals/clinics. The fact that this film is based on a true story by Suzanna Kaysen makes it even more interesting and reliable to the viewer and does make you think what a life she was living in at that period of time. Girl Interrupted is there to answer all your questions. The way that this film is directed, gives you the opportunity to really look into the head of the main actor and actually ""pull"" out all the information needed. This is possible, because the film does a lot of zooming in the eyes of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder)which directly creates a communication between her and the audience, as to how she sees things in the life she is living in the film. On the other hand, female actors like Anjelina Jolie and Winona Ryder are considered very talented in such films ; And lets not forget that Angelina Jolie got an Oscar as ""The best supporting female actor in the year 2000."""

","I primarily went to see ""Girl, Interrupted"" for Angelina Jolie as I've been following her career since ""Hackers"" and she's mesmerizing whatever she's in. She's camera-charismatic, like Greta Garbo and Bette Davis.<br/><br/>I was pretty sure that the Winona Ryder character didn't need to be hospitalized and I was trying to figure out what we'd now say she, and the others, had and how they'd treat it -- depression?<br/><br/>I thought the movie should have been over in the first hour or so when the boyfriend (sigh, Jared Leto) wants her to go off with him, though her decision not to seems to be a turning point in her mental health.<br/><br/>This isn't exactly ""Snake Pit"" because somehow it ends up that therapy is positive, but only because she decides to get well and throw herself into it. So the moral or point is a bit fuzzy. <br/><br/>The two young women behind me hated it and talked back to the screen the whole time for her to get her act together.<br/><br/>The '60's music choices are pretty good.<br/><br/>(orginally written 1/23/2000)"

At first she is frightened until she begins to make friends, once you get into the movie you'll forget that these people are crazy and in a mental ward, or at least I did, I began to think they weren't so crazy after all. After Lisa (jolie) and Susanna (rider) become friends you begin to understand their relationship. the ending is the only part I don't like ever since I saw the ending I wanted to make a second movie and change it, but as i grew older and watch the movie more I guess maybe it all ended up for the best.

"philip_vanderveken","9","0","1","6 January 2005"," A close second if you compare it to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""
","I've always had a problem with movies that say to be based on a true story. Most of the time this means that you'll watch a mediocre TV-movie (at best) that should make you cry your eyes out because of all the misery that happened to this one unfortunate person. Let me put it in another way: when you see the label 'based on a true story', what you'll get is a typical housewife movie. Since I'm not a housewife (I'm a 26 year old male), this kind of movies doesn't appeal to me all that much. But I always like to make exceptions and ""Girl, Interrupted"" deserves better than being called mediocre.<br/><br/>In fact it reminded me a bit of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", the ULTIMATE classic in this genre, with an outstanding Jack Nicholson. Both movies are situated in the seventies (""Girl, Interrupted"" in the sixties and seventies) and both tell the story about a person in a mental institution. The main difference is perhaps that this time it isn't about men, but about women.<br/><br/>Since I'm talking about ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", I will probably have to say which one of the two is the best. Well, the choice wasn't easy to make, but I still prefer ""OFOTCN"". Why? Not because of the acting. In both movies, the acting is of a very high quality. Neither because of the directing or the script, but because of the time it was made in. ""OFOTCN"" was the first of the two to appear and shocked the entire world. It showed how these patients were treated (and sometimes still are, but that's something else). Girl Interrupted isn't that shocking anymore. We already know what it was like back than and it all has been done before, even though this is a real story (which adds a lot to the drama).<br/><br/>However, don't think this movie isn't good. It is very good and shocking, especially when you haven't seen ""OFOTCN"" yet. Let me end by saying that this one is a very close second and that I give it an 8.5/10 (I gave OFOTCN the full 10/10)."

",":::: SPOILERS AHEAD ::::<br/><br/>It took me a while to see this movie, almost entirely because of the name, which is unfair of me because it really is a good movie.<br/><br/>
The movie is about a troubled young girl named Susanna (Ryder), who, through her strange behavior, is committed to a mental institution by her parents. Although she may act a bit strange, she is far from mentally disturbed, and really has no business being in the institution. Her ward-mates are far worse than she is. <br/><br/>While in the institution, she becomes attatched to another female patient, Lisa (Jolie), who is extremely charismatic, but also very independent and rebellious. During the course of Susanna's stay at the institution, the more she becomes closer to Lisa, the worse Susanna becomes, eventually emulating the behavior of Lisa, which gets her into more and more trouble with the authorities. <br/><br/>After escaping one night, Susanna and Lisa crash the house of a former patient, Daisy, who had just been released back into the world. Daisy is still very unstable, and Lisa seems to go out of her way to belittle her. The following morning, Susanna goes upstairs to check on Daisy, and finds her dead, hanging in the bathroom. Horrified by what she sees, Susanna begins to realize that Lisa is not only a bad influence, but is the prime cause of her still being in the institution after one year. Susanna begins to turn her life around, and turn against Lisa at the same time. Eventually, after a fairly dramatic scene in the basement of the institution, Susanna is released back into the world, with a fresh new look on life.<br/><br/>
Girl, Interrupted shows some parrallels with another ""institution"" movie ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Along with some similar situations, it also parallels the basic theme in that institutions can sometimes drive people crazy, rather than help them. Although ""Cuckoo's Nest"" was a far better movie, Girl, Interrupted is still very entertaining, and has much of the same wit as did ""Cuckoo's Nest"" <br/><br/>Recommended for drama fans. <br/><br/>Rating:  8 out of 10."

","After an apparent suicide attempt, Susanna meets with a physiatrist friend of the family who tells her she should go to the local mental institution. She signs herself in but soon after realises the enormity of what she has done  however she cannot leave until they let her go.  An outsider at first she soon befriends the aggressive Lisa and tries to come to terms with the institute around her.<br/><br/>Despite being an Oscar winner I felt no great compulsion to check this film out at the time of it's release  I'm not sure why, perhaps I was put off by the (unfair) claim of it being a `female Cuckoo's Nest'.  However by and large it was my loss as much of this film is good.  The plot's central message that these people are just `normal' people exaggerated is OK and not too sentimentally delivered.  The film is not quite as moving as I felt it should be though  it went just where you expected it to and feel into too many clichéd moments and moments that do touch on the syrupy.  However it is interesting enough to overcome these obstacles and makes for a good watch.<br/><br/>The cast is the main reason for watching.  Ryder is a little too wide eyed for my liking but still does a very good job (and her opening lines about stealing are very funny in retrospect!).  However the real scene-stealer is Jolie who brings a realistic energy to the film.  When she is off screen you really feel her loss as the film does dip a little into sentiment. Goldberg's character is the weak link as much of the sentimentality comes from her direction, she walks around with her assured smug air and you just know she's going to bond and hug with somebody.  Murphy, DuVall and Moss all do well in support (although I found Moss a little too sing-songy). Redgrave, Tamborand and Leto give small roles but good support as well.<br/><br/>Overall this is not as good a film as Cuckoo's Nest but I think the comparisons are perhaps a little simplistic and unfair.  As it is this is a good film that only loses it a little at the end where it tips into a bit of preaching and sentimentality.  I think it bothered me more than it should because I know Mangold can control this aspect well as he did excellently in Heavy.  But these are minor complaints and it is involving and has a two strong performances in the lead."
"fleapit_fred","Null","0","2","28 April 2003"," Not mad, just stupid
","No subject has been worse treated in cinema than mental illness, and Girl, Interrupted comfortably lives down to the standard of films like The Snake Pit, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and the jaw-droppingly dreadful Dudley Moore comedy Crazy People. To be fair, it's bad in a mildly original way. Instead of following the ""mad people are really more sane than us"" line (a cruel and sentimental lie), the fantasy of mental health care as social repression (asylums as gulags of the soul), or the pop-Freudian approach popular in films of the 1940s and 1950s, it presents mental illness as a lifestyle option that marks out the really cool and interesting young person (and a great way of annoying your parents). This spark of originality, however, is what makes the film (and the book) so outstandingly detestable.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder's character, like most of her fellow inmates, is not mentally ill by any clinical definition. She's just bored, neurotic, self-obsessed and given to acting out little psycho-dramas to attract attention - in other words, a western-world teenager of privileged background, only more extreme than most. In time she would grow up, quit reading Sylvia Plath, and realise that other people exist. In the meantime, all the treatment she needs is some basic Dr Spock behaviour management from her parents, and maybe a stint of voluntary work with a charity that helps people with real problems.<br/><br/>
The success of this film is a depressing comment on our narcissistic culture and an insult to the millions of mostly ordinary, unglamorous, and poor people who have to live in the miserable, frightening, and stigmatising world of mental illness.<br/><br/>If you want to see a film that at least tries to deal honestly and humanely with this subject, try Family Life, by Ken Loach, or Samuel Fuller's slightly sensationalist but insightful Shock Corridor. David Mamet's House of Games, though it's not about mental illness, contains a short scene in a mental hospital, in which a patient utters a single line of script that says far more about the nature of madness than the whole of Girl, Interrupted. To commit the artistic crime of altering a Bob Dylan lyric (by switching the gender words from male to female), there are a couple of lines in Visions of Johanna that sum up this repulsive film perfectly: ""Little girl lost, she takes herself so seriously/ She brags of her misery, she likes to live dangerously ..."" But not too dangerously, of course. Just enough to be cool."

","When I first saw this movie I was not touched but I was impressed at the great performances given by Ryder and Jolie.  This is why I later decided to give it another look.  After viewing it a second time I came to realize that this movie had to be made.  It shines a great light on a subject which isn't discussed, mental illness. As Susanna is struggling with her view of the world she first must realize that her view may not be the correct one, this is the stranglehold that is Borderline Personality disorder.<br/><br/> It is interesting to note that her interaction with the other patients wasn't necessarily a positive one, I think she had even more trouble accepting her own problem while in the presence of other troubled people.<br/><br/> I feel that the turning point in the movie is when she refuses to leave the hospital and go to Canada with her ""boyfriend"", but for the first time in the movie seems to acknowledge the fact that she has a real life problem that must be dealt with and that running away from that problem will not solve it.<br/><br/> After the second viewing of the movie I found it difficult to sleep becuase of thoughts of how accurate the movie depicts life in a mental institution.<br/><br/> This is a movie that everyone should see, and I especially recommend it to anyone who is struggling with depression or some sort of mental illness."
"sparkle_in_the_rain","10","0","1","3 January 2003"," One for the Girls
","Be aware: the ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" comparison only goes so far. And never, ever, in a derogatory fashion. ""Girl, Interrupted"" is set in the female ward of a women's psychiatric hospital, in the 70's and details the Protagonist's, Susanna Kaysen, struggle to rid herself of the craziness which she feels haunts her.Ryder fits into her role with a comfort which you know is almost too close. However this is very much Jolie's movie. She gives a performance which, like Susanna, the audience are forced to fall in love with the Sociopath Lisa, and believe that it is a good thing. If viewers are not Jolie fans before watching this they certainly will be afterwards. Another lovely  performance is from the delightful (and, like Jolie and Ryder, scarily convincing in character) Brittany Murphy, whose chicken hoarding Daisy sparkles throughout the movie, however briefly. Mangold directs in an almost fairytale-like style which forces his audience to become completely enthralled in Claymore life, and encourages that between sane and insane there is a fine line which we all tread. The movie fills the gaps which are left in Kaysen's stirring memoir, making it  a startling adaptation, and awakening movie. Shifting between touching and gripping, funny and sad, Girl, Interrupted is a movie worth the praise it is given."

"danielll_rs","8","0","2","29 April 2000"," Much more than a '""Cuckoo's Nest"" rip-off'
","Rating: ***1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Sometimes movie critics are very mean with some films, just because of a single detail. That's what happened to ""Cruel Intentions"" (it was said to be a stupid, offensive version of ""Les Liaison Dangereuses""), ""Stigmata"" (not a masterpiece, but misunderstood) and ""Girl, Interrupted"". This movie received some not very exciting reviews, mostly because critics argued that it was a 'rip-off ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""'. But I think they were at least VERY unfair. The only similarity I can see is that both are placed at a mental institution, where a normal, not crazy person is sent for some reason. Only this and nothing more. While ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a deep and complex study of the human mind, ""Girl, Interrupted"" talks about how difficult adolescence is, with no pretension to be an instant classic. And guess what? I totally enjoyed it.<br/><br/>""Girl, Interrupted"", directed by James Mangold, tells the (true) story of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young woman who tries to kill herself by drinking a bottle of vodka with a bottle of aspirin in the end of the '60s. Her parents believe that she has some mental problem, and send her to Claymoore, a mental institution where she will literally have her life changed. There she meets new and interesting people: Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), a rather rigid nurse, Georgina (Clea DuVall), a pathological liar, Polly (Elizabeth Moss), a ingenuous girl with half of her face burned, Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a selfish girl who has a thing about chickens, among others. But one of them will be responsible for her change: Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a pretty, sexy, irresponsible sociopath who will build a relationship of mixed feelings with Susanna.<br/><br/>The story is interesting, but would be nothing without a good screenplay. This aspect surprised me, because I thought this would be a sentimental, ingenuous film. In fact, the screenplay is almost the opposite. It is warm, human, clever, keeps the attention of the audience and- believe it or not - there is no big cliché. Well, we can predict the end, but we can't predict each scene, each quote and what will happen to each character. I really liked this detail.<br/><br/>There are many qualities here (the soundtrack, for example, is excellent, amazing), but the biggest one is the acting. I had my doubts about Angelina Jolie's performance before watching the film. I knew she was a great actress, but did she deserve the Oscar as best supporting actress? Now that I saw the film I can say 'YES'. Even competing with Catherine Keener and Chloe Sevigny, she was quite superior. Her character is a mixture of 'mad girl' with 'sexy woman'. And Angelina plays Lisa with an amazing strength. But she doesn't own the film. We can't forget of the talented Winona Ryder, who was distant of screens for some time, since the terrible ""Alien Resurrection"". She does a great comeback.<br/><br/>What I have to conclude is that ""Girl, Interrupted"" is not a copy of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". They are two different films with slightly similar themes. ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is better, of course, but ""Girl, Interrupted"" has its qualities, which are not few. It's a must-see."

","I couldn't avoid the comparison between the performance of the two leading actresses in this amazing movie. As I couldn't avoid the comparison with the brilliant ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" of 1975.  The latter was an unbeatable classic with Jack Nicholson earning the Oscar and with a plot close to perfection. ""Girl, Interrupted"" is a more soft and realistic movie. The pace is slower, but it gives you time to appreciate the interpretation of the excellent cast, with Winona at her best playing Susanna Kaysen. Her sequences with Whoopi and Jolie are memorable and she deserved an Oscar nomination. As for Angelina, she has played a strong character with great talent. She plays every sequence naturally, and makes them look easy for her. However, I think Winona's character is deeper and more difficult to play than Angelinas's Lisa. Winona has clearly devoted herself to her character in this movie. She might not be as versatile as Angelina, but she is perfect for this kind of role. If you don't like Winona Ryder (is that possible?), you can still enjoy this movie because of the supporting cast (Elizabeth Moss is also awesome as Polly)."

","A cool soundtrack is the first thing I noticed about this movie ... a haunting score contrasted with pumping 60s tunes like ""Downtown"" along with really gentle stuff like ""End of the World"" (which *has* to be the world's most depressing song, especially after the way it's used in this movie) ... Then there's the acting, and we all know how good Angelina Jolie is in everything, and in this - well, let me tell you that anything you've read about it (and her performance has been written about a lot!) is totally true, she's amazing in this movie. But that shouldn't be your only reason for seeing it. This movie has the best cast ever from the major roles to the minor roles like Vanessa Redgrave, Whoopi Goldberg (her best performance ever, in my opinion) and the *brilliant* performance of Angela Bettis as Janet (keep an eye out for her, she's the blonde who isn't in many scenes but is totally amazing).<br/><br/>The movie is kind of depressing in a lot of ways - if you've had troubles in life (and haven't we all) you'll find this movie is a real downer at times, like when they're all talking about how 'wonderful' an escape suicide can be and stuff ... but if you stick with it, you find a real positive message too. And, believe me, you'll be humming ""Downtown"" on your way out.<br/><br/>:)"

","I went to this movie for two reasons - a) I studied psych in college and b) Winona Ryder.  I made a wise choice.  While there will be inevitable comparisons made to ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", that's not fair. ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a character study of the inhabitants of a mental institution.  ""Girl, Interrupted"" is more about inhabiting one, I think. Winona Ryder's lead character grows and changes, but generally stays in control.  Angelina Jolie has another amazing role to play with.  The only real flaws I felt were that the film could've used some more, er, uh, grit, but it's okay.  Check out the director's other movie ""Heavy"" - I loved that one too."

","I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I like Winona Ryder and I adore Angelina Jolie. The two together make for a standout piece of movie making. I had not been recently impressed with Ms. Ryder's work but my faith has been restored with this performance. She is absolutely wonderful. So strong at one moment and so in need of sympathy at the next. She gives a multi layered take on her character that really portrays the turmoil she is in as so realistic. And what can I say about Angelina Jolie? Another knockout turn to be sure. The woman knows how to act plain and simple. The power she brings to the screen is incredible. I found that the scenes she was not in while very good to be sure, were calling out for her quick return. She has a very bright future ahead in Hollywood. The film itself blends both comedy and pathos. A wonderful combination that will have the viewer laughing and then frowning a moment later. The emotions flow freely and very quickly. Very few dull moments here. I highly recommend this film. It has a few depressing moments as would be expected from the subject matter, but the overall story is handled so deftly you must watch every moment of it and will be very eager to see how it all works out."

I haven't read the book (yet), but I can't imagine even the highest intellectuals being disappointed in this film.  Wynona Ryder is marvelous, but the true star of the film is Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Jolie is one of the best actresses I've ever had the pleasure to watch onscreen.  She doesn't play roles; she becomes her character.  In 'Girl,' her performance is chillingly delightful.  You sit in the theater feeling compassion for this socio-path while at the same time fearing what she'll do next.  Looking into her eyes is madness.<br/><br/>This is the first movie I've seen featuring Ryder that I enjoyed as much as her first really good, thought-provoking film 'Heathers.'  Wynona Ryder fully matures in this role as a young girl suffering from a borderline personality disorder.  She, along with Jolie, will go so many further places with the astonishment of such A+ performances.<br/><br/>The film reminds me a lot of Sylvia Plath's autobiographical novel examining her own mental breakdown.  Both are equally compelling and moving in answering examining the questions: what exactly constitutes insanity?  how different does one deemed so operate from the ""normal"" individual?<br/><br/>'Girl, Interrupted' will leave you breathless and begging for more."

The first one is they make being in the nut farm a fun happy place to be. I mean come on, they didn't act to depressed to me.  Skipping medicine and going to the underground tunnels to a bowling alley? Come on, how many nut farms actually have a bowling alley? Then they sneak off to the doctor's office where one of the patients just happens to have a set of keys and look at their medical record. The second thing I didn't like was how we didn't find out what happened to the other patients? Did they tell you what happens in the book?  If they do please click on my name and leave me a message and let me know cause i am dieing to find out. This movie was so touching that I cried.  Winonna Ryder did such a good job as Susanna that i'm surprised that she didn't get an award.  Angelina Jolie did an excellent job playing a socialpath.

","I absolutely loved this movie!!!!!!! I fell in love with it instantly. Now it's my second favorite of all time! Winona is the BEST actress in Hollywood. She's way *hotter* than all of them, and that includes Jennifer Lopez!!!! This is probably her best role. It is based on the psychiatric memoirs of the writer Susana Kaysen of the same title (published in '93). Ads for the flick boast that it is based on a true story, though none of the things that happened in the movie were in the book. They even go as far as changing the hospital's name (it's not really Claymoore, it's McLean). It's a fascinating book that i highly recomend, but let's put that aside and look at the movie. Ryder plays a teen entering womanhood when she attempts suicide for no apparant reason. She lives in her head, is always day dreaming, very immature and childlike, and doesn't have female friends but has many boyfriends. Look closely at the first chapter. After the therapist talked to her for only what seems like less than an hour, he sentences her to a teenage girls' mental hospital. When Susana goes into the cab, she notices her luggage had already been packed and ready to go. And her mom is across the street in a car waving quietly (just the Mom, but how about the dad?). She doesn't even step out to hug her daughter good bye! How suspicious. The fun really starts when she gets to the hospital and meets all of the crazy chicks. Her roommate is a cute, nice girl named Georgina who reads THE WIZARD OF OZ all the time. And then we get our first impression of Jolie's character being dragged back to the isolation room after a two week escape attempt. Her name's Lisa, and she's the most prominant of the all patients. She seems to poccess all of the answers concerning the way the world works and how people think so she becomes Susana's idol. The first half of the movie goes deeper and deeper into Susana's mind, and then the second half becomes 'The adventures of Susana and Lisa', but i didn't mind. Their adventures were incredibly fun. At some point Susana doesnt wanna leave because for the first time in her life she has real friends. What you'll remember the most is the cast, they're the best collection of characters ever assembled!!!!!!!! Each one is perfectly played by loveable actresses like Brit Murphy and Clea Duvall. You'll also fall in love with the original score. But what's the point of this movie? Well, i think it was trying to show as a girl's unwilling passage into womenhood, and how her childishness earned her a one and a half year vacation from the real world. But at some point, she realizes that the vacation can't last forever because it would lead her life to a dead end. It's also about friendship.<br/><br/>**I GAVE IT 10/10*.

","I have NO idea why this movie hasn't become more famous! It is a very good story, told in a way that doesn't make us feel stupid nor disappointed. The movie goes so well that I was only waiting for it to crumble... my surprise was that IT DIDN'T! The movie stays solid all the way, and the actresses and the direction make the movie even better! I believe that showing psychological problems like this is rare, since everyone still sees psychoanalysts and nurses as monsters ( ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""... ) or doesn't understand enough about it to make a decent movie. We see authentic human beings portrayed in ""Girl, Interrupted"". No evil character, no perfect person. Only people struggling to live their lives in the best way they can. It is a lesson for all ""suicidal"" teenagers without being moralist, it is passionate and modern. There are powerful dialogues and characters that stay in your mind. This movie is far better than ""The Sixth Sense""... I hated that movie! It is pointless, confusing, doesn't teach anything useful... the only thing that is ( a little ) good is its ending. Anyway, I prefer Fight Club's. I believe this movie is also better than ""The Green Mile"", that is  VERY predictable, has BAD and GOOD characters ( sounds like a child's tale... ), remains pointless and is way too long. I would rather have seen ""Girl, Interrupted"" in the Academy Awards than these movies listed above. I can truly give a 10 to this movie and put it on the top of my list, with American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Run Lola Run, Taxi Driver and some others. I recommend this movie to all teenagers who can't find themselves and their role in life because they are too spoiled to see the truth behind everything."

Rebelling against the head nurse, the physchiatrist, Susan Kaysen chooses to befriend the resident 혩loonies', a group of troubled women. But after almost year of both flirting and struggling with the thin line between normal and crazy, Susanna realizes that to win freedom she must faces the one thing that terrifies her the most - herself.<br/><br/>What an unbelievable movie. It shows the audience how crazy the world can get for some people. The lead role by Winona Ryder, was probably the most powerful of her career, as she reenacts the life of Susanna Kaysen. We go on an emotional rollercoaster ride with Susanna from start to finish of the movie. The opening scene of the movie shows Sue with a therapist and he explains that she has a problem. `Four days ago you chased a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of Vodka' and then Sue denies it by saying `I had a headache'. She is then recommended to Claymoores, a mental institution for people with all sorts of problems. Here is where the movie does get entruging. We meet different patients, who Susanna befriends including, Georgina the uncontrollable Liar, Burn victim Polly and the loudest character in the house, Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. No wonder this role won her an academy award, it was truly brilliant. Lisa rebelled, with a nasty, evil and selfish way about her. While Susanna was the exact opposite of Lisa, even though Lisa somehow fascinated her at the sametime. All in all we live through what it is like to live with 혩Crazy people' and how they handle various situations in life. The results can sometimes be happy and others can have lasting affects which hurt and scar you. Other characters to look out for include Whoopi Goldberg as the head nurse and chief psychiatrist played by Vanessa Redgrave. <br/><br/>Rating: 5/5 Stars or 10/10"
