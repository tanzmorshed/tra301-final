","Shakespeare gets a Hollywood make over in Baz Luhrmann's high-octane remake of Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>The Australian director manages to combine an exciting mix of original Shakespearean dialect and Hollywood action, which together delivers a brilliant new concept to film making.<br/><br/>The casting of Leonardo Di Caprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet are inspired choices, as they both give the best performance of their fledgling careers.<br/><br/>Although this is a story which has been told many times before, Luhrmann keeps the idea fresh, mainly by using a lovely mixture of fast editing and beautifully choreographed fight scenes, which wouldn't look out of place in a John Woo action film. It also combines a fantastic soundtrack with a stunning backdrop of 'Verona Beach'.<br/><br/>Right from the explosive beginning to the tragic ending, Romeo and Juliet will keep you captivated. This is a testament to Luhrmann's brilliant snappy direction, which will take you on a rollercoaster ride of car chases, gun fights and a love that was destined to fail.<br/><br/>Luhrmann's ablity to keep the audience wanting more is no more apparent than the ending. You would have to have been living under a rock, for the last 100 years to not know how Romeo and Juliet ends. But Luhrmann manages to keep the audience hoping that this time it will be different.<br/><br/>Would Will Shakespeare be happy with this adaptation of his work? We'll never know, although any fans of Shakespeare should leave the cinema pleased with this mordernised version."

","Very underrated modernization of the classic Shakespeare play.  This movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors outlandishness in cinematography, but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes, and in fact this relationship tends to amplify their potency. Beautifully choreographed and shot, wonderfully acted by both the supporting cast and the main 2 stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and extremely sly modernization techniques to the dialogue.  All the elizabethan dialogue remains intact, yet it all seems coherent in the modern atmosphere. mostly due to good imagery and double meaning in the phrases (ex: their swords being a gun model, or the flash of money while quoting gold.).  One of the best shakespeare adaptations in the multitude of which have entered the cinemas in the past few years."
"starry-eyed_wanderer","9","132","193","1 April 2005"," Beautiful Modernization of Shakespeare's Classic Play
","The amazing thing about this movie is that it has managed to re-do Shakespeare's famous tragedy in a modern setting while still retaining its original dialogue. What's even more amazing is it works. I admit that I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie, fearing that Luhrman had either destroyed the play's beauty and power by setting it in modern times, or had butchered Shakespeare's eloquent words by making them sound more modern. I was wrong. Almost everything about this movie is just incredible.<br/><br/>Luhrman brilliantly casted Claire Danes as fourteen-year-old Juliet. The actress certainly looks the part, with her youthful features and innocent eyes. More importantly, she acts the part. Ms. Danes almost flawlessly captures Juliet's distressing journey from childhood to womanhood, beautifully showing her dramatic transition which had taken toll on her during her five day relationship with Romeo. When the story begins, Juliet is a naive girl, having not yet experienced true love, and by the end we can clearly see just how much her love for Romeo has deepened in passion, and how dramatically her character has developed.<br/><br/>Leanardo DeCaprio's Romeo was almost equally impressive. Some of his recitations of Shakespeare made me cringe, but for the most part he was perfect. One of Romeo's most important characteristics in the play is the intensity of his emotions, and DeCaprio captures this feature incredibly. Romeo is brash and impulsive, with a tendency to act on the heat of the moment rather than to first consider the situation like the more levelheaded Juliet. This unfortunate characteristic, which played a huge role in leading up to the lovers' tragic fate, is wonderfully mastered by DeCaprio and retained throughout the film. But we also, like with Juliet, get a glimpse of his character's development. At the beginning of the play Romeo is a hopeless romantic who fantasizes of love, and seems to dwell more in his daydreamed world than actually on earth. At this point he has no idea what true love really is, he only thinks he does. It is not until he meets Juliet that he can begin to comprehend the true depth and passion of love. DeCaprio triumphs in this area as well.<br/><br/>The other actors are superb, and wonderfully portray their characters as Shakespeare intended. But what really impressed me was, as I stated earlier, the keeping of Shakespeare's original dialogue in Luhrman's modern setting. I know some people criticize this film for destroying the romance and beauty of Shakespeare's words by setting the story in modern day Verona, but I feel that it only made the film more romantic. What Luhrman did was both bold and brilliant, and he succeeded wonderfully.<br/><br/>I won't speak any more of the brilliance of this film, I just highly recommend you see it as soon as possible. If you're a fan of Shakespeare like me, I think you will enjoy this hip, yet still lovely, modernization of his most famous play ever."
"neon47","9","119","180","7 June 2005"," Moderized Without Losing the Shakespeare
","I'm a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their ""lives will pay the forfeit of the peace."" We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that's because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven't seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you'll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who's who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo's best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I'd rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren't getting it, it's Romeo is the ""knight in shinning armor,"" Juliet is the angel of Romeo's dreams, and Romeo's best friend is the comic relief. There's other things you'll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he's a villain). Both families you'll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you're a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It'll sweep you off you're feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love."
"Cherry-19","10","133","205","30 December 1999"," An eye-catching, starkly bold and breathtaking update of Shakespeare's greatest work.
","This film is incredible. Yes, the play is modernized, and for those who panned the film, I suppose originality was too much to take. Luhrmann stays with the original dialogue, which I believe adds much to the film and gives it authenticity. Therefore it cannot be dismissed as a masterpiece dumbed down to appeal to us easy to please teenagers. The camera work at the most dark parts of the film is quick and choppy, adding to the already potent and ever present depressing, tragic atmosphere. All of the leads were strong, with Danes and DiCaprio having amazing chemistry. In this film DiCaprio wasn't popular yet, so again critics can't say Leo was the draw for this film. Danes was emotionally pure and driven, and this is her best work to date aside from the critical darling, ""My So-Called Life."" No, the leads were cast with good reason - there couldn't have been any better. Supporting roles were wonderful, with the roles of Mercutio and Tybalt being exceptional, and the friar, who may be the most important character in the story, is brought to life by Postalwaithe  The dreamy underwater shots are fantastic. Luhrmann's version of this classic tragedy plays to both a younger and older audience, adding touches such as the names of the guns being the names of swords; and he yet updates the setting, bringing the fantastic Verona, Italy to Verona Beach, Florida. A timeless story such as this makes any criticism of this film unnecessary and foolish; view it with an open mind and you will see the story as Shakespeare wrote it and as Luhrmann envisioned it."
"PizzicatoFishCrouch","9","62","96","17 August 2006"," Shakespeare made sexy for the teen generation.
","Everyone is familiar with William Shakespeare's boy-meets-girl love story, and it has already been interpreted into films, plays, TV adaptations and songs. But Baz Luhrmann gives this world-known love story a modern-day twist, setting it in Verona Beach, and piling on the religious imagery. The result is quite spectacular.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes play the star-crossed lovers, and, whilst the latter is sadly a little bland, never truly convincing us in her portrayal of Juliet's loss of innocence or torment of feelings towards the foe, DiCaprio completely redeems her performance. He is a revelation. His Romeo is a wonderful mix of sad eloquence, a loving heart and a troubled soul, and all these elements come together beautifully in a performance hotter than a pepper sprout, with more layers than the proverbial onion. He is the very embodiment of sexy in his role. There is an extremely alluring way in which his character is filmed, which only enhances Romeo as a lover. This is epitomized in the opening shot of him, where the Leo is illuminated illustriously against the sunlight, and Radiohead's languid, sexy tune ""Talk Show Host"" plays.<br/><br/>The film itself has ""sexy"" written all over it, and, with the Gen X teenagers as his target audience, I don't think Luhrmann would have things any other way. But, unlike with that atrocity Moulin Rouge!, with Romeo + Juliet, the over-stylization is appropriate, making the movie more accessible to teens, for example, through gun warfare rather than swordplay, and the canny symbolisation of Queen Mab as a drug. But perhaps the most ingenious stylistic technique here is the slap-in-face Shakespearean references, which range from a ball called the Merchant of Venice, to 'Such stuff as dreams are made on' from The Tempest, making the film an absolute goldmine for trivia fans.<br/><br/>Style aside, there is more than enough substance. Romeo is presented exactly as the play does  at first, the mawkish, gawky, lovesick teenager, then, the fickle boy, and finally, the devoted and caring lover, and much of this loyalty to the play is due to the screenplay from Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, which maintains the original memorable dialogue and descriptions, but also dares to stray from the sidewalk in some of the plot turns, and the film completely benefits from it. The set designs are intricate and beautiful, and suit every frame of the film perfectly, and the icing on the cake is the music. Craig Armstrong's score for the swimming pool scene is as stunning as it is original, and the use of non-original music, from Kym Mazelle to The Cardigans, give the film the added edge of cool, making Romeo + Juliet one of the boldest, sassiest and most unforgettable adaptations to date, and English Lit. GCSE has been made far more digestible for us kids across England. It's what Shakespeare would have wanted. A-."
"Adrianne Parent","Null","68","107","3 January 1999"," A contemporary twist to a classic play
","Director Baz Luhrmann knew what he was doing when he cast Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio in the title roles of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  The two young actors have the power to captivate their audience and together, they are unsurpassable.<br/><br/>From the famous opening line of ""Two Households both alike in dignity.."" to the tragic end, the viewer is whisked away into the depths of the surrealistic world of Verona Beach.  Don't expect to see British people prancing around in tights when you rent this one.  Luhrmann creates a world where gun toting teens sport Hawaiian shirts and beach front brawls are an everyday event.<br/><br/>Giving the classic play this modern twist makes for a new understanding of the text and brings the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets to a whole new level.  Shakespeare may be rolling around in his grave after seeing this film, but english classes all over the world can breathe a little easier when it comes time to take the R&J final exam because this new adaptation makes the theme remarkably understandable.<br/><br/>Danes brings life and incentive to the character of Juliet.  Danes' Juliet reaches far beyond the subservient stereotype of most Elizabethan characters and has ambition and assertion. It is a step beyond her critically acclaimed work in ""My So-Called Life"" and has thankfully made her a more prominent figure in the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>This marked the last feature for Leonardo DiCaprio, pre-Titanic mayhem. It put his talent out for a wider range of audience, R&J being his first major studio production.  The king of the indie and the ""troubled child"" role was now being recognized.  His passionate portrayl of Romeo Montague will forever be remembered.  He spoke the immortal words of Shakespeare as if they were his own and touched the hearts of millions.  Too bad the boat movie shoved him further into the spotlight than he had ever wanted.  But we won't get into that.<br/><br/>The supporting cast in this film was also outstanding.  John Leguizamo played the wily, Tybalt.  Harold Perrineau brought humor and diversity to the renowned role of Mercutio.  Big names also lit up the credits of R&J with Paul Sorvino and Brian Dennehey as Capulet and Montague as well as Pete Postlethwaite as the star-cross'd lovers confidante, Friar Laurence.<br/><br/>This is my favorite movie of all time and I believe it was sadly underrated."
"tedg","Null","79","130","16 June 2000"," Poetry to Visual Affect
","This is not Shakespeare's best play, but it has his best poetry; that's because the play is ABOUT language, about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. So among the plays, this may be one of the hardest to film. But alas it suffers from another blessing which is also a curse: the story itself is so powerful that one can build any sort of film or play or whatever around it and have it be likely to work. Thus, we often lose the language.<br/><br/>Zefrelli made his own choices in the earlier film; these were relatively conventional. While it cut some valuable language, sacrificed to the gods of contemporary patience, it is by far the better version. But here we have some interesting choices.<br/><br/>First the setting. Italians to Shakespeare's England were a comical people, and his setting of the play there would have encouraged the audience to bring heavy stereotypes to the drama. Latins in his day were considered: Foppish: Quick to violence (a stereotype that has been inherited by blacks today, but to Londoners, Italians were nearly Africans): Incredibly proud especially as regards slights to masculinity: Obsessed with weapons.<br/><br/>Today, we roll those up under the relatively crude notion of stupid Latin macho. In this film, the director has exaggerated the Latin macho ethic to have the same effect 16th century Londoners would get. It works because these stereotypes are powerful memes which attract many hosts which perpetuate their underlying truth. Baz adds the additional dimension of the people being captured by the superstitious underbelly of the Church.<br/><br/>He deliberately straddles the border between apparent truth and satire. These Latins are superficial visually and not verbally. So here is the solution to the problem on how to make a film (which is primarily a visual medium) out of a play that leverages poetic language. The solution is to convert all the metaphors from language to vision. Hence the much-noted lack of poetry. I imagine Baz directing the players to not worry so much about the poetry.<br/><br/>Both Romeo and Juliet are incapable of performing the poetry anyway: they are children learning on the job. And what acting skill they have from film is all in the face, not the tongue. They are pretty enough though.<br/><br/>I like this film for its boldness. Some of the experiment works since we get the message of the difference between what we see and what is true. This is why Juliet has to see a LIVE Romeo at the end. Living under water is used to good effect. But in the real play, there are so many and such subtle explorations of the theme, and these are scoured away here for a few broad effects. The real message, which comes through loud and clear if you know the play (or even Zefrelli's film) is not the distance between the reality of events and the language, but the reality of the richness of the real play and this film. Equally vast. Equally powerful statement. So we have a playhouse with the back part blasted out to the sea.<br/><br/>As a separate matter, the play has three anchors: Mercutio, the Friar and the Nurse. These are handled interestingly here.<br/><br/>The Friar is an alchemical master hiding under the cloak of the Church. The play equates the magic of language with the magic of potions, equally deadly. The congruence is lost in this film, but Baz definitely gets the magic part as well as the superfluous ritual of the church. This friar is a terrific, memorable performance of someone who believes he can defeat nature. Serves as an anchor as intended.<br/><br/>The Nurse is the true domestic, raw nature, full of uncompromised loyalty but ultimately compromised. Her character is lost here. We NEED to know about the dead sister and why the nurse turns on Juliet in order to save her life. Baz fails here, and so provides no center. For Shakespeare, she's the white space on the palette.<br/><br/>Mercutio in the play is a emotionally engaged visionary mystic. We understand that Romeo and Mercutio studied magic (`philosophy') abroad together much as Hamlet and Horatio had. The dream they shared the night before is the axis of the whole action: rather like the magic of the witches in Macbeth. Baz gets this as well: Modern magic is what? Drugs. So Hamlet is given a psychotropic by Mercutio before going to the party. Works for me, because it allows everything to be visually blasted and inexorably tragic. The whole thing after the party is a trip, see? It is why they can meet, become entranced and arrange marriage after an hour or two. (Remember that until this point Romeo is hopelessly smitten by Roseline.)<br/><br/>Anyone who wrestles with problems of filming the Bard and comes out alive deserves my respect. This is a weird interpretation, but that's the point."
"afreimann","10","81","139","26 September 2004"," Shakespeare that ANYONE can enjoy!
","I highly recommend this for those who find the reading of Shakespearean text difficult but have a desire to explore his masterful works. The modern-day setting and the brilliant dramatic interpretations rendered by the actors (all wonderfully cast, incidentally) transform Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece into a modern-day cinematic tour de force. DiCaprio and Danes are believably cast together (although Danes' natural conservatism is occasionally apparent, though not to any detrimental affect). Sorvino as Capulet is forceful, powerful,and immovable (just what this viewer believes Shakespeare probably had in mind as he penned the classic). Mercutio (Harold Perrineau Jr.) is powerfully moving in the entirety of his portrayal. This movie is visually mesmerizing. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and appreciation for excellent theatre."

","This is the worst, albeit most hilarious version of any Shakespearean play I have ever seen. It was simply ridiculous, and although it was intended to be a tragedy, this movie is not. Unless you consider bad movies ""tradgedies"".<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio was mediocre as Romeo, although Claire Danes was good in the role of Juliet. There were several points in which it moved from tragic and poignant to stupid and absurd. One such time was when Romeo is driving down the street before he kills Tybalt, he is screaming as if possessed. This was a bit over-done. There are others, such as the over-dramatized and misinterpreted scene towards the end, where Romeo is about to drink the poison. Juliet opens her eyes and reaches her hand up towards him, while he continues talking, completely oblivious!!! Where, may I ask, is that in the original play?! <br/><br/>I guess I am just another traditionalist, and I acknowledge that Baz Luhrmann has a right to his own interpretation, and that there are those that truly enjoyed this movie. However, I honestly believe that Shakespeare would be appalled at how his brilliant and incredible works have been adapted to the silver screen."
"cbrinkm","1","54","101","17 February 2005"," A horrible remake of a classic story
","I find it a shame that there is only one peer submitted review of this awful version of a classic play that has withstood the test of time. As such, I wish to give another view, as well as an opposing view to the only one on here.<br/><br/>Luhrmann may stay with the original dialog, but he plays fast and loose with the script. Anyone who has actually sat down and read the play as Shakespeare wrote it would know this. Example: Opening scene. In this ""version"" the Capulets are the targets of the Montague's insults. In the real version, this is reversed. A minor yet significant example, since in the original the reader has a small sympathy for the Montagues who are apparently just minding their own business when these idiots harass them. The names of the families on the guns to represent their ""swords"" is just ludicrous, not to mention the ""duel"" between DiCaprio and Tybalt. And yes, DiCaprio wasn't popular when this film was made, but that doesn't mean he did a good job at acting his part. He didn't. Nor did Claire Danes. They sounded like my 9th grade peers reading the text from their English book in total monologue. No emotion, no passion, no reason to listen to them, 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>And while we are on the subject of DiCaprio's reaction to Mercutio's death, why don't we talk about a little something known as ""Breaking the Tension,"" something that Luhrmann does better than anyone. During the famous scene where Romeo's best friend dies, we see perhaps the one and only time Leo shows true emotion to convey sorrow of losing his friend. Then we see the rage in his eyes as he swears revenge on his enemy. The pressure builds. We can feel the tension building up.<br/><br/>Then out of the blue Danes is singing a song and laying on her bed, leaving us to wonder what the heck just happened.<br/><br/>Do you see what has happened? We were all set, ready to see this dramatic scene unfold and climax, knowing its inevitable conclusion, we felt the blood rushing as we leaned forward on the edge of our seats, then we are smacked in the head with a sappy, lovely scene.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows anything about filmography knows that this completely breaks the tension that was building up. That is bad. It is bad because now the audience feels like it has been removed from the action, like waking up from a dream suddenly. After doing that, it is impossible to get back into the movie. And sure enough, we see Mr. Leo with a fixed look of anger and determination. We see him take out a scared Tybalt. But you know what? We don't care anymore, because we're still miffed about a moment ago when Luhrmann decided to throw us for a loop. We can't engage the moment anymore because we're now between two opposite feelings: One being the love Danes has for her Leo, and the hatred and anger Leo has for Tybalt. If Luhrmann had done this right, he would have had the entire scene with Romeo from the beginning to end (like Franco Zeffirelli did) and THEN put Danes bedroom scene in, AFTER the ""duel"" between protagonist and villain. This way, we would have felt the way Juliet does when she realizes something is wrong. We would have felt her world fall apart in front of her eyes when we were supposed to have done so: After the fight with Tybalt winds down and Romeo's rage is calmed.<br/><br/>And give me a break regarding the ""this movie is above criticism"" line. Even without all of its flaws (which, by the way, I have only touched some of the flaws in slight detail) ANY movie, ANY book, ANY play, ANY song, ANY piece of art that has, is or ever will be made for commercial use is open to criticism. Why? Because the author/artist/writer/etc. wants to be paid for their work. Now, if I am going to pay for something, I want the item in question to be quality. That goes for everything, including movies. I have only seen this movie in passing on the television, so I have not paid a penny for it. Nor will I.<br/><br/>And yes it is dumbed down for teenagers. Watching this version is like watching the vast majority of MTV music videos. They look visually pleasing, but that's to cover up the fact that the performers can't write good music. Same concept here.<br/><br/>In short, if you want a good Romeo and Juliet movie, this isn't it."

","There are many kinds of films. There are the few truly magnificent ones that change us while never ceasing to lose our attention. There are also the mediocre, abounding and forgettable.<br/><br/>Then there are the films so ridiculous, so contrived, so terribly self-important that it forgets its purpose in the first place, that it forever marks our memories no matter how badly we may wish to forget it. This film just may be the crown jewel of that entire lot.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the story. Two star-crossed lovers who despite their passion can not seem to overcome the chains from the family feud that should divide them, and by weaving a web of lies and secrecy end up destroying themselves with it. It remains more or less unchanged in the movie, aside from needed adaptations to suit the new time period, but it simply does not work. The play itself is rather contrived. To expect an audience to see people in modern day falling into the same pitfalls as their Elizabethan counterparts did is insulting to their intelligence. The director and writer does not go to any lengths to attempt to make it seem possible either.<br/><br/>Characterizaton is also changed, but whether it was really the writing at fault remains to be seen. The lines are almost always taken directly from the play, but atrocious acting could easily have twisted it. It certainly exists in large amounts. By far and large, the cast is horrible, with extremely overrated and miscast Dicaprio and Danes at the helm. Both resort to overblown and soap operatic acting to convey the emotional turmoil of their characters, and neither do it well enough to merit anything but a laugh.<br/><br/>The film is nothing if not imaginative, however. The cinematography is gorgeous, and many shots whimsical, lavish, and inspired choices on the director's part. However, this distracts from the dark, morbid tone of the story, and rather than complement it, it only makes the film lose impact during the important scenes. The director also uses gratuitous shots of Christ and crosses and wide shots to emphasize drama, but only manages to come across as full of himself in a Neon Genesis Evangelion-esquire move.<br/><br/>The Breakdown: Cheesy, over-dramatic, with terrible acting to boot. Not even worth a rental unless you're in the mood for a good, long laugh."

","It's a bit late to be reviewing this movie, but I find it an exceptional reboot. Everything about it is on permanent overdrive, as exemplified by the oversaturated setting and terse cinematography. Some people have reviewed this and expressed distaste at Harold Perinneau's portrayal of Mercutio in favour of the 1968 John McEnery. While ""de gustibus non est disputandum"" certainly applies here, I think it's worth pointing out that McEnery's performance brought a certain boorishness and abrasion to the character that Perrineau did not. Romeo, played by DiCaprio, was excellently cast and acted, striking a healthy balance between stunningly handsome and endearingly clumsy and exuberant. And I don't care what all you phonies say, Claire Danes was gorgeous.<br/><br/>Others have derided the film for certain choices made in the staging, combat, and/or nonverbal action, remarking ""Where did Shakespeare write that?"" Well. First, we are already working in a modern setting, so the assumption that historical accuracy in staging and direction should be followed to a T is frankly absurd. Second, the plays are public domain, which is a mixed blessing, as it brought us the 2013 R&J Sparknotes movie adaptation. But with that freedom comes a brilliant opportunity of artistic expression from the director, and each choice of omission or interaction in this production was apparently made with great care to maintain the integrity of the story being told.<br/><br/>To touch on comparisons between the 68 and 96 movies: don't try to tell me Leonard Whiting acted like he had any idea what he was saying. Have you people seen the movie? <br/><br/>This film is definitely worth your time. I find it to be a well-wrought revamping of one of my favourite plays from the Shakespeare Corpus."

I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language, I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that.

"emee4real","1","52","101","30 November 2007"," Oh Please!! The 1968 version is a whole lot better than this crap!
","I can't believe there are people who actually like this version of Shakespeare's play. Or those who prefer it to the 1968 version. The producers who wished to make a ""modern-day"" Romeo & Juliet just failed woefully. Only Leonardo DiCaprio seemed to stand out with his portrayal of Romeo (and that's because he's such good actor); isn't it a surprise that his 1968 predecessor is also named Leonard (Whiting)? But let's face it: Claire Danes was so damned unconvincing as Juliet and very plain too. She is nowhere near the beautiful, talented Olivia Hussey, who wowed the audience with her performance as Juliet in 1968. No matter how you look at it, the part of Juliet doesn't fit her at all!<br/><br/>Also, in the 1968 adaptation, Michael York made me admire the Tybalt character, as he portrayed him with a cool and calm grace that nearly made Tybalt a likable character (even though we know he isn't). Unfortunately, John Leguizamo's Tybalt was so downright irritating and annoying that he made him a whole lot more unpleasant than Shakespeare himself did. There are several issues I find appalling in this flick. In the first place, who says that Tybalt beats up Romeo when Romeo initially declines to fight him? Because Shakespeare definitely didn't. <br/><br/>Secondly, when the bloke who plays Benvolio says ""Part, fools! Put up your swords; you know not what you do"", I'm like ""Swords? What swords? They are using GUNS, not swords"". Why doesn't he say: ""Hey! Put your guns down!""? That would have been more realistic.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Harold Perrineau's Mercutio, unlike that of John McEnery, is simply brash. He doesn't have the wit. And the idea of dressing him up like a drag queen is simply disgusting.<br/><br/>And finally, 4 crying out loud, who said Juliet woke up just before Romeo's death. Didn't the director read the story? I believe if Shakespeare got up from his grave and seen what they had done with his play, he'd call down GOD's curse on the script writers. In short, I was so disgusted with the movie that I wished I hadn't seen it at all. My brother who was watching it with me said he preferred it to the other one because it was ""modern"". He is one of those who believe that the movies made from the 80s backwards (i. e. movies of the 80s, 70s, 60s, etc) are rubbish, but that's his opinion, not mine.<br/><br/>Call me old-fashioned or whatever u like, but here's my verdict: If u are looking for a Romeo & Juliet movie, LOOK FOR THE 1968 ADAPTATION! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE, IT'S BLOODY TERRIBLE!!!"

","Fans of Shakespeare and good movies stay clear.  This is possibly the worst movie ever made.  First off the camera zooms in and out so much you can't tell what's going on, and it's enough to give one motion sickness. This ruins the movie by itself. Second, they do a freeze frame of each actor to introduce each character ala The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  A Sergio Leone movie this is not. Third, the acting is incredibly awful.  Pete Postlethwaite is basically the only competent actor. The cameo by M. Emmet Walsh is blasphemous.  Everyone else deserves to be in this lemon of a movie.  Fourth, there is a music number that made me want to end it all right then and there.  However, this movie has one thing going for it. The script.  It was basically unadapted from the play, however, the way it was visually handled is enough to make Shakespeare roll over in his grave. And over and over and over..."
"Elanor000","1","31","58","26 March 2006"," Don't see it
","Romeo and Juliet... a great story, yes? Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo? Um... no. Overall this is a particularly awful version. First of all, the Elizabethan dialect in the modern setting distracts horribly from the storyline. To see a man with pink hair in a half-open Hawaiian shirt saying thee and thou and other such nonsense is generally not pleasing to the modern audience. In addition, if you didn't know the story, you'd be extremely confused. There are some, well, not plot holes, but very confusing sections. In general the movie shows almost no traces of the fact that the Capulets and the Montagues hate each other. Furthermore several completely unnecessary (and rather disgusting) additions have been made, including a cross-dressing Mercutio. The ""prince of cats"" title attributed to Tybalt is atrociously overdone - he hisses at people. So if you want to see a great version of this classic story, see the 1968 version with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey - a much more satisfying movie."

","I just want to start by saying that I am a boy and I AM NOT A LEONARDO DICAPRIO FAN!<br/><br/>Now on with the review.<br/><br/>I'm 15.  For my ninth grade english class, I am currently studying William Shakespeare's tragic play Romeo + Juliet in both modern and old english versions.  Now I first heard about Romeo + Juliet back in fourth grade when I was 10 years old.<br/><br/>I didn't know what it was about at the time, so I asked my cousin (who was in ninth grade, but graduated in 1999) what it was about.  She told me it was about two teenagers from two feuding families who meet and fall in love. They soon enough get married, but all that ends tragically when they commit suicide.  As a result of their deaths, the two feuding families agree to peace.<br/><br/>Now I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater, so I patiently waited until it debuted on Cinemax a few months after it was released.  Let me just say it was amazing!  I had never seen a more beautiful film.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann's updated version of the play is absolutely stunning.  What really surprised me about it was that it was set in present day Verona Beach, California.  They drove around in cars, instead of riding on horses and instead of fighting with swords, they fight with guns.  All of this was good.  One thing surprised me though, it contained it's original dialogue. Now many films that are updates of the play, don't contain the original dialogue.  <br/><br/>10/10"
"leighwill","8","29","56","23 January 2001"," Very surprisingly very good
","It shouldn't work but somehow it manages to. Most people assume the play will survive an update because it is 'timeless' or 'as relevant now as ever' but that is the reason why modernizing it should be doomed to failure. It's not really saying anything that hasn't already been said. It has almost become a cliché that the theme of the play is as relevant today as it was when it was written. What Baz Luhrmann does is bring something a little different to the story it's bold but that's why it's good. Modern elements are blended almost seamlessly in to the original script. The TV Anchorwoman replaces the narrator, gun play replaces sword play, Verona beach replaces the city of Verona, gang violence replaces family rivalries and other elements like the taking of hallucinogenic drugs and the drag act appear convincingly with the original dialogue as if they were always meant to be there.<br/><br/>Keeping the original script was essential since it is written poetically (people in Shakspeare's time didn't really talk like that) and no one in there right mind would change the words of a poem since that would defy the whole point of it. If the language of the play puts you off watching this I would seriously recommend reading it first to help your understanding. A little bit more work than your average shallow Hollywood money spinner but infinitely more rewarding."

","It wasn't that I hated this film but it certainly didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I don't understand what the purpose was of modernizing this story, especially the way it was done. While certain parts were mildly enjoyable and it was fascinating to see the early magnificense of Danes and Decaprio the movie made no lasting impression on me and some parts just-well they just didn't work.<br/><br/>It would be difficult for me to say exactly what didn't do it for me but I guess it just seems odd updating the story in this way. Great casting, great performances-but the movie left me flat.<br/><br/>I am not sure ""updating"" this movie was a GREAT idea. It was just a tee bit to modernized and though well intentioned was just off a bit. It didn't work quite like it should have. After the movie's done it's just sort of like your left with the feeling ""what was the point"""

","I was first introduced to Shakespeare freshman year at high school.  Sure, it was a bit tough at first, but I got used to it.  Romeo and Juliet was a terrific play.  Then came the time in class when we would watch the video adaptations of this play.  We spent half the period on the '68 version, then half on this one, which went on for a few days.  The '68 version was very well done, and most of the class liked it.  Then we watched the ""new"" one. I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it might be good.  Then I see the Montagues cruising the expressway in an open top convertable.  OK, so it's in modern times.  It might be good.  Then I heard them speak.  Dear God, what were they thinking?!<br/><br/>I see this fight at a gas station where everyone looks like they're on speed and they shout these Shakespearean lines like they're normal for the time. I should've seen it coming when, instead of a narrator, a news caster does the prologue.  Great job.  Tip to the writers: if you're going to put Shakespeare in modern times, don't include the original lines.  ""Draw the sword!""  What ""sword?""  I saw no sword in the movie.  I saw some guns.  Is this what Shakepeare would call guns nowadays?  And do I see news reports and beach parties where people actually speak in blank verse?  And let's not forget Leonardo DeCaprio.  How much more pathetic can his acting get?  I hardly saw any good actors in this movie.  I don't know why people would see this as ""good"" entertainment.  Rarely do I ever give a 1 out of 10 to any movie, but this was just plain garbage.  If you want to see the real Romeo and Juliet, watch the '68 adaptation.  It is much more worthy to be called a work of Shakespeare's."

You can even see young Michael York, who plays a brilliant Tybalt.<br/><br/>This version had me alternating between boredom and anger. I found it pompous and cartoonish. The overall impression was of a sophomore's first attempt at film. Call me old fashioned, but if a director interprets one of the finest theatrical works in the English language, it seems to me that he needs to do a better job than this.<br/><br/>Harold Perrineau did a decent job at Mercutio in the context of a film that just doesn't get it done.

","this film takes the bounds of the unwatchable and stretches them to near-mythic proportions. how a director could start with a play of such stature and end up with such a poorly acted, unintelligibly edited piece of filth is beyond my comprehension. the only thing this flick has going for it is the supporting cast. Pete Postlethwaite is excellent, as always, but putting him on screen with leo's befuddled romeo is a true crime. some modernizations are better left unmade. on the whole, i'd rather sit in the treatment chair in ""A Clockwork Orange"" and be forced to watch ""West Side Story"" for three days straight than be forced to endure a second watching of of this beast."
"aya862001","1","30","63","28 February 2004"," A failure
","This modern version of Romeo and Juliet was actually the most foolish one I have ever seen. The director depended on choosing popular actors and forgot about everything else. I think that his fatal mistake was choosing the setting of the movie to be in modern times. If he had decided that the script would go unchanged and retain the same events as the original play, then he might as well have preserved the setting. Yet he didn't and at the end everything was messed up. It is quite apparent that the problems that faced Romeo and Juliet cease to exist in modern times. First of all Romeo and Juliet come from extremely rich families, when they realized they were in love, couldn't just go to another Italian city or even buy two two hundred dollars plane tickets to Spain and forget about their families.	The film just doesn't present anything contra that solution. Maybe in the older days, some five hundred years ago, girls in Europe couldn't walk out easily out of their family's house, but I presume that his is not the case nowadays. Even if we made the hypothesis that Romeo and Juliet weren't ""that smart"", or if Juliet's family was the only traditional family in Europe  and the events went on in the same sequence, when Romeo was banished couldn't she just go visit him like his church friend did and tell him about her plan?With all those up to date communication devices was the DHL the only choice to report such vital news? Also this banishment in a desert thing seems so stupid. Europe no longer applies this punishment and if it did, it wouldn't be free from security. They prevent people to walk out from cinemas at the middle of films, don't they have the ability to prevent people form walking out of their exiles. And this herbal 24 hour poison that Juliet had taken to make her seem dead, can it actually fool modern day medicine. Would they just take a person who seems breathless and bury him without carefully examining him. What makes matters worse is that she is presented as the daughter of one of the most powerful families, I mean; she should have been examined properly. As stupid as well was the loud monologue Juliet used to make to herself. Mad people are the only ones who talk to themselves. The director could have just transformed such loud quotations into thoughts. Maybe at the time of Shakespeare they didn't have that option, but now they certainly do. As I formerly mentioned mainly I am against the time setting of the film, because the world has changed a lot. But there are other things that were inappropriate for example the people who screamed at each other while holding guns. All I can say is that it is badly done movie. Too little effort was exerted to make it. It took away two sixteenth century family and put them in the inappropriate time and the result was devastating. Everything seemed freaky. The concept behind the Romeo and Juliet tragedy was not conveyed to me through that movie because everything seemed illogical. It certainly was a failure."

"preppy-3","8","14","26","1 July 2002"," MTV meets Shakespeare
","Updating of ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the 1990s. I'm going to skip a synopsis of the plot--everyone knows it. <br/><br/>This is basically ""Romeo and Juliet"" in modern day dress full of arresting visuals, gunplay, loud 1990s music, wild dance numbers with all the cast members using Shakespeare's original dialogue! The effect is odd (to say the least). It ALMOST works. The visuals are all incredible (director Buz Luhrmann always knows how to make a film look fantastic) and the movie almost never stops for a breath. That's the problem--at first it's fun, but after 2 hours you're exhausted. Also the actors seem lost. When they're talking Shakespeare they seem to have no idea what they're saying. Most of them just recite the lines with a blank look on their faces. The older actors (Paul Sorvino especially) are much better at it. The casting and acting in this is all over the place.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio (as Romeo) is a good actor, but he's just all wrong for this role. He looks lost and way out of his depth. However, Claire Danes is wonderful as Juliet. Very sweet, likable and seems to have a clear understanding of the dialogue. Also her reactions in her dancing scene with Paris are hilarious. John Leguizamo is way over the top as Tybalt--too much. He quickly becomes annoying. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino are very good as Montague and Capulet but are underused. Even Paul Rudd is very good (and incredibly handsome) as Paris. He seems to be having a whale of a time in his role.<br/><br/>Also, there is an incredible party sequence and Romeo's cousin comes in a wig, dress and lipstick and no one bats an eyelash. There's a great musical number on a huge staircase also.<br/><br/>Loud, eye-popping, funny and even quite moving. As it stands, I'm giving it an 8. With a better cast I might give it a 10.<br/><br/>Best line: ""Check on me tomorrow and you'll find me a grave man."""
"colonelmonkey","1","18","36","12 December 2005"," Hated it
","This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I didn't like how it was only partially modernized, and the actors couldn't act for soup. Basically it reeked of stupidity.<br/><br/>With Shakespeare, you either have to modernize the whole thing, or not modernize it at all. The combination of a modern setting and the original text didn't work. It was awkward and hard to follow.<br/><br/>The actors didn't seem like the poetic sort. Half the time, Benvolio was shirtless and reciting poetry. None of them had any idea how to read Shakespeare. It was hard to appreciate the text when the actors were completely lacking in realistic feeling. I think that two directors made a bet to see who could make the worst movie with the most highly paid actors. Baz Luhrmann most definitely won.<br/><br/>The whole thing reeked of stupidity, to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. I was extremely annoyed with the subtitles explaining who the people were, as if we didn't already know. The frequent freezes on the ""swords"" and ""daggers"" were totally pointless and wasted time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think you would have been better off watching the Zefferelli version of Romeo and Juliet, which was classy and very accurate to the actual text. I would rather have my fingernails torn out with white hot nail clippers than be subjected again in my life to this horrible mess of badly modernized plot lines, butchered text, and shoddy actors. Out of 5 stars I give it a negative 7.<br/><br/>What were they smoking?"
"zkonedog","5","2","2","2 March 2017"," Chemistry Between Principals Makes This Watchable
","Back in ninth grade English class, our teacher showed us this movie after we read William Shakespeare's famous play. The film made an impression on me back then, and I wanted to see what would happen 15 years later. It isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, but ""Romeo + Juliet"" does manage to render the tale in a bit more of a user-friendly format.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie uses the exact language of Shakespeare's play...but sets it in a modern, urban environment. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) are the principles, of course, while Harold Perrineau & John Leguizamo have important roles as Mercutio and Tybalt, respectively.<br/><br/>What makes this film hold up at least somewhat are the performances by DiCaprio & Danes. They are perfect for their roles and have great on-screen chemistry. Both ended up being fine thespians, so in hindsight this should not have been surprising. Many fans of the Romeo & Juliet story laud the 1968 version as ""top dog"", but IMHO the two principles here, at least, put up performances every bit as good as from the earlier effort.<br/><br/>The reason this one isn't an all-time classic? The direction from Baz Luhrmann is just too weird. I don't understand why they couldn't have kept the urban, modern feel without making things so bizarre. The duels between the houses are terribly over-the-top, while I've never once understood why viewers need to see Mercutio prance around in drag for so long. Even the camera work and cinematography is odd/bizarre. Had they toned down that craziness a bit, this could have rocketed higher for me. As it was, like I mentioned earlier, I really only enjoyed the Romeo/Juliet interactions.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Romeo + Juliet"" is good for showing reluctant Shakespearean ""scholars"" (e.g. high- schoolers), but other than that it is decidedly average. DiCaprio and Danes give it their all, but all the weird stuff going on around them really detracts from the passion of the story. If only they had played it just slightly more serious..."

When this movie came out - the ""teen generation"" ate it up - and Hollywood cashed in on it's success; regardless of the fact that this feature had no depth, class, or innovation.

When you go to the movies you expect something different. Not necessarily better. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that a movie version set in the present day will be different. However, I know for a fact that even if the play had been copied line for line, some people would still not be happy about that.

","Now I like Baz Luhrmann, I loved Moulin Rouge! and Australia was a much better film than people give credit for. However, I was disappointed with this version of Romeo and Juliet. I really liked the 1968 film with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey though that did have one or two problems.<br/><br/>Starting with the redeeming qualities, the film does look amazing. The cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is gorgeous. I also liked how the Capulet party was staged, all grand and lavish and Claire Danes's white swan dress was stunning. Harold Perrineau was perfect as Mercutio yes the singing wasn't great but it was for comedy, and Pete Postlethwaite was a noble and sympathetic Friar Lawrence. Miriam Margoyles is a fine actress and brought a real sense of maternal instinct to the role of Juliet's nurse. Regarding the character though, she could have been developed more, seeing as she was the main source of motherly affection in the play I would have liked to have seen that come across more. Also I would have liked to have seen more of Paris, a smaller role but a significant one. And Leonardo Di Caprio does have a boyish charm that compensates for any thoughts of whether he was too young. I liked how fast it moved too, it was almost exhilarating in pace, and I think the film makers did that purposefully to empathise how rushed Romeo and Juliet's relationship was. Plus the ending is very tragic as it should be.<br/><br/>However, there are other aspects that didn't quite work. I have no problem with a film that is updated, it worked in West Side Story, it worked in Carmen Jones, but it does feel jarring when the script is not modernised, with a poetic and archaic sounding script mixed by exhilarating non-stop action merging on screen it doesn't quite work. Plus when Benvolio says ""Put up your swords"" I personally felt ""put down your guns""(as they were guns not swords here) would have been better. Baz Luhrmann's direction was also a disappointment, sometimes in the early scenes it was so over the top that I forgot I was watching a version of Romeo and Juliet and thought I was watching a flash cartoon. (I love animation don't get me wrong but that feel to this film doesn't bode well with me). The soundtrack I had mixed feelings about. I liked the music at the beginning and in the balcony scene, I liked the use of Mozart's Symphony Number 25 and I liked the use of Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde sung brilliantly by Leontyne Price, however some of the more contemporary songs felt somewhat intrusive. Claire Danes looked gorgeous, but her acting was rather unconvincing in places, her crying for instance felt very melodramatic and (please don't take this the wrong way) reminded me of a spoilt rich girl who cried when she didn't get her way. Finally, I have nothing personal against John Leguizamo though I am not fond of him either, but I thought he badly overdid the character of Tybalt, too much of the tough guy attitude and not enough of the grace and coolness of the Tybalt of the play and the 1968 version.<br/><br/>Overall, watchable but disappointing. It could be worse though, you could be watching that animated film with seals taking the roles of the Shakespearean characters, that did a much worse job at respecting(more like disrespecting) the material. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I have long been a fan of Shakespeare.  It has always amazed me that a person could write an entire play as a series of poems.  The man was a genius.  Modernizing Shakespeare for the teens of today is a good idea - but this movie falls terribly short.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie (I can't believe I watched the whole thing - I guess I thought it would get better), I was thoroughly disgusted.  There are several reasons.  First, the acting itself was terrible, except for John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who did a magnificent job. Leo and Claire both seemed as though they were reading most of their lines from cue cards - there was little if any emotion involved.  This movie also destroyed the true relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, it turns Romeo into a druggie and Mercutio into nothing more than his dealer.  What kid of today who uses drugs would seek revenge for the death of his dealer? None. They would simply seek out a different one.  I can understand trying to remain true to Shakespeare's words, however, there were many times in the movie that doing so did not make sense.<br/><br/>This movie would probably have been much better if it had not used Shakespeare's dialog.  The cast itself isn't bad, but for the most part they did not seem comfortable with the original dialog.

Hey, knock it if you like but I think anything that might get more people reading or appreciating the written word can't be that bad.<br/><br/>Highly entertaining, a heartbreaking romance, and a visual feast, Romeo + Juliet is a movie I've treated myself to at least once a year since I first saw it in '96. After seeing Moulin Rouge this year I watched it twice in a row. A must for any romantics - just keep an open mind and expect the unexpected if you've never seen a Baz Luhrmann film before - you either love or you hate this hopeless romantic but you should at least appreciate what he does."

Sure the words are the same, but there is so much of a difference from reading the book and watching this movie. In the book, it is dull and just seems to overflow with so much crud that is going on. I wish I was back in time watching these plays. The movie puts it all into perspective. Because the book is not descriptive 100 per cent, it is all language. Yeah yeah use my imagination to envision it, but I rather experience another's vision. Their vision might be totally something I would not expect, and it was. This movie was beautiful in images as it was in words. Hell it was all the director had to do because he had all the words already beautifully crafted for him. The interaction between characters was wonderfully displayed. The movie literally jumped out and grabbed my attention. come one gun wielding wild men from opposing sides screaming at each other death threats. How is this not entertaining. Hell how many American's watched the war in Iraq on CNN. This interests us. Whoever casted Mercutio was bloody brilliant. The whole before the ball scene, and the body language was just amazing. His death was something that always makes me love. Not because he died, but because of how it all played out. It was just sheer raw emotion.<br/><br/>The story itself I just pity. Not because it sucks, but the subject matter. Makes me think about love and if it is even worth it. When you see a timeless movie that does not end your way you think about what you would have done. I myself would not change anything, but I am just sad that an honest and true love died. Does it exist in this world? Who knows.. All I know is, I wanted to be Romeo just to be with Juliet! I will safely say this is the best transition from book to big screen I have ever seen..although Sin City was amazing. I wish this movie was easily available when I was in High school studying this play.<br/><br/>Amazing Movie..."

"lukesmith4887","3","8","16","11 April 2010"," Luhrmann creates an overly-elaborate slaughtering of Shakespeare's eloquence
","In Romeo+Juliet, director/producer Baz Luhrmann takes the traditional story of ""two star-crossed lovers,"" puts it in Verona Beach in about 1970, adds his own little motif of water, over-dramatises the whole story, chooses substandard performers, and to top it all, ignores half of Shakespeare's original text.<br/><br/>In one of the first few scenes, through the chosen costumes, Luhrmann takes what was to some extent implied in the text, and makes Mercutio a transvestite homosexual, Tybalt a devil, and, using blatant stereotypes, Juliet becomes an angel, and Romeo a knight-in-shining- armour. Some might call this ""rather cute,"" I call it lack of imagination.<br/><br/>It seems that, however much he tried, Luhrmann could not succeed by himself, and so tried to find people to be successful for him: Leonardo DiCaprio, for example. DiCaprio was one of the small number of cast members who did a half decent job at their role. DiCaprio quite effectually portrayed the romantic, bashful, teenage Romeo, giving the viewer at least some feeling of verisimilitude. Claire Danes, however, removes this feeling by giving Juliet the image of forced emotion. Also, Luhrmann's casting of Miriam Margoyles, using a somewhat Spanish accent, as the Nurse gives a completely different image of the bawdy Nurse that Shakespeare portrayed. Luhrmann avoids the bawdiness by simply skipping over most of those parts of the original text.<br/><br/>The Nurse's suggestive monologues are not the only sections of the text that Luhrmann skips; he also takes out many side plots and events that occur throughout, apparently without realising that some of them do have some import in the story. For example, in the film, Romeo never kills Paris, who, in the text, is yet another one of the innocent victims of the family feud. This may not have a huge effect, but when there are a number of similarly small events taken out, the effects add up, making what is an excellently written story into something much less powerful.<br/><br/>One might think that, having not done too great a job in other aspects, Luhrmann might have done better on his choice of music. Then one notices that music varying from artists such as Garbage, to One Inch Punch, to the Butthole Surfers, can be summarised, quite simply, as melodramatic rubbish. Quite fitting, considering Luhrmann's apparent love of melodrama, as shown through his choices of casting, costume, setting, and music. And that more or less summarises the whole movie: an over-done butchering of Shakespeare's beautiful writing."

","I have no problem with updated versions of Shakespeare.  When I was in college, I was in a production of Merchant of Venice set in the 19th century; and I liked what Kenneth Branaugh did with his 19th century Hamlet. I once saw Coriolanus set in the Confederacy during the US Civil war -- which added quite a bit to the political dimensions of the play.<br/><br/>However, this one is over the top.  When we see ""Sword"" brand handguns -- obviously so the line ""put up your sword"" would make sense -- and having Mercutio be a drug dealer is simply too much.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I could have lived with it, except for two things: Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.  Neither one of these two has a clue about how to speak Shakespearian English.  See DiCaprio with Peter Postlethwaite (Friar Laurence) or Danes with Miriam Margolyes (Nurse).  Both Postlethwaite and Margolyes know the music of Shakespeare, and it is almost painful to see DiCaprio and Danes stumbling.  And putting the balcony scene in a swimming pool is simply stupid.<br/><br/>Also, some of the secondary characters are badly done.  John Leguizamo is a terrible Tybalt, and the limp-wristed Mercutio is ludicrous.  Bryan Dennehy is simply wasted as Montague.<br/><br/>And I would like to inform the script-writer that Juliet wakes up AFTER Romeo dies, not before.

Not only is this version of the play difficult to take seriously, it's paced badly, and most of the acting is terrible.  What Luhrmann has attempted to do is splice hyperactivity together with intellect - and the two don't mix well.  Furthermore, setting Romeo and Juliet in modern times necessarily takes the play entirely out of context, especially when using the original dialogue.  Romeo and Mercutio are particularly misrepresented here.<br/><br/>There are only two things that keep this ""film"" from getting a one or a two from me.  First, the soundtrack is cool (I'm a huge Radiohead fan).  Second, Shakespeare's writing is still genius, even in a misrepresentation like this.

","Romeo+Juliet (1996)<br/><br/>Some Music, but otherwise, Uncommonly Artificial<br/><br/>It is rarely that one comes across this kind of joke, and that is a patronizing statement. This film should be branded as a transmogrification of a gem. Now one would be compelled to compare this movie with Moulin Rouge, the director's more recent, much acclaimed, over rated, effort. In that case, too, he brought the 1950's classic tragedy down to a messy soup. I was inclined to put the technique to the surrealist genre, and now I think that I was being too generous.<br/><br/>But Romeo+Juliet really hits the rock bottom. The drama, transported some five centuries forward, and the whole drama played out of context (the characters, including the TV newsreader, speaking in the archaic language) was funny, to say the least. And, in the maze of modern gadgetry, Juliet's mansion (or any other mansion or shop for that matter) not to have a simple telephone was definitely going too much. This kind of love that cannot spare a few dollars for a cellular phone (and paying for such miserly conduct with death) is unimaginable. I do not think that anyone who is not mesmerised by DiCaprio could in any manner relate to any of the characters or sympathise with them; they are so artificial.<br/><br/>Leaving aside Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968) that was an orthodox version (and quite memorable too), one remembers with much affection The Westside Story, a musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. There the modern social elements were interwoven into the setting so that the result was a recreation of the spirit of the original Romeo and Juliet. I believe even Shakespeare would not have found fault with that.<br/><br/>The only remarkable aspect of this Romeo+Juliet was music. However, a bad concept has never been resurrected by good music.<br/><br/>I only hope that the director would stop desecrating milestones of the past."

","Flamboyant and overly-fashionable director, Baz Luhrmann's breakout film has become a sensation in the world of romance and Shakespeare.

Luhrmann brings the timeless story to the present in such a way that has some people loving it and others hating it.<br/><br/>Taking place in the present, everybody are surfers/punks. It is cool to see Shakespeare being to hip and cool. The guns, cars, music, and costumes really appeal to this generation's teen.<br/><br/>Romeo & Juliet is probably the best known Elizabethan play as well as the best known love story ever told. For those that don't know the plot, Romeo Montague's (DiCaprio) and Juliet Capulet's (Danes) families have always had violent feuds in Verona, Italy. As young teenagers, they meet, fall in love, get married, then kill themselves because each think the other is dead after they wake up with convincing evidence--all over a three day period. People that don't like the story hate how young they are, how quickly they get married, and how easily they commit suicide. First of all, the play is 500 years old. Second of all, that is what Shakespeare wanted people to think about. Kids their age and younger always say they are in love and they want to get married. Don't go saying they are too young to fall in love and get married when that thought crossed your mind! As for the suicide, it fits. Dying to be be with the person you love is the most romantic thing of all. I can't help but feel heartbroken when they die. Aside from that, their deaths were the only way for the Montagues and Capulets to restore peace among themselves and all of Verona. When I first read this play and studied it in high school, I was one of the only people that liked the ending because I thought it just ""fit."" I had no idea why for the longest time. Now I know.<br/><br/>Romeo is regarded as one of DiCaprio's best known roles, but not one of his best-known performances. I would easily say it is in his top five. Everybody else in this is not quite as well known as Leo, but they shine in this and in their other movies. Most of the criticism I've seen from this are from the performances themselves. They say everybody has no idea how to act Elizabethan or how to deliver Shakespeare lines. Roger Ebert said Pete Postelthwaite was the only exception because he was the one that knew how to deliver the lines. Sure he is a talented actor, but nothing is entirely wrong with the performances. The actors talked as if they were thinking it, not with a rhythm. Sir Laurence Olivier was the first actor to break the rule of Shakespeare being rhythmic and natural. So the acting really isn't bad. People were just unused to seeing these Hollywood giants saying things they can't understand.<br/><br/>4/4"

How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme.

As such, the film is hip and sexy, and Old Bill's yarn has much to offer, but while Claire Danes' Juliet is the very picture of grace and innocence, Leonardo di Caprio - undoubtedly a fine young actor - seems out of place as Romeo, and he's upstaged in the good looks department by Paul Rudd as Paris. There's a show-stopping dance number (part of a drug-induced hallucination) at the masked ball where the two lovers first meet, and the second half of the film is powered by a raw emotional intensity, but a truly radical revision of the play might have involved the scrapping of Shakespeare's text altogether and the substitution of 90s dialogue to match the visuals."

Even the Bard was interpreting a place he himself had never been to.<br/><br/>Shakespeare was such a great writer his work can be taken and changed and reworked and reinterpreted in so many ways, yet his writing remains good and true. No other play write stands for such treatment and reinterpreting Shakespeare is the greatest honor that can ever be done to his work.<br/><br/>Shakespeare is always cut and edited. There are many alternative versions of Shakespeare's plays, but we only see one version because for a long time British scholars refused to publish alternative versions (the bastards) and kept them from the public. <br/><br/>This version is loved by so many people, it does everything to try make the characters real to us to our now and true to the Elizabethen theatrical tradition.<br/><br/>Sometimes it fails. The first 20 minutes are generally disliked by audiences, but then the point was to make audience know in no uncertain terms this is not classical Shakespeare. But I think they were trying to hard at the start.<br/><br/>The interpretation of the balcony scene in interesting but it leaves out some of my favourite lines from Romea and Juliet.<br/><br/>The dedication of the actors to the project is fantastic. some reviewers see the the actors as trying to get through their lines as quickly as possible, but when you consider Leonardo Di Caprio when to Australia (flying Coach) to make a video version of the movie to convince studio execs to finance the project.<br/><br/>The scene that makes the movie, the scene everyone remember is Romeo dressed as knight, falling in love through a fish tank with Juliet dressed as angel. One of the most beautiful love scenes every filmed, with no dialog (hence no Shakespearean help).<br/><br/>One of the most interesting films ever. Not perfect, but captures everything I love about Shakespeare. That is blood, sex, violence, bad jokes and so on.<br/><br/>One last point.

Instead they use guns, security cameras, helicopters and cars. You're looking at this and saying to yourself, ""No way! CARS?!"" Now how is Mercutio going to die? If you read the original play he is stabbed by Tybalt (with a sword). In the movie Tybalt breaks a piece of glass and impales him. The funniest scene is the deaths of Romeo and Juliet.

With voice overs, flashes of the city and all those boys with wide open shirts all in the first scene. I was already on the end of my seat. Cars, explosions, guns.....and this is Shakespeare. A classic has been<br/><br/>brought alive to a new generation, making people really understand and respect Shakespeare's writing. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes give excellent performances as the star crossed lovers. Its a film that everyone can enjoy, truly amazing. Baz Luhrmann has done a spectacular job, I think Shakespeare would be envious of this himself."
"Kane-C","6","3","5","28 June 1999"," Modern Shakespeare
","The most popular love story in history, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, converted to modern day sets. The director and writer of the movie decided to handle the conflicts between modern day sets and Shakespeare's original texts with the means of comedy. This was not necessarily a bad idea, since Shakespeare may be somewhat boring at times, and small humorous bits make the movie..well, less boring. But the result was, that Luhrmann almost turned the love story of all times into the comedy of the year. The movie is by no means bad, but it does not have the spirit of Shakespeare's texts. This movie is a disgrace to the original play, but if one is able to ignore this fact, one can see this movie as a brilliant love story. Well, of course it is, it's Shakespeare after all, so the story is exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio shows yet again that he is not just a pretty boy, but he can act, too! His performance is brilliant, and Clare Danes' is amazing, also. So a movie with wonderful acting performances and an exceptional script can't be bad, but there's just a tad too much humor involved, this story does not need that. I can't help myself, I am comparing the movie to the original play, so I think the movie is not that great."
"ash-032","10","3","5","20 January 2002"," What a wonderful update! I loved it!
","I was only about 9 years old when this movie had first been released and I hadn't been able to see it until now. I am 14 now, and I read Romeo and Juliet, the play, for English as most freshmen like me have. I had to watch both versions of the movie as well (the 1968 Zeffirelli version and this 1996 version). As you could probably predict, I enjoyed the 1996 version better, mainly because it is a version I can relate to more. I had to watch it in class and then the following weekend, I went out and bought it because I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>I really don't like Shakespeare at all, and I don't know much about ""how good"" actors are speaking in Old English, but I thought overall, Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were good at it. Cut them some slack, they are both 2 very talented young actors and for this being their first time doing a Shakespeare film, they did pretty damn well if you ask me. Their chemistry onscreen was good, but it could've been better. I'd have to say that the parts they performed their best in were when they met across the fishtank (There was no dialogue, but their faces really said it all. I also thought that was very romantic), and the night before Romeo's banishment from Verona, in Juliet's room. The death scene was a surprising twist from the play, and it put me in tears.<br/><br/>But, I think they should've spent more time on the wedding scene. It felt like that was only going on for 1 minute. What I also didn't like was the relationship between Romeo and Mercutio. Mercutio... a drug dealer? The two were supposed to play best friends but they only seemed like casual acquaintances and ""drug buddies"" in this movie.<br/><br/>The special effects were great, and the music was wonderful. In my opinion, I truly enjoyed this movie a lot. Good acting, and an excellent modern remake on an old classic. This is a movie today's teenagers will enjoy, but if you're older, I would think that you would like the '68 version because it keeps the traditional stuff. (At least my parents liked the 1968 version better). I really think you should go out and rent it. You'll be happy you did.<br/><br/>**********/10"

I'm not wild about ""modern"" settings of Shakespeare, but some have been done very well and have been highly effective. This production does not fall into that class.<br/><br/>For an outstanding film version of the play, see the 1968 Zeffirelli production.

"nitefire-1","1","6","14","21 November 2007"," Wow...
","this movie was terrible. It's the play that has been around for decades, and could quite possibly be one of the most recognized love stories in the history of man. Having said that, it could also possibly be one of the most Boring films ever made and then, they go and make a modernized version of the film?? I don't know weather they meant for this to be a smash hit, or if their intent was to just bore the audience to death. h'm Let's discuss the plot. The film starts off with a street brawl between the two feuding families Capulet, and Montague. The prince soon breaks this up and declares that ""lives will pay the forfeit of the piece"". The film continues on until Romeo meets Juliet at the Capulet ball. After the two lovers meet, and fall in love they decide to plan a secret marriage. But it's not long before their plans are skewed after Romeo is banished from Verona for killing Tybalt, who killed Mercutio  a close friend of Romeos'. The secret affairs and family conflicts in both films eventually lead to tragedy. In the 1968 film of Romeo and Juliet directed by Franco Zeffirelli, the character of romeo and Juliet are played by Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey along with John McEnery as Mercutio, Michael York as Tybalt and Bruce Robinson as Benvolio. The acting in this film is terrible to say the least. Both Romeo and Juliet seemed superficial and immature, and the acting was always either overdone or underdone. I realize that it is a very dramatic style, but it was just excruciating to watch. I found it hard to respect a Juliet that would hide behind the nurse like a toddler, while lord Capulet yelled at her. While some people enjoy this type of acting (pause, look at James) I found that the drama was overdone to the point where it was unwatchable. Despite the fact that I also despise the modernized film, I would certainly recommend the newer film over this one. I don't think the film worked at all.<br/><br/>the end :)"
"Bardcastle","2","5","11","1 August 2007"," visually stunning but badly acted.
","This is Shakespeare for Dummies. While visually stunning and full of action, the acting is sub par at best. Whther this is the fault of the actors or the director I cannot say, but the lines are delivered melodramatically. Apparently these people do not know how to put emotion into their lines without shouting. Furthermore, the way the lines are delivered when not shouted are given with bizarre inflections and accents on words and syllables that blur the meaning of the speeches. As a teacher of literature, I would not recommend this movie. While I believe that Shakepeare can be made accessible to today's youth, especially urban youth, in doing so, this movie loses the original vision: to tell the story well."

"sergicaballeroalsina","9","2","3","11 March 2018"," Baroque drama in a rave party landscape.
","A movie in which this text is faithfully interpreted should be a pretty movie even with eyes closed. We should agree that theoretically there is no better dramatic text than any classic from the pen of Shakespeare. From this I deduce that at least half of the artistic purpose of the film is satisfactorily resolved.
We could discuss its aesthetics although I think that has to do with personal taste.
A wannabe contemporary drama through the post-modern setting of the rave parties landscapes and an aesthetic halfway between cyber-punk and techno of the second half of the 90s that refers to other movies of the decade. In this way it achieves the task of transferring such an important text to those days.
I think that Baz Luhrmann could not have thought of a better way to recreate a paradigmatically baroque play that also containes his so characteristic aesthetic universe.
The simplicity or complexity of the characters can not be discussed either; Only the performances can be questioned, but they develop favorably through the remarkable work of the actors.
Be careful because if you are willing to contemplate the most famous love story in the world in a truly unprecedented environment, this can become one of your favorite dramas."

","This film has the makings of greatness, but falls so short after the first scene. The vibrant visual style and art direction is brilliant and the director handles the updating of the classic 16th century love story almost seamlessly. On top of that, the supporting cast, especially Postlethwaite, Sorvino and Leguizamo are well suited to the roles.<br/><br/>It all falls apart, however, when we are introduced to our leads. Leonardo Dicaprio has proved himself to be a talented actor in such films as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""This Boy's Life,"" but his just isn't him at his best. He tries hard, but he's inexperienced with Shakespeare and can't get himself around the unnatural language and rhythm. Those lines he doesn't mangle he shouts unintelligibly.<br/><br/>Clare Danes gave us a good performance in ""The Rainmaker,"" but is totally uninspired in this role. Her style is flat, and she delivers the lines with as much talent as the average highschooler would in a school production.<br/><br/>The director had what could have been a very powerful and entertaining movie, but undermines it with the casting of two singularly unsuited actors in the title roles for the sake of drawing more of the MTV teenage crowd to the box office.<br/><br/>For a better rendition of Juliet, I suggest Olivia Hussey in the 1968 Zeffirelli version.  For a better Romeo, try Gwyneth Paltrow's transgender performance in ""Shakespeare in Love."""
"Lia-74937rs","10","1","1","15 May 2020"," It's What Shakespeare Would Have Wanted.
","I understand why people might not like this movie, but I must respectfully disagree. The script is very loyal to the original play, and the modernized aesthetics are, in my opinion, very loyal to the ever too often overlooked spirit of so much of Shakespeare's work. Basically, it was pop-culture, and it was not drama but melodrama, every production was filled with innuendo and over the top characters. Because of the language and aesthetics of the time, Shakespeare can often feel somewhat boring or stuffy, so a version where those visual aesthetics have been updated to something we today (and at the time the firm was made) understand as over-the-top is somewhat genius, to be honest, it captures the essence of Shakespeare that is so often lost in modernity.<br/><br/>Beyond the (surely annoying) lit analysis, the casting is also great - not even just because of Paul Rudd, this movie also has my absolute favourite version of Mercutio!<br/><br/>All in all I think this movie gets a bad rap sometimes because its a bit more fun and indulgent than most adaptations, but that's what makes it so great!"

","A lot of people are slating it for inaccuracies and the off the wall theming. But for me if you want to see the original story from Shakespeare see a more sober version. I feel both films can exist independant of one another. This is not the play as Shakespeare intended but it is fun and the actors exagerated style and movement means it transcends the old English language barrier. Such that a younger audience can get a better idea of what is going on. I am English and did English at college so I can understand a fair bit of olde English. But so many cannot.

Then and now I was impressed by DiCaprio and Danes, both gave such a believable and intense show of the doomed romance. And yes, in that last scene in the church it is hard not to cry.<br/><br/>Back then, being 18, I was totally impressed and amazed by the movie, coming with the described cinema setting and the fact I was just 18.
Now, almost 25 years later, I watched the movie again last night. Weirdly enogh I got kind of annoyed now by the fact that the wonderful Shakepeare language is a bit, well, stained by the fact it is spoken in slurry American English. I have meanwhile seen English Shakepspeare plays with British native actors, and I guess that's the reason it just bothers me now in the movie as it kind of cheapens the beautiful language and at several times the pronounciation is so bad that it's hard to comprehend.<br/><br/>Another thing is, that these over the top party scenes with all that screaming or the screaming and shooting scenes annoyed me now too. I fast forwarded here and there as the pronounciation was so bad and it was all screaming so it didn't matter anyways.

"alejandrocastrom","8","1","1","20 November 2018"," Great Modern Adaptation of a Great Script
","Scene 5 of Act 1 is one of the highlights of Baz Luhrmann's film adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". Not only is the story well portrayed, but it also has great actors such as the stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes to reenact the characters Romeo and Juliet respectively.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Shakespeare which is why I love it when films that are based on his scripts are able to fulfill his original purpose even if there are some differences compared the original version of the play. This was mostly the case for this scene of ""Romeo + Juliet"" since it followed the same story and language from the original script, however it differed in some key aspects. In general, the film kept some of the essential events from the script since all of the language used comes from the original script and the same events are kept. These were: Tybalt and Lord Capulet's argument and Romeo and Juliet meeting and having a ""love at first sight"" moment as well as finding out they are both from opposite rival families. In this film, all main purposes from Shakespeare's original script are kept even though they are sometimes portrayed a bit differently. For example, the film occurs in a modern context where we see people dressed up in costumes and there is alcohol, drugs, electricity, etc. This doesn't affect Shakespeare's purpose since the only thing that changes is how some of the characters act as well as the general look of the party which is changed mostly due to the context of the viewers such as myself since a halloween party might be more common and relatable for our time. The key aspect of the setting from Shakespeare's script is that it's a party made by the Capulet family which is something that is kept for this adaptation. Another part of the scene which I thought followed Shakespeare's original purpose very well was when Romeo and Juliet see each other for the first time and instantly fall in love. This part was quite different to the original script since they stare at each other for a few minutes and don't speak to each other until after Juliet dances with Paris. This change in the script actually enforces Shakespeare's purpose since it adds on to the obstacles that lie between Romeo and Juliet's relationship. The last part I want to mention from scene 5 is the argument between Tybalt and Capulet. In the original script, the scene begins with Tybalt and Capulet arguing over Romeo's presence at their family's party, with Tybalt finally losing the argument and foreshadowing that his anger towards Romeo is not over with the line ""I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall; Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall"". In the film, this argument occurs towards the middle of the scene rather than at the beginning when Tybalt approaches Lord Capulet who is most likely drunk or drugged given his gestures throughout the conversation. Despite the change of the order, this part of the scene does fulfill Shakespeare's purpose which is to increase the tension between these two rival families and show how this affects Romeo and Juliet's relationship.<br/><br/>I definitely enjoyed watching this adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" because despite being different in many key aspects, it still manages to keep the original purposes of Shakespeare and it works. Perhaps it is not the best movie from a filmmaker's perspective, but for anyone who enjoys the works of Shakespeare and this original play, you will not be disappointed by the adaptation.<br/><br/>(599 words)"

It's not that important, but it's still interesting to see something different with such a popular story. We're even told that the families have a rivalry that's implied to go back to the times of when the original story takes place. It even begins by showing us what happens at the very end. Seeing as how everyone knows how it ends, it's a very clever way of setting it up and it makes for a good movie. ***"
"a_chinn","8","1","1","27 May 2017"," Highly accessible and exuberant Shakespeare adaptation
","Wildly fun adaptation of William Shakespeare's play by writer/director Baz Luhrmann. Changing the setting of Shakespeare's plays for film adaptations isn't a new thing. It had previously been done as musicals, westerns, samurai films, gangster pictures, indie dramas about street hustlers, teen comedies, teen dramas, and so on and so forth, but none of those films brought the exuberance and audacity as this film. Set in a Venice Beach-like setting between two feuding wealthy business family empires, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague and Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, with their star cross lover children, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, in roles that really put their stars on the Hollywood map, at the center of the drama. The film faithfully follows the source material's story and all of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but the dialogue is amazingly accessible and understandable from the actors speaking the lines in a very naturalistic manner. Laurence Olivier was actually criticized in his day for delivering lines in too naturalistic of a manner and not in the traditional more sing-song of manner, which Kenneth Branagh took even further, but this film puts that on a whole new level. Actors here are gangsters, street punks, and thugs and deliver their lines as such, but their words are accessible in a way I'd never seen before that retained Shakespeare's original words. In some ways, it's kind of like Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" where most all of the characters spoke as if they were off the mean streets of Brooklyn. In both cases it served to connect the characters and stories to modern audiences and crate less of a distance between the two. The film also drips of 1990s cool, with a very hip soundtrack and many fashions of the day (with a hint of Elizabethan). The film features a strong cast that also includes Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis- Hall, M. Emmet Walsh, Jamie Kennedy, and a memorable Vincent Laresca. But the real start is Bad Luhrmann, who's combination of visuals, sound, and editing created a film so full of energy and audacity that it stands apart from any other Shakespearian film adaptation and is something truly unique. My only complaint about the film is that the modernization of the story also makes Romeo and Juliet's drama and romance seem overly trite and self important in a way that I found annoying. To the teens and teen audiences, I'm sure their love and feelings are very real and serious and worthy of live & death, but at the same time these are kids and they really shouldn't be taking themselves all that seriously. Leo and Clair might as well be the self important teens from ""13 Reasons Why"" for how overly serious they take themselves. Still, I don't think middle age men were Luhrmann's target audience here (i.e. me), so my criticism is probably not valid (i.e. I'm just being a cranky old man). Still, this is a wonderfully original film that demands multiple viewings."
"tamminenamanda","9","1","1","26 April 2017"," Tragic love story
","Movie review: Romeo + Juliet<br/><br/>Romeo + Juliet is a romantic drama film from 1996. The movie is a modernization and adaption of William Shakespeare's famous play Romeo and Juliet. The movie retained the original dialogue from Shakespeare's play. The film is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as Romeo and Juliet. The film can be best described as a tragic love story, the most famous one of all.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in Verona Beach. Romeo and Juliet are entangled in a lifelong feud between their families, the Capulets and the Montagues. They instantly fall in love when Romeo crashes a party the Capulets are having. The pair is soon married in hopes the marriage will ease the tension between the archenemy families. Juliet's parents try to marry their daughter off to another man, but Juliet loves Romeo. Juliet plans to run away with him, but the plan goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>The story of these star crossed lovers is known to all. I think the movie did a good job at bringing it to the modern era. Some details have been changed from the original story to modernize it, like for example swords have been replaced with guns. I think the changes were a good decision. They make the story more believable and relatable for today's people.<br/><br/>In my opinion the cast of Romeo + Juliet was well chosen and they did the world-famous characters justice. I also like the soundtrack of the movie because it's so dramatic yet modern in a way and thereby suits the movie and its storyline. It would be very bizarre if this particular movie's soundtrack were any less emotional and powerful. I think keeping the original dialogue worked well. What I don't like about the film is that it's sometimes a bit confusing and disorderly, and I'm also not particularly fond of the character of Juliet's mother. I didn't think she really fit into the film.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is very good and I think it did Shakespeare's original play justice. I would recommend it to pretty much everyone.

The parts i like is when Romeo heard about Juliet's fake death and he went to die with her, but when he got there, Juliet woke up and touch his face and he drunk the potion of death. He died and Juliet shot herself.i also like the part when they had a shootout at the gas station. i like the modern time better. They had guns instead of swords and things like that. They also played their parts good and made it seem real. I like how they made the movie Romeo+Juliet that was a good movie. Romeo was strong brave and helpful.

","Romeo and Juliet might be the greatest love story of all times and I do not want to get into detail too much about what it is about in this review - which is my first on IMDb. I would rather like to somewhat share with you the way I experienced it.<br/><br/>Back in my teenage years I saw Romeo + Juliet in cinema twice within a week. It is the only movie I went twice to cinema for. Although I knew roughly what the play was about the story kept me in suspense so much I still had a lump in my throat the day after I watched this movie the first time. To that day I had never been as fascinated by anything and really had to think about this tale for days to come. So it was the first time I got to witness the ""whole"" story and in retrospect it probably was the best version for me. It was magic.<br/><br/>I could identify myself with Romeo - he was like who i wanted to be - exceptionally played by DiCaprio and I fell in Love with Julia - stunningly beautiful, just everything - brilliantly played by Claire Danes. DiCaprio had already been one of my favorite actors before (and after) what I can not say about Claire Danes in general but in that role she was near perfect to me. Other stand-out performances I would like to mention are the strong characterization of Mercutio played by the best Harold Perrineau I have seen while in the part of Tybalt John Leguizamo excels himself either.<br/><br/>The settings and direction of this movie are plain fantastic from my point of view. Along with the contemporary interpretation of Shakespeare's genuine play Baz Luhrmann managed to create a pretty special atmosphere that feels surreal, menacing but at the same time highly appealing. Without the original lyrics used in this adaption I could imagine Romeo + Juliet to be an absolutely intoxicating flick but the dreamlike poetry propel it's atmosphere to another level.<br/><br/>I like movies to tell me an interesting story in the first place and showcase it the way it feels right. To this day no other movie could outreach the impact Romeo + Juliet had on me. The first Love usually is the deepest and there is nothing perfect in this world except for true Love.."
"Red-125","9","1","1","19 June 2014"," The movie that made Claire Danes a star
","Romeo + Juliet (1996) was directed by Baz Luhrmann. Luhrmann is know for his cutting-edge approach to filmmaking, and R + J is no exception. He's updated the setting of Shakespeare's play from Renaissance Verona to contemporary Verona, Florida. However, he's kept Shakespeare's language. Other directors have used the same technique, but I haven't seen a Shakespeare play in a modern setting that is this loud, this noisy, and this filled with primary colors. It's a determinedly modern film, despite the language.<br/><br/>To make this concept work, Luhrmann needed the right actors. Leonardo DiCaprio did well enough as Romeo. He was 21 when the film was made, and still had a slender, youthful charm. I think he should keep his day job, though. I'm not eager to watch him play Shakespeare on the stage.<br/><br/>By contrast, Claire Danes is the perfect Juliet. From the minute we set eyes on her, we say, ""This is Juliet."" Danes portrays both the strength and vulnerability that define Juliet. (We tend to think of Juliet as a victim, and she is. However, she's not just a victim. She's a tough, tenacious young woman who struggles fiercely against tremendous odds, and almost wins.)<br/><br/>Danes was only 16 when R + J was shot, but she was already a seasoned actor. However, it was Luhrmann's film that made her a star. After that, there was no stopping her. I believe she would be extremely successful acting Shakespeare on the stage. Think of her as Lady MacBeth. Danes could goad a husband into killing his king, and she would make everyone in the theater believe that she could do it.<br/><br/>The other actors in the film ranged from competent to excellent. I would single out the outstanding work of Harold Perrineaus as Mercutio. When he says, ""A plague on both your houses,"" he makes you understand that he means it.<br/><br/>R + J has a modest 6.9 IMDb rating. My guess is that it was too old-fashioned for people who wanted a traditional action film, and too wide a stretch for people who wanted classic Shakespeare. I think the movie deserves more than 6.9, and I recommend it. <br/><br/>This is a film that will work much better on a large screen than a small screen. Police helicopters, and views from helicopters, will lose some of their power if not seen on a large screen. On the other hand, the film is noisy and drenched with color. If that's not to your taste, the movie might work better on a small screen, where you are somewhat removed from the immediacy of the action.<br/><br/>If you don't like Shakespeare, or if you don't like modern-version Shakespeare, here's my suggestion. See the film, and fast forward through the scenes that don't include Juliet. When Claire Danes is on the screen, watch carefully."

","This is a neat modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic and tragic tale, Romeo and Juliet, where the feuding families of the Montagues and the Capulets are foretold in the Italian city of Verona. The lives and affair of star-crossed lovers Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet are complicated by their feuding families.<br/><br/>Though set in modern times, this movie still follows Shakespeare's play somewhat to a T, helped by the actors' theatrical delivery of the original dialog, the intense drama and the enchanting story. Director Baz Luhrmann did a great job putting together the movie, placing his own unique style into the play but retaining the original intent of the story. The entire setting and scenery are set in this very wildly multi-colored atmosphere, giving the movie a very hip element.

","William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name. It was directed by Baz Luhrmann and it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles.The film is an abridged modernization of Shakespeare's play. While it retains the original Shakespearean dialogue, the Montagues and the Capulets are represented as warring business empires and swords are replaced by guns.Some of the names were also changed. Lord and Lady Montague and Lord and Lady Capulet were given first names as opposed to the Shakespeare original where their first names are never mentioned, Friar Lawrence became Father Lawrence, and Prince Escalus was renamed Captain Prince.Additionally, a few plot details unimportant to the grand story arc were shifted; most notably, Juliet awakens just as Romeo poisons himself and the two see each other before he dies and she commits suicide.<br/><br/>The movie was able to keep the integrity of Shakespeare's text.Credit goes mostly thanks to the actors speaking the very same lines of iambic pentameter as written four centuries ago.Despite a flawed start, Romeo & Juliet proves the story deserves an adjective often attached to it: timeless.The only thing about it is when the filmmakers decide to jazz it up with crazy camera angles and rapid cutting for great visual and when it updates the story for modern times with screaming and shooting, it just gets lost somehow.But still,it remains good for viewing."

","I'm not sure what I was expecting when I began to watch this movie. Perhaps I still had in mind the 3 other Shakespearean films that I loved - and understood. That love ended here. While I appreciate what they were going for in this - probably to make high school kids enjoy it more (I'm a Much Ado about Nothing fan myself). However, the attempted mixing of modern day Verona and Shakeespearean language just don't seem to mix. While in any other setting (almost) the language might seem deep, perhaps difficult to follow,yet in this movie it just seemed insincere, and very stiff.

"tmpj","3","1","1","12 September 2010"," Worse than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""....
","I understand the basic motive of the producers of this thing-a-ma-bob, based on the work of Shakespeare, who based his upon other works of the period. It was a grand effort, but it fails miserably. To update this classic story to modern, hip-hop times and still keep the Elizabethan English in the script is a sort of a death warrant in and of itself. It is clumsy, corny, and a bit superfluous. It stumbles over its own two left feet. I suffered through one viewing of it, praying that it would soon be over. After what felt like an eternity, it finally was over. I would never want to sit through this movie again. It lacked character, substance, and credibility. Plus, there is a great deal of otherwise terrific talent wasted along the way. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino would be worth the price of admission alone, were it another, more credible vehicle. But they come off looking like fools in this play in search of an identity for itself. Leonardo does the best he can to make this thing work, but...terrific actor that he is...he simply does not have the depth to pull this one off. The direction was fast paced and intense, and that was one of the problems with it. The actors had no real opportunity to let the characters come to life and to allow the script to breathe. The result...it moves at too quick a pace, it never quite settles in, and the actors sound as if they are reciting their lines, as opposed to allowing the lines to be delivered at a credible, believable pace. The modernization of the story is also a sore point. To bring this story into the age of greed and moral degradation tends to over shadow the point...that this is a story of love and of just plain rivalry between two families that do not see eye to eye. Romeo and Juliet pay the price for the foolish attitudes of their families, a situation that rings as clear to-day as it did way back in the days of old. The producers wanted to take the story a step beyond ""West Side Story"", which was also a variation on the Romeo/Juliet tragedy...but it failed in this modern day translation. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was badly done because it had virtually no budget, and dealt with the death of a principal cast member during filming. This one had the budget, but it was still badly done, badly written, and badly executed. Maybe another production company will undertake the mantle and do a more respectable job."
"PlutonicLove","Null","1","1","15 April 2004"," Shakespeare as Served by Taco Bell
","William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' has been performed and adapted countless times, and, unfortunately, most of said adaptations have been utterly unable to arouse more than fleeting interest in our current young generation. Consequently, I have to admit that my anticipation for this new interpretation by Baz Luhrman was restrained and, in fact, even somewhat pessimistic. Still, as an antidote to the banal merriment of the Christmas season, during which the film was initially in release, it serves well.<br/><br/>The modern setting, though at first glance somewhat unsettling and irritating, anchors the interpretation of Shakespeare's romantic tragedy in a context familiar to the actors and audience. The acting is unexpectedly robust, considering the fact that a majority of the actors are in fact not (or at least weren't at the time) theatrically trained. One cannot but wonder if passion of such intensity was ever known by any of these plucky teens, these tumbleweeds in the desert of drama. The set and costumes are harmoniously combined and very worthwhile, within the context of a modern rendering. And the set design, too, is immensely resourceful, if not immensely successful. The costumes demonstrate a primal polarity of colors to differentiate the opposing forces as they tear asunder the dramatic passion binding Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>Indeed, just as the spirit of Johann Sebastian Bach gives life to lifeless digital sound canvas, so can the spirit of Shakespeare illuminate any shadowy modern context. 'Romeo and Juliet' is a treasure that benefits the world of the dramatic arts by transforming the detached audience into emotional participants. Yes, 'Romeo and Juliet', like Taco Bell, appeals to those seeking spicy freshness in a context of rapid deployment!<br/><br/>In case you haven't noticed, the above paragraphs contained generous portions of sarcasm. In actuality, this adaptation is a dull, botched one, a far cry from say Franco Zeffirelli's stunningly erotic version.<br/><br/>Updating the plays of Shakespeare has obviously occupied the minds of many directors before, but it is a good idea to try to occupy the minds of the audience as well. After all, while this is not the Bard's best play, it unarguably contains his best poetry; that is because the play is also about language, about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. Hence, this may be one of the hardest Shakespearean plays to adapt to a modern setting. In part this may be due to the dramatic asides, which broadcast private remarks for all to hear, except the target of the remark, but even more importantly the play suffers from another blessing, which is also a curse: the enormous power of the story itself. Any failure to do it justice is likely to be perceived as monumental. Such is the fate of Luhrmans's film, a poppy and incoherent music video mess. The cast's endeavors to render the Bard's language more relaxed and informal are disastrous, as are the countless Mexican standoffs and gunfights that replace the swordfights of the original play. Danes and DiCaprio are utterly lost here, as is any semblance of sense or continuity. Rather than immersing the audience, the MTV style quickly becomes dull and extremely distracting. Ah, but tell that to the teenyboppers, to whom this thing is basically critic proof! To attempt it is to carelessly stroll into a hedonist orgy in Birkenstock sandals, step on every single bare foot, imbibe all half-finished glasses of Maraschino liqueur, smoke a La Gloria Cubana and engage people in tête-à-tête concerning the European Monetary Union - very silly. They'll just look at you all googly-eyed and inform you that `Leo is sooooooooo hot!'<br/><br/>Bah!"
"Jeremy-4","Null","1","1","16 August 2000"," What's That Whirring Sound?
","Updating the plays of Shakespeare has occupied the minds of many filmmakers, but it is a good idea to try to occupy the minds of the audience as well. Baz Luhrmann's loud, brash and irritating adaptation is possibly the most pathetic attempt at updating the Bard I can remember. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...<br/><br/>The basic setting doesn't really work beyond the most surface level, although using a newscaster as a narrator is a good idea. The casting is utterly bizarre, with Danes displaying all the talent of a jar of water, Postlethwaite miscast as a priest, and Margolyes overacting horribly. The decision to make Mercutio a drag queen make so little sense that I wonder if I'm still watching a 16th century play, and the whole enterprise is horrendously overdirected. The cross motif gets so out of hand that by the end we have a gross of them in a single shot, the storm is an unoriginal device, and is badly matted, as are the shots of family names on the tops of buildings.<br/><br/>I can't begin to imagine why so many people like this film, although at least they are getting more out of it then I am. If you want a good Shakespeare update, try Richard III (1995). As for this, I wasted two hours of my life, which I'm not getting back, on a film that disappears up it's own backside faster than a jet-propelled enema."
"TMC-4","Null","1","1","19 September 1999"," A Flim That's Hard to Take
","I just found this film to be pretentious and at times untentionally funny. What really makes Romeo + Juliet hard to take is scenes which consist of the dialog being delivered via shouting (unintelligibly). Not only can the overacting be able to garner in some laughs, it's certain scenes that almost feels like something out of a sitcom like for example, the balcony scene (which here takes place in a swimming pool).  Also, the camera work is often bungled here.  Certain areas in Romeo + Juliet are either overblown (like a car chase a one point), incredibly cartoonish, or incorporate unnecessary imagery.  A perfect example of scenes consisting of unnecessary imagery, is a scene which consist of a character picking up a gun (pondering weather or not to kill themself).  The problem with that particular scene is that the camera work incorporates blurry, slow moving, imagery which not only is distracting, but also (if you look further into it) makes a sensation out of suicide.  And speaking of areas in the film that can use a deeper examination, I somehow get a feeling that there's some hidden fascinating with the Roadrunner cartoons e.g. the opening montage which consist of everything moving at a fast pace before there's a sudden freeze frame and we're soon introduced to the characters (just like in the cartoons) and a scene in which a character speeds out of a bedroom as if they were the Roadrunner.  I just think that the style in Romeo + Juliet gave the notion that if it wasn't for the camera work, the people behind the film would belive that you would just get bored."
"doc-55","5","1","1","12 August 1999"," It was a pretty good idea gone sour
","The play has been updated many times into contemporary or historic environments, often successfully as in West Side Story. The setting in southern California and once again conencting it with contemporary conflicts was a legitimate approach to the play. The language should have been updated as well, as has been done by a number of scholars. Using what was essentially Shakespeare's original text, while well-intentioned, created what I saw as the film's downfall. The young actors were just not up to the demands of Shakepearean dialogue. The production values were outstanding. It was a pretty good idea gone sour."

","As someone who enjoyed the original film and thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, my honest opinion is that this version fails miserably no matter how you look at it. If it was meant to appeal to those who know and love the story (myself included) then in my opinion it fails because of the attempt to bring it into the present day. <br/><br/>If on the other hand it was meant to appeal to a younger generation and to perhaps introduce Shakespeare to a whole new audience then it surely fails on the grounds that the original script is kept despite the modern day setting. Do both, or do neither. <br/><br/>For me, and for both my son and daughter, this was a film that was a real struggle to get through.<br/><br/>Short and sweet, but honest."

If one has some issue with the work I wouldn't think it wasn't the time frame but rather the archaic language. This piece of trash gets it 100% incorrect. How can anyone be expected to find this combination useful is frankly beyond my ability to reason. Whatever possessed such a fine cast to be involved with this project is the question. Perhaps Claire Danes was too young to have a reputation strong enough to turn down this role, but no other actor in this garbage of a film has that excuse to fall back on. If you enjoy Ms Danes get a hold of her fantastic, and too good for TV, series ""My So Called Life"". I like John Leguizamo as much as anyone I believe, but casting him as an Italian stretches my imagination well past it's ability. In an act of delicious irony he dresses as a Puerto Rican for the ""ball"". Funny! I could only make it through 40 minutes of this film.

I can't get over how clever and brilliant this movie was done. Everything from the casting to the cinematography blows me away. John Liuguizama as Tybalt was just insane. He played the hell out of that role. No one could have done a better job than he. He prowled on the screen, like the Prince of Cats that he is and all eyes were on him.I also really dug the fact that both set of kinsmen were totally different from each other. The Capulets were dark haired, Spanish looking men-reminded me of gang members in east L.A. and the Montagues were fair-skinned and kinda punk rock looking. Stark contrasts to each other but equally as deadly with words and weapons.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe has always been the casting of Claire Danes as Juliet. I always felt that Juliet should be physically stunning-my choice would have been Keira Knightly. But, she did balance both the innocence and impulsiveness of a lovesick teenager with the heartbreaking realism of true love and romance.So, I guess she was OK. DiCaprio really was the star of this movie. His intensity, passion and tenderness shone brightly from beginning to end. The last scenes in the church between Romeo and his wife at her""wake"" are the most beautiful, sweet, loving shots on film. Especially when he puts the ring back on her finger- so raw and pure. There are so many other things I could say about this movie-but it is kind of hard to put it all in words. I'll just keep those to myself.

","In modern day Verona, two large-family owned corporations battle each other in the board room -the Montagues and the Capulets.  This family feud has overspilled into the streets where bloody gang warfare is barely controlled by a police force unable to arrest the members of those most powerful families.  In the middle of this violence is Romeo who is sad for lack of love.  When he and his friends gate crash a Capulet party he meets the beautiful Juliet Capulet and the two fall in love  even though her father is arranging a most profitable political marriage to the Governor's son. Romeo and Juliet are married in secret but their love is fated to be engulfed in the violence of their surroundings.<br/><br/>In the past so-many years Shakespeare adaptations of one form or another are more common place for the teen market (think O or 10 Things I Hate About You).  However even now the filming of an update of a Shakespeare tale, using the original dialogue (more or less) would be an incredible risk  as it was then.  This could easily have lost those who love Shakespeare (because of the modern setting) but also alienated the teens by using language that is difficult to follow.  Also Luhrmann's hyper stylised direction is also so very OTT at times that it risked turning the whole thing into a cartoon.<br/><br/>However, it actually works.  The film opens on shaky ground  the first 10 minutes pass by before you are allowed to settle into the film and see how it plays.  The actual opening is a great introduction and works well  with the heavy music, sweeping cameras and the introduction to the main players. However the confrontation between the Capulet boys and the Montague boys at a petrol station is too hyper and silly and risked losing the plot if it were to continue like this.  Happily this scene is the height of Luhrmann's directive flamboyance and, although there are touches, it never gets this frantic again.  Once the film settles the lines work very well and the film really does a great job of setting old fashioned terms (dagger, sabre, sword) in modern ways  even replacing characters like Father Friar with a postal delivery service called Post Haste!<br/><br/>The performances support the film  if they can't deliver the lines convincingly and create modern characters then the film is lost. Fortunately the majority of the cast deliver their lines well  not always following the OTT direction to get OTT delivery.  DiCaprio is soft in the lead yet does well with the traumatic scenes towards the end.  He even looks a little too young for the role of a young lover but it still works.  Danes is almost as good but is less convincing in the more extreme emotions.  The pair work well together  my favourite moment being that when they catch eyes mid-death towards the end.  For once Leguizamo's cartoon antics almost suit the role and he gives a bearable performance  I can't stand the guy so that's saying something.  The best support came from Perrineau Jnr who was given the indignity of being in drag for a bit of the film but delivers his lines well.  The support include mostly well known faces and the only weak links are the actors playing the Montague boys (including Jamie Kennedy).<br/><br/>Overall this was a very brave film and it is easy to look back now and think it must have been a sure thing.  The modern setting is used well once the frantic direction slows down a little bit 15 minutes in and a mostly talented cast make the lines sound alive.  Not a perfect film but a great updating of a classic tale."

","`Romeo and Juliet', but with gangs.  How audacious.  How cleverly handled. I refer, of course, to `West Side Story', which didn't pretend to adapt Shakespeare, but rather adapted the same basic story that Shakespeare himself adapted when he wrote the play.  For you can't have it both ways. You can cut yourself adrift from Shakespeare, force yourself to tell the story from scratch, and take a genuine risk; or you can create another performance of the play itself, in which case you will have to pay more than cursory attention to it.  For instance, if Luhrmann had re-read the play, he would have noticed that it is set not in modern day Florida but in Renaissance Italy.  Oops!<br/><br/>This modern fashion for being counter-suggestible is now very old and more tiresome than it ever was.  Can you really imagine Shakespeare sitting down and saying, `I've written this rather neat tragedy about two people called Romeo and Juliet, but I can't decide on a setting.  Modern-day England? That's not a bad idea.  The moon?  That, too, is feasible ... Ah, what the hell, I'll use Italy, but that's just my preference: do what you want.' More offensive still is a Shakespeare with this frame of mind: `Having written Romeo and Juliet, I notice that I've set it in the past.  THAT was a foolish mistake.  Young people these days are much too stupid to understand anything set in the past - but they'll surely watch the play if I make a big deal about how hip and trendy I am, and if my characters are dressed in the latest fashions. So, with just a few trivial changes ...'<br/><br/>This is an outrage.  Everyone does it these days, and has for decades, but that doesn't make it any less of an outrage.  It just makes the pretence of originality harder to take.<br/><br/>P.S.: I really ought to disclose the fact that I haven't seen this film; and, of course, I never will.  Some might say this is a reason not to comment on it.  I agree in general.  But if a movie is a bad one, then surely there is SOME way of finding out about this, other than by watching it?"

I could hardly believe how terrible it was, the cover itself said it all. (Keep in mind I bought the Music Edition) On the cover it showed Romeo in a vacation shirt, much like the Hawaiian style that business men wear on casual Fridays, it showed Juliet in a dress with wings. Shakespeare never intended for it to be this bad. There were no daggers or knives at all, zero, absolutely nothing. Yet there were guns.<br/><br/>I understand that this was supposed to be a modern version. However! Manuta is a city, not a trailer park, and the priest didn't send off the letter to Romeo, his squire did. Yet, a FedEx style man is shown knocking on Romeos trailer door, not getting any answer and leaving a note in Romeos mailbox. It then shows that the pries goes to FedEx (or whatever its called) and resending it.<br/><br/>The only reference it makes to the original story line is the poisons, and even that is total bullshit. True Juliet drinks a poison to appear dead and also true Romeo drinks a poison to die, BUT, Juliet wakes up and touches Romeos face and THEN he downs the poison. Also she is in a cathedral on a bed type thing when she is supposed to be laid to rest in a tomb (I don't think thats the right word) with all her dead family members.

Shakespeare Retold did so and that was why that series worked, but the only reason this movie seems to exist is to appeal to a more shallow audience without any intellectual value whatsoever. <br/><br/>What I especially hate about this adaptation is not only how it pays more attention to the romance than it should do the feud between the families, but none of the actors look like they know what they were saying. Lurhmann certainly doesn't, which is made clear when he twists Mercutio's Queen Mab speech from a monologue about the challenges and temptations of lovers to a speech about drugs. If a director can't understand Shakespeare, or even has the nerve to twist his poetry that way, then he shouldn't take on that play in the first place.<br/><br/>The actors are vapid, the direction is awful, the editing is terrible, the setting is tacky beyond belief, it's unnecessary and it's just plain insulting to Shakespeare's text. <br/><br/>My only hope is that Baz Lurhmann pays more attention in English class before he takes on another classic.

I was even looking forward to it. And then, I watched it. Shakespeare's play is a classic for a reason-- this movie was put together as if it was a last minute project for an English class. The setting is completely updated-- Romeo now has a handgun, Friar Lawrence has a cross tattooed on his back, the Capulets and Montagues engage in a gunfight. And yet, they use dialogue from the original play! The setting LOOKS modern, but the speech sounds 16th century. Now, I would not have been bothered by this, but for one other thing. THE ACTORS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RECITE Shakespeare! When DiCaprio recites his lines, he does so halfheartedly and monotonously-- as if he was saying, ""Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm in love with this girl now. What a waste of an hour. Can I just poison myself already???"". Only one character recites the Shakesperean dialogue well-- Friar Lawrence. If that was not enough, the screenwriters take delight in butchering a classic. Several key moments were omitted, such as the slaying of Paris. Mercutio, instead of being witty, is now just plain annoying. He, too, does not know how to speak Shakespeare. In short, it is an assault on the eyes, the ears, and the brain.

No, I am not some British Shakespeare fanatic who disregards any modern adaptation of this play as pure garbage-- I am an American teenager who was just hoping to see a good movie. First of all, the opening sonnet which so famously begins with ""Two households, both alike in dignity...etc."" is given to us by some nobody news anchor in a television. It isn't even said by the prince, who traditionally gives the speech. Anyone who says that the dialogue is the same as in the play is clearly mistaken. There are screwed up lines all over the place, different characters give different lines which result in major plot holes. The opening scene couldn't even be understood because of an absurd amount of gunshooting and screaming. I couldn't even understand what was going on, despite the fact that I had just gotten through re-reading that scene from the play. They cut huge amounts of the play out of the movie which were important to set up following scenes. The balcony scene SUCKED. It shouldn't even be called the balcony scene, you know why??? Miss Juliet was not on the balcony...at all! We are expected to believe that our little Romeo (poorly played by Leonardo Dicaprio) is standing five feet behind her and she doesn't notice him. It's complete absurdity that draws any seriousness out of the film. The whole suicide scene was also a bunch of rubbish. Before Romeo has even died, he sees that his love has awaken and he gets to give her his final goodbye and realize the mistake he made. For all of you history buffs out there--that is NOT supposed to happen. And then we find ourselves at the end, at the edge of our seats just DYING for it to be all over. During the last scene the Prince, (who is supposed to read the closing sonnet) screams at the top of his lungs, ""all shall be punished! all shall be punished!"" can you say plot hole? five minutes later in the closing sonnet (read by the annoying news anchor woman) we hear ""some will be pardoned, and others punished."" it basically says that some wont be royally screwed like some other characters. but that line totally contradicts what the prince had said five minutes before. especially considering he was supposed to be the one saying it! i guess what I'm saying is that this movie is TERRIBLE, even if it wasn't an adaptation, it was really just....stupid. and i pity anyone who has to bear watching the entire thing straight through."

Some people may say this is artistic and staying true to the original play but in my opinion it just seems to clash with the modern setting. That brings me to another point, plot holes. Yes it's one of the most amazing plays of all time, supposedly, but that doesn't mean there aren't plot holes. While it's hard to find them in the original play, they're easy to locate in this version. For example, Friar Lawrence sends a UPS Priority Mail Package to Romeo out in the desert. Not only could he have tried to call Romeo, seeing as how nearly everyone in America had phones, but he sends the Package containing the letter possibly hours after Juliet has taken the potion. Even with Priority Mail, the package would have taken a while to get there.<br/><br/>Then there are the characters. Listening to the actors I noticed something. Every single line seemed forced. It didn't flow fluently and half the time they just rush their lines as though they're just trying to get it over with. Why? Because Baz Luhrman decided that it would be a fantastic and wacky idea to keep the original dialog intact. I swear, I hope this guy dies like Steve Irwin.<br/><br/>The audio for this movie was phenomenal, especially the chase scene at the end. That's the only good thing i can think to say about this film. The amount of time put into some scenes is just agonizing. We get to see Juliet dancing with Paris but we never hear any dialog from Romeo. This scene seems to last forever if only because nothing happens. If they just edited it out nothing in the movie would have changed.<br/><br/>If you ever need to see an awesome film from the 90s that has some ""Wacky"" ideas, a good sound track, great acting and characters you'll never forget, go pick up Pulp Fiction instead.

The film looks impressive, with accomplished set and costume design, but not for a moment does this feel like Shakespeare. You cannot take 16th century dialog and give it to contemporary character types played by talentless actors, it sounds dreadful.

Quite simply, Romeo + Juliet is one of the worst movies ever vomited upon this Earth, and it completely defecates on any and all aspects of William Shakespeare's classic play. Let us begin the dissection, then:<br/><br/>I must stress how mind-numbingly stupid it is to make a modern, teenage romance/drama (especially an adaption of such a classic piece of literature), and keep in all of the 16th century dialogue. It's bad enough that they made it so nauseatingly queer in the first place, but that's just before you hear any of the characters talk. I shouldn't even have to waste time on why keeping the 16th century dialogue was a monumentally suck-tastic idea, but I'll just say that it makes everything incredibly awkward and messy. This is also partially due to the fact that they replaced the swords and daggers with loaded pistols, which look absolutely ridiculous in context with the storyline and plot. Also, what the hell is up with the characters walking around in Hawaiian button up shirts and khakis? Is this a joke?<br/><br/>The acting is...how to say this...awful. The actors on display might be talented, but you'd never know it from this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is extremely over the top and fake, and he manages to craft a marvelously whiny, intolerable little brat out of what was once a passionate young man stricken with tragedy, and he very much succeeds in making me want to murder him with a toothbrush in the most violent way possible. The other characters here are a bit closer to their original counterparts, but the acting is sub par and reeks of what you'd expect from a C-level porn flick instead of a romance drama.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a travesty of modern art, and Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave now. It's a testament to this film's stunning banality when I say the only movies that I've ever seen that were worse, were subhuman B-horror movies. This is truly the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life, and I've seen a lot of crappy movies.

","As a teenager who has had a love affair with film all of his life and who is a great admirer of Shakespeare, I must state that Baz Luhrmann's film version of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is one of the most important films of both the 1990s and in Shakespearean culture. It is also a great romance film (think of it as a Titanic for literature enthusiasts). The reason I say that is because it made Shakespeare as entertaining to see in a new generation as it was back in the 1600s. One must admit, that to an average teenager (or person, for that matter), Shakespeare is as boring as reading a tax filing instruction book. With the language and ""iambic pentameter"" (a rhythmic way of speaking with five beats for each line of Shakespeare, which is something conservative Shakespeare scholars hold dear) Shakespeare can sound like clapping with one hand. However, with Baz's creativity and style, R+J is one of the most entertaining adaptations of Shakespeare ever put on film. From the dazzling visuals to the working chemistry between Leo and Claire, Shakespeare is made fun again.<br/><br/>A lot of people knock this version for its extreme over-the-top style and the changing of the simplest elements (changing swords to guns, use of rock music), but to make a hit, that's what you have to do to get your point across. Sure, most of the text is cut and some plot elements from the original is left out, but that does not change the true story by much (you think a teenager would want to sit through the WHOLE play on film?). You have to admit, Shakespeare's not easy to translate to the screen, so one must give Baz a lot of credit for trying and succeeding. Sure its bawdy, violent and over the top, but that's his style. You can't blame a director for using his own style to make an entertaining film. And the way he updates the details to match the era is fantastic (usage of cars, gun handling, Mercutio as a drag queen, Queen Mab as a drug, Prince as a cop, etc.). A lot of people knock the simplest changes, most often touched upon being the swords-to-guns controversy. Think about it: your living in the 1990s, who's going to carry a sword? And while there are wonderful qualities, the negative ones must be briefly touched upon. The language is sometimes spoken without any sort of rhythm at all (I'm not knocking it for not using iambic pentameter, but since Shakespeare is poetic, treat it like it is poetry) and is sometimes spoken as if it were slang. Some of the actors handle it very nicely, and some just crash and burn. I must say, that I bet there were many teens in the audience scratching their heads at what everybody was talking about, but I think it's good for people to listen to movies and not just watch them. One thing I was personally annoyed by was the use of that song ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". It's used once in the first scene, then used again ten minutes later in a scene with the same exact people. Is that all they listen to? Other than that, there are not many negative elements to touch upon.<br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING*Some of the scenes are absolutely spectacular. The gas station scene is wonderfully cartoonish as it mimics a spaghetti-Western shootout, the first encounters between Romeo and Juliet are beautifully done (especially the elevator scene and the pool scene), and the rewritten final scene between Romeo and Juliet is convincing and tragic (and convincingly tragic). I was so into that scene that I was sort of yelling at the screen for Juliet to make a move to Romeo faster in order to show that she's alive. It's little things like those that helps you know how convincing the romance is between the two, and overall it was an extremely powerful and moving scene. The performances from the two are great, as well as Mercutio, Tybalt (who is played by an extremely badass Leguizamo), Friar, Nurse and Prince. This is one of my favorite films, both from the 1990s and of all time, and I hope that in the future, many more people will discover it the way I did."

","This movie was atrocious. The only reason it received a 3 was because of Leonardo Dicaprio. Honestly, what is the point of putting in original dialect? It completely clashes with the modern setting and dress. If my guess is correct, the modernization of the play was to appeal to those of a younger generation, yet, when coupled with the original Shakespearean dialect, the viewers have no way of understanding what the actors were saying. This is the entire reason schoolbook versions have definitions of each different phrase or word that might be misleading or confusing. Claire Danes isn't actually THAT great of an actress, nor pretty enough to put beside Leo as the leads. This movie is a complete disappointment and you should never ever watch it if you know what's good for you."

"pyrocitor","5","2","4","7 April 2005"," Beach boys speaking Shakespeare... how weird is that?
","William Shakespeare's classic play is updated to a modern context, but still using the original, Old English text. It's a bold move on the part of director Baz Luhrmann, who brings a hyperkinetic, choppy editing style to the film, as if to never let the viewers catch their breaths. And for the most part, using the modern day context works, helping to clarify what some of the more tricky lines actually mean by showing it in familiar circumstances which audiences can identify with.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the relationship of the two lovers, who were doomed not to last together is the focus of the movie, neither lover gives a very strong or charismatic performance. DiCaprio makes a good enough Romeo, although he seems to be content to coast along on his looks and fame, and doesn't invest much energy into creating a well developed character. Claire Danes is miscast, and out of place. She makes a dull, uninteresting Juliet, putting next to no energy into the role, as if she would rather not be there at all. She seems to struggle delivering her Shakespearian lines, not to mention giving little sense that she has any idea what she's saying at all. It's sad that the lovers, the center of the film, couldn't find a way to act more enthusiastic and involving. Because so much of the movie focuses on their drab relationship, the film drags in many parts. (although Luhrmann seems determined to throw in a gunfight after every intimate scene just to stop audiences from nodding off in their seats)<br/><br/>The supporting characters are where performances improve, letting the scenes with characters other than the two lovers present much more interesting. John Leguizamo makes a wonderfully vicious Tybalt, yet has the insight to occasionally give an uncertain look in the midst of cheap fighting and evil deeds, as if he is unsure what he is doing is morally right. Pete Posthlewaite is a high point of casting; his gruff but kind Friar Lawrence is wonderfully acted, and he manages to make clear what he is saying, even to those who might not understand Shakespearian dialect. Harold Perrineau makes a flamboyant Mercutio, unafraid of dressing in women's clothing to attract attention, or go on a twenty minute long tirade (that's an exaggeration, but only slightly, Mercutio goes on forever!) without actually saying anything of importance.<br/><br/>It was an interesting idea, and the modern day context for the most part works, helping audiences to identify with the circumstances, even if it does seem a little odd to see beach boys with pink hair and Hawaiian shirts spouting Shakespearian dialog. But Luhrmann's jumpy, incredibly energetic film style, combined with his seeming determination to turn the classic romance into an action movie, with numerous gunfights, gets tiring, and eventually deters more than complements the film. And with two dull, uninteresting performances from the lovers, the focus of the film, it's no surprise that despite Luhrmann's unquenchable energy, the film drags on and fails to retain interest.<br/><br/>-5/10"
"esshor","7","2","4","13 January 2005"," Great movie, classic, needs to be seen
","Romeo and Juliet, helmed by ""Strictly Ballroom""'s director Baz Luhrmann, is the Gen-X-John-Woo-MTV-school-of-film-making interpretation of the Bard's work. From the opening sequence of a television followed by a kinetic in-yer-face staccato of imagery, to the softer ballet-like camera work of the passion scenes between the two protagonists, R&J is definitely cinema of cool.<br/><br/>Instead of being a costume drama set in the 15th century, R&J is transposed to modern-day Verona Beach. However, Luhrmann has also thrown in some anachronistic elements from the original setting of R&J: instead of carrying swords, the members of the houses of Montague and Capulet carry 9mm semi-automatics, emblazoned with brand names such as ""Sword"" or ""Rapier"". Dialogue is faithful to the text in most respects (even the newscasters on the televisions in this anachronistic world speak in Elizabethan tongues). The church plays a prominent role in the modern-day Verona Beach, and the film is replete with religious imagery-- the young Juliet, instead of posters of New Edition on her wall, has a Madonna statue and Victorian images of angels; a large statue of Christ stands overlooking the city of Verona Beach; the guns which the Montagues and the Capulets carry are decorated with images of religious icons. Luhrmann also throws in little references that add some humour to the story: the Romeo 'n the boyz hang out at the Globe Theatre, a church choir breaks out into a hymnlike ""When Doves Cry"", and a Coca Cola ad is distorted to fit the Elizabethan atmosphere.<br/><br/>If there is anything to complain about, it would be the opening half hour of the film. Luhrmann throws everything but the kitchen sink in terms of film-making techniques, which can be overwhelming. You have Peckinpah-ish use of slow-motion, MTV-inspired rapid-fire editing with odd zoom-ins and outs, almost-slapstick use of speed-up sequences (a la ""The Gods Must be Crazy""), a retro-seventies look in terms of colourful costume design (not unlike the retro-seventies look of ""Strictly Ballroom"") and subtitling, and a retro-eighties feel in terms of the over-acting by the supporting characters. However, once you pass this odd jumble of imagery and get into the story of Romeo and Juliet, the machine-gun barrage slows down to a more manageable pace.<br/><br/>In summary, R&J adds value by putting the play into a different context, and through the use of interesting symbolism and imagery, adds a whole new level of interpretation to this timeless classic. Definitely a must-see (and don't mind the teenyboppers sitting around you-- they just have an essay on R&J due next week for Grade 10 English).<br/><br/>Great movie, classic, needs to be seen. Great emotion and passion into the actors portrayal and the music used to open up the storyline. Yet one question remains; is 'Romeo and Juliet' the greatest love story ever told?"
"scifisuede","7","2","4","2 January 2005"," Not for Shakespeare beginners... or anyone else for that matter
","It's dangerous to expose someone who has never read Shakespeare to this film - so if you haven't, but you're crazy about Leonardo DiCaprio, try to read the book first before watching this piece of bizarre rendition - or, after you watch it, immediately read the book with open mind.<br/><br/>It may not be fair coming from me because I'm not a DiCaprio fan, but I think he's not the right lead actor. He's just *not* Romeo. Danes on the other hand is doing brilliantly as Juliet, and she's the only one close to making her Shakespearean lines believable in this weird MTV-style chaos of 'modern Verona'. The whole combination is just too absurd - I can't imagine how they decided on which parts of the amazing love story to destroy and revamp, and which parts to preserve - but it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Think someone destroying parts of Colosseum and replacing those random parts with steel, glass, and colourful paints. You just don't do such thing!<br/><br/>If you love sparkling visuals like this, see Moulin Rouge instead - there, Luhrmann successfully mixed all his eccentric elements into one stunning musical. If you love Shakespeare, try 1968's Romeo and Juliet instead - it makes much more sense and is less of an insult to this great work of Shakespeare. And... if you love DiCaprio, you might as well watch Titanic instead."

The helicoptors and car chases were dramatic and something that I could easily accept as something Shakespeare might have included if he had written the play in the current era. I can see why many people enjoyed this film. I just couldn't accept Shakespeare's language in modern conversational tones. It made the acting seem abysmal in places and totally unbelievable throughtout. It often seemed as if the actors had no idea of the meaning of the words they spoke.

","ROMEO + JULIET (1996) spoilers((( My personal oppinion of Leonardo DiCaprio is, he isn't a bad actor at all. Here he does a good performance (he also does very good performances in Catch Me If you can, Titanic, Gilbert Grape and Gangs of NY, though The Beach was a bommer. <br/><br/>William Shakespeare's most famous play has been filmed dozens of times, but this is the most peculiar one. This is the modern version of the classical romance - story about two who falls secretely in love. Its wonderful to listen and watch this movie threw very good soundtrack and nice performances, especially from DiCaprio that is. Its romantic, sensual and charming to watch them look at each other threw the aquarium, its a very lovely film! And Baz Luhrmann has also tricked into action scenes, pretty much dramatic and excitement surprisingly enough. The last scene is fantastic when Romeo takes a guy to hostage and starts firing at the cops, it's with other words spellbounding and very entertaining.<br/><br/>
STORY: Known by almost everyone. The Capulet family and the Montague family has always been and are still rivals, under a party the Montague's son Romeo falls in love with the Capulet's daughter Juliet and they secretely sets a marriage in the night. At the same time a war is tensing between the two families...<br/><br/>If you have nor heard or seen the Romeo & Juliet play, this is a good example of the play, though it isn't the original. The weak part of the movie is when its too special and weird for me, as when this black fellow dresses up in women clothes, it gets to weird to me. But, do not be afraid, this is a very good movie.

","Ok, yeah this will contain SPOILERS, but does that really matter since anyone who doesn't know the plot already must have lived in a coma all their lives.<br/><br/>One of these days, I'll write a review, just for the hell of it, of a film that I DON'T like. However, your not going to find that review here as I thought this was brilliant.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann creates here a modern interpretation of one of the greatest works of literature of all time. As a big fan of Shakespeare, I confess to prefering Othello (Iago is my all time favourite fictional character) and Hamlet, but for a play I've read far too often, Luhrmann made me feel like I was watching it for the first time. This film shows the story of the star crossed lovers in a new and fresh way. Yes people condemn (the person who wrote a review without actually watching the film for one. I mean, whats that about. It's a film review site!), but some people do keep an open mind. To relocate a story based so far in the past to the future is a brave idea which admittedly often doesn't work. In this case though, it does. I think in the end of the day, we need to accept that the appeal of Romeo & Juliet is that irrelevant of when you set it, it is a universal story. It is impossible not to bond with at least one of the characters, irrelevant of the era.<br/><br/>Anyway, once you get over the time relocation, there isn't much wrong with this film really. I confess that if I had to choose between the acting abilities of the relatively fresh faced Leo DiCaprio & Claire Danes & the more recent matured incarnations of those actors, I'd choose the more recent ones (after his original few roles, theres no denying Leo has developed 10 fold as an actor & Claire's break obviously has done her the world of good), but I can't help but feel that to rob the characters of the actors almost naivity would ruin this film. Part of the beauty is that Leo & Claire do seem to be as youthful in pretending to be the characters as the characters were themselves. No-one should be allowed to condemn the acting in this film as without the occasional youthful mistake, it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable.<br/><br/>Right, now to try & work up the effort to think of a film I hate & write a review of that. Going to be difficult though."

Neither can speak the verse brilliantly, although both manage to be effective, perhaps because they have youth and beauty on their side.<br/><br/>In support are Miriam Margoyles, Pete Postlethwaite, and others.  All adequate.<br/><br/>But the best things in this Romeo and Juliet have nothing to do with Shakepeare.  First, there's the music - a lovely theme for when the lovers first meet, a drag performance for Mercutio with the disco classic Young Hearts Run Free, a church choir singing When Doves Cry - and the gorgeous visuals (the final sequences are in a shining gold palace of kitsch, there's a fishtank with lovely coloured fish, there's a large pool which helps move the balcony scene along ...).<br/><br/>Don't expect a straightforward classical adaptation.

"mercybell","10","2","4","2 November 2002"," William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""? No, Baz's ""Romeo + Juliet"".
","I remember when this movie came out, all my classmates were seeing it and talking about it, my school got free book covers with Leonardo and Clare until I could hardly stand their faces any more, and I was greatly surprised to hear my chorus teacher give it rave reviews, it was after all, a teen flick, right? But even though I had a great curiosity regarding such a strange movie, I didn't see it. It wasn't till after I had seen Moulin Rouge that I took the initiative to see this film. <br/><br/>I find it fairly amusing that the ""official"" title of this film is ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"", everyone and their uncle knows who wrote it. Everyone and their uncle knows the story. Quite frankly, when I saw it, I was expecting to be bored. I knew how it went, I had read it twice, I had been hearing the story in every vessel of artistic interpretation all my life, from Zeffirelli to Bernstein (well, I love West Side Story). It had been played out, there's only so much mileage you can get. And to me it wasn't Hamlet or King Lear or Much Ado about Nothing which still could hold you enthralled just by a reading. ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet""? What else is new? Sure it's genius, but now, quite simply, it was boring. But this isn't simply Shakespeare's movie, it's Baz Luhrmann's. It made me weep. <br/><br/>Where you might think a hip and slick take on a timeless story has been played out, it has elsewhere, but not here. Luhrmann infuses something into it. The film is at times bizarre and sinister, it's intense, it's rough and awkward, it's colorful and crazy and over the top, it's muted, it's passion frenzy, it's dry, it's slick and sophisticated. It's meticulous and strange and cold and white hot all at once. He shoves it all into Venice Beach and actors and those so very famous beautiful poetic lines and mixed with a complete and total disregard for convention. <br/><br/>Like Moulin Rouge, there's an obsession with details. But these are strange details. Guns with names, palaces and servants for these mafialike characters, beaches and highways and gas stations as playgrounds for the characters. It's a deformed and crazy Verona for '96. The background is filled to the brim with every sort of lavish and extravagant window or bookshelf dressing or religious icon, flowers, car wheel caps, clothing styles, the way hedges are trimmed, and billboards. Nothing is left out. Luhrmann immerses you into another world, it's 1996, but it's not where we're living. Thus we can relate to these people yet still accept this insanity. And that's fitting, the world Shakespeare was evoking wasn't his own secular society either, he was trying to strip it down to the human qualities of a story. <br/><br/>That's why a modern American plain accented actor speaking this complicated dialogue works. We're allowed to believe that these people would talk like this. And the actors give it life and a palpability. It's excellently casted. They give every line with emotion, they act it out, using themselves, but realistically. Danes and Dicaprio are excellent. The various supports do great justice to their roles. It was a joy and a wonder to watch, to see what Shakespeare had intended, with good actors performing well on such a colorful and wacky stage. <br/><br/>Above all the emotional power of the story, which can be beaten out during mandatory reading periods or a repeated session with a bland and average version again and again, remains firm. Especially during the last part of the film. There are no superfluous motions or gestures on the actors' part. They act it to a tee. Baz leaves no emotion or possibility unturned. The blocking and directing gets the best out of the story. For example: Romeo walks through a dazzling and dark candlelit and flower and statue strewn chapel to find Juliet, and he weeps and weeps while saying his lines. This is the imagery and interpretation that flows throughout the movie.<br/><br/>
This is a movie that had a lot of effort and thought and heart and honesty put into it. It has a character and a charisma that I think is lacking in many films today. No one has ever seen the version Shakespeare envisioned, he doesn't give staging or actor's notes, he didn't provide a cliffsnotes version. No one alive can pass down the directions to a performance Shakespeare was present at. Taking this into consideration, Luhrmann created a respectful yet completely unique and enlightening spin on a story that no matter how brilliant, can still get botched by poor translation. I think he extracted the essence of a timeless and beautiful story, and made something incredible. At least he finally made me appreciate it."

I propose to take the middle road.  I don't think that the film is a piece of trash, as Ye Olde Shakespeare Fans tend to brand it.  I also don't think it's the greatest thing since Zeffirelli.  The main thing here is not to compare Luhrmann's vision to Zeffirelli's--or to any traditional performance of the play.  Take it by itself, and it's actually pretty decent.  There are, however, some places where you can't help but notice that Romeo's murder of Tybalt isn't quite the same when it's done in a car chase, or that the lovers' deaths are more tragic, or that you can't seem to recall the families reconciling in this version...

Zeffirelli omitted the reconciliation of the families, and Luhrmann seems to have had no patience for it either. But to Shakespeare it was important, the teachers always told us:  there's always someone at the end of Shakespearean tragedy who picks up the pieces and reminds us that the nightmare is over and the world will go on.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the world of R+J will not.  If I may state the obvious, Luhrmann did not move the play into the present.  He moved it into an alternative present, and that's what allows various anachronisms (such as the peremptory banishment of Romeo) to pass without further explanation."

Once again I wonder does Baz know what FATE is?<br/><br/>I won't say something subjective like: DeCaprio was great or DeCaprio stank. I say objectively that his raw emotion that he brought to the screen was excellent, but this emotion does not replace understanding for the lines he's saying (i.e. he had no understanding of the lines he was saying).

And it's not a big surprise that his work is made into films.  I've seen two versions of Romeo and Juliet in film. One was the one starring Oliva Hussey (Juliet)and Leonard Whiting (Romeo) which dates back to 1968, and this one starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines.<br/><br/>I liked both versions at the same level, because they are both great in their own ways.  In this case, this one takes place in modern time.  For example, Verona, Italy is now Verona Beach, and the Prince is head of a police squad.  The famous balcony scene takes place in a swimming pool, and there are guns rather than swords and daggers.<br/><br/>I loved this version of the classic play by Shakespeare, not only because it's more up to date, but because it is creative and besides the modern elements added to this film, not one thing changed compared to the original play (unlike what they did to ""Great Expectations"" starring Ethan Hawke, which is a disappointment)!

","William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, released on November 1, 1996 by 20th Century Fox, is an American romantic crime tragedy directed and co-produced by Baz Luhrmann and Gabriella Martinelli. It is a modernization of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet. The film includes Hollywood stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the title roles. The story is about Romeo and Juliet who fall in love with each other but cannot publicly show that, because they are members of feuding families. The film shows how blind and addictive love can be and what chaos and tragedy such wonderful feeling can bring. Despite the bad rating on sites like Cinema , this film won prizes such as the Silver Bear for Best Actor. This gives you a first hint about the quality of this production.<br/><br/>Romeo and Juliet is not Shakespeare's best play, but it has been his best poetry. It is about language, about the difference between real dilemmas and how they are described through language. This makes it so hard to film. But that's not all; the story itself is one of the most fundamental ones in the history of theatre and filmmaking up to now. It is so strong one can make a film just through the story without even trying to implement the old-fashioned language. In fact, it can be too strong and there is the fear of losing the connection to the language. But Luhrmann accepts the challenge and produces a modernized version of Romeo and Juliet with some unconventional choices, compared to earlier movies such as Zeffirelli's released in 1968. So, I had been worried that Luhrman would either destroy the play's beauty by setting it in modern times, or slaughter Shakespeare's eloquent words by modernizing it. But I was wrong. While watching the movie, I found almost everything about it incredible.<br/><br/>Luhrman did an excellent job casting Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio as the title roles. Both shine in their unique way and each character has an individual development throughout the story.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo was a brilliant decision. Even though some of his monologues were a bit too dramatically spoken, his performance throughout the film was stunning. DiCaprio's strengths like his huge impulsiveness or his, at that age, strong facial expressions adapt perfectly to the way Shakespeare intended Romeo to act, which leads up to the lover's tragic fate. When the story begins, Romeo is a hopeless romantic who frantically fantasises of love, and seems to linger more in his dreams than in the real world on earth. He is overthinking love without having any real clue what true love is. This changes the moment he gets to meet Juliet and where he begins to understand the true depth and passion of love. DiCaprio is one of the best, if not the best actor, when it comes to tragic romantic scenes. With his acting skills, one can really feel the development Romeo experienced. Leonardo DiCaprio is just the top romantic tragedy actor as he proves one year later in the movie Titanic (1997).<br/><br/>Then there is Claire Danes who was equally impressive. She has an innocent face, looks really young and more importantly acts almost flawlessly throughout the entire movie. You can see the depth of this character's development by focusing on behaviour this innocent kid shows off. There is a big contrast between the beginning of the film with her naive mindset and at the end where she brutally suicides herself. She plays a believable naive girl who has not yet experienced true love. Even though she is someone I have not seen in too many movies she proves her quality in this film.<br/><br/>
Lastly, there is the Nurse, played by Miriam Margolyes, who does an excellent job. Despite the fact that she plays a flat character without any progression in terms of development, she acts those parts very authentic. You get the impression that she sees Juliet as a daughter, because of the language and the way she performs her role.<br/><br/>My favourite scene of the movie is perhaps the most iconic scene in the film, when Romeo opens the door to the church see Juliet's dead body. This scene is filled with lots of details so you have to watch it multiple times to comprehend its depth and beauty. For one there is the atmosphere this scene presents. With the low angle shots and body frames you get the view that you are present in the actual scene. Combined with the crazy number of white candles and blue crosses, it creates a heart-breaking mood without even knowing the plot. After that, the scene continues with the reaction Romeo has on Juliet's death. This reaction proves that this is the best Romeo adaption you can find out there. You can feel the anger and sadness he expresses when kissing and crying to Juliet's ""dead body"". At that time, Juliet wakes up and witnesses Romeo taking the poison. That makes everything even more devastating. After that you see how Juliet changes her mood from loving to sadness in a way, it really goes into your heart as well as under your skin. To end it all perfectly, she notices the gun laying in her coffin and decides to pull the trigger while aiming the gun towards her head. In my eyes this is probably the most affecting death you can get at that point. The decision to swap out the dagger and instead using a gun, to end the story, makes it more relatable and puts the cherry on top. By and large this end has memorable images followed with remarkable language.<br/><br/>
The soundtrack of the movie ""Young Hearts Run Free"" and ""Kissing You"", both released on the Capitol Records label, did an excellent job underlining the powerful scenes, and emphasizing the feeling you experience. Though I think it lacked background vocals; in the last scene they could have implemented a choir's vocal style underlining the immortality/mortality contrast dilemma in that scene. Both costumes and special effects, such as the aquarium scene, the TV that introduces and closes the movie, or the gang outfits, create refreshing scenarios so the viewer nonstop enjoys the movie. Also, the camera is restless. There are times when the rapid cuts combined with the soundtrack cause confusion to the viewer, which leads to more attention given. But one critical point with the special effects is the consistent and extreme use of colours, which end up in a negative way. It is easy to lose the common thread in the story when there is too much happening on screen. Some scenes suffer from exactly that, like the ""LSD trip"" the Montagues have. Overall the production value is pretty high standard and well produced, and can compete with films released nowadays!<br/><br/>In conclusion Romeo and Juliet (1996) is in my opinion a very underrated modernization of Shakespeare play. What surprised me was that it was set in present day and still matched almost perfectly. It contained its original dialogue which brings the language back and shows how old but still relevant Shakespeare's plays are. I highly recommend you see it as soon as possible. If you are a fan of Shakespeare like me, you are almost guaranteed to enjoy this movie even with the implementation of modern world and society."

","The only way this review has spoilers is if you live under a rock. But the button is there so I clicked it. You're welcome.<br/><br/>Romeo & Juliet is the play read in every Junior High/High School in America. So much of the language within the play itself has bonded to English colloquialisms and idioms that English would have a gaping void where ""star-crossed lovers"" would be. It is not, however, Shakespeare's best story (see Hamlet, Henry V, The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, need I go on?), but it has  and violence and enough angst to make the most emo of teens put on a polo and khakis and ask the protagonists to grow up and get a life.
Baz Luhrmann has absolutely no problem putting his name in lights first and the movie second. This is 120 minutes of Baz Luhrmann doing that thing that Baz Luhrmann does best: pander. This movie was not meant for adults to roll eyes at. This was meant for the teens of '96 to swoon over their beloved Leo and secretly hate Claire Danes. This movie launched a thousand feathered wing attachments for the last two decades dragged out every Halloween.
If it did have one positive byproduct, it is that teenagers picked up a book to relive the glorious balcony and tragic death scenes.
To the grit of the movie, modernization brings trouble. A sassy Mercutio - Harold Perrineau did his best with this - is delightful, but not when the pacing and the rhythm of the poetry is sacrificed for it. DiCaprio was in his acting infancy during this film and was sullen as cardboard. Paul Rudd was delightfully dopey but Paris' best lines, his raison d'être, were completely cut. Claire Daines has ugly weeps. Seriously ugly weeps. The kind of ugly weeps from when you skinned your knee when you were three and had no idea how to process that information.
There is a spectacular supporting cast. Paul Sorvino as Capulet, Brian Dennehy as Montague, the formidable Diane Venora as Lady Capulet, the hugely underrated M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. And gosh darned Peter Postlethwaite, the priest who knows the true identity of Kaiser Soze. Miriam Margolyes as The Nurse, a mainstay of British comedy and acting with a portfolio that should have shamed the other actors sharing a screen with her, except Peter Postelthwaite. John Leguizamo who obviously owed somebody a favor and showed up to this movie. A tremendous amount of talent passing on and off the screen. And it's entirely wasted because Baz Luhrmann had to make a ""cool"" movie.
If 15 year old me were writing this, it would be in big loopy letters with hearts over the ""i""'s pining for my beloved Romeo. 36 year old me says spare me the special effects, ham fisted metaphors(ooh, you know this is where the movie becomes really dark because the sky becomes really dark!), insufferable editing, and give me Paul Rudd. He seems like the adult in the room who's got his life together. I don't think he owned a gun. He probably had a great credit score, job security, and a 401k. Aside from the whole marrying a 14 year old, because that's gross, he seemed like an ok guy. Someone put Paris on a registry please.
However, this movie will sit on my guilty pleasure shelf to remind of the days when all that mattered were hair, makeup, clothes, and zits. Because, despite its flaws, it actually is fun to watch. If you forget that the great bards prose and poetry are being munched and chewed and accept it for the 90's period piece that it is. You can laugh along at the funny moments, recollect at the "" my parents just don't understand"" moments, and sigh at the romantic moments. We were all teenagers once. While that doesn't make this movie good, it redeems it from being unwatchable.
In summary, Romeo + Juliet was basically a great soundtrack your boyfriend had at his house when you went over to do what teenagers did before Netflix and chill. It screams ""love me, love me"". And the rest, to paraphrase another play, is angsty silence."

","The passage of time has not been kind to this film as far as IMDb's rating system goes. But can you picture the love struck couples who went to see this in the theater when it was originally released? I can just imagine the weeping that occurred at the end of the story, teenage girls clutching their boyfriends' arms in shocked and swollen grief. Ah yes, the saga of Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>I actually had a pretty good time with this flick and I'm not really a Shakespeare buff. The modern day updating has a weird sensibility to it, pitting two warring families against each other - the Montagues and the Capulets. The only thing is, it's never really mentioned what started the feud off in the first place. It seemed kind of senseless, and appeared to be almost ethnic in nature, something I don't think will ever be overcome by people who see others as different from themselves. Shakespearean dialog in the hands of these hip-hop oriented thespians sounds oddly anachronistic, but serves well, especially during the comedic moments. I got the biggest kick out of the Montagues 'biting their thumbs' at the Capulets. I don't know if that was in the original play but I thought that scene was hilarious. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is far from a favorite of mine but he did a decent job here as Romeo, as did Claire Danes as Juliet. I'm pretty sure Shakespeare would not have envisioned Romeo in a shootout with the cops near the story's finale, nor would he have envisioned much of what else goes on in this latter day tale set in Verona Beach, with players attired in Hawaiian shirts and gang-banger threads coming at each other. But the essence of Romeo and Juliet is there, and if you've been predisposed to ignore the famous bard, a picture like this might just have you picking up a copy of Shakespeare."

","Based on the original screenplay by William Shakespeare, Romeo + Juliet attempts to take more of a modern approach to the film, but in my opinion fails to deliver. Don't get me wrong, some aspects of the film were at most ""meh"", but I found the film bizarre and also scrappily put together. Don't get me wrong people will still find enjoyment out of this film depending on their taste, but I just found this to be a somewhat weak comedy with a few scenes of romance.<br/><br/>The plot: very similar if not just an adaptation of the original screenplay. There isn't much to say here, apart from the fact that they more or less used all the original lines from Shakespeare's classic. This is very interesting and it's nice that they experimented with this, despite making the film even more confusing as I constantly try to decide whether this film is based in the past or the present. <br/><br/>The characters seem to be relatively corny and while they have their dialog to characterize them which actually lets them stand out from the minor characters, they also have a sort of comedic twist to them (seriously how is this not a comedy?). A good example of this is Mercutio. At the start of the film, he was wearing bizarre clothes, and I'm not joking when I say that I thought his character was supposed to be a reference to how women didn't act in Shakespearian times, as it was thought to be ""unladylike"". The characters themselves were executed relatively fine; nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>The music used a blend of classic songs with more late 90s songs. While this was an interesting mix, this somehow worked. With the tone of the film being fairly light hearted and cheesier then dark and edgy on some scenes, the songs worked to make it feel like a parody of Romeo and Juliet. I still don't know if it is a parody or not, but I can't be bothered to research it.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was decent at most and also bizarre and annoying at most. At the end I kept screaming ""JUST LOOK DOWN ROMEO OH MY GOD"", before Romeo was about to poison himself. I found this moment unrealistic, as if you're going to show the character die, don't make them start to wake up in that moment and instead wake up as Romeo is dying, unless this was intentional of course, so good job on that. Overall, I found this film at most funny and at least corny. I'd give this film a 6/10."

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","0","9 February 2017"," A modern movie with archaic dialogues does not work.
","Changing or using material from Shakespeare always requires courage and maturity. He's just the greatest British playwright of all time. Baz Luhrmann had this courage and much more, in a film that updates the most famous love story ever, bringing it to our time, to a great seaside town. This may displease the purists but its not original. This has happened to other stories by other authors. However, this film has the characteristic of keeping, almost in full, the original dialogues of Shakespeare. I confess that I really enjoyed listening to them, but there is a natural nasty discrepancy between the Renaissance text and the modern environment, they disagree with each other for the most obvious reasons and this damages the film. If the idea was to bring the story to modern times the most natural solution would have been to adapt the dialogues, but if the option were to keep Shakespeare's text untouched, the best would be a period film. Mixing both concepts did not work out.<br/><br/>The film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles. DiCaprio was still enjoying his stage as a ""handsome movie boy"", while Danes was just a beautiful unknown face to a Juliet who wanted to be naive and young. In fact, this actress employed very little in this film beyond her physical beauty, for she always sounded unconvincingly and never really seemed to be in love. The scenarios are quite curious and full of exaggerations. The Capulet house could be the mansion of any new-wealthy businessman, with its tacky décor and kitsch furnishings. These elements are also visible in the family mausoleum, with all the candles and neon crosses. In the middle of all, Danes and DiCaprio stand out for the sobriety of their costumes. Harold Perrineau probably gives us the most controversial performance, turning Mercutio into an African-American transvestite, full of glitter. Pete Postlethwaite did quite well as Father Laurence, as Miriam Margoyles in the maid role. The soundtrack wisely uses some pieces of classical music, but this doesn't harmonize with the modern pieces that were used as well."

This telling of a old story with new elements as the fight between the two houses was updated to be a fight between to family companies and the wonderful prince being the police captain. Over all this is one of the most creative movies I have seen in a while a nice retell of a old story that everyone knows to a seemly different story that had lots of little differences that created a wonderfully updated and whimsical story but still had the classic feel of Romeo and Juliet which of course means it's incredibly sad and even though we know the ending it's still a fun ride to the end."

If you don't know the story, shame on you, but here's a synopsis. Two families, the Montagues and Capulets, are constantly feuding, and Romeo, a Montague, and Juliet, a Capulet, subsequently fall in love. Their love is not allowed, due to their parents' hatred for each other, and so they secretly get married. This entire story is based (literally line by line) off of William Shakespeare's play, The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>The best thing this film has to offer is, quite obviously, the dialogue. The lines used in this film is the exact lines William Shakespeare wrote in the 16th century. The plot, along with the dialogue, is ingenious. The forbidden love between the two plays off amazingly. The direction in this film also is pretty good. It has a few flaws; some shaky cam, bad close ups, etc. However, it's more good than it is bad. The acting is also really good. This is one of DiCaprio's first roles, besides What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), in which he received his first Oscar nomination. He is super young here, but still does a great job. Claire Danes does great as well. She's not in many movies (thanks to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)), but she really should be. She does fantastic in this film. The first negative in this film is the ""gangster"" vibe of it. The original story takes place in the 14th century in Verona, Italy. This film takes place in 1996 in Verona Beach, California. Nobody uses swords; they all use engraved, golden guns. This movie would've been near perfect if the director kept to the formula that Shakespeare wrote. The nowaday feel of the movie makes for a complete mess, with too much unnecessary drama at the wrong times, and confusing dialogue that makes no sense when a character says the word ""sword"" or especially old English, using words like ""doth"" and ""thou.""<br/><br/>Overall, Romeo + Juliet wasn't too bad. I expected better than the utterly stupid theme of the slums, and the occasional bad direction, most abundant during fight scenes. I'm going to give Romeo + Juliet a C+, or a 7 out of 10."

","Romeo + Juliet (1996): Dir: Baz Luhamann / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Brian Dennehy, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino: This is perhaps the most modern you can translate the works of Shakespeare and despite the intriguing vision there is much that may or may not translate. The story is as old as mold. Two families are at odds while the romance between a young couple is threatened. Interesting Shakespearean dialogue placed within modern society but we know the tragedy and the violence is more severe and repetitious. Juliet's home is wonderfully Shakespearean thanks to massive art direction that clashes both Shakespearean and modern society. Director Baz Luhamann gives the film a precise visual appeal that will bring a new image to the whole idea of anything associated with William Shakespeare. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes follow the formalities and pull off a modern day romantic Bonnie and Clyde persona until that forever cheap tragedy arrives. Brian Dennehy and Pete Postlethwaite are well cast as their fathers who see confrontation as an only answer. It presents modernization of the play but the violence seems tailored to action fans. Students of Shakespearean literature may disapprove of the modern translation due to its level of violence. It is not entirely successful but merely intriguing in its presentation of classic literature to the bizarre. Score: 7 / 10"

","Shakespeare gets a Hollywood make over in Baz Luhrmann's high-octane remake of Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>The Australian director manages to combine an exciting mix of original Shakespearean dialect and Hollywood action, which together delivers a brilliant new concept to film making.<br/><br/>The casting of Leonardo Di Caprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet are inspired choices, as they both give the best performance of their fledgling careers.<br/><br/>Although this is a story which has been told many times before, Luhrmann keeps the idea fresh, mainly by using a lovely mixture of fast editing and beautifully choreographed fight scenes, which wouldn't look out of place in a John Woo action film. It also combines a fantastic soundtrack with a stunning backdrop of 'Verona Beach'.<br/><br/>Right from the explosive beginning to the tragic ending, Romeo and Juliet will keep you captivated. This is a testament to Luhrmann's brilliant snappy direction, which will take you on a roller-coaster ride of car chases, gun fights and a love that was destined to fail.<br/><br/>Luhrmann's ability to keep the audience wanting more is no more apparent than the ending. You would have to have been living under a rock, for the last 100 years to not know how Romeo and Juliet ends. But Luhrmann manages to keep the audience hoping that this time it will be different.<br/><br/>Would Will Shakespeare be happy with this adaptation of his work? We'll never know, although any fans of Shakespeare should leave the cinema pleased with this mordernised version."
"SnoopyStyle","6","0","0","26 December 2014"," overwhelming Baz Luhrmann style
","Baz Luhrmann injects his brash style into Shakespeare's famous play. It's the modern world in a place called Verona. The two families of Capulets and Montagues are powerful corporate giants with gun totting thugs. Claire Danes plays Juliet Capulet and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Romeo Montague. There is no doubt that this is one of the more unique interpretations. Luhrmann throws every visual flashiness at the audience. He's pumped up the material with so many bells and whistles that the story feels overwhelmed. The music choice sometimes grades on my nerves. The leads are an adorable pairing. I wish Luhrmann has some more faith in the actors to allow them some peace and quiet to do their work. They do good work in the balconey scene but Luhrmann can't stop moving. The flash and glitz becomes more of a distraction."

","You know, I get a little tired of this recent surge of movies trying to update, modernize and stylize William Shakespeare's greatest work. I saw it recently in Romeo Must Die and but that film can be forgiven, it wasn't a direct telling of the tale.<br/><br/>William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is quite simply, a mess. It is a music video, a cola commercial, a teen prime-time soap opera and a new-age photoplay. What it is not, is comprehensable to those of us moved by the greatest love story ever told.<br/><br/>Romeo and Juliet is the story of two people so desperately in love that they are willing to die for one another. This movie never allows us to realize that because it's hyperkinetic energy never slows down long enough for us to generate much interest in the story.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are two talented, beautiful people but they never get a moment when they can look into one another's eyes and convince us that they are in love for any reason other then the story requires it.<br/><br/>Most of that stems from the facts that none of the actors ever really listen to the dialogue. When they aren't mumbling they are shouting, when they aren't shouting they are at the mercy of an editor and a camera man who can't stand to linger on an image for longer than the lastest music video would require.<br/><br/>Now, I've seen Shakespeare updated to modern times recently and in some cases it works (""Richard III"" and Branaugh's ""Hamlet"" come to mind). The key to Romeo and Juliet is simplicity. Love and heartbreak is a simple acts, not a hyperventilating-surround sound-rock-rap music video Romeo and Juliet should touch your heart, not punch you in the head."

","I'm glad I finally watched this but I'll be honest I struggled to stay with this slick, fast paced update of the Shakespeare tragedy. I wasn't expecting the original dialogue and it took a bit to get used to.<br/><br/>Leo steals and captivates every scene that he's in though; so young, so cute and so talented, just amazing and it was through him that I eventually got into the movie. It's a very modern MTV-ish sort of retelling set in the violent, hip netherworld of Verona beach where the gun-toting Montague and the Capulet families battle for power and territory. <br/><br/>At times this felt like a Quentin Tarentino movie in its visual style, cool music and random bizarreness. Great performances all-round but especially from Harold Perrineau, Romeo's gender bending friend and John Leguizamo as his arch rival. The big battle between these three is when the movie really took off ""a plague on both your houses"" and the last half an hour is captivating as our star-crossed lovers meet their tragic destiny all because of stupid UPS. 9/20/14"

","Contemporized not Modernized<br/><br/>Some many reviews of this tasty film misuse the English in saying this production modernized Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet so patiently I resist beating down such verbalizations and those that present such limited misrepresentations. This film is deeper than a mere modernization it not only makes Shakespeare's Romeo Juliet understandable to a modern audience but liberates them from reactionary nostalgic beliefs for these are the contemporary wise guys dames thugs dudes and others so often marginalized by a society that demonizes humanity for all its wrongs characterized wrongly in what the government appoints itself the arbiter of in monopoly of what it sells and dictates but denies in others as it is all right just and proper.<br/><br/>A fine production fine acting fine writing fine set designs in an eternal romance as such will never die as a story that lives forever in that it is told so as to be brought to each generation a new in what is so well felt and inspires human beings where before there was none.

","It's not often, when a director is able to a reinvent an iconic story, and make us look at a well-known piece of literature in a different light. Director Baz Luhrmann does just that. With the help of a superb cast that includes; Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo among others, Luhrmann retells one of the most popular and tragic love stories of all time.<br/><br/>The plot and dialog are authentically Shakespearean. However, Luhrmann dares to make a risky move by transporting the events of the movie into the late 1990's. The horses become flashy cars, the dagger and swords are replaced by uniquely elegant and fearsome pistols and the streets of old Verona look more like the concrete jungles of Los Angeles, in this place called Verona Beach. This move by the director is bold to say the least, but the risk sure pays off, creating one of the more original movies in the full sense of the word.<br/><br/>This movie is fast, but does not race to the end, giving the viewer an opportunity to enjoy every scene. It is flashy and colorful, yet not overbearing or pretentiously grandiose. It is fun and tragically sad at the same time. The two most important aspects of this movie for me, were; precise attention to details, (costumes, sets, cars, weaponry,) and the fact that the movie, although being a serious one, does not take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>The characters of the movie are vibrant and extravagant. Romeo and Juliet are young, naive, passionate and madly in love, just as they are in the play. Tybalt and Mercutio steal the movie in my opinion. They are eccentric, flashy, arrogant and aggressive yet graceful. They are the kind of characters that you want to know more about, even after their roles have expired.<br/><br/>Not everyone will be able to appreciate this movie, just like not everyone will be excited about listening to Shakespearean style language for 2 hours (I recommend watching this movie with subtitles.) But those who do, will truly enjoy this original film, which manages to do what most movies only wish they could.<br/><br/>It stands on its own."
"KineticSeoul","5","0","0","14 August 2013"," Baz Luhrmann imagery doesn't connect with the story
","""Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes"" is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version.<br/><br/>5.9/10"

","Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance.<br/><br/>The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible.<br/><br/>The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent.<br/><br/>The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. A must for all. Easily enjoyable by men and women, from teen and onward."

","""Romeo + Juliet"" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled ""Dagger"" or ""Longsword"" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life."

","Before I get started on this, I just want say I put spoilers because This review might contain them. A friend of mine was talking about this film with me and he accused me of disliking good films (This and a few others), so I decided to give this another watch. Anyways here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>This movie is awful, the fact that they make the setting in modern Verona wouldn't be a problem if they modernized the DIALOGUE too. Not modernizing the dialogue just makes it confusing,and why the heck do they call their guns, swords?...In my opinion it's just stupid.<br/><br/>The two main leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are the worst actors in this film. They do NOT know how to do Shakespearean dialogue, they come off as wooden, especially Claire Danes who rarely puts any emotion in her lines (then again neither does DiCaprio but a little more than she does), the only good actors in this film are Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postletwaite as Juliet's Nurse and Friar (Or Father in this film) Laurence, but the rest of the actors either don't put any effort into their lines, or they go overly dramatic. It's kind of a shame seeing as they got good actors for this film.<br/><br/>ALSO why make Mercutio a DRAG QUEEN? It's unnecessary and just plain gross and even when he wasn't dressed like a woman he was still annoying. the whole thing is shot like a music video to entertain the MTV crowd/younger generation, but it made ME feel like I was on acid or something.<br/><br/>Now there are some good things in this film,I've mentioned Miriam Margolyes and Pete Postlewaite, but there are more. First the soundtrack is good, and the beginning where they were introducing Romeo and Juliet's parents(Lord and Lady Capulet and Montague) was my favorite scene in this film (But only because the music on that part was friggin AWESOME). Then there's John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who is enjoyable because of how over the top he was, but even that can't save this atrocious film. This movie just flat out sucks, if it was meant to appeal to the younger crowd then I'm not one of them, if you're part of the MTV crowd then you'll probably like this film. If you wish to watch a good adaption of Romeo and Juliet, watch the 1968 version the acting is a LOT better in that film, or watch West Side Story (1961) which actually does the modernization right. I can't say that I would recommend Romeo and Juliet (1936) because I haven't seen that film yet, but anyways those are my two cents on this film, thanks for reading (I guess)"

","The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying. Overall the movie was OK. If you are shakepaere fan, then you will enjoy it. Overall, it gets a 5/10."

","Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in."

","This is how his plays would look like. Romeo and Juliet is just one revision by director Baz Luhrmann and the MTV Generation, as the 400 year old written text by thee William Shakespeare is put though a grinder, and out comes the meat of the story repacked and sold to the audience. Romeo and Juliet is the story, oops I meant Romeo + Juliet is the story of two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. While most people know the plot, this movie just gives you all the highlights clips of the film in prologue. Yes, you don't believe have to bother watching the film, it's just shoot it up there with fast pace zooming and out, with epic background music. Unlike the 1968 Zeffirelli version, this takes place in the fictional modern-day location called Verona Beach, where the two houses of Capulets and Montagues are just giant corporations. What do they sell? Who knows-- all we know is that they hate each other for some odd reason and it's ripping the city apart. The play was set in Italy, but in this film, I have no clue if it's Latin America, America or some country in Spain. Believe me, I love Shakespeare, but it has its place, and doesn't need to be reduced to nausea-inducing jokes like having guns manufactured by Sword, wild car crashes, and over used drug use. That's just stupid and unnecessary. This is an antiquated love story, made for its time and best when set in its time. There is nothing good about making a loud, obnoxious, absurdly anachronistic monstrosity and sometimes this movie go overboard. Everything is modern, but the language of the film. If you don't understand the language, READ and study the story first. The language is early modern English, but has been translated into dozens of modern languages. By modernizing many aspects of the story and using popular, engaging actors to portray the roles, a new generation of fans can appreciate the gift of Shakespeare. Who would've thought to update Shakespeare to a modern setting, keep the original language, replace daggers with gun, and add a kick ass soundtrack? Quite frankly, it's genius and the execution brilliant, but it's a bit annoying. This movie does shows how Shakespeare can transcend time,﻿culture, and age, but not well suite. I've always interpreted the story as a tragedy, not a love story. Romeo and Juliet is hardly a love story. Romeo (Leonardo DiCapiro) and Juliet (Claires Danes) are two love-sick teenagers rushing headlong toward doom. Claire Danes was so well casted. She fits this role as Julia perfectly. So innocent, so pure, so divine. Leo is not just a pretty face. It's his pure talent, his amazingly unique looks, the way he speaks, and laughs, his piercing eyes, the way he adapts into characters, his innocent yet cheeky intriguing personality, and his intelligence. I do love the scene where both of their character meet through a fish tank. It was catchy, but still both of their characters are flawed. Romeo and Juliet may be a satire of a romance story. Romantic love in the basic sense is nothing more or less than physical lust rather than﻿the deep connection between two human beings. This seems to ring thought the characters as much of the theme of the piece is more loin love rather than love. Throughout, we are bombarded by sexual references, most of which are jocular. In the Queen Mab monologue, for example, Mercutio (Harold Perrineau) points his heavy laden and loaded, weapon at his own youthful tangled emotions. A powder keg of hot blood tormented and moved in night straightening. Youth is often lead by it's loins, and often into trouble. The stirring of mad blood leading to a fatal fate. This movie kinda ruins that monologue using Queen Mab as a drug. Harold does a great old as Mercutio, but it felt like Mercutio was just there to be a homosexual cross dresser drug dealer. That's pretty far from the source there, Baz. As the film goes on, a number of great theme comes into play, the bright colors, immaculate hearts, religious symbols like crosses, and stage on the beach makes the film seem surreal and strange. The violence is not so poetic when you take a bullet to the head. Have they actually read the book? We are so in glue as if it's a true love story when it's source really wasn't saying that. The whole play takes place over like four days!﻿How is that true love?!Love is usually the cause of nothing but anguish for the character's in his plays. Love not only consumes their lives, but often ends with them dying, killing someone, or going through a lot of ridiculousness before they can have what they love. It's not based on the subject he wrote in, but how Shakespeare wrote about love that proves the above statement. There's a sonnet he wrote that details his thoughts on love, and it's not flattering. In the play they're supposed to be quite young and don't take time to make good decisions. Both Romeo and Juliet are deluded in their love for each other, and their romance is a product of them wanting to escape their realities. Wouldn't the simplest explanation for their romance﻿ be forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest? I think this modernization of Romeo and Juliet makes it more reliable and entertaining. The supporting actors like Pete Postlethwaite (Father Laurence), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Miriam Margolyes (the Nurse) all play their parts great. Kissing you by Des'ree is a great emotional song, but still Romeo and Juliet are so freaking unstable in the modern sense. It's not a happy ever after, but a tragedy that this couldn't live up to the 1968 version."

","Alright. This film is something. When I popped it in last week I knew what I was expecting and it surprised even me. This modern, bizarre, beautiful, crazy adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most beloved plays is something of a spectacle. It's a classic romance for MTV's generation X from one of the most electric directors of the last 20 years. And since I'm assuming up you passed a middle school literature/English class ill give slight spoilers.<br/><br/>There's a lot for me to talk about in this film. Lets start off with the art style and dialogue. To use Shakespearean English in a modern setting is at 1st kinda off putting. But I grew use to it as the film went on and became immersed in the story. The cinematography is brilliant and gritty like a gang film while having richness and fulfillment of something from renaissance Europe. The acting is pretty good across the board. Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes were pretty great. The said their lines well for young actors and besides a few scenes of over acting were good. ( Romeo pursuing Tybalt to kill him.) Their final scene is powerful and well done. The supporting cast was good to especially,Harold Perrinau (Mercutio), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Pete Postlethwaite (""Father Lawrence""). The music was good too and I love Talk Show Host by Radiohead( One of my favorite early songs by them). <br/><br/>However film has flaws. Because they use Shakespearean English they are awkward moments in the movie like Romeo's Banishment and the use of guns called swords. The film use of helicopter in the final scene pursuing Romeo proved a tad excessive too. Also the use of News Casters in the beginning and end is also weird. <br/><br/>Sometimes u can't take this seriously. And I didn't take this film to seriously. It's one of the most stylized and unique films I've seen. However it kinda fails in comparison to other Shakespearean adaptations, ( See Akira Kurosamwa's Ran) but its a fine film and worthy of being watched. If u hate the 90's or over the top movies, stay away. Everyone else, Enjoy."
"JamesHitchcock","6","0","0","13 December 2012"," One of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet
","In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" rather than simply ""Romeo and Juliet"". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. This might be true of something like the Kenneth Branagh ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", but it is certainly not true of this film. Derek Jarman's version of ""The Tempest"" probably remains the most eccentric Shakespearean film adaptation I have seen, but Baz Luhrmann's runs it close. <br/><br/>Luhrmann transfers the action to a modern American city, ""Verona Beach"", with the Montagues and Capulets represented as rival criminal gangs masquerading as legitimate businesses. The idea of portraying the two families as feuding gangsters is not an original one. It is copied straight from Leonard Bernstein's musical ""West Side Story"" and the film that was made from it. Like the Jets in the musical, Luhrmann's Montagues are white Anglo-Saxons, whereas his Capulets, like the Sharks, are Hispanic. (Mercutio, who belongs to neither side despite his friendship with Romeo, is black). ""White Anglo-Saxon"" does not, however, in this context equate to ""Protestant""; both families are obviously Catholic, and the film is notable for its use of Catholic religious imagery, with rosaries, religious statues, etc., much to the fore. <br/><br/>The difference between the two films is that ""West Side Story"" keeps the basic outline of Shakespeare's story, modernising it and transferring it to 1950s New York, but changes the names of the characters and does not use any of Shakespeare's words. Luhrmann, however, retains Shakespeare's original dialogue (in an abridged form), and only makes minor changes to the plot; for example, the Prince becomes Captain Prince, the local police chief, Friar Lawrence becomes Father Lawrence (a priest rather than a friar) and swords are replaced by guns. (This does not, however, necessitate any change in the dialogue; 'Sword' becomes the name of a gun manufacturer). <br/><br/>Luhrmann's film suffers from a problem common to a number of cinematic attempts to modernise Shakespeare. There is a jarring contrast between the modern setting and the sixteenth-century language, and an even more jarring contrast between that setting and the sixteenth century attitudes which that language expresses. These contrasts are not normally an issue in the theatre, which is a very different medium and which does not generally aim for the same degree of realism as the cinema. Filmed Shakespeare generally works better when the director either keeps the traditional setting (as Zeffirelli did with his ""Romeo and Juliet"") or transfers it to a fantasy setting (as Branagh did with his ""Much Ado about Nothing"" or Trevor Nunn with his ""Twelfth Night"", to take two other examples from the nineties). <br/><br/>To give an example of what I mean by a ""jarring contrast"", it seems odd to see on screen a late twentieth-century American police officer threatening, in antique language, two warring gang bosses with the death penalty if their followers cause any more trouble. Our instincts are to ask ""But what about their constitutional rights? What about due process?"" To reply that the police officer is supposed to represent a absolute Renaissance Italian ruler is no real answer; it merely invites the further question ""Then why not keep a setting in which rulers do have absolute powers of life and death?"" <br/><br/>The film's other main drawback is that neither of the leads are very good. In 1996 Leonardo DiCaprio was still in the pretty-boy, heartthrob stage of his career; indeed, he must be one of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet, the pointy-chinned Claire Danes. Serious acting for DiCaprio was something that would not come until some years later, and here he is bland and uninteresting. Natalie Portman was originally cast as Juliet, but Luhrmann sacked her after production began, apparently because he was unhappy with the age difference between her (15 at the time) and DiCaprio (22). As, however, Danes is only two years older than Portman, and plays the role in a very ""adolescent"" way, with a breathy voice and a perpetual expression of wide-eyed innocence, I am not sure that the change in casting made any real difference. <br/><br/>I didn't like Harold Perrineau's camp, lisping Mercutio; he appeared to be trying to imply a gay sub-text into the relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, which struck me as inappropriate. Some of the actors playing the Capulets, notably Paul Sorvino as Old Capulet and Miriam Margolyes as the Nurse, affected odd foreign accents, while others, such as Danes, spoke in standard American accents. There were, however, acting performances I liked, such as John Leguizamo, who brought the necessary arrogance and swagger to Tybalt, Pete Postlethwaite's dignified Father Lawrence and Vondie Curtis-Hall's authoritative Prince. <br/><br/>Luhrmann's direction is a bit too flashy for my taste, with excessive use of cross-cutting, but he does bring a good deal of pace and excitement to many scenes, especially the fight scenes. Despite my reservations about the basic concept, and some of the acting performances, I have given the film an above-average mark, largely because it is Shakespeare, and you can't go too far wrong with Shakespeare, at least not with a play as great as ""Romeo and Juliet"". (You could probably go very wrong with something like ""Troilus and Cressida"" or ""Titus Andronicus"", but not too many people try to film those plays). ""Romeo + Juliet"" is always watchable, if only as an interesting experiment. It does not, however, compare to the really great Shakespearean films such as the Zeffirelli version of this story. 6/10"

","I hadn't seen this movie in years. I remember actually liking it when it first came up. Should I mentioned I didn't speak English at that time?

Just watch Di Caprio's scenes with Pete Postlethwaite's Laurence: day & night. The movie is so well intentioned, the updating ideas are good, the production design excellent; even the frantic editing and the pop music fit this modern adaptation.

","I'll admit to have been shocked when I saw this movie scored 6.8. It led me to read many of the reviews, good and bad, and the film seems to have polarised its audience, they either loved it or hated it. I'm most surprised by those who profess to be Shakespeare fans.<br/><br/>Shakespeare was not a period dramatist, he was thoroughly modern in his day. His plays tackled (amongst others) the military, comedy, drama and love and romance and he was well feted for his works in his lifetime.<br/><br/>If I were a fan, I should be delighted that his original (and now ancient) dialogue could be so well blended with the modern visual. Rather than spinning is his grave, I'd say Shakespeare would celebrate the fact that his play (screenplay here) still holds merit in a sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll twentieth century setting.<br/><br/>If you prefer, or can only accept, your Shakespeare with tights, green velvet costumes and feathers in the cap along with cut glass English accents and endless pauses to stare into empty space then don't watch this. If, however, you feel you can overcome the modern visual blended with its ancient dialogue, then this is a must because if you like it then I promise you'll love it and, if you love it, you will be well rewarded."

A transformation of archaic English phraseology into such a contemporary setting that manifest its power and grace of the human voice across the centuries. The potent content and import of every sentence and action portrayed and powerfully, passionately conveyed and clearly understood even to the uninitiated to Shakespearean voice. <br/><br/>The modern settings and beyond clever, really inspired analogs to the Elizabethan moments and characters were absolutely brilliant. <br/><br/>I could not believe when I heard it was initially reviewed with criticism at its original debuts. Then I thought so was Disney's Fantasia ... clearly the work was ahead of the critics in both cases.<br/><br/>Let me just add a fact or two to buttress the credibility of my review here and my abilities to know a great talent when I see or hear it.<br/><br/>Fact 1.) I was a teenager (~17-18) sitting in my family's living room and a movie came on that I started watching ... after a few moments time I was engrossed ... I was sure I was seeing something I had never seen before it was the most exciting, engaging show TV or otherwise I had ever seen ... I began trying to grab siblings passing by pleading with them you have to see this movie, I am telling you I have never seen anything like it before ... though it fell on deaf ears I nonetheless noted that movie and it wasn't till years later in a talk show interview that I found out who the director of that movie was. None other then Steven Spielberg and his master work that he says himself he goes back to review when he wants to remember how to make a movie, titled ""Deul"".<br/><br/>Fact 2.) Years later a Texas Cowgirl band was playing at an IBM company outing that I was attending... they were I thought beyond good ... I had to have one of their CDs and went up to purchase one and with complete earnestness said, ""I really think you all will make it big."" The lead singer and bass fiddle player looked at me askance and sarcastically said, ""Oh you do, do ya!"". The other members graciously thanked me and signed the CD for me. They ended up being non-other than the Dixie Chicks ... and Oh by the way the lead singer was replaced before they went big time.<br/><br/>Just two examples but I have had many similar occurrences over the years.

You will notice this from the very first scene (incidentally my personal favourite Shakespeare scene) but I do not think that this distracts from the plot or the quality of the great playwright himself.

All of the symbols used in he production were effective, if a little obvious, and all in all this film is slick and true to the original, down to even the minutest details. Even though little tributes to the original setting sometimes are a little 'in your face', they are nice, and further add to the sense of respect the film has for the play.<br/><br/>I am a great one for conventional, traditional performances of Romeo and Juliet, but I have to say that this is a very good film, and grips to the last, even though everyone knows what happens."

Cut them some slack, they are both 2 very talented young actors and for this being their first time doing a Shakespeare film, they did pretty damn well if you ask me. Their chemistry on screen was good, but it could've been better. I'd have to say that the parts they performed their best in were when they met across the fish tank (There was no dialogue, but their faces really said it all. I also thought that was very romantic), and the night before Romeo's banishment from Verona, in Juliet's room. The death scene was a surprising twist from the play, and it put me in tears.<br/><br/>But, I think they should've spent more time on the wedding scene.

","Romeo and Juliet set in a modern day urban environment with modern updates to all of the events but still with the original dialogue. OK then.

Baz Luhrmann makes the film visually stunning, and manages to fill it with gripping action scenes and touching romantic moments. A mixture of a music video, teen romance, gritty urban drama and Shakespeare, this will be a bit jarring to many (Myself included) but the ambition of the movie is to be admired. Claire Danes is OK but a bit annoying, while Leonardo DiCaprio owns the movie. The cinematography is stunning, and the film never stops being lovely to look at.<br/><br/>It's not perfect though. Elements of the play such as the scene where Lord Capulet is angry with Juliet and Romeo and Mecrutio's friendship are poorly handled, and the endless visual dazzle, beautiful as it is, can send the film into style over substance territory. The presentation of Romeo and Juliet and other things in the play is beautifully updated for modern audiences and while the repeated action scenes can leave drama in the sidelines, the tragic ending still has a lot of emotional punch. It's not the best Shakespeare movie of all time, but I can't dislike an urban drama which still channels Shakespeare so effectively.<br/><br/>7/10"

It looked like Claire Danes was wearing less makeup than DiCaprio, which shows because she's ugly. Fortunately, Romeo was supposed to be high when he fell in love with her, so that makes it slightly more credible.<br/><br/>As far as the whole Shakespearean dialogue goes it is slightly out of place and would be very strange in most movies.

However as a result the tone of the actors is wrong- for much of the film the cast sound as though they are about to break into laughter. 1990's teenagers reading 15th century literature in this tone simply doesn't work. It is in this that the adaptation loses its power, by diminishing the power of the original story Luhrmann's film has nothing but lots of fancy, overly stylised camera work?oh and Leo, which speaks volumes for the success of the film.

","Romeo + Juliet is a failed attempt to modernize Shakespeare's classic play written all the way back in 1591. Its glossy production, awkward mix of old and new, and newer technology added to give it the ""present"" feel completely destroys the love aspect of the film and turns it into a goofy and lame adaptation of one of literature's many classics.<br/><br/>Obviously, this was meant for kids who don't like reading, but like action films. The scenes are loaded with primary colors and the action rarely ceases. The acting is beyond over-dramatic, and turns the characters into buffoons who barely represent their respected characters in the play.<br/><br/>The nail that seals the coffin is the film's mix of the old and the new style. It can't decide if it wants to fully change Shakespeare's work, or keep some in and some out. We get a messy result. The film hybrids over using pistols instead of swords and car chases to entertain ones who believe the play is ""boring."" To cover up the madness and chaos exploding on screen we get annoying and volume enhanced rock tunes that are out of place and just a complete and total waste of time. I would have never thought Radiohead would've made it in a film titled Romeo + Juliet.<br/><br/>The storyline is kept pretty much the same; Romeo and Juliet are star-crossed lovers who desperately want to be together. Romeo coming from the Montague household and Juliet from the Capulets, have known that their parents have had an ongoing rivalry forever but can't help but find solace in each other.<br/><br/>Despite its age and overall outdated language, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has managed to leach itself into the school curriculum year after year. The book is in no way a bad read. I found some parts hard to understand, but I was caught up within a few minutes. It does involve re-reading and your full attention.<br/><br/>The book is very outdated in terms of dialog. Obviously, no body says ""Where for art thou, mother"" in 2011. The most important aspect of a book is being able to read it and comprehend what it is telling you. Sometimes, that can be a task for current readers of the play. But with internet and technology at its peak I'm sure understanding it will be no problem.<br/><br/>I'm in no way bashing the book. I found it to be quite enjoyable and quite sad, but sometimes I kind of wish I knew what was happening instead of assuming. Still, the play is the grand-daddy of literature. I can except that, and I'm glad I read it.<br/><br/>With actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, and John Leguizamo I can only imagine how this film would've played out if it was made with some level of seriousness. It has been so long since we saw a new R&J adaptation, you'd think one would be remade again to fill the void.<br/><br/>What really kills this film, is the dialog. It keeps in place lots of Shakespeare speak. It is not only laughable, but questionable. First you want to completely modernize the film, then you want to keep the dialog. Maybe in someone's head it sounds pretty amusing, on film, it is atrocious and unable to take seriously. Especially when the film pans shots of some unnamed fat guy sitting on a lawnchair with no shirt on. Seriously? Romeo + Juliet is definitely a unique adaptation, but it is absolutely a horrendous turnout. Anyone in school watching this will likely be amused by its quirky take on the play and find it way more entertaining than the play itself because of its more blatant style. Shakespeare fans will be greatly letdown by the film's mockery of the play's tragedy. It is definitely a stain on Leo's filmography, and the rest of the cast's.<br/><br/>Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Rudd, Christina Pickles, and Jesse Bradford.

While no one else knows of the union Romeo intervenes in an argument between his friends and Tybalt, one of the Capulets; he refuses to fight even when Tybalt attacks him. Coming to Romeo's defence his friend Mercutio is killed by Tybalt who in tern is slain by Romeo. For this crime Romeo is banished and Juliet's parents arrange for her to be married to another suitor not knowing she is already wed. To solve the problem the priest gives Juliet a drug that will make her appear dead and writes a letter to Romeo explaining the situation. Romeo does not get this letter and when he hears Juliet is dead he returns to Verona and takes poison himself. Juliet wakens as he is taking it but by then it is too late; he is dying, she then takes his gun and shoots herself.<br/><br/>Director Baz Luhrmann has brought a new twist to this old story; setting it in the present day. Surprisingly the Shakespearian language doesn't seem out of place, instead it comes across as the local dialect and references to 'swords' continue to work as we are shown that they are makes of guns. Leonardo diCaprio and Claire Danes are great in the lead roles; there is a real chemistry between their characters. Harold Perrineau is also notable as Mercutio; his opening scene is one that once seen you will never forget he is in drag wearing a silver costume, matching wig and bright red lipstick! Forcing school children to study the scripts often spoils Shakespeare; it was always intended to be watched as it is performed; in his day on the stage but now film brings another way to see it. This version might not be the most traditional but I think it could be one of the best ways of introducing somebody to his works."

The baseline of the story of Romeo & Juliet was told well.<br/><br/>As an actor and Shakespeare fan, I disliked the film. It was too different to the original.

The famous balcony scene was far from perfect.<br/><br/>If you are a movie fan and u know a bit about Romeo & Juliet, then I strongly recommend you watching this.<br/><br/>If you are, as I, an actor/ actress and really enjoy the proper Shakespeare's masterpieces and really want to see how the prose and iambic pentameter is read, then I recommend you to watch the Romeo & Juliet film of 1968 directed by Franco Zeffirelli.<br/><br/>I hoped this review has helped."

These effects are perfectly complimented by the memorable performances delivered by the lead actors, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.  This is undeniably one of DiCaprio's finest portrayals, showing talent only seen previously in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"".<br/><br/>In comparision to the many other adaptations of this famous tragedy, Baz Luhrmann's certainly ranks with the best.

","I write this review because I like this movie and would like to clear up some of the misunderstandings of some of the reviews.  People look at this film with a much too narrow scope.  This does so many things for Romeo and Juliet as one of the best works in the history of man, and for Baz whom without we would not even being using the word musical in association with film in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Let's start with what it does for R and J as a story.  I am currently 21 and I can honestly tell you that until R and J was recreating by Baz the luster of the story was wearing off.  It was old out dated with sword fights with no imagination or description.  As it was written around 500 years ago (that number maybe wrong but who cares ""a long time ago) it boring stupid love story that could not even be fathomed to happen today.  However after the newest production of Romeo and Juliet it not only is comprehendible but the story has faces that most people can relate to.  The pain and anguish of Leo's Romeo and the refined passion of Claire's Juliet.  That is what this ""adaptation"" did it brought the story to the people that matter most, the kids and young people.  We are growing up in not so innocent times so wasn't it time to have a not so innocent Romeo and Juliet?<br/><br/>Second is Baz a revolutionary filmmaker.  Yes R and J is an old story so are all his films but the way they are told is new and revolutionary.  Yes some older people squirm with the jump cuts, quick cuts, and fast action film. That is fine but the Mtv generation doesn't as much.  He is taking classical work from his time on the stage and bringing it to the masses.  He is truly a filmmaker of the people and without him musicals would have been something made in the 30's 40's 50's and 60's now it is an accademy award winning form.<br/><br/>Therefore, calm down.  The world is not coming to an end. For the purists, your Shakespeare is not rolling over in his grave.  Rather, he is smiling because some finally got the courage to stand up to his work and bring it to a new time.  Baz shouldn't be reprimanded for his work but commended.

","First I'd like to begin by saying that my all time favorite Romeo and Juliet ever put on film is the 1968 version by Franco Zeffirelli starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. I saw that movie on late night TV once when I was a graduate student in Toronto in 1998. I am not embarassed to say that I bawled for an hour afterwards and since then it has left an indelible impression on my mind.<br/><br/>This movie is set in the 90's and hence the location and the character portrayal is appropriate. Danes and DiCaprio are the precise choice for this movie. And I was also pleased to see that the original shakesperean dialogue is employed. However, the dialogue is not followed faithfully, some of the choicest passages are missing. I was particularly grieved to find that in the balcony scene Romeo's entry passage was cut short. ""R: .... See how she lean's her cheek upon her hand, O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek...."" is missing. So is ""J: ....But to be frank and give it thee again, My bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep, The more I give to thee the more I have for both are infinite,  I hear some noise within, dear love adieu...."" is also missing. These are only some examples. The balcony scene is one of the most important scenes in R & J, Luhrman should have left it unabridged. That's the only complaint I have, otherwise this movie is perfect. The last scene in the church caught me by surprise. I always thought that Juliet wakes after Romeo dies (without knowing that she is alive). Luhrman has done an exceptional job in simultaneously filming Romeo's death and Juliet's coming alive. It makes the ending so much more poignant. I highly recommend this movie. But to anybody who hasn't seen the 1968 version, please go rent the DVD or even better buy it!<br/><br/>""Goodnight, as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast."""

","I just finished watching the movie about ten minutes ago, so it's pretty fresh in my mind. Odd. Very, very odd. Perhaps I'm biased due to the fact that I have a strong dislike for DiCaprio, but that was very odd. The costuming was--way out there somewhere. It was put together oddly. The death scene (which to me broke the show)--gosh, why not keep it the way Shakespeare had written it? There was no Paris/Romeo tryst (I suppose that would be a bit abstract with guns--yet another of the movie's downfalls), and Juliet woke up before Romeo was completely dead! I saw a very real TITANIC flash-back right about then--must he do all his death scenes the same? Mercutio was made to be MUCH too annoying in my opinion, so I felt it hard to pity Romeo when his best friend is killed.

","(There may be spoilers here, but not too big unless you don't have any idea of the plot of Romeo and Juliet) I may first add that I am a huge Shakespeare fan. I usually love all productions that have anything to do with any one of Shakespeare's plays. This cannot be Shakespeare's work. May I also add that I loved Moulin Rouge. I thought Nicole Kidman was stunning, that though it must have been a challenge to direct, it was well done. This cannot have been Baz Luhrmann's work. First of all, who thought of casting Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo? He obviously, as always, can't act.<br/><br/>Second, in the opening scene (I don't consider this to be a spoiler because everybody knows the general story) the two families get in a brawl at a gas station. May I add that the director overlooked the fact that if a match is lit and dropped in gasoline, the entire building would blow up? But no, of course, it only catches on fire.<br/><br/>Third, it was a mistake to ""adapt"" Shakespeare's words. All the lines in the movie were in the play, but huge sections were cut out. I don't even recall hearing a ""Oh, happy dagger.""<br/><br/>The acting reminds me of a soap opera I saw when I lived in England: Neighbors. It is the worst melodrama I had ever seen. I thought nothing could be worse than that show. Then I saw this movie. In the opening scene, they mimic old westerns, romantic comedies, and thrillers, and fail at all three.<br/><br/>I must give credit, however, to the person who cast Claire Danes as Juliet. She was stunning, and fits the part perfectly. I have rarely heard a person speak the lines as well as she did, with perfect feeling.<br/><br/>The sex scene (Okay, you knew it was coming, it's not a spoiler. I mean, the movie has DiCaprio in it!)was stupid. It was so predictable, yet somehow unbelievable.<br/><br/>I wish the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio had been better. If it had, I might have been able to reccomend this solely for Claire Danes' excellent work. Sadly, I cannot recommend it as he alone can scar your eyes.<br/><br/>Also, why did Luhrmann make Romeo take a pill before the party? And he's suddenly fine after throwing up, washing his face, and seeing Juliet? I'm sorry, but even marijuana lasts longer than that!<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend this movie unless you want a shot at directing a soap opera (You could pick up a lot of tips from this movie.)

","I'm one of Shakespeare's biggest fans.  Ask anybody, it's true.  So, when I heard about a contemporary adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, I initially thought ""What?  Why mess with what's perfect?"" I was wrong.  This film does what other versions fail to: inject the passion and power that you could only usually find in your own head as you read the text.  This is as the stage performances must have seemed like to the first audiences. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I still always find myself praying that the lovers do not meet their destiny, and that is a testament to how involved one can feel with the characters and story line.  True, most of that is down to the Bard himself, but I think Baz, DiCaprio and Danes need a lot of credit too. Only staunch traditionalists and imbeciles could find any fault with this colourful, heart-racing, heart-wrenching masterpiece. Stand not amazed?  You must be joking!<br/><br/>BTW:  I hate West Side Story.  I hate all musicals, but that one had me nearly crying as I laughed at the 'aggressive' fight-dancing hilarity.

"andrewheins","Null","0","0","2 March 2003"," The Most Misunderstood Film to Date
","Romeo + Juliet<br/><br/>Before watching this movie you have to take into account 2 things. First: Shakespeare is dead. He has been for a long time, and all that's left are plays. Because of this, people take these plays and adapt them in their head according to the life that they live TODAY everytime they read them, and almost never on purpose. Secondly: Shakespeare's work is also dead. It's has gone from being unparalelled artistry to being force-fed to students all through school in it's original form with little to no room for interpretation.<br/><br/>With those two things in mind, we come to this film. The title of the film is a lie - this is not William Shakespeare's work. Personally I think the title is a brilliant irony - It cannot be Shakespeare's work, Shakespeare is dead (see point one). So what we have here is an adaptation of the work ""Romeo and Juliet"" that tries to take a dead work and bring it back to life.<br/><br/>
IF YOU REFUSE TO TAKE THE FILM AS SUCH DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE<br/><br/>With that cleared up, Baz is trying to adapt Romeo and Juliet and is aiming for a target audience that HATES SHAKESPEARE. The adolescent mind sees Shakespeare and thinks an hour long, butt-numbing class where an old prof recites the same lesson he's given umpteen million times.<br/><br/>
Needless to say, to make aim for this audience was a high goal to set in the first place. Can you even imagine the production studio's response to this? I'd wager it was hard for Baz to find anyone willing to produce this film.<br/><br/>With all of this in mind, we come to the question of ""Was this film a success?"", and in EVERY SINGLE aspect, it was. He took a work that kids hate and made them love it. He did it with style and flair, produced something no one had ever seen before, and just about cleaned house at the box office.<br/><br/>
So if you're going to bitch about this ""not being true to the play"" or that ""it fails because of the dialogue's datedness"" then you're wasting your breath. If you want Shakespeare, go read the book, they're everywhere. If you want to see an incredible piece of film that KNOWS it's an incredible piece of film, then watch Baz leave every other Shakespeare adaptation on the dusty old shelves of the Used Movies rack."

I love how the play was modernized to attract the youth of today. I know I loved it! Some people might not like this movie, ie: people who do not like change. But, if you are like me and you like modern culture and Shakespeare, then you will probably enjoy this."

"alibrown18","Null","0","0","31 January 2003"," Is this Shakespeare? Or is this a film?
","Luhrmann's film has a specific audience in mind (15-25). In this respect the dynamic cinematography, compression of action and, most importantly, the excellent casting of Di Caprio and Danes mean the film achieves its pragmatic ambition of reaching, and entertaining, a group perhaps otherwise naïve of Shakespeare's text. In promoting a visual poetic above the dialogic, Luhrmann diverts attention from much of Shakespeare's language. However, given that Shakespeare was to a large extent drawing his dialogue from conventionalised courtly speech, and parodying these ways of speaking, it would be unfair to criticise Luhrmann for this. If Shakespeare can alter the speech modes of others to suit his audience, Luhrmann can alter Shakespeare's language to suit his medium. Di Caprio does lack sensitivity to the pentameter but given the target audience this should not be a criticism, for his visual presence and the obvious chemistry between him and Danes substitute the quality of Shakespeare's lines for a more immediate emotive effect. This is an excellent film and the fact that purists will claim that this is not Shakespeare proves the film has achieved its goal. For this is not designed as a film of Shakespeare but as a piece of cinema in its own right. And the standard of its success is not as an interpretation of Shakespeare, but how well it is received by a cinema audience who might then use this film as a way into the authentic poet."

","The way this was adapted was very clever - using the original Shakespeare dialogue, but 'updating' it to modern times was incredible. What an idea! It's so much more interesting than watching a costume drama with Romeo in tights or something. I like the way that instead of having swords, their guns are called 'swords'. Very clever. <br/><br/>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes are perfectly cast as the star-crossed lovers. They look exactly the right ages for the parts, and the chemistry is amazing. You actually believe that these two are in love, and they're not just getting married for the sheer heck of it. The swimming pool kissing scene is exciting and sexy - the way it feels like it should be. But my favourite scene has got to be when they first lay eyes on each other. What a beautiful way to 'introduce' the pair to each other. Through the glass of a giant fish tank. The first time I saw that I almost fell in love with the both of them - it was so emotional and created such an atmosphere of the love between them. It was perfectly done. Leonardo's performance as Romeo was one of the best of his career - back then when he still looked like a skinny 18 year old. His tears brought tears to my eyes - the bit where he drinks the poison in front of Juliet and she touches his cheek - his reaction is heart breaking. And probably the part that made me cry the most was when Tybalt kills his best friend Mercutio, and he's crouching over his dead body crying.<br/><br/>Baz Lurhman revitalised the classic play and made it into a fantastic movie for the MTV generation. Every Shakespeare film should be like this one."

"stargaser","10","0","0","4 November 2002"," Emotional rollercoaster
","Shakespeare is one of the most prolific and talented playwrite's in all history.  His work has been translated into countless languages, has been endlessly analyzed and discussed.  There are so many adaptations of his work that it's impossible to name or even remember them all.  So it must take an extraordinary cast, a visionary director and plenty of hard work to achieve a modern adaptation worthy of having Shakespere's name in the title.  Buz Luhrmann and company more than meet the challenge of re-telling this classic story of star-crossed lovers into a modern rendition. I was priveledged enough to see this wonderful movie on the big screen in 1996, and now 6 years 1 VHS cassette, 2 DVD's (original and special edition),  1 book, 2 cassette and 1 CD soundtracks later I find myself just as moved by the movie today as I was 6 years ago.  Buz Luhrmann and the cast take you on an incredible emotional ride.  From the beginning you feel overwhelmed as you try to embrace the visual and audible power of the film, but as the movie progresses you discover that you become intune with the pace of the movie and the characters.  Suddenly you hardly notice that the movie is actually utilizing old english language and that the play is actually 400 years old and you discover that you're relating to the characters and the story as though it was written for our generation.  It is as though Romeo and Juliet were frozen in time until now and are re-living their lives in the modern times for us onscreen. I could go on and on about the movie and how it manages to captivate you for the entire 2 hours.  I could discuss how the film takes you on the emotional rollercoaster from the hate driven rivalry in the opening, to the frolicing atmosphere of the Capulet bash, from the passionalte kisses in the pool, to the tragic and powerful ending that leaves you sobbing.  I could, but I won't because that would take ages.  Instead I'm going to say that this movie is definitely worth your time.  The cast is spectacular and Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes just shine as Romeo and Juliet.  Buz Luhrmann is a true visionary combining a rich character driven classic play with the lavish visionary feast for the eyes.  All that combined with the incredible soundtrack from many talented artists and you have a bonafide winner. Watch it for yourself and you be the judge.  My rating is 10 out of 10."

","Let me tell you, when I started my Freshmen year of Highschool this year, and found out that the first play we were reading was Romeo + Juliet, I moaned and groaned and nearly chewed up my pencil in annoyance. Sure, I found the play compelling, and I knew exactly what it was about, but Old English text really annoys me. Well, we finally finish the story, watch a fairly good 16th century version of the R+J play, and then....MODERN DAY VERSION!!!!! (yes, we watched this movie in my 4th period English class)<br/><br/>Ever since I was 9 and this movie came out I've wanted to see it. Just never the chances. I've always passed it in the video stores, but still didn't pick it up. But now here's the chance. From the very beginning everyone (even the guys) was hooked on the film. We knew exactly what would happen. But still we were anxious to watch on. Even though it's still hard to understand a little bit because of the Old English talk, it's not that hard to follow. The play had me rolling with laughter, watching with a complete blank expression anticipating the next scene, or flowing with tears. It was great. The beginning had to be my favorite scene, and the Capulet party.<br/><br/>
Although I do wish it had a modern script that way it was easier to understand, but it doesn't really take away the entire flavor. What counts is I LOVE (LOVE!) this movie!!! I have to get it on DVD. The actors do an amazing job- Tybalt and Mercutio are my favorites in this movie. It would be awesome if another R+J adaption was made (with a modern script please).<br/><br/>

One thing, you stay absolutely true to the Shakespearan original plot, cenarios, etc. (but obviously it wouldn't appeal to the public it set out to appeal) or you do a modern adaptation and bring the story to a modern context.<br/><br/>The idea of reading 16th century baroque dialogues while shootings go on and fast cars roam just seems extremely strange and intriguing. It just feels like an unfortunate mix Shakespeare's undisputed prestige and action movie's undeniable attraction that doesn't really work that well.<br/><br/>The two things are simply very different.

Dicaprio as Romeo Montague gives a truly remarkable performance with talent well beyond his years.<br/><br/>Lurman captures the true essence of the play. He keeps almost to the exact dialogue catting parts where he sees fit. It flows well with not to many long sonnets, which drag on so long, that you start to question your sanity. The film progresses well and is understandable with the dialogue being clearly spoken. The score is a true credit with the music being a huge credit to the feel and intensity of the movie. Especially in the scenes in the church with the choir which a beautifully sung and just add another dimension. I love the water. The fish tank scene, Juliet's opening scene in the bath, Romeo's cure to the love drug, the pool scenes at the Capulet's Mansion, and many more including getting the actors wet as often as possible, using rain ect. The transformation from an Elizabethan period to the today was easily believable. With replacing Fair Verona with Verona Beach and Family brawling with Gang War.

Oh, and the actors have no idea what they're saying (what was up with Mercutio?)I hate Leo, but I'm forced to admit he was one of the film's best actors (and that's sad.)John Leguizamo was a cute (and good looking) Tybalt, but would have made a better Mercutio (since he usually plays comedic roles) and I still don't get why Tybalt's making out with his aunt in the party scene, but whatever. Oh, and Mercutio being on drugs is so not funny. Is it trying to say that people can't be witty or creative unless they're on drugs. I mean I'll be the first to admit that the Queen Mab speech is bizarre and random, but give Mercutio some credit here...he's not a drugged up loser. But despite the butchering of the text, the acting, and the really lame Shakespeare in-jokes (The ""Globe Theatre"" pool hall, Merchant of Verona Beach etc.)the film was flashy, colorful, and bizarre enough to keep my attention and make me laugh(kind of reminds you of Moulin Rouge hmmmm?)Basically if you view it as a comedy it works-and there's a few well done scenes (the opening fight scene(although the Cap. servants Samson and Gregory were turned into Monts.and vice versa), the Tybalt death scene, and parts of the fight scene.) In conclusion I still hold that the best R+J ever was Marin Shakespeare Company's teen show with our raver Montagues, swinger Capulets, punk rocker Friar Laurence, and a sexy blonde very female Tybalt that might have some unresolved feelings for her favorite bad boy aka Mercutio (you know they really would make a good couple!)Anyway if we want traditional serious Shakespeare don't look here, but if you want to laugh your ass off then this will do the trick.

","There are some spoilers here for those who've never, ever heard about this play. <br/><br/>Often used as a blueprint for movies through the decades, never has Shakespeare's play about the true essence of love been brought to life in such spectacular, breathtaking fashion. Baz Luhrman does it again. In this case, he takes the Bard's play and transfers it to our times, our world. Yes, there has been a string of teen-movies based on classic literature recently (Clueless, Cruel Intentions, 10 Things I Hate About You, etc.), but where Luhrman goes further than everyone else is by actually taking Shakespeare's language along for the ride. And, surprisingly, it works. He knows how to pick the right lines of the play, to convey meaning understandable beyond its archaic words. And thus, when Mercutio (Romeo's best friend and the only drag queen I've ever seen in a Shakespeare) uses his dying breath to lay ""a plague on both your houses"", the immediate sense of foreboding makes itself powerfully known. More so, Luhrman even dares to play with these very words to add a unique sense of humour to high drama, as when a light in the Capulet's mansion goes on and Romeo says: ""What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."" But neither the occasional jest nor the almost comic-book like style of the movie's photography ever divert the attention away from the impending tragedy. The sheer force of the emotional build-up is astonishing - and serves as proof that Shakespeare's work transcends space and time."
"mickk-1","8","0","0","18 March 2002"," A stunning look at a classic story
","Film makers adapting Shakespeare for the screen usually run into two initial problems. Do they stay close to the original, more or less putting a play on film? Or do they update either dialogue or setting, or both? Baz Luhrmann has chosen the latter course, updating the setting while leaving the dialogue pretty much faithful to the original. The look of the picture is stunning. Modern day Verona seems both familiar and yet somehow strange. Ornate weapons and customized cars give it an otherworldly feel, while sweeping visuals and fast cut editing combine with a strong soundtrack that at times breaks into the action on screen, Mercutio's performance at the Capulet party is a prime example of this. The use of the original dialogue could have been more problematic, particularly when combined with a modern setting. Many people find it an effort to follow this type of language but they should make that effort, it can be very worthwhile. Just picking up the rhythm of the words can make you realize why Shakespeare's work has lasted so long. It is not just the stories, but also the way they are told. These two elements, sublime language plus a stunning visual design are well served by an excellent cast. Claire Danes is very good as Juliet, a little shrill at times, but she is playing a fourteen year old. As Romeo Leonardo DiCaprio is also good, but it is the strong performances of the cast as a whole that help make the picture what it is. Inventive, innovative and exciting"

"rivercityrandom","8","0","0","28 February 2002"," Is this a Glock I see before me?
","It seems so odd and yet so natural that so many people would return to ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" and comment mightily in its favor only after seeing Baz Luhrmann's more recent masterpiece ""Moulin Rouge.""  When I first saw this film as a teenager in 1996, having been raised on more ""refined"" versions of Shakespeare's plays, I remember being outraged at how Hollywood was raping the words of the immortal Bard, taking them out of context in order to make a buck.  However, viewing this film under the lens of ""Moulin Rouge,"" it all makes sense to me now.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann, like Shakespeare, is a man of the theater, very bombastic, intense, and infused with showmanship.  The reviewers who panned ""R + J"" for its lack of period costume seem to forget that Shakespeare himself wasn't exactly a stickler for historical accuracy.  Shakespeare's plays bridged the gap between the historical periods they purported to represent and the Elizabethan mores of his day.  You will notice that while the plays are set in places like ancient Rome and medieval Scotland, the actors in Shakespeare's day didn't wear kilts or togas--they are wearing Renaissance-era jerkins and tights.  Luhrmann recognizes this, and sets his ""fair city of Verona"" in a world both modern, ancient and fantastical, where street gangs with ultramodern convertibles wield ornately decorated guns (named ""Sword"" and ""Rapier"" to fit with the 17th-century lyrics) against a backdrop of towering skycrapers and Gothic cathedrals, where TV newscasters compete with numerous images of Mexican-Catholic iconography, and where knights and angels fall in love in a spectacular Victorian mansion complete with tap-dancing butlers and a cross-dressing Mercutio diva. The story itself is told as intensely as the intense love between the star-crossed duo, through a bright mix of radical cinematography, using a mix of rapid cuts, pans, wipes, fades, blurs, and hallucinogenic imagery in a kaleidoscopic style reminiscent of music videos.  The film is also punctuated through a self-conscious choice of color.  Each scene has its own color scheme: scenes between the lovers are shot in a faded pastel color scheme reminiscent of colorized 19th century photographs, the gang battles are displayed in a violent mix of yellows and reds, the death scene... oh, sorry...<br/><br/>
*** SPOILER ***<br/><br/>yes, Romeo and Juliet both die, as if you didn't know<br/><br/>*** END SPOILER ***<br/><br/>fades from glorious color to a cinema-noir black and white.  This panoply of architecture, costume design, and film style serve to highlight the timelessness and timeliness of the Shakespearean drama, bringing it down from the pedestal of elite literature and lavishing it onto the ""penny-farthings,"" the ordinary folk, where it belongs.  Baz Luhrmann brings theatrical art to a movie industry lost in its own sense of commercialism and self-importance, and to a genre (Shakespearean film) that often seems to be ""more matter with less art"".<br/><br/>In retrospect, it's obvious from the vivid display of the extremes of human emotion and the dramatic conflict between the Elizabethan dialogue and the modern setting that this movie knows that it is a movie, a self-conscious entertainment pop-culture product, rather than displaying the events with a false sense of truthfulness and subliminal emotional manipulation. This one fact makes ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" a lot more honest than most ""realistic"" movies today."

Everyone knows the story of Romeo and Juliet, without having to have read the book or watch any of the films previously made, but it is still a timeless classic. The music and the costume work together to establish the modernization while the dialogue stays the same - pretty dangerous, yes, but it works.

Most of the actors in this version didn't have a clue.<br/><br/>
Leonardo DiCaprio looks all right but many of his lines are unintelligible and delivered in an annoying whine.  Claire Danes gives a horridly flat performance and she appears not to know what the words mean. Both of them suffer from a continual bad hair day which ultimately distracts from the romance and fantasy. The final scene is the best that either of them achieve, but that's due to Luhrmann's brilliant stage timing.<br/><br/>
Paul Sorvino is so ridiculously over the top as a mafioso Capulet that it is almost laughable.  And why does Mrs. Capulet have a southern accent??? John Leguziamo as Tybalt is also hard to understand and too one dimensional in his villainy.  Brian Denehey looks bored with the whole project. And the guy plaing the Prince (a sort of police chief) just shouts all the time; an unfortunate, unintended parody of perceived African-American social baldness.<br/><br/>The best performances in the movie are Pete Postelwaite's sensative Friar and the young Paul Rudd as Paris who proves that teenage actors CAN articulate the Shakespearean language.<br/><br/>Frankly Luhrmann chose these actors to sell tickets to teenie boppers and for that, I guess (since it probably lured masses of teens to a Shakespeare play)we should thank him.  It's just too bad that it ruined his movie.<br/><br/>Could he have done better?  Certainly! Robert Sean Leonard looks as good as DiCaprio and would have made the words meaningful. And any number of seasoned Shakespearean actors (young and old) could have done these roles within Luhrmann's concept and made more sense of the text.<br/><br/>So a really interesting attempt ruined by incompetent casting. I'll stick with Moulin Rouge; there the casting is superb!"

","A gorgeous and lavish production - a riot of colour and movement. The only fault? Da Caprio is no Shakespearian actor - too light weight in presentation, no force behind the dialogue. At times his voice seemed weak and he spoke a little too fast; in short, he appeared uncomfortable in the part. Apart from that this version of the classic is one of the best I have seen."
"RobMontu","10","0","0","23 January 2002"," Baz Luhrman: the only man in hollywood who understands Shakespeare?
","I was always a fan of Shakespeare. And since 'Moulin Rouge', of Mr. Baz Luhrman. I have seen 'Strictly Ballroom' quite a few times and 'Moulin Rouge' more than any other film ever, most likely.<br/><br/>And so, why not see Romeo + Juliet, the one film in which the two combine? Well, maybe because there has never been a good adaptation of the play to film- never.<br/><br/>The 1936 one, a bore, the 1968 one, terrible, the others, well, the others most of the people I know of agree- sucks.<br/><br/>Except for 'Westside Story', which is, after all, not the play, just the story, and even then, one of the lesser musicals.<br/><br/>William Shakespeare is NOT the spectacle Hollywood would want you to believe, in fact, it isn't even the spectacle this film would leave you to believe, but nonetheless it's my honest opinion that this film IS one William Shakespeare- not in the historical context but in the context of the spirit. As Baz continually said during the commentary, track to 'Moulin Rouge', he wasn't interested in creating the real-world Moulin Rouge of 1900, or in this case the real play, on it's opening night, but rather the feel of it, for today's, modern, audience, particularly the young, hip, teens and 20-somethings, who need such aid better than anyone else.<br/><br/>
And lets picture what that opening night would've been like. Entering `The Globe Theatre', us- the slimy peasants, with natty hair, dirty skin, smelly armpits, and hair- everywhere, even the ladies. Paying cheap prices for the cheap seats, right down in front. Not only right down in front, but on the dirt, with rats, worms, and other such creatures of the night. Ready to watch a play by one Shakespeare, we'd seen plays of his before, and enjoyed them, and excitement is building. The curtain comes up- the play begins, little scenery, costumes and props, just the words, and the actors to say them. We, such unintelligent low-life's, listen to them closely, understanding every word of poetry, hanging on to every syllable, the words filling our souls, the excitements building, and we're whisked away on and unending dream of hope, love, violence, and hate, as we have never done before, or ever will. The doomed were not kings, not emperors, not generals, or pharos, not even truly aristocrats yet, just young lovers, hopeless dreamers, slight eccentrics, as we all once were, and hoped to be again. And for the hour or two of the play's duration we were, and when they died, when it ended we wept not just for them, but also for ourselves.<br/><br/>
This is what a truly good movie does to us, happy or sad, this is what there meant to do. Like 'Citizen Cane',  'Intolerance', 'Greed', or for a lighter fix, 'Singing in the Rain', 'A Hard Days Night', 'Moulin Rouge', and most certainly 'Romeo + Juliet'.<br/><br/>We go in, our jobs bugging us, the stress killing us, fear overriding us, to find sticky floors, chewing gum, and crusty popcorn. The lights gently come down, the sound, abruptly comes up, in one of those annoying THX sound blast things, and suddenly, the world changes, specks of light, sound, blacks and whites, all the colors of the rainbow, flash onto the screen in an unendingly magical mesh of sights, sounds, emotions. The story doesn't matter- if it did then this film wouldn't be here, the play would've been forgotten long from now- it's pulp drivel, violence and contrived love for the entertainment of peasants, back long before you were born. But the sights overwhelm you; the sounds fill your ear, the listen to every note, grasp every frame, and are whisked up on a journey of hope, love, violence, and hate. Thanks to the film and to the words, you become a teen-ager once again feeling love for the first time, and when they die, you weep, not just for them, but also for yourself.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrman is the only man, woman even, in Hollywood, or the world over, who truly understands William Shakespeare and his work, or at least attempted to bring it to the screen with such a true understanding, with the possible and quite notable exceptions of the cast and crew involved in the making, producing, and writing of this film, (a statement which has a two exceptions of it's own, dear Claire and Leo, who play the leads.)<br/><br/>They created a film, which brings to us, today, what the play was to them, yesterday, and those before them, and those before them, all the way to that very first performance.<br/><br/>The cinematography, lighting, editing, sets, and what not are some of the best if not the best I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The music is absolutely brilliant, even including a few minor musical numbers using modern pop songs, as Baz and his team did later in Moulin Rouge.<br/><br/>And then I guess we're forced to move onto the acting which is quite good, but quite a few of the lines are muddled, yelled, are meshed all together- but that is of no importance, for what word was to the peasants, the visuals, score, and sound effects are to us thus placing the word- useless.<br/><br/>
Now of course that view might place some out of favor of this review but trust me, the film would be equally poetic with or without the work of the great Shakespeare. But the attitude would not.<br/><br/>This film is brilliant in all manners and if you dislike it your probably one of those `Shakespeare Purists' who think that Romeo & Juliet should be paraded in the fashion it was meant for with sets, costumes and stars the Globe would have never afforded, and using true Italian actors, on an English play, but quite frankly, not to be rude, you are quite wrong in your theory, how should Shakespeare play, like any great thing, however it's interpreters wish, but for my money, the only one worth viewing, is this, or maybe Julie Taymor's Titus- especially if you liked this, and even more so if you didn't.<br/><br/>A film of wonder, majesty, grace, beauty, elegance, excitement, romance, love, comedy and violence, Romeo + Juliet is truly perfect, in an (admittedly) flawed way, but aren't all greats?<br/><br/>AND ALSO OF NOTE- SOMEWHAT OF A ***SPOILER***:  Many people have stated this films gang-war aspects were stolen from 'West-Side Story', but, if you really pay attention, the two houses in Romeo + Juliet are business rivals, their children, and friends of them, merely juvenile delinquents with some need to hate somebody and so the choose each other, due solely, to there families hate, just as in the original, relatively."

","The fact that I loved Moulin Rouge convinced me to see Romeo + Juliet, Baz Luhrmann's previous movie but I was a bit worried. First of all, Romeo and Juliet has never been my favorite Shakespeare tragedy. And the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio had the role of Romeo did not convince me either. He is not a terrible actor, but he is certainly not a great one. Well, luckily Luhrmann's name convinced me to see this very good version of the classic play. His directing is impressive. The actors also do a great job. Danes and Dicaprio are a great couple, and John Leguizamo is perfect as Tybalt. His performance convinced me, along with his role in the incredible Summer of Sam, that Leguizamo is an excellent actor, someone with the potential to be remembered as one of the great actors of his generation. The rest of the cast is also very good. Sure, there might be a bit too much screaming from time to time but the energy with which Luhrmann films everything makes it seem normal. As for the story, it is told with enough passion to make me forget about everything I dont like about it. All in all, this movie is worth your time, although if you are in the mood for Shakespeare at his best, watch Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version of Hamlet. But if you dont have time for this wonderful 4 hour epic, Romeo + Juliet is a dynamic version of a classic story.<br/><br/>78%"

","william shakespeare would be totally blown away by this reproduction of his play romeo and juliet. baz luhrman has creatively interpreted this play, producing a wierd yet funky and modern movie. the ideas which he has used in the movie really bring the play into the fore. the montagues and capulets are blown into total giants of verona and the religious theme is very strong and consistent acting as leit motif throughout the movie adding to final cathartic moment. the fact that the story is set in a sleazy slummy town contrasts the the nature of both romeo and juliet. it would not have worked had baz luhrman not used the original shakespeare text. rarely are other works of literature so amazingly and beautifully made into fabulous films. the direction is truly visionary, with excellent editing in parts, simple ideas such as giving the capulet boys a hispanic identity and the montague boys a rough and ready punky attitude. leonardo di caprio and clare danes become their characters, they have so much force and passion, leonardo however i feel is more expressive and feels more comfortable with the shakespearean text itself. and the soundtrack....it works so well with the movie, such a range of different artist,bringing a new element to the movie. this movie totally captures the shakespearean tragedy at its best!"

For example, the longsword was somewhat blatant.<br/><br/>My main criticism is that the movie still managed to feel slightly Hollywood sanitised.

","The newest version of Romeo + Juliet was a brave action on Baz Luhrmann's part. He did a very good job at targeting teens, especially with the MTV-like filming.  He really took Shakespeare to a new level with this movie.  Since Romeo and Juliet are known as the ideal lovers, bringing them into our time has made them seem less fictional as if we can still find our perfect husband or wife.  Keeping the poetry intact was rather jarring; however, without it it wouldn't be the same Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Some of the things that Luhrmann added were quite clever such as the names of ""Sword"" and ""Dagger"" for their guns.  He also added in some puns from other works of Shakespeare as the advertisements in and on stores.  The characters' archetypes were genius and easy to identify.  However, someone could have done a little better of a job teaching Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes how to recite Shakespeare because they could have done a better job; on the otherhand, DiCaprio as a the charming Romeo was not a bad choice at all.  Overall, this was a great movie and I think it succeeded in all of its efforts to capture the younger audiences eye and open up the wonderful world of Shakespeare."

","Romeo and Juliet is by far the most famous and favored love story of all time.  Shakespeare really did a good job writing this one, and Baz Lurhmann did an incredible job (I think), remaking this tragedy into a modern-time every-day teenage love story.  It basically takes place on a ""Verona Beach"" with guns, cars, and all that good 90's stuff. What made it such a good movie (I feel) was, not only the set-up, but the choir rendition of Prince's ""When Doves Cry.""  It gives the movie so much more meaning to a person who doesn't understand what the whole thing is about.  Which, by the way, is about 2 opposing families, (kind of like businesses), who are in battle with each other for money (I'm guessing?), and their two teenage kids fall in love with eachother.  The music, I feel, gives the movie a more modern type feel, such as an MTV music video.<br/><br/>The main reason why (I think) the movie is so good is because of its set-up.  You know, instead of olden-day sword-fighting, you have guns shooting, the two different clothes brands both the Capulets and Montagues wear (to keep them even more separated), and then the actors.  At the time, there probably couldn't be a better pair of actors to play the parts of Romeo and Juliet.  Leonardo DiCaprio did such an awesome job playing the part of Romeo, with his soft and cuddly side, and his raging anger-machine side.  They both show extremely well in this movie.  Then we have Claire Danes.  She did an awesome job also, playing Juliet.  Danes has this sweet and innocent look, and this well-determined mind that (I feel) is brought out most in this movie.  The character of Juliet is a sweet and innocent, yet determined young girl.  They did a very good job playing those characters."

","`William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet', directed by Baz Lurman, is a creative, imaginative, tale of `star-crossed lovers' that takes place in a city named Verona Beach. The main families, the Montagues and the Capulets are warring families who have been carrying century-old grudges. Their grudges are passed down to the next generation, where the boys find any small reason to fight. In the middle of this, Romeo Montague, the young philosopher, and Juliet Capulet, the elegant girl, who is naive of the real world, meet and fall in love. Due to the circumstances, they must keep it a secret, only known to Juliet's nurse and Friar Laurance, who agrees to secretly marry them. When tragedy strikes and Romeo is banished, things start to go wrong. From there, misunderstandings and quick judgements set the stage for the tear-jerking end. I give this movie 10 out of 10!!!

The beginning is so choppy and frantic - this is the world of the young men from two families, brawling on the streets. They live fast and irresponsibly, fighting because they always have, despite any attempts to stop them. Then it shifts into the dreamy romance of the two lovers. I like how Luhrmann put them into a pool, it was an interesting take on the scene. DiCaprio and Danes do have some trouble with their lines, but they actually look like they're in love. And they're appealing. My problem with the Zeffirelli version is the way that Juliet laughs and cries the EXACT same way, and FAR too often (it drives me nuts). But I digress.<br/><br/>I don't like how some people are trashing this movie as<br/><br/>a) Shakespeare for the MTV generation b) not the way Shakespeare intended it<br/><br/>Well, Shakespeare lived four hundred years ago... how do we know what he intended? Pardon me if I'm wrong in thinking that he meant his plays to be enjoyed. And let's face it (I know this, because I'm a high school student), a lot of teenagers think that Shakespeare sucks and that he has no relevance today. And with the way the arts are being trashed these days, whatever keeps his works around, appreciated, and recognized is good in my book. Plus, the movie didn't make a butchery of the play.

I saw it the first time late at night traveling and a bit bored and restless and from the first scene to the last I forgot the world and was twisted and pushed and amazed. You might be able to say any one actor--like Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo or Claire Danes as Juliet--is breathtaking, though many certainly are superb. What you find is the movie itself is the star, rapidly conjoining unlikely scenes and making individual contributions flare and sizzle in jarring succession. The filming, too--under veteran Donald McAlpine--is gorgeous and original without being distracting. <br/><br/>Shakespeare deserves some credit here, taking a classic problem and turning it into an archetypal drama. The problem is just when two people fall in love from different sides of the tracks. The drama, of course, is the eventual suicides out of pure love. If you don't know the story and I've ruined the ending, I'm sorry. (I won't say who kills themselves.)<br/><br/>See this? Yes. Yes. Yes. But be warned--it starts with such a bizarre boundary pushing adaptation of the classic confrontations in modern gang terms you might just say, woah, this is stupid and horrible. You really might.

Shakespeare's play is among the greatest ever written in English, but it was utterly ruined by the action. It was Ode to Joy done by a screamo band; it was Swan Lake done by break dancers.<br/><br/>Shakespeare's plays tell a story in moving and powerful ways, one of the reasons they can be read with nearly as much pleasure as may be gotten by seeing them performed on stage. The language tells the story, not the props, not the scenery, not even, particularly, the actors. In this version of the play, the language is lost. The props, scenery, and action overwhelm it. The dialogue, in the mouths of these actors, in the situations in which they deliver it, is utterly malapropos.<br/><br/>I've no idea why Mr Luhrmann made this film, but, in doing so, he did no service to either Shakespeare nor to his audiences.

They made Mercutio some sort of gay guy. That's what I got from it. And they cast Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo. They changed Benvolio's name to...Benevelo. And to top things off, they used the original language from the play. I HATE INCONSISTENCY. They watch TV in the middle of a beach. TV. ON A BLOODY BEACH! And Mercutio's death was handled absolutely terribly. And they called Paris ""Dave Paris"". DAVE?

I was excited to watch this version since I thought it would be good. I'm sorry, but it sucked.<br/><br/>This version of Romeo and Juliet kept bugging me. So is Luhrmann trying to say that in modern day Verona, people can just carry guns around and start shooting and the law isn't charged upon them? And the citizens don't care that their local gas station is on fire? Another thing: Hello Romeo and Juliet OPEN your eyes and look around. Oh my gosh, your NOT in Renaissance Italy! Your in modernized-and-updated Verona! There's money! There's cars! There's passports! And airplanes were invented nearly a century ago! <br/><br/>Consider those facts.

We all know about the *plot spoiler* ending with Romeo finding Juliet seemingly dead, killing himself before she wakes up and then kills herself, but did Baz Luhrman have to do it in such a silly way? The first example, is the set, which looks very dangerous. In fact it looks stupidly dangerous with all those candles around. No church would have that many candles lit and left unattended. If they had wanted to cremate her, why did they not have it done properly?! Next comes Romeo perched on the side of the bed. It's obvious that she's waking up. Her fingers move on his hand. She opens her eyes and she's grinning at him with a smile that is so white it could blind. Yet he drinks the poison and she tries to suck it off of his lips. She might have well stuck her tongue down his throat for all the good that it did. Then she eventually spots his gun and as calm as anything puts it to her head and fires. They end up just lying there dead together, with just a few splatters of blood. There would have been much more blood (and brain) than that. It just really annoyed me that what could have been a very emotional scene was so long drawn out and done in a way that shows that perhaps the star cross'd lovers only have a brain cells between them. I'm annoyed with that. (And Mercutio dying because he was just lovely)."

","Directed by Baz Luhrmann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, John Leguizamo, Dash Mihok, Miriam Margolyes, Paul Sorvino, Diane Venora, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Jesse Bradford. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Shakespeare's tale of doomed star-crossed lovers is updated to the modern age, transported to the Miami-esque city of Verona Beach, and given a gaudy MTV-style makeover so it can vulgarly pander to the youth market (coming up just short of giving the couple a crass gossip-rag nickname like ""Rom-liet""). A misguided conceit resulting in a headache-inducing mess that encapsulates the words of the Bard but produces none of the poetry; it may not desecrate the text, but the dialogue rarely comes to life coming out of the mouths of this cast (Postlethwaite being the chief exception, playing Father Laurence instead of Friar Laurence...even though he's still called a friar at one point because, well, that's the sort of care that was put into this ""adaptation""). DiCaprio's star qualities can't be denied and Perrineau's flamboyance is well-suited for Mercutio, but it's all drowned in hyperactive editing, lurid camera filters, sledgehammer symbolism, and tonal whiplash. Does feature a surprisingly effective soundtrack considering the eclectic mishmash of genres--buy the CD, skip the movie. Full title is ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" which is equal parts laughable and depressing, and less suitable than it would have been to release ""Jane Austen's Clueless"" the previous year. M. Emmett Walsh cameos as the Apothecary; Brian Dennehy also appears briefly as Romeo's father, but he has nothing to do (most of his scenes must have ended up on the cutting room floor).<br/><br/>36/100"

","I first saw this movie in highschool while studying Shakespeare in English literature and I was blown away by it's modernised visuals without compromising the original text such as switching swords for guns and having each one inscribed with the name of the blade in the text Tybalts gun is inscribed with Rapier on it Mercutios is inscribed with dagger so when they put up there swords to fight no text or dialogue is changed just the visuals while the movies modern theme's give this classic story a different interpretation while not changing the original text.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes that are a bit weird such as Mercutio cross dressing for the party at the Capulet mansion and Romeo dropping acid and having bad trip at the party but honestly they don't take away from the movies seriousness they just add a bit of comedy and weirdness to an otherwise great movie.<br/><br/>The story is pretty much the same as in the book word for word only a few minor differences and having visuals to illustrate the scenes and bring it to life like on stage in a play with a much bigger budget and the advantage of movie editing for the best performances and even when you know how the movie is going to play out and how it will end it still surprises you.<br/><br/>The cast do an amazing job of bringing the characters to life breathing new life into them Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes have great chemistry on screen and really bring the star crossed lovers story of true love to a modern audience also notably John Leguizamo plays Tybalt and really he does a great job at bringing this classic villain to life with a cunning and evil voice and stylish movements worthy of the name prince of cats.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys this classic story of love and loss or just as a romantic love movie."

The biggest problem comes back to the fact that it's modern day, because it isn't relatable to how Romeo and Juliet's lives were like, instead its more like a insulting joke that isn't funny by the way from the bad costumes to Juliet dressed like an angel and Romeo in cheap shining armor to the pathetic performances from otherwise very talented actors even Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was embarrassing to watch. My advice? watch the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet it's a lot better and is a real Shakespearean classic."
"lemoncakess1209","10","1","2","7 May 2013"," Exceeding Expectations
","Baz Luhrmann exceeded Shakespeare's expectations for Romeo and Juliet with this film. For example, the cast of actors chosen to portray the characters were perfect for the job. This is shown best in scenes where Romeo (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is in deep bouts of rage. The emotions expressed by the actors add an extra layer of emotion and depth to the script.<br/><br/>Additionally, the movie style in itself is a twist on the popular play. Although the setting is modern, Luhrmann used the exact linguistics from the original play. It is possible that he chose to do that so the true meaning of the script wouldn't be lost. The contrast of Shakespearean English to a modern setting allows for the audience to better understand the language using the interactions with the characters as a guide.<br/><br/>Even the slight changes Luhrmann made to the original script of the play enhanced the movie. In Act 5 of the play, Juliet was supposed to wake up after Romeo drank the poison; however, in the film Juliet wakes up while Romeo is taking the poison. This action made the scene all the more poignant. Any modifications made for the sake of the film enhanced the emotions and interactions present in the tragedy.<br/><br/>All in all, I give two thumbs up."
"kiyombomununga","7","1","2","7 May 2013"," Did the movie fail to meet Shakespeare's intentions?
","Romeo and Juliet the modern version was quite interesting. Shakespeare wouldn't like Baz Luhrmann version because the setting doesn't fit with his Elizabethan style of writing. He would like it better if the dialogue was more modern to fit the setting. In Romeo and Juliet Shakespeare likes to use a more secretive way of showing love of passion instead of just being intimate unlike Luhrmann's version. In the being of the movie of Luhrmann's version I didn't like it because it was too odd for me and I wish that they would just use modern language to complement each other. Later on in the movie I sort of put that thought to the side because the actions Luhrmann was taking in the movie were very unusual and interesting. Some of the actions in the movie seemed to grab my attention more than the play would. I liked seeing the actors' emotions into each scene and it was very intriguing."
"MissSimonetta","8","1","2","13 March 2013"," Visually bold and very 1990s take on R&J
","I'll admit it: the first time I saw this film in high school I despised it. I found it so ridiculous, so over-the-top that I could barely believe that anyone could take it seriously. I wondered how anyone could think this film was even close to touching the greatness of the 1968 Romeo and Juliet, which is one of the most beautiful films ever made. I'm in college now, and for my Shakespeare on Film class, I had to watch this again. And this time I found myself enjoying it! Not that I still don't have issues with it, but it's much more striking and moving than I remember.<br/><br/>The film's style is very over-the-top. Scenes such as the Capulet and Montague boys at the gas station or Lady Capulet conversing with Juliet about checking out Paris at the ball are played to almost cartoonish extremes. Every image on screen pops with color. The first time I saw the film I found it all garish and much too 1990s, but now I find there's a strange beauty to it. It's as far from the lush Italian setting of the 1968 film as you could get, but it's cool in its own way and there's a ton of motifs, such as the constant use of religious images which contrast with the violent acts committed by the characters. The music is pretty good too, especially ""Kissing You"".<br/><br/>The acting is mostly competent. Claire Danes makes a radiant Juliet, girlish and passionate. Other highlights are Harold Perrineau as Mercutio (the scene where he's performing in drag kills me every time) and Pete Postelthwaite as Friar Laurence. The only actor I had any problem with was our Romeo. Leonardo DiCaprio is handsome and passionate, but the way he delivers a lot of his lines bothers me. His delivery doesn't do the words justice at all.<br/><br/>I still think the 1968 version is the superior film, but I'm glad I saw this again. It's a beautiful film, if only a little-- okay, very over-the-top. But still, it's worth checking out."

It was very gimmicky and it didn't flow right. Second, the acting is pretty bad. Even Leonardo DiCaprio gives a very bland performance. Third, the direction and editing is really frantic and crazy. The beginning you are just wondering what is going on? This is especially bad because you are supposed to take the story seriously but it's so hard to do so because the way how the film is put together is laughably bad. and finally, the pacing is awful! I don't know how many times I checked my watch during the movie to see if it was going to be over soon or not.<br/><br/>The only good thing I can say about this film is the art direction and costume design. It's all very well done but that's nowhere near enough to save this travesty of a film.<br/><br/>Please, even if you are a die hard fan of Leonardo DiCaprio like I am and feel the need to see every single one of his movies, avoid this film at all costs.

It was as off it was a very strange foreign movie that was in English. It also seemed to me to be a parody of Los Angles, mobsters, and foreign movies. This isn't even done in a funny way but a gross and depressing horribly written version of the story of romeo and Juliet. Once you get over the extremely weird setting and general atmosphere/ cloths- the actors were actually really good in a sort of over acted way. The story line is well done but that's probably because it was Shakespeare work and not theirs.

","I remember seeing Romeo + Juliet in a high school English class... or at least I'd like to pretend I did. If anything, I probably remember reading the actual play more, or maybe when they tried to do the comparison with Zeferelli's far superior 1968 version. Bored one day (very bored, though sadly not with the wherewithal to pick up a book like a more sane person), I saw Romeo + Juliet was on cable and stayed tuned to watch it. It's not as bad I've heard from some, which is that it's one of the worst films ever made. It's somehow weirdly watchable in some instances and shots and moments. Baz Lurhmann isn't a hack, that much is completely certain, he's got too much verve and POP in his style to be easily ignored. This is in fact what made Moulin Rouge, for better or worse, the significant achievement it was. But all the technical razzle dazzle in this case can't cover up the biggest problem of all: casting.<br/><br/>And I don't mean that in the sense of ""oh, casting these hot young people of the 90s like Di Caprio and Claire Danes and, uh, John Leguizamo I guess"", that notion is a given. Watching the film today, after years of knowing Romeo & Juliet and Shakespeare work in general, the actors with one or two exceptions can't pull off the performances. Lurhmann leaves these kids and other character players like Harold Pirenneau and even a strange walk-on like Paul Sorvino to fend for themselves. And as for the two stars, Di Caprio and Danes, they are pretty to look at, but the performances clearly don't have a kind of focus that's required with the material. Perhaps this is more than anything not so much a fault of the director's in that ""oh, I'll cast them for this look and that"", but of simple things like rehearsal. I can imagine Lurhmann taking so much time to prepare how to make Verona the Verona-on-speed of his world, the Capulets and Montagues in their power games and battles, all super-designed and made out in super 90s sheek with some 80s leftover.<br/><br/>So in short, there is a vision here, but its squandered when the human elements are left beside. Some bits are worthwhile, like Pete Posthlethwaie (sic) s the priest, but really the main attraction is to try and lure in mall kids who wouldn't go near the Bard with a ten foot pair of designer jeans under normal circumstances. It's shiny and goes fast and crazy, but there's not a lot of substance much... at all. That being said, it's fun to re-live some of the 90s music, as cheesy as it can get."

","I love the way Baz Luhrmann directed this movie. The interesting style that Baz has produced in this film made the film very amusing, especially with the guns instead of swords and daggers. The way this film was made showed a very interesting style that really caught my attention. Although Shakespeare's language is still used in this modernised play, the way the film is directed helps people understand it through the acting and not only the words from the script. Each and every character was a good choice especially John Leguizamo. John is so great at being evil in this movie as Tybalt. I love him!! The way he takes off his jacket, points the gun and smokes his cigar in the beginning of the film is one of the best scenes in the movie."

","Romeo and Juliet was a great play written by William Shakespeare. Many of you could think that modernize a classic is that kind of thing which makes you say: ""oh, no!"". But this isn't the case. The tragedy is perfectly modernized, with a great street spirit which represents perfectly the duel spirit of Shakespeare's time: everyone has a gun, just like a sword in the ancient times; clothing is exaggerate, exactly like in Shakespeare time; and many other things. For the screenplay we can see great images like at the beginning, the duel between Montague and Capulet's men is thrilling also thanks to the screenplay; then we see Romeo in front of the sunset: a very beautiful effect. The soundtrack is full of big names like Cardigans, Radiohead: in particular I appreciated Radiohead's one, perfect for its usage. There are also more ""epic"" songs, in old style, used perfectly in their original form and also remixed to create more suspense. There is no doubt, Romeo+Juliet is an excellent movie, a great modernization, a masterpiece."

Mercutio was portrayed with amazing truthfulness to his real character, as were Paris and Tybalt. I was even impressed with the Nurse's part in the film and I was never a fan of her in the play!! I must say, my favorite character of all was Father Laurence. He's so cliché in the play, the typical priest, however in this film he had true character! Of course, it doesn't hurt that he was played by my ALL TIME FAVORITE actor, Pete Postlethwaite.

","I greatly enjoyed the way Baz Luhrmann brought Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet into a more modern setting. I loved Moulin Rouge, and you can distinctly see Luhrmann's same style coming through in Romeo + Juliet in the filming, the sound effects, and the settings. <br/><br/>The classic tale of the two star-cross'd lovers is set in a present-day Verona, with the Montague/Capulet war spanning the entire city. While the setting is modern, the dialogue is straight from the play, which I think was done wonderfully. But even if Shakespeare seems like a different language to you, you can still understand and enjoy the movie."
"paul2001sw-1","9","1","2","18 August 2004"," It's just that the time was... right!
","For all the Shakespeare's greatness, filming the bard's works presents problems, owing to the static staging, the need for the cast to act unsubtly to convey the meaning of outdated language, and subject matter not obviously attuned to modern life.  The last problem is in fact a mirage, as beneath the surface concerns of his works, Shakespeare addresses universal themes, which is why many have tried to update his plays for modern times: but a straightforward modernisation misses the point that it is the language they contain, rather than their generic and contrived plotting, that makes them great in the first place.  Director Baz Luhrmann therefore tried a different strategy: change the style but keep the words.  So his 'Romeo + Juliet' is set in an apocalyptic hybrid of Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro, and filmed as a cross between 'Dynasty' and a pop video, but retains all the original poetry.  The lurid result is surprisingly fresh, and huge amounts of imaginative fun are had in translation (my favourite details: the depiction of the clans' fathers, one as Ted Kennedy and one as a mafioso; the use of the swimming pool in the famous balcony scenes; and Romeo's exile as a hippy in the desert).  Some of this interpretation is over the top, but there's more hit than miss and even Mercutio (played by Harold Pirreneau as a drag queen) brings real passion to his death. As for the stars, Leonardo di Caprio, an actor of limited range, is well suited to this role, while Claire Danes smiles fluourescently and speaks the centuries-old dialgoue with the saucy naturalness of the contemporary American teenager. The tricksiness fades towards the end as Luhrmann concentrates on the intrinsic drama; but never do you feel like you are watching a play.  In conclusion: Shakespeare still rocks, and Luhrmann does too."

"tom_amity","Null","1","2","15 September 2003"," Somebody finally did ROMEO AND JULIET right!
","The problem with most productions of this play is that they concentrate so much on one aspect---the love-talk between the two principals---that they seriously distort what the tragedy is really about. The play's not just about hearts and flowers, it's also about the senselessness of wars and feuds for the sake of wars and feuds, pride, power-hunger, and the self-perpetuating nature of these evil forces and how they destroy everything good and beautiful that comes in the way. Now THAT'S a tragedy which the 20th and 21st centuries should be able to relate to, and it gives ROMEO AND JULIET a contemporary relevance which this film brought out beautifully.<br/><br/>Far too much is made of the fact that the director gave the play a modern setting. Shakespeare modernized his settings, and there's no reason we can't do the same: Shakespeare gives HAMLET, for example, an Elizabethan setting even though the original Hamlet is supposed to have lived in pre-Viking and pagan times. Modern settings are entirely appropriate to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>I think Danes and DiCaprio are perfectly cast, and I think the Bard would approve. Romeo is suitably impulsive, unintellectual but very plain and honest about his love, just the right combination of punky and sensitive, while Juliet is---well, Juliet. This film has by far the best Tybalt I've ever seen, while Father Laurence all but steals the show. The cast is uniformly fine (except Romeo's sidekick Mercutio wasn't there at all; Zeferelli did much better to make him into an aging stud).<br/><br/>Nothing's perfect. I must admit I don't see the point of moving Juliet's famous balcony scene into a swimming pool, especially since Luhrman's device of the night watchman with his searchlight could have been exploited to great effect. (At the same time, the way Romeo breathes down Juliet's neck as he says ""Wilt thou then leave me so unsatisfied?"", and her wary, just-a-minute,-what's-going-on-here response, ""What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?"", a.k.a. ""Is this for real or are you just horny?"", and the way in which her riposte seems to make him stumble mentally and revise his approach,was one of the film's best moments; I don't think this rather thoughtful touch could have executed by way of the traditional staging). Also, I wish the film hadn't cut the reconciliation between the Hatfield and McCoy patriarchs, with its attendant ""What a lousy waste!"" mood. Oddly, Zefirelli cut those few lines also. Go figure.<br/><br/>No one film can do justice to a Shakespearean tragedy, of course. Buffs should see Zefirelli's film in tandem with this one, just as they should compare and contrast Branagh's and Olivier's HENRY V."
"Angry_Arguer","Null","1","2","16 August 2003"," Almost Watchable
","Romeo+Juliet is what happens when MTV tries to liven up one of Shakespeare's works.  It is better than the toxic waste that Franco Zeffirelli made in 1968, but still suffers in casting and other departments.  I am happy that Kenneth Branagh didn't get involved with this as he is destroying the basis of the plays.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the camera style (and music) are all too reminiscent of a music video and this winds up looking (and sounding) like Michael Bay made this movie.  Ohmigosh, I just hurled the ultimate insult!  I still would really love to see someone like Ridley Scott or Steven Spielberg make an adaptation since they are certainly more intelligent directors.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio was a poor choice for Romeo, I was unable to sympathize with him or the idiots that casted him.  Claire Danes isn't any better with her delivery.  I will say that Pete Postlethwaite (probably the smartest actor on the production) captures my defining image of Father Laurence.  He gets my kudos for the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, a Shakespeare movie that is almost worth your time if you are too braindead to read the plays yourself.  A more thinking person should do the latter.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

Bazz Luhrmann's brave concept is surprisingly good. It doesn't fall in  the mistakes made by most classic stories adapted to the modern age. Di Caprio and Danes are perfect together, the filming and editing is also better than in most movies nowadays. Luhrmann has created a masterpiece. Vote: 9.5 out of 10."

","I saw this movie after I was familiarized with both Titanic and My So-Called Life, both of which I hated powerfully. So naturally I wrote this film off as another horrible modern day translation of a great story. I admit to the world that I was wrong. The movie remained true to the original material and yet packed in enough action to keep me and I'm sure most of the rest of my generation enthralled. You know that this isn't your parent's Romeo when Tybalt goes wild, two gun style with his 9mm Swords. However the acting and story are there also, making it a well rounded movie and not just a bastardization meant to entertain Gen-Xer's whose attention span never exceeds 3 minutes. All in all this one goes down on my list of great films of my generation, so don't be scared away by Leo, this isn't necesarily a ""chick"" or ""date"" movie (though it would be fine to view with your significant other.) I give it my personal thumbs up just because it made me like it despite my bias."

","The only drawback to this ""entertainment vehicle"" of a movie - I don't know how anyone could've hated something so original- was Claire Danes. Other than the fact that, at the time, she probably was cast to attract a young (more female, which would also explain Dicap.) audience, I don't know how she was chosen over countless MUCH BETTER actresses of her agegroup.<br/><br/>I don't understand what the deal is with people saying the dialogue was blurted out without comprehension or understanding from the speakers. I thought it was perfect in this aspect<br/><br/>Many of those who ""hate"" this movie are probably reminded of the more conventional romantic R&J of 1969. I believe though, that there are a few scenes that are actually more romantic in the new version, like the wedding, and in a twisted sort of way, the suicides.<br/><br/>All in all, a GREAT movie to watch: extremely creative, eccentric, great acting (except for Danes), KILLER soundtrack, and on top of that, just happens to derive its screenplay from Mr. William Shakespeare's most tragic love story of all time."
"stills-6","7","1","2","4 June 2000"," Intriguing and clever, but maybe too clever
","I like cross-period staging for Shakespeare - like Ian McKellen's Richard III or Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. It always gives a good perspective on the strength of the underlying story. It can also be said that it gives the director something to do - like a post-WWI staging of Much Ado About Nothing - other than trot out the same costumes as from the last production.<br/><br/>I thought this version was very clever, but maybe more clever than it needed to be. The swimming pool scene (in place of the balcony scene), for example, was an inspired choice. The interaction was much more immediate: standing at a balcony is a scene designed for a stage, not for a movie. But the sense of the scene is also lost. By this time in the movie, the two have already fallen in the deepest love they will ever have (whatever that means - lust is more like it), and the action falls from there. But the play implies much more of a process, instead of proof. The balcony scene is that of two lovers parted by circumstance, both literally and figuratively. The meaning is changed, though subtly, and not necessarily for the better.<br/><br/>I didn't like many of the start-stop and fast-forward camera tricks, not because they are a bad idea in themselves, but because the style negates the scenes they were intended to augment. I especially did not like the faux dramatic echoing noises. There's no need for these tricks. I also found the second half of the movie to be rather tame in terms of technique. Most of the shots after the swimming pool scene are rather bland and ordinary. It was as if the director had used up all of his tricks and couldn't think of any others.<br/><br/>All I can say is thank God that Shakespeare's language was used. Without the language there is no reason for this movie to even be made - it turns the story from a ludicrous mob war to the intriguing version of RJ it is now."

He then rented the Zeffirelli version and rented West Side Story. He then rented a couple of other movies based on other Shakespearean plays. He is now reading Hamlet.<br/><br/>It is so easy to forget that the passions described by Shakespeare are those of teen-agers. It is perhaps equally easy to forget that this is a film adaptation, not the play.<br/><br/>Film has its own rules. The filmmaker has a responsibility not to Shakespeare purists (Orson Welles, Olivier and Kurosawa understood this perfectly) but to the medium and the emotions of the text.<br/><br/>Sure Baz Luhrman's version of this classic play is loud and often obnoxious. Certainly he uses effects that are considered ludicrous outside of a music video (and even then...)-pixilation, freeze frames, undercranking the camera, jump cuts that haven't been around since Jean-Luc Goddard was a young punk...

They deserve credit for memorizing those lines. The movie moves fast and never stalls. Of course we all know how it ends, but we still watch anyway. This one deserves credit and recognition, and the best part about it is the romance-not Leo."
"Tin Man-5","Null","1","2","24 June 1999"," Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. This one didn't.
","Many classic stories and epics have been updated to be set in different time periods than when they were originally intended. Branagh's ""Hamlet"" updated it to the nineteenth century. The 1995 French film ""Les Miserables"" had the classic story set in World War II. Christopher Lambert's ""Beowulf"" was set 2000 years hence in a post-apocalyptic future. Even Frankenheimer's ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" was relocated to present day.<br/><br/>This film seemed to start the trend, however. It's been set in present day Miami, and all in all, it's an excellent and absorbing film. The cast is great--especially Danes, DeCRAPio, and Leguizamo-- and the direction is crisp. The camera work is also dazzling, and it gives the familiar story of the Star-crossed lovers new colors.<br/><br/>But despite the pluses in this film, there is still just something odd about seeing an African-American male in dred locks carrying a gun (with the word ""Sword"" cleverly written on it) and saying, ""Draw forth thou sword!"" I almost wish that they had relocated this film back to the way Shakespeare had intended it-- in the dawn of the Rennaisance. Everything about this film and its camera work and all the odd things about it work fine for Shakespeare, except for the fact it's been relocated. I had to keep reminding myself that this film was set in modern day, because the language told me otherwise. When I first saw it, I was terribly confused because of the cars and the guns and the skyscrapers.... The way they handled it made me feel like I was watching a film taking place in the far past. There could have been some way that the director could have made it more ""modern"" and still keep the classic language. Instead, all the moderations just feel out of place.<br/><br/>This doesn't make it a bad movie, however. It's still mesmerizing. It's definitely a good date film (especially if you're a guy...expect your date to be crying in you shoulder), and it keeps your attention. Give it a try, and just keep in mind that it does take place in present day, even though it makes it really confusing. But that's okay. If you understand half of what they're talking about anyway, you're doing fine.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

Luhrmann and Craig Pearce obviously thought they were being smart by using Shakesperean language in a modern setting, but it comes  off pretentious and unintentionally hilarious. The characters of Mercucio, Tybalt(the surprisingly solid John Leguizamo) and Friar Lawrence(unde- rrated Pete Postlethwaite) are OK, but Paul Sorvino and Brian Dennehy are wasted, and most of the dialogue is shouted (particularly the opening scene) making much of it incoherent when not downright stupid.

","The main problems with this movie is the directors style, which is generally a cringe worthy mix of something you would expect to find on MTV combined with a YouTube video where the editor had just discovered all of the effects. Just in the beginning scene alone, there's a scary number of consistent annoying zooms into close ups and the scene consistently interchanging between normal and slow motion. Instead of helping to progress the story, as any good film should, it instead gets in the way of the story, feeling as if the director was more worried about showing of his previously mentioned style and trying to be noticed instead of creating a good film adaptation of Shakespeare's work.<br/><br/>The film then plummets to an even more more intolerable level as it reaches its first talking scene. Not only does the pacing of the film majorly slow but you realise that all the dialogue is written in old English. This makes some of the performances seem very flat because it is as if the actors don't actually know what they are talking about. <br/><br/>Overall, this film isn't worried about its story but instead, it is constantly distracting you from it with the director trying to say ""Look at me and my style"". This makes the film very hard to sit through due to its cringe worthy style, weak performances and uneven pacing."

No surprise that it got decent treatment by movie critics, it has plenty of men singing and dancing around in drag in the party scene, which looked more like your typical San Francisco party than anything else. The movie critics just eat that up with a spoon, all the while calling it avant-garde. Do yourself a favor and just re-read the book, or watch the 1968 adaptation if you want to see a movie.

The actors, with the exception of Claire Danes, the only one not over acting, were poorly chosen and the car chase scene at the beginning made the ancient grudge displayed in the original ply look more like a down town drug feud. In my opinion, the single worst film of Leonardo Decaprio's career and I would advise people wanting to see this movie to watch something that actually gets it's meaning across without meaningless violence and anyone who says meaningless crap like 'OMG this is a masterpiece' and 'Baz Lureman - the only man in Hollywood who understands Shakespeare' to wear a blind fold and walk through a bus interchange on a week day at 3:00 and/ or get a bloody life!"

","The film is based on one of William Shakespeare's plays about two rival families and one from each family falling in love and their relationship basically causes controversy between the groups. Baz Luhrmann's film is a basic modern version of the Shakespearean play, but the film itself does not work. Luhrmann uses modern clothes and weapons etc, but he has kept the Shakespearean dialogue. The dialogue and the modern elements do not mix together well. The acting is dreadful and immature and the fight scenes are badly choreographed.

Not once did I ever get the feeling that his cast even understood the old English much less hold a passion for the story or the characters. Even the more mature actors like Sorvino and Dennehy, both of whom I respect deeply, seemed a bit stilted in the delivery of most of their few lines. Anyone who truly knows the meaning of 'wherefore', will absolutely dislike most of the individual performances in this enactment. If you really want to enjoy this story, give up on DiCaprio and Danes and go with Whiting and Hussey in the 1968 Franco Zefferelli version. If you've already tried to give this one a fair shake, watch the other one and really feel the passion!<br/><br/>I'd just like to add, Romeo and Juliet was brought into the 20th century in 1961. It didn't use ""olde englishe"" but it did use music. It was directed by Robert Wise (yes he has also directed Star Trek stuff) and Jerome Robbins. This version won 10 Oscars, including Best Picture.

Another credit is that it might actually get kids vaguely interested in Shakespeare (or may not), as at least I have found I can recite some parts of it word for word. Probably the only problems were the title (Romeo and Juliet would have been cool, ""Romeo + Juliet"" sounds really tacky) and some of the slightly strange editing at times.

From that aspect, I can respect the creators. But, unfortunately it wasn't what it was suppose to be.

This should have not been changed, it is far too big symbolically.<br/><br/>I also want to mention the music. The music is excellent! It fits the scenes, and is a nice mix of popular music and classical style. One of the reasons why I can forgive some of the annoyances.<br/><br/>It is one my favorite movies, even with my complaints."

","I find it incredible how people today cannot appreciate the beauty of speech. In Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet, using Spakespeare's original text help the EDUCATED viewer understand the deep sub-text. Perhaps a person who has not studied Shakespeare will not understand that using a modern day situation, with Shakespeare's text, teaches the audience on cruel fate and how it can affect anyone.<br/><br/>Allowing stereotypes to fill the persona of Montague and Capulet helps conceive the viewing of one true love and destiny. Two groups, so different can still hold and give forth love for each other.

","When this version of R&J was in the cinema here in the Netherlands, I went to see it. Now only two days ago, April 27, 2005, I went to the store and bought the DVD because I enjoyed Shakespeare in Love (with Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Colin Firth) and wanted to see the original (text) of R&J again. I didn't quite remember what this specific movie was like, but when I started to see it, it was a huge disappointment for me.<br/><br/>Although it might be a good idea to set the play in modern time, it is the way it was translated in todays world which quite offended me. I quit looking when Mercutio arrived to the Bal Masque of the Capulets. <br/><br/>In my humble opinion, this version of the tragic and lamentable story of Romeo and Juliet, makes it vulgar and dirty. Perhaps I only saw the baddest part (licking the nipple of Benvolio (I think) and the outfit and acting of Mercutio) but it was enough for me to simply shut of the computer and return the DVD to the store."

","Had to post this. I've kept reading (since MOULIN ROUGE was released) what a genius Baz Luhrmann is, but I have to say I was disappointed with this. Maybe it's possible to set Shakespeare in the present day, but on this evidence, it just doesn't work. I watched the film on a rented DVD. I don't know the play well, and on occasions lost track of what was happening, so I tried to follow the text in my Complete Works of Shakespeare. It seemed to me that there were lots of passages of INVENTED Shakespearean verse - or did I just imagine this? Apart from the failure to convey the emotion that's vital to this story, there were examples throughout where the modern setting made nonsense of the story. At the crux of it all, I couldn't help asking myself why Pete Postlethwaite didn't tell Claire Danes ""Now shallst thou to thy mobile phone ... Go and inform thy Romeo of our deed""! thus averting the tragedy and saving us from a truly feeble rendition of the climax. To me, the Zeffirelli version was better on every level."

","Movies like ""Moulin Rouge!"" (or more recently, ""La La Land"") are so lavishly designed and stylishly directed that the simplicity of their stories is no coincidence, they are well-crafted forms of entertainment meant to arouse emotions rather than thoughts.<br/><br/>Indeed, while I'm not a professional on editing or filmmaking, what I gathered from years of cinematic dedication is that complex, multi-layered, character-driven stories generally call for straightforward directing, so that the form doesn't distract from the content. In other words, there's a time for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and another for ""Chinatown"", and I can't think of a good movie that is both exceedingly directed and written (with the exception of ""Citizen Kane"").<br/><br/>Can we take for granted that people know ""Romeo and Juliet"" so well that a few artistic licenses won't hurt, or are actually needed? Is it such an iconic story that it can sustain every narrative form without undermining the emotional bingo of the end? Well, I'm not sure the story is self-sufficient, while watching Leo as Romeo (talk about predestination in that rhyming) challenging Tybalt (John Leguizamo), shouting Shakespeare's lines with such passion I could hardly understood what he said, I was wondering if the movie wouldn't have worked as well or better had they been swords instead of guns, Verona instead of Verona Beach and good old Renaissance as the time setting.<br/><br/>And it's precisely because Leonardo Di Caprio was an excellent Romeo, in his pre-""Titanic"" fame years with the youthful charm, the wide-eyed innocence, the eyebrow-raising enthusiasm and penetrating sadness, he was a baby-faced young man who could easily pass as a teenager. The rest of the casting was competent, honorable mention to Leguizamo who looked as passionately angry as his 1968 counterpart Michael York, and to Paul Sorvino and Pete Postlewhaite. Claire Danes paled in comparison but not to the point of ruining the film. What did spoil the film a little was actually its own reason to be, Baz Lhurmann!"" thought that Shakespeare's romance needed a rejuvenation treatment, as if it wasn't modern enough for younger audiences.<br/><br/>The problem is that the story has been modernized already, like Kurosawa made adaptations of ""Macbeth"" and ""King Lear"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" inspired good movies like ""West Side Story"" or ""China Girl"", love stories with a gang war as the backdrop. In fact any interesting romance inevitably revolves around star-crossed lovers, any romance owes a bit to ""Romeo and Juliet"" which owed to all the romantic heritage of the past centuries. So you either remake ""Romeo and Juliet"" or you adapt it, there is rarely an in-between solution. Lurhmann took the challenge and it's laudable, but his ""Romeo + Juliet"" couldn't be a total remake or it would have been a second ""West Side Story"", it was doomed to be half-Shakespeare, half-something else.<br/><br/>And the problem is that the text didn't match the setting, no matter how hard it tried like replacing the narrator by a TV announcer. It was so busy reminding you that this is the Shakespeare play in its academic version (same lines) that it became unchained to its premise, while in any of the previous adaptations; the romance was the focal point, not its kinship with the original story. It came to the point that the 'Trainspotting'-like editing, the pop music, the opera, the shootouts, the awkward mix between modern settings and Renaissance-expressions becomes a sort of gimmick that overshadowed the story. The form detracted from the story, and the heart of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the story. If you're not emotionally involved, it's over.<br/><br/>And the film could still win the audiences, had it not ruined the very scenes that could create the emotional involvement, through some bizarre experimentation. I didn't care for the 1968 version until the balcony scene; Olivia Hussey's youthful beauty, the purity of Nino Rota's score, the interactions between the young lovers, the film won because of that scene. So, I expected the balcony scene to enhance ""Romeo + Julier"" but Lurhmann had to introduce the novelty of the swimming pool. What was he thinking? If you're going to stick to the play, don't ruin the most iconic part. How can someone be focused on loving while he's also trying to float in the water. Forget what I said, the whole thing just looked awkward and as sincere as the actors were in their intent to play ""Romeo and Juliet"", it's like Lurhmann had another movie in mind.<br/><br/>The film was a success but it was out-shined by the Leo's following hit, the one that put him in Hollywood map forever and ever; ""Titanic"" the year after, interestingly, this was a tale of forbidden love that was closer in spirit and in heart to ""Romeo and Juliet"" than ""Lurrhman's jukebox. And Claire Danes, with all due respect, is no Kate Winslet. Leo is a real romantic actor but the real star of Baz Lurhmann's film was Baz Lurhmann. His unique jukebox-styled directing fitted ""Moulin Rouge!"" but as far as ""Romeo + Juliet"" goes, it's still an entertaining little movie, that nostalgic of the 90's will cherish. For me, it's the film of that ""Love Fool"" song and I have it on my playlist."

Hell, if it weren't for 10th grade English class, who knows if I'd ever try my luck at Shakespeare? He's not the most accessible author around.<br/><br/>But the execution is way off. Warring families are updated to street gangs and swords are branded as guns (literally), but the dialogue is strictly Elizabethan era. Those words and the contemporary setting do not mix. At all. It's especially jarring in the opening scenes with the spazzed-out gangbangers.

I thought that in the beginning of the movie, there was a lot going on and that the movie would be hard to follow.

Some may find it funny but I don't. I would have preferred only certain parts to have the original writing. Although that is my opinion, I understand why it is written the way it is. If William Shakespeare wrote a book instead of a play, the movie would have modern day words, but it was written as a play, so it is spoken the way the play would have been. I would recommend you see this movie. I would also read the play and watch a different version of the movie. I feel like if you do that you get to see what you think things would look like, and what people interpreted everything to look like. I also feel that if you only read the play and watch one version you have nothing to compare to and some people may prefer another version over the other.

","We're watching this movie in my English class, and to put it lightly, it's pretty horrendous. The idea itself of adapting one of Shakespeare's works is astounding and takes great talent and care, but if done poorly, the results end just like the play- tragic.<br/><br/>My first issue is the fact that the characters are speaking in Elizabethan English, which completely boggles my mind. Not only does it make the whole thing utterly confusing and unrealistic, it also heavily damages the point of modernizing the play at all. Another thing that bothered me about the play was how Luhrmann seemed so eager to cleverly adapt the play that he pretty much tried to throw in every ""modern"" thing he could think of- fast cars, gunfights, drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, obnoxious parties, loud punk music and street violence; all taking place in a rundown, scummy tourist attraction by the beach. He pretty much included everything but the kitchen sink, which not only makes the movie cliché, but it also ruins any chance of the movie to be seen as ""edgy"" instead of ridiculous.<br/><br/>Asides from that, there's not much else, besides actors who either don't fit their part or can barely speak their lines. Often both. DiCaprio might be in this movie, but that doesn't make it any better, especially with his co-star, whose acting was about was vibrant as a dishcloth. Way too many transition effects in the movie, which make it extremely hard to watch the screen without getting a migraine. The only thing I enjoyed was the beautiful backdrops of the Capulet home, especially by the poolside. I also enjoyed Mercutio and his antics, and that was pretty much the only thing I found entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall, watch the 1968 version instead and don't waste your time!"

This is a terribly overrated movie that certainly doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. The movie feels like a huge jumbled mess with horrible editing, and some pretty dreadful performances. It seemed more like a satire of Shakespeare then a modernization.<br/><br/>First comes the performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is very bland at best. Even in the love scenes with Juliet, he had about as much personality as a piece of wood. Claire Danes was fine as Juliet. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. John Leguizamo was dreadful as Tybalt. He had a terrible case of overacting that made me cringe at his performance. Harold Perrineau's performance as Mercutio was (much like Leguizamo's) plagued with another case of overacting. The only actor who seemed to do very well in his role was Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Laurence. He had the calm, mellow attitude that was accurate for a modern version of the character. As for the supporting cast, none of them really stood out and even if they did it wasn't for anything good at all.<br/><br/>As for the production elements, it was very lack luster. The editing closely resembled that of Luhrmann's future film, Moulin Rouge. This means the editing was sloppy and quick, not allowing us to see some of the visuals created for the film. Everything else about the movie was just so forgettable: the music, the costumes, EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>So overall, this movie really didn't do it for me.

","This is an incredible adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. It's wild and unconventional and ridiculous, and that's what makes it so good. The director, Baz Luhrmann, knows that he's going out of the realm of what most people would consider to be a great screen adaptation of this play, and he uses that to its full advantage. This isn't just Shakespeare for a Shakespeare-reading audience, it's easily accessible and enjoyable whether or not you've read the play or can understand the full meaning behind each line. The direction and scenery is raw and unpretentious; the modern setting means it doesn't distract you with elaborate costumes or historical accuracies, just lets the pure emotion of the story come through. It really brings across the point that this type of story resonates through every time period and every generation, and can mean just as much to a modern audience as it did in Shakespeare's time. <br/><br/>The performances in this movie are incredible, much more so than in any other version of this play, stage or screen, that I've ever seen. Harold Perrineau plays infamous entertainer Mercutio with both dramatic flair and emotional intensity, and brings the character to life in a way that I believe Shakespeare himself would have appreciated (whether or not he would agree with the fact that he was dressed as a drag queen at a point in the movie), and John Leguizamo's Tybalt is appropriately fiery and sneering while bringing an interesting humanity to this typically villainous character. <br/><br/>The leads also turn out stunning performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were perfectly casted as these star-crossed lovers, and they embody their youth and naiveté in a way that, for the teenage audience watching this film, makes it feel fresh and personal. They speak Shakespearan dialogue with a raw, unpracticed ease, bringing to mind the way that these young lovers would have really spoken. Leo's Romeo is every bit as perfectly over-the- top and romantic as one might expect, and he handles both sweet, intense and tragic scenes with a realness that tears at your heart. Claire's Juliet has that same quality, and she lends even iconic lines (""Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"") a new twist. <br/><br/>All in all, don't judge this movie by its cover. A modern version of Romeo + Juliet featuring gunfights and costume parties might not be for everyone, but it stays so true to the genuine, relatable themes of the play that the backdrop can't possibly impair your enjoyment."

Guns, gas and gross misconduct may be as violent and as the famous playwright intended and to implement his words into this modern telling is a startling contrast and personally, I believe this is such an important technique to making this film so exciting and universally unique.<br/><br/>What the director has done is comprehend modern trends. He followed the trend of current cinema so that we could all appreciate the context and by taking the words of Shakespeare has made it easier to comprehend, a startling technique that has been such a beneficiary to school exams and also for pure viewing pleasure. Whilst it has been many years since I have read the play and studied it for my G.C.S.E's I recall watching and being baffled and now more years on I can still appreciate how powerful and how spoken this picture is.<br/><br/>The work that has been achieved here is spoken through its various stars with Leonardo Di Caprio made a sex symbol and Claire Danes going on with more romantic roles. Their first meeting in the film through a fish tank is beautifully choreographed, a section that doesn't feel too cheesy thanks to the calm playing of the song 'Kissing You'.<br/><br/>The love at first sight ideology has been worked to death in modern cinema in romantic comedy dramas and here it is tackled as in Shakespeare's mind, as pure and as lust that is crossed with startling rivalry.<br/><br/>The film boasts a courageous soundtrack revelling in gorgeous settings that do justice to a story so strong, and yet so dark. This is a great film, taking a tragic story and turning into a modern telling of love repression and violence."

The actors simply show passion in a great way and develop a personality that you can identify with which increases the enjoyment significantly. The props, setting and environment completely do the film justice. I absolutely love the fact the film still uses the original dialogue this is what makes the film so unique.

","So, a classic play with a modern setting? Can it be done? No. If Baz is the director? Yes! This movie could not have been made by anyone else. Claire Danes (beautiful angel costume, compliments to Catherine Martin) shines as Juliet. She isn't the traditional Juliet that the play was originally sexist towards her character. She's got emotion and adds more into Juliet than no one ever did. When Juliet committed suicide, that facial expression into the camera was so strong and memerorizing, as is the film. I cried like a baby whilst watching it. Leonardo Di Caprio is perfect as Romeo, being a today teenager and an Elizabethen teenager at the same time. With an amazing kissing scene, Romeo+ Juliet wins in originality. It's well acted, and the deaths are done really well and the suicide scene defines love and the true meaning of it."

","Is Baz Luhrmann a master artist? Perhaps so. After his flamboyant, colourful and often riotous debut with ""Strictly Ballroom"", which dazzled many audiences and captured the heart of Australian humour, many would have said yes. Now it seems that goes double after his latest creation, especially for this film lover.<br/><br/>I must say ""Strictly Ballroom"" did not exactly floor me when I saw it first, my expectations being higher than my appreciation. In hindsight though I can see what a clever stroke of originality it was. This time Luhrmann has boldly remade ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"", and again my expectations were high. Yet this time they were completely fulfilled.<br/><br/>Mr. Luhrmann has fashioned an incredible piece of cinema, modernising the old bard's famous tragedy and proving that it is truly timeless. His flamboyance and flair again shows, and early on in the film our director almost over indulges with his little extravagances. Then again the opening scenes do rather set the mood for what is a fantastic eye-fest of colour and light as we are treated to superlative sets, incredible art direction and magnificent costumes form Kym Barrett. In fact it is ingenious that the poetry of the visual goes hand in hand with the original, virtually unaltered text. of the heart rending play.<br/><br/>Renowned editor Jill Bilcock (""Evil Angels"") does a marvellous job, as does cinematographer Donald McAlpine, brilliantly capturing some stunning, innovative shots of Luhrmann's gorgeous action. This is pure art, infinitely watchable.<br/><br/>Finally there is the cast, who can make or break a movie in which acting is of paramount import. And they make it! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal Romeo, and his dramatic scenes are truly convincing and very strong, making us believe all his anguish and sorrow. Fabulous too is pretty Juliet, the thoroughly charming and captivating Claire Danes who has no trouble making us believe that she would surely die for her beloved Romeo. The support is tops too, with John Leguizamo especially sinister as Tybalt, Juliet's cousin and ""Prince of Cats"". Romeo's good friend Mercutio is played well by Harold Perrineau, with Jesse Bradford as Balthasar (Romeo's aide) and Paul Rudd as the dashing Paris who would woo Juliet if she would have him. Miriam Margoyles is most enjoyable as young Juliet's nurse-maid, as is Pete Postlethwaite as the priest who tries so desperately to help the star-crossed lovers. The heads of each household, played by Brian Dennehy and Christina Pickles (as the Montagues) and Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora (Capulets), have little to do, but they do impress in the few scenes they have.<br/><br/>Please go and see this at the cinema.........................now!<br/><br/>Wednesday, February 12, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema<br/><br/>Luhrmann's elaborate, colourful, in your face interpretation of Shakespeare's timeless tragedy was bold to say the least. But it comes off! All the visual splendour loses a lot in the transition to the small screen, but as a piece of entertainment it is still quite a work.<br/><br/>All technical credits, including cinematography, editing, set design and costumes, are outstanding, and the vibrant pop soundtrack adds aural colour. Acting is the film's strongest suit with DiCaprio and Danes leading the way, both giving emotionally strong showings. The support cast also deliver with special mention to John Leguizamo as the obsessive Tybalt and Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Lawrence.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend a trip to the cinema for this or any Baz Luhrmann flick.<br/><br/>Saturday, December 27, 1997 - Video"

","Just recently, I saw the 1968 version of Shakespeare's classic. And I hated it. Therefore, I was convinced that this adaptation would be no better. However, I heard nice things about it, and decided to rent it.<br/><br/>Well. I was pleasantly surprised. What emotions I lacked while viewing the older one, or even reading the play, I felt while watching this movie. I think it takes a lot to make Shakespeare feel relevant to a modern teen, but Baz Luhrman managed to do this.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. I love Claire Danes, and it was nice to see what she is capable of. Of course, I already know that Leo can act. And the twist on the ending was brilliant. Throughout the last twenty minutes or so, I found myself hoping against hope that maybe this could have a happy ending. Of course, we all know how it ends, and happy is one thing it isn't.<br/><br/>I do have some complaints, though. Parts of this movie were just...well, weird. Don't get me started on Mercutio. But if you can handle the edgy strangeness, you should definitely watch this movie."

","You would be forgiven for expecting this film to be just a love story best suited to the more feminine viewer. Of course the star crossed lovers story is here but there is enough pace and testosterone to entertain those who want action too.<br/><br/>Set in the modern day the swords are guns and the horses, cars but this only adds to an appreciation of the drama of this timeless story. The adaptations of the original play are both creative and witty. Shakespearian language is still used but don't let that put you off, you quickly get used to it.<br/><br/>The acting is without fault, particularly for the lead roles. At times it even feels a little uncomfortable to be witnessing such powerful emotions.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stylish and dazzling; many scenes are truly unforgettable just for the photography. I think that Donald M. McAlpine adopts a similar vivid approach he did later for Moulin Rouge but I found this to be less flamboyant.<br/><br/>The sound track complements the visual feast. The music is varied and powerful- adding to the pace and texture of the storyline.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann is worthy of huge acclaim in that he directed and produced this great film and also wrote the screenplay with Craig Pearce.<br/><br/>I write this comment in 2007 and my appreciation of this classic is no less now then as when I saw it first 9 years ago. 10/10."

","Romeo And Juliet has been examined and appraised for over 400 years, and I have nothing to add to all that discussion. But I do know the play is such a monument that anyone bringing it to stage or screen will either do it justice or screw it up.<br/><br/>So, what of Baz Luhrmann's rendition? All I can say is it's wonderful. Just, wonderful.<br/><br/>Like any film it has its flaws, but so what? The 'modern' look and sound will please some and annoy others (I didn't like it much); but in a hundred years nobody will care for or against that.<br/><br/>This film should be remembered for two scenes: the birth of the love between Romeo and Juliet, and their unhappy end. Forget all the melodrama in-between, good bad or indifferent. The only thing that counts is that both those scenes are done well enough to give the other one its meaning and emotional impact.<br/><br/>I can't speak for anyone else of course but, for myself, I have never seen those two scenes done so convincingly as they are in this film.

"je_taimealafolie","8","0","1","22 July 2007"," Indefinite Love
","""I Love Thee."" Love, Amor, Aroha. Love, love, love, love, love. What is this so called love? Baz Luhrman's version of Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet' can answer that question for you. Bursting with many different loves from arranged love to forbidden love, forbidden to doomed love, to name a few, and portrayed in such fine detail along with its amazing cast such as Leonardo Dicaprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet who both play the love scenes with immense passion and ease, giving its audience a taste of what true love really is. This is truly ""A film that will kick you in the heart.<br/><br/>This is a powerful story of chaos, fate and above all, love. Set in a modernized Verona, where daggers, rapiers and swords are used as brand names for guns. A place where you will see guys dressed in Hawaiian shirts, cars with speed and police men with a modern look, who and which are all surprisingly relevant to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet script. But most importantly, it is a story of two young star-crossed lovers who meet at a party and fall deeply in love, but then find out that they belong to families who have been enemies for a period of time. This love the two lovers, Romeo and Juliet have, is then kept a secret which becomes more and more difficult to hold on to leading to the most brutal things.<br/><br/>From the scene with the aquarium where Romeo and Juliet first encounter each other to the 'blue' and tragic ending, the love stayed alive and stole my heart. The love in this updated movie was way to powerful to keep anybody's tear drops in place and it definitely was worth the sniffs and the subterfuge of hiding behind the sentence ""I just finished yawning."" An idea in the movie relevant to love, that I LOVED, was the use of water. I see the water is Romeo and Juliet's love world, Romeo and Juliet first meet at a fish tank where they start flirt, Romeo and Juliet fall in pool and start kissing etc. But I also see the water as dangerous in some way, Tybalt dies in water, families drenched in rain, which shows and tells me that you shouldn't get involved with Romeo and Juliet and their love, or you will pay.<br/><br/>This film truly is an amazing movie and I could just see all the time, effort and hard work that was put into making this just by watching it. If five stars meant ""Very Very Good"", then the eight stars I give this movie would just show how much love I have for it. ""Did my heart love 'till now?"" (Romantic movies that is), why yes, yes it did, thanks to this version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. The strongest love story ever told."

Claire Danes as a Juliet is perfrectly casted and makes her seem like a role model to many little girls. she may not be a very good role model what with being in a tragedy and all but its still worth it. Romeo and Juliet is a tearful movie that fits the wishes of being a Chick-flick through and through. the soundtrack on this movie is brilliant to all the changes that comes through. the perfectly shown differences between the Montague's and Capulet's. a 9out of 10 movie and i want to see it again"
"chrisvoffshore","9","0","1","6 June 2007"," Bravo!
","Nowadays there is much criticism of lemming movie makers that follow the herd.<br/><br/>Well, here is an example of fresh, original movie-making that takes perhaps the most famous love story of all and gives it a unique treatment. Good on you, Mr. Luhrmann!<br/><br/>I'd like to take issue with those that excoriated this film - did you not know before you bought your ticket you were going to watch Romeo and Juliet set in a modern-day California with guns and stuff? If you didn't, that's too bad. It's like going on a roller-coaster and then complaining you got the heevy-jeevys. What did you expect, I ask you with tears in my cotton pickin' eyes? And it's not as though the brave, original Mr. Lurhmann butchered Shakespeare's text - he didn't. Sure, he edited it where he felt he needed to, and changed the ending (which I disagreed with) but every word you hear was written by the Bard himself - hence the title W.S.'s R&J.<br/><br/>Enough people enjoyed this movie to warrant its worthy place in the canon of Shakespeare on Film - and those (purists) that didn't should have know beforehand that it would not be their cup of tea. That's why we have the wonderful, definitive Zefferelli R&J - which this movie sure didn't attempt to compete with.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought this movie was a blast. That newscast opening scene (prologue) was wonderful. I rubbed my hands in imaginary glee when I saw it, because I knew I was in for a treat - and sure was. Let's not all take Shakespeare so seriously, just because he has this lofty place in our culture."
"cezal198","6","0","1","12 May 2007"," I wouldn't say that it was the best representation of Shakespeare ever made, but at least it made 16th century English literature cool again.
","The 1996 film, Romeo + Juliet was quite over the top in many cases. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle puts it well when he says, ""its so overloud and overdirected, and overproduced and so energetic that finally, you can't do anything except smile at it."" The concept is simple, a modern day Romeo and Juliet located in Verona Beach (a fictional place very similar to Miami beach), situated between two warring mob families, but the catch is that every spoken word is directly quoted from Shakespeare. Apparently, the directorial decision on how to fulfill the task of verbatim delivery in a modern setting was to make the visuals, the acting, and tempo of the film extremely eccentric. There is no other way to describe it other than: bright colors, flashing attire, ""in your face"" production design, with overly exaggerated acting in a land, where guns are swords, families are gangs, and paraphrasing is not an option. <br/><br/>In most cases in modern film, melodramatic acting is looked down upon, but when quoting Shakespeare, it becomes excusable. Though it seems out of place when a goon flashing a 9mm gun exchanges witty remarks with a cross dresser, it somehow fits into the style of this movie. That is why I think it was a good decision to make the film so over the top. The lines of Shakespeare coming out of anyone's mouth just adds to the overall pageantry of the film. The actor's delivery could have been better, but it is very difficult to act modern, hip, and cool, and at the same time deliver archaic lines of Shakespeare, especially when they are some of the most quoted and overused lines in history. One thing that I felt was very well done, which I think was intended, was making Shakespearian writing very understandable to their target audience whom I assume are not scholars of English literature. The visuals and the overemphatic acting are so self-proclamatory that you could probably watch the movie in a different language and still easily understand what was going on. Almost everything spoken is shown, and if its not then you just have to be smart enough to catch it.<br/><br/>One thing about the film that is very hard not to notice is the use of religious icons and imagery littered throughout the film. When I say littered, I mean literally littered: postcards of Mary scattered along the streets and different forms of shrines of Mary and crosses exalted in every household and even police stations. There is such an excess of pious imagery in every situation that it's almost iconoclastic. Romeo and Juliet consecrate their marriage in front of a shrine of the Virgin. Neon blue lighted crosses line the pathway to Juliet's tomb. Statuettes of Mary are seen in the same shots as the cross-dressing Mercutio (did I mention he's a cross dresser in this movie?) parties at the Capulet house. It seems very odd and discomforting to visually mix sexuality and religious icons. I am not sure if the director was just doing this to be cool, or he was making some kind of statement dealing with religion and love. It seemed slightly emphasized when Juliet calls Romeo her God whom she worships. I wonder if the interpretation of Shakespeare was taken to an extreme regarding the love and passion of two human beings. Does it override religion in this film? In the play, Shakespeare obviously followed along with the standard of marriage before sex, and the film also respected that moral statute, but sex in front of the Virgin? What are they trying to say? One can only guess. <br/><br/>Romeo + Juliet was a unique and enjoyable experience, and that is about it. I felt like the challenge of the film, being the use of literal Shakespeare, was so pronounced and sought after, that it didn't get much past that. It was an interesting experiment and a bold move from a filmmaker's standpoint. They accomplished what they wanted to achieve, and I applaud them for it. I wouldn't say that it was the best representation of Shakespeare ever made, but at least it made 16th century English literature cool again."

But when I continue watching it, it actually gets better and better, but not by a whole lot.<br/><br/>First, I probably like this film because of the modern update. I didn't like the play that Shakespeare wrote but this one actually manages the descents for me to recommend it. This film is loud, exaggerated, and bombastic! At first, those were meant to be bad things in the movie but as it progresses, I liked it.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is much better in this film than the original (by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes).

","I'll admit that I avoided seeing this movie in the theater because it was modernized. When the movie appeared on the premium movie channels, I watched the first 10 minutes and switched channels, turned off by the guns and the ""too modern"" aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Then, the next time I saw it on the movie channels, I'd watch a little bit more. Pretty soon I had watched the whole thing, and I came to appreciate it the ways the director had attempted to stay true to Shakespeare while making it more accessible to today's generation.<br/><br/>Leonardo seems like an okay choice, although he brings a wimp factor to Romeo's character. Then again, wasn't Romeo kind of a whipped puppy? Although I appreciate the adherence to the original language, sometimes having Romeo speak it with little or no emotion (or what seemed like the way a high school actor would read the lines) lessened the efficacy of the scene. Claire Danes is quite gifted, in my opinion, and I think she played the part well. When she pulls a gun on Friar Laurence and screams, ""Be not long to speak -- I long to die!"", we can feel her anguish. Sometimes she, like Leonardo, would read her lines with little or no emotion, and it cheapened the scene. THen again, this may have been the inevitable of effect of trying to read Shakespeare's lines in a n ""everyday"" situation. There's no crying, no anger, no anything ... therefore, how would you read the lines? Mercutio was brilliantly cast, for this actor seems to reveal the outlandish nature of the Mercutio's character.<br/><br/>I like the small details that the director put in there to refer to the original script or to show the division between the two families. The two buildings named after the families, the difference in dress and appearance, and the billboards around town -- the film is full of subtle (and not-so-subtle) allusions. I loved how they named the guns as to stay true to the original text.<br/><br/>The director heightened the death scene by having Juliet wake up and touch Romeo's cheek just after he downed the poison, rather than waking up seconds after he died. Same scene, just a minor time difference here.<br/><br/>The only thing I greatly disliked about the movie was how the party was turned into drug-fueled chaos. Was that necessary? Couldn't there have been a huge party without Juliet's mom sucking face with every available male, and Romeo acting loopy from whatever pill Mercutio had given him earlier? I show this movie to my high school students to provide a modernized view of the play. I can say that my students seem to ""get"" this version. The 1968 version? Not so much."

I saw this movie after I had become a Bard nut, and i thought it to be the most wonderful thing I had ever dreamed of being done with his words. The acting is not to be faulted, and while some complain that the leads did not know the meaning of their lines, I thought the performances by DiCaprio and Danes to be fresh and exciting, and especially well thought out. Watch out for Mercutio and Tybalt, they are the best performances I have ever seen of those characters. This movie is by far superior in my eyes to the 1968 version, in which all performances, save Michaael York, made me want to chop my head off with a blunt ax.

","During the first half of this movie I was MAD. I seriously thought it was a joke at first- the whole fight scene in the beginning was weird. I couldn't accept all these thugs with guns spouting Shakespeare; I didn't find it believable at all. They took a line, ""thy drugs are quick"" completely out of context, and used it when Romeo gets high at the Capulet's party, which made me really angry. I didn't like what was done with the characters of Benvolio and Mercutio, and Claire Danes didn't always sell her role of Juliet very convincingly. The whole balcony scene where they're jumping into a pool in her backyard was kind of strange.<br/><br/>It did have some nice moments, though. The scene where Romeo and Juliet meet was very cute, and the wedding scene was sweet as well. After Act 3, where Romeo kills Tybalt, it got better. The fall out after the murder was fast-paced and interesting. I was really impressed with the last scenes in the church; they were breathtaking and beautifully shot.<br/><br/>Even though it redeemed itself in the end, most of it still didn't sit right with me. Too much of it felt like it didn't just fit. Maybe it was that it tried too hard to fit into the 90's atmosphere, or maybe Shakespeare just can't be modernized. Overall, I preferred the classic Romeo and Juliet to this interpretation."

Whereas the likes of O and 10 Things I Hate About You are updated in both style/look and dialogue, the fact is this made them seem less relevant and watered-down.<br/><br/>Keeping the dialogue in Romeo + Juliet means that you focus on what is said AND THE EXPRESSIONS and keeps the story powerful whilst updating the setting to modern-day Verona Beach (gangs, guns and narcotic-induced partying) make it feel real. An excellent movie with one of the best intros I've ever seen (nice little news cast and introduction of the gang fighting/rivalry).<br/><br/>(Pity about Moulin Rouge though!!!) If you haven't seen Romeo + Juliet - WATCH IT!"

","I first saw bits of this and dismissed it because back then I hated Leonardo DiCaprio and Shakespearean language in the modern world, but now I like both. BAFTA winning director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) has brought the famous William Shakespeare love story into the 20th century (not the language of course), e.g. daggers are guns called Dagger. Romeo (DiCaprio) and Juliet (Terminator 3's Claire Danes) are two strong lovers, but they cannot be together as their families are in a battle with each other. The story is no change from the original play story, and in fact, it is almost like a stage performance (particularly with characters not ""looking behind them""). A lovely and tragic film with a doomed romance. Also starring John Leguizamo as Tybalt, Lost's Harold Perrineau as Mercutio, Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague, Friends' Paul Rudd as Dave Paris, Miriam Margolyes as The Nurse and Des'ree is in the film singing the film's love song, ""Kissing You"". It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, it won the BAFTAs for Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Nellee Hooper, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound. Very good!"

","A little while ago, I saw this film during a class where we previously read the play. The play was satisfactory, meaning I understood it and did not hate it. After reading the play, we saw the movie. I loved it. I could not stop laughing. It was just so corny beyond belief. Parts that were not supposed to be humorous, were. For example, the first scene in the gas station was absolutely hilarious with them jumping around shooting.<br/><br/>I thought that the old English applied to the modern stuff was not realistic or necessary, but I thought it was funnier then hell. It was hilarious how they all spoke in such ridiculous wordings as they preformed these actions.<br/><br/>For those who hated this film, I just have to say that you cannot take these things really seriously. The play is outdated now, and will be in the future. Back then, it was great! In addition, they cannot change the words, because then it wouldn't be true to the play. So, just take this with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>I loved when Romeo killed Tybalt. That was so corny and ridiculous I fell on the floor laughing. When the rain cloud burst over head, when he rammed his car into Tybalt's car, it was so hilarious.<br/><br/>I have nothing but good memories about this film.<br/><br/>WARNING: If you expect a scene for scene regurgitation, then this is not for you. I seriously recommend reading this play before hand, unless it will be so confusing. Oh, and I hated the original film. I couldn't understand it and fell asleep after the first part with the prince."

","I can't help but love this film. Maybe because i'm a huge luhrmann fan, i love hes red curtain movies and the distinctive and lavish cinematography of them.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect to me in this adaption of the worlds most famous love story was the casting of claire danes and leo DiCaprio. They were good but not brilliant. Shakespeare is about the language and there's no point in portraying a Shakespeare play if you do not deliver the dialoge properly. Claire tended to rush the lines and not let her mouth open up to get it around the words. It sometimes felt like she fully didn't understand the text of what she was saying. I can really see that should would have needed strong direction as some of her gestures, they way she moved and spoke seemed forced. Physically she looked every inch like a juliet with her curious eyes and young features.<br/><br/>Leo i think did a better job than danes in the fact that he had a lot of passion but with his characterization, his actions spoke louder than words. The scene where we are introduced to romeo with his voice over made me cringe and because this was the first time in the film we were hearing him speak Shakespeare, it left me in a lot of doubt having to hear him in the rest of the film, not a good start. However the scene where he watches juliet dance with Paris made up for it. In some scenes he over acted in other's not enough. I personally think the love scenes should have been A lot more intense, it was to tender. Romeo and juliet is not suppose to be all prettied-up but brutal and powerful both in violence and romance.<br/><br/>I can now sit back and look past those glitches and take in the film because i don't think baz would have been able to find 2 other actors to portray those roles any better than leo and claire. If anything other young actors would have probably given the same performance.Leo and claire do NOT make me dislike the film in the slightest though. I was driven to near tears during the beautiful fish tank scene it was like a fantasy, the whole Capulet ball sequence was like a fantasy. The way they suddenly jumped up and began searching each other with there eyes made you really believe that it was love at first site. That has got to be one of the most stunning pieces on film. Of course the death scene. I liked they they twisted it a bit so that instead of juliet waking to find romeo dead she watches him and looks into his eyes alive for the last time before reuniting in death. For those teenagers that were saying 'why didn't she say something to stop him from killing himself' it's this simple..............you can't re-write history. We all know how it ends but it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat while watching it unfold.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the film in a lot of ways but at the end of the day, it's entertaining and beautiful and tragic, and thats what romeo and juliet, the story is about. Baz has not let anyone down, he has not killed the play, he ha re-invented it for today's generation."

","Wow I love this movie because first off Leo plays a really sexy Romeo but also because this movie is really great. The way they mixed up Shakespeare's work is amazing. Claire Danes is a great Juliet but I wish I was Juliet so I could make out with Leo. I love this movie and you should see it too. The part where Romeo poisons himself and when Juliet kills herself is sad. It's also sad because Romeo and Juliet never got to run away and enjoy life as husband and wife, and be free from their relatives who hated each other so much. They would of lived if the relatives could just get along. I loved how they set it in modern times with Shakespeare's work so he could get credit. This movie is a total twist of the original. That's why I love this movie. I LOVE LEO DICAPRIO"
"gavin6942","9","0","2","22 October 2006"," Baz Luhrmann is the Master of Interpretation
","Prior to watching ""Romeo and Juliet"", I had seen ""Moulin Rouge"" a few times and loved it. Luhrmann took an opera by Puccini (""La Boheme"") and made a great tale of it, with music and visuals that will blow your mind. (""Rent"" is also based on ""La Boheme"", but is trite and caters to an audience I am not a part of.) My expectations for ""Romeo and Juliet"" were fairly high, given my admiration of Luhrmann.<br/><br/>As you can guess by my 9 out of 10 rating, I was not disappointed. Luhrmann took the classic Shakespeare and super-imposed it over modern day Verona Beach. Like ""Moulin Rouge"" where he took modern rock songs and placed them in 1900 France, here he takes the language of Shakespeare and places it in the contemporary. Rather than simply changing the dialog to modern usage, he gave the text its due.<br/><br/>This works incredibly well, and makes the film so much better than regular language would. The story seems richer, more epic and most importantly timeless. And the story is the story of love, which is just that: rich, epic and timeless.<br/><br/>And the visuals were stunning! The colors set a mood (such as the darkness after Mercutio's death) and there was such vibrancy in the clothing. The water theme resonated well, with great effects of seeing a lover for the first time through a fish tank, the rain falling at key moments, and the film focusing on both a beach and near a swimming pool.<br/><br/>Luhrmann knows how to direct John Leguizamo, and I would say this is one of his two best roles (the other being ""Moulin Rouge""). Harold Perrineau (Mercutio) shows great range, much more so than in other roles he's had since (""The Matrix"" or TV's ""Lost""). And this is probably the most un-funny Jamie Kennedy you'll ever see, which I mean in the most positive way.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is a delightful Juliet, giving a memorable performance (easily the peak of her career). She is physically perfect for the role, young and beautiful without being overly vulnerable or sexed-up. The only other actress I can picture capable of this kind of role is Julia Stiles, but I can't see her being as much of a fit and she would likely over-act... her Shakespeare style and Luhrmann's are not in synchronicity.<br/><br/>The role of Romeo, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was perfect. Nobody could have been better. This isn't the young Leo from before or the rough and rugged Leo that appears in films later on. This is the Leo on the verge of adulthood, but still remaining tender enough to have the youthful idealism of a Romeo. As my co-viewer phrased it, he's a ""babe"" (in more ways than she meant). I know of no other actor who has the acting abilities of Leo, at least not in his age range. He has a long career ahead of him if he can keep up the intensity he has here (as well as in ""The Departed"" and ""Gangs of New York""... though not as much in ""The Beach"").<br/><br/>A slight note on the music: As much as I love the Cardigans, I almost think ""Lovefool"" was a poor choice for this film... too poppy. But everything else was great: Butthole Surfers, Everclear, and especially One Inch Punch with the inspired ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". And Garbage, a vastly under-appreciated band, with one of their better tunes, ""#1 Crush"". A great album for a great film.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, your life is not complete. I went eleven years avoiding Romeo and Juliet, but having now broken my vow, I am glad I did. This film doesn't just impress, it inspires."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","2","21 October 2006"," Hip and intense modernization
","I hadn't heard all of this story before watching this film, so please forgive me any misunderstandings that may come as a result of that ignorance. When I heard that this was done by Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, who later went on to create Moulin Rouge together, which is one of my favorite love stories(granted, at the time I first saw it, that was a pretty short list) of all time, as well as just about the only true musical that I've found myself enjoying, naturally I was going to watch it. Plus, it's difficult to challenge the quality of William Shakespeare's writings, and this is said to be one of his best works. The idea is magnificent; take the original story and retell it in modern day suburbia, with the original dialog(though, obviously, unfortunately, not all the dialog could be retained; I was disappointed to find that the brief exchange regarding ""how deep was the cut"" was not in the film). The result works out very well, by changing the setting to one that today's youth can easier relate to, whilst still making the points that the original play did. The plot is very good, and evolves nicely throughout. The pace is *intense*. This thing moves non-stop. Blink and you'll miss something. At times, this speed was almost overwhelming. The running time is two (exactly!) hours, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost all of it. The editing seems to bear traces of this... more often than not, it seems like the scene or certain cuts of it had been trimmed by a few seconds, to ensure the run-time length, and it can be a little confusing(for the quite few times it happens). I will say that Luhrmann kept the pace at an appropriate rate for the dramatic scenes. In fact, they may become even stronger, from the otherwise extreme pace. The line-delivery is fast, but exceptional. The acting is excellent. I can't name a single performance that I found even slightly flawed. The casting is marvelous, as well... the two leads and the supporting players are spot-on(heck, even Jamie Kennedy worked, here). The music is a good mix of hip, new music and a beautiful score. Production values are high. The cinematography causes a confusing moment or two, but it mostly simply serves to keep the intensity up. A well-done modernization of the famous play. I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it, and/or William Shakespeare. Do keep in mind that there are various creative decisions made, changing the original tale... including one regarding the famous ending. 8/10"
"phenomynouss","8","0","1","4 October 2006"," A surprisingly original idea
","In my personal opinion, I believe Shakespeare's writing is way too obscure and out there, and think those people who say ""Shakespeare wrote for the common people"" and such are either blatantly lying to us schoolchildren, or I can only cringe in terror at what plays written for educated people must have sounded like.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't change the dialect or dialog of the movie, and gives it a weird sort of artistic modern setting, which makes it not only a surprising and original twist, but makes it much more watchable to see a timeless tale truly tested with its claim to timelessness. Even if it took place in the year 3010 AD, it'd still be the same.<br/><br/>I love the way the adults on the newscasts and police speak, and the way the police officer at the end of the movie scolds the Capulets and Montagues, and the beginning scene, with the Montague nerds biting their thumbs at the Capulets was amusing.<br/><br/>The guy who plays Mercutio (I think he also plays Link in the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) is spellbinding, and John Leguizamo is equally spectacular in this movie.<br/><br/>What keeps this movie from a 9 or a 10 in my opinion is the two lead characters played abysmally by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. DiCaprio, normally a great actor, sounds like he's just memorized the lines and is reciting them like a schoolchild forced to read them aloud in class--lifeless, with little to no emotion, and an apparent lack of understanding as to what he is saying.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is even worse, delivering lines in such an awkward manner as to make me cringe. It sounds literally like a giggly, bubbly school girl reading from a script for the first time while distracted by something else.<br/><br/>Another thing which surprisingly irritated me was the SCREAMING. In many scenes, there was mindless screaming at the hands of Juliet's mother and maid, especially that scene where Romeo is at Juliet's window, and the maid calls for her, and Danes (awkwardly) says ""By and by I come"", the maid's line is literally *takes deep breath*:<br/><br/>JULIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!<br/><br/>for at the very least, 5-10 seconds long<br/><br/>There's a lot more screaming at the maid's hand and Juliet's mother, though thankfully it's limited just to that scene and scarcely any other. But it is SERIOUSLY annoying having her scream like that when Juliet is CLEARLY shouting back ""By and by I come"""

","Baz Lurhman's Romeo + Juliet has both good and bad. the visuals and modernised Verona are spectacular and sumptuous, while DeCaprio and Danes leave some to be desired. The supporting cast is strong and holds together this crazy film though quality Shakespearean acting and a sense of fun that is severely lacking in most Shakespeare films. I personally have a problem with the main portrayals because neither is particularly adept at playing Shakespeare modernly and convincingly. the portrayals of Tybalt, Mercutio, Friar Lawrence and the Prince stand out and are excellent modern interpretations. the use of gun can seem forced at times but is understandable and fits with the visual style. The film is chaotic and is not for everyone ( several of my roommates absolutely despise it) but it can be a refreshing look at Shakespeare. Ultimately, individual taste plays heavily into opinion; while it is definitely worth seeing you may decide never to watch it again after."

","It's a nice idea: putting the original text of Romeo and Juliet into a modern, urbanised, setting. It will appeal to a much younger audience (making it instantly suitable for classroom use) and it will show the world that what Shakespeare wrote is still applicable to modern day. Unfortunately, it did not work out the way it should have. One of the fatal flaws was that the text was not followed as closely as I would have liked it. In fact, things were added that were hideously out of place and two important parts that should have been included have been omitted. However, it is virtually impossible to create an exciting film without playing with the text a little, so the writers have been forgiven as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>The one thing that I really cannot let pass is the combination the setting makes with the text. Keeping the original text with a modern setting has been done successfully in the past. The director here chose to make the setting and its characters over the top. The way the young Montagues and the young Capulets are portrayed may be clear, but it is also annoying to see that the Montagues are shown as surfer/stoners and the Capulets as Latino gangsters. This, combined with the setting, decors and acting makes for a film that is extremely over the top. This simply does not work with a text that is subtle, where most of the humour and entertainment is to be had from small quips and remarks, not from broad-sweeping statements and grandeur. Especially the love between Romeo and Juliet should be quiet, not playful as it is in this film.<br/><br/>Of course there are some good things about this film. In keeping with Shakespeare's love of subtle word jokes, this film has quite a few. There are several 'hidden' hints to other Shakespearean plays. Also, I liked the newscaster as opening chorus. This gave the film an air of modernity while still keeping the goal of the prologue, which is introducing the play. These things made for a two hours that were not completely awful.<br/><br/>I am somewhat of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare, although I do like it when people take freedoms with the text or the setting. However, Romeo + Juliet strayed too far from the nest."

"dunmore_ego","6","0","1","13 June 2006"," More Comedy Than Tragedie.
","All I'm saying is: Leonardo DiCaprio should stop being prettier than his female co-stars. In *Romeo and Juliet*, snub-nosed Claire Danes bravely steps up to out-femme Leo's manly prettiness. And fails. <br/><br/>Leonardo is Romeo (kinda archly poetic, no?) and Claire is his Juliet. Shakespeare's retelling of Ovid's *Pyramus and Thisbe* is retold with creative conceptualizing and high-voltage visuals by Australian thunderboy, director Baz Luhrmann, as an urban gang battle with a decidedly MTV-ian thrust. <br/><br/>Alas, Luhrmann's noble idealism in re-inventing the Bard's most famous play for a generation weaned on music videos and boy bands unfortunately falls on ears deaf to irony, sarcasm, double entendre, punning, words larger than six letters and intelligence. Which pretty much rules out Shakespeare's *oeuvre*. <br/><br/>Throwing out major portions of text (""Text? What's that?"" mumbles Generation X), yet elocuting the remainder verbatim, performances are unevenly astounding, for when the actors can stop shouting at each other in the manner of Entertainment Tonight hosts declaring showbiz headlines, their occasional fluidity creates pockets of crystal clarity that move with the rhythms Shakespeare intended. Alas, it is unsustainable for most of them. <br/><br/>Thrown into this mix of varying talents, Dash Mihok, Jamie Kennedy (it was all I could do to stop imagining them prefacing everything with ""Yo yo yo"") and DiCaprio stand out like ailing speechaphobics against the menacing fluidity of John Leguizamo, the simple sincerity of Claire Danes and the authoritative Shakespearean veteran, Pete Postlethwaite (still pushing 55, as he was 20 years ago).<br/><br/>As Mercutio, cross-dressing Harold Perrineau steals the show in his mini-skirt, bra and command of Shakespearean rhythm. And look at those legs!<br/><br/>The precursor to all Chick Flicks, you know the old story: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, girl drinks poison, boy kills himself, girl wakes up, girl kills herself. Ain't love grand?"
"adri278","10","0","1","12 June 2006"," This movie is something to be appreciated.
","This best word I can think of to describe this movie is vibrant. The bright colors, vivid scenery and outlandish characterization are trademarks of Luhrmann's style, and I for one think that it is cinematography at its best. He brings us into the world of Shakespeare in a way no one else has. I saw this movie in the theater when I was 11 and it prompted me to buy the play and ever since then I have been in love with it. I appreciate Baz's attempt at aiming the story to a younger audience. You don't find many kids these days (or ten years ago...has it really been that long??) who want to willingly read Shakespeare. The language is complicated and unfamiliar. But the stories are worth knowing, and I think this movie is a step forward in familiarizing Shakespeare to the modern times.<br/><br/>There are plenty of people who disagree with the use to Shakespeare's dialogue in the modern setting. I have argued this point over and over and this is what I have to say to them: It seems that someone who appreciates Shakespeare would want his brilliant words to be used. You see the movie and you think: Baz Luhrmann, you hear the dialogue and you think: William Shakespeare. If you are someone who can't understand Shakespeare, the makers of the film dedicated themselves to finding ways, by using imagery, to decode the language and make it more understandable.<br/><br/>I've often heard complaints about the acting in this movie as well. I for one don't see anything wrong with the acting, and I thought the cast did very well with the difficult dialogue. I've always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio. Back when I first saw this movie, it was just because I thought he was cute. But now, I see an actor who plays his roles with intensity and passion. He is the perfect Romeo to me. He portrays the passionate, lovesick lead incredibly well. We see his heart break on the screen when Mercutio is slain, and again when he learns of Juliet's ""death."" We see his all-consuming rage when he is chasing after Tybalt to avenge his friend's death. We see a boy falling in love with a girl and wanting to be with her for the rest of his life. He goes though all of these emotions seamlessly, and in the end, you really don't want this guy to die.<br/><br/>Claire Danes as Juliet impressed me as well. She has a much less flashy role than Leo, but she brings strong character to the innocent, angelic young woman. My favorite parts with her were when she was alone, speaking to herself. I really thought she did the dialogue very well, and she is often who I think of when I read the play. She handles the emotional stuff with experience, and you are left there wishing you could do something for this girl who goes through so much in such a short time.<br/><br/>My favorite character in the movie has to be Meructio, played by Harold Perrineau. He's loud, flamboyant, and I can't get enough of him when he is on the screen. He even dresses in drag at the costume party where Romeo and Juliet meet, and lip-syncs to ""Young Hearts Run Free."" He plays the loyal friend with feeling, and it is very disappointing when he meets his end.<br/><br/>This movie definitely isn't for everyone. Some people just can't quite grasp what Luhrmann was trying to accomplish with this movie. He wasn't trying to do a replica of the play or the movies made before it. It's different. It's daring. Some parts might just make you laugh out loud. But the tragedy of the story is still very much there.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is something to be appreciated. It steps out of the norm and pulls you into a world of love and tragedy with its intense delivery and unique portrayal of a timeless story."

","Though I did not get to see the ending, this reincarnation of Romeo & Juliet rings truer to the original than I thought it would. Several lines are ""copied and pasted"" to other parts of the film: in the beginning before the Capulet's party, for instance, Romeo takes a pill from Mercutio that resembles Ecstasy. The line, ""The drugs are quick,"" taken from Act 5, completes the image nicely along with hazy, quick-cut scenes from the party. The added clumsiness of Romeo was a sweet touch to the character that Leo D.Caprio conveyed rather well: the man cannot stop falling into the pool during the balcony scene. He also crashes into a candle stand in the church while he's begging Father Laurence to perform his and Juliet's marriage ceremony. Fell on his face... I laughed. Claire Danes was a bit much for me, I must admit... when she screams at Lord Capulet's character it hurt my ears. ""Proud can I never be of what I HATE,"" Ow.... ow... but overall it was a good film.

If you wanted to make a better film, you could've made it like the film ""O"" based on Othello. O didn't have that dialogue and it still was quite an enjoyable film. Overall, Leonardo's great looks and the big cast didn't make this an entertaining film and that goes along with the dialogue too! <br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 5/10 *+ D"

","I was really surprised how good this film was, when i first saw it i found myself getting bored. However when i saw it the second time i was gripped. Even though it used Shakespearean language i found that i could follow the dialogue. Leonardo Dicaprio was fantastic in this film, a very believable character and i found the violence, as brutal as it was, very necessary. I was also really happy that Juliets character wasn't as melodramatic as she always seems to be and also less innocent. As weird as it is i find the opening scene, after the reporter on the t.v, one of my favourite scenes. The way it is presented is astounding, the music, the text and the speech it great. The way they incorporated the story into a modern setting is so clever and even though they use the Shakespearean language i didn't find it out of place. Overall i found this film truly remarkable and a certain classic."

","Luhrmann is without a doubt a genius of a man. One of the most tricky things in bring relics into our current reality is keeping it as authentic as the first day it rolled out onto stage. Shakespeare is no easy man to copy and even more difficult to imitate.<br/><br/>DiCaprio wasn't the best choice for Romeo as far as the dialog and acting bits are concerned. Don't get me wrong, he's a great actor, but lacks the ability to play tough when the time comes for it. From what I understand, Romeo was a decent swordsman as the play recalls. However, little action came from the guns portrayed as the weapon of choice to match the time period.<br/><br/>Harold Perrineau, who played Mercutio, had a crucial role in this film as the best friend of the dear Romeo and more than anything else, protector of Romeo's dreams. It was an outstanding performance because I truly believed that Mr. Perrineau new the emotions and dialog well enough to portray them realistically.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is just an outstanding actress with beauty all around and a more honest approach to the Juliet in this film. It's not easy playing a love interest, but in this movie, it's clear that both DiCaprio and Danes played love interest to each other instead of one or the other.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo is an accomplished comedian, so portraying the ever serious and straight forward Tybalt just didn't seem the role for him. I think that Leguizamo is trying to approach all angles of his acting career which takes much talent, but once you're a comedian that stands out, it's difficult to get out of that genre.<br/><br/>I'd have given this movie better than an 8 if not for the fact that it was relatively uneventful. It's a Tragic Love Story. You can't really expect much more."

","I would say that this film is made for the MTV generation except for the fact that any generation can easily sit through a couple of hours to watch this triumphant film. The story is old and well known to most. The actors seem like hotties with experienced actors, and on paper this would have been hard to argue against, but solid acting all around with great innovation (guns for swords, set in modern day) it holds up well and creates reputations for actors otherwise considered 'eye candy'. Two people come off very well in my opinion, Leonardo Dicaprio (as Romeo) and John Leguizamo (as Tybalt). With Leo playing the part of someone who thinks he's is in love to actually falling in love and Leguizamo as the relative with hatred and anger which is channeled greatly towards his foe. Well thought through and some times cool, Baz Luhrmann (director) pulls out all the stops and defies expectation, truly spectacular!"

","My English class was discussing this movie after having read the play. I love the movie because of the way Baz Lurhman uses modern imagery and contrasts it with the original lines of the play. Though he does use modern imagery like guns, if you look at the guns it says ""9 mm Sword..."" (Lurhman). I found that very ironic and humorous. There was one thing in the movie I didn't like and that was that Baz Lurhman made Mercutio Gay and totally threw off the actual basis of the play. Shakespeare makes it evident in the play that there is something ""more"" between Romeo and Mercutio but I think Lurhman emphasized it just a little to much. Another idea of the movie that I find intriguing about the movie is how at the beginning Lurhman switches the lines of the Capulets and the Montagues. This I believe that Lurhman was trying to manipulate the lines of Act1:Sc1 to direct the audiences into his interpretation of the families. As I said before the movie was awesome, To Lurhman "" try to do another of Shakespeare's play the way you did Romeo and Juliet I would go and see it."" If another one is made like this I go and see it (last few words directed towards Baz Lurhman).<br/><br/>Geni12591"

","After reading the first page of the IMDb readers' ""Comments"" filtered in order of ""Best"" Comments, I found myself agreeing with most, and even learning historical tidbits and artistic insights to enhance future viewings. Since other readers said it so well, I have only one question: With all the potential actresses who could have played Juliet, why Claire Danes? <br/><br/>Though appropriately young and innocent contrasting against the debauched culture backdrop, throughout the entire movie her northern homeliness seemed improbable to have diverted Romeo's romantic spark from Rosline, ab alluring siren by his friend Mercutio's description, guaranteed to keep an impressionable and romantic young man ensnared.<br/><br/>Claire's hair poorly dyed at the roots in a color conflicting with her natural pallor and lacking life and shine was fine for her death scene, but not captivating prior. (Picture Greek actress Jennifer Anniston's shining, moving tresses mutely but eloquently attesting to a pampered upbringing and great south-of-the-equator genetic heritage.) Likewise Claire's pasty skin tone and lack of feature definition requiring makeup she was denied except way too late some too-dark and earthbound brick lipstick clashing not only with her coloring but her angelic costume for the big party. <br/><br/>Italian girls' beauty is in curving black eyebrows arching like flying swallows above thickly fringed lashes lowering modestly over shy but alluringly smoldering dark eyes while thick glossy ringlets toss and curve around plump skin warmed by cloudless sunny Mediterranean skies. (Think Latin lovers and salsa dancers.) Does this describe Claire Danes? Not at all!<br/><br/>Instead we're served up a pasty pale girl from north of the Equator who looks like the Dane she is named from chilly overcast Denmark, with crudely common peasant features. My neighbors are prettier than this flat-chested, dull-colored, severely-in-need-of-makeup girl who should be cast as a Puritan maid to a rich scion of the estate who falls in love with her because prolonged proximity teaches him maturely to appreciate her grateful sweetness and trustworthy salt-of-the earth soul. A far cry from the instantly captivating, imagination-firing, arrestingly demure but hotly passionate Capulet little rich girl.<br/><br/>Claire's best visual trait is easily and quickly identified since she was gifted with so little aesthetically; but she wastes that lively smile prematurely in her scenes so that it feels coyly contrived, like a cute little masked clown instead of the ingenuously spontaneous eruption out of a girlish soul trembling on the threshold of new womanly feelings...shakily unfamiliar but at the same time deliciously tempting to be explored with this suddenly appearing object for her adoration--intense, beautiful, and ardorous young Romeo.<br/><br/>I longed for a prior Juliet--innocently sultry and husky-voice Olivia Hussey, a petite little hussy of a princess--opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. Or even Marisa Tomei, who always seems young, hot-headed and vulnerable. Or even the youngest ""Gilmore Girl"" (though not typically Italian), with her big eyes, shiny hair, and lovely young body delicately yielding to new sensuality. We want a girl on her first date and prom, a Snow White awakened by her youthful Prince charming, not a tomboy. <br/><br/>This artistic production was such an original piece and so vividly delivered that the colorless Claire was an even bigger disappointment to me here than she would have been in a more pedestrian production of the classic Romeo & Juliet. I'm sure I'll enjoy this actress in future movies better suited, since IMDb readers' comment enthusiastically about her; but she stops me from wanting to own this otherwise artistic and moving rendition of the poetry of Romeo & Juliet."

","This movie is great because it shows a girl who never makes her own decisions. Her father is rich and her mother sets her up with the most available bachelors she can.

Romeo likes his best friend, but he just needs to be by himself sometimes. I love all the religious symbols in the movie too. The Capulets like to where gang-like clothes and the Montagues more of a Hawaiin t-shirt collection. My favorite scene is the pool hall. It takes the written words from the book and puts them in a place where people can understand what Romeo is going through. I give the movie an 8 because I hate the ending.

","When I was in 9th grade, my English class was studying Romeo and Juliet and as luck would have it, this version was in theatres! Unfortunately, my English teacher felt the modern setting and teen dream stars were an affront to Shakespeare's classic play and while the other class got to go see it, we were stuck watching the version from the 70s in a dimly lit library on a 20"" set. She even fast-forwarded through the love scenes. Its that type of person that will likely hate this movie, and while they don't really deserve it, lets all take a moment to pity their lack of adventure and youthful exuberance that this story clearly embodies.<br/><br/>OK... now on to the review.<br/><br/>Most teenagers when they first learn about Shakespeare will likely begin with Romeo & Juliet. Its a popular and easily digestible tale. And most students will probably have a slightly difficult time with the language, but the meaning of the lines will not be lost on them with this modernized version by celebrated director Baz Luhrman. Carefully chosen images intermingle with the lines and soon you forget about the strangeness of the language and are engrossed in the story, as Shakespeare himself would've intended.<br/><br/>Starring in the lead roles are talented stars and character actors, even some super stars like DiCaprio, and with music courtesy of Radiohead, how can you go wrong? While the contemporary setting may turn some people off, they are missing the point.<br/><br/>The point is, the time and place are essentially unimportant. Young love can happen anywhere and at anytime, and often does. So what does it matter if you have guns instead of swords? Or a mardi-gras style party instead of a stuffy costumed affair? What is important is that the audience feel connected to the original material, and despite its archaic language, truly FEEL the emotions the way Shakespeare intended.<br/><br/>Thats what I love about this version. Even the uninitiated will lose any predisposition about the language, maybe even come to appreciate it! through a cleverly updated depiction they can more easily relate to.<br/><br/>I give it a 10/10 because its awesome."

","Baz Luhrmann's superb version of Romeo and Juliet met and surpassed my expectations. When I heard that it would have Leonardo DiCaprio in it I imagined he wouldn't make the cut but he seems surprisingly natural when showing Romeo's emotions in Shakespearian dialogue. The fact that they cast Harold Perrineau (Michael from LOST) as a cross-dressing Mercutio would seem ridiculous but it somehow works well. However, I do feel that Tybalt needed to show more of an understanding of his words and that Romeo's parents were under-used. The pure 90's songs took me back to when I was still in primary school and made me smile as ""You and Me Always"" comes on when Romeo is coming to arrange his marriage. The ending (which I must note changed slightly as Romeo normally dies a while before Juliet wakes up) still makes me cry and want Romeo to see Juliet stirring, and Juliet's sorrow as Romeo dies in her arms is beautifully played by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. The fact that they kept in the original text and thus changed the actual swords to gun makes of 'Sword' 'Dagger' and 'Blade' was an excellent transition from Shakespeare's times. The majority of the actors seem comfortable in speaking Elizabethan English and you get a feeling of a new kind of slang to be used by gangs in the lines. All in all, one of my ""top ten movies you must see before you die""."

","If Shakespeare were alive today, he would probably be a Hollywood writer/director, and would most likely approve of this updated version! One has to remember that in his day, Shakespearean theater was not ""high society"" entertainment, but was rather looked down upon as ""vulgar"" and as the popular entertainment of the day! Director Baz Luhrmann keeps the original text of Shakespeare intact, but updates the setting to modern-day. While at first strange, the juxtaposition of modern setting and Elizabethan dialogue DO work, and give the audience (especially those of the younger generation) a truer and better appreciation and understanding of this classic play."

"twinkle1984","8","0","1","22 November 2005"," film review compared to Shakespeare's original intent of his play
","In the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, perversion of reason is one of the main motifs. During the Renaissance, reason was a moral concept that allied humans with God and distinguished them from the beasts. The concept implied having right love that is governed by reason and not lustful passions or the worshiping of idolatries. Shakespeare's intent of Romeo and Juliet is to show a right type of love through a love that is lustfully wrong. According to Elizabethan values, true love goes beyond surface appearances, guided by reason and clear-sightedness; more specifically, it accords with Divine law. Wrong love is excessive and idolatress, based solely on appearances. The relationship of Romeo and Juliet portrays wrong love to show that this type of love can only end in tragedy. Consequently, the film, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet attempts to mimic Shakespeare's intent; however fails to achieve the overall meaning that is expressed in the original play. <br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann, the director of the film keeps some element of Shakespeare's original intent in his film. The film appears to take place within three to seven days. Romeo and Juliet are both young, and the hastiness in the film parallels the hastiness in the play through Mercutio. However, these similar elements are not strong enough to argue that the film version of Romeo and Juliet is truly Shakespeare's intent. In reality the Baz Luhrmann film makes the ""lovers"" appear as if they represent right love. <br/><br/>The music in the film is a key part of this aspect. Love songs such as # 1 crush, Angel, Kissing You, and You and Me song surround Romeo and Juliet whenever they are together. They are uplifting tunes that trick the viewer into seeing Romeo and Juliet as the epitome of right love. <br/><br/>The film also has Romeo and Juliet surrounded in bright sunlight or luminous lit up rooms. Light images gives viewers the impression that Romeo and Juliet's ""love"" is godly, holy, and a right type of love. Clearly, this is not Shakespeare's intent. In his play, Shakespeare has Romeo and Juliet surrounded in dark imagery. The absence of light (Juliet is Romeo's light) symbolizes that their love is doomed.<br/><br/>Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.<br/><br/>It was the nightingale and not the lark,<br/><br/>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.<br/><br/>Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.<br/><br/>Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. (Rom 3.5.1-5) Shakespeare uses the darkness imagery for a reasonto show that Romeo and Juliet's love is wrong. <br/><br/>A specific difference that shows Shakespeare's intent was not portrayed throughout the film was the scene where Romeo and Juliet first meet. In the play, readers clearly know that Romeo is wearing a mask when he arrives at the Capulet's party. There is no evidence throughout the text that Romeo takes his mask off when he first meets Juliet. This scene is essential to the play and Shakespeare's intent because it symbolizes the blindness and false appearance in Romeo and Juliet's love. Nevertheless, in Luhrman's film, Romeo arrives at the Caplet's party wearing a mask, yet removes it before he met Juliet. <br/><br/>Act Three of Romeo and Juliet is a crucial part in Shakespeare's play. The fighting scene between Mercutio, Romeo and Tybalt show the disorderly and uncontrollable passion that runs throughout Shakespeare's play. Bez Luhrman's film version of the scene captures Shakespeare's intended likeness of the play, perfectly. The film portrays the wild, runaway passions of the three extreme characters. Different than the play, a storm is beginning to form that prepares the reader for tragedy, specifically with the wind and thundering. Furthermore, since Shakespeare's work is a play, the actual description of the fight between Tybalt and Mercutio is not stated, the editor only puts in the stage direction: ""They Fight."" With Luhrman's film, viewers are able to see a violent fight taking place that results in Mercutio's inevitable wound.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is in a modern society. Shorts and Hawaiian shirt replace Renaissance gowns and men wearing tightsha-ha. In stead of swards, guns are the weapons (yet, they are referred to as swards in the movie). The effect of these modern day attributes is what makes the film worth watching. Viewers of the film can relate and appreciate the film as Elizabethans could have related to the play when it had been performed in the Renaissance. <br/><br/>Luhrmann's film adds up to a coherent whole by following through with the director's point of view of the lovers. He sees Romeo and Juliet as a story about the right type of love and is consistent throughout by surrounding the lovers in bright light and love songs. Therefore Baz Fuhrman's William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is a good film for only students of Shakespeare. Students of Shakespeare know the true intent of Romeo and Juliet and the values and concerns that had surrounded Elizabethans. Therefore, students can appreciate Luhrmann's interpretation of the film while also taking into consideration Shakespeare's interpretation of right love and reason. The general public, however, may not know Renaissance background and the concepts of reason, right vs. wrong love, and appearance vs. reality. Thus, the general public could misinterpret the film or not even understand it at all. <br/><br/>Works Cited<br/><br/>Shakespeare, William. The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Ed. Sylvan Barnet.

"acisnotsped86","8","0","1","18 November 2005"," Creative interpretation of Shakespeare's Great Love story
","I will be the first to admit bias because I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. However, much credit must also be given to the creative team for their modern remake of R&J. The movie, like Moulin Rouge as one example, has put a great deal of time into costume, settings and music. As a side note, the soundtrack for R&J is phenomenal and I still listen to it nearly 10 years later. The story stays very true to the play with Elizabethan English instead of modern English. One big surprise is the portrayal of Mercutio. All I can say is that this definitely was not Shakespeare's intention, but it's quite amusing. The use of Elizabethan English in a modern interpretation of Shakespeare has one evident drawback; seeing people in the modern age speaking in such a fashion can make the movie seem a bit silly at times. Other than that, I loved it and the romantic aspect in the movie was so well done. I simply wish that the DiCaprio and Danes had a better cast working with them. Particularly for the parents. No excuses for not finding older actors who can handle Shakespeare, especially since they found the aforementioned stars who handled it quite well."

And if I was a chick, I'd totally hit that :P<br/><br/>Also brilliant was the sets, costumes, and pretty much everything! The last thing that made it awesome for me was the soundtrack.

Those things were in to please the upper-class and the ""critics"". But the Globe had a pit. Where the poor filed in for a good show. While Zeffirelli's version is how the events would have played out in real life, Luhrmann's adaptation is true to how the drama would have been played out on the stage. There's really nothing like hearing the meter of Shakespeare's writing come out in the fast paced dialogs that fills this film.

","I first fell in love with Shakespeare's story of the most well-known star-crossed lovers my freshman year in high school, whereupon I read the play and acted out the part of Juliet in my Global Cultural Studies class. (And ever since then, I have dreamed of playing Juliet). It's hard to describe why exactly I feel this way, though it's one of (if not, the) my favorites. I received this 1996 version with young DiCaprio and Danes as a present for my 15th birthday in May 2002. Since then, I have watched it several times, and once even in French. In my opinion, this is a wonderful life, and I was surprised by how accurately DiCaprio and Danes played the title roles. And, just as the producer had hoped (which he says on an interview on the DVD), having this play take place in modern times--in California--does help the viewers to understand Shakespeare's complex (yet beautiful) language, although now that I am in a Shakespeare class I would have understood it anyway. However, avid Shakespeareans may be upset with the ending of the play (this is the spoiler): instead of having Juliet wake up at least a couple minutes after Romeo has drunk the poisoned vial and died, Luhrmann decides to have Juliet and Romeo see each other right before his death--but unfortunately, they do not see each other in time to stop this horrible outcome. It has a quite a different effect, if you think about it!! Yet, one cannot help but just love the story nonetheless, and the fact that it's American and starring actors we know may make the film appear to us more. But whatever it is, I loved it!"

However, an incredible film, which is well worth taking a look at."

","William Shakespeare's masterpiece definitive romantic tale already had love, passion, tragedy and unbeatable literary genius. What Baz Luhrmann did was to turn up its volume, slap on the sunscreen and yell out (captured essentially through the way Leonardo DiCaprio cried in the murder scene) to the world in the midst of a 1996 drag party at the beach.<br/><br/>And what a scream it let out too. Whilst not initially blockbuster fare, it hit the underground and worked itself into the mainstream due to its raw energy- what later became the hallmark of Baz Lurhmann's film signatures when he completed 2001's now celebrated, Moulin Rouge. The film was yelling out to the world way ahead of its time. From the fashion in the film, the stylings of the film all the way to the flair and even hairstyle of the lead characters, this film oozed trend-setter. That it went on to launch Leonardo DiCaprio and his floppy fringe, furrowed brow and a cigarette dressed in a suit without a tie (spanning millions of teenage admirers and copycats the world over), was just the one element of the show's powerful placement as one of the defining pieces of cinema in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Till that time, teenage fare (if people even still consider this film to be as such) was considered fluffy - one must remember that the film was launched in 1996 - with only shows like 'My Own Private Idaho', 'Reality Bites' or even 'Clueless' before it, whilst it way ahead of the teenage movie formulaic explosion that took place after 1998/99, and even the better of those never could touch this film's raw energy, angst, stylistics nor emotion. That was how powerfully strong the undertones and reverberations surrounding this teenage culture defining movie of the 1990s was.<br/><br/>And yet again, it was not just a teen flick- it had the essence of literary prose still entrenched in within, it had a flair for style unseen in any movie at the time (thereby establishing Baz Lurhmann as a revolutionary), and combined with the editing, musical layout & soundtrack (The Wannadies, etc) and sparklingly romantic scenes like the 'fish tank' wooing sequence, it was pure Shakespeare with a twist, and a delectable shout at the beach to stop the world to take notice."

This is such a truths worthy and realistic movie, all authentic to the Shakespeare story except from that fact that the story is moved from Verona in the 16th century to present time in Verona Beach and some changed lines, some changed scenes and a bit modernized story. Beautiful scenes, beautiful cinematography, sad story, fine person chemistry between Danes and DiCaprio.

","Baz Luhrman did the impossible, altered a classic without making it seem horrible. Luhrman's portrayal of a modernized telling of Shakespeare's classic tale, hints a lot at underlying themes. When I was younger I thought this was a great love story, when you are older you understand that it is explaining the carelessness of teenagers and a lack of understanding of love. Leading and supporting actors deserved awards for their performances. But my absolutely favorite thing about Baz Luhrman films is his camera movement. It is just so creative, and holds your interest, your eyes scan the screen for what is happening next. Soundtrack and scenery is amazing. If you have not seen this movie yet, go out and get a copy."

The means by which the movie is modernized is hilarious, yet it did go back to a serious tone by the end, thank God. Shakespeare did intend for the first half of the play to be comic and the second half to be tragic, so the fact that Baz Luhrman went a little silly (but only in the first half) I think worked.<br/><br/>As far as quality goes, it was not very high quality Shakespeare, just fun. I recommend the 1968 version for higher quality Shakespeare and a more true experience (even though that one cut lots of lines too).<br/><br/>DO NOT use Romeo + Juliet to introduce you to Shakespeare or to Romeo and Juliet because it won't be successful.

It had the guns, the explosions, the hand to hand (or rather foot to stomach) and the romance . Luhrmann did well at getting around the problems that working by the original script presented (i.e the sword thing) as did the actors and actresses who had to stick so faithfully to the script although, from that point, I have probably my only criticism in that this version didn't stick as faithfully to the script as Zefferelli's. However that can be excused as your attention soon drifts away from the script and more onto the fabulous costumes and some of the brilliant cinematography an example is when Tybalt is shot and the camera switches and we see Romeo in what can only be described as a crucifix position and Tybalt floating in a pool of blood. As for the costumes the party and the gas station would have to be my favourites, those costumes were awesome! I recommend it."

I really enjoyed this version of William Shakespeare's famous play. I thought the acting was very good considering the script is in fact Shakespeare. Not all people will think this, but I thought the modern day, original script combination was brilliant. A lot of good cinematography, particularly in the last couple of scenes. <br/><br/>THE BAD: I didn't really enjoy the typical Luhrmann direction in the first half hour of the film, it just didn't seem to fit well with the piece. Like I said before, some people won't like the idea of putting the original Shakespeare script in the present time period. A lot of people are particular about the acting in Shakespeare movies, so it's really up to you to decide whether the acting is good or bad. <br/><br/>MY RATING: 7.5/10"
"dane-35","Null","0","1","15 August 2004"," Altogether an odd film
","A quite disturbing, but central, theme is the excruciating juxtaposition of Shakespeare's language with a set that itself is dynamic, regularly alienating the viewer by injecting continually new and intra-anachronistic points-of-reference, set in the archetypal image of 1950s' USA, so much so that it achieves a high level of self-parody. The discomfort sits so heavily that it deafens out the theme of joyous-blighted young love that the film is supposed to be about. The film is played without love.<br/><br/>Our Juliet (Claire Danes) is often inaudible. This is unfortunate, as there is no frisson in the body languages between her and her Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio): there is no passion evident in the affair. In both the ""bedroom"" scenes (night and morning after), grossly unsubtle heavy-handedness ensured that the audience was not to be presented with the full panoply of Juliet's breasts. Is this a cinematic retro respective to the 1950s? We think not: it is, rather, a successful attempt to ensure that the youth-DiCaprio market would not be prevented from seeing the film by a rating higher than PG-13. Oh, this film was made in 1996. The ""other"" Romeo & Juliet was made (in sumptuous velvachrome Ã  la Franco Zeffireli) - my maths tells me - twenty-eight years earlier in 1968. It is a truism that the '96 will be compared with the '68 - a truism because it already has been. In 1968, the audience was bravely offered a glimpse of Olivia Hussey. Appropriate, certainly. Coy, yes. In love with Romeo? Absolutely!<br/><br/>I make a meal of the issue as I see it as an indication, in the '96, of an aura of repression in cinema, and as a reflection of a society as a whole (as well as the whiff of profit), in the director's distinct lack of sex in the ""sex"" scenes. It might be self-censorship, but it is predicated on societal censorship. Is society pulling back from the freedoms won by the 1960s?<br/><br/>The quality of acting varies wildly throughout. The younger actors struggled with the text. The older actors took their parts brilliantly.<br/><br/>I've blasted it, perhaps, but would I recommend it? Yes. It is a coherent film and does offer a significant interpretation of the play. As I say, altogether an odd film."

As I watched, the movie was lacking very much until the scene where DiCaprio and Danes meet with ""Kissing You"" being sung in the background.  That part changed the whole movie for me because of the easily recognized chemistry between the two of them - all without saying a word.  Since then I have come to appreciate this movie even more, and watch anytime it's on TV.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent.  So good in fact, that the ending everyone knows will happen seems illogical - you believe they deserve so much better, that it will work out.  Leo showed why he was one of the best actors in Hollywood, pre-Titanic.  And I don't mean ""best under 25 or 30 years old,"" I mean overall.  Before the Titanic backlash, he was as solid as anyone. Also, Perrineau was unbelievable, stealing every seen he was in.  And Leguizamo again shows why is such a highly underrated actor.  I believe Danes was perfect casting for Juliet, nailing the role.<br/><br/>The style may turn a lot of people off, but Baz Luhrmann made it worked very well as he always does.  Overall, this is a very good movie carried by the exceptional performances of the mentioned actors and even Pete Postlethwaite in a small role being his usual solid self.<br/><br/>9/10"

Baz is wonderfully creative, and even if the results aren't entirely successful, there's still more imagination here than in many other mainstream films. And what about the scene at the party, where Romeo and Juliet regard each other through the fish tank? That is a genuinely lovely, tender moment, as is the balcony(or pool)scene.

And the only Verona Beach in the U.S. is in the state of New York.<br/><br/>Beyond the point of the geographical place of the filming locations lets not forget a very basic principle: movies are make-believe. This story is set in ""the fair Verona"", not in Verona, CA nor even in Verona, Italy. It is set in Romeo and Juliet's Verona where all this dramatic fantasy takes place.<br/><br/>Luhrmann's main achievement with this film was to create his own version of Shakespeare's classic. I don't know what was his or the producer's target market nor if the selection of then hot Leonardo was just to achieve box office success. The bottom line is that he created a new reality for this long-told story without even trying to convince the audience that this could be actually happening in our time.

"sp00ge","9","0","1","22 October 2003"," An brilliant revamp of a classic piece
","Baz Luhrman and Craig Pearce's interpretation of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet is a brilliant revamp of a classic piece.  Rather than taking the more traditional approach of capturing the story's essence but using a new script, Romeo + Juliet maintains the original Shakespeare script.  However Luhrman goes far beyond simply translating the play into a screenshow as so many filmmakers have done in the past.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a somewhat modern-day Verona with a strong flex of his poetic license muscle.  Swords are transformed into guns, horses to cars.  Prior to seeing the film, when I heard about it I was wildly skeptical of how it could be a good film.  I'm very much a Shakespeare fan and appreciate his works in their more ""original"" form.  However Luhrman does an astounding job of the transformations that take place and they actually work very well on screen.  It doesn't take a very big leap of faith on the audience's part to accept a gun for a sword.  It amazes me how well Shakespeare's script works in a modern setting.  On top of the translations, the visuals and filmography are very appealing and do the rest of the film justice.<br/><br/>I personally found the acting to be quite good throughout the film, however I'm not usually too nitpicky about acting, I try to see the film on the whole.  My personal favorites are Leguizamo as Tybalt and Danes as Juliet, and Perrineau as Mercutio.<br/><br/>Overall I consider the movie to be a fresh new approach to a very old classic.

"steinbergdavid","8","0","1","15 May 2003"," review of the film (my rating = 8/10) - may contain spoilers
","There are three types of Shakespeare films. The first are traditional Shakespeare films which remain wholly faithful to the original plays. The second are modernised Shakespeare films which update or contemporise certain aspects of the original plays while retaining Shakespearian language. The third are films which are loosely based on Shakespeare, usually just on the plot of the plays updating everything else including the language.<br/><br/> Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet retained the Shakespearian language but cast two unknown and definitely not Shakespearian teenage actors in the two main roles of Romeo and Juliet. The film cut some of the dialogue from the original play which the director felt was unnecessary and would bore the audience, not being vital to the story. The film contained several contemporary flourishes and was ultimately a visual feast of a film rather than a filmed play with theatrical sets and scenery. However, although it succeeded as a film rather than a filmed play, this version of Romeo and Juliet was almost entirely faithful to the original play in comparison to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet, which updated everything there is to update, while retaining the Shakespearian language, cutting unnecessary dialogue, updating the setting to Verona Beach, Los Angeles, replacing swords with guns, using cars, casting two very un-Shakepearian actors in the lead roles of Romeo and Juliet and more.<br/><br/> You cannot compare this film with Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet simply because you cannot compare a film whose plot is a modernised Shakespeare story and whose language is that of Shakepeare's original text (along with some editing) with a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play that may introduce several contemporary flourishes but nevertheless remains a traditional and faithful film version of the play. Zeffirelli's version is obviously the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, but likewise Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet is the best modernisation of Shakespeare's play. Luhrmann's version is essentially a film while Zefferelli's is essentially a play made into a film.<br/><br/> As for the quality of acting, the level of traditional Shakespearian acting is higher in Zeffirelli's than it is in Luhrmann's, which is why Luhrmann's is a true modernisation of the play. This is not Leonardo di Caprio's very best performance, but it ranks among his best, which include 'The Basketball Diaries', 'This Boy's Life' with Robert De Niro and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' in which he gives his undeniably greatest and easily most amazing performance as a mentally handicapped boy. His acting in the film was so convincing that people thought that the director had cast a real mentally handicapped boy in the role (Leonardo Di Caprio was unknown when he made the film in 1993).<br/><br/> Still, in Romeo+Juliet he shows good acting ability in his violence, passion, romance and the characteristic innocence and obsessional love of Romeo. Many people have complained that he speaks his lines as if they are meaningless and that he 'loses' the emphasis of some of the lines that he rapidly delivers. As for myself, I heard every line that he and all of the other actors spoke, and his unconventional rapid delivery of the lines only adds to the fast and furious atmosphere of the entirely unconventional film and emphasises the fact that the text mostly constitutes conversations between people, not soliloquys and speeches, although there are some. Therefore he makes his lines in conjunction with those of other actors in the film sound like part of a conversation, rather than delivering his lines slowly and deliberately, pausing after very important lines. People have also complained that Leonardo di Caprio goes 'way over the top', especially in the scene where he learns of Juliet's supposed death. However, this only adds to the atmosphere of the film, which is meant to be 'over the top'.<br/><br/> Also, the fact that the two main characters are played by two non-Shakespearian actors only emphasises the fact that they are ordinary people who have experienced a tragedy in their short lives, rather than Shakespearian actors who deliver their lines with far more pretention and exuding a higher status than those 'below' in the audience, as it would have seemed in theatres in Shakespeare's days and in theatres today. Admittedly, though, the two actors who play Romeo and Juliet in Zeffirelli's version are also non-Shakespearian actors.<br/><br/> Luhrmann's film is also an undeniable visual extravaganza, with contemporary flourishes of western-type shoot-outs and other alterations such as the balcony scene, controversially held in Juliet's swimming pool.<br/><br/> Modernised versions of Shakespeare should, in my opinion, be accessible to everyone, not just those who love Shakespeare. In retaining the original language (something that is rare in modernized Shakespeare) Luhrmann could have confused the ordinary movie-goer, but instead he fuses action and visual aid with Shakespeare's language so effectively that the audience is never confused as to the trajectory of the plot.<br/><br/> In comparison to other modernised Shakespeare films (which update or contemporise certain aspects of the original plays while retaining the Shakespearian language) this surely ranks as one of if not the best. Indeed it is difficult to recall any other films that retain the original language or text while updating certain aspects of the play. The original language is probably the biggest feature of the film that gives it a high rank, for it introduces young and old audiences unfamiliar with Shakespeare to his brilliant language while revealing how thrilling the plots of his plays actually are, by using bright and colourful settings, scenery and action. The two main roles are backed up by a brilliant cast of cameos including experienced Shakespeare actors Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino, among others.<br/><br/> This is a brilliant film which, although not one of the very greatest (The Godfather, The Usual Suspects, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption etc.) definitely deserves a rating of  8/10."

","As a director, I am thoroughly disgusted by this movie.  They're shooting each other, yet speaking English more commonly used in the 16th century? Ummm...no.  You cannot make Romeo and Juliet a contemporary film if you don't want to change the dialogue.  It seems like it would be an obvious rule, that you can't go halfway in this business, but apparently the director and screenwriter need to be reminded of this.  With Romeo and Juliet, you either have to take the IDEA of Romeo and Juliet (West Side Story is a prime example of this) and set it in the present, or make it a period piece.  You can't mix them.  I blame everyone involved with this movie.  I blame the screenwriter for writing it, the director for making it, the producer for actually spending money on it, and the actors for putting their wallets before their brains.  These people are really gonna have to redeem themselves in my book.  And you wanna know the sad part?  This movie actually made money.  Lots of it.  Forget those intelligent, witty low-budget movies that make about $5.00 at the box office.  Because its wrapped up with a shiny bow on it, this movie made a LOT of money, which to me is just pathetic.  I certainly wouldn't pay money to see it; in fact I had to force myself to watch it for free."

It showed that Romeo + Juliet were stupid teenager who thought they only had one way out. I felt there was a more human and realistic quality to the acting as well as the setting. It helped teenagers of today relate  to the story and learn from it. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are two of my favorite actors. They were even before I saw this film. I have seen it many times since its 1996 release. It is still one of my favorite versions of Romeo + Juliet. I really recommend it ; not just for the acting, but as a thrilling visual as well.

","Now before I go any further, let me point out that I am at the older end of Generation X.  But I certainly understand the MTV generation mentality and understand that this movie taps into it better than any Shakespeare film ever made.<br/><br/>But aside from that, Baz Lurhmann's vision is phenomenal.  Sure, it's loud and overblown, but it's also amazingly affecting.  I cry when I watch this movie, not because of the story, but because so much love and energy was put into the filmmaking in an attempt to reach a generation who thinks of Shakespeare as being stuffy.<br/><br/>Obviously many going into this movie expecting traditional Shakespeare are going to be sorely disappointed.  This is Shakespeare only in name.  The poetry, I'll grant you, is often lost in this movie, but to give Lurhmann credit, much of the poetry has been quoted and requoted to the point of cliche.  Now for once, R&J is not a walking cliche.<br/><br/>Also, I have to give kudos for the Oscar-nominated art direction/set design. It is eye candy from the first shot to the last.<br/><br/>And for sheer audacity, this movie has no shame (and I mean that in a good way).  Who would ever have thought that Mercutio's Queen Mab speech could actually be about ecstacy (X)?<br/><br/>So for the Generation Xers who have never experienced Romeo & Juliet in any way other than reading it in English class, WATCH this movie.  It will open your eyes to the world of Shakespeare.  To those not of Generation X, don't begrudge us the opportunity to understand Shakespeare in our own way.  It's a door opening on the world of Shakespeare, not a door closing on traditionalism."

So I knew full well what the story and dialog entailed. True, some of the younger actors have trouble bringing out the Shakespeare, and at time it can be hard to understand the dialog over the shouting and music, but it was the little things in this movie that made it so appealing to me.  Most people have caught the fact that the guns used are named ""Sword"" and ""Rapier"" and ""Longsword"" etc..., but I liked the fact that the gun design changed depending on the name of the gun. (ie. ""Sword"" is a standard 9mm, ""Dagger"" is a lightweight pistol, ""Longsword"" is quite a piece of heavy firepower...) I also liked the fact that most people in the movie had one, as most people used to have a real sword.<br/><br/>I liked the soundtrack, it added a new dimension to the emotion of the story, and I liked the use of Wagners ""Liebestod"" from Tristan and Isolde- (where Shakespeare got his story from...)<br/><br/>I liked how the pool hall was named ""the Globe"", the symbolism and imagery.

","Is it possible to re-tell the most renowned love story of the Western culture in a new and modern way? Buz Luhrmann demonstrates that it is possible, even nowadays: also, he shows how great the Bard was: using His literal verses with modern fast MTV clip style, the director put together a piece of cinema which is both highly original and dazzlingly baroque. A parallel and multi-dimensional universe is built: parallel not only to the classic literature, of which the film constitutes a blasting update, but also to the Hollywood industry, with the great choice of Mexico City as major outdoor location. Using the Di Caprio - icon when it was not yet overworked by the Titanic phenomenon, the film maker casts the best possible Romeo Montague in the Nineties, matching him with a baby faced but strongly hearted Clare Danes; with her, Di Caprio plays the best scene of the year (by the aquarium), a touching and subtle metaphor of the discovery of the ""other"", both surrounded with the mellifluous chant which is the main film song. All in all: original, with a striking incipit, a fabulous overall casting, and a generous display of great, outrageous visuals (the party, the interior of the church, the aerial shots). Definitely one of 1997 best ones, and a conspicuous 9/10!"

He hasn't changed; the material he's been offered lately is simply not up to his earlier films), Harold Perrineau Jr., Miriam Margolyes, Pete Postelthwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Sorvino (okay, I'm biased in favor of those last two).  Claire Danes, for some reason, doesn't work here; like DiCaprio, she's better than she's usually given credit for, but the usual fire is absent here.  Don't even get me started about John Leguizamo, because he is just plain ludicrous.  Tybalt is supposed to be a badass, and Leguizamo cannot even remotely carry that off.  I kept wondering why Perrineau didn't just stuff him into a locker and be done with it.<br/><br/>The movie works best when it underplays and gives the audience a chance to enjoy finely nuanced performances.

"indiegirl26","10","0","2","24 December 1999"," Garish eye-candy, revamps classic love story with style
","Shakespeare was first and foremost, an entertainer. His job was to hold the interest and attention of the violent, uneducated rabble his all-male cast performed to, and if that meant introducing copious amounts of under-age sex, blood and vengeance, well then, so be it. Sword-fights, murder, betrayal, romance, black magic, secrecy, incest and insanity all frequently featured in his productions, some of which were performed right in front of our very own Virgin Queen Elizabeth I. They were there to grab the spectators attention, and then intoxicate them into the story, dialogue, characters and their lives to create a fantasy atmosphere that would prove to be so gripping, that they could not possibly wish to escape back to ye olde tavern for a pint of warm ale. And so today, Australian director Bazmark Luhrmann, most revered for his humorous and innovative spoof on Ozzie dancers in the independent film 혩Strictly Ballroom' - and most hated for his annoying record, 혩Sunscreen', has taken Shakespeare's sixteenth century storyline and spiked its coke with acid, to inject a clearer message to our Tarantino-worshipping Generation X - whoever they are. This is Shakespeare for the masses.<br/><br/>The setting of the film, Verona Beach is presented as a big, dusty, putrid city, filled with big dreams and small salaries. An amazing kitsch, Catholic statue of the Virgin Mary towers above the city alongside the Diet Coke ads, supported by a crude barrage of scaffolding. The ocean breeze whips the sand up to create an outstanding host of gritty effects during some of the latter fight scene, and with its soundtrack containing the Butthole Surfers and Everclear, one cannot escape this imaginary world of garish colours, excessive noise pollution and fairgrounds on the beach. It's like West Side Story for the common people - which is probably why I like it. Just joking.<br/><br/>The blur of brash and exciting colour fuels the film, dizzying the audience, enveloping us in its passion, displayed through the star performances of all the members of the cast, as each actor lives their part with true and devout conviction and dedication. The script has been cut drastically, but because of Luhrmann's clever use of imagery, symbolism and innovative direction, the core of the story is never lost or even left to incorrect interpretation. The transformation of the play, from a cliched stage of cod-pieces and tin-foil swords, into a powerful piece of cinema pushes both boundaries and emotions. Mercutio appears as a drug-pushing, African-American drag-queen, with more than a slight crush on Romeo yet despite the stilettos and faux-fur pink bra, still delivers a hugely accurate and captivating portrayal of the hero's best friend. The famous siloquoy where Mercutio describes the dangerous powers of love is intimately linked with the ingestion of some white dove e, and amazingly the two merge seamlessly. The masked ball is announced by the devilishly wicked Lady Capulet via cable television, and the extravagant event itself is a brash and dazzling trip. The two fathers are presented as archetypal Sicilian dons, with a tattooed Tybalt literally stealing every single scene he appears in. There is also a helicopter chase, plenty of shoot-outs, a stall called 혩The Merchant of Venice', a mailing service known as Post. Post Haste', and Romeo's chill-out spot for introspection and smoking, the Sycamore Grove, turns out to be a derelict playhouse. This film is truly imagination working at its finest. The traditional balcony scene is transported beautifully to the Capulet's swimming pool, where Romeo, hiding in the shadows, surprises his crush, and together they hurtle into the water. This scene is fresh and witty, a continuous kiss-or-not-to-kiss. Claire Danes gives a passionate and sweet performance as Juliet, spicing up our heroine with a slice of 90s girl power, while DiCaprio is a strong and determined leading male, romantic with an element of vulnerability and adolescent awkwardness. Both are correctly portrayed as young innocents without voices, only finding themselves in eachother. Infact, Luhrmann fully exploits the sensuality and dramatic effect of water throughout the film. We first met our heroine staring face down in a basin of water, gazing languidly into the camera, stoned and angelic, her incredibly long red hair floating around and framing her pale and placcid face. Romeo is seen plunging his head into a sink of H2O following his dose of drugs, emerging with dripping wet hair, presently spying Juliet through the home of some tropical fish. The best scene provides the forum for Tybalt's murder, shot in a thunder storm, infront of the great Virgin Mary statue, where our victim hurtles back into the fountain, saturated in a heady mixture of water and his own blood. Symbolism litters this film like gold-dust at the bottom of a rainbow. Waking up beside Juliet following their illicit wedding night, scars coating his body, Romeo kisses Juliet and then prepares to leave. As she begs him to stay he grabs the bedsheets which billow over them, creating a protective white tent, before finally whipping the sheets up around them, sheltering them from the harsh daylight and the reality it inevitably brings. In fancy-dress, Romeo appears as a knight in shining armour, Tybalt as Satan, the Capulets as decadent classical characters, and Juliet as a vision-like angel. Needless to say this film is breathtaking to watch, providing a full two hours of unstoppable eye-candy. It has a fail-safe script, obviously, and an amazing soundtrack. Everyone can act in it, which is pretty rare these days, and everything fits together like lycra on an aerobics queen. A resounding full marks for the revamped Romeo and Juliet. Better than the simpering 혩Shakespeare in Love' anyday."

","Modern adaptations of Shakespeare are all the rage, of course, and they're always a big gamble - in the attempt to communicate the ""timelessness"" of Shakespeare's plays, one can wind up with something all the more dated and forgettable. This is probably along those lines, but it's not without charm.<br/><br/>I seem to be one of the few not disturbed by the present-day setting. If there was one thing this movie actually did very well, it was to effectively grasp, perhaps by accident, the emotional motif of Romeo & Juliet and place it in the present day. The decadence and schlocky absurdity of all the scenery is actually quite consistent with the feel of the play.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not sure what to make of it. Perhaps Baz Luhrmann realized that most of the actors under 30 didn't know what they were doing, and decided to distract from it with his camerawork. If you want to see Romeo & Juliet, this is most certainly not the version to see - the acting is generally horrid and the script takes some highly questionable, er, ""liberties"". But it's still an interesting little effort somehow."

","I honestly think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I know it's been panned as being an ""Mtv"" version of Shakespeare, but to that I say, so what?  I mean, yes the movie's done with a fast pace and bright colors that give it a trendy, modern feel, but it also does an amazing job of conveying all the emotions of one of the greatest plays ever written by one of the greatest playwrights who ever lived.  I've seen the much-acclaimed 1960s version, and honestly, I was bored.  I think the choice of which parts of Shakespeare's work to use was MUCH better in the 1996 version.  It seemed to me that the older one left out some of the most beautiful and poetic lines. Claire Danes is insanely talented as Juliet, and Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have been born to play the part of Romeo.  Great supporting cast too, especially Mercutio.

A movie with only the best expectations and not as good a performance. Leonardo Dicaprio let's start with, we all know he was only cast because he was a popular teen actor back in the day.  Right now, he is struggling to get back in the limelight.  Claire Danes is a good actress but her performance was lacking in this show.  Most of the other characters seemed to be miscasted, it just didn't seem like a good movie.  Some of the scenes were overdone (like the first one) and the make up and costumes were overdone (but with good old Baz, you knew it was coming) and I couldn't stand the whiney '90's music.  If you want a teen movie, and basically nothing else, I guess it would be a good choice, but be warned, there is no slapstick humor, very little nudity and a depressing ending.  Not your typical teen flick."

Some faults include excess modernization or costuming like Pete Posthlewaite's tattoo, Tybalt's ""gangsta"" like slickness and definitely Mercutio's drag outfit! That last scene and also the first are very weak and the film can occasionally be a bit awkward. However, Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent. Both have done much of their previous and future work in depressing or tragic roles and both are very convincing with their agony and emotions here. Some of the cinematography is beautifully shot, notably the kiss in the elevator and the aquarium scene. This film should also be commended for exposing teenagers or other modern movie watchers to Shakespeare and how his work is completely relevant today."

The love between Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio is quite nice, although it lacks the wild passion (particularly on Claire's part) that distinguishes this tale, and Pete Postlethwaite seems to be the only actor involves who seems as though he can truly handle the Bard. Nevertheless, I think it can only be a compliment to Shakespeare that his work continues to be interpreted in so many diverse ways hundreds of years after he wrote it.

'Romeo + Juliet' however, succeeds where others fail by making Shakespeare seem genuinely hip and cool. I thought, at first, that using the traditional Shakespearean language would make the movie seem out-dated, but the addition  of fast cars, cool clothes and an attitude you could break rocks on transforms the dialogue into slang language that comes across almost like a regional dialect.<br/><br/>True, the lead performances are weak (DiCaprio is not a convincing Romeo and I think that Danes, while acceptable, does not shine in the role) and the overwhelming examples of religious imagery (there is even a picture of the Virgin Mary on a clock face) are sometimes a little too blatant, I am pleased that someone has, at last, had the guts to pull Shakespeare kicking and screaming into the 20th Century."

Half-way through the movie I had forgotten that the language was 400 years old and I had no trouble at all understanding what was happening. Not only do the actors say the words in a way that lets you understand, but also the actors are so visual and expressive that you could almost understand the movie without any words at all. (though the words are wonderful and definitely worth keeping!) Leo and Claire were both great and were totally convincing as young people in love. Leo has gotten so much backlash after his popularity as Titanic, but he CAN act. (If you don't believe that after R+J, go watch Gilbert Grape, he's the only good part of the movie) I've watched this movie 3 times, with a period of about 3 months between each time, and every time my amazement is refreshed. In between, I slowly forget how good he (not to mention the movie) is! I don't think he's the hottest guy alive or anything like that, but I admit (with a little embarrassment!) that his talent and looks combined in this movie make him very attractive. Claire Danes is awesome too, her role in this made her one of my favorite female actors. The scene when Romeo and Juliet first meet is one of the best in the movie. You can almost see the electricity between them! The other actors were all good too. John Leguizamo is very convincing, the Friar and Nurse were good and Mercutio is a fun, likable character. Oh yes, some people complain about the ""MTV"" likeness and the music. I wouldn't know about MTV, because I never watch it, but I think the music was very good. I especially loved the boy's choir song in the wedding scene. And of course the tragic end scene....That was lovely. It's the scene I dislike the most (besides the Romeo murdering Tybalt scene, that's just scary) because of what happens, but it is also very great acting. My friends (who I watched it with) and I kept telling Romeo not to drink the poison, Juliet wasn't dead, but of course he does it every time! I love all the candles around in this scene, that's was a wonderful touch. I think that's all I'll say, except I must mention that I don't think Shakespeare would be turning over in his grave.

Branagh's Henry V is brilliant theater, but I do not think it works as a movie.<br/><br/>In this film they have kept the respect for the old master in adopting the dialogue to modern american.

I was reminded of Danes and DiCaprio, who knew what they were doing, and made every scene that they had together work very well.  Unfortunately, they eventually got sunk by the actors surrounding them, whose idea of emotional Shakespeare is to scream their lines as loudly as possible.<br/><br/>It's almost a shame that Miriam Margoyles (Juliet's Nurse) and Pete Postlethwaite (The Friar) are in this movie; they remind us what good Shakespeare is supposed to sound like.  And their all-too-brief scenes raise the bar for the rest of the actors, who, unfortunately, fall very short.<br/><br/>It's not the direction or attempts at modernization which eventually sinks this movie, but instead the lack of support for Danes, DiCaprio, Margoyles, and Postlethwaite, which lowers Lurhmann's production to the level of a High School play.

","Baz Luhrmann is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen.  He goes past what everyone will think and does his own thing.  An example would be his spectacular musical, ""Moulin Rouge!""  He did everything his way and it turned out to be something I truly enjoy.  That's why it's up for the second most amount of Oscars tied with, ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Now with Romeo and Juliet, Baz Luhrmann does an interesting twist.  He exchanges the older setting for a modernized one.  Many, I have heard did not appreciate this and probably did not believe that it should ever be done.  However, Baz kept the language and proved a fact I have recently learned.  My English teacher told my class that, ""Times change, but people don't.""  That is demonstrated here in this film, the time changed, but the people did not.  They shared the same hate, the same love, the same tragedy.  Baz Luhrmann connected with a younger audience because I first saw this when I was 10 years old and somehow followed the story.  I hadn't ever read Romeo and Juliet, but that movie gave me this craving to learn about it.  So I waited to read it in school so I could learn what it meant and now I am.  The movie was different, but it still showed me how Shakespeare's plays have stayed alive through all these years, and it also showed me that times do change, but people do not.  It should not matter what way this was filmed or wasn't. Shakespeare borrowed a story told over time and made it his own.  He made it the way he wanted it, and everyone does the same when they borrow something. They make it their own, just as Baz Luhrmann did.   And people can personally hate it, but they should at least respect it.  I personally believe that this was a great retelling of the classic play and now that I am reading Shakespeare's version, I am understanding more and more of the movie.  To me, this was one in a million, and no one else could have pulled it off as great as he did."

Set in modern times (in fictional Verona Beach, California), with gun-toting, car-driving characters, the characters speak perfect Shakespearean English, complete with the ""thee""'s and ""wherefore""'s of the 15th century. Ludicrous? I thought it would be--and yet it works. The acting and cinematography hy is so first-rate it's not hard to suspend disbelief and believe that all this actually happened--and in precisely this way. It was a surrealistic experience, like being caught in some bizarre time warp in another dimension where somehow the 20th century happened--but the English language never evolved. And of course, the story of the star-crossed lovers is timeless...it could happen in any century. Perhaps this is the message the filmmakers were trying to get across. Dicaprio is good here as Romeo, but it's Claire Danes who really shines. She's delicately and ethereally beautiful as Juliet, but with just the right amount of playful innocence to make her accessible. A fresh and original take on a very old story, but the 1968 version is still my favorite adaptation."

I absolutely LOVED it, to say the least. Despite the fact that I really didn't know what was happening most of the time, I found it thoroughly entertaining.  Since then, I've seen it about six times.<br/><br/>This last school year, in ninth grade, we read and studied the play in my english class.  We went through slowly, studying the meaning of nearly everything written in the script.  The ideas, drama and sheer beauty of the poetry became so much clearer once I understood what was happening.  I watched it again, with the same friends from before on another weekend vacation, and loved the movie even more.  Being able to understand the poetry enhances the experience of this wonderful movie. My english teacher showed us two versions of Romeo and Juliet-the version directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and this one.  He personally liked the second version, Baz Luhrmann's, more...the ending, he said, was more ""heart-wrenching.""  And how true that is!  Every time I watch this movie I find myself hoping and hoping that maybe this time it's different, and Juliet will wake up.  It always brings a tear to my eye, however sappy that sounds.<br/><br/>I also greatly enjoyed the soundtrack...it fitted perfectly and added so much to the story.<br/><br/>As far as the film's faults go, I see very few.  Reading other people's reviews, I noticed that many found the acting by DiCaprio and Danes flat and poorly done.  I myself am not a connoisseur of Shakespearean acting, so I have little to compare it to; however, I found the acting convincing and moving.  I am not particularly a DiCaprio fan, but I thought he did very well portraying Romeo, and likewise with Danes.<br/><br/>I recommend reading either the original play or at least an interpretation of it before seeing the movie.

","When I write a comment, I first usually tell a short outline of the plot. I don´t think that´s necessary here. Everybody knows the famous Shakespeare novel (I hope so...), and it must have been adapted for the big screen at least a hundred times. Nevertheless Baz Luhrmann´s (""Strictly ballroom"") version of ""Romeo & Juliet"" is a special one. Just imagine Shakespeare would have met Tarantino...<br/><br/>In this modern version, the story is settled in the 90´s. The Montague´s and Capulet´s are two mafia clans that live in emnity. Leonardo di Caprio and Claire Danes are their kids who unallowedly fall in love with each other. I couldn´t imagine a better cast for the most famous couple in the world. Once again, ""chemistry"" is the magic word. You could think they´re real couple of these days.  That´s why - in my eyes - the tragic dimension of the story gets so truthful. By the way, Natalie Portman was first planned for the role of Juliet, but she seemed too young for it. But that´s another story...<br/><br/>Of course, the novel wasn´t adapted in the original length. I suppose the only Shakespeare novel, where this fact is applicable, is Kenneth Brannagh´s version of ""Hamlet"" (1996). But the dialogues were putted into verses, and that´s just magic! In this way, Luhrmann spans a several centuries. Fascinating, isn´t it?

Lurhmann knows this, he also knows that this is Shakespeare, and while it's certainly genius of the highest order, most stupid and ignorant teenagers won't understand Shakespearan speech, so he knows he has to hook you in the beginning till you grow to know and accept it for what it is.

","I think that the 1996 version of Romeo and Juliet turned out very good considering that it is almost a 90 degree turn on Shakespeare's original version. The Miami Beach setting gave the play something that worked well for most viewers; however, the use of Shakespeare's Elizabethan poetry was a little hard to follow for most, especially if they had never read the original play. I also liked how Baz Luhrmann employed the use of modern archetypes for the characters. They not only helped audience members understand the personalities of the characters but they also fit well into the movie. Although I enjoyed the movie on a whole, I believe that some scenes should have remained unaltered in a sense. For instance, when Romeo and Juliet pledge their love for each other. Traditionally this scene has taken place with Juliet on the balcony and Romeo below. In this version Luhrmann had them exchange their love in a swimming pool. Although this is a nice touch, I think that the balcony represented the division of their love by their families hatred for each other. Even though I thought that some things worked better than others, overall I think that Shakespeare's debut in the 90's was a success."

A few tears were shed at that moment.<br/><br/>Overall I give it 7.5 out of 10."

","Quite simply brilliant and unmissable - a feast for the eyes and the ears with Di Caprio and Danes being the definitive star crossed lovers. Even the most die hard Shakespeare hater will be won over by this epic. It makes you wonder what director Baz Luhrmann will come up with next!!!! Don't be put off by all the MTV comparisons - I never ever watch MTV and LOVED this."

","While a much bigger-budget and more ""serious"" work, this isn't really nearly as good as Luhrmann's earlier _Strictly Ballroom_.<br/><br/>This wildly experimental movie is, overall, a dismal (albeit instructive) failure. The plot narrative arc runs parallel to _Strictly Ballroom_, beginning in a much wilder, freer, more experimental style early in the picture, shifting gradually over to a more conventional mode of storytelling about a quarter of the way in. As with the earlier picture, I wonder if the real reason for the switch is not that Luhrmann simply ran out of steam and energy for the frenetic editing.<br/><br/>The biggest failing is in the casting. While both exceptionally pretty, neither Danes nor diCaprio ever come to grips with the meaning in their lines -- falling victim to the most common failing when doing Shakespeare, they never manage to forget that the lines are supposed to be POETRY. Several supporting players, most notably Harold Perrineau as Mercutio and John Leguizamo as Tybalt, overcome this problem with ease. Perrineau in particular is flatly amazing, easily stealing every scene; that's not hard with material like Mercutio, but as so often happens with this play, a good Mercutio serves no end so much as to show up the weaknesses of the story in general (to wit, these are all a bunch of witless adolescents that most of us wouldn't give a thought to outside of The Theatre).<br/><br/>Good eye candy, and some really fine performances (although none from the principles)."

","I thought this was such an amazing film, I was blown away with the mise-en-scene, the quality and soundtrack. DiCaprio plays a great role of Romeo and the cast are brilliantly chosen.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film to anyone who loves a bit of tragic drama in their lives."
"ad2020","6","0","1","23 November 2000"," Why did Baz call this ""William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet""?
","Using this title in it's own right thumbs it's nose at the Bard!! Not that I'm a true member or anything, but pretension is going to have reaction's, most of which are going to be negative!!!! I haven't seen this flick for a while, but I do remember that everybody I associated with at the time absolutely despised it. I can see why, Shakespeare was a poet before a playwrite to my knowledge (don't hold me to it, I prefer his works to his life story!) so any well crafted dialogue of his is butchered for physical and visual effect in this movie, it's just wrong! Not to mention I find the acting to be thrown out for speed,and you can't just do what you please w/ the physical aspects of the original play, so many scenes that made the play a fatalistical tragedy are overwrought!! I have to give this movie it's due, though, it shows a great use of visual ability that should be used w/ these types of stories (even though it seems that Baz is trying to do everything that everybody else didn't with this movie) which does justice to the themes of this play. I'm not familiar with any of Baz Luhrmann's other work's, but after graduating to his sappy ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"", I'll be concise enough to say this is his best work (which definitely ain't saying a lot!) and that I'm afraid to meet him for fear of laughing at him or puking on him! A 5.5"
