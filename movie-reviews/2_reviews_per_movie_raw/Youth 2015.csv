","I'm not a professional in film reviews, to begin with. I'm just an University student who's got an enormous passion for cinema. It was years since a movie moved my soul in such a profound way. I was stunned when I saw that the movie summed up a 7.5 rating here on IMDb. I thought about this fact for some days, then I kind of make up my answer. ""Youth"" is the symbol of many struggles in cinema and in people's mind. American movies and many Europeans ones as well are so easy to like, just because they're easy to follow. They show facts, actions, somehow explained by words and some ideas. Ideas are like the salt we put on on our meals to make them tasty. Films like ""Youth"" are the exact opposite: words and ideas are the ""meal"", and a few actions are the ""salt"". Actually all the actions are at the end of the movie, they could be perceived as a climax, but they're more like the conclusion of complex exchanges of ideas throughout the movie. I won't comment about technical features, because I don't have the expertise to do it. I just say that the soundtrack is somewhere near perfection, editing as well and there some beautifully shot scenes. As I said, my concern is not about that. ""Youth"" make the viewer think about life, old age, ethics, it accompanies us through some beautiful ideas, and this is where all pros and cons stay. This movie doesn't look for easy ways to impress the viewer, to make him/her somehow forcefully interested to what the screen shows, it requests an open mind and what I ironically call ""the 51st shade"": a fetish to thoughts, not only to material things. Some people don't like Sorrentino because they consider him a ""radical chic intellectual"". It is a righteous choice to be against ""intellectualism"" whatsoever, but it is as well righteous to be against ignorance."

","Greetings again from the darkness. With a Best Foreign Language Oscar for his previous film The Great Beauty (La grande bellezza), expectations were sky high for this one from writer/director Paolo Sorrentino. Cinematographer Luca Bigazzi is also back and the two create yet another artistic entrée that is a visual extravaganza, worthy of the admission price even if no dialogue existed. Combine the visual artistry with a commentary on age and emotions, and the result is a film that will either enchant or stultify  with probably no middle ground.<br/><br/>Michael Caine stars as Fred Ballinger, a renowned Orchestra conductor, who is vacationing at a stunning Swiss Alps spa with his daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) and his long-time best friend, screenwriter Mick Boyd (Harvey Keitel). Fred, a self-professed retiree, is being pursued by Queen Elizabeth's representative to perform one last concert. Fred is adamant in his refusal  for personal reasons we later learn are due to his nostalgic belief that his wife (no longer able to sing) is the only one who will sing his ""simple"" songs as long as he is alive. In the meantime, Mick is working with a group of ambitious young writers in an attempt to leave a legacy with his most important film ever. So you can already see that both men are working through their golden years in different ways.<br/><br/>Lena is devastated when her husband dumps her for a young pop singer (played by the real pop singer, Paloma Faith). Oh, one other detail  Lena's husband is also Mick's son (Ed Stoppard). This makes for some awkward (but entertaining) moments, and also leads to one of the film's best scenes – Lena spilling her emotional guts to Fred while they are both covered in a mud bath. Director Sorrentino is a master at twisting these poignant moments with dashes of levity or irony. Another example is when Miss Universe (Romanian model Madalina Diana Ghenea) puts a condescending movie actor (Paul Dano) in his place with a devastating shift in tone and a comeback for the ages.<br/><br/>Sorrentino executes a couple of bizarre dream or fantasy sequences – one with Fred conducting a cow pasture (replete with cows and other bits of nature), and another with Mick being haunted in a meadow by all the female stars from his films (each in costume of their character). Suffice to say, this is not a conventional look at aging. What's also clear is that Sorrentino believes our emotions drive our actions. The most jarring example is the aftermath when Mick's long-time leading lady Brenda Morel (played by Jane Fonda) declines to appear in his latest film.<br/><br/>Even the most bizarre segments are presented with a visual artistry that forces our brains to process overtime. How about an obese Diego Maradona (played by Roly Serrano) repeatedly kicking tennis balls into the air? Or big time actor Jimmy Tree (Dano) struggling with his decision to sellout by appearing in a popular robot movie instead of pursuing his desire to be taken seriously as an actor? Or Lena bouncing back with a socially awkward mountain man? Or the seemingly minor role of a young masseuse (played by Luna Zimic Mijovic) who has us yearning for more? In addition to how each of these segments is startling to look at, Jane Fonda's role has so many nuances that an entire movie could be made about her.<br/><br/>As with The Great Beauty, the film will have the most profound impact on those of us old enough to be looking through the binoculars and noticing how far away the past looks  and wondering just how long until ""Life's Last Day""."

","Once again, Paolo Sorrentino proves to be a master of cinema and doesn't disappoint. The story is set in an apparently isolated place: a luxury hotel in the mountains of Switzerland inhabited mainly by artists and people from the show business (curious the reference to Maradona, thanked by Sorrentino during his Oscar acceptance speech).<br/><br/>Youth is a tender film in both the characters and the themes: growing old and the fears related to it are common to all men. Fred (Michael Caine) is an old man who still has a lot going on in his life: he has to deal with friendship, love, family and his career. The only thing that makes him different from the younger people surrounding him is that he is aware of memory. It is through memory that he has lost and that he tries to regain his identity. Everyone in the film is in search for identity: the contrast between how people see them and what they want to be seen as.<br/><br/>The screenplay is complex and intense and for this reason sometimes hard to follow. I loved the irony Sorrentino always puts in his movies: through surrealism he is capable of expressing humanity in a simple but yet beautiful way. All the cast delivers great performances and cinematography is absorbing as always. Sorrentino is a director of places: no matter if it is the Eternal City of Rome or an hotel immersed in nature - he is able to capture all the beauty of it.<br/><br/>What the film teaches us, in the end, is that we are what we do - so, I'd add, it's better if we do what we are - but we are nothing without love, which is the driving force of humanity."

","When it comes to Paolo Sorrentino I don't know what to expect. On one hand I loved his first English work ""This Must Be The Place"" starring a wonderful Sean Penn; on the other hand I didn't quite enjoy his Oscar Winner ""The Great Beauty"". I was actually afraid this one was going to be another attempt at being Fellini. But Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Paul Dano and Rachel Weisz gave me the push to watch it. I'm glad I didn't wait, because this is Sorrentino's greatest beauty.<br/><br/>Youth is a brilliant, intense, philosophical, and moving film about life and death, youth and oldness, loneliness and friendship.<br/><br/>As I watched the film I thought the title was deceiving. I thought it was only about being old, and I couldn't find the real meaning of it. But as I'm writing this, has passed almost a week since I saw it, and I've got enough time to think about it. Now, I do realize it is about the importance of youth, because it praises old age as that moment in life when you think about your past.<br/><br/>Masterfully directed and written by Paolo Sorrentino, the film is enhanced by a deep, witty, and provocative dialogue, a wonderful and breathtaking photography by Luca Bigazzi, spectacular scenography, and sublime music.<br/><br/>The acting is first class. Michael Caine shines in the leading role, delivering an intense performance as Fred Ballinger. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well. Old, but young inside Harvey Keitel, and young, but old inside Paul Dano are perfect in portraying the contrast between youth and oldness. Rachel Weisz delivers another great performance. Jane Fonda's cameo is great too. The one that surprised me the most is Luna Zimic Mijovic, who plays the masseuse.<br/><br/>Read more at afilmadaybysonia.blogspot.com"

","* The parade of weird characters in the Alpine luxury resort where the entire film is set - from an obese football player with a tattoo of Karl Marx on his back to a masseuse with braces who declares she likes touching more than talking, and imitates dancing cartoon characters in her spare time. <br/><br/>* The way Jane Fonda's character is introduced - initially filmed from the back, then showing her smile in the reflection of a mirror, and finally facing the camera, radiating maximum diva charisma. <br/><br/>* The abundance of funny dialogue. Here's just one example: - 'Im great in bed'. - 'I know' - 'How do you know?' - 'Because you're my daughter'. <br/><br/>* The lush cinematography, making the film a feast for the eyes. <br/><br/>* The fact that this film is funny, dramatic and melancholic at the same time, and also surprising, entertaining, beautiful, philosophical and versatile. <br/><br/>* Michael Caine, at 82, playing one of the best parts of his career. <br/><br/>* The completely over-the-top video clip by Paloma Faith, which is integrated in the film as a dream sequence. <br/><br/>* The end of the dramatic conversation between Jane Fonda and Harvey Keitel, with both faces filmed sideways in close-up, on both sides of the screen, and finally Fonda's hand on Keitel's cheek. <br/><br/>* The overall sense of watching an extraordinary film."

","Reviewers Notes, humbly submitted: <br/><br/>1. One of those must-see films that contains images, performances, set pieces and snippets of dialog that will haunt you long after you have left the theatre. My favorite is a throwaway line by Harvey Keitel's character casually explaining why for 60 years he has been gullible in his relationship with Caine's character: ""I invent stories ... I have to believe everything in order to make things up."" (Keitel) That is what reviewers like to call dialog within dialog.<br/><br/>2. Caine is superb, but then again he is always superb.<br/><br/>3. This is an affectation that this reviewer wants to add: since Sorrentino is very direct about wanting this film to be about age, the experience would be enhanced if you watch 1966's Alfie before seeing Youth. To see Caine (at the time) portraying one of the sexiest men alive will take you to a new level of appreciation for what age is about.<br/><br/>4. Some of the images, clearly surreal, could well set the standard for the medium for years to come. They are not only extraordinary but plentiful. Contrast these for example to TV's American Horror Story which pretends to be leading edge in this regard but in fact is merely recycling stuff from 1970s horror films. This is the real deal.<br/><br/>5. Weisz comes full circle. She started her career doing serious roles in indies, temporarily became a saucy sex goddess, and is now a serious actress once again.<br/><br/>6. Only criticism is a problem I have noticed with other films by strong directors like Woody Allen -- the director, doing double duty as the writer, is virtually God in this production and subconsciously the viewer understands that he or she may as well be watching a film made on Mars, because the energy and the characters are so far removed from reality."
"murtaza_mma","8","37","56","15 November 2015"," One of the best films of the year
","There is a sense of nostalgia in the films of Paolo Sorrentino. The nostalgia often comes across as a sense of regret for the loss of innocent love experienced by the central characters during their youth. Such a regret can easily fills one's heart with melancholy but Sorrentino seems to have mastered the art of mixing gravity with levity. His films can be both serious and farcical at the same time and that's why they are more complex than what they prima facie appear. Youth‬ is no different.<br/><br/>Here is a film about larger-than-life oldies pining for their long past golden years of youth. We have a retired conductor (Michael Caine), a self-indulgent filmmaker well past his prime (Harvey Keitel), an insecure actor (Paul Dano), a mountaineer, a Miss Universe with brains, and an overweight footballer (most probably based on Maradona). There is a lively cameo from Jane Fonda who plays a legendary actress from Hollywood and then there is Rachel Weisz who plays the conductor's daughter.<br/><br/>Among other things (which certainly include Sorrentino's brilliant direction), it is the performances of Caine and Keitel that makes it a treat to watch. While Keitel steals every scene that he is a part of, Caine delivers a deeply nuanced performance around which the entire movie revolves. Youth is nowhere near being Sorrentino's best but it is certainly one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges""."

This isn't merely a story that needs to be seen, but it also demands to be felt.<br/><br/>'Youth' Synopsis: A retired orchestra conductor is on holiday with his daughter and his film director best friend in the Alps when he receives an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II to perform for Prince Philip's birthday.<br/><br/>'Youth' is flawless work. Sorrentino's Screenplay is about the eternal struggle between age and youth, the past and the future, life and death, commitment and betrayal. And its all depicted so seamlessly. I was truly blown away. Watching the protagonist & co. explore each other lives as their come under roof, is often saddening, but its so so affecting, as well. The Screenplay flows bravely & the pace remains tight.<br/><br/>Sorrentino's Direction is extraordinary. He's outdone himself here, delivering a story that deals with life & its consequences. Luca Bigazzi's Cinematography is a visual delight. Each & Every Frame has captured the sheer beauty of the nature on display. Editing is crisp. David Lang's Score is incredible. Art & Costume Design are elegant.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Sir Michael Caine is at his aging best. Its a masterclass, masterful performance, from this legendary actor! Harvey Keitel is in top-form, complimenting Caine & holding on his own, throughout. Rachel Weisz is magnificent. An Oscar should chase her next year. And The Terrific Paul Dano continues to astonish. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Youth' cannot be missed. Two Big Thumbs Up!"

","Gaspingly pretentious portrait of characters at a resort hotel and spa in the Swiss Alps. Michael Caine is a British widower and retired symphony conductor--an annual guest at the spa for some 20 years--who refuses a request from an emissary of the Queen of England to conduct again for Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Caine's grown daughter is temporarily staying with him; she's distraught over her recent breakup with the son of another guest, screenwriter Harvey Keitel, an exercise-friend of Caine's who commiserates with him over their combined years and non-working body parts. Other guests include a rock-climbing instructor, a film actor, assorted child prodigies, a beauty contest winner, et al. Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino has a grandiose visual concept, which he makes clear within the film's first 10 minutes; however, his artistically-composed shots of naked, sagging bodies (usually slumped over in states of depression, inert in the steam rooms or floating aimlessly in the swimming pools) are not especially pointed or amusing. The shots call attention themselves, probably to distract the viewer from the lack of substance in the writing (or interest in the central characters). Caine, pinkish-white like a rabbit, seems to look out at the world with bleary eyes--but is this the character or simply the actor in bad physical shape? Keitel doesn't appear very spry either, but the worst is saved for Jane Fonda (in a bad blonde wig) as a jaded, foulmouthed actress just in from Los Angeles (she asks Keitel expository questions to set the scene: ""How long have we known each other, Mick?""). ""Youth"" flatlines at the one-hour mark--with another 63 minutes on the clock. * from ****"
"nelsonrowe","2","97","178","21 October 2015"," Disappointment
","Youth is the sort of film we are supposed to like: esteemed Italian director and Academy Award winner, venerable actors, weighty subject matter. Yet, in the end it is one big disappointment. Here is why, and beware the spoilers.<br/><br/>1. The female characters are portrayed as weak, infantile or voiceless. Rachel Weisz has, by her own account, two jobs: daughter and assistant to her father the famous composer (which make it one job). Unable to pursue her own life, she is also afraid of heights. Although she confronts her father about his failings, we last see her being held like a baby by the bland mountaineer while hanging from the side of a mountain. Jane Fonda, in a brief cameo, berates Harvey Keitel while claiming she made her own career. Yet she is reduced to a raving mess on an airplane after learning of his suicide. The quiet masseuse, when asked why she never speaks, replies that she has nothing to say. Caine's wife is portrayed in just one scene, and she is reduced to nothing more than a catatonic silent scream.<br/><br/>2. Auxiliary characters such as the violin boy and the girl in the store do not emerge organically from the story. Rather they seem to be dropped into the story to mouth the thoughts of the writer/director, who apparently wants to make sure that the audience doesn't miss his intent.<br/><br/>3. The film is over filled with one surrealistic trope after another to the point of bursting.<br/><br/>4. Michael Caine's character is wrought over the realization late in life that devoting his time to his art/work came at the expense of relationships with people who mattered, namely his wife and daughter. Harvey Keitel, seeking to find a continued purpose in life by writing a new screenplay, kills himself upon realizing he can't do it. This is the stuff of a college sophomore who has taken a course in existential philosophy and became fascinated by The Stranger. There is a surface level philosophical question, but not much depth to it.<br/><br/>5. I could go on about the portrayal of emotionally empty sex, dining rooms filled with mute couples and mannequin like guests, people marching like automatons to the spa and so forth, all of which leave the viewer with a dismal view of life.<br/><br/>I give credit to Caine, Keitel and Weisz for doing the best they could with marginal material. The film itself, however, is pretty to look at and dismal to watch."
"scottmontreal-94296","5","16","24","15 January 2016"," A vacuous film about the upper class that would make Fellini cringe
","There are three main film elements here that run in different directions.<br/><br/>1. The characters were the wealthy elites in an exclusive resort without everyday cares that us plebes in the audience have. No sir, their concerns are maintaining great art as an octogenarian, or gossiping about other lives. <br/><br/>Michael Cain is a superb actor, and he can do class characters, but every time you think the film is going to mock its bourgeois characters, it glides along on gilded slippers to the next serious scene.<br/><br/>The sexism was par for the course of a male written/directed film - the women characters were weak. Although Jane Fonda did not take any prisoners, and 'Miss Universe' was stunning, naked or not.<br/><br/>Harvey Keitel's character was a film director/writer unable to write a good movie, which seemed meta as the director/writer of Youth wasn't able to overcome the same problem.<br/><br/>2. The cinematography was technically excellent, and a mash between high fashion and MTV. It screamed ART! Some scenes were trying to look like Fellini, without his flair or humor.<br/><br/>3. The dialogue was sometimes pithy and erudite, but too often it was wannabe-philosophical drivel. I think it is a class problem. How can a writer deliver the meaning of life, when his characters are the wealthy elite and his aesthetics fly first class? My partner and I laughed at the dialogue occasionally because it was so gag-worthy.<br/><br/>What I did like was the choppy scenes/editing that didn't flow with one another and even the bad surreal sequences. That gave the movie some avant-garde punch.<br/><br/>Two scenes were excellent - one were Michael Cain conducts a symphony with the cows - it was magical and unfortunately, too short; and (Spoiler Alert) the last scene where he conducts a real orchestra with superb singer Sumi Jo. Wow."
"miesnekawalki","2","18","28","16 December 2015"," Masterpiece of crap
","Youth is 'an artsy movie'. This means that it has all artsy movie clichés, as follows: no structure (just a bunch of random scenes glued together with a duct tape), no characters (talking mannequins put in random places), no plot, no joy, no substance. It's just sad and insanely boring set of shots that vary from mildly annoying to flat out disgusting.<br/><br/>Apparently it was supposed to be a study of aging. The movie presents a bunch of 'secondary characters' (young aspiring filmmakers, conductor's daughter, miss universe with disgusting silicon tits, queen's emissary, some young actor, a freaking buddhist monk) and it throws this interesting pack into beautiful hotel located in Alps to sit and talk about life and death. The main characters are 2 old farts. One grumpy ex - orchestra conductor and second retiring filmmaker. One is old and bitter and he doesn't want to perform anymore, because of some personal tragedy, the second is still kicking, but he eventually gives up too after one of his muses resigns from being in his last movie and the guy jumps off the balcony and I was supposed to care, but I didn't, because this movie was so disgusting and boring that I almost fell asleep halfway through it...<br/><br/>I wouldn't be so negative if there was some artism included in this piece. But no, all we see are metaphores served with the subtlety of Mike Tyson knocking down his opponent, 80 years old penises, silicon breasts, old people in the pool, Hitler and jokes about urinating repeated 10 times throuought the movie.<br/><br/>Boring, low impact piece of crap."

Sign of the times, but don't waste your hard earned money going to watch this...rather, go sit on a park bench and watch snippets of the world, it'll be more interesting and free to boot.

","Poor characters, cliché story, terrible dialogue. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my good time.<br/><br/>I guess cinema fans find it really hard to not like Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel, especially when they are this old and look very wise, sagelike. <br/><br/>I guess everybody has a similar expectancy when it is a movie about old age and youth and life... it has to have some wisdom. And the film tries to fulfill this, poorly. It is full of one-phrase self- help wisdom more apt for twitter than for a work of art. Dialogues like: ""when you are young everything seems so close (looking through the telescope) that is the future... when you are old everything seems far (looking through the other side of the telescope) that is the past..."" <br/><br/>It doesn't even make any sense. And the movie is full of this. Most of the dialogue is either that or just pure nonsense. Sounds very wise at first and when you think about it a minute it's total bull.<br/><br/>Yes Michael Caine can make a scene come alive, but there is no real character development apart from some very worn clichés like the unattached musician who can't relate to the world (I do music because music doesn't need words, just emotions, I don't understand the world, I understand music) And there is no development to his desicions he makes and the changes he goes through. But after all he is an actor and doesn't make a difference how good is and actor if the story is a non-story.<br/><br/>And all the supporting characters... they don't support the story. There is Maradona (obviously) staying at the hotel and he has quite long scenes. I don't see what he has to do with anything. But even the more complex characters like the movie star staying at the hotel, doesn't support the story. Just comes in, blurts out some self-help wisdom and goes out. Same as the ""miss universe"" that comes in saying ""she loves robot movies"" and turns into a psychoanalyst in 20 seconds and blurts out some more self-help and out she goes only to come back to expose her entire body naked some minutes later.<br/><br/>I actually thought of giving it a 4 out of 10 just out of respect for the very good acting... but then again, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except to give an example of bad dialogue writing and still it would be a waste of time."

","1. Some outstanding actors (including two of my favorites in Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel) being completely wasted on an indulgent, pretentious, artsy-fartsy script/story line. A solid performance by Michael Caine etc. does not save this film from being a disaster.<br/><br/>2. Extremely self indulgent and pretentious direction. All about the director showing us how clever he thinks he is. A sad case of ""look at me, look at me, aren't I so clever"" as he uses ever trick in the artsy film director's book of tricks.<br/><br/>3. To a large extent, no real plot, just too many rambling irrelevant scenes running in to each other. I kept waiting for something to happen, to involve the viewer, it did not happen. Boring, boring, boring!<br/><br/>4. Some wonderful cinematography wasted on meaningless scenes. Unfortunately, the film includes a large number of wonderful camera shots and marvelous scenery that just don't mean a thing in terms of the supposed point the director thinks he is making. Again they are in there to say ""look at me, look at me, aren't I so clever"" to make you think they must be so meaningful. Again wasted talent.<br/><br/>5. A movie perhaps made subconsciously by the director pandering to his own ego and to please the people in the circles that he moves in and the Film Critics, who could not wait to jump on to this director's bandwagon. Budget: US$13,000,000 (estimated). Gross: $1,650,314 (USA) (1 January 2016). Unlike the film industry critics, the general moving-going public was not taken in by this example of film making made for the sake of film making.<br/><br/>6. The meaningless ""parade of weird characters in the Alpine luxury resort where the entire film is set - from an obese football player with a tattoo of Karl Marx on his back to a masseuse with braces who declares she likes touching more than talking, and imitates dancing cartoon characters in her spare time"" (This quote taken from another IMDb member). It's so way out there so it must be great cinema, right? Wrong! Pretentious self-indulgence. <br/><br/>7. It tries so hard to be ""film art"" that this gets in the way of making a film for an audience to enjoy and become involved with. This movie is so focused on being different and unique, but there's a difference from being different and making art and being different and making a load of meaningless garbage.<br/><br/>8. As another IMDb member has already noted, ""The film is over filled with one surrealistic trope after another to the point of bursting."" I could not agree more.<br/><br/>9. So much of the dialogue is to a great extent meaningless and rambles on and on. <br/><br/>10. Stringing together cliché after cliché about old age and life is no way to make a good film, it all simply ends up as a huge cinematic mess.<br/><br/>I appreciate that all of these views are my subjective opinion and there is no absolute right or wrong when it comes to film and the arts, and so my aim is not to criticize others who take a different view.<br/><br/>I simply write this comment in the hope that anyone looking for an enjoyable, interesting, involving and meaningful movie will be saved from wasting two hours of their lifetime that they will never get back. I regret being put through what turned out to be for me, two hours of nauseating torture.<br/><br/>Virtually any other movie you may be considering to watch would be a better choice than this dreary, self-indulgent and pretentious waste of time, money, talent and effort.<br/><br/>If I could give this film a rating lower than 1 (awful) I would do so."

I do not understand how it has a rating as high as it is, Of course as a small art film, it has probably had a certain type of self indulgent audience, who see what is not there.

A lot of scenes are like still life paintings brought to screen, although humans are the part of the scenery.<br/><br/>Eventually, what was supposed to enhance the atmosphere turned to be the biggest weak spot. The ""important"" scenes dragged on forever and made me cherish the dialogue between the cast.<br/><br/>Youth is not a bad movie in itself. It simply shows what is considered to be a good art-house movie of today. Essentially it has a lot in common with blockbusters, boasts with stellar cast and impressive cinematography. It lacks the action and substitutes it with emotional tension between the protagonists. And the authors where pretentious as if they were paid by the minute of the final product.<br/><br/>It remains a mystery to me how this empty shell of a film became an instant classic on IMDb and would presumably become a cult movie in the time to come."

","I'm not a theatrical luvvie and I won't waste many words on this review, it's just not worth it. Total garbage, absolute rubbish, a complete waste of two hours. I'm just surprised that someone of the calibre of Michael Caine would want to get involved in this type of film. I've just done a preview of what I want to put into the review and it appears I have to write at least ten lines of text, which is going to be difficult because a few hours after watching this film most of what occurred has simply been eradicated from my memory. All I can remember about it is a series of disjointed, seemingly unconnected scenes with nothing at all to link them. I first thought with a powerful cast list that it was bound to be an enjoyable film which just proves how wrong anyone can be. As I stated, most of this film has already gone into my memory dustbin, the only things I can remember about it is some of the visual scenes that are quite well done. anyway I hope I've waffled on enough to fill ten lines of text and I wish you all the best."

","This is not a good film, but a first-rate lesson about the nature of film making.<br/><br/>When you start out, you have no equipment, no funds, no stars, no technology, no clue, but hopefully a good story.<br/><br/>Many years later, when you've come up in the world, you're shooting a scene with Sir Michael Caine in a plush mountain resort which you and your crew are occupying for months on end. You have set expert designers, cameramen, sound people, beautiful extras, the works.<br/><br/>You might feel like you're on top of your game. But when you don't have a great script, with a good story and dialogue, all the great set designers in the world, and not even Sir Michael Caine, won't be able to stop the movie from going down the drain.<br/><br/>Because making a movie is not much more than telling a two-minute fireside story with a lot of ballast.<br/><br/>I watched this movie because of the witty photo with SMC (Sir Michael Caine) and Harvey Keitel ogling a babe at a swimming pool. Unfortunately, that turned out to be the only appealing aspect of this movie."

","I cannot remember seeing a film as bad and overlong as this one. Utterly banal dialogue revealed the total lack of anything remotely intelligent. It was like a complete amateur trying to emulate the professionalism of a Fellini and failing miserably. Being in my seventies it did not remotely relate to any of the realities of old age. There were crude and unnecessary sex and nudity scenes together with characters who seemed to have no relevance to any plot if indeed there was a plot. The casting of someone as an emissary of the Queen was utterly ludicrous. The music was generally lousy and perhaps the films only redeeming feature was a scene of some cows with cowbells making music and appearing more intelligent than anybody else in the film. What a waste of two hours."

","I'm trying to think how I'm going to generate 10 lines about this spectacularly terrible film - certainly one of the worst I've ever seen. The only way this can have been financed is by its inclusion of two ""bankable"" stars - Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine. However what it was that attracted them to the script beats me. Nonetheless they manage - Michael Caine in particular - to give what must surely be the least convincing performances of their careers. Which is hardly surprising considering the portentous drivel that they have to spout.<br/><br/>I've not bothered to look at anything about the team who made it but it has the feel of a vanity project authored by a group of wealthy film school graduates in their twenties who have minimal experience of life but who have seen a lot of European ""art cinema"". One recent film it reminded me of was ""La Grande Belleza"", the difference being that that film actually had some interesting ideas and strong performances.<br/><br/>I stopped watching twice and had a hard time convincing myself to invest any more time on it; on the second occasion, a couple of minutes into the concertscene, about 15 minutes before the end (it feels almost interminable) I didn't bother to resume. Toward the end of this pretentious and totally unconvincing farrago there are a couple of extended expository monologues which attempt to plug the holes in the sieve which constitutes a plot. <br/><br/>There's so much wrong with ""Youth"" it's impossible to find anything positive to say about it. To call it pretentious garbage would be to compliment it. The two star leads should be ashamed of themselves; they surely can't need the money."
"El_John","7","22","39","30 November 2015"," Beautiful film with some flaws in the dialogue
","If there ever was a trailer that could not sell his movie right, then it is the one for ''Youth'' by acclaimed director Paolo Sorrentino, who's previous film was the Oscar-winning ''The Great Beauty''. The trailer made it look like a generic feel-good comedy, but it turned out to be a heart-warming, emotional and beautiful film.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a resort hotel in the Alps, where a retired conductor (Michael Caine) and his friend, a film director (Harvey Keitel) who writes the screenplay for his ''Testament'', are on holiday. Both are confronted with their past, future and momentariness.<br/><br/>Both actors have a great supporting cast on their side, everyone with their own burdens: Rachel Weisz plays Caine's daughter who is also his assistant, who feels neglected by her father and, in an great emotional monologue, expresses her feelings towards him. Paul Dano plays a character actor who is only known for a single insignificant role and wants to be recognized as a versatile actor. Jane Fonda plays a Diva who was a regular collaborator with Keitel's character and also has a great dialogue scene with him. Other characters are a retired Maradonaesque football player and a masseuse who touches than talks and many other great characters.<br/><br/>It would seem that all these ''damaged'' characters would give this film an overly sentimental tone, but drama and humor is so well balanced that the shift between comedy (and there is a lot of it) and drama never seems abrupt and doesn't interrupt the pacing of the film.<br/><br/>From the first minute on one will clearly see what Sorrentinos strength as a director is: Extremely beautiful visuals. Whether it is just the landscape or the daily routine of the people within the hotel: Every frame is just beautifully composed and looks astonishing. Rarely can a film with a run time of 2 hours constantly produce one great looking shot after the other. In combination with the great score by David Lang, ''Youth'' creates a unique and relaxing atmosphere that will ensure a great time at the theater.<br/><br/>As great as this movie may sound so far, it unfortunately is not flawless. As funny and great the dialogue is, at times it ruins the film completely with how unsubtle some of the important character moments are. In one scene, Caine and Dano are in a store and a little girl approaches Dano. She tells him that she knows him from a movie. He immediately assumes that she is referring to his robot role, but then she talks about a little known drama and tells him how it affected her life and instantly after her dialogue is finished she runs away with the camera facing Danos reaction so everybody in the audience knows that it was an important scene for his character. Another examples would be ham fisted lines like: ''What awaits me outside?'' -''Youth'' or the scene with the binocular from the trailer. The problem with these scenes is not that they are bad, on the contrary, they are important for the films' themes and characters. The problem is that they feel disconnected from the narrative and do not feel like they fit naturally within the plot."

","Scientists need to study this movie. It appears to have the ability to slow down time itself. In fact, I theorize that if your were to watch this movie in a continuous loop, over and over, you could actually live forever. Of course, spending eternity watching this movie would also be the very definition of hell itself. So there's that.<br/><br/>At what I thought was about an hour and a half into this movie (it was actually only 38 minutes), I had the urge to turn on the Golf Channel just to spice things up a bit. One can only watch so many scenes of self-absorbed existentialism in sequence without feeling time being noticeably stretched. Coming in at just over 2 hours, this movie pushes that envelope to an unreasonable extent.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only saving grace about movies like this is that I myself am not famous enough to have such a movie dedicated in my namesake. My condolences to Francesco Rosi on this particular account. Condolences to Messr's Caine and Keitel as well though I doubt their careers will be marred by such a forgettable film.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and spend the 2 hours you would've invested in this movie with your kids/grandkids.

","A lot should be expected of Paolo Sorrentino after ""La Grande Bellezza"", and there is a lot here. In particular, I should mention first the scenery and cinematography, and the music, all of which are sublime.<br/><br/>The dialogue is provocative, full of memorable lines and strong emotions, so kudos to the writers. The subject matter was heavy, but there is a fair share of lighter moments, and, in particular, irony.<br/><br/>I would not think that the acting was at all improvised, with the possible exception of some of the riffing the ""screenwriters"" working with Harvey Keitel's character were doing. Still, strong performances in particular from Keitel, Jane Fonda in a small role, the young actress who plays the masseuse, and a dignified Michael Caine.<br/><br/>Sorrentino continues to give homage to Fellini, which I love, while his central characters (Caine in this one, Toni Servillo in LGB) work through the kind of existential issues which Fellini tackled and which Sorrentino, though he is not an old man, seems to be anticipating. Nostalgia, regret, the sweetness and the bitterness that comes from the awareness of the limitations of our short lives. <br/><br/>The one thing that struck me as useless to the story--maybe I just didn't get it--was the turn Paul Dano's character made for a couple of scenes as...well, I shouldn't spoil it. It struck everyone in the scenes as inappropriate, and I guess that was the point, but really, why? For me, that takes it down to a 9 rating--still, a top-notch effort."

It will never become a classic, you'll probably not watch until the end let alone watch it twice, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't demand their money back if they saw it at the cinema. <br/><br/>Pointless, long, boring, mostly badly acted, terribly scripted, without one single solitary uplifting thing.

The Queen's Emissary arrives asking Fred to conduct his most famous composition Simple Songs for Prince Phillip's birthday concert. The contrasts between apparently happily retired Fred and Mick, who is having a hard time of making his current movie provide interesting contrasts, and Caine and Keitel look like they genuinely enjoyed working with each other on this one. Rachel Weisz as Fred's daughter Lena has some success at linking apparently unrelated scenes.<br/><br/>But mostly there are long moody silences with gorgeous Swiss backdrops, hotel entertainers struggling to captivate their onlookers and sequences that seem to provide little except bemusement about what they were about and why they were there. Every now and then we get some light relief in the form of voluptuous naked women, tantalising scenes in swimming pools or forests, pop song video clips, Adolph Hitler and an overweight soccer player demonstrating that a big belly can assist in juggling a tennis ball with your feet.<br/><br/>It struck me there were too many ideas, and the spa hotel setting makes it easy for other guests to appear without rhyme or reason.

","Sorrentino's previous movie ""La Grande Bellezza"" was, for me, the Best movie of 2013. I watched it several times and I was always delighted about how it was able to talk about profound themes in such a sensible and exquisite way.<br/><br/>In this new movie I feel Sorrentino tries to replicate the successful formula and it fails miserably. It's like a poorer version of ""La Grande Bellezza"". A lot of the themes, scenes and events that take place in the previous movie are present here: the opposition between ""old"" and ""new"", a little girl having a tantrum, a friend that talks about a young couple that is falling in love, a religious character that evokes simplicity and kindness Beyond lacking the sense of novelty, the dialogues are hollow and flat and all is done in a way that makes the movie looks pretentious and shallow.<br/><br/>I was hoping for something that would delight me like the previous movie did, and that's exactly what Sorrentino tries to make, but it turned out to be a great deception!"
"mskirollos","5","2","2","23 January 2016"," Less powerful variation on ""La Grande Bellezza""
","Following the huge success and critical acclaim of his film ""La Grande Bellezza – The Great Beauty"" in 2013, a winner of Oscars' Best Foreign Film for 2013 among numerous other awards, a modern favorite of mine and what I think was the best film of its year, the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino's following film is ""La Giovinezza - Youth"", a film in English, with an English-speaking cast, for which he did the writing. After reviving the Felliniesque spirit in The Great Beauty and the modern, powerful tour-de-force cinematic ride that it was, it was inevitable that the following work, after losing the element of novelty, will never reach the same heights especially with the high expectations placed, unless the writer/director opted for a different style, which he did not. Youth was a continuation of the same theme.<br/><br/>The story follows two old friends, an orchestra conductor and a film director, played by the greats Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel in very fine performances, on long vacation in a luxury hotel at the Alps. They reflect on their lives, as well as their children's and the peculiar hotel guests', contemplating in a poetic way what makes life worth living.<br/><br/>As expected, collaboration with the cinematographer Luca Bigazzi yielded another feast for the eyes. The great cinematography, along with the impeccable acting, is probably what propels the film forward and makes it worth the admission fee. Writing, however, was the main low point of the film, with the bland, monotonic, over- baked dialogue that helped give the story an overall feeling of hollowness and pretentiousness. It is not Sorrentino's first attempt at writing and directing English films, but it can still be argued that a significant difference in the level of writing between the last two films suggest that the outcome might have been better if the film were in Italian.<br/><br/>Comparison with Sorrentino's previous film, however, is inevitable and the parallels are too many. In the previous film we had the ageing protagonist reflecting on the meaning of life and the modern decadence while wandering the streets of Rome and in between raucous parties with his rich, idle companions. Here the streets and rooftops of Rome are replaced by the Alps. A long polemic monologue ruthlessly slating a friend is replaced by one given by Rachel Weisz's character and another given by Jane Fonda's in an impressive cameo. Instead of the Catholic nun, we get a Buddhist monk, where the predictable storyline meant that the acquainted viewer would know before the end of the film whether we will be able to see him levitate or not.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the film felt less surreal and magical even though it tried so hard at profundity and abstraction, the flat dialogue at most times was not helped by the persistence of the mountainous background, but the film definitely had its moments, the Maradona interludes an example, and the visual mastery and brilliant acting make the film worth watching. This was hardly surprising after The Great Beauty, but I sincerely hope Sorrentino bounces back in his next feature."
"Iwould","8","14","27","2 June 2015"," a costume drama about old age
","""Youth"" is a movie about age: lots of words are spent about being old, and you must eventually assume that the title of the movie is defined by exclusion. Most of interactions are between couples (friend with friend, father with daughter) whose talks very rarely sound like actual talks, and very often look like monologues. Not strange at all, anyway, as a third important subject (a.k.a. the audience) is always present – so the talking is basically for us. People that complain with Sorrentino for these kind of things just don't understand what the man is trying to do: yeah, his characters looks like they have written words in front of them and are taking turns to deliver their own, but, guess what, this is a perfect definition for the term ""acting in a movie"". Peace.<br/><br/>Michael Caine shines in the leading role, in his usual soft-spoken and controlled fashion. He is surrounded but two magnificent counterparts, the old (but young inside) Harvey Keitel and the young (but old inside) world famous actor portrayed by Paul Dano. These characters allow us to see how, never mind the age, you are just as much young as you want to be (the word ""Youth"" is possibly used in this movie as an alternate definition of ""Life"": you can be a youngster of 10, 30 of 70 years old, as long as you keep on learning from your mistakes). Harvey Keitel gets a very rare chance to star in the role of an intellectual, a director who's writing his ""testament"". He has a real great cinema-moment (the women of his movie life, reunited in a dreamy swiss panorama, halfway between Fellini 8 1/2 and Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ending montage), and provides energy and credibility to a character who's not entirely able to come to terms with his life (which is what Michael Caine eventually accomplish): as life is what it is, of course, but life is all there is - of course.<br/><br/>I would have skipped the final sequence with the concert: you can't keep on talking about a great piece of art for the whole movie, and then make the big mistake of trying to show it, as such great expectations are easy to be failed. But anyway I liked the strange unreal feeling of this movie, his peculiar setting and choice of characters, their detached reflections about life: it looks like a fantasy movie, or a ghosts story. I believe that it can be enjoyed by anybody, despite the age, regardless of the stage of ""Youth"" you currently are or feel in."

The movie is simply a exposition of the opposition between elderliness and ""YOUTH"".<br/><br/>The photography is pretty much impeccable and as I said every frame looks like a painting, I mean, ANY still of the movie would look amazing in your living room wall.

The only two times you see special effects, they kinda suck...<br/><br/>About the acting... I don't think there's much to say... Lately, in the non- blockbuster flicks, I watch Michael Caine and just see him doing his thing... Pretty much as him playing himself... And he's good, even very good, but there's not that spark that makes it a ""brilliant performance"". I feel the same way about Harvey Keitel. Rachel Weisz was good, but I don't think her character was so well constructed, Paul Dano's on the other hand had the most interesting character of the whole movie and was impressive as Jimmy Tree. Jane Fonda received a nomination to the Golden Globe, but she was on screen for two scenes only, so... I don't know...<br/><br/>The movie was pretty much about the visual and left the story to be read between the lines (or between the frames)...The story is pretty good but the movie is not about it...

","Sorrentino's follow up to the masterpiece that is ""The Great Beauty"" proves he is one of the most interesting, unique, energetic and visually stimulating voices in today's cinema even though it does not quite live up to standard he set himself with his previous film. Now, that is in no way a detraction to the film itself, but it definitely left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>I will get out of the way immediately what I found wrong with the film. Firstly, it simply isn't as organic and fluent as it should be. Even the photography is uneven to itself. Now I don't know if that was intentional or not, but the fact that I didn't understand it proves the point. And I am not talking about the surrealist scenes with I actually and obviously adored, I am talking about the overall tone and storytelling which switches gears a little bit too often, especially in the third act. Up until there it wasn't bugging me that much, but the third act made it sink and to this contributed a very weird end credits sequence, if you'll see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. Moreover, the movie isn't as clear cut as it needs to be. I am not talking about being direct, actually I enjoyed the fact that it is very open to interpretation in parts and directs your interpretation in others, yet again there is too much switching from one to the other and it made for some murky moments throughout. It is not like I want to be told everything, it's just that the film set itself up for being mentally stimulating and it wasn't as much as I wanted. Actually the parts were it was direct were the best, on the other hand I wasn't given enough space or material to think about the more interpretable parts and this made for a slightly and surprisingly forgettable impact.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is much that can be enjoyed, which compensates for the holes that were left there. Firstly, no one does surrealism as good as Sorrentino. There were a couple of sequences were I was just in total ecstasy. Sorrentino knows how to fill that screen and use it to the best of its potential with imagery and he proves here again he is able of delivering absolutely absorbing and exhilarating experiences, the best part being the fact that they aren't a gimmick they always fit the storytelling perfectly. He also knows very, very well how to use music to the best of his advantages. Also brilliant is Luca Bigazzi's cinematography. I know I said it was uneven before and that is true, but when you stop and look at it scene by scene you just cannot take it all in. The cast is also wonderful. Keitel and Caine are simply fantastic, Dano does perfectly what he is given to do, but it's Weiz that for me stole the show and gave another great performance. There are very few actresses that fill the screen appropriately and as perfectly as she does. This film is also enormously quotable, I lost count of how many times in the theater I wished I had a notepad to write down a sentence a character used. Even better is the fact that they always felt genuine and not showy. This speaks to what I said before: the film is miles better in what it says directly to what it leaves open. Now that is not to say that the open ended stuff is bad or aimless. For that type of pseudo-intellectualism s**t just look at ""The Tale of Tales"" out this week too. That is the type that is simply vain. In this movie it's just very murky, there are some parts that work others that don't but you always feel that it is coming out genuinely.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed myself and I can't define me disappointed, I am just a little bit let down, but then again I was excepting too much. I am still very torn on my grade and will use a future viewing to settle it. This film is worth your time I don't know if it's an 8 or a 7.5, just know that it is very good."
"lavatch","Null","6","11","6 April 2016"," Pretentious Art Film
","With all due respect to the brilliant actor Michael Caine, this film was awful! <br/><br/>High in the Swiss Alps, Caine plays a retired music conductor living out his final days as a morose and bitter old man. The film seeks to dramatize his awakening and his rediscovery of youth! <br/><br/>What a crashing bore! <br/><br/>Caine's character of Fred Ballinger has a daughter named Lena (Rachel Weisz), who serves as his publicist-manager. This character made no sense in the film because Fred had retired and he was fending off a British delegate from the Queen to return to England for to conduct a performance of his magnum opus of ""Simple Songs."" For the coherence of the screenplay, the daughter should have been negotiating with the delegate. Instead, she has no action or relevance to the film, other than to make the father even more callous and unsympathetic. The film included a set of cardboard characters whose dialogue sounded scripted. <br/><br/>There is also a parallel plot about a film director, as played by Harvey Keitel, who is in the process of conceiving a film that is to be his swan song. Of course, the subplot permits the filmmakers to explore the highbrow theme of ""art representing life,"" and so on...ad nauseam. The lame attempts at humor with Caine and Keitel cracking jokes about their prostate problems were not funny and bogged the film down even more.<br/><br/>None of the characters were believable, and ""Youth"" appeared to be capitalizing on the success of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" a film with more humor and more imagination."
"zetes","9","6","11","5 January 2016"," Probably not for everyone, but I loved it
","I'm not sure if the parts of this film make a great sum, but all the parts sure are fantastic! I quite loved this bizarre little film from the director of The Great Beauty. In fact, I liked it more than The Great Beauty, which I also liked a lot. Michael Caine stars as a retired composer/conductor who is spending a week at a ritzy Swiss spa. His longtime best friend, Harvey Keitel, a still-working film director, is also there. There isn't a strong plot here, more a series of vignettes, but much of Caine's plot revolves around an emissary from Queen Elizabeth II trying to get him to come back from retirement to play a concert for Prince Philip's birthday. Keitel is working on his new film with a slew of young, hipsterish writers. Other subplots involve Caine's daughter, Rachel Weisz, dealing with her husband's leaving her, and Paul Dano plays an actor who's a little peeved he's best known for playing a robot in ""that robot movie."" There are other little subplots, although I'd more call them just weird characters wandering around the spa. Sorrentino obviously wants to be the heir to Fellini, and he's doing a pretty good job of it. This film doesn't feel as much like Fellini as The Great Beauty did, but he has Fellini's eye for casting wonderful weirdos to populate his movies. In particular, I'm totally in love with Caine's masseuse, the gal with the braid and the braces, played by Luna Zimic Mijovic, whom we get to watch dance along to a video game a couple of times and it's just heavenly. Both Caine and Keitel are wonderful. Weisz gets to steal the film for one big monologue, though she's great for the rest of it, too. I don't know if I entirely get it, but I loved it, and it's one of the best of the year."
"Turfseer","5","6","11","20 December 2015"," Great cinematography can't save downbeat tale of composer who has lost his mojo
","After his big success with ""The Great Beauty,"" Paolo Sorrentino is back with an English language version of essentially the same story. In place of Toni Servilo as Jep Gambardella, an aging Rome journalist facing a mid-life crisis, we now have Sir Michael Caine as Fred Ballinger, a slightly older composer who also finds that he's stuck in a rut.<br/><br/>The setting here in Youth is a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps. The inciting incident resolves around an invitation from a representative of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip for Ballinger to conduct his most famous piece, ""Simple Songs,"" at Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Wouldn't you guess but Fred, the curmudgeon that he is, refuses, citing a lack of interest in pursuing music as a career at this late date.<br/><br/>There are other assorted characters at the resort including Ballinger's daughter, Lena, winningly played by Rachel Weisz. Lena works as her father's assistant but is also married to the son of Ballinger's good friend, Mick Boyle (played by an impressive Harvey Keitel), an aging filmmaker who also appears to have lost his mojo. When Lena is dumped by her husband she goes into a tailspin until she finds romance with a strange guy with a beard, a mountain climber, also at the resort.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Fred and Mick trade stories about women they used to know, particularly one who they both had an unconsummated relationship with. Unlike Fred, who still is talented, Mick has seen his better days, deceiving himself that his latest film which he is working on with a bunch of young screenwriters, is a ""testament"" of sorts.<br/><br/>Other odd characters show up including Paul Dano as Jimmy Tree, a frustrated actor remembered only for a commercially successful but aesthetically bankrupt role as a robot, Roly Serrano as a very overweight former soccer star Maradona, Luna Mijovic as a young masseuse who imparts sage advice to Fred, and Madalina Ghenea as an enigmatic and alluring Miss Universe who catches the eyes of both Fred and Mick while bathing.<br/><br/>Despite Keitel's efforts, he's unable to do much with the character of Mick, who turns out to be a real sad sack, particularly after his long-time leading lady Brenda Morel (sensationally performed by Jane Fonda), changes her mind about acting in his latest project and instead has agreed instead to act in a new television series. Brenda's decision results in (super spoilers ahead) Mick's suicide.<br/><br/>Ballinger's story is equally downbeat as he continually reiterates the fact that he's no longer interested in music mainly due to his invalid wife being unable to perform the part he wrote for her. Whether it was Mick's death or a visit to his wife who we find out has dementia (or a combination thereof), Ballinger rather predictably changes his mind, and ends up accepting the Queen's invitation.<br/><br/>Jep Gambardella's epiphany in The Great Beauty appears better thought out than Ballinger's, and the characters and situations in general are more compelling than what Sorrentino has proffered up here in Youth. Sorrentino's regular cinematographer, Luca Bigazzi, continues to impress with all kinds of sensational shots and Youth is certainly worth watching for the visuals, instead of the feeble story.<br/><br/>One wonders if Mr. Sorrentino really has much more to say about life in general. Fred Ballinger's reclamation is hardly something to get excited about after experiencing all his downbeat ruminations throughout a narrative which was told much better in Sorrentino's earlier and much more impressive masterpiece."

When dealing with film-making on this level the increments of mastery are so close together they can be safely ignored.<br/><br/>Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz and Paul Dano head the cast. All are superb, with Caine in particular excelling - it's not at all surprising that he has won the European Film Award for best actor. May it be one of many such accolades for this performance.<br/><br/>What is perhaps particularly astonishing about Youth is its immense sympathy for those who are twice the age of its director/writer. His compassion is clear in every frame of his movie. As an old guy myself, I'm grateful for that."

","After the movie ended I could not bring myself to get out of my seat and leave the cinema. Soon I felt the urge to see it again for it has moved and mesmerized me.<br/><br/>Why did this movie have such an effect on me? There are several reasons: One is because the movie stays physically very close to its main characters – similar to the movie Birdman but with other artistic measures. The result is the same though - you get sucked into mental web.<br/><br/>Another reason is the way the main character is introduced - namely with a question posed to him. The storyline makes a full circle to get to the answer at the end of the movie. We are caught in this circle and taken along a philosophical journey through the meaning of life with all its important issues.<br/><br/>A third reason is the director's talent for subtle comic insertions that loosen the seriousness. Sorrentino manages to show the tragic moments not agitated and with an understatement which Michael Caine is the ideal actor to achieve.<br/><br/>It's not a movie about old people for old people. It's a movie about life for all people.<br/><br/>A role as important as the characters are the beautiful musical score and the visual presentation: highly artistic and with a lot of power of imagination and creativity. There are unusual and unexpected combinations of picture and sound, never seen like that before. It all makes a well-rounded entity and establishes Sorrentinos own authentic style.<br/><br/>This is an important movie to be ranked with Tree of life and Synecdoche New York."

I would have given it 10 stars except for a poorly written character trait implied in Michael Cain's ""Fred Ballinger"" to appeal to the gay community for God knows what reason. It doesn't fit into the character's personality or lifestyle at all, and so it made no sense and was purely gratuitous.<br/><br/>Aside from that one issue, I found this movie to be a ""masterpiece"", combining sights, sounds and thoughts in a totally original fashion, and takes place in a setting I can't recall ever seeing in any other motion picture.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless from all involved, as is the casting, sets, editing, and most of all: 'the music'. I have since purchased the blu-ray of this film, and have watched it more times than I'd care to admit, and I've never been able to control my emotions at the very end with the voice of an angel soprano singing her heart out to a song that not only should have been nominated for an Oscar (it was), but should have won it hands down.

Michael Caine, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano and Harvey Keitel all give terrific performances.<br/><br/>The movie dose have some pacing issues, as I felt like some scenes dragged out a little bit, but I'm not sure if that's done on purpose or by mistake since this movie is out of it's mind when it comes to it's style of film making. Some people may think that this movie is too pretentious (some of the reviews I've seen), but I didn't think it was and it didn't bother me that much.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing ""Youth"" if you like movies that are very dreamlike and focuses on it's visuals."
"oscaralbert","10","4","8","19 January 2016"," Some of the reasons that YOUTH is better than REVENANT . . .

When ""Hitler"" places as just the fourth creepiest character in a flick, you know that that picture has a lot going for it. Ask yourself this, as well: Did REVENANT feature a well-endowed full-frontal Miss Universe? Or a command performance of a haunting tune for the Queen? Or a dozen amazing live acts on a turntable? Or cow symphonies? Or a Daddy\Daughter nightmare-in-bed scene? Or violin lessons? Or massage tables where happy endings are not foregone conclusions? Or existential fights for survival where the combatants are fresh and clean, NOT scruffy and infested? Or a dying fat man able to volley a tennis ball off his ankle? Or one intriguing mystery after another to keep you guessing? Or breath-taking strolls through the Swiss Alps? Is REVENANT really anything more than a tedious slog through the swamps of Yesteryear?"

","This movie is indeed a great example of how Italian sense of film-making can really be married with contemporary English and Hollywod cast, mixed together with the commonly found philosophical art house blend of ironic comedies. The story really puts a poetic reasoning to the subject matter of old age. The movie is filled with long talks, which look more like responded monologues. But of course any ironic setups won't be complete without actually putting in the opposite of the subject. This movie puts it good a dose of young talents with adequate significance where the irony really bites when it comes. The acting is indeed a great job. Michael Caine can really depict the depth of the character, without having to overly expressing. His acting feels very natural especially when we compared each of his scenes. Harvey Keitel, Paul Dano and Rachel Weisz did very well to complete the angles and give nuances to the movie. Jane Fonda did well in stealing the scenes even with her short screen time."

","I saw the trailer for this film, I was instantly attracted because of members of the cast, and it did look interesting, and with good critical reviews and award nominations I was even more attracted, directed by Paolo Sorrentino (The Consequences of Love, This Must Be the Place, The Great Beauty). Basically Fred Ballinger (Sir Michael Caine) is a retired classical music composer, Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) is a filmmaker working on his next project, both men are Septuagenarians and best friends staying at a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps. Fred is approached by an Emissary for Queen Elizabeth II (The Inbetweeners' Alex Macqueen) who want him to perform his popular piece ""Simple Songs"" for the birthday concert of Prince Philip, Fred downs this offer down, saying he is not interested in performing anymore, although when alone he composes pieces in his head. Mick is working with a group of scriptwriters to develop the screenplay for his next film, which he calls his ""testament"", also with them is actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano) who is researching for an upcoming role and frustrated that he is only recognised for playing a robot. Other quirky individuals inhabiting the hotel include a young masseuse (Luna Zimic Mijovic), the overweight Diego Maradona (Roly Serrano) and Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea). Fred and Mick reflect on their lives, including women they both previously had feelings for and their friendship over the years, they admit that their memories are fading and they see little in their futures. Fred's daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) is his personal assistant and married to Mick's son, but the husband leaves her for pop star Paloma Faith, who he says is much better in bed, Lena vents her anger on her father, who was always distant during her childhood and growing up. The Emissary returns with the same offer for Fred, he still refuses to play his popular piece, even for royalty, the Emissary gets frustrated with the lack of explanation, Lena cries when Fred finally explains that the soprano part of his ""Simple Songs"" belongs to his wife, but she can no longer sing, the Emissary understands. Mick completes his screenplay with the writers and is satisfied, his leading actress Brenda Morel (Golden Globe nominated Jane Fonda), who the role is written for and has worked with Mick on eleven of his previous films, makes a surprise visit to the resort, Brenda tells him she has taken a television role instead, she says television is the future and cinema is the past, she also tells Mick he has not made a good film in years. Mick is disheartened and hallucinates all of his leading ladies, including Brenda, surrounding him, he has a final talk with Fred and jumps off the balcony right in front of him, Fred is devastated. Following the funeral for his friend, Fred decides for the first time in years to visit his wife, she is senile and in a care home in Venice, in the end Fred returns to the United Kingdom for the concert before the Queen and the Prince to conduct ""Simple Songs"", with new soprano Sumi Jo. Also starring Ed Stoppard as Julian, Nate Dern as Funny Screenwriter, Alex Beckett as Bearded Screenwriter, Mark Gessner as Shy Screenwriter and Tom Lipinski as Screenwriter in Love. Caine gives a great performance as the veteran conductor refusing to perform for royalty for emotional personal reasons, Keitel is also likable as the aged movie producer and director, they are a great double act, Fonda is fantastic in her short appearance, Weisz is good, and there is a scene-stealing nude scene from the gorgeous Ghenea. This is a great example of an art house film, director Sorrentino is known for doing these sorts of films, it is an unusual blend of simplistic scenes, combined with a witty and funny script, surreal and psychedelic material, and wonderful music by David Lang, all add up to a satisfying alternative comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for the beautiful ""Simple Song #3"". Very good!"
"danielefanin-17409","7","8","21","15 June 2015"," Youth - The Greatest Beauty
","Paolo Sorrentino's latest movie, the director's return to Cannes after the worldwide success gained with the Best Foreign Movie Oscar (yet the Croisette didn't particularly liked the film which later on won at the Academy Award), could and should be appreciated by the Neapolitan director-screenwriter's admirers, for his usual subtlety of camera work and the and memorable lines, as well as by his detractors, for the unexpectedly solid and consistent story development, something that in the past The Great Beauty's director has seldom achieved. And indeed there is much more beauty in Youth than in Sorrentino's former hit, exactly for the savvy mix of images and narration, for the excellent compactness of the cinematic language and writing, regrettably missing in the calligraphic series of beautiful images that made up The Great Beauty. In an exclusive and secluded thermal hotel on the Swiss Alps gather, like elephants at a savanna watering hole at dusk, guests of every age and origin, each looking for something different but all joined by the lack of this ""something"". With the calm and lightness of a glider, the movie flies over Fred, a retired great musician and conductor searching his human dimension in addition to his musical one, and Mick, a famous director searching a last movie which could amazingly seal a career that, however glittering, started to show the unmistakable signs of a slow decline. The movie takes the viewer, with crafty and touching empathy, to the final results of these searches, harmonic for Fred, dystonic for Mick. Captivating in the title choice, identifying youth with the inner search and growth rather than the body biological age, Youth is structured in dwindling layers, strongly integrated and unified: a protagonist (a self-controlled and convincing Michael Caine as Fred), a co-protagonist (the dependable Hervey Keitel as Mick), two secondary characters (an emotionally involved Rachel Wiesz as Fred's daughter and a cautious and endearing Paul Dano as the Californian star), circled by a chorus of characters painted with few yet definite strokes, reminding of the Commedia dell'Arte: the football legend beyond Sunset Boulevard, the masseuse of few words, the Alpine guide, Miss Universe, the Queen representative, the 100% made in Hollywood movie star (an ironic and charismatic yet ineffective Jane Fonda), the mixed group of your screenwriters, the silent couple.. The risky strategy of mixing faked reality (the Queen, the real pop start, the football star) to real narration proved to pay off: most probably Youth shall not gather the prizes and success of The Great Beauty but surely represents a clear leap forward towards Paolo Sorrentino's full maturity as a director and a screenwriter."

","Paolo Sorrentino (from Naples, Italy) has turned an astonishing movie.<br/><br/>The pace is sometimes slow, cautious, then brutally rapid. Two old men are of course acting a fine piece of craftsmanship, a composer, a film director, life-long friends find themselves disillusioned about life and old age and in turn react in different ways to this plight. Another extra dimension is the voyeuristic deployment of life in a five star hotel in Switzerland, its kings, the guests and their servants, the hotel staff.<br/><br/>The well-to-do and celebs of this world find a retreat in exclusive fine hotels to find their bearings, to relax in the wellness facilities, a possibility to unwind in their hectic lives. Sorrentino has conjured up an impressive array of stars and talents, but this sometimes seems like a casting event. Overdoing the good thing: Maradona"" makes a surprise appearance as well as a Hitler impersonator. Sorrentino gives Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel a wonderful stage for their (dirty) old men phantasies and memories of the past. The composer Fred Ballinger was notoriously unfaithful to his wife Melanie, who put up with it, only to end up as a demented death mask of the only person he really loved in a psychiatric ward in Venice. His daughter confronted him with his past, his emotionally starving her, his unfair unfaithfulness. Fred, being retired, is apathetic, once directs a herd of cows mooing and the sound of their cowbells. He refuses to have his memories published, refuses stubbornly to conduct his Simple Songs"" for the British Queen, who sent an emissary, speaking the Queen's English, who seemed to be unsuccessful in convincing Fred to perform just this once more. At the end of the movie we can see him complying blandly, but with great success. His scenes with his daughter, who was just abandoned by her young lover, who preferred Paloma Faith to her.<br/><br/>are very moving. The dialogue has some very open discussion of love, sex and marriage, there are scenes of outspoken passion of great intensity. Some great takes are performed by young talents, the young masseuse, Paul Dan (Jimmy Tree) who played a young blasé actor whose ennui of being identified with just one film role is quite understandable and well done. Then there is this young girl who absolutely astonishes the former with her quip.<br/><br/>Nick Boyle, the famous film director describes his dozen or so films all as crap"" and is seen working on his last film project The Last Day in Life"" which is portentous because he ended his life after Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda ) told him just that in very outspoken terms.<br/><br/>He had prided himself to be a women's director"", in Wiesen"" (place name meaning ""meadows"") he sees dozens of his women characters in a dream-like scene, all talking to him, complaining, whispering. His entourage is seen brainstorming for film ideas, all to no avail, the ending of the film is still missing, the main woman character suddenly shows up, calling Nick destructive, repulsive, a failure. Both pretend to have furthered the other's career.<br/><br/>Some delightful scenes show philosophic questions being raised, dis- cussing old age, youth, love and marriage, fame, wealth. The two old friends have their fun and games, telling each other only the good things"" in life, playing tricks (mostly on Nick) and both complain of amorous and urinary problems ."

","I was so excited to see Youth. Michael Caine had been promoting it all year, claiming it was the movie he was most proud of in his career, and everyone hoped he'd finally nab the Best Actor Oscar. It didn't make it to any of my local movie theaters, but I rented it the first available weekend. Had I sat through it, it would probably be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thankfully, remotes have a little button called ""fast-forward"" so I was only forced to watch about thirty collective minutes.<br/><br/>Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are on vacation in a spa in the Alps. Michael is a retired composer, and Harvey is a film director. They're old friends, and they talk about their work, their families, and getting older. Michael's daughter, Rachel Weisz, shows up because her husband left her, and an aging actress, Jane Fonda, shows up to talk about a role. That's all I was able to get out of the plot. The disjointed scene transitions, strange music choices, minimalistic script, random nude women, and generally confusing storyline ruined the rest of the film. Unless you love ""art films"" and have the absolute opposite taste in movies as I do, I would tell you to stay as far away from Youth as possible.<br/><br/>Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity and confusing content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie."

","I do not think it is possible I could have liked this film any more than I did. I was watching it for the second time. The first time I loved it. But, I did not understand what a masterpiece it was. It is absolutely pitch perfect. The direction of the film is stunning. Hollywood should take notice. Few films come out of Hollywood like this lovely gem. This was entirely directed and produced by Italians. It has a magical realist quality to it, and some of the cinematography was positively mind boggling. If you look at some of my other reviews, I am often tearing films apart. Most of the stuff that comes out of Hollywood these days leave me cold and unsatisfied. <br/><br/>However, this film was written and shot for adults. I do not think the current crop of kids, that is fueling the boom in nonsensical action films, and comic reboots would get this film at all. Way, way too refined. Too much character development. Not enough action for the kiddies.<br/><br/>There are some great scenes of the writers on Kietel's film, where they are brainstorming the script of the film they are writing. It is a wonderful irony, as the script of this film is a thing of beauty. <br/><br/>This film centers around the characters of Michael Caine, and Harvey Kietel. Both very successful men. Caine a retired composer, and Kietel a movie director, nearing the end of his career. Wryly observing them closely, and striking up a friendship with Fred, is a movie star played by Paul Dano. The younger man is debating whether to escape his burdensome identification with a robot character in a sci-fi franchise with a drastic change of pace by playing Adolf Hitler in a movie. There is a wonderful scene where Miss Universe shows up and pays her respect to the Dano character. The dialogue is not at all what one would expect. Then Fred gets a visit from his disaffected daughter and personal assistant (Rachel Weisz). She's here to announce that her husband, Mick's feckless son (Ed Stoppard), has just dumped her for real-life rock star Paloma Faith, playing a parody of herself that stars like Mylie Cyrus, Brittany Spears, and many others would never be capable of. <br/><br/>As in Sorrentino's 2013 foreign-language Oscar winner ""The Great Beauty,"" the plot is less important than the characters and the opulent settings, which are populated with eccentric, magical characters in the background. This is a movie for adults. And this movie is a masterpiece. A simply stunning bit of filmmaking. Watch it with patience. Watch it with adoration. Watch it with respect. Watch it and yearn for the days when films of this caliber were more common."

Each time I have seen it I have noticed more connections, and developed a deeper understanding of the characters and the truths being gently portrayed. Humor sneaks in. And the music reaches into my depths. <br/><br/>Scenes continue to haunt me. A friend of mine agrees. Other friends have liked it, but not to the extent we have.

And then the end will have you rolling your eyes and drooling with laughter because the budget for this movie must have been outrageous and it was all 'for what?'.<br/><br/>The setting is a fancy Alps resort where the wealthy go to be treated for the aches and pains and frustration that comes with aging. The principle characters are Michael Caine who is a retired symphony orchestra composer/conductor, Harvey Keitel who is a washed up movie director, and Paul Dano (the only young one) who is an actor studying others for an upcoming role in a movie. Ninety percent of the movie is Dano eating, Caine telling everybody no, and Keitel obsessing on his swollen prostate gland! There are peripheral stories here but these three are the main characters.<br/><br/>Caine refuses to perform an orchestral piece he wrote for his wife as she was the only one who could do it to his liking and it was written for her only. Well old QE2 wants a command performance of this piece and the only quality in the Caine character is the fact he tells her absolutely not, he will stick to his principles and QE2 can just suck it up. Well you know what happens!!!<br/><br/>Now the best scene is the cameo appearance by Jane Fonda! She plays a brief scene made up as an angry, bitter, old drag queen movie star and she's damn good at it to!<br/><br/>This flick is strictly for cocktails, treats, and a movie night at home!

","This is by far the most beautifully made film I have come across in life! Such beauty! Not just visual or sonic beauty, the beauty of thought, the human condition- how beauty and melancholy are two sides of the same coin. It deserves all the acclaim it has got; it is truly a masterpiece. Nothing beautiful has ever been created without pain. Even a mother has to feel so much pain before she can hold her baby in her arms. It leaves me wondering what the makers of such a film must have experienced in life to create such a beautiful piece of art. It perfectly depicts the perspective of a musician and what drives him to create music; and actors who have to turn themselves into a different person for every new role. The movie perfectly depicts the contrast between youth and old age and yet it leaves a message that we are all the same regardless of how old or young we are and also that something beautiful is what holds emotional meaning to us rather than visual pleasure. The movie explains not only the complexities of inter- human relationships but the complexities of our existence in fast-moving time itself. Those lines in the movie that talk about ""human-touch"" and how so much can be understood about one another by just touch really moved me. And cast, cinematography, music, editing- everything together really complement each other."
"Laakbaar","9","3","7","17 November 2015"," Profound, beautiful, moving
","This movie is set in a Swiss wellness hotel. It's summer, and the mountain scenery is beautiful. The hotel (as grand hotels tend to do) has a rhythm and character of its own. <br/><br/>The guests are performers, many of whom are struggling with past glory. They are withdrawn from the world here, and the director captures the beauty, limitations and artificiality of their retreat. <br/><br/>Two of the guests, Fred and Mick, are elderly, and the movie focuses on them, especially Fred. (I must say Caine and Keitel played these roles extremely well.) <br/><br/>Those who require action and a forward-moving plot may not like this film so much. If you think about it, only two things really happen in the film (although I'm not going to disclose them here). The rest of the film was a complicated portrait of a particular place, specific people and a certain theme.<br/><br/>This cinematic portrait was painted with meaningful dialogue and beautifully filmed scenes. The scenes are varied and surprising -- sometimes surreal, sometimes whimsical, sometimes profound, sometimes banal.<br/><br/>This idiosyncratic non-Hollywood movie has profound things to say about old age and life in general. I'm not sure that younger people will really get it. Art, fame, memory, beauty, love, the very meaning of our lives... It's a difficult movie to review because I'm not sure I've grasped everything. I've only seen it once. I suppose one message is to lead your life to its fullest, even in old age. Move forward, not back. Feel, don't talk.<br/><br/>The beauty of the movie, the intelligence of the dialogue and the astonishing character development hammer home the movie's points in one devastating scene after the next.<br/><br/>I thought the final song at the end would bring it all together, and after looking at the lyrics, I suppose it does. It is too moving for words. I have to see this movie again, but I'm almost afraid to go. This movie caught me at a vulnerable point."

When everything you've ever done seems to be so far away, when it's meaningless you're left with so little. But of you've played out the little things through your life in the right way, they are significant and don't cause you to die with regret about what you've missed. And those little things, although the biggest in life but look little in comparison to the stupid goals we set upon ourselves, are our relationships. Value people, be true, love them and be what you have to be which is often different from what you want to be. But set in the right order ""have to"" and ""want to"" don't contradict themselves."

","Youth is a film that ironically would have been wasted on me when I was younger. My 20 year old self would have hated this film and probably switched it off after 15 minutes. So I can understand the mixed reviews this film gets. There is little or no action until the last 20 minutes, but for me the best parts were the quiet scenes with no action. There are many scenes where something is hinted at or insinuated. But nothing is ever spelled out for you. I was left thinking a lot about what I had just seen, trying to interpret what it meant or what was about to happen when the scene ended. Youth is beautifully shot, so if you're in the mood for a quiet film with gorgeous visuals and a dreamy soundtrack this is perfect. The plot, or more precisely the premise is about a group of people in a very picturesque holiday resort where everything looks heavenly and relaxing. They talk about life and old age etc. It sounds dull but for me those were the best parts. I only felt it lost its way towards the end, specifically at the moment Jane Fonda showed up. Even though she's very good in this (as is everyone else), her first scene is a long drawn out conversation with Harvey Keitel which shifts the mood of the piece completely. For the first time in the film I found myself bored because the scene dragged me out of the dreamlike mood that had gone before. After that the film trudged on to its finale but never recaptured the spirit of the first 90 minutes. But overall I recommend this film because it was unlike anything else I can recall seeing."

","The film ""Youth"" (La giovinezza) by the Italian director Paolo Sorrentino is a reflection of the deep crisis in Italian cinema.

One is a composer played by Michael Caine another is a filmmaker played by Harvey Keitel. Michael Caine plays his role well as usual and is the only reason why the film is remotely watchable.<br/><br/>Otherwise the film is dull, pretentious and lacks any new or interesting ideas. The cinematography was bland and unoriginal. The music was surprisingly awful considering this is a film about a famous and beloved composer.<br/><br/>The product placement for Microsoft Kinect was shameless, annoying and resembled a parody. The film had a positive critical response, however it is not a masterpiece, just utterly forgettable.<br/><br/>The film is just another imitation of Fellini in the same way as ""The Great Beauty"" (La grande bellezza) but ""The Great Beauty"" at least was not so flat out boring and monotonous.<br/><br/>It is time for the directors to stop stealing from the great masters and to their find own unique style and to produce new ideas and the film jurors should not encourage plagiarism either.<br/><br/>""Youth"" can only be recommended as a sleeping aid.<br/><br/>See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/"
"verna-a","5","2","4","17 February 2016"," A pose of profundity
","This is a continental production, and maybe the best guide for prospective viewers is whether they usually enjoy continental films or not. If you find them often stupid and affected it's easy to have the same impression of this film. I knew from the synopsis that plot and action wouldn't be the strong point of the film, but I did think that it might have humour, wit and pathos. In fact it has little of any of these. The screenplay tries to be quirky and different and to engage the viewer by bringing in grotesque characters and nude flesh. It's just enough to maintain sufficient interest, but any viewing enjoyment is largely created by the photography of beautiful settings. The dialogue is stilted, particularly in the mouths of child actors - maybe it's all translated which would explain the lack of realism. Overall,there's nothing too rewarding about watching the idle and overprivileged not really enjoying themselves in expensive comfort. You might expect there to be some pathos when one of the protagonists meets a sad end but in fact it seems like another piece of selfishness. To judge from the title the film plumes itself on having some philosophical message. It's hard to be sure what the message is. Maybe it's that selfish people finally realize that they have empty lives, but I'm guessing here. I thinks it's more ""let's make a movie which can pose as something deep and profound"". The musical item which ends the story is nice - in fact if it had gone on for another 10 minutes I would have felt more charitable towards the film. You've really got something better to do with your time than watch ""Youth""."
"CineMuseFilms","9","2","4","11 February 2016"," Unexpectedly, this one slides onto my list of all-time favourites.
","Resort genre films are curious things that work by isolating interesting character-types from their real lives into a fantasy setting where they can reflect, explore, regret or die. Youth (2015) does this using a painterly canvas of mostly humorous insights into love, success, failure and life's inescapable endpoint. Set in a luxury alpine resort amidst stunning scenery, the separate human sketches are individual artworks that merge into an opus greater than the sum of its parts. The cinematography and dramatic musical score forms a melancholic symphony blending sounds and images of youth and beauty, ageing and dying. It can just as easily confuse, overwhelm, or delight the senses.<br/><br/>Like life itself, the film is full of opposites: Michael Caine is the self-obsessed Maestro, the composer whose creativity has dried up as he mourns for his dying wife and once stellar career. Harvey Keitel, as film producer Mick, cannot stop working even though his films peaked a long time ago. When his long-time leading lady Brenda (Jane Fonda) tells him his career as a producer is finished, it triggers a masterful scene of understated pathos that many viewers will miss entirely unless paying close attention. As quick as a blink, Mick exits as just another extra on the stage of life.<br/><br/>But the elephant in the room asks: is this an old man's film? No it is not, and there is something for everyone. A voluptuous Miss Universe provides the marketing eye-candy with a few seconds of bare flesh and intelligent dialogue to prove beauty and brains co-exist. Maestro's beautiful daughter Lena, dumped by a husband wanting better sex, delivers a tour de force monologue about her absent father. An ex-sci-fi star offers deadpan wisdom wrapped in wry humour, and a monk's parodic levitation reminds everyone not to take it all too seriously. The wit and wisdom of beautiful young people cuts through the homilies of elders to stop Youth from being just a maudlin tale of loss. Unexpectedly, this one slides onto my list of all-time favourites."

","Having sadly missed Great Beauty I was looking forward to seeing Youth, in the lovely setting of the Phoenix Picturehouse in Oxford - a cinema where you are not in an audience but amongst friends. I must admit to having a bit of a thing about ""star"" actors - I see them as a necessary evil for financing purposes and would dearly love to see a film with no well-known actors to mess with my preconceptions - give me a clean slate not one riddles with past images. Enough of the rant! All the acting here is absolutely first class - of course with such a director. But it is the mesmeric quality of this film that sets it amongst the greats. Like a book you can't put down, your eyes are locked on this film as it brings you surprise followed by glorious images then surprise then more glorious images. Coupled with really brilliant sound the senses are overwhelmed. The need for a complex plot does not get in the way of Youth - that really is secondary which is one of the reasons this is such a beautiful film. I've dropped one star because the cutting was a little smug at times, but otherwise this is top cinema.If you like violence and car chases stay away. If you want to be swept up in cinema magic, see it."

","To say that Youth is a little odd would be a bit of an understatement. But not odd in a bad way , odd in a very , very good way. I absolutely loved this film. This is the story of a retired orchestra conductor ( Michael Caine) on holiday in a lavish retreat with his daughter and his film director best friend ( Harvey Keitel) in the Alps when he receives an invitation from the Queen to perform for Prince Philip's birthday. In all honesty this isn't really about the invitation , it's about getting old and how you reflect on life so differently than when you are younger. This looks fantastic . Sure it can be classed as a bit arty but director Paolo Sorrentino hasn't gone over the top with it instead he has got Michael Caine , to produce one of the best screen performance I have ever seen him perform. There are a few surreal moments that don't quite fit , like the cameo from Paloma Faith which seems to have been shoehorned into the film just to get her on screen but on the other hand I loved the scene with a fat Diego Maradona doing keepy uppies with a tennis ball. This won't be everyone's bag but it got me big time."

Like ""La grande bellezza"" the story is told slowly a little bit monotonic, which from one hand it's not adapted to everyone, on the other hand it give you the time and the depth to understand better the dilemma and the difficulty the the character have to deal with.. i think in order to really understand why Caine behave the way he does, Sorrentino choose one of the best way."

A orchestra conductor long retired spends time vacationing in a long in the Swiss alps accompanied by his oldest friend, a filmmaker working on a new picture. <br/><br/>Michael Caine was magnificent in this picture, but I must admit, I was drawn more to Harvey Keitel's character, mostly because his story was easier to follow. It's more of a standard plot than can be followed. Either way Caine and Keitel were great on the screen together. <br/><br/>Also liked Paul Dano in the picture who sports a vastly different look then I seen him in any of his other pictures. <br/><br/>I must admit that I did not really get what was going on all the time, but I think that was what the filmmakers wanted to do. To create a film that did not fit, or rather he created something that acts as total emotion and is hard to describe why you like it or why you don't<br/><br/>With that said, I really did like the performances of all the actors I mention and the performance of Rachel Weisz who is also in the movie.<br/><br/>I found it a beautiful tale of someone who remembers who he was a lot differently than others do."

It is obvious the director of the Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA winner for the movie 'The Great Beauty' delivered another similar ordinary concept about extraordinary fictional personalities. And the way of their life, especially when they meet the difficulties at some point of their lives.<br/><br/>From all, the casting of Michael Caine caught my interest on this. This is another wonderful movie with the hard work of the fine cast and the crew. There is a good chance for the movie in the upcoming Oscar and other prestigious awards node in a couple of categories, including for the Caine's performance. Because it looks like made for awards, rather breaking records at the box office.<br/><br/>Whatever the topic of the movie is, 'love' stands at the centre of the web. Human affections for each others, losing someone you love and at a same time falling for another. All about passing through 'love' in the life and in which, how strong is our grip on it to carry along with us to the end of the life was illustrated pretty compelling way.<br/><br/>The theme was bold, and everything shown was realistic. But it also makes some illusions to brief the other side of reality. For instance, a Buddhist monk who demonstrates his peaceful achievement, a fat man kicking a tennis ball high in the air et cetera, all these are the youthfulness of who are no more youths, citing as a desire for beyond their limits which is obviously what the title implies.<br/><br/>I won't expect everyone like the movie as I did, because it is not made for everyone. But you could try it and then decide your thought on this film. That is one of the way the movies like this can work for the people who are choosy sometimes.<br/><br/>8/10"

","All dressed up and nowhere to go. Paolo Sorrentino's previous film The Great Beauty was among my favourites of 2013. Youth has much of its style, but none of its substance. It certainly looked gorgeous, but left me feeling empty and unfulfilled.<br/><br/>The film talks a lot about emotions but it never creates them, just endlessly philosophises about them. Its characters remain not so subtle metaphors, but never real people.<br/><br/>There's nothing particularly wrong about Youth and at times it is quite enjoyable, its sin is in not achieving greatness which for a drama of this type is an absolute failure. It wants to be a grand statement about life but has nothing meaningful to say. It is still very watchable, specially if you like films of this type. Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are what makes it so with their fun portrayal of old friends. Beyond that there's not much else that has stuck to my mind about the film.

","Dear Paolo Sorrentino,<br/><br/>I don't really get this kind of movie where the main plot/sub plots are interspersed with epic shots of people involved in various activities that are supposed to make us realize the beauty of life. I also do not understand movies about Westerners living in a beautiful health spa feeling sad about their lives. I mean, what do these people have to be sad about?<br/><br/>The plot was interesting. Two oldies (Caine and Keitel)roam around a Swiss health spa ruminating about the lost opportunities in their lives and spying on other people. The sub-plots include a depressed actor (Paul Dano)preparing for a role. The character reminded me of Bill Murray's in Lost in Translation. There is Caine's daughter (Rachel Weiz) and Keitel's son who are seeing each other but break up. It was an interesting setting, Paolo. And Madalina Diana Ghenea made me press rewind - the film did have quite a few nude women. The rest of the movie made me want to fast forward despite the visual splendor.<br/><br/>The writing often gave the impression of being uninspired or contrived. There are quite a few references to levity by Caine's character. Caine's daughter who is ditched by her boyfriend and then falls for a mountain climber is shown kissing him while hanging off a cliff towards the end of the film. A Buddhist monk levitates. I am not sure what all this means.<br/><br/>The beautiful health spa made me sad because I do not have the money to go there. It is a movie of place. I hope Zoya Akhtar does not watch this film, she might remake it with crappy Indian actors.<br/><br/>I had enjoyed This Must be the Place (2011) a lot. But Youth was pretty tough to get through despite some good moments. Even Harvey Keitel looked bored. There was something very serene about Caine's expressions and body language.<br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin.<br/><br/>(5.5/10)"

","There are some moments in life, when you just feel that this day was worth living, just to see, experience or feel something. To discover something, the beauty or an emotion that you had not felt for some time now. Because ""emotions are not overrated"", that is all that we have got. Thanks to this movie, the ""Youth"", I have had this experience. It is a beautiful movie, a must-see, not just in its general way of speaking, but also as to (re)discover the beauty of a real masterpiece (maybe it seems like big words now, but not anymore, after you have seen it for yourself). I could write about the funny or deep dialogues or about the sophisticated and perfectly composed pictures (from a scene in the elevator, which seems more like a portrait from the seventieth century; not to mention the sights of Switzerland, which – with all its astonishing views - it is not more than a simple frame for the story). But rather we should talk about youth, symbolized by a beautiful – and not at all stupid - Miss Universe, but also by some teenager, sending us the message that, actually, they are understanding the important things in life, and more than that, they are understanding us, as well. The whole story goes around a friendship of two old friends, a composer and a screenwriter, who know each other so well, that they do not have to tell each other anything, but just the good things, that have happened to them. And while one of them is working on his last movie - his great testament - the other tries to be more occupied with his daughter and a new friend – an actor -, then to focus on the fact that he is aimlessas they say, apathetic. Through these meeting life paths, one can realize that money or success can give you any joy, but you will not remember anything else but the real emotions, the love, the fights with the loved ones, the work, in which you have had put your soul in it. Just the things, which we desire and inspire us for even more desires. In case this is a rather sentimental and personal view of this magnificent movie, one can just enjoy the pseudo - music video that Paloma Faith performs in one of the protagonist's nightmare. It is fantastic! Don't forget, a must-see."

The story focuses on an aging and retired music composer, played by Michael Caine, and his friend, a feature film director working on what may be his last opus, played by Harvey Keitel. Every frame of the film is carefully composed and uses light, like a brush...one moment could be reminiscent of Raphael nudes, the next Dali. The story, set in an elitist spa in Switzerland, dallies in that lush landscape, pairing it with vistas and grottoes of water, highly paid for fountains of youth, where sirens bathe and old men ogle. A friend saw the nod to Fellini's 8 1/2. I saw an auteur with fresh and unexpected expression, as if Bergman spiced one of his early works with the Chinatown Kung Fu film tradition. Original, unique, a film you don't want to miss, and a certain 2015 Oscar contender in multiple categories."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","2","5","20 November 2015"," Lazy compared to The Great Beauty, but there are some merits.
","Paolo Sorrentino impressed in 2013 with his Fellini soaked The Great Beauty, I didn't think it would win the Oscar, but it did deservedly. That opened doors for Sorrentino to, apparently, make something in the a similar vein but with A-list English language actors. That may not have been the best of choices given potential career paths. While The Great Beauty is a gorgeous sprawling character study with vibrant ambition, Youth stops short of that standard. We have a similar protagonist with Michael Caine, and there's no-one better to sprout off a life's worth of wisdom like Michael Caine, but the spark is lost. The ego is still here but it's coming with a self-satisfied smirk with smug ironies.<br/><br/>For starters, it absolutely should have done away with the cameos and musicians and actors playing versions of themselves. It's a big mish-mash of short stories that dip in and out, and while their individual arcs are solid and easy, it's a short step where film can otherwise leap. It's not always misguided, but it's often lazy. That's not to rob the aspects the film does right. The musings on memory are interesting, especially coming from Caine and Harvey Keitel, though the metaphors are quite heavy-handed. It's relatable in its its glistening cynicism and that's potent where it could have been swinging for universalities. They are however, hollow revelations due to its lack of character work, but no less valid. <br/><br/>Caine is a reliable lead, though he doesn't have much to do until the final act. However, Keitel is a welcome highlight doing what Keitel does best when he doesn't have a gun in his hand. Rachel Weisz however, is very mishandled and it was very difficult to connect to her character when she's dialled at a volume the film doesn't tune into. Jane Fonda has a solid part as a diva, but it's far too on-the-nose, while Paul Dano blends into the background, besides when he puts on a Hitler costume. Visually it is underwhelming compared to The Great Beauty though some of the smooth tracking shots remain. The soundtrack is ultimately the factor that needed the most work. Youth has its hits and misses but it's generally easy-going enough to get by, if not nearly as profound as it thinks it is.<br/><br/>7/10"

","An art house film with beautiful cinematography where Old man try to find peace of mind.<br/><br/>Youth remained me lot of The Great Beauty, and I just had to stop watching and make sure in IMDb that my suspicion that both movies are made by the same director is right.<br/><br/>Yup, I knew it, Paolo Sorrentino, same director.<br/><br/>His shot is so unique, many of his shots are like a painting, some scenes are shot just because the beauty of it. He is the only director I knew that have that kind of shot, not only he shot beautiful scene, but it's so artistic and classy at the same time. I guess that is his trademark. Just watch his movie you will know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>If Miller has the eyes for action Sorrentino has the eyes for beauty<br/><br/>I bet this will win the Oscar for the best cinematography<br/><br/>But I will never rate Sorrentino's film 10, Sorrentino's story I think is not for everyone.<br/><br/>It is slow paced. The lead characters mostly are old there is not much going on in his story, only life, just life.<br/><br/>If you can't see the beauty of the life itself, this movie is not for you."
"jrarichards","8","3","10","26 September 2015"," Great visual and auditory experience with interesting and novel fusion of Continental and Anglosphere film-making
","As I indicate in the summary title, this is on the one hand a profoundly ""Continental""-style film, even up to the Swiss mountain setting; and so it is full of intriguing and at times gorgeous visual impression, enigmatic happenings that pass over into the surreal from time to time, and such an overwhelming desire to be ""meaningful"" that it may readily be accused of straying into over-analysis. Great Polish Director Krzysztof Kieslowski - who also came close to the above threshold, but somehow still stayed successfully below it - once noted that film was not an especially useful medium for telling stories, illustrating this by asking how many minutes (hours?) of film you would need to convey one line from a book: ""he gradually came to see her less and less often, and eventually stopped seeing her altogether"". In similar vein, a sparser way of dealing with issues raised in the film ""Youth"" could theoretically be reduced to a single, 8-verse Louis Daniel Brodsky poem, or even simply to its ever-memorable title ""If Youth Knew and Age Could"" (admittedly said originally by a 16th-century Frenchman, and also later by Sigmund Freud). However, ... and this a big ""However"", the cast and acting of this film give it a British feel, or at least a trans-Atlantic one given the partnership of the film's key senior citizens, Brit Sir Michael Caine and Yank Harvey Keitel. While the latter actor has always been a firm favourite of this reviewer, the former has seemed a bit of an acquired taste. But with this film the acquisition process is complete. For me this would be Sir Michael's greatest ever performance, even if it is - in essence - just more of Michael Caine, albeit now Michael Caine as senior statesman of the film world, here beautifully devoid of any hint of that old, class-related ""chip on the shoulder"". Here he finds a niche, and his straightforward understatement conveys ideally the version of growing old that says ""I've kinda had enough really, given what life has thrown at me, but I'm accepting because there's absolutely nothing I can - or even want to - do about it"". This contrasts ideally with the more driven and up-beat Keitel as Caine's best friend and regular holiday companion. Indeed, the pair are ""almost related"" given that the daughter of Caine's character (an effective Rachel Weisz) has married the son of Keitel's, giving the film one of its several intriguing-enough plot devices. Both of these key male characters are artists - Caine a famous and sophisticated conductor and musician, and Keitel a prolific and sassy film-maker. Both are in essence past it, though the Caine character has no doubt about that, while the Keitel character has difficulties with the concept. As the film progresses, the two deal with these circumstances in quite contrasting ways (I'll write no more on that). On the way, there are numerous interesting and touching (and occasionally hotly erotic, farcical or shocking) juxtapositions of youth being able to but not yet knowing, and old age knowing but (largely if not wholly) not being able to - in the sublimely beautiful, yet above all staid and ordered and ""safe"", setting of a posh if oldie-worldie Swiss hotel for the very well-heeled. Overall, this film verges on the pretentious, and certainly would pass the boundary were it not for the Brits and Americans to drag it back down to Earth. But this makes for a rather new approach that in my view works quite nicely. The two key actors move us without even trying too hard, simply because they are now old men, let's face it. But the pairing is an extremely effective and convincing and joyous one. However, those choosing to see this film might wish to have at least hinted to them that a very great deal of the success here depends on its very last, closing scene - a profound and extremely powerful contrast with the rest of the film, if also a natural consequence of it, and one that will prove truly breathtaking for at least some of those who watch it - a real treat in store for the patient..."

","For decades now, I've watched countless films but I don't recall ever wanting to see a movie twice; that is, until I saw Youth directed by Paolo Sorrentino; and thrice is a real possibility.<br/><br/>How does one review a movie that so simply states, the essence of life is beyond words? While the movie is philosophical, it isn't airy fairy New Age spirituality. This movie is the real deal. No philosophical punches are pulled. As Harvey Keitel's character points out, we're all irrelevant ""movie extras,"" like mere plants or bugs; and yet, we humans have these strivings that eventually allow us to soar, complete and free.<br/><br/>Youth, old age, giving up, becoming re-inspired once again, beauty, the meaning of creativity, moving forward in spite of that familiar feeling all of us know all too well, that life is pointless. The film's themes penetrate one's soul to its core and they're intertwined so beautifully, in such complex ways, like life itself.<br/><br/>After watching ""Youth,"" one appreciates the basic truth that what happens to one's body, or mind, is arbitrary. Who knows why we land in a particular spot at a particular time at a particular age. But wherever we land, if we still have our youth - not ""youth"" in the sense of a certain age - but in the sense of an inspired internal state with our gifts intact and (as one character puts it) our drive to return home, we do it."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","6","25 October 2015"," Elegant, although again perhaps a bit detached
","The only other film I've seen from the director is The Great Beauty, and while I thought that was a very handsome, very visually striking film, it did nothing for me in terms of getting me emotionally invested in any way to the story. This film did, to an extent. It had me invested a bit, but then it would lose me, only to get me invested again and so on. I think as a meditation on life it works better in a way than The Great Beauty did. The performances here are nice and nuanced, with Michael Caine giving some great work late in his career. It's a refreshing film to see, simply because it is felt more than it's about anything happening with the plot. I do recommend it, although I do have reservations with it."
"mcoats-71101","2","1","2","1 October 2019"," Yawn
","Not one of Sorrentino's best - he does like his 'one central character focused, pensive, slow flowing sentimental' pieces but this one fails where others don't, mainly because he's gone down the Woody Allen route of trying to pack in as many big names and random celebs as he can at the expense of a real script.<br/><br/>Paloma Faith's appearance is nonsensical, Keitel's character sounds like his teeth are falling out, Weisz's hysterical daughter act does nothing for the film, and I don't buy anyone's relationship with each other...it all seems so contrived while trying to be clever and deep, but without any real content.<br/><br/>Michael Caine is the saving grace, his performance is superb as always but overall the script and his co-stars let him down."
"frankde-jong","8","1","2","31 July 2019"," Far more than dirty old men looking at naked young women (as the poster seems to imply)
","""Youth"" (2015) is the second film of Paolo Sorrentino about old age and decay, after ""La grande bellezza"" (2013). Both films make use of Fellini-esk extravaganza.<br/><br/>""Youth"" is an ironic title because the film is about a luxurious spa with a predominantly old clientele. Among the visitors are Mick Boyle, director of films (Harvey Keitel) and Fred Ballinger, composer of classical music (Michael Caine). Both men have different apporaches to the diminishing of their strenght and capabilities. Fred has fallen into apathy and abandons all activities. Mick is in full denial and swears that the best is yet to come. Michael Caine and Harvey Kietel both make the best out of their roles, contributing a lot to the quality of the film.<br/><br/>Around this central duo various secondary characters are circling. In this respect the film has a resemblance with ""Magnolia"" (1999, Paul Thomas Anderson), although there the central character was a man on his deathbed, a stage that Fred and Mick have not reached yet.<br/><br/>The link between old age and decay and the character of Maradona (Roly Serrano) is obvious, but there are other secondary characters for which this link to the central theme is far from obvious. I am thinking about the silent couple and the masseuse with dental braces. The story line for the central couple is wafer-thin and actually a bit banal. The storyline for the masseuse does not exist at all (despite the fact that she reappears a couple of times in the film). This way these characters are reduced to set pieces and in this respect ""Youth"" falls short of ""Magnolia""."
"blanche-2","8","1","2","9 July 2019"," Youth - it's about aging.
","Youth is a beautifully and thoughtfully made film by Paul Sorrentino - about aging. Caine and Keitel are two old men, best friends, staying in a fancy Swiss hotel for the summer.<br/><br/>Fred Ballinger (Caine) is a famous conductor/composer, now retired, and Keitel is a film director, Mick Boyle, who is working on his film while at the hotel, putting the script together with the actors who will appear in it. Ballinger's daughter (Weisz) is her father's assistant, and she is staying with him.<br/><br/>An emissary for Queen Elizabeth visits Ballinger to ask him to conduct his own composition, Simple Songs, for Prince Philip's birthday. He refuses. That portion is based on a situation with Ricardo Muti, who could not agree with the Queen on repertoire and ultimately refused to conduct a concert.<br/><br/>Michael Caine gives a great performance as a man who feels his life is over. He comes off as being much more fragile than we usually see him, even at his age. He has some very funny dialogue. Harvey Keitel is wonderful as a man going forward, feeding off the energy of the young actors with whom he is working. Rachel Weisz as Lena is heartfelt as a woman who has both anger and love for her father. I saw her on stage -
she's so stunning it's ridiculous.<br/><br/>The scenery and the music are flawless.<br/><br/>I can't say much more about this film - you either get it or you don't. It's about aging, how you choose to deal with it, love, looking back, looking forward, memories, and one other big thing - youth."

","I wonder if either Michael Caine or Harvey Keitel regrets having made this movie? One wonders what they thought of the project when proposed, and what they thought after seeing the result. I don't know about Keitel, but Caine certainly doesn't need the money, so one wonders why he signed on to such a pretentious, artsy-fartsy piece of balderdash. Unless, as I say, the project sounded different when presented. First of all, there is no coherent story line. Oh there' s plenty of family acrimony between father and daughter, and some confict between a pair of lovers splitting up, and a scenery-chewing scene between two elderly, separated show business types reaching the end sof their lives and careers. And of course the reference to homsexuality that is de rigeur nowadays. But they are presented as isolated threads with no unifying theme to draw them together. Then we have the pretentiousness. A plethora of cryptic and obscure scenes with weird stagings oddly shot, reminiscent of Fellini, are scattered throughout the film, like trash over a landscape, and make the viewer wonder just what the hell is going on at that particular moment. It wasn't quite bad enough to make me stop the film in the middle, but that is only because of the gorgeous cinematography of the Swiss landscape. Still, I wish, as they say, that I could have my two hours back."
"axapvov","5","1","2","4 February 2018"," Sorrentino believes in cinema
","At its best, ""Youth"" grabs his ideal of grandiloquence with pure cinema moments. It can get gorgeously evocative, like having an old Maradona thinking about his pre-match warm-ups. ""What are you thinking about?"", he´s asked, and he answers ""the future"". As eloquent as it can be it´s also too vague and two hours can become tedious. Maybe too sentimental as well but nostalgia is the engine after all. There´s nothing wrong in missing past times. Nothing."

Mick is with a group of writers as they are attempting to come up with a script for ""Life's Last Day"" and spend their time attempting to compose final death bed endings for the film. There are a number of minor subplots and players at the resort so you can create whatever theme or metaphor you desire for the film.<br/><br/>The film was very artsy and theme driven. It appeared to focus on dreams and desires which are best left to youth, but I am sure one could get the opposite meaning. The film has a lot of good lines that appear that they tie things together, but then fall short.<br/><br/>""I have to believe everything to make things up.""

","The story is set at an expensive Swiss health resort and it focuses, in particular, on an aging director, Mick (Harvey Keitel), and an even older ex-composer, Fred (Michael Caine). Fred seems like a man waiting to die and even though the Queen of the United Kingdom wants him to perform for her, he makes lots of excuses. His friend Mick, however, seems very active...trying to make that one great film which will be his finale.<br/><br/>The film has hardly any plot apart from two old men contemplating life and their existence. In many ways, if you like one of Ingmar Bergman's more depressing films, you essentially know what ""Youth"" is going to be like...somber, depressing, supposedly insightful and as much fun to watch as your grandmother taking a bath. Overall, a hard film to watch, let alone enjoy. Some obviously like it based on the other reviews, but I found that even though the film was made well and well acted, it was tedious and depressing. Even an incredibly beautiful and sensual nude scene wasn't enough to spark my interest in this story."

","I hope everybody has a good friend with whom he talks only of the lighter things in life and not the troublesome, profound stuff. This film is not that friend, but it is about two men subjectively at the end of their life that are this friend for each other. It is about important relationships with one another (family, friends, strangers) and oneself. These relationships form the outline of a life lived despite its inescapable death. Certainly, not every scene touches everyone the same way, but I rarely saw a movie with so much emotional backlash because of little scenes, like the conversation about riding a bike or the metaphor of the looking glass. I will remember them dearly."

","Youth is a poor film with a lousy plot and a terrific cast that deserved far better than this script. The cast is the only thing it really has going for itself if I am being honest, Michael Caine shines, as always in the lead role, he has a great back and forth with Harvey Keitel and Rachel Weisz, making their poor dialogue a lot more bearable. <br/><br/>It tries so hard to make us feel something. There are a lot of scenes that are meant to be hard hitting, dialogue that is supposed to be brutally honest, but it never gives us a real reason to feel for these characters or care for their heartache. They are all unlikeable and I felt no need to want to see them succeed. <br/><br/>As well as that, it is tonally all over the place, it jumps from intense drama to gross out comedy, it can never make up its mind on what it wants to be. The film has both an emotional monologue from Caine in which he talks about his love for his daughter and a scene where two old men watch a naked woman slowly enter a hot tub, it also has singer Paloma Faith playing herself in it. <br/><br/>All around, pure ridiculous. Ineffective in every way, Youth was not for me and I could not possibly recommend it. <br/><br/>A retired composer and his filmmaking friend reflect on their lives and the prospects of aging. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Caine / Worst Performance: Paloma Faith"

","Ahhhh, ""Youth"", if only we can all go back. Well, maybe we can't (of course this only refers to us mid-lifers and geriatrics), but at least we can satisfy ourselves a viewing of a very cerebral and insightful movie about two professional older men vacationing in an exotic grand European hotel; and that would be Writer-Director Paolo Sorrentino's ""Youth"". The film stars Michael Caine as Fred Ballinger, a retired composer who is pressured by the Queen's parliament to orchestrate one final concierto. Ballinger was famed as a composer of simple songs, but his life is not that simple. He has doubts about his urinary health, mourns about his institutionalized wife, and guilts about not providing enough attention to his daughter in his past due to his obsession with his work. Then there is Mick Boyle played by Harvey Keitel. Boyle is an aging film director who is past beyond his prime, but is working on a movie with a young group of screenwriters. Boyle plans to use his longtime actress muse Brenda Morel as the star of his movie. Sorrento delivers such a beautiful composition of Ballinger and Boyle's friendship in the picture. It was wonderful seeing them discuss so many topics that many seniors would discuss in conversation. Rachel Weisz plays Lena, Fred's daughter and assistant. Lena is going through major heartbreak as her husband has left her for a younger female pop star. Lena is devoted to her father even though she feels a bit of angst for him not being a devoted father in the past. Paul Dano comes in this picture branch as TV actor Jimmy Tree. Jimmy is at the hotel preparing for a role and takes a friendship and mentor-like liking to Fred. Tree is trying to leaves I mean leave his character stereotype of playing a robot in a popular television show. Sorrentino's movie is not for everyone, and it might take a couple of viewings to fully digest it, but his exquisite execution of ""Youth"" is timeless and beautiful to see. Sorrentino's screenplay was also a delight. Luca Bigazzi's cinematography was big and wondrous. Caine orchestrates a Caine-like performance as orchestra-maestro Fred, but what do you expect? It's Michael ""The Man"" Caine!! Keitel was adequate as Boyle but a bit outshined by his counterpart Caine. Weisz continues to give stellar performances as she does here as Lena. Oh, I need to save the Tree because Dano's simple work as Tree was also very admirable. But the ultimate scene-stealer in ""Youth"" was the legendary Jane Fonda as Brenda Morel. Wow! Fonda hit it out of the park, even though she only went to bat once; meaning her role was very brief, but very lasting. So go and live and relive ""Youth"" with a youthful viewing. ***** Excellent"

","Those that see this as bad aren't smart enough to understand it.<br/><br/>This is a very philosophical film that asks the viewer to reexamine their life and it's meaning. While the universal perspective is extremely hard to grasp, so as to see us in the clearest of light, this film asks us to reexamine that which we believe we know about ourselves. Things aren't always as they seem. I'm reminded Of Socrates: 'I only know that I know nothing.'<br/><br/>Some of the latest psychological understandings are included for one to ponder. While I'm not saying this film is the ultimate measure to which all others must be compared, it's definitely much more thought provoking than many a shallow superficial films of the day, seeking to unmask human denial for all to see.<br/><br/>This film is not perfect, nothing human can ever be so in our current time, but it's definitely a step in the right direction, for those serious about getting a better grip on understanding the human animal; topics for the thinking, which just may enlighten some, yielding a better, more fulfilled life, in the process."

You hear a band tuning up and then they start to play. Suddenly they cut to visual and the singer sings, the drummer plays.... only the singer is in focus, and they play on a rotating stage. One take and the tune continues in one take. Straight on, straight up, right on. And then cutting to Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) listening to the same tune that the band played. He seems little troubled over something... Cutting to Fred Ballinger (Sir Michael Caine) sitting in a garden being interviewed by somebody that apparently comes from the Royal Highness in Great Britain. Mr. Ballinger shows a little arrogance and fatigue with a high integrity and solid character directly. Very amusing! At the same time they focus in on a young man, Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), sitting at a table listening to the conversation between Fred Ballinger and the Queen's Emissary. A few cuts back and forth. And then suddenly a cut showing the whole garden and the young mans table is exactly centered and hiding the table between Mr. Caine and the interviewer. The whole scenery is just about perfect and my mind fly over to the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel. Fred Ballinger refuses to the Queen's desire and starts to play with a piece of plastic paper from a candy. Just by playing with the paper and the sounds from the paper you can hear the expertise from the conductor and the subtle music coming from a highly experienced conductor; the rhythm of drums and the rhythm of the whole orchestra. Mr. Ballinger's fatigue and his finished career and arrogance of the subject being brought up again and again is perfectly displayed by this simple manner... The Queen's Emissary says ""Gooday Maestro!"" and leaves. Mr. Ballinger remains silent and continues to read his paper and playing with the candy paper. Jimmy Tree gives a little nonchalant salute to the conductor (as in ""Good work, there!"") and Fred waves a little back... perfectly executed! There is so much going on directly in this movie that I just had to write this. These opening minutes is well planned, well produced, well directed, well acted and well accomplished... plain and simple great! The title of the the movie comes in after 14 minutes in a sequence that is true art. This movie is a piece of art. This movie has special moments. This movie is beautiful. You will love it, or you will hate it. And now the words will be left out for you to experience the movie.<br/><br/>Instant classic line from the movie (Jimmy Tree, Fred Ballinger, a boy and Diego Maradona speaks to each other. They talk about the fact that the boy is left handed.) Diego Maradona: ""I am also left handed!"" (instant silent moment) Jimmy Tree: ""Christ! The whole world knows you're left handed!"" Diego Maradona: ""Thank you.""<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Wonderful cinematography! Very well written day to day dialogue. Sound recording with high class. The clarity of the picture deliver the sense of art that this movie has to offer. Sometimes a little bad sound editing where you can hear the in and out fadings before and after the characters lines. (Especially about 34 minutes into the movie between Michael Caine and Rachel Weisz.) The music is magic... Academy Award Nominee! Astonishing! - The actors : Competent with depth. Mr. Keitel and Mr. Caine together brings solid performances to the screen. - The story : Interesting. Exploring a hotel little like the motion picture Grand Budapest Hotel. Two friends having reflections over life and other things such as careers. - Entertainment : Great! Piece of art speaking of cinematography and picture recording blended with quite the interesting story... and Diego Maradona! - Age : Due to nudity, I will give this opinion to parental guidance.<br/><br/>7,8 out of 10.

Michael Caine plays Fred Ballinger, a retired composer who is approached with an offer to perform for the Queen but he refuses. Harvey Keitel plays Mick Boyle, a struggling filmmaker whose final film is botched when convincing his leading actress to appear becomes problematic. Rachel Weisz plays Lena, Fred's daughter who is reconnecting with him and became his assistant. She finds romance in a poorly handled and distracting subplot regarding a climber. Paul Dano plays a struggling actor who regrets that his most notable role is playing a robot. Jane Fonda makes an appearance as the diva whom Boyle is trying to cast in his film and she delivers an icy yet blunt monologue to Boyle that is painful but true in more ways than one. Director Paolo Sorrentino was celebrated with The Great Beauty but his efforts here are uneven with numerous distracting unnecessary shots. The production values are top notch with gorgeous locations and photography, particularly during a dream sequence. Screenplay starts out well but becomes disjointed until the finale where an invitation is met nicely. Theme regards ageing and how it screws with one's memory and perception. It plays on one's self worth as Ballinger deals with his relationship with composing, and Boyle struggling with completing his life's work and roadblocks preventing him, and Lena attempting to connect with a parent.

I am also one of those who consume video products in large amounts, as a part of a generation that was born with it, and which by abhorrent use has lost the fact that movie-making is in fact an art. By watching documentaries, and reality movies, and all these ""all the same"" commercial movies, coming from all over the place, but born in Hollywood, we have lost the sense of art that stands in movies.<br/><br/>Here we have a revealing example of art making in movies. Superb. I previously watched Sorrentino's work, but none transcended the average efforts of talented film directors. I found this outstanding. The music, the film making, the scenery, the dialogue, the story, the segmentation, the outcomes, all combined in a perfect mix.<br/><br/>Video poetry."
"howard.schumann","9","1","2","10 January 2016"," A poignant meditation on youth and aging
","Filled with dream and fantasy sequences in the tradition of the great Italian director Federico Fellini, Paolo Sorrentino's (""The Great Beauty"") film Youth is a poignant meditation on youth and aging, loss and regret, love and loneliness, a gorgeous film that could easily be called ""The Great Beauty, Part 2."" Featuring seventy-something actors Michael Caine (""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") and Harvey Keitel (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") in their best performances in many years, the film takes place in an upscale spa in the Swiss Alps where two old friends reflect on their life and loves. Caine is Fred Ballinger, a retired composer and conductor who, by his own admission, is very apathetic and seems to have lost his zest for life.<br/><br/>When asked by a representative of Queen Elizabeth (Alex Macqueen, ""Cinderella"") to conduct his work ""Simple Songs"" before the Queen, he adamantly refuses but refuses to say why, other than for ""personal reasons."" His friend Mick Boyle (Keitel) is a film director traveling with a group of actors at work on his final film, ""Life's Last Day"" in which they all work feverishly on trying to find the best last line before the final credits roll. Fred and Mick talk about their life but conversation does not revolve around the eternal issues - the wonders and terrors of death, who we really are, why we are here. Rather they schmooze about the girls they regret not having sex with, the state of their prostate gland, and what they can and cannot remember about their high school sweethearts.<br/><br/>The film is also dotted with other interesting (and some bizarre) characters who are at the spa including the current Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea, ""Dom Hemingway"") who reveals the seductive power of her youthful body in a memorable swimming pool scene with Fred and Mick. To prove that she is more than her looks, she engages in an ironic conversation with Hollywood actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano, ""Love and Mercy""), whose most famous role was as a robot named Mr. Q. When Tree asks condescendingly whether she ever watches anything other than reality TV, she retorts ""I appreciate irony but not when it comes filled with poison."" When he asks why, she tells him, ""Because it reveals personal frustration... do you like what you do? I love being Miss Universe."" <br/><br/>Also present is an obese former soccer player (Roly Serrano, ""Le ciel du centaure"") who carries around an oxygen tank with him, a young masseuse (Luna Zimic Mijovic, ""Traumland"") who does unusual dance routines in her room, and a monk (Dorji Wangchuk) who meditates on the hotel grounds and is reportedly able to levitate. While the film mostly consists of unrelated vignettes, there are several dramatic high points. In one, Fred's daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz, ""The Lobster"") is brought to tears when her husband, Mick's son Julian (Ed Stoppard, ""Angelica""), leaves her for a young woman named Paloma Faith. When Mick presses him for the reason he left his wife, all he can say is that Paloma is ""good in bed."" <br/><br/>Another is where an aging actress Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda, ""This is Where I Leave You"")who Mick hired to play the lead role in his film, tells him that she will not do the film, choosing instead to act in a TV series. Her confrontation with Mick goes quickly from amiable to toxic in a few minutes that suggests the underlying shallowness of the Hollywood mentality. There is also a powerful monologue by Lena excoriating her father for being obsessed with his music, his philandering, and for never being there for her when she was growing up.<br/><br/>While the script of Youth is mundane and offers no profound message, its profundity does not come from words but from the silences between words, the beauty of the surrounding mountains and forests as shot by Luca Bigazzi, and from the sublimity of the music of David Lang including the Simple Song #3 performed by Sumi Jo, and the tender lyrics of Mark Kozelek's ""Ceiling Gazing."" Like the playful antics of Ballinger conducting the cows in a symphony of clanging bells, or the hefty soccer player kicking a tennis ball high in the air, Sorrentino lets us know that there are no age limits for a youthful spirit."
"maurice_yacowar","9","1","2","3 January 2016"," Swiss hotel/spa setting for examinations of lives
","The heart of Paolo Sorrentino's Youth lies in the lead composer Fred Ballinger's (Michael Caine) most famous work, Simple Songs. The queen will knight him if he conducts that number in a concert for her Prince Phillip. Ballinger refuses because he wrote it for his famous soprano wife Melanie to perform and she's gone. Not dead, we eventually learn, but frozen into a silent scream.<br/><br/>Ballinger is embarrassed by his fame for that simple composition, instead of all his weightier works. Sinilarly, serious actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano) is regretfully best known for his heavily costumed role as a robot in some special effects trivia. By disappearing into the robot his disappeared his serious work. <br/><br/>The film is woven out of such paradoxes. That is, it's a stab at capturing our complex reality of life. Like Ballinger's signature piece, the film is a simple story — a mixed bag of folks at holiday and rehab at a luxurious hotel/spa in Wiesel (i.e., ""pointed"") in the Swiss Alps. But everything simple is complex. <br/><br/>Ballinger feels that he can only relate to music and admits to having neglected his wife and daughter Lena. ""You were right. Music is all I understand."" But he remembers his tremors when he fell into love at first sight of Melanie. His current detachment expresses his pain rather than the apparent lack of feeling. <br/><br/>His buddy film director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) is scripting his testament film but with his screenwriters is bogged down on the ending. In his Eureka moment he will allot the deathbed speech to the dying man's wife, not him. But the film dies when that actress Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda) pulls out of the project, their 12th together over 53 years. She first explains she needs the money from a TV series she's been offered so needs to prefer. But she goes on to declare his career dead, his last films crap, in a cruel candour all offered — of course — in the name of friendship. Love and hate bubble together there.<br/><br/>In a chillingly expressive shot, on the left side of the otherwise black screen Fonda's old, veined hand talon-like caresses the sized Kettle's cheek. That's Jane Fonda's hand!?! The film is titled Youth but, paradoxically again, it's about the old, the sere not the juicy. But here youth and age are the same telescope. Through one end it's youth looking at the future in closeup. Through the other it's the past, galloping further and further away.<br/><br/>With Pamela's withdrawal, Boyle knows his project is dead but determines to start another. In his last scene with Ballinger he says ""You say that emotions are overrated. But that's bullshit. Emotions are all we've got."" On that he strides out to the balcony and jumps to his death. Shattered in guilt, Pamela runs amok in the airplane and has to be bloodily subdued. With his gesture Boyle refuted Pamela's disrespect: ""C'mon, life goes on even without that cinema bullshit."" Another ""simple song"" here — bitterly comic but sombre.<br/><br/>Sorrentino gives the film's last shot to the dead but beaming Boyle. That is, he gives the last silent word to Boyle's faith in emotion. When Ballinger conducts his simple masterpiece for the queen he tears up over its emotional force. Against Melanie's silent scream Ballinger proffers his musical articulation of his ardor. It speaks for as well as to everyone. As in the film's last ""simple song,"" over the end titles, he's in full content and out of control. <br/><br/>So the composition that seems simple but beautiful turns out resonant and profound, especially in full orchestration. That's the funny thing about life: the simple is so complex. Conversely, as the young girl compliments Tree about one off his serious films, he taught her that the big things in life are essentially simple. Everybody doesn't have a clue what they're about — so it doesn't matter. As Ballinger early told Boyle, ""Levity is also perverse."" Not here. Here the light is how we handle the heavy.<br/><br/>Hence too the tension between the intellect and the senses. The young masseuse speaks of the understanding that only touch can give. Ballinger is proud he never became an intellectual. The screenwriter scenes are a parody of literary creation. On the other hand, the sensually rich Miss Universe reveals an astonishing intelligence, dissolving that antithesis. When Boyle hires the plain looking young hooker just to walk with him, he seems to be buying an emotion not a sensation. When we see the girl's mother seeing her off to her ""job,"" Sorrentino seems to encapsulate the tradition of modern Italian cinema (as embodied by Fellini). The girl carries the neorealist exploration of poverty into the contemporary spa's opulence. <br/><br/>Another moment of historical resonance involves Tree, who is at the spa studying the people for clues to his next role. We finally learn his character when he appears in costume, freezing all the white-clad dinners — as Hitler. Tree pulls out off his project because ""I have to choose what is really worth telling: horror or desire? And I choose desire. You, each one of you, you open my eyes, you made me see that I should not wasting my time on the senseless fear."" Mutatis mutandis, that could be Pamela's reason too. As desire trumps horror both Boyle and Ballinger nurse charged memories of a childhood attraction to the same girl, unconsummated so ever fresh in their mind."
"martino-sanzovo","7","2","9","21 September 2015"," The future by Sorrentino
","Not an easy task for Paolo Sorrentino to come back 2 years after ""La Grande Bellezza"" worldwide success. True, we shall not be comparing the two movies but unfortunately this is an easy trap to fall in. Straight to the point: ""La Giovinezza"" is a good movie but not fully convincing. Sorrentino and Bigazzi's cinematography does not convince (Rome's natural set design is not there this time to ""simplify"" the job), the different supporting characters are not always functional to the story (the extremely annoying group of young screenwriters, for instance), the soundtrack is not effective as the Italian director accustomed us. On the other hand, in every scene we have Sorrentino's signature behind it (the movement of camera, the cinematic creations, etc.) and this is pure pleasure for his fans. Michale Caine offers an outstanding performance (the music director Fred Ballinger,a role that deserves an award) which alone is worth the price of the ticket. Brilliant is Maradona's alter ego and a strong performance is delivered by Rachel Weisz (Ballinger's daughter). But the relationship between the old friends Michale Caine and Harvey Keitel stands above all: a relationship so beautifully depicted which provokes a strong emotion in the viewer (emotionremember about this word) So what is the movie about? Like for every Sorrentino's movie, interpretations are multiple. ""Youth"" mainly talks about the future and how we look at the future; and it does it from the heart yet without falling into sentimentalism. A couple of hours at the movie theater for Sorrentino's works are always well invested time; just beware of few drawbacks here and there."

"Mobithailand","9","1","3","28 April 2016"," A masterpiece of film-making which will entertain and uplift you in equal measure.
","Michael Caine is yet another one of a small select group of actors who always turns in a great performance and will make any movie he appears in feel a bit special. He is now in his 80's and some of my other favourites, such as Pacino and De Niro are not too far behind in the age ranks. I'm not too sure who is going to replace them in my affections when they finally call it a day - probably no one. <br/><br/>The last Caine film I saw was the excellent Harry Browne, in which he plays an avenging, retired marine. The part suited him down to the ground. I am not convinced that Caine was perfectly cast in Youth, although the old trooper pulled out all the stops and delivered his usual blistering performance. <br/><br/>Caine was, is, and always will be a cockney. He is pretty good at American accents and he had a wonderful upper-class British accent in the film that made him - Zulu. But in Youth, Caine plays the part of a world renowned, retired maestro - an orchestral conductor on a par with Barbirolli or von Karajan. I'm sorry, but dear old Michael, however hard he tries, doesn't quite pull off the right accent. He wasn't a Malcom Sergeant - not even a Colin Davis. He tries to speak in an educated middle-class accent, but to me, his cockney strains still came through.<br/><br/>I doubt if the director, Paolo Sorrentino, who also wrote this fine movie, even realised the problem existed - after all, he's not English. I know Caine was supposed to be a bit of a rough diamond, but how rough a diamond can you be if you have lived and breathed the world of classical music for your entire life. I can't see anyone's cockney accent surviving that. But I guess it's only the English who will notice it.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay was very original and the film was beautifully made. Together with Harvey Keitel, who plays an ageing film director, Caine is holidaying at an exclusive upmarket Swiss hotel in the Alps. The hotel caters for the rich and famous where healthy food and exercise is the order of the day. We have a female British pop star (Rita Ora), a very fat Maradonna look- alike, a real Miss Universe, a high-class escort, and many more diverse characters, most of them young and beautiful.<br/><br/>Caine is visited by the Queen's equerry, who asks Caine to conduct some of his own compositions for Prince Philip's birthday. He declines - twice. Keitel is surrounded by a ragbag trio of young impecunious screenwriters who are helping him to complete his latest screenplay. The two octogenarians also have their respective son and daughter with them, who are married to each other; but the Keitel's son dumps Caine's daughter soon after the movie starts. So what are all these people really doing there and how do they interact with each other? Will Caine eventually change his mind and agree to conduct for the Queen? Will 'has-been' Keitel get his script finished and will he get the money to shoot it? Will the arrival of feisty Jane Fonda as Keitel's leading lady change anything? Then there is Caine's estranged wife - who is dying.<br/><br/>The film quite clearly has Italian roots. There's some titillating nudity and a few doses of 'rumpy-pumpy' to spice things up a bit, along with a healthy dose of surrealism and a lot of laugh out loud, witty humour. It is about two successful men at the end of their lives, thinking back to the days of their youth. It is also about the youths themselves and the intense, fleeting relationships they have with each other. It is a masterpiece of film-making and it will leave you feeling entertained and uplifted. I can't explain why - it just does.<br/><br/>My wife, who is Thai, couldn't make head or tail of what was going on, but that doesn't surprise me. She struggled mightily with the dialogue - which is at the heart of the film. In any case, there's no discernible plot in the traditional sense, it's far too Italian for that. As another IDMb reviewer has written, ""Either you love it or you get nothing from it."" <br/><br/>I loved it and my wifewell...she...(guess)"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Youth"" (2015) was a very good movie by Paolo Sorrentino. Lead actors Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel were very good, and i also loved performance by Paul Dano but it's Jane Fonda who steals scenes when she is in. Others were good as well. There were many references to famous people in this movie, which takes place in some heavenly beautiful SPA and the most obvious reference was to Diego Maradona. The movie is beautifully shoot, there are many beautiful and gorgeous locations, and the whole production seamed sometimes surreal because of that beauty. I also loved pacing of this movie, which at running time 2 h almost doesn't drag, this is a very good sign about a movie in which nothing that much really happens. Music was also fantastic, with opening and closing scenes containing great songs, superbly performed.<br/><br/>Overall, before seeing ""Youth"" i kinda thought it will be like ""mucho do about nothing"", which is basically is true, but nevertheless i highly enjoying this picture. Highly recommended."

","the new movie of Sorrentino is a beautiful ode to the process of getting old, where every shot breaths magic with the incredible cinematography. two veterans like Caine and Keitel push the movie to another level of quality, and my favorite actor of the moment, Paul Dano, shows how good he is. This is a movie about feelings, about reflection, about the past and memories. Therefore, if the Great Beauty is a masterpiece of allegories but, sometimes, assumes a very Fellinian look, this movie gives space to the contemplation and absorvation of the audience, and puts this movie, for me, in another level. Just wonderful..."
"dave-mcclain","8","1","3","26 December 2015"," Youth is fleeting, but ""Youth"" will stay with you for a long time.
","""Youth is wasted on the young."" That quote from award-winning Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw means different things to different people, fittingly, depending on a person's age. Young people may see it as just another example of being dismissed by the older generation. Older people may take the quote to mean that their mature understanding of how best to enjoy life would have done them more good in a youthful body with their entire lives ahead of them. If you think about it, the quote praises both youth and maturity. Such is also the case within the English language Italian comedy-drama ""Youth"" (R, 2:04).<br/><br/>Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel star as Fred Ballinger and Mick Boyle, two men who have been friends since they were young adults and now, in their late 70s, are vacationing at a luxurious Swiss resort hotel. For Mick, this is a working vacation. He's a legendary screenwriter and director who is spending his time at the resort working with a few young screenwriters on what he hopes will be his last great film. He's writing the film for his frequent star, Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda), and wants it to be his ""testament"" to life. Fred is a renowned classical music composer and conductor who has left his music career behind him and repeatedly refuses the requests and pleas from Queen Elizabeth II's emissary for a command performance for Prince Philip's birthday. Fred does little more than exist, try to remember the past, and wait for his days to end. Fred's assistant/daughter, Lena (Rachel Weisz), does her best to keep her father healthy and motivated, but she's harboring some old grudges – and has other problems to deal with too.<br/><br/>Throughout this film, we see the concept of youth from both sides – those who still have it and those who had it long ago and see the world differently in their maturity. Fred and Mick have conversations about getting older (increased wisdom and perspective, reduced memory and satisfactory urination, etc.), but also try to pass on some of that wisdom to their children and struggle to come to terms with some of the mistakes they made in their own youth. They also observe the other guests, both famous and anonymous, even as some of those same guests observe them right back. There's the older couple who eat dinner together every night but never speak, a Buddhist monk, the obese but still popular former soccer star (Roly Serrano), a young but wise and ambitious masseuse (Luna Zimic Mijovic), the small boy (Leo Artin) who Fred hears playing one of his old compositions on the violin, the vacationing Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea) and the hot young actor (Paul Dano) researching a new role.<br/><br/>""Youth"" is the kind of movie that some may dismiss as ""artsy"", but I call engaging and insightful. The wide variety of interesting minor characters, combined with the big developments in the lives of the major characters make for a unusual storytelling (somewhat reminiscent of 2014's award-winning ""Birdman""), but it's a plot that holds the audience's attention and pays off with some very surprising (and even shocking) moments. Along the way, we're treated to a couple realistic and beautifully shot dream sequences and plenty of great scenery, courtesy of the Swiss Alps. Not to mention a look at other kinds of beauty, owing to the fact that this movie takes place in a resort – slash – spa, with traditional (ahem) European sensibilities. And, of course, with three Oscar winners, an Oscar nominee and a Golden Globe nominee in the cast, the performances are as impeccable as you would expect. After all that, what we're left with is an eloquent meditation on youth, an earnest celebration of maturity and a subtle challenge to never let go of your passions. Youth can't be held forever, but the joys of the film ""Youth"" can last quite a while. ""A-"""

"LloydBayer","7","1","3","11 December 2015"," Both visually and narratively, Youth is a satirical take on the hardships of ageing.
","No review of Youth can be written without mentioning its striking resemblance to a Wes Anderson film. But where Anderson has found a niche in simplifying his characters, director Paolo Sorrentino's approach isn't as spoon fed. Almost entirely told through ironies and metaphors, Sorrentino uses a non-linear narrative, and contrary to what the title says, his running commentary is a satirical take on the hardships of ageing. <br/><br/>Fittingly, screen veterans Michael Cain and Harvey Keitel are in the lead and they are both excellent. Cain plays Fred Ballinger, a retired music composer/director, while Keitel plays Mick Boyle, a famous Hollywood director out to make his last great film. As best friends vacationing at a luxuries hotel in the Swiss Alps, they are both past their prime and they know it. Each struggling with personal demons, they also know that this could be their last meeting, but not before leaving behind a legacy. Along with them are a plethora of oddball characters – Ballinger's daughter and assistant Lena (Rachel Weisz) jilted by her husband for an ugly pop star, a Hollywood actor researching his provocative next role (Paul Dano), an obese soccer legend with health issues, a monk who wants to levitate, a Miss Universe out to prove that she's not just a pretty face, and a Hollywood actress too proud to remember her origins (towering performance from Jane Fonda) to name just a few. Where and how these characters fit in is up to us, the audience, and Sorrentino has an Easter egg hidden behind each of them. <br/><br/>For a multi-layered narrative, Youth can feel disjointed at times and even superficial, but that's a matter of perspective and precisely where this film shines. And although delivery from everyone is outstanding, with Cain at his stellar best, the real star of this film is cinematographer Luca Bigazzi. Every frame is perfectly composed and reminiscent of Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel . Only here it's not just about picture perfect landscapes or tightly framed close-ups. What Bigazzi does with available light and shadow is just stupendous. Nudity in particular are breathtaking moments shot with restrained taste, while conveying the ultimate sense of freedom beyond human inhibitions. Another night scene in Venice had my thoughts racing to that haunting fatality scene in Under the Skin. Likewise, there are several other scenes where the camera does a lot of the talking even when characters are mute, almost as if aping Fred's explanation of his music - ""You don't need words to understand it. It just is"".<br/><br/>More than anything, Youth is a series of powerful metaphors about friendship, love, regret, and looking back on a life that was. It's not the most moving or original, and there's barely a single plot running alongside its deliberately paced 120 minutes. Then again, it's all about perception and as art house films go, beauty is always in the eyes of the beholder."
"stinadianne","7","1","3","3 December 2015"," Abstract and dreamlike
","Italian director Paolo Sorrentino has crafted an art house film full of metaphor and overwhelming symbolism. Thank goodness that the two leads give Youth the gravitas it needs to make it's moral impressions.<br/><br/>Fred (Michael Caine) is a famous retired composer who is on vacation at a fancy resort in the Swiss Alps with his best friend Mick (Harvey Keitel). Mick is a film director who is there with a team of young screenwriters while writing his next masterpiece. When Fred is asked to come out of retirement to conduct his music for the Queen of England on her son's birthday, he and Mick begin to contemplate their age, legacies, and the passage of life around them.<br/><br/>The film is written and directed by Sorrentino (The Great Beauty) and his touch is an eccentric one, as he weaves his way through the resort and spotlights small moments by the other guests and the staff, giving a sort of outlandish Upstairs/Downstairs feeling to the movie. The guests are all rich and famous in some way (a decadently dressed couple who never speaks, a retired and extremely overweight athlete, Miss Universe, a levitating monk, etc). The staff is made up of very young and bored looking people catering to their wealthy guests in grey polos. Sorrentino is not a very traditional storyteller, and the way he jumps from one subject to another can make you forget certain plot points; by the time you get back to the main characters you might have to scramble to remember what happened with them last.<br/><br/>When Mick does something out of the blue and extremely out of character, Fred and everyone at the resort is thrown for an emotional loop. Fred's daughter, Lena (Rachel Weisz), asks him what they would talk about as friends- did he see this coming at all? Fred says they only talked about the good things, never the bad things. Begging the question, do you really know someone if you only see the lighter side of them? Is it in the darkness of our friends and loved ones that we truly get to know them?<br/><br/>Keitel and Caine have wonderful chemistry as two friends who have grown in fame and fortune together. They talk about being old, about how they were when they were young, and how the youth don't know how great they have it. The film is filled with reflection of once upon a time greatness. Mick believes he still has great movies to make while Fred is done with music and wishes to live his last days out in peace. One man refusing to accept his prime may have passed and another who is happy to let it go. Their light and humorous talks ground an otherwise detached and bizarrely structured film. Abstract and dreamlike, Youth is a study in age, wealth, fame, and best friendship."

Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine are both actors I really like and even in this movie they do a good job with their acting performances. The filming techniques are also excellent, nothing bad to say about that. The nature scenery from Switzerland are also nice to look at. So why would I rate Youth below average? Because when I watch a movie I need to be entertained, the movie has to have an interesting story, a story well told. And even for drama's that are not necessary my thing the story has to be interesting, and sometimes it is. But with Youth I didn't get anything of that.

They are both wonderful and although there is a lot of separate screen time of the two, the film is about as much as Fred (Caine) as it is about Mick (Keitel). The story of Fred's daughter who is married to Mick's son is also explored. Throughout this beautifully captured film are the involving stories. The poster image for this is in the movie and to me, it is such an intense scene. I almost had to cover my eyes! I'm not going to give away much else other than that. It goes beyond much more. The supporting cast is wonderfully played by Rachel Weisz and Paul Dano. There is a standout performance by Jane Fonda who shows up only towards the end. It is not what I expected, if there were any expectations at all. I have seen the trailer before, and although to me it is misleading, it was not so in a disappointing way. Not at all. Some of the best films come at a surprise. This one came from out of nowhere for me! The direction and cinematography are brilliant! The style of the film somewhat reminded me of last year's Academy Award Winning Birdman, but it further reminded me of Terence Malick's films. If you've seen one of them, you'll know what I am talking about. It is absolutely stunning. It is directed beautifully by Paolo Sorrentino, who also directed a film from two years ago called The Great Beauty. I haven't seen that one yet. It is refreshing that he does not shy away from nudity, which there is a lot of in this film. Some may be put off by that, but I thought it was tastefully done. What an outstanding film.

The composer has to deal with various personal problems as well as a request to perform for the Queen of England.<br/><br/>The film mainly succeeds on the basis of its performances. Caine is excellent as usual as the composer, while Harvey Keitel does well as a director at the end of his tether. However, the stand out of the cast is Rachel Weisz, who plays Caine's daughter, jilted by her husband, the son of Harvey Keitel's character. Weisz captures her character's pain and sense of betrayal and should have earned an Oscar nomination for her role.<br/><br/>Although she has received critical acclaim for her role, Jane Fonda's performance is rather weak. Her character is a one note Hollywood actress on the outs with Keitel, and her appearance is little more than a cameo.<br/><br/>The main problem besetting Youth is its at times weak writing. The film is overly pretentious, relying too much on quirky set pieces and dream sequences rather than on character development. Keitel's character in particular goes in a direction that the script does not set up at all. Luckily, the strong acting makes up for the faults in the writing."

","All the reviews are very good and well thought out. I watched this film oblivious to the director's filmography. That being said, the best film for that depicts loss of youth is by far, Venus, with Peter O'Toole. I rest my case.<br/><br/>If I had to pick 2 priceless scenes in Youth: Jane Fonda's teeth reflected on a knife blade and the dark dreamy introduction of Michael Caine arriving in Venice at night. Perfect Venetian surreal cinematography.<br/><br/>The setting, a spa at high altitude, is the subconscious. This was one long Freudian psychotherapy session.

","""Youth"" is a movie that was released very recently and was written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino. He did some television and short film work since his Oscar win for ""La grande bellezza"", but this one here is his return to full feature films. It runs for slightly over 2 hours, slightly under without the closing credits and stars Michael Caine as the main character. With people like Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano and Jane Fonda, this film is a lot more Hollywood heavy than everything he has done before except maybe ""This Must Be the Place"". The title ""Youth"" is certainly an ironic one as this film, just like his previous project, is a lot about aging and life in its last chapter. This should come as no surprise as Caine is in his 80s and Keitel in the second half of his 70s.<br/><br/>All in all, this film was pretty much what I expected. Caine was good from start to finish and I usually like him. Keitel I am usually not so big on and maybe that is also why I found his story not too interesting. As a whole, the film has some moments during which it drags and it's also on the fine line between artistry and pretense. In my opinion, they could have certainly kept it at around 100 minutes if they had gotten rid off some of the scenes I found rather dragging. Then again, maybe accidentally, they would have cut out some of my favorite scenes and that would have sucked. There were certainly a couple really good moments in here, especially in terms of writing and in terms of Caine's delivery. I liked the scene when he admits that he is only good in terms of music, not in terms of giving essential advice to his daughter. Brutal truth, but there was something pretty raw and authentic to that confession.<br/><br/>Sorrentino always has his very unique take on female characters and how they are perceived through men's eyes. And a character like Weisz' was not there in ""The Great Beauty"", so it's nice to see Sorrentino trying to develop in new areas. I also liked how the concert was used as a way for Caine in order to deal with the pain of losing his wife, which was certainly still there, but also in a way of saying goodbye and not shutting out this great opportunity because of his loss. There are a couple funny moments, but these are at their best when they are subtle, not really when they are talking about the quantity of their urine that morning. All in all, it is probably a film that will appeal more to older audiences than to younger ones, but by no means it's a must-watch for older audiences or a non-watch for younger ones. Especially Caine fans should check this one out as he, once again, shines in here. However, the awards attention for Jane Fonda (what are you thinking Globes???) is a bit of a joke mildly speaking. Overall, a decent watch and I recommend it."
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","5","8 November 2015"," Is Sorrentino a one-trick pony?
","YOUTH is Sorrentino's much-anticipated follow-up of the Academy winner THE GREAT BEAUTY (2013), an English-speaking ensemble piece set in a posh resort in the Swiss Alps. Fred Ballinger (Caine) is a retired music maestro, he is on vacation with his best-friend-cum-in-law, Mick Boyle (Keitel), an esteemed woman's director brainstorms with his group of screenwriters for his final testimony, an ambitious work tailor-made for the prestigious actress Brenda Morel (Fonda), who is discovered by Mick over half-a-century ago.<br/><br/>Fred and Mick are friends since childhood, but now both reaching 80, their world-view cannot be more different, Fred is relentlessly apathetic towards his work, he refuses multiple times to the request of Queen Elizabeth to perform his most famous piece ""Simple Songs"" for Prince Philips' anniversary, and rebuffs a proposal to write his memoir and asks to be forgotten by the world. While Mick, still enthusiastically integrates with his writer-quintet to finalize the script of his swan-song, a supposed masterpiece for the audience. Yet the two pair harmoniously with their daily pee competition and jostle for memories of their past.<br/><br/>There are other characters, Lena (Weisz), Fred's daughter, experiences a one-sided breakup from Julian (Stoppard), Mick's son, who leaves her for Paloma Faith, the real-life British pop star (whose CGI music video is just too surreal even in for a Sorrentino's production). Paul Dano plays Jimmy Tree, a young actor eternally acknowledged by his most popular role, a robot, and prepares for a new role as Adolf Hitler, which will examine the real driving force that propels him to strive in the business. Also, the overweight Maradona (Serrano), a new Miss Universe (Ghenea), a young masseuse (Mijovic) and a mountaineering coach (Seethaler), all leaves their inkings in the narrative.<br/><br/>But is Sorrentino's ostensibly life-contemplating poshness makes him an auteur of our times? The answer is moot at present, one might be too cynical to call him a poseur, but I suppose an outstanding tableaux artisan is more appropriate right now, no one can deny the imposing beauty of his artsy compositions of his shots and the exalted gratification of his ear-friendly music preferences, yet, as a screenwriter, his dialogue is either cliché-laden or overtly vying to be a dictum, all the best parts are those without words, apparently English language and narrative is really not his strongest suit.<br/><br/>Headlining a glamorous cast, Caine restrains a poised existence against the world around him, his frosty side only breaks down near the end, after the suicide accident (which pales in comparison with IDA 2013 in the same abrupt fashion), and his eventual compromise betrays a tough man/husband/father's unwilling resignation of his conviction. Keitel has always been a character actor wanting a certain gradation of versatility, his two-hander with Fonda tellingly proves that, he is barely able to retort back in the assumed tit-for-tat show-piece which serves as their Oscar-bait, however his last line is greatly moving ""emotion is everything"", eventually he is a martyr for his belief, after the fatal betrayal and he lets his emotions to reign over his life for the last time.<br/><br/>It is easy to understand why Jane Fonda is hyped for an Oscar nomination here, she plays a two-times Oscar-winning diva, basically a larger-than-life version of herself (or is it?) with ridiculously heavy make-up, it is the most showy performance among the cast, but frankly, it is a five-minutes cameo, can she pull off a Beatrice Straight in NETWORK (1976, 8/10)? I highly doubt that will happen, as much as I want to see Fonda back in the Oscar podium, it is a long shot, but one plus side is that her role is right in the target for Oscar voters, a coattail nomination might not be a far-fetched dream. As for Weisz and Dano, doesn't have enough fodder to be the showstopper here.<br/><br/>Sorrentino is a smart filmmaker, who plumps for stories about the privileged class, where Academy voters clearly belong, and making them feel relevant and contented about the fading memories, about getting old, about mundane pettiness and about nostalgia, without being perceptively incisive, that's why he has succeeded with THE GREAT BEAUTY, YOUTH unwittingly exposes him as a one-trick-pony, the second round is less admirable, but still passable to watch, yet I cannot say for sure for a third time, let's wait and see if I am right or wrong, and I do hope there will be a quantum leap to prove I am wrong."
"lucasversantvoort","6","1","7","18 November 2015"," Too stylized for its intended emotional impact
","Director Sorrentino has become somewhat of a household name since his Il Grande Belezza strolled through awards season in 2013. Now, two years later, his new film Youth graces theatre screens everywhere. As the title suggests, it deals with 'youth', though wasted youth is the better term. All the action takes place in and around a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps, as we see two old men coming to grips with their pasts and desires.<br/><br/>Composer Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) are spending their holiday--as always--in this resort. They are not the only residents: Ballinger's daughter and assistant Lena (Rachel Weisz); actor Jimmy Tree, who in Birdman-esque fashion is only remembered for one mediocre role; a couple that never communicates; a young boy who loves Ballinger's violin pieces, etc. They're also told Miss Universe will be arriving soon.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the reasons the film maintains some semblance of momentum. Rachel Weisz and Jane Fonda shine in their short but intense scenes. Michael Caine is also quite good, though I always watch him with a certain emotional distance. Nevertheless, he is very good in the scene where he explains to the Queen's ambassador why he won't conduct his Simple Songs.<br/><br/>Sorrentino deliberately paces the film quite slowly to portray the boredom and routine of the resort, how these people are basically sitting around with only their memories keeping them company. We get variations on these themes: Caine's relationship with his daughter, Keitel's relationship with his son and his desire to make a new film, Dano's fear he'll forever be remembered for something insignificant, a role in which the audience couldn't even see his face (aka who he really is). Sorrentino alternates slow-moving scenes with emotional outbursts, such as the short scene with Jane Fonda and Rachel Weisz's monologue. Because these outbursts are framed by slow-paced scenes, the emotional impact is increased. On the other hand, the stylized nature can slow things down to a crawl. Some of the dialogue can also be as subtle as a brick to the face. When the Dano character completes his character development, he utters the following: ""I have to choose, I have to choose what is really worth telling: horror or desire? And I choose desire. You, each one of you, you open my eyes, you made me see that I should not be wasting my time on the senseless fear..."" This couldn't be more devoid of subtlety had Michael Bay written it.<br/><br/>My feelings on Youth can be summed up by watching the final scene. I won't say what happens exactly, but it involves an opera singer. She has a wonderful voice, but occasionally employs these hand gestures for added emotional effect, yet it just comes across as mannered. That's this film in a nutshell: there's plenty of content, but the film's stylized nature and deliberately plodding pace tend to undermine the emotional impact. It could've burst to the surface a bit more often."

","This is not an objective review. I am only expressing feelings I had watching the film and that stayed with me for a while afterwards.
I want to talk about Melanie (Fred's wife). There were so many themes explored throughout the movie. The most captivating for me was the subtle build up throughout the movie to Fred's wife fate. Even in the scene towards the end of the film when we first see her, we know only so little. Fred starts talking to her, we see her from away. And little by little the camera moves and we see the true state of her face, the terror in her eyes, the million screams that she is producing inside of herself. We see her face once again during the last recital of the ""Simple Songs"". Which makes her a symbol, in which all the aches and harsh realities explored so far can be expressed.<br/><br/>We know from Lena (Fred's daughter), from a previous scene, the type of life this woman was living, the sacrifices she was doing. Wasting the good years of her life knowing that her children have no one but her, while her husband is completely absent. She experienced unbearable ""anguish"" during her life.<br/><br/>But all of that is one thing and being in that final state of hers is completely terrifying. What despair and hopelessness she must be feeling? One automatically assumes that people in such state are not fully conscious or feeling a peaceful sadness. What if she is completely conscious. I keep thinking about Paloma Faith's horrifying screaming scene in the airplane and that a much worse screaming and feeling of terrible anxiety is happening inside Melanie's head. I was completely brought to a state of terror from the thought of what is going inside her mind."

","At a luxurious spa in the Swiss mountains, two long-time septuagenarian friends reflect on their lives, aging, and what comes next. One is a retired British composer/conductor (Michael Caine); the other is an American film director (Harvey Keitel) working on a new film project with a group of young actors. ""Youth"" is directed by Paolo Sorrentino and is an Italian/Swiss/French/British co-production.<br/><br/>The themes of sadness and disappointment are reflected not only in those who are in the later stages of life; even successful younger people show regret such as a young film star played by Paul Dano. While the average viewer might feel a sense of envy and curiosity of how the rich and famous live, the various characters who show up remind us that the wealthy can be as dysfunctional and unhappy as the rest of us despite their great resources.<br/><br/>Sorrentino's directing is as compassionate, sweet, and melancholy as it was in ""The Great Beauty"". There are many visual moments that are striking and bizarre (sometimes too bizarre) which add much feeling to the film. His use of the Swiss scenery is also breathtaking. (In this way, the film is similar to ""Clouds of Sils Maria"", also about a successful performer needing nourishment while staying near Swiss mountains.)<br/><br/>The unusual camera and sound work during a climactic scene at the end created great impact with their uniqueness. The music by David Lang is also ethereal. (Be sure to stay for the closing credits for this reason.)<br/><br/>Caine and Keitel do great work as the main characters and the anchors of the film. But it is scenes including others which had the strongest impact.<br/><br/>One such scene involves Rachel Weisz as Caine's daughter and his personal manager. In this particular scene, she expresses grave disappointment in her father's past behaviour.<br/><br/>The other major scene involves Jane Fonda as a septuagenarian ex-superstar with whom the Keitel character has worked in the past. In this scene, Fonda chews the scenery as a vile ex-diva. The scene was so good, it left me disappointed that her role had not been bigger. It was too brief. It made me yearn for the era when she was frequently given more substantial movie roles.<br/><br/>""Youth"" is a sweet film that attempts to explore the deeper themes of life. It doesn't fully succeed with this ambition but it goes just far enough to be a worthwhile movie experience."

As for the main roles, I'd like for Fred and Mick to spend more time together. I love the time that Fred spends with Lena. Dano is hit and miss. His best is with the little girl. I would have love to be told that it was Maradona right from the start. I'm not a soccer fan and I wouldn't know him even if he's not obese. This is definitely a movie with its own style.

","Vacationing in this Swiss Alps with a film director friend, a retired music composer starts to reevaluate his life when asked by a messenger from the Queen of England to orchestrate one of his iconic works once more in this somewhat ironically titled film. Full of dreamy cutaways to the naked bodies of those staying at the same resort, as well as some near surreal nighttime shots, 'Youth' is a stylish film through and through and bits and pieces of the dialogue are pretty good, with an inspiration versus fermentation exchange standing out most. The story at hand is, however, far from encapsulating with the lethargic pacing eliminating any sense of urgency, and then there is the fact that Harvey Keitel's ageing filmmaker character is actually more interesting that Michael Caine's composer, though Paul Dano surprisingly enough trumps them both with a heartfelt turn as a film actor depressed over the fact that has been stereotyped ever since playing a single role in a film that he considers mediocre at best. He has two of the film's best scenes as he unsettles everyone by dressing as Hitler for breakfast one day and as he encounters a young girl who has actually seen one of his lesser known performances. Caine certainly has his own strong scenes (conducting a chorus of cows) but hardly that high an amount for a protagonist. With strong supporting turns from the likes of Rachel Weisz and Paloma Faith, amusingly playing herself, this is a hard film not to recommend, but it is certainly an example of movie that sounds much better on paper."

","Michael Caine never fails to surprise me. He's one of the most accomplished actors of all time and yet, a performance like his in Youth, is still quite astonishing.<br/><br/>Caine, like a few other elder actors who I won't name, still do quite a few movies these days. But some can clearly be seen as ""paycheck"" movies. Now, I've never seen a bad performance from Caine, actually I'm not sure if he's ever had a below average performance, but sometimes he takes roles that just don't seem to make much sense. I enjoy the Now You See Me movies for what they are, but there's no real reason for Caine to be in them.<br/><br/>With that said, Youth is as good as I've seen Caine in years. It's a starring role with layers of emotion and character depth, which is something Caine just hasn't been given of late. The film itself has its beautiful moments, but Caine was the reason I was invested. He plays a retired composer, Fred, who is being sought out by the Queen for a performance of one of his most beloved songs, only personal reasons get in his way. But the film isn't really about that performance at all. In fact, it's really a story about regret, wistfulness, and deprivation.<br/><br/>Fred spends his time reflecting on his life at a secluded resort in the Swiss Alps with his longtime friend and film director, Mick, played by Harvey Keitel. These conversations give the film a poignantly nostalgic feel, but it's also not an overwhelmingly depressing take on life either. Neither actor has been this invested in a role in years, and thus it's a bittersweet film, especially considering the age and career path of both the actors in real life.<br/><br/>The one thing that didn't work too well for me was the use of dream- like sequences to hammer home the main themes and ideas. I got the message I needed through the actors and script, so I wasn't a huge fan of Paolo Sorrentino continuously using this storytelling method. Alas, the rest of his directing job should be commended.<br/><br/>Even though most of the film consists of the main characters going through their daily motions and routines, I found the message of doing something with your life and not wasting time to be incredibly effective. Some memories wash away but the ones that stick are truly the important ones. Youth was really a nice little film that was largely lost in the shuffle with the rest of the industry.

"dlovingu","10","0","2","6 September 2016"," A Powerful Movie of Exceptional Value
","Sorrentino has successfully directed a masterfully written, and masterfully executed, work of art which recommends to us a life in which all accomplishments, be they experienced ""in youth"" or ""in old age,"" are valued for their contribution to the whole. <br/><br/>Because it appears that many who have commented on this movie have missed the advantage of its insights, I will be more specific for the sake of those who have not yet seen it.   <br/><br/>YOUTH is masterfully organized. Far from being a chaos of disjointed scenes and character sketches, every event and every character in this movie contributes insight into this single theme: If not properly integrated into our present life experience, the meanings which we impute to our past experience, relative to our present, can interfere with our continuing to live a fulfilling life.   <br/><br/>We see in numerous examples throughout the movie that Michael Caine's character had come to terms with his present life as a retired conductor, but he had to learn a few more lessons to remove the blocks which were impediments to his present fulfillment. In the many other scenarios dealing with this same problem, we are shown how characters are allowing their past to intrude into their present in ways which block their present fulfillment.   <br/><br/>Many of the scenarios in YOUTH, as the title connotes, involve the refusal to recognize the value of our present attributes and to cling excessively to ones which we fear we either have lost or might lose as we grow older. It is the nature of human experience that, regardless of age, we want to feel that we are respectable, that we have led–and continue to lead–lives that are worthwhile. We differ in terms of the particular attributes and accomplishments which we regard as respectable and worthwhile, but we all share in this desire to have such attributes and accomplishments. The Caine character is seen to steadfastly refuse to ""re-live"" or dwell upon the accomplishments of his youth. He refuses to perform the song for which he is most famous, he refuses to write an autobiography, which would dwell upon the accomplishments of a life that, to him, is past. He hears words of wisdom from the mouth of a young man in violin practice who is playing Caine's ""Simple Song"" and is given the reassurance he needs to recognize that this is not a song of which he should be ashamed. In re-defining this past accomplishment he reintegrates it into a whole life which is fulfilling to him both ""then"" and ""now.""   <br/><br/>The lesson is further extended in the character played by Harvey Keitel. He persisted in his conviction that he must continue to be the one he was, the outstanding movie director. When he cannot demonstrate that he has all of the capabilities that he had in his youth, he loses his will to live. We see the character played by Jane Fonda desperately trying to be the star she always was, even while telling the Keitel character that he is not the director he always was. Her message destroys them both, as she realizes all too late that, after all, she loves him for what he is, not just for what he was. This is the lesson in its most graphic iteration.   <br/><br/>There are many other scenarios played out among the characters in YOUTH, all illustrations of this same need to integrate and value what we have been, what we are, and what we shall be in a way that harmonizes rather than impedes the flow of life. I urge the viewer to look at all of these with an eye toward recognizing the message implicit in each one–there are no superfluous incidents in this movie. <br/><br/>Although YOUTH focuses on the problem of harmonious integration in the context of aging and the desire on the part of some to retain the attributes of youth even when no longer of a youthful age, this problem is not restricted to the old and does not always involve aging. It is a problem involving self esteem, which can and does occur in many other contexts. By showing us how a variety of characters address the same problem, their need to feel good about themselves IN THE PRESENT, YOUTH provides some insight into the likely outcome of the different approaches to this universal need. <br/><br/>We see that failure to address this need in a healthy manner interferes with our living lives which are–and which CONTINUE TO BE–fulfilling.<br/><br/>Ten Stars that are well deserved."

Gorgeous landscapes and beautifully constructed scenes showcase the characters fragility. The film is beautifully paced, like a gentle octogenarian afternoon. Lovely support from Paul Dano and Jane Fonda as two American film stars, he quietly intellectual, and her brash and monstrous. It's the performances that really make this film tick but add the landscapes and the wonderful music (David Lang), and you have something very charming indeed.<br/><br/>Slow. Ponderous, even. But charming and played to perfection. Highly recommended."

","This one left me emotionally confused. I tried to make sense of how I felt and why I felt this way but eventually surrendered to the fact that sometimes you have to let some emotions sink in without passing them through your mind's filter. As Harvey Keitel's character (Mick Boyle) puts it, ""emotions are all we've got."" The two old friends, Keitel and Caine, look back at their rich and seemingly glamorous lives trying to make sense of how things turned out to be. Their attempts to assign meaning to past events and relationships fail when they realize that everything is slipping through their fingers (their memories and their youth), and all they're left with are emotions.<br/><br/>Paolo Sorrentino is known for his penchant for the visual. Youth's story line and underlying themes are visually narrated with some stunning image-music choreography.<br/><br/>Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel and Jane Fonda (in this startling cameo) all take the imminent decay of the characters they are playing to the heart and deliver some heart-wrenching performance."

I now know what he means - if you can't get your youth back, the next best thing, perhaps the first step, may be seeing this film.

","Paolo Sorrentino continues to create exquisite works of art, and Youth is his latest offering. Retired orchestra conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and over-the-hill film director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) vacation to a luxury hotel in the Swiss Alps, where they postulate love and loves lost. The scenery is charming and the camera-work skilled. The supporting performances are strong, especially that of Paul Dano, who is putting a nice little career together.<br/><br/>The dialogue, primarily self-indulgent male existential crisis, regret, missed sexual exploits, and cultural critique, is both serious and satire. Softly floating around the edges of life's larger questions, it finds comfort in the minutiae, imparting wisdom gently without taking itself too seriously. Youth is an honest portrayal of how shallow and simple man is, regardless of station, exposing his insecurities and shortfalls in a funny, intelligent, and beautiful way."

","Is the fact that I immensely liked 'Youth' a sign that I am getting old? I can tell you (and I will tell you) a few good reasons 'Youth' is not a masterpiece, and yet, I resonated and was really moved at several moments while watching this film.<br/><br/>Take for example the scene when the emissary of Her Majesty comes for a second time to invite retired composer and conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) to perform at the anniversary of Prince Phillip a famous composition of his called 'Simple Songs' ('it's the only music he likes'). The daughter of the musician, Lena (Rachel Weisz) is present and the camera moves so that she turns from background to close-up. We will understand the scene by her emotions. The old musician has refused firmly the invitation 'for personal reasons'. The emissary royally insists and asks details about the reasons. The daughter understands, she is on the verge of breaking into tears. The old man answers 'my wife is the only one who was performing it perfectly and she cannot do it any longer'. Close up on the daughter crying. One of the most beautiful declarations of love that I have seen on screens for many years.<br/><br/>The location of the story is a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, a place of relaxation and recovery for the ultra-riches of the world. Some of the scenes that describe the daily life of the place look like a tourism promo, but there is enough irony to balance the super-aesthetic view. In the mid of the hinted celebrities, in between a cinema star that can be a Matt Daemon or a Leonardo DiCaprio refueling and a Maradona at the pick of his overweight decline, we meet the two old friends - the musician and film director Harvey Keitel who tries to find an ending to his 'testament movie' together with a team of yuppies script-writers. The two share memories - remembered and forgotten - as well as an attitude that tries to cope with their own personal decay. Is this a symbol of a broader decay, the one of the society they come from, the falling in oblivion of a way of life, but also of a way of making art and relating to art? This is one of the possible messages that I read in this film.<br/><br/>The acting of the two old masters - Caine and Keitel is superb. Jane Fonda makes one apparition that is worth waiting for. There are a lot of funny moments in this film, there is melodrama, and real drama. A feeling of melancholy envelops all the story, the same type of melancholy that I sensed in The Great Beauty (which I liked less) and to some extent in This Must Be the Place which was one of the most original Holocaust stories that I have seen. Overall, 'Beauty' confirms the huge talent of Paolo Sorrentino in making films with emotional stories and characters that are both special and sometimes eccentric, but also deeply human."

","Old friends, music maestro Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and film director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel), vacation at a luxury hotel in the Alps and just talk about life, death, old age, youth and their kids. Both are up there in age and reflect mostly on their youth and things they remember and things they cannot remember. Queen Elizabeth sends and emissary to Fred as the Queen wants Fred to perform something called Simple Songs as a birthday present for her husband, Prince Phillip. Fred says he is retired and won't do it. <br/><br/>What you will see in here are numerous scenes that have nothing to do with the plot mostly because there is no plot. Now to be fair, we do enjoy the banter between Fred and Mick and we see that after all these years of friendship some secrets are revealed and with humor.<br/><br/>Even though we are reminded of Seinfeld shows where everything is about nothing we see that Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel perform probably at their best ever. Yes, we keep waiting for something to happen but after a time we resign ourselves to believing nothing will happen and actually look forward to those meaningless scenes at the hotel. Some scenes we do remember: We see nudity in Saunas, and at the outdoor pool where Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea) bathes in the nude; a symphony of cows and noises in nature conducted by Fred; a Masseuse played by Luna Zimic Mijovic who prefers touching to talking; a child comes up to Fred and spouts that no one is up for being a parent or being an adult and we cannot prepare for either. But perhaps the most memorable scenes show a man and a woman eating but never talking to each other. Fred and Mick bet on if this couple will talk, and they never do, but then on a walk in the woods Fred and Mick see that couple going at it with the woman screaming in delight and we see Fred pay Mick. <br/><br/>Then there are scenes as beautiful depictions of art, but we really cannot describe them as they go by too fast. We have the feeling the director puts these scenes in for his family and friends.<br/><br/>Notables: Paul Dano as Jimmy Tree an actor who watches people at the hotel to prepare for an acting gig later on. Jane Fonda as Brenda an actress that Mick needs for his new movie. Rachael Weisz as Lena, Fred's daughter who is jilted by Mick's son.<br/><br/>But everything reverts back to Youth. Fred says, "" I've grown so old without understanding how I got here."" The doctor asks, ""Do you know what awaits you after you leave here?"" Fred says, ""No."" The Doctor replies, ""Youth."" Make of that what you will as we may center on memories of our youth even though we do not remember everything, but do remember certain bits very clearly. <br/><br/>The most wonderful and astounding thing about this movie is the cinematography with picturesque Alps mountain scenes that we wish we could take with us for all time. I say this because there is no plot so enjoy the scenery, and the philosophies of life, death, old age, youth and loneliness. Ha!<br/><br/>There is no plot, but this is still a comfortable viewing even though we don't understand all of it. And at the end we will hear what those Simple Songs sound like.

","Review: What a brilliant movie! The acting is great from the whole cast and the chemistry between Keitel (Mick Boyle) and Caine (Fred Ballinger) is realistic and quite sweet. Rachel Weisz, who plays Fred's daughter, Lena and Paul Dano (Jimmy Tree) put in unique and emotional performances which made this film a joy to watch. The whole movie is based on a unique and elegant holiday resort, at the foot of the alps, we're the rich and famous go to get away from there day to day hectic life's. Fred Ballinger is a famous conductor, who has recently lost his wife and has decided not to conduct anymore, even though the Queen wants him to perform his most popular piece for her birthday. His close friend, Mick Boyle, is on the resort working on a script with his team of writers and actors, so when he's not writing, he meets up with his close friend so they can catch up on there day to day activities. Fred's daughter, Lena, stays with her father because her husband has left her and she still feels bitter after loses her mother. Jimmy Tree, who is a famous actor and is taking time out before he stars in a big budget picture, playing Hitler. Lena soon falls for a rock climber who is also staying on the unique resort, and Mick becomes depressed after the leading character in his masterpiece, Brenda Morel, (Jane Fonda) pulls out of the movie and tells him some home truths about his career. Meanwhile, Fred is slowly coming out of depression, after losing his wife, and he finally decides to put on the performance of a lifetime for the queen. Its a really touching story about being elderly and close friendships. The witty script was brilliant and the whole look and feel of the film was unique and very well put together. It certainly didn't feel like it was over 2 hours long and you can't help feeling emotional about the individual characters, who are all going through a midlife crisis of there own. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and I honestly think that it didn't get the recognition that it deserved. Great!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although this movie only made a $2million profit at the box office, I honestly think that it would have made much more if it got a major release. Keitel and Caine definitely should have got some awards for there performances and the cinematography was out of this world. Anyway, this movie was written and directed by Italian born, Paolo Sorrentino, 46, who directed This Must Be The Place, starring Sean Penn and Rio, I Love You, which also starred Harvey Keitel. Most of his movies have been for an Italian market, so he isn't known worldwide but he has certainly proved that he has a unique style which is needed in Hollywood today. He definitely got the most out of the actors/actresses and there were some touching scenes which were quite emotional. The way that the movie ended, with the intense music conducted by Caine, was brilliant finishing touches on a great movie and it must be one of Caine's best performances for some time.<br/><br/>Budget: $13million Worldwide Gross: $15million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/comedies starring Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Paul Dano, Rachel Weisz, Jane Fonda, Alex Macqueen, Madalina Diana Ghenea and Loredana Cannata. 8/10"

","Italian writer/director Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo, The Great Beauty, This Must Be the Place, etc) is known for his wispy, experimental films in which he dissects the concepts of love, beauty, meaning, significance, art and the manner in which they interact and influence each other. One line (of many great lines) from the movie sums up the message of YOUTH: 'I want to tell about your desire, my desire. So pure, so impossible, so immoral. But it doesn't matter because that's what makes us alive.' Filmed in the grandeur of the Swiss Alps, the cinematography by Luca Bigazzi and especially the musical score by David Lang add to the mesmerizing theme of age – youth being attainable only to the dreamers and the young of heart. <br/><br/>A retired orchestra conductor/composer Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) is on holiday with his daughter Lena (Rachael Weisz) and his film director best friend Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) in the Alps when he receives a visit from an Emissary (Alex Macqueen) from Queen Elizabeth II who invites him to perform his 'Simple Songs' at the request of Queen Elizabeth II to perform for Prince Philip's birthday. Fred refuses – he is retired and there are personal reasons for not wanting the 'Simple Songs' performed (one of the many threads that weave the mystery of aging and memory). Mick, on the other hand, is busy writing his testament – his magnum opus of a film, aided by a strange claque of young writers: the film's production depends on Mick's old friend Brenda Morel (Jane Fonda) starring in the major role. It is the interaction of these two aging artists, observed closely by an actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano), and their dissolving into the beauty of the alps scenery that brings surprises an a satisfying conclusion to this daydream of a film<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, the pacing is slow (like aging) and the musical score is stunning. This is a film that appeals to the intellect as well as the eye and is such a refreshing respite from the clangor of the current films before us today. Relax into this dream state and feel refreshed."
"bandw","9","0","3","16 May 2016"," Uniquely cinematic
","Director Sorrentino has been accused of being ostentatious in displaying his talents. In the case of this movie I say that if you've got it, flaunt it. Sorrentino utilizes all of the potential of movies--music, sound, cinematography, acting, and dialog--to create a satisfying whole.<br/><br/>The story is of two aging professionals on vacation at a resort in the Alps. One of the two is a retired composer and conductor and the other is a currently active movie director. The conductor/composer is Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and the movie director is Mike Boule (Harvey Keitel). The Alpine resort itself is a major character and a feel for the place comes from short takes, like a brief glimpse of a row of bodies sunning themselves, people lining up for a sauna, or nightly stage shows. While Sorrentino has his own style, it is clear he has taken some pointers from Fellini. There is a dreamlike quality to many of the scenes. I never know who deserves credit for such effective camera work, beyond the director and cinematographer there is probably a whole team to thank. Anyway, Sorrentino has a feel for the medium that I find most pleasing.<br/><br/>Music plays a significant role, befitting Ballinger's profession. There are some elegantly choreographed scenes. Luna Mijovic plays a masseuse at the resort and I was captivated by every scene she was in. She does some dynamic interpretive dance numbers--the scene that ends with her crossing her arms across her chest as the music fades is beautifully done. The final scene that has soprano Sumi Jo, violinist Viktoria Mullova, the BBC Concert Orchestra, and the Berlin Radio Choir preforming Ballinger's Simple Symphony #3 is a real knockout--it alone makes the movie worthwhile. I backed up and watched that scene several times. The original score by David Lang is impressive. Most movies about a fictional composer usually have some generic compositions, such as ""Mr. Holland's Opus,"" but Lang's score adds some real depth here.<br/><br/>The main focus of the story is on Fred Ballinger. Initially, by his own admission, he is a disengaged spectator of life, essentially serving his time until the end. But he cannot ignore his innate appreciation of sound. First it is the sounds a candy wrapper makes when rolled between a finger and thumb. Then it is cowbells and cows mooing in a meadow, and then a young lad at the resort playing his violin. Finally he is reengaged as a conductor in the final scene. I found that following Ballinger's gradual reawakening to be moving.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good. It's nice to see the two old pros Caine and Keitel in good form as well as a strong cameo performance by Jane Fonda. The prostate jokes could have been cut as an improvement."

The manner in which Sorentino used light, focusing it just on the person in absolute darkness might be inspired by Carravagio and baroque painting - a metaphor of hope, but also of the death, according to general belief that at the moment of one's death light is to be seen. Also the eternal question of the meaning of existence (life, work, creativity, success, marriage, children, friendship, love), which becomes more often with ages, is emphasized in the nice way. The unexpected reversal at the end, the man who was enthusiastic about the future in his old age loses hope and commits suicide and the other, declared as apathetic turns toward life is how Sorentino allows hope and optimism to win at the end."
"paul-allaer","8","0","1","12 January 2016"," Abstract movie about life is wistful but never sentimental
","""Youth"" (2015 release from Italy; original title ""La giovinezza""; 124 min.) brings the story of Fred Ballinger (played by Michael Caine), an 80-something retired classical musician and orchestra director. Ballinger is on extended holiday in the Swiss Alps, along with his friend of 60 years, movie director Mick Boyle (played by Harvey Keitel), and Fred's daughter Lena (played by Racheal Weisz). As the movie opens, Fred is in discussion with someone from Buckingham Palace informing him the Queen wants to honor and knight him, if only in return he'll conduct his ""Simple Songs"", which Fred resolutely refuses (we later learn why). Meanwhile, we learn that Fred's daughter Lena and Mick's son Julien are married but divorcing. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Italian director Paolo Sorrentino, who a couple of years ago won the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar for ""The Great Beauty"" (which in my book was overrated), and before that brought us that weird Sean Penn vehicle ""This Must Be the Place"", among others. Here, Sorrentino goes in a very different direction, brings us two old guys who reflect back on their lives, wondering what is left in store for them. There really is no substantive plot to speak of, just a collection of abstract, if visually gorgeous, tableaux of what is happening at the Swiss Alps spa-resort. The movie's pulse is of course Michael Caine's masterful performance as the retired orchestra conductor, whom we learn (among others from a raging monologue from his daughter Lena) has quite a troubled past as a husband and a father. There are many other noteworthy performances, including from Paul Dano, whom we saw earlier this year as Brian Wilson in ""Love and Mercy"", and here is plays the frustrated actor whom people only remember for one role (as the robot ""Mr. Q""). But wait... there is more! Deep into the second half of the film, Jane Fonda makes a memorable entrée (as the old school actress Brenda Morel), and her 10 min. role is already garnering Best Supporting Actress Oscar buzz. Any discussion of ""Youth"" would be incomplete without mentioning the fabulous soundtrack, both the classical score (courtesy of David Lang), and the songs, the best ones being courtesy of Sun Kil Moon's Mark Kozelek. His track ""Ceiling Gazing"" (which also played prominently in the movie's trailer) is the emotional lynchpin of the movie: wistful, but not sentimental. (The soundtrack is available here on Amazon.) I recently caught ""Youth"" over the year-end holidays in Ft. Myers at what turned out to be its very last screening as the next day the movie was gone. The screening I saw this at was attended okay (mostly by seniors, I might add). This movie is slow-moving (in the best possible way), and as a result I can't see this reaching a large audience in the theater. Perhaps if Caine gets an Oscar nomination (and he certainly deserves one) it is possible that this movie finds a second breath in the theater, perhaps not. Regardless, I found it to be a fantastic movie, and would encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Youth"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"marliesbajanssens","8","0","1","4 January 2016"," Clash of generations
","The clash of generations is the leading motive in the film, with several personalities from different ages coming together and seeming to intertwine. Paul Dano plays Jimmy Tree, an actor in retreat to get more in touch with his next part, the 'role of his life', of which we get a delicious taste near the end of the film. Rachel Weisz is cast as Ballinger's daughter and assistant, Lena, who has to keep her head up high after her husband leaves her for a young pop star because she is 'good in bed'.<br/><br/>Weisz fits the role, but she does not stand out next to Michael Caine, whose performance is marvelously down-to-earth and quirky at the same time. Although his character is retired, the love for music still runs through his veins, so for the little candy wrappers he constantly uses to give his relatively boring existence some meaning. Also, Roly Serrano as the overweight but world-famous Diego Maradona, and Paloma Faith as herself, are worth mentioning. It is nonetheless the appearance of Miss Universe (Madalina Ghenea) that makes the two old men's heart beat faster and makes them feel young again.<br/><br/>The amazing soundtrack serves to contrast the elder and the younger generation. Classical orchestras and bouncing beats alternate, and that is exactly what Sorrentino aims for. The film does not merely want different generations to oppose one another, but it also wants to show the possibility for past and future to intertwine and how easily the divide between young and old is crossed.<br/><br/>The Swiss Alps and their sunny natural feel form the perfect setting for Ballinger's revivification. He brilliantly composes the cows and their bells during his solitary walks. Scenes like this turn Youth into a feel-good feature film and makes one aware to enjoy every single banality in life.<br/><br/>youth1Youth is a well-directed and technically flawless film. One should definitely pay attention to the marvelous mise-en-scène. Nonetheless, when it comes to the narrative plot, Sorrentino pushes it too far and makes the end rather conform to Hollywood formula. The final part of the film has too many twists, causing it to miss its shot when it comes to conveying a proper lesson in life. Cut those last 20 minutes and the contrast between fortune and misfortune, or past and future would have been in perfect balance."

","Director/Writer Paolo Sorrentino (""The Great Beauty"" Academy Award Best Foreign Film Italy 2014) once again brings his rambling film style to YOUTH, a film about a retired orchestra conductor (Michael Cain), his daughter (Rachel Weisz - ""The Lovely Bones""), his director friend (Harvey Keitel) and a fellow ""retreat"" actor (Paul Dano - ""Little Miss Sunshine""). That much information you can count on. For the rest of the film, one can only guess what Sorrentino was trying to say and why. Cinematography (Luca Bigazzi) is stunning, the various retreat performances are intriguing (if not bazaar), Jane Fonda gives and interesting cameo performance (not necessarily worth Award consideration), while Dano, who has little to do here, transforms into his movie character (no spoiler here) which is worthy of Award consideration. Music by David Lang holds this film together, as does the terrific casting which brings many a compelling character. You'll walk out wondering why, and maybe that's a good thing?"
"luke-a-mcgowan","6","0","3","22 November 2015"," Well acted and beautiful in places but overstays its welcome by about half an hour of padding
","Youth could not be more European if the Eiffel Tower itself was in the background of every shot. It has much the same vibe of Michel Haneke's Amour, in that it contains many moments of beauty and passion in an excessively long and glacially paced film.<br/><br/>I give Michael Caine a lot of flack for cashing pay cheques and playing himself in everything, but there was something nice about his performance in Youth that made his Oscar buzz warranted. He plays Ballinger as cold, distant and guarded but when the chinks in his armour are exposed with a rare smile or an involuntary laugh, its beautifully genuine. He brings out the best of Paolo Sorrentino's writing in a beautifully heartbreaking (and Oscar-worthy) scene where he tells the Queen's envoy the reason he will not perform his songs for her. Rachel Weisz as Ballinger's recently dumped daughter, and Weisz delivers the film's finest monologue about what a distant man Ballinger was growing up. Its a worthy Oscar-scene of her own, and it sets up the aforementioned Caine scene beautifully. Alex Macqueen pops in and out as the Queen's emissary and does a wonderful job, almost comedically frustrated by the old, guarded Ballinger. <br/><br/>Youth's other plot involves Harvey Keitel's Mick Boyle, an American writer/director who is writing his testament. It takes a while for Keitel to get anything to do, but when Jane Fonda's Brenda (his long time corroborating actress) turns up to talk about his upcoming film, both of them shine. Jane Fonda clocks in at no more than seven minutes of screen time, but she owns every single second. I'm firmly against Oscars for such tiny parts, but I'm glad everyone is raving about her. <br/><br/>Paul Dano rounds out the cast as Jimmy Tree, a ""Birdman"" style actor who is only recognised for one robot part he did early in his career. I love Dano and the film could've used more of him, but at the same time I would have been happier if the story they actually gave him cut off at the conversation he had with Miss Universe. Its a thoughtful piece of writing that shows us not to underestimate people we only know for one flashy performance. Then we get the cliché fan who does actually recognise him from something else, then a bizarre crises and then the film ends for him.<br/><br/>Sorrentino's direction is beautiful, and there's more than a few well written moments especially towards the end. Where Youth goes off the rails is the fact that it takes two hours to tell a story that could've been told in one and a half. I could've done without Weisz's entire subplot (make her visiting for the week, instead of divorced, so we don't have to deal with her love story), the bizarre turn Dano takes, and minutes upon minutes of filler long shots, especially one jarring scene in which Weisz retells Keitel the best scene in the film. We all saw it, just because in real life people would tell each other doesn't mean we need to watch them telling! The whole second hour of Youth felt overstayed and honestly, there are only three scenes in Youth I'd be recommending or watching again."

","« Youth » is a complex drama by Paolo Sorrentino about Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine), a retired orchestra conductor, who is on holiday with his friend Mick Boyle(Harvey Keitel), a film director, in a luxury hotel in Switzerland for stars and famous people in the show business. We watch them as Fred, who is asked by one of the Queen of England's emissary to perform again despite refusing to do so ever again, is trying to deal with his daughter and wife's issues and as Mick is trying to write what will be his last important film. <br/><br/>I don't really know if I have enjoyed it or not, as it was sometimes quite hard to understand as well as hard to keep up with what was going on as there was also a sub-plot developing. However, I liked that the film included many incidents relating to the pair, including Fred's daughter (who is married to Mick's son) splitting from her husband, as it allowed us to get a well-rounded view of the characters' personalities as they responded to each incident. I also liked the fact that it was giving us a glimpse on how you feel when you get old and you feel like you've done everything you could have possibly done in your life. As the main they do in the film is talk, it gives us a better understanding of how they are working through their situations and it allows more characters to wander in and out of the story. Although there were some moments of complicity between the women portrayed in this film and the main characters, I didn't enjoy how they were pictured as either needing men in their life to be successful and as being incapable of being independent or just being beautiful but therefore being stupid.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the film to perhaps an older generation who can more closely relate with such a story. As a teenager, I was sometimes confused with the different directions the film was taking and the different stories the characters were introducing, perhaps as I haven't had the opportunity to live some of the experiences that the characters discuss. Overall however, the film was compelling and nicely integrated the plots well, creating an emotional, 'overwhelming' film."
