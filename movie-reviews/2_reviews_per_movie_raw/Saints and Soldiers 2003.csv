"remay1","10","101","137","21 January 2005"," Powerful war movie gem.
","Every once in a while a little movie will come along totally unheralded, unexpected, under budget, under promoted, but which really shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>Saints and Soldiers is such a movie. If you like lots of big budget special effect -loud explosions, -crashing airplanes, -panoramic scenes with thousands of extras slogging through the mud, -if that's what you want in a war movie, skip this one. It doesn't have any of those things.<br/><br/>What it does have, however, is a very effective ensemble cast telling a very compelling story, -a true story, of the Battle of the Bulge. From the utter confusion and tragic consequences of the ""Malmedy Masacre"", depicted in this movie as more an accident of the fog of war rather than a cold calculated act, to the final climactic battle scenes, this movie shows world war II as it most likely really was. A very personal war for each soldier involved.<br/><br/>My uncle was a soldier who lost a leg in Europe during that time and as he related experiences of battle, he always made it perfectly clear that war was always a very personal thing. You were doing everything to survive. Your enemy was doing the same thing, and somehow battles were eventually won or lost. The average G.I. didn't know, or much care what was going on over the hill, or on a grand scale. He only knew he and a few of his buddies were being shot at by a few of the enemy and they had to shoot back or perish. It's all about living another day.<br/><br/>This movie conveys those sentiments very clearly. It is about daily survival without the grandiose trappings. You really wind up caring about each of these characters. It is well worth seeing. Especially if you were a soldier -or know a soldier, -or just want to know more about being a soldier. In my opinion it will go down in history as one of the more realistic war movies ever made."
"smithfam548","Null","90","125","11 October 2004"," Worthy of all the ""Best Picture"" awards
","This movie is worthy of the 14 ""Best Picture"" awards it has already won...I hope that it gets a bigger national release.<br/><br/>I live in the San Diego area and I just took my family to see this film tonight, and I have to say that this is one of the most moving films I have seen. <br/><br/>I felt like this was an appropriate movie for my 13 yr old daughter to view (I would not recommend for any younger). The story was told so well that I felt she understood the underlying messages. We were able to have a very long discussion afterward about war and accountability of those who unjustly cause wars. We talked about recognizing the humanity behind the ""enemy"" soldiers who are, for the most part, just doing their duty to country. These men have wives, children, fathers and mothers who love them just as much as the families of the soldiers on ""our"" side.<br/><br/>I literally was speechless at the end of the film. The ""surprise"" ending caught me a little off-guard with its VERY poignant and thought provoking message.<br/><br/>The characters were well developed and I really felt that i could empathize with each man's approach to the situation they were in.<br/><br/>The impact of the movie far exceeded its budget. I was very impressed with the actors (for example, the beautiful French woman...who WAS that?). <br/><br/>I think I was most impressed with the acting of the Medic (The exchange of looks between him and the German prisoner at the end of the movie was classic!).<br/><br/>I read a lot of the reviews prior to watching this film, so I had somewhat of a biased opinion about what I might see. I have to admit, I found myself feeling like the movie exceeded my expectations and was VERY much worth it. I don't buy many movies...this is one I definitely will buy for my private library."
"Jacko44","Null","62","84","27 September 2004"," A simple story told with great skill. Very satisfying
","This is a very simple story, told in a very simple way.A group of soldiers escape capture and fight their way to rejoin friendly forces. Nothing new or unusual there. However Ryan Little has managed to tell this simple story with a great sense of compassion and feeling. So much so that at times I had to remind myself that this was a story of war. Little manages to do what many others have failed in the modern war movie, let the story take preference over special effects and shock tactics.<br/><br/>The largely unheralded cast turn in steady, rather than spectacular, performances. Yet they work well within the over all feel of the movie, showing that war is fought by, in the most part, ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances. At times the pace was a little labored, particularly at the farmhouse. The relationship with the mother and child seemed to develop too quickly, somehow become pivotal almost instantly. This aside, character development occurs at a natural and easy pace. All these men are people we will meet in our own lives, bringing the story even closer to the audience.<br/><br/>This is one of the most satisfying war movies that I have seen for a long while. Without the big budgets and extreme violence, this little gem delivers a fantastic reward for those who take the time to watch.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"123ray","10","118","169","17 February 2005"," Outstanding in every sense
","My wife and I go out to see a movie every Friday night. Some nights, I'll tell you, the Picken's Is Slim, as they were when we saw this film about six months ago (if memory serves). I'd never heard of it. She didn't want to see any more war films since that miserable, over-hyped ""Pearl Harbor"" with the lame love story thrown into the mix. (Cuba Gooding was the only good part in the movie, and, shock! His character's part really happened, too! Hollywood take note!) To tell you the truth, we nearly went to rent something to watch at home, but as we left, we heard a guy in line talking excitedly about how he'd seen it three times, and loved it. What the heck. We got back in line. Their popcorn is better than ours. We went in, not expecting much of anything.<br/><br/>I'll tell you, we were blown away. I came on this site tonight because I've been meaning to write and tell everybody to go see this little film that only ran a week in our local theater. (Buy the DVD!) I have read every comment on this site, and have to LOL at the comments about Mormons. What Mormons? I never even knew it was Mormons until I read it tonight on this site! And so what? It happened to a Mormon guy. It was his story. You expect Catholics to tell it? The other complaints about the story being predictable...what? It sure got us! It was a true story. Don't you get it? If it's true, you can't change what really happened--and what happened was humanity showing it's face. It was right winning out over allegiance.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the DVD coming out. I'm getting it and showing it to all my friends. This is film-making the way it should be done. We want to see it more of it."
"slinkydog","10","79","118","30 August 2004"," A triumph in war movies
","In my own opinion, this is a triumph for war movies. It's just as intense as any war movie, but doesn't contain all the blood and guts our society today gives us. It has enough to convince the audience that it's all real and then brings you into the atmosphere by the fantastic acting. (Kudos to all actors involved) This is also a low-budget film, which helps you appreciate it even more because there are no signs of that small budget. This is just as intense as pretty much any war movie you will ever see, but you don't have to worry about it being too violent or bloody. It's just as compelling because it puts you inside the eyes of the soldiers themselves. I hope that all who have access to see this movie take advantage of it because this is a side of cinema that isn't seen often."
"droopfozz","10","59","87","6 August 2004"," Probably the best made film under $1 Million
","The comment posted on the main page link certainly had an axe to grind against mormons. In fact the film itself never at all mentions the LDS church and for all we know Deacon could have been a baptist.  That is all besides the point. The film takes us where a war film has never been before, the religious implications. And it is not overtly preachy. Somehow with under $1 million dollars the director has made a film that looks like an epic hollywood war film, complete with handheld cameras and a few war buddy cliche's. But what seperates this film from the pack is its main character, a devout religious sharpshooter, shellshocked from a raid gone bad, trying to make moral sense of what is going on. The film is also a great war film, and impecably accurate historically. The only sign that the film is low budget is its musical score, which at some times is a bit obtruse, but the acting is superb, and the directions is excellent. 9/10"
"weedie","7","54","83","5 October 2004"," interesting, human, powerful.
","Saints and Soldiers is a quite powerful movie. It has a very human side, although the idea is not very unique. <br/><br/>A movie about 5 brave allied soldiers fighting their way back to base from behind enemy lines, during WW II. <br/><br/>Each of the characters embodies a different human typology. There is a subtle religious side, also. <br/><br/>The movie has a good visual narrative construction. It is worth being seen.<br/><br/>The main idea is that, behind the soldier uniform there is a human being."
"blue-7","10","45","70","6 August 2004"," Festival Winner Is Exceptional!
","FOR more then a year I have waited to see Ryan Little's SAINTS & SOLDIERS. Back in the fall of 2002, KSL-TV did a featurette on Mormon filmmakers and showed location scenes being shot in Alpine, Utah of a film with a World War II setting. It seemed like an ambitious undertaking for a low budget filmmaker. As time went on and the film was completed, word came out that the film was very good. Instead of bring it immediately to local theatres, Excel (the distributor for the film), began showing it at film festivals all over the place -- and it hit home with film fans, winning numerous awards.<br/><br/>When the film opened its theatrical run here in Utah. I have had the opportunity to see the film for myself and can say that it is EXCEPTIONAL!<br/><br/>Uncle Sam invited me to join them for 2 years back in the early 1960's. I was glad to serve my country and was even more grateful that I did not have to actually fight in a shooting war. Going through basic training and later, holding my breath as the Cuban missile crises came and went, I wonder what I would do if called upon to fire with intent to kill. I'm glad that I was not put to that kind of test.<br/><br/>As I experienced SAINTS & SOLDIERS, watching a young soldier of faith, who had previously served his church as a missionary in Berlin, face the reality of killing those whom he had come to love and respect, it touched my heart in a way no other war film has ever done. The film is very well acted, tense, moving and thought provoking. In short, this is a film that I will strongly recommend, will return again to see in the theatre, and will certainly purchase when released on DVD.<br/><br/>Congratulations to all involved!"
"count_me_out1983","1","26","39","23 November 2005"," Quite possibly the cheesiest war movie ever made.
","About a week ago i watched a trailer for the war movie, Brotherhood and i liked what i saw.After renting the title, and thoroughly enjoying it i returned it to the store and whilst there saw an equally promising trailer running for Saints and Soldiers. Me and a friend of mine instantly rented the title and afterwards we felt our money was wasted. Firstly, as far as authenticity is concerned, it is flawed and these flaws are listed on the IMDb page. Secondly, in the first 10 minutes of the film i had nailed every character in the movie. The over questioning medic, the gung ho yokel(I just wanna shoot me some krauts), the honourable sergeant, the crazy religious marksman with a mental condition and last but not least, the stiff upper lipped British pilot which as a Brit extremely offends me. Most RAF pilots were local boys ranking as low as flight sergeant, not the pompous mustachioed lord types. The tongue in cheek conversational exchanges between the pilot and the yokel almost made me switch the film off, 'dammit i just need a cigarette'.Awful. The accompanying banjo music whenever he was on screen made me want to tear out my hair. The lack of combat in the film is a major weak point and in the few instances in which there is a war on, the scenes are literally unbelievable, for example the American infantryman firing a bazooka at German soldiers (video game style) when there is a perfectly good perimeter set up with machine guns overlooking the field. Grenades seem so over used, is this a James Bond movie? It was obvious that Sarge was going to die, maybe he would be more fitting in Starship Troopers, i dunno. A film of this calibre would have been accepted as 'good' back in the 1950s but come on, this is 2005! The film obviously had a decent budget, it could have done a lot better with the resources it had, people want to see realism. You can badmouth special effects all you like but that is what the people want.The whole story was fit for post midnight television. Seriously, if you want a good laugh, rent this movie, its funnier that Sergeant Bilko, but if you want a seriously good example of winter conflict just watch Band of Brothers, or to give you a low budget example, When Trumpets Fade."
"sektor-1","8","39","64","8 August 2004"," A gem of a film.
","Many films succeed outside the context of Hollywood hype. This one provides several messages competently executed by new talent, and without the special effects so commonly packaged by Tinseltown. Dialog and talent hold one's attention in a real-world interpretation of the Malmedy massacre and it's aftermath in WW2 Belgium. The tagline, 'A Time For Heroes' says much and it's more than appropriate for our time since the definition of 'hero' has been broadened by current events and uncommon courage. Lighting, sound, location, editing, and inventive writing make this a weekend wonder if you're seeking a story of principled men in desperate circumstances. Not unlike John Sturges' films."
"hhfarm-1","2","35","60","14 January 2007"," Boring, clichéd, dull, one-dimensional, tedious, stilted, contrived
","Nothing but clichés really. DD (French for Deadly Dull).<br/><br/>There's a cynical New Yorker who learns near the end that not all Germans are bad. He has a secret.<br/><br/>There's a young ex-missionary religious type who hates to kill but is a great shot with a rifle. He has a secret.<br/><br/>There's a tough but kind-hearted sergeant.<br/><br/>There's a French woman with a young daughter. They live in a stone cottage in the woods. Afraid at first, she comes to love the Americans and gives them some bread.<br/><br/>There's a polite but unctuous Brit.<br/><br/>There's a gent from Louisiana who likes to say ""whatever"" some 50 years before it came into common usage. He spends part of his time asking the Brit for a cigarette and being turned down. He then saves the Brit but is wounded. The Brit puts a cigarette in his mouth and, yup, he dies. The Brit cries. He's learned to be more human.<br/><br/>There are some sadistic Germans. But there's one good one. Just one.<br/><br/>There's no drama, no tension, no interesting action. The Americans are hidden in an old building. Germans come and camp out above them for a while. It should have been nerve-wracking. Instead, you feel nothing. It isn't even interesting.<br/><br/>When there's a revelation, music comes up and the character stares at the camera for a bit. So that you won't miss it.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't the worst. The story and direction are a joke. The worst episode of ""Combat"" beats this hands-down."
"ingvar-10","3","25","41","6 January 2006"," Bad acting, predictable story.
","I'll keep this ""rewiev"" simple. <br/><br/>The plot about different people finding and helping each other is good enough, but it fails to deliver.<br/><br/>I liked the beginning of the movie. It gave me hopes for a good story. But after the initial slaughter and the escape of a few gi's it declined. You feel that u have seen this a thousand times before, you always knew what would happened next. At least a surprise or 2 would be nice. (The part where the ""missonary"" capture a German soldier that shows out to be an old pupil from Berlin was just plain silly).<br/><br/>Every time the soldiers where ""bonding"" it felt like a cliché, done a million times before. The actors are non-convincing. When the soldiers where talking it seldom felt natural, especially the British pilot was awful. It feels like they just want to get the scene done and go home. <br/><br/>The scenes portraying bad weather where laughable. It sounded stormy, but the trees around never moved. And the snow was falling straight to ground, not being forced by the wind that was supposed to be there.<br/><br/>This is one of the worst war-movies I have ever seen."
"kawrider1100","2","53","98","2 January 2007"," Proselytizing with WWII
","It's a Mormon production that avoids explicitly labeling the hero as a Mormon in order to draw in a wider Christian audience. The movie has many problems that were not related to the limited budget. To begin with, the characters who escape the Malmedy Massacre are wearing 101st Airborne Div. shoulder patches. This unit was not in the area of attack at the beginning of the German's Ardennes offensive. In fact, it was members of a field artillery observation battalion who were captured at Malmedy. The portrayal of the medic is is unbelievable and designed to make the Mormon hero appear even more saintly. It was a rare occurrence that a combat medic in the European Theater would carry a sidearm, let alone a rifle while wearing red cross identification patches as this was a violation of the Geneva Conventions. The medic in this movie carries a rifle without hesitation and acts more like an infantryman. The movie claims to be based on actual events, but the only actual event it seems to use is the massacre. The plot line for the RAF pilot seems pretty bogus. He says he was flying photo reconnaissance, but that early in the battle Allied aircraft were grounded by the weather. Even if conditions were clear in England, ground fog and a low cloud cover would have prevented the taking of intelligence photos from the air.<br/><br/>The film looks nice, but that is about it. The production needed a fact checker."
"kpn-3","1","18","30","14 August 2006"," Boring film!
","First of all: Kudos for making a big movie on a small budget. That's something to admire. But, - I found the film very, very boring. None of the characters managed to become more than cardboard figures representing some cliché archetypal movie character, if that. Two of the main characters were just about invisible, as badly drawn as they were. No doubt the true stories that the film is based on are extremely interesting and impressive on their own, but that never makes it into this movie. It all falls apart because of one-dimensional acting, shoddy directing and, well, bloodless plot. There are no hooks.<br/><br/>I watched the whole thing with director/producer's commentary afterwards, and the banality of their thinking shocked me. More than once my girlfriend and I burst out laughing from the Hallmark card philosophy and the team's blindness to the film's obvious faults.<br/><br/>Sorry - good try, but doesn't really cut it."
"techboardhr","3","20","34","19 November 2006"," Low budget, weak acting, boring, need I go on?
","It seemed the majority of the apparently small budget was spent in the first five minutes and that was nothing special. From there prepare for a slow meaningless meander in the hills or what we see of them anyway. The writing is really bad and the acting is not much better. I am shocked that this is rated a 7, that is laughable. It is shot in the style that reminds one of a cheaply made soap opera and that gives the film an unreal cloying tone throughout. I had watched ""El Alamein"" right before this POS and found it much better. In fact I can't remember seeing much of a worse war movie than ""Saints and Soldiers"" I doubt most people would sit through this rubbish even as made for TV movie."
"short_lil_chick","1","22","39","4 September 2005"," Did anyone else NOT like this movie?!
","I really really really did not like this movie. I mean I love WWII movies and shows (Band of Brothers was excellent) but I had a hard time getting in to this one, and then it just seemed like it ended. The movie went along just fine I think until the end. It's seemed the main character got shot, and his God hating comrade takes his scriptures. I'm assuming he reads them, but he could have taken them to give them back to his folks. <br/><br/>Another thing is our guilt ridden Mo character (I say Mo for Mormon and am Mo and do not mean any offense by it). He never seems to really reconcile with himself, which if this were the only loose end might be OK, but they dumped all this stuff out in the movie, and it seemed almost like they didn't have the money to wrap it up so they just stopped."
"jeffonsax","5","13","21","4 September 2009"," As a British viewer this was poor
","As a British viewer I would categorise this film as OK but not great. My main problem with it the way that the British airman was portrayed. The character is portrayed as a selfish, rude and not very nice person.<br/><br/>Sure there are some Brits like this but in this film we are not told why. It would have been good to have had some background and character development on why this RAF plot behaved like this.<br/><br/>Other problems with this film is the plot. I was disappointed it did not tell the story of the massacre of the unarmed US troops at Malmedy. Instead it concentrated on a behind enemy lines escape.<br/><br/>The cinema-photography is good which is shot mainly in a snow covered forest. Acting is OK but again I found the medics character confusing. Why was he so nasty to the guy suffering from shell shock? If you are addicted to war films then see this, but it is not as good a Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>If you are British this is in the mould of a Mel Gibson 'make the Britis look bad' type movie."
"rvcarr","3","20","35","12 September 2005"," Saving Private Brigham
","Not an awful movie, but this one is somewhat dull and predictable. The characters are straight out of central casting - the farm boy, the guy from Brooklyn, etc. A great deal of the picture involves trekking through the forest while loudly chatting - probably not the best of survival skills during wartime. There are no surprises in this movie- when the sarge gets wistful and talks of the beauty of the French countryside, you know that he will be shot ASAP; and of course Deacon upon his death will see the civilians he accidentally killed (The six people you don't WANT to meet in Heaven.)<br/><br/>A bigger problem with this movie is that it is over-rated because it seems to be very popular with the LDS community who have skewed both the ratings here and at NetFlix. I'm sure that the Scientologists all thought that ""Battlefield Earth"" was greatest picture ever made also. Those of us who can separate our religion from our entertainment may find this film a disappointment."

","I watched 10 minutes into this movie, and then I fast forwarded the rest.<br/><br/>Long, boring, clunky, episodic and badly acted. It even has a Brit soldier with a moustache and a silly stiff-upper lip worthy of Monty Python. The long 'men on the march' sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, just in winter time and with a worse musical score.<br/><br/>In the rest of the world we don't really need more movies about American soldiers in WW2. I could not or did not connect with any of these country lads or their journey.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this movie even if you liked Saving Private Ryan, it also lacks any kind of exciting action or battle scenes that distinguished the latter."

","I have seen that this movie did not cost much to make, and it is startlingly obvious from the get- go. I'm not saying that films have to cost £100 million to be good, of course not, but to say this film is good, just because it was cheap, is very misleading. <br/><br/>There is no conviction in any part. The acting is amateurish at best. The English ""accent"" is terrible and it feels like the actors hadn't met before the scenes were shot. The script is tired and unoriginal. You don't get a sense of togetherness or camaraderie and I have seen better acting in Home and Away. There is cliché after cliché, I was so disappointed. When the American says he can speak German, it is so funny. Bitte and danke with the biggest American accent you have ever heard. Then the ""British"" guy enters the fray. Wow. If this wasn't written by Americans who have never been to England, or met a British person, then I would be entirely surprised.<br/><br/>I like war movies, I really do, but this was tedious, contrived, clichéd and boring.

","I really enjoyed the film and it gave a different slant to the Malmedy massacre which took place in 1944. The snow scenes gave the film a great atmosphere. Most of the actors played excellent parts, the plot involving a group of American GIs coming across an English (RAF) pilot. One problem was Kirby Heyborne. If I came across Kirby Heyborne's as ""Englishman"" during World War II I would be tempted to shoot him as a German spy. His accent is dreadful and certainly not English. At times he was a comic opera Englishman and next an American. Was an English actor, living in the United States, not available to play this important part? It would have made a big difference to the film."

I had my doubts, but it's rare that a highly rated film gets placed on the schedule for midday from this station. So, I sat for a while to check it out. By the time I knew what was happening, the film was over. Wow. That doesn't happen very often.<br/><br/>For such a low budget film, this is one of the best human interest stories I've ever seen from the World War II perspective. It gets down and dirty in the trenches and explores the inner doubts, fears and certainties of the soldier's reality. It even, God forbid, shows us that even the enemy can have members that are both compassionate and understanding in the face of mindless human tragedy and death.<br/><br/>My compliments to the extraordinary effort the technicians and extras put into placing these actors into real human situations and into a scenario that is hard to detect as a forest in Utah. We had a hard time figuring the location, even though we had been there in person. If high budget motion pictures had just a fraction of the attention to detail and freedom to express real stories that this one has, what an amazing set of movies we'd see on the big screen.<br/><br/>I can do nothing other than highly recommend this film.

Religion really wasn't too intertwined with the movie, but it was Deacon's values that helps them survive, not a movie where religion is preached. I believe that ""Signs"" was more of a religious story than this was, as well as ""The Count of Monty Cristo"" It is probably just because of how people are prejudice against Mormons. I had a great time and anyone who looks past the fact that it was made by Mormons (which is sad that it must be overlooked by some people) and enjoys the movie, will discover it is awesome and worth seeing again and again."

A pity because so much of it seemed to be well done - kit, costumes, weapons, scenery (with real snow) were fine and I suspect the vehicles would have been good if I had seen more of it, but the wooden acting (with the possible exception of the Sergeant, played by Peter Holden) and shambling action made it hard to watch. When the character with the ludicrous 'posh RAF English' accent (and I *do* mean ludicrous) arrived, I started to lose it - fast!<br/><br/>The last straw for me was the (almost ubiquitous, nowadays) Sixth Sense rip-off when a ghostly figure flitted across the screen accompanied by the obligatory, scary **chong** sound. After that I really started to look for the flaws and lasted only another 5 minutes or so before I crapped out.<br/><br/>Three out of ten for making an effort with the hardware and scenery and because I have never given a movie with so low a score before - I couldn't go lower without feeling bad towards the people who made it and, no doubt, mostly meant well!!"
"imxo","4","13","25","7 May 2005"," Mormom Proselytizing Disguised As A War Movie
","OK, let me begin by saying that ""Saints and Soldiers"" isn't really a bad film. It's merely deceptive and - because of that - dishonest.<br/><br/>I got suckered into seeing this film by my careless reading of a movie review by well-know columnist Roger Ebert. If he had been open enough - or aware enough - to disclose the movie's obvious Mormon content I would not have spent my money to take the family to see it. When I think about it, of course, I should have understood the tip-off given by the use of the word ""saints"" in the title. Not only that, but I was once before taken in by one of these Mormon-message films at this same theater. Either the theater management is Mormon, or they are trying to attract Mormon patron dollars. I think it's the former.<br/><br/>In any event, once in the theater it soon became apparent that something was amiss with the film. The American soldiers in the film were in a platoon that could not exist outside the state of Utah.<br/><br/>Look at the star ratings given to this film by the reviewers on this site and you'd think this movie ranked up there with Ben-Hur or Gone With The Wind. What's happened, of course, is that the home-town Provo crowd and their Utah co-religionists have packed the site with positive reviews. Page after page of raves for what is, in essence, a film with all the production values - as good as they are - of a made-for-TV movie. Especially egregious in the film was the absurd English accent attempted by actor Kirby Heybone - absolutely the worst foreign accent on film since that Scottish actor tried to pass as a Russian in ""Hunt for the Red October."" <br/><br/>So, despite the seemingly objective, patriotic, mainstream message of this war movie, in reality director Ryan Little's film is more an unconscious homage to the work of Leni Riefenstahl than anything else. Dr. Goebbel's would not have approved of the message of this film, of course, but he would certainly have admired the technique."

Sorry. It's true. ***SPOILER ALERT*** The film is ""based on true events"" and the online material is farely explicit about the fact that the Deacon character who encounters a German soldier that he knew prior to the war is based on real people who had just such an experience.

","A very rewarding payoff comes to those willing to slog through the cold winter of 1944 with these soldiers. Like any march in the military, there's some ""hurry up and wait"" moments that tend to slow the plot down a little bit. And the ""character"" scenes aren't as professionally rendered as perhaps they could have been. Quibbles, though, because the story reaches a generally unexpected and very emotional payoff, and the trek is more than worthwhile. Film should play well on DVD, given decent but not spectacular use of big screen. Utah stands in pretty well for the Ardennes, but that winter was Europe's worst in 50 years and the dry cold of the US West doesn't really seem to convey the real misery the climate brought to the GIs. Acting generally strong all around with the squad leader, a kind of heavier Jeff Daniels type, particularly good and really evocative of a GI sixty years ago. Fine, moving film."

If you're looking for huge battles and lots of guts and blood, this ain't the movie for you. The firefights in this movie is pretty intense and exiting, the director (Ryan Little) really nailed it. This movie is about survival, friendship, courage and sacrifice. We get to see the real side of the war between the allies and the Nazis, is there really any good/evil here? That question popped up a few times during the movie, and I think that is really special for this kind of movie..<br/><br/>I simply can't write a review about this movie without mentioning the quality of the picture here. It is so good, film makers today would be proud to accomplish this, it looks amazing! The landscape is really beautiful and sets a special tone for the film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to people who likes a good war movie, but this is also a drama, a really good drama.

","After surviving a massacre in Malmedy, a location behind the German army in Europe, four American soldiers with only one weapon rescue the British pilot Oberon Winley (Kirby Heyborn) in a tree and they move together, trying to reach the allied forces and save a great number of allied soldiers from a German attack with the information got by Winley in his flight. While marching, each soldier discloses inner secrets to the rest of the group.<br/><br/>What a great movie this ""Saints and Soldiers"" is! Awarded with many prizes in minor festivals, and recommended by some friends of mine, I saw it yesterday and I was really surprised with a powerful humanistic war story. I do not know how precise it is, but the screenplay was based on true events as per the information in the beginning of the film.

Most of the time they rest, and fill the 87 minutes with card tricks and endless, hollow chatting about life back home etc. The characters seem to be outlined with just a couple of personal traits each: this guy wants smokes and performs card tricks. This guy is religious and has scruples. At times the narrative gets stuck so badly, it is actually quite comical.<br/><br/>Sure, technically all the gear is OK, the explosions and bullet hits look real. Modern war films are like that.

","Saints and Soldiers is a movie that actually reaffirmed Christian values, the belief in God, and the universality of God's presence. What is the movie industry coming to? How could Christianity be portrayed in a positive light? And then this piece of ""propaganda"" won some film festival awards! Horrible. Christians are all hypocritical, brainwashed zombies, who follow money grubbing preachers and are worse sinners than any humanist. I have always counted on the movie industry, especially ""art"" films, to expose the underbelly of Christianity, and to expose their audience to only alternative and life--affirming living styles.<br/><br/>What happen with Saints and Soldiers? The Christian characters were not stereotypic religious fanatics, crazy and repressive, insane in their beliefs, but thoughtful and complex individuals trying to deal with the realities of the horror of war while maintaining their core values. The arguments between believers and non-believers are passionate but reasoned with each side giving a perspective based on their personal backgrounds and experiences and giving equal validity. Those wimpy Mormon movie makers--even the agnostics are treated fairly and seem to be decent people (ie the medic, Gould), but of course the hero, Deacon, is a Christian, formerly a missionary. But wait, in the beginning of the movie Deacon seems crazed and demented, not sympathetic in many respects. The Germans are both good and bad. One attempts a rape, while another is a friend of Deacon and actually seems to be a good guy. There is not a lot of black and white characters, but in the end the biblical message of brotherhood and love prevails even in the ugly face of the brutality of war.<br/><br/>This was an excellent movie. It was so refreshing to watch a movie where Christianity was giving a fair shake."

","This movie is a transparent compilation of WW2 movie clichés and a Mormon propaganda vehicle. The corny religious overtones are amateurish at best and insulting at worst. I tried to like this movie and I am puzzled by the awards it received. The characters are one dimensional and I had no empathy for their plight. The ridiculousness of the main character encountering the 1 in 17 million Germans he had known on his ""mission"" is laughable. The religious mystical bullshit is an insult to all the real combatants and victims of a necessary war.

","They say after every massacre, there are always survivors. That is certainly true for this film which relates the story of four American soldiers who escaped the unwarranted and despicable atrocity, later called 'The Malmedy Massacre'. The movie is entitled "" Saints and Soldiers "" and is the saga of the men who, having survived the massacre, must now journey back to their own lines. In the middle of a winter storm, the tiny group must do so without food or supplies through enemy infested woods, all the while trying to stay alive. Though they escape, their ordeal is further hampered by suspicion, fear, freezing conditions and the discovery of a downed British airman. The officer has vital information which must reach communication lines to safeguard the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers. Amid the ivory snow-laden landscape, two soldiers, Cpl. Nathan 'Deacon' Greer (Corbin Allred) and Medic Steven Gould ((Alexander Niver) clash over personal ideologies, trying hard to fathom each others steadfast beliefs. Military situations change on both sides allowing the men to exchange trusts, doubts and suspicions. The result? A quite and sobering conclusion creating troubling emotions for both men and an equally poignant ending to the story. A good film and one which allows the audience to acquire ample food for thought. ****"
"Sillen","5","4","8","3 April 2006"," Standard war movie lacking a big budget
","I would like to love this movie. I like war movies, especially World War II movies. And it would be really sweet to kick Hollywood blockbusters in the nuts, and prove that you don't need a large budget to make a good movie. It turns out this is just a standard, clichéd war movie. With a low budget. Don't get me wrong, low budget movies can be really good if they're paired with new ideas and different angles on the subject they're dealing with. And the first 15 minutes really aren't that bad, it's a dramatic and promising beginning. But that's about it. From then on you can start counting the war movie clichés at the same rate you're eating your popcorn. The humanized Germans, the arrogant British officer, why they fight, why God should care about their sorry butts and... Yawn. I think we've got a case of the emperor's new clothes here. I mean seriously, this movie hasn't got a string on its body."
"bbagnall","Null","6","14","26 July 2004"," Good beginning, average middle, powerful ending
","This movie starts with the Malmedy massacre, which has always been controversial because researchers have had a difficult time trying to produce an accurate picture of what really occurred. The film manages to stage it fairly accurately, given the testimony from the soldiers at the time. It's worth noting under the Geneva convention, captors are allowed to shoot fleeing POW's, so technically the German's did nothing wrong and hence all who were brought to trial were eventually released.<br/><br/>There are times when the movie seems to create damning scenarios for the Germans that are not backed up by the historical record, such as the escapees finding a destroyed ambulance with the occupants dead. In reality, Germans did not destroy ambulances in WWII unless they were part of a larger convoy and accidentally taken out. Furthermore, some Germans in uniform behave barbarous, like when a  peasant woman offers one bread and he throws it down. In reality, a German soldier would have been quite welcoming of non-ration food. So in may ways, the human motivations just seem skewed in order establish ""evil"".<br/><br/>Later in the film, four allied soldiers manage to take on ten to twenty heavily equipped German soldiers. German soldiers do things like walk into bullets, catch bullets with their heads, forget how to use their guns, and blow each other up with their own grenades. It just didn't seem realistic, though it was well filmed.<br/><br/>There are some surprisingly powerful moments in the film which add up to an ending more meaningful than anything Hollywood has ever managed. One character, a British pilot who meets up with the allies, is a real prick when they first meet him. At first, this put me off and it seemed like anti-British sentiment. However, Kirby Heyborne, who plays the British Oberon Winley, develops as a character, making the ending much more powerful for him having started as a nasty guy. I was surprised and moved by this redeeming outcome.<br/><br/>I was disappointed they chose to present a German soldier who betrays his own men as a good person. Sure, he knew one of the allies before the war, but treason is not a virtue! These Germans were fighting for their country, much of which was robbed post WWI and given to Poland and Czechoslovakia. A movie should not present a traitor as a role model in my opinion, even if he is on the enemy side.<br/><br/>Overall, it is great to see a film of such quality produced outside Hollywood. Diversity of ideas is a good thing, and this is just one more take on the war from a Mormon point of view, which is welcomed. As a materialist and an atheist, any religious message in the film was pretty much meaningless to me. Through the middle of the film, much like Saving Private Ryan, the soldiers have their soliloquies which belies the truth of how real soldiers would talk to one another. This movie had a great start, subdued middle, and a powerful finish which makes it worth watching."

This movie has its moments of personal charm, emotional connection to various characters though some of them tend to fall into the superficial categories required by many military films. Yet most of the soldiers here are someone we can relate to and the message of the film has a strong resonating component that many other war films fail to capture. The bullets and the military action is excellent. The movie isn't as dirty as some movies, yet it still carries its action and pacing decently if not rivetingly well.

"nammage","5","1","1","2 October 2017"," Based on Actual Events?
","I'm not one of those who get my history from films (or think I know a book because I saw the film it's based on) but if you're going to put such a tagline at the beginning of a film make sure there's some semblance of truth to it. Fiction from the beginning: 101st Airborne were not at the Malmedy Massacre, did not take place in the massacre and pretty much, in my opinion, insults the mainly 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion who were. There are little nitpicks, of course, but that's huge. It's like the film U- 571 saying it was the American Navy who got the first Enigma machine when that was total fiction when in fact the HMS Bulldog of Britain's Royal Navy got the first one in 1941, and the US Navy only got one and that was in 1944 well after the British had already cracked the code. <br/><br/>That's the biggest problem with American films such as these: they always have to be the heroes but not just the heroes: the first heroes, the ultimate heroes etc., everyone else pales in comparison (I'm American, by the by). There's a difference between being patriotic and just claiming patriotism that was never there to begin with.<br/><br/>The only evidential events in this is the battles and places they mention; everything else is speculation and fiction for other purposes. Which is fine but be honest about it, at least. According to the commentary of the film on what actually is true are insignificant things (two guys of the same religion on different sides -- so what? It's like all Nazis were atheists, or something? -- a German POW made his food look like an angel: again: like all Nazis or Waffen-SS etc., were atheists? -- some US soldiers hid under a floor while Germans ate above them. So what? You know how many Jews during the war did that?) This film sure isn't about the Malmedy Massacre because that's that's over in the first five minutes. So, what is this film about? Four (or five) guys try to get to Allied lines without getting captured by the Germans. No. It's not about that. Oh, they got some intelligence by a British pilot they run into and must get that to the allies! No. Not about that, either. So what is it about? It's about the Mormon church (LDS) promoting Mormonism. That's what it's about. <br/><br/>Now while it's finely thinned, not directly mentioned it is there and mainly with the main character who carries around his Book of Mormon (not the OT/NT Bible) and attempts to vainly convert another of the four who keeps pushing him away until the very end when he takes it from him at last. No more being a godless heathen atheist but now sees the light and becomes a Mormon, per sé. I'm sure that's the ultimate message.<br/><br/>Eh, as an overall film: it wasn't that bad but it gets, at least from me, major points taken away by not displaying the actual battalion because, I feel, that does a disservice to those who not only died but also survived."

","I was fortunate enough to get a private screening on base. I totally recommend watching this movie when it comes out August 6 in theaters, and I'm definitely getting the DVD when it comes out. You too won't regret it. Kudos to everyone involved, with their excellent portrayals and story filled with fascinatingly human relations based on actual events from WWII. The authentic tanks and other vehicles you see were borrowed, and luckily this movie got them because Wind Talkers and even Saving Private Ryan got passed up when their producers made requests for them. That tells you something already right there about this movie's influence, draw, and sheer raw power.<br/><br/>Even without the references to faith, this film would've been great, yet it wouldn't have had the same emotional impact like it did. Trust me on this. When you saw the Passion of the Christ, you know you weeped, maybe even felt sorry for living your life the way you have. That's what made this movie so rare and touching, and it didn't resort to useless profanity and such, nor any sort of preaching to the choir. It was really patriotic in a time of anti-Americanism by a few rich, elite people like Michael Moore. The imagery and cinematography captured Nazis and Allies with realism. Although not overly bloody, you get the impression from the effects that war is real and dangerous, and therefore the sacrifices by me and my brothers-and-sisters-in-arms come to light, even for those who don't believe in what we do.<br/><br/>I got a chance to meet the producer/director Ryan Little and the primary actor of the movie, Corbin Allred, whose character you could really feel for. All supporting actors and co-stars did an excellent job showcasing a feeling of family and camaraderie, closer to the real military than even Band of Brothers tried to display. Two great men with the courage and talent to put this thing together in 30 days on a shoe-string budget, yet it looks like a multi-million dollar movie. He thanked us all for our service to our country and we thanked him for the support. Believe me, I know good acting when I see it -- I used to act and model myself! Go see it, it'll make my day! :) God bless the USA is all I have to say."
"secondtake","7","3","6","4 June 2010"," Great intentions, some harsh realism, but uneven writing and a few avoidable clichés
","Saints and Soldiers (2003)<br/><br/>A World War II movie made in the 21st Century has to have something new to say, and this one attempts to do that with gritty, intimate realism. It succeeds in that, to some extent, but it also has some familiar clichés in the dialog and the general plot details which cover familiar ground.<br/><br/>The scenario starts with some fast cutting that creates a sense of danger and drama with some sacrifice of logic. We just know things go badly for the Americans. Then it follows some stragglers who have survived, and things grow gradually more coherent. As the men come to know, and not completely like, each other, they form bonds that get tested, and there is heartbreak and hardship enough for anyone.<br/><br/>What holds all of this up is a modern sense of full color, in your face hell. Not the hell of bloody conflict (there is a little of that here and there) but of fighting the snow and the cold and the fear of not making it, of dying. Some of the clichés really are a drag, however, such as a little cabin in the middle of nowhere where a bombshell of a French beauty is making bread by hand, a 78 record playing in the background, and she welcomes them (after a brief knife-wielding hesitation) with a kiss on each cheek. It's super sweet, but it's exactly what turns this movie into a fantasy now and then. Great intentions overrun with wishful daydreams."
"quicreva","Null","3","6","8 January 2007"," Better than average WWII film, but trite
","I enjoyed Saints and Soldiers for what it was - a neatly crafted, low budget affair. The producers had the sense not to reach too far with limited resources, and thus produced a very passable but predictable film. The historical accuracy of even small details was a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood inclination to sacrifice truth in the quest for an exciting plot line. The actors all turned in fine performances, too. Where Saints and Soldiers fails is in its predictable plot. We've seen this stuff in all too many earlier war pictures. The band of strangers who have their differences and antagonisms, but overcome these as they are forced to work together; the stereotypic American rural and British soldiers; the rescue of an innocent civilian from the dishonorable intentions of an evil Nazi; getting through enemy lines by impersonating enemy soldiers; the deaths of a couple of our favorite characters during the climax - this is all stock fair, and some earlier WWII movies have certainly done it better. By all means see Saints and Soldiers, but be prepared for a lot of predictable themes and scenes."

If anythings seems incredible, then you know it has some basis in fact.<br/><br/>4 American soldiers escape from being massacred by German soldiers set on a big push through American lines.

Here is why I love low budget film making. <br/><br/>This is a group of people you probably wouldn't want as friends and who start out not liking each other, but by the end of the movie you truly understand the close bond formed by people during war (something Band of Brothers didn't even seem to try to do, just told you it is so).<br/><br/>You also see the true nature of people and that a uniform might make someone an enemy, but it doesn't stop them being human. <br/><br/>If you love war movies, see this movie.

","I love war movies. Heck, I paid nearly a hundred bucks for the Band of Brothers box set. I'm also an atheist, and heavy handed religion really bugs me.<br/><br/>This movie was beautiful.<br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, it's largely character driven. There was more character development in this 90 minute movie then there was in Saving Private Ryan which is almost twice a long. There were only five major characters, and the film is sparse and intimate for the most part. There is no fighting until the final half hour of it, and even the fighting is, for the most part, small and quiet, with characters missing their targets and running out of ammunition and getting hit. There is little blood, little cursing, and no sex. In a lesser filmmaker's hands, this movie would present a very sanitized view of war. Somehow, Ryan Little still makes it gritty and painful.<br/><br/>The movie has a strong religious bent to it. One of the main characters, nicknamed Deacon ('cause he doesn't smoke or drink or do anything fun.) brings the religion into the movie; he had been a missionary in Germany before the war, hence the title of the film. It's a theme that continues, and impacts the ending. The religion in it didn't bother me, as it wasn't preaching or noisy praying or 'my way is better then your way'. It was just there, an integral part of the character. It's why he speaks German and why he's a great shot. It's why he fights.<br/><br/>People die and people are hurt and people are redeemed. There are good Germans and there are bad Germans. The special effects are amazing for such a small budget, and I couldn't believe that the movie had been shot with a hand-held.

","In Mid-December 1944, while Hitler's army blitzkriegs through the Ardennes Forest in Belgium, American sharpshooter Corporal Nathan Greer, known as Deacon, finds himself held captive with over one hundred other soldiers in a snow covered field.<br/><br/>As panic and confusion ensue the German soldiers open fire on the prisoners, in the historical event now known as the ""Malmedy massacre"". Greer, his friend Gordon Gunderson and a handful of others escape the massacre by hiding in the nearby woods.<br/><br/>The small band of soldiers come across a stranded British Intelligence officer with valuable information to be delivered to Allied Forces, further upping the stakes of their already dangerous situation.<br/><br/>With few weapons, no food and a strained camaraderie, this tiny band must take on the unforgiving winter to fight their way back to allied occupied territory.<br/><br/>Once in awhile a small independent film can show us a large part of what Hollywood has forgotten about movie making. A lack of emotions can kill what should have been a great film.<br/><br/>I saw Saints and Soldiers last night after a year and a half wait. An old friend from the COMBAT! Yahoo group (call sign Bayonet) convinced me to see this way back when at the first chance I'd get and I'm glad she did. The theater had all of seven people in it for a 5:45 showing.<br/><br/>My friend Lenny and I saw the film together, and I loved this movie. Lenny's dad fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and this film brought home to him things his dad may have felt 60 years ago. Up until his parents moved into a retirement apartment, Lenny's dad had a W.W.II jeep in his garage (Perhaps he shipped home a part at a time in boxes marked kitchen utensils?) My only negative comment for ""Saints and Soldiers"" is a five to ten second inaccuracy about the ""Malmedy Massacre"" about five minutes into the film. It gives the impression that the US POWs were somewhat at fault for the mowing down of prisoners by machine guns fire. Had I not known about this in advance unlike many other war history buffs that went to see it, I might have been tempted to walk out right then, but we didn't and I'm glad we stayed.<br/><br/>The film does a good job of presenting fresh ideas within a W.W.II story, even if it does remind me of small parts of other war stories in places without being a bit cliché. Surprisingly, Utah as a filming location never looked so much like Belgium before, and with mostly "" history re-en-actors"" making up a large part of the cast, it looked really accurate. I'm waiting to hear from ""Dodger"" or ""Web455"" on how accurate the uniforms are, but I understand that collectors lent the production authentic vehicles, a very nice touch.<br/><br/>As mentioned before the film opens to us seeing the killing ground of the massacre three weeks after the fact. An excavation of frozen bodies from under the snow is in progress. Then we flash back to the day of the event. Had this film stayed true to the facts mentioned earlier, it would have been an improvement, and that's my only complaint in the entire film (Jr's note: Dad's got a fair beef here as it's supposed to be historically accurate, so I'd be docking it too). We follow several survivors as they escape coming together and forge a bond few will ever know in real life.<br/><br/>From now on the film rates top marks from me, but I don't want to get into spoilers and will say no more about it. This film is more about the people that just happen to be involved in a war together. It reminds us that good people & bad can be a part of the sum of any specific group. It also reminds us good people die for things that are worth dying for. And bad people can die for bad things too, and remind us that the innocent (sick, women, children, elderly, refugee, etc.) also die in wars. And finally, there's a lesson about prejudice to be found here as well. The center character of the story is a former missionary of the Church of Later Day Saints, hence the title, but other than knowing he has a bible (or prayer book) and was a missionary, there's no preaching, lecturing or religious intervention in the film to be found. It's not the blood bath of Saving Private Ryan either; it had tactfully handled blood on screen as well as the issue of death. The film also included a moving original score that helps with the gamut of emotions you will feel during the show.<br/><br/>I rate this independently made small budget gem a ""MUST SEE IT"" in the theater on the big screen. Judging by all the Best Picture awards it has racked up at the various film festivals, I think that's a safe statement. The film comes to DVD on May 31st, and it's on my buy list."

In fact, it adds to the mystery, making it more alluring. Only an anti-Mormon with an ax to grind would be offended. I watched it at my daughter's behest and was, well, shocked at its quality: dialog, story, characters and intense battle sequences. I recommend it highly.

"murrowboy","1","2","4","24 November 2018"," Historical inaccuracy/war crime apologism is a dealbreaker
","My main issue with this film is the portrayal of the Malmedy Massacre. This was a well known massacre of American POWs by the Waffen SS, the armed wing of the Nazis, yet for some reason this film seems to blame the Americans for instigating the massacre by attempting to escape and firing the first shot by killing a guard, and having the Germans be regular army, not the criminal Waffen SS. Indeed, the commanding officer of this unit was tried, convicted and jailed for the murders, so this is supported by the historical record. (He was also later assassinated after the war by unknown persons and reasons.) But for some reason, this film chooses to whitewash the whole crime for some reason, for no clear reason. I don't know why this film is trying to be an apologist for a Nazi war crime, so for that reason I don't think it deserves viewing."

","I give this one star for not being the worst war movie I have ever seen, and another star for shooting it for under a million dollars. The entire film is unbelievable, the acting is fair, but the plot is thin and the writers should have done a bit more research. The 101st Airborne was not in that area at that time. The saintly medic defies belief. The character is a bit over the top. I will give it credit for being less preachy than most church films, but they do subtlety get their message through. I cannot recommend it, but if you should find it in the used DVD bin at your local video store, get a pizza, watch it until you are bored, then put on a great WWII movie such as ""Twelve O'Clock High"", or ""The Thin Red Line""."

","If you like movies with lots of scenes of actors walking in seemingly endless snowy woods, then you'll love this movie. Clearly, the studio check book was on another sound stage/studio. It became very apparent not long after the film began that this wasn't a big budget war film because the movie is filled with scenes of snowy fields and trees, and the actors walking through them. The producers needed to save the budget, so you really only get one action sequence at the end, presumably with the reuse of German soldiers who were killed at one part of the action sequence and then used again later (you'll only see two or three soldiers chasing the heroes at any one time, but it's suggested that the heroes are surrounded by a vast force that's never really there). The movie is predictable, you know who will make it and who won't, and you'll be stuck for nine-tenths of the movie looking at snow and listening to stupid dialogue. Oh, and naturally there's a cute French girl 2/3rds of the way through who shows up for no real reason. Bottom line is that if you're looking for a war movie with a plot and action, look elsewhere. But if you like to look at trees and snow and people walking through it aimlessly, then jackpot!

","In December 1944 German soldiers shot 80 American POWs during the Ardennes offensive at Melmedy in Belgium . In terms of murder this was relatively minuscule compared to the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but it was widely quoted at the time because it gave the Western allies the impression the Germans weren't taking any prisoners during this offensive . It should also be remembered the Western allies hadn't come across the numerous Nazi camps on German soil such as Belsen and Dachau . On a similar note and with hindsight it's not just the victors who write history but also Hollywood and the Malmedy massacre has featured occasionally in Hollywood movies with SAINTS AND SOLDIERS being one of them <br/><br/>The massacre at Malmedy sets up the story where four survivors escape the mass murder and find themselves on the run behind enemy lines . Made in 2003 you get the distinct impression this was produced to cash in on the massive success of BAND OF BROTHERS , That said SAINTS AND SOLDIERS holds up in its own right though are some flaws <br/><br/>As a Briton what will rankle with a lot of compatriots is that a British pilot Flt Sgt Oberon Winley is introduced to the story who is an American-centric caricature of the British . First of all if someone in the RAF was a flight sergeant they would have been working class . Only pilot officers and very posh people would be called Oberon . It's also painfully obvious that the posh upper class character is played by someone who is obviously an American actor . It's nice to see an American film acknowledge that the Yanks didn't win the war single handed but couldn't the producers have contacted British Equity ? Mind you half of Easy company were played by British actors in BAND OF BROTHERS so I suppose the serve is returned <br/><br/>Something that might disappoint a lot of people is the fact that there is very little in the film . After the massacre in the start of SAINTS AND SOLDIERS two thirds of the film is taken up by the characters hiding from the Germans with characters talking to one another . It is somewhat refreshing to see a war film that doesn't concern itself with spectacle and incident but anyone tuning in to see bloody big battles will be seriously disappointed since this is a more thoughtful war film"

","'Saints and Soldiers' is not a bad movie but every single element is something we have seen before and that makes it an un-interesting movie. Even the dialogue feels very corny at times, not because it is that bad, but because we have heard a thousand times before. May be the makers should have approached the material a little different to make it interesting, because now it is a movie that I would not recommend.<br/><br/>The story about a couple of US soldiers and one British soldier behind enemy lines after a massacre starts with a very impressive scene; the massacre itself. After this the movie gets very boring for almost an hour, although there are some nice images for us to watch. In this boring part we have some predictable moments that could be suspenseful but were not, and the dialogue that gets annoying. When the action arrives again the movie gets a little better. I liked the cinematography during the fighting sequences so I was able to enjoy these sequences.<br/><br/>To say more about the simple story is not very necessary. You can understand that this story is something we have seen a lot. The massacre, the hiding behind enemy lines without food or weapons, the help of a stranger, the wounded friend, the trick to save themselves.

","""Saints and Soldiers"" presents an intimate, detailed look at one particular incident during the Battle of the Bulge, and its effects on a handful of allied soldiers. The story follows four Americans who escape their German captors and hide out in the woods, where they come upon a Brit pilot with key intelligence information. To help him get this information to their commanders, they embark on a harrowing cross-country journey across German-held territory to reach their own lines.<br/><br/>While there are several battle scenes, and plenty of men dying, this ends up being less an action film and much more a thought-provoking idea film. Of the main characters, one is a devout Christian, one a confirmed atheist, and it is the interplay between these two world views that makes the plot gripping and fascinating. Both are trying to make sense of the horrors they are going through, and while they start out somewhat at odds, they grow closer as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>It's hard not to compare this to ""Saving Private Ryan,"" another story of a small band of GI's going cross-country and battling Germans, trying to reach someone and accomplish something. Yet where ""Ryan"" left me totally depressed and emotionally empty, ""Saints and Soldiers"" rewards the viewer with an uplifting, encouraging message. Both deal with the consequences of pity/mercy on the part of the GI's towards a German prisoner, but with vastly different outcomes. <br/><br/>Every aspect of this movie was remarkably well done. There is visual beauty in the winter landscape, a sparse but nonetheless effective soundtrack (one main theme that is really haunting), great camera and audio work in the action scenes, and genuinely powerful performances by all the key actors. To realize this was all done on a minuscule budget only adds to my admiration.<br/><br/>This movie will leave you thinking about its characters, images, and ideas long after it's faded away. A well-deserved 10/10."
"gradyharp","10","3","8","25 June 2005"," On the Battlefield, Personal Survival and Bonding are Essential
","So many films about war, and especially about WW II, focus on the 'good guys' (read Allied troops) versus 'bad guys' (read Germans) and the monumental confrontations that have gained heroic monikers like D-Day, Normandy, Battle of the Bulge, etc. The film crews spend millions to re-enact these epic battles. At times the individuals within the massive units are brought into focus ('Saving Private Ryan', etc) but primarily they are frontal decoration for the Big Effects created to stun the audience.<br/><br/>Then comes along a small scale independent film like SAINTS AND SOLDIERS and while the battles are there and realistically created, this time they are background settings for this intimate story of the survival of four men and how that survival and a concerted mission serve to allow each to become wholly vulnerable despite all the societal taboos for honest, fragile emotions in men at war. The only other film of this scale and intent that comes to mind is the Peter Berg 1992 film A MIDNIGHT CLEAR.<br/><br/>The story of SIANTS AND SOLDIERS revolves around true events - the massacre of US soldiers at Malmedy, Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. Four young soldiers escape the German horror: Deacon (Corbin Allred), a lad without vices who had been a pre-war missionary (?Mormon) in Berlin and speaks the language; Medic Steven Gould (Alexander Niver) who was forced to give up Medical School to go to war; Gordon Gunderson (Peter Holden) who has bonded with Deacon; Private Shirl Kendrick (Lawrence Bagby) who is a simple Mississippi boy who has never been kissed. Joining them early on is the parachute entrapped Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley (Kirby Heyborne) who has urgent intelligence gained from reconnaissance during a shot-down plane mission. Together these men survive the cold of winter, lack of food and shelter and adequate arms, and set out on a mission to help Winley deliver his coded intelligence to the Allied troops, a fact that could save thousands of lives.<br/><br/>Along the way we learn the various secrets about the individual men's lives back home and their psychological baggage that accompanies them in the snow forests of Belgium. Each has a burden and each learns from the others, agonizing as some are lost, yet compelled to complete their task: Deacon copes with the fact that he mistakenly destroyed a mother and children in a raid, disillusioned Medic Gould has lost faith in a higher being because of the sights of the war and languishes over Deacon's humanity to even the Germans, Gunderson is obsessed with defending Deacon's near fall into shell shock, etc. The now five men are propelled along the course of the war growing from each other's spirits.<br/><br/>The photography for this low budget film is utterly magnificent and was shot by the director Ryan Little himself. The story, based on fact, was altered and adapted for the screen by Geoffrey Panos and Matt Whitaker. The actors are true to ensemble acting - all sensitive, each well performed. And while it is difficult to isolate individuals, the work of Alexander Niver and Corbin Allred is extraordinary. Crowning this deeply moving film is the powerful, sensitive, beautiful musical score by J Bateman and Bart Hendrickson. This is one of those perfectly written, directed, acted, photographed, and scored little wonders that restore faith in the integrity of movies. Highly Recommended for all audiences. Grady Harp"

","At first I was intrigued by the plot behind this film. The basis of this film revolves around the relationship between 5 allied soldiers that find themselves caught behind enemy lines. Therefore, as can be expected, the relationships between these characters are the driving forces of this film. Unfortunately, these roles and the overall film were not well executed. Through shoddy writing and poor acting, the 5 characters communicate in an unbelievably awkward emotional environment which cuts out the legs beneath the potential of this film. Additionally, the ""unique"" editing and filming style is reminiscent of HBO's ""Band of Brothers"" and the bland acting and screen-writing create a disappointing film.

I've recently started looking for the more non blockbuster films in this genre and this film hits the spot. i know the actors are very experienced in TV work, they are not known actors to the majority. this may lend to the films ability to tell the story without any egos, showboating or Hollywood fight scenes. the fight scenes when they come are very realistic, close to those in band of brothers. a couple of characters are killed off without so much of a whimper, realistic. the acting is very good as well, you get to care about the characters. each person has very different traits which lend themselves to the story, which is what this film is, a very good story about events which actually happened during the battle of the bulge. one thing to also note, this film shows us how the war was played out by both sides. not all Germans were maniacs like Hitler, a lot of the axis soldiers were professional soldiers and conscripts (like Rudolf deacons mate), however atrocities like the Malmedy massacre were carried out by SS troops. To understand these views please watch The Downfall starring Bruno Ganz as Hitler, this film (made in Germany) portrays very well the differences as mentioned above. please watch saints and soldiers whether you enjoy war movies or not, these types of stories must be told so that we remember. Lastly, anyone who doesn't believe that stories like this happened - try reading books on war like Ambrose' D-Day and Civilian Soldiers for Allies and even Guy Sajer' Forgotten Soldier for Axis history - they will have you appreciating the sacrifices of the few."

","I could not believe this was made for under a million dollars. A good group of actors who aren't all preening pretty boys and who certainly have a degree of on-screen chemistry. Perhaps the most interesting aspect to this film is the depiction of the Malmedy 'massacre'. This scene has been done before, most notably in 'Battle of the Bulge' where the Germans basically are depicted rounding up the American PoWs, trucking in heavy MGs and mowing nearly all of them down. In S and S, the writers/director portray it as a confused situation where by a bungled escape attempt by one of US troops leads to panic on both sides. When the guard searches the prisoners before the killing, he respects 'Deacon's' bible and picture of his wife and lets him keep them. Hollywood doesn't do things like that. A Hollywood production would have shown the German ripping up the bible and rifle butting the American! So the film's depiction of this scene I believe is more accurate historically in that it was a combination of unfortunate events rather than 'zee evil Nazis lining up zee innocent Americans and firing'.<br/><br/>Although I found the religious theme/debate to it quite interesting, there were some very clichéd moments. It's been mentioned by other posters the Allies killing 30-odd Germans before losing one of their own. I think that the producers/director/writers wanted to 'make up' for the numbers of Americans killed in the 'massacre' scene, which does tend to happen in US war films quite often. It's sort of a 'revenge' thing which just makes the film seem more unrealistic, even though it claims it's 'based on true events'. And how come in modern war films there's good Germans and bad Germans but there's never any bad Americans?? The US forces committed many atrocities against German troops as well but these are never shown on film. Anyway, these are just some criticisms of what overall is a good film. Some have compared it to 'a Midnight Clear' which is fair in some ways but in other ways S and S is superior. Better direction, better shots, better script (though not necessarily better acting I believe) make it a more watchable affair compared to Midnight Clear. Even though the film obviously has big Mormon backing, their beliefs are never even mentioned (apart from the title maybe?) which again impressed me."

After seeing it three times, I started to notice little things that were mentioned in the director's commentary...like the problems they had with the snow, etc. But overall, the quality was much better that I would have expected from an independent film.<br/><br/>Some critics have said that this film was too preachy, or too Mormon. I disagree. I don't think I heard the word Mormon at all in the movie...in fact, the only clues that Deacon was a Mormon was that he was a missionary (if you knew that the Mormon church had missionaries in Germany before WWII), that he did not drink coffee or smoke, and that he came from Snowflake Arizona (a place where there are a lot of Mormons). I would not be surprised if some people just thought that Deacon was just a good Christian. His explanations of his beliefs to the other soldiers could be shared by just about any person who believes in God.<br/><br/>Actually, the only thing I found unbelievable was the LACK of swearing in this movie...not that I didn't mind it, but I would say that soldiers in real life often have a much more colorful vocabulary. However, the lack of swearing, in my opinion, help to focus on the real message of the movie, which is that in war, there are always two sides, and they are BOTH human sides."

Deacon is confronted with a classic moral dilemma: is it our duty to do what is right when the outcome might be bad? For example, does Deacon shoot an unarmed German soldier? The medic Gould asks Deacon: Would he kill Hitler after Deacon admitted that ""they are just like us only in a different uniform""? Deacon raises his Bible and says to the medic (Alex Polinsky: Perfect Fit, Law and Order)""You are the one with a lot of questions, I think you need this book more than me.""<br/><br/>This movie is for fans who have seen every war genre movie.

The message was so simple: we are good--they are bad. <br/><br/>The viewer must understand what happens to the man in the uniform: Sargent York, Das Boot, Mr. Rogers, The Big Red One, The Deer Hunter, and SPR.<br/><br/>The war movie aficionado must empathize with what happens to men who have been through war: The Best Years of Our lives, Born on the Fourth of July, or Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>If you have made it through all of these movies you will understand that there is never a good war or a bad peace (B. Franklin). <br/><br/>What happens in the zone between war and peace are well done in Saints and Soldiers. The intimacy in this movie is seen in the details: the psychological battle between the Brit with a cigarette and the Yank who wants a cigarette, telling the German guard ""Mein Frau"" when the German guard is going to throw away Deacon's picture of his wife (the Guard slips it back into Deacons pocket). <br/><br/>This movie is on the A-list above Band of Brothers, Windtalkers, and Saving Private Ryan.

Stumbled across it on the History Channel this past drill weekend. I missed the early scene of the actual massacre. I'm curious as to why they let something like that slip, especially with all the attention to detail they seemed to expend on other aspects of the film. This is one of the few films on the Bulge (Band of Brothers being another) that seemed to capture the amount of snow that was reported to be there. I wonder where they filmed it. I think that they must have filmed it here in the States because the woods are not as orderly as they are in the actual battle area."
"gtc83","7","2","5","20 November 2005"," Pretty good
","This movie starts out with the Malmedy massacre in WWII. It's portrayed as if it began as some sort of shoving match that got badly out of hand. I found that a bit odd, they certainly left out the part where half of the 80+ GI's wound up with pistol bullets in their heads after the Germans gave them a coup de grace shot. After this, we follow the only survivors of the massacre as they attempt to make it back to Allied lines. They're your typical bunch, a farm boy, a smart, experienced sergeant, a shell shocked religious guy, and an agnostic medic. On the way, they meet up with a British pilot who has proof that the Battle of the Bulge is about to begin (the Allies don't know it at the time). So, they're in even more of a hurry to make it back to friendly lines.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about any sort of important battle - the information possessed by the British pilot really isn't important to the plot in any real way. It's a movie about guys under stress, arguing about the existence of God, reconciling, arguing about the Germans being ""just like us"" vs. being horrible murderers, etc. It reminded me very much of that old TV show ""Combat"". These characters are quite enjoyable to watch for the 90 minutes of the film; they seem well drawn and have some depth. There's some nice winter scenery, though the film doesn't make use of it in any spectacular way. It's certainly not Heroes of Telemark or Where Eagles Dare. A few things bothered me, like the fact that the German soldiers are such lousy shots that they lose 10 or 20 soldiers for every Allied soldier killed. Not that I like to see Allied soldiers get killed, but it's just not very realistic. Also, the German soldier they meet, who JUST HAPPENS to be good buddies with the religious GI. That's way too much of a coincidence, and the way he acts afterwards really didn't seem believable to me at all.<br/><br/>But, overall, it's not a bad movie. I enjoyed it, though it certainly doesn't rank up there with some of the classic WWII films."

","Last night, the History Channel aired ""Saints and Soldiers"" on its network. An hour or so prior to its time slot, I decided to read all the reviews and comments displayed here. The fact that it was directed by individuals of the Mormon faith (I'm not too keen on religion) somewhat discouraged me from bothering spending my time to watch the movie at all! ; however, I have always had a wonderful knack of judging for myself, and boy was I glad I saw the film! A clean-cut version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" , complete with authentic weapons, uniforms right down to the SdKfz 3/4-tracked vehicles of the Wehrmacht (all the way in Utah! - what museum did they borrow them from??) The action scenes were impeccable, and there were moments of suspense whenever German troops would wander close by. And last, but by no means least, for unknown actors, the performances were outstanding,and the dialog just as well, in particular the occasional philosophical conversations between the agnostic medic and the religious private. A magnificent cast indeed. My wife and I enjoyed it profoundly and I am contemplating buying the DVD!!!"

"birck","8","2","5","16 October 2005"," A pleasant surprise
","I haven't read all the comments on this film yet, but I agree with most of the ratings I've read. I knew absolutely nothing about the film, saw it at the video store, and picked it because it is a WWII story, and the jacket blurbs made it sound like ""The Great Raid"": true story, awards and all that. Halfway through, one character is revealed to be devoutly religious in a way that only applies to Mormons (as far as I know). But there the matter is left. The LDS Church is not named, as I recall, and in any case, the script is securely in the ""War story"" camp. So any carping about ""religious tract! Theological hogwash!"" are just that-hogwash. <br/><br/>The Spoiler in this review refers not to the film, which I found quite convincing, well-done, well-shot, well-written, well-edited and well-acted, but to the Awful Truth revealed by the ""making of"" featurette tacked on to the DVD: It appears, from the featurette, that very few of the principals in the film have much acting experience; the screenwriters have very slim portfolios, the director also served as DP and cameraman, most of the soldier extras on both sides were played by volunteer re-enactors, they had one-count 'em-ONE P-51 Mustang to roar overhead (Too high. You could have added a few more in Post, guys) at the end of the film, which was made for less than a million dollars, and it was shot entirely in Utah!<br/><br/>On the other hand: Utah is fine as a location; it does the job. It doesn't look like a cheap film; Volunteer re-enactors did great work in Gettysburg and Cold Mountain (Romanians), as they did here, The script worked well; the director, Ryan Little, did a magnificent job with non-professionals and professionals, and deserves to be offered films with bigger budgets.

","This is a well thought out and done piece of 2nd world war, placed at the Battle of the Bulge, which seems to fascinate American Movie people in a way, that it was a near defeat of the American Army never expected and only prevented by strong will to hold out in dire circumstances until relieved by Patton and better whether allowing air superiority to kick in. This however, is an almost ""private"" affair, a small group of already captured soldiers escaping from Prisonship, collecting on the way a shot-down or crashed pilot with an important message, which strengthens their need to get back to their own lines. There are a lot of small event, only 2 major fighting events but also a lot of good character study. Good to know, that American movie making has a lot to offer in this area, next to the superb Band of Brothers and the surprising sleeper ""When Trumpets Fade"".

"ANDREWEHUNT","7","2","5","27 July 2005"," Very good movie, but slightly overrated (and its low budget definitely shows)
","Saints and Soldiers (S&S) was a powerful film with some unforgettable moments, but it wasn't quite the masterpiece that some of its more devoted fans claim it is. The 1992 film A Midnight Clear was similar, in many respects, to S&S, but better, in my view. The acting in S&S, for the most part, was solid. The real standout performance was delivered by Peter Alse Holden as Gordon Gunderson, who managed to convey warmth, pathos and humor in a way that was vaguely reminiscent of Jeff Daniels. Corbin Allred was also fine as the tormented, deeply religious corporal who served an LDS mission to Germany years earlier and has at least one major skeleton in his closet. One warning: Kirby Heyborne's British accent was absolutely appalling--not believable for one second. He almost ruined the film, though he probably gave it his best shot. This film is not, repeat NOT, a Mormon propaganda film, as some of its detractors have suggested. I'm *not* a Mormon, although many of my friends and family are, and I watched it with my brother, who is LDS. S&S, in fact, depicts an ongoing argument about the afterlife (or lack thereof) between the religious Deacon and the atheistic Gould, yet at no point does the film attempt to answer the questions raised in their exchanges, which is the indication of a compelling movie. Moreover, the debate was convincing and effectively handled. Not for a moment did the film preach. Ultimately, S&S is a deeply humanistic antiwar film that conveys a crucial message about the importance of maintaining compassion and not vilifying or objectifying one's enemies (in this case, of course, the Germans) during a time of war. Viewers would do well to apply its timeless lessons to the war in Iraq right now. The film was definitely hampered by a low budget. Not all of the European characters were particularly believable or portrayed very effectively. And some of the main actors performed more admirably than others. It won't stand up alongside Hollywood's finest war films (e.g., Saving Private Ryan, All Quiet on the Western Front, Platoon, etc.). But it's a worthwhile attempt that will, with time, hold its own among the better war films."
"pvadoll","9","2","5","24 June 2005"," This movie deserves MORE recognition than Hollywood has given it!
","Prior to watching this movie, I had expected it to be just another WWII movie depicting bloody, disfigured soldiers squirming around in agony and soldiers ceaselessly firing their rifles in most of the scenes, (i.e. Saving Private Ryan). But I was pleasantly enthralled by the realism and humanistic emotions that the characters displayed in this movie. The director and the actors did a fantastic job portraying unexpected emotions that I, as a viewer, would not normally see nor expect in a war movie. I was actually touched by the personal conflicts and friendships that these 5 main characters shared. There were even a few witty moments in the movie, particularly between Winley and Kendrick, that I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>I was even more impressed that this movie had the look of a 'big budget' film when it was completed with only a budget of a little under $1 million dollars! (Thanks to a group of extremely talented and creative people, CGI was not needed!)<br/><br/>Aside from the occasional ""mumbled, incoherent dialogues"" and the disproportionately loud sound effects, this UNDERRATED movie deserves MORE recognition from Hollywood than it has gotten from the various film festivals!

"pelt1971","8","2","5","15 June 2005"," Excellent
","What makes me enjoy war movies of this type is not the violence or action but that they make me appreciate my freedom. There are the fun war movies like Kelly's Heros etc. that are for entertainment. It's one of my favorite war movies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Saints and Soldiers make one think about what others have sacrificed and given, even if they didn't want to, so that we can be free. But one important distinction about Saints and Soldiers is that we realize that the ""bad guys"" are for the most part just like the ""good guys"". Certainly what the German army was fighting for was terrible but the individual German soldier was just as likely to not want to be at war and would rather be at home with family. Individual soldiers on both sides would likely be friends if not for the circumstances that bring them together. See this film and be grateful for your freedoms and remember that it didn't just happen. Someone had to fight for it and thousands have died for it."
"Buddy-51","6","2","5","12 June 2005"," well intentioned but weakly executed
","Based on a true story, ""Saints and Soldiers"" is an honorable failure, a low-keyed, understated film set in the closing days of World War II. Five men - four Americans and a Brit - are trapped behind enemy lines, desperately attempting to get a message to the Allied troops who are stationed miles away across a frozen wilderness.<br/><br/>This is a small-scale war film in which character and theme are more important than battles scenes and big-picture strategy. This is both the strength and the weakness of the film, for while the men talk about God and the Bible and the brotherhood of man, the script too often feels as if it is straining to make a philosophical or theological point and not allowing the men to truly develop as living, breathing human beings. Instead, they come across too much like mouthpieces for their respective causes - the committed Christian vs. the cynical atheist, for instance. Although well-intentioned, the movie could use a bit more sophistication in both its dialogue and its characterizations. The revelations and lessons also feel a mite trite at times, as if we didn't already know that we are all just the same under the various and sundry uniforms, languages, accents etc. Moreover, the actors, for the most part, seem to be reciting most of their lines by rote.<br/><br/>Although, in many ways, I admire what the makers of ""Saints and Soldiers"" were trying to do - going beyond the surface concerns of the traditional war film to explore the psychology of the common soldier - the film, quite frankly, simply doesn't have the depth and intelligence it needs to bring it off."

","Being a fan of war movies, I was drawn to attend this one, too, by the recommendation of a dear friend. There's nothing like watching war on the big screen to appreciate how hellish it was and is! The story was an emotional-roller coaster. In truth, I never felt like I was bored -- not even for a second. The actors, none of them that I recognize as Hollywood superstars, did a superb job, and the story was told without the typical gore associated with war movies. Yes ... people were being shot, and blood was shown, but not to the extent that is typical from most Hollywood war movies. A PG-13 war movie? DEFINITELY POSSIBLE!<br/><br/>Some of the most endearing scenes were those that embodied the true meaning of ""brother in arms"" -- something that is often hard for most people who've never served in the thick of the fight to understand, but something that is easily conveyed via the discourse and obvious emotion that's shared between the characters.<br/><br/>Also interesting was the spin of how not all enemies are really ""bad."" Of course most WWII movies make all Japanese to be evil and all Germans to be stamps of Hitler. This movie, however, makes you realize that this is so far from the truth. I left thinking that the world as I know it is not so ""black and white"" and was grateful for the reminder.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie hasn't gotten the attention that it deserves, but it really is worth the time, effort and energy."

While I was in the Marine Corps, I had Protestant buddies reading the Bible in a hole in the middle of nowhere while we froze our nether regions off.<br/><br/>He mentioned he was a missionary in Berlin before the war. My Aunts best friend went to some jungle in the middle of South America on a Baptist mission to build churches for those who couldn't afford one.<br/><br/>Religion is not ""crammed down our throats"" in this film. It is based on actual events. It shows that even during times of horror and war, morals and courage can both be intermingled.<br/><br/>For those who will criticize this movie due to the fact that it was filmed by ""Mormons"", maybe you should get to know the religion a bit better.

The animated post-film Q+A session ran the clock out rather than running short on questions from the audience.<br/><br/>The film is about a handful of Allied soldiers escaping through a frozen forest near Malmedy, Belgium. Along the way, each has their morals and beliefs tested. From the literally haunted look of Nathan 'Deacon' Greer (Corbin Allred) to the attitude of Shirl 'I just want to get back and kill Germans' Kendrick(Larry Bagby), the characters are rich and memorable. Many of the encounters that are portrayed in the film are actual events reported by veterans and then brought to life. In fact, actor Peter Holden is playing his grandfather in the role of Sgt. Gordon Gunderson.<br/><br/>What the film portrays in good fashion is that there is a morality in place in the average soldier during war. They have to wrestle with their beliefs on a daily basis and in ways we civilians both discount and cannot comprehend. In Saints and Soldier, the idea of higher values is depicted in a non-denominational way leaving the viewer free to infer whatever religion they feel is appropriate. Even the Germans, the necessary antagonists in any European Theatre WW2 film, do not appear as cardboard cutouts. Granted, they are the enemy and do bad things but the film centers on the Allies. The Germans WERE the Bad Guys, after all. That being said, there =are= acts of humanity depicted to support the underlying morality of the story.<br/><br/>Although the film was shot on a shockingly low budget, production values are exceedingly high. Everything ""looked right"" to my eye though I am sure someone in the audience will spot an out-of-place collar tab somewhere. The scenery brought a chill, the music was evocative, the battle scenes were gripping and the sound editing had people twisting in their seats trying to locate the source.<br/><br/>All in all, Saints and Soldiers is an excellent film that should be seen on the big screen and then added to any history buff's DVD collection when video release time comes. It has a reserved spot on my video shelf next to The Winter War, The Longest Day and All Quiet on the Western Front."

","When S&S is compared to other war movies, S&S isn't bloody like Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. I've also linked S&S to the movie, The Thin Red Line in which there is a lot of human emotion and deep thinking, but throw in some Mormon influence.<br/><br/>What makes S&S different from LDS films is that even though the main character is LDS, the film subtlely puts in the beliefs of the Mormons. I have seen a lot of LDS films (both in Seminary and in the local theater) but S&S doesn't put face forward the LDS beliefs. Rather, you would have to infer them.<br/><br/>For example, Deacon carries around a book and I inferred that it was a Book of Mormon. The LDS religion also has a strong focus on the family, and that is shown by Deacon. The other soldiers talk about how deacon doesn't smoke (Word of Wisdom) and missionary work is shown between the German soldier and Deacon.<br/><br/>I liked the location, seeing that i've actually been there. Just to let you know, i'm just 15 minutes away from the filming location of S&S. Robert Redford's resort, Sundance, was used and is a very nice play to walk around, especially during the fall season.<br/><br/>I'd recommend watching this film if you are into war films. It's not as suspenseful as most of the war movies, but it gets a message across. I'm not sure why this movie would even get an R rating the first time (though it has been reevaluated to a PG-13)"

","I love this take on a war story. I like explosions and action as much as the next guy, but it was refreshing to get a look at soldiers when they aren't running away from exploding tanks in slow motion. The relationships between the characters were not only well-acted, but also realistic. This film also did a great job of showing, in the very few actual confrontations, that war is between humans who all think they're right, not denizens of pure good and pure evil fighting to eliminate the other. I also liked the subtle details that showed that the director paid attention SPOILER(at first I agreed with my friend that it was unrealistic for the medic to use a gun, but then I realized that he missed every shot, like a real person who had never fired a gun in war would have). If you're really into weapons and war history, you'll notice inaccuracies with the props and such, and it sometimes got hard to keep track of who was who. Another thing I didn't like is the sound balance. It was very hard to hear the characters at some points, especially crucial lines that, if missed, make the viewer wonder what their reasoning was for a certain action. All in all, this is an excellent movie about ""human-ness"" in war and a refreshing take on the war movie genre, but it does have its flaws."

","Saints & Soldiers tells the story of few soldiers behind enemy lines trying to make it through by supporting & understanding each other,the age old message being delivered with it..team work is always above your own comforts when lives are at stake.The film is merely 80minutes long but is so well made that at the end you feel satisfied & more or less emphatic.It depicts that during a time of crises even small things have big values which we don't understand unless we need them.In every war there are proficient soldiers on both side who obviously treat each other with disdain & hatred but exceptions are always there,the film is sort of a short story covering all the above aspects at some levels,its a brilliant movie and from my side i give it perfect score as far as entertainment goes.Good story,great performance,good subject matter...pretty much sums it all up,i am sure that you r gonna have a great time enjoying this one...."
"rolivire-1","9","2","6","13 February 2010"," The truth about the Malmedy ""massacre""
","Like ""A midnight clear"" another (rare) convincing Second World war war movie from the USA. Thanks to the members of a reenactment group in the USA the German soldiers of December 1944 (USA citizens!) are as authentic as they could be in their different camouflage outfits. This is exceptional for a war movie! They even speak more or less real German and even behave like Germans did.<br/><br/>The so called Malmedy Massacre is now revealed as a German reaction at panic driven US POW's which grab a rifle and shot a German soldier. The reaction was the (understandable) opening of fire from the Germans. They also were on the move and could not wait for following troops to deliver the POW's to the rear. So the incident provoked a fierce reaction. Like the treatment US paratroops in Normandy exercised on German POW's, the treatment of prisoners was not always in the line of the Geneva Convention and they were frequently shot by partisans, Germans, US and Soviet soldiers. The US soldiers (42th & 45th divisions) behaved outright criminal in the Biscari, Webling and Dachau incidents. They shot intentionally a comparable number of POW's, but did that on purpose (= murder). In Malmedy most US soldiers were not shot but already killed by long range tank canon fire before the incident. Many (43) survived however in the meadow. So the incident served the US Army well there after, masking their own bloodshed. When it became known it also stiffened the US opposition in the Ardennes.......<br/><br/>The firefight in the château near Lanin village the US soldiers shot a dozen Germans and lost two of their own. This firefight is very realistic although the losses are a little bit one sided but not so one sided compared to the bulk of the other ""realistic""(?) war movies like Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>A fine realistic moving low budget movie with beautiful scenery and dramatic and beautiful music."

","This is one of those ""diamond in the rough"" motion pictures, which sadly didn't get the big Hollywood budget and box office attracting stars. I had never even heard of this movie or the factual event portrayed until I was idly perusing through the movie database.<br/><br/>There are nay Sayers complaining about this movie being predictable and clichéd. But guess what? The events portrayed are based on fact and yes, life itself is often predictable and clichéd. If you went to see this movie to see a shoot 'em up WWII epic with predictable plot twists, sorry that you wasted your time on this one. This is by no means your typical ""Saving Private Ryan"" type WWII movie, with it's gratuitous blood and guts scenes shot all over the screen. However, if you enjoy a thought provoking portrayal of what can happen to one's sensibilities during periods of extreme stress, then by all means this fits the bill.<br/><br/>The story centers on two GI'sone is a bible carrying sharp shooting sniper, and the other an atheist medic. What's important in this story is not necessarily the opposing viewpoints of the two, but more important the human interactions that take place between them and the others involved in the plot. The actors were all quite capable of portraying the events of this story, with a particularly solid performance by Corbin Allred (Deacon). In the end, the differences in ideology didn't matter. What really mattered is how human beings treat and respect each other. There is a lesson that can be taught to our young people from this story, hopefully before they are laid claim to the cynicism and inlaid cultural biases already too prevalent among adults."

","First off this movie does not belong to the regular war genre. Second off its probably the best movie made with a one million budget. This movie does not have an awe inspiring display of tanks or edge-of-your-seat dogfights but what it does have is authentic world war weaponry and some of the best acting you might see. You would not have heard of these actors ever nor would you have heard the director's name. But, believe it or not this movie offers some splendid action along with heart wrenching scenes of emotional bondage. These guys in the movie are not green berets or special forces but their roles and acting make them very very special. Rather than what men can do in a war this movie shows what war can do to men. the title of the movie is apt and this movie is splendidly shows the cohesive nature of human relationships.

"Fintan-Kearney","2","2","6","24 May 2008"," its a student film....not a feature.
","First i must say well done to get a low budget, non-studio film out there. It is important to make and have alternative films getting made. I I only give it a 2 because its a low budget feature, not an easy thing to get made at the best of times. <br/><br/>HOWEVER, in saying that, just because it doesn't have lots of money behind it does not mean that it is aloud to get away with being a badly made, badly thought through movie. This is a student film, simple as that. I am genuinely very shocked to see that people have said it is their favourite war movie, better than Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers...you must be joking me. <br/><br/>If you don't have a story you have no film. And this film has no story. IT looked like it was sent out to be made on its first draft. Very 2-D and extremely generic, predictable and lacking in tension character development or even characters for that matter. As i read earlier and agree with from other comments, the tense moments were not tense, you did not care about the characters. <br/><br/>The lines all seemed forced by the actors. And actors can only work with what they are given. And their acting wasn't all that bad. The characters have no depth, neither does the story. What they writers where going for had been done so many times before and nothing new or different was added to them. <br/><br/>The filming was confusing. Usually a pan or a cut or a track is for a reason, it is instigated or prompted by a movement, a character turning, and truck driving by etc, but here as these soldiers ""strolled"" through the forest camera movements came in at random, distracting from the story. Bringing you out of the illusion...if there was even one from the beginning. <br/><br/>Last of all the sound design was catastrophic. Levels where all over the place, and when guns fired at times there was no sound, maybe this was for dramatic effect but it didn't work. all i could think was ""where is the gun shot"". <br/><br/>Low budget films are important, but that is no excuse to waste time and money on a story that goes no where but following people wandering round a forest, and that is all that happens.<br/><br/>Nothing to rush out to watch."

I hadn't been choked by a Second World War movie since Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" that dictated the art of war and value of life lost and saved through a means of effort due in the war period.<br/><br/>If you're an avid fan of Multi-Award winning ""Saving Private Ryan"" you can almost look upon this additional movie as a set bonus - Why? Because the astronomical effects and camera movements dictate the feeling that you're actually with them, alike the movie - Saving Private Ryan. Not just good effects have you reminiscing about prior war movies, but the acting and stage play of the actors have you set in motion to believing their every word, making you realise, they had a good script to play with.<br/><br/>At times I must admit, the realism fails to keep me entertained? Mainly because at some points, clichés have me cringing in my shoes, knowing all too well what's about to happen next, but overall, the thrilling intense 'drama' of the movie does have you pinched at the sofa until the end, perhaps leaving you wondering after the movie -- Did they really experience that? <br/><br/>A big thumbs up from me, enjoyable to watch, amusing to follow and great effects - what more could you ask for?"

Whilst not particularly new or original (war is hell, Germans are people too, other such revelations) this is a satisfyingly grim and bleak look at a grim and bleak time, well mode and beautifully photographed. Apparently some people found the film to be Mormon propaganda and, whilst I did find some of the Christian sentimentality to be a bit 'in your face' I'm not sure what makes it Mormon as opposed to any other faction of that particular delusion. And it didn't detract from the story sowho cares?

"yossarian500","7","2","6","26 May 2007"," Great example of an independent film
","For being a (relatively) low-budget, independent film, I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent production values of this movie. However, I couldn't help but think that the dialog was quite amateurish. It kept pulling me out of the movie.<br/><br/>Not bad writing, mind you. But the script was the weakest part of the movie by far. The arguments made by the characters were not compelling, and often seemed incomplete. Very little of it seemed natural. I kept thinking it was like something that me or my friends would have written. That is, it was only okay. The dialog written for the British pilot was especially bad. Hard to explain, but I think it would have been better had it gone through a few more re-writes.<br/><br/>That said, I did enjoy Saints and Soldiers. It was very short, probably the shortest war movie I've ever seen (only 90 minutes). In that respect, it fills a niche when you're in the mood for a WWII movie but don't want to sit through a 3-hour epic, and you've watched through all the episodes of Band of Brothers a dozen times. :-) It had an interesting premise, but it just didn't follow through as well as it could have.<br/><br/>I had to edit this to add a note about the British accent. I completely agree with other reviewers of this movie; the accent is beyond awful, and it didn't help that the lines they gave him were as hackneyed as they possibly could have been. Frankly, I don't see why they couldn't have made it an American pilot anyway. If I had been the director I would have made that switch the very second I heard that guy say a line. :-)"

","An extremely well done movie. If you understand that it is loosely based on historical facts then you won't get all hung up on the few inaccuracies. For example, one reviewer objected to the medic carrying a rifle, but in real life medics were known to carry weapons, especially considering the scene where an ambulance crew was killed in the no holds barred German offensive. Medics aren't issued rifles, but are allowed to protect themselves and the wounded. The characters are appealing and their actions/dialog realistic. I was thoroughly entertained even though there were times that the movie was very sad. However, in the end, their goal was achieved and the movie had a nice ending. The only part that bothered me was the way the movie showed the massacre taking place. It showed the shooting starting by accident, when history has pretty much proved that the German unit commander ordered the execution of the American troops because he wouldn't allow his unit to be slowed by POWs. It seems like this war crime was softened to make it more PC. Also of note, if you believe Deacon to be LDS, understand that many missionaries who served in peacetime Germany did pick up fluent German and served in the US army."

","I always enjoy films about the Battle of the Bulge. It was the worst of times for Americans in the entire European war, so this battle always provides special opportunities for extra---but realistic---plot tension. When it's about the Battle of the Bulge, we never know whether our characters will be rubbed out, taken prisoner, taken prisoner, then rubbed out, tangle with clever Germans wearing the wrong uniforms (who also speak perfect English and know who won the World Series) or whether our heroes will just manage to hang on against a terrible whipping in awful weather. All of these elements make this a particularly rich venue for wartime drama.<br/><br/>This movie was apparently shot for less than a million dollars, but it's a far better film than that modest budget would suggest. Even with unknown actors, it takes real skill to put a period piece with special effects on the screen for that amount of money. Nice cinematography.

Not one thing in the movie mentioned any religion, so I don't understand why he/she thought that it did. One character served a mission and taught a family. Many religions send missionaries abroad to teach. He's also seen reading scriptures. Many people do. And, if I was ever in a war and behind enemy lines, I'd sure be doing some praying myself.

"ucantseeme1029","8","1","4","15 March 2011"," A good rainy day flick worth checking out
","This movie actually sailed underneath the radar for me when it was released, as I had never heard of it until I seen it on Netflix, but long story short I'm glad I came across this. The opening scenes start out at the Malmedy massacre in WW II, where a small group of US soldiers manage to escape the slaughter. But, the hiccup in that fact is that they also happen to be behind enemy lines so they were essentially out of the frying pan and into the fire so to speak. While trying to navigate back they stumble across a downed Royal Air Force Pilot who is carrying vital intel that they must get back to the Allied Forces.<br/><br/>The characters, while predictable and cheesy at times, were likable in my opinion. I liked their interactions even though at some points it seemed too contrived or forced to be really believable. But while the cast are not a well known group, I liked the work they did. To get a good mind set of this type of movie, think of it as a movie more about characters that happen to be in WW2 rather than a straight up WW2 movie. This movie is more character driven and the hook is that you wait to see if they make it or not. There are even some moral interactions between them and a few Nazis. While its been done before it was still and interesting aspect. Don't expect them to storm the enemy lines yelling ""git some"" while carrying 60lb machine guns while Nazi body parts and dirt coat the camera lenses. They are outnumbered and out gunned and rely on stealth through 95% of the movie. They do manage to kick some ass at points when the action picks up, but this is not an action driven movie.<br/><br/>As far as action goes, this movie isn't for everyone. If you're expecting typical Hollywood guts, butts, and elbows flying across the screen this is not your flick. It is PG-13, which to be honest, is a welcome relief considering a lot of war movies rely too much on the gore. We don't need to know what happens to the human body when hit with a grenade in close up detail. We know what happens. We've seen it countless times in past movies. While some people do get shot and blown up in this movie you never actually see those things depicted in a gory mist, just explosions and squibs. <br/><br/>If your looking for history buff accuracies you will also be disappointed as this story is more fiction based with fictional characters and moments simply inspired by some real stuff thrown into it. It has factual ""inspirations"" but don't expect details fine tuned down to microscopic levels. <br/><br/>This movie was limited budget and on that note they did an admirable job. This is not Band of Brothers, or Saving Private Ryan that tell the story in hours and hours...Saints and Soldiers had little time and money to tell a story in an hour or so and did so respectably. To me this movie skims the boundaries between B Movie and A Movie. You can tell if they had more resources and time, certain aspects could have pushed this movie to be a bit better. I was still impressed and enjoyed it however, and I have high respect for what they managed to accomplish. If you want a good short story about some soldiers just trying to survive and finish a mission that type of mind set will make it more enjoyable."

They finally arrive at a home where the owner lets them have some refuge, after coming across a British soldier (Kirby Hayborne). She also allows a German soldier, who happened to have met one of the Americans before the war.<br/><br/>Now the soldiers, one of which is carrying vital information, have to get back to allied territory or die.<br/><br/>This is not your typical war movie. Mostly because the story focuses on the relationships between the soldiers. There are battle scenes in this movie, but they're spread out through out the movie.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are pretty authentic. Loud, with lots of action. The blood shed is fairly tame, and there's nothing gory. One of the main characters is a medic, and has to deal with some bad wounds. However, the wounds are not graphic.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of this movie is the performances of the main cast. The main cast is simply fantastic. You actually feel as if you are looking at people who have bonded after a long time, under intense circumstances. Their on-screen chemistry is one of the best I've seen recently. I can't say that one of the actors stood out from the rest, only because they are all great in their roles. Not one of them were unbelievable.<br/><br/>The clothing was very authentic looking. In fact, the clothing, as well as weaponry and vehicles were provided by WWII collectors. Also, re-en-actors were used in many battle scenes.<br/><br/>Music in this movie is used nicely. Many musical pieces are used nicely to enhance the scene. I can't remember any musical pieces though.<br/><br/>Some people may have a problem with the cast being a group of unknowns. This movie is a low-budget independent film, so a big name star was unattainable. However, this cast is fantastic in this film, and you quickly forget that you don't know these actors.<br/><br/>I would suggest that parents not allow younger children see this movie. There is some violence, and one character is suffering from battle fatigue which kids may not comprehend. There is no swearing in this film, with the exception of an era racial slur against Germans.<br/><br/>I watched this movie over on Hulu, where you could check it out on as well. However, if your connection is too slow to stream video, and happen across this film, check it out -- if your first couple of choices are not available. I wouldn't Netflix this, only because of the wait if you already have a long list for the company to choose from."

The movie in some sense gives us an emotional feeling towards what it really likes to be a soldier and at the same time emphasizes that even in life TRUST is a very important factor in every friendship. so for me this movie deserves a 10 over 10 in my rating and surely it deserves an Oscar!!! The movie has a quality story line and has something to say. Peoples should watch it not only by its plot but also on how the ACTORS portray their rules because they were GREAT... GOOD JOB!!! <br/><br/>viner from the Philippines"

","Without too much glitz and glamor, ""Saints"" puts a new dramatic feel to the WorldWar2 epics that we have all come to enjoy and some unfortunately hate. The beginning starts fast and action packed then turns to the character's personalities. I felt indifferent to the subtleties involved in character development. I saw this on hulu so there were some commercial interruptions but I was steadily tuned in to the dialogue and dramatic moments of religious overtones.Some WorldWar2 epics take the acting out of major event that changed lives forever. I am happy to this approach wasn't followed in ""Saints"".The fear, bigotry, camaraderie, and pure honor for one another came together in a great story. I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it as a WorldWar 2 story add."

","Let me start by telling you what you wont get: you won't get non-stop action, no large scale battles á la Private Ryan opening, no Hollywood mega stars and no breath taking special effects shots. If you're looking for that - rent Private Ryan, Hamburger Hill or Thin Red Line.<br/><br/>This is more like a relation drama set in WWII. What you will get is good acting, adequate special effects and beautiful scenery (given you find forests in the winter beautiful). The movie is almost cozy at times.<br/><br/>It's a well told story that is allowed to have it's own tempo. If you'd like an decent, intelligent film and don't mind the story taking it's time - then this is a good one."

","First the accolades. Wow. A movie this good for under $1million. Amazing. And you know, these actors were very very good. And I'm guessing they didn't get paid $5mil for the film. Funny, eh? A good script, and good people working on the film made something that is this good and it is something they can and will be incredibly proud to have been part of. While that doesn't pay the bills, there was enough distribution to help out, I would hope. <br/><br/>I actually really liked the fact that it wasn't a blood bath. (THANK YOU) And it absolutely is something to share w/ kids and family. While it is a minuscule part of what happened in WWII, it nonetheless gives a flavor for what our forefathers endured in fighting for their freedom. <br/><br/>I understand that folks are upset about the religious overtones (and frankly I'm not a fan of any organized religion), however, I think the perspective of the filmmakers are correct in suggesting that religious people fought in WWII. And I see absolutely nothing wrong with putting someone like Deacon in such a film. (the coffee might have been pushing...but again...acceptable)<br/><br/>It is a bummer that folks who are disappointed by religion and by not seeing legs blown off decrease the overall rating of a fabulous film. I hope you ignore the zealots and have the tenacity to form your own opinion. See the film...it is definitely worth it."

My grandfather was in WW II and I could not help but think about those who served bravely. The acting was superb and it is amazing to see such a movie of high caliber that was made on such a small budget. The comments about Mormons and the like are not appropriate. You could not even tell Corbin Allred was a Mormon. He just appeared to be a tormented yet religious person. Watch it without distractions. It's worth it."

","After watching this movie, and then looking up what budget it had i realized what an extraordinary achievement it was. The director managed to recreate the battle of buldge pretty well. The snow, vechles, uniforms and weapons are all accurate and correct. The story is pretty good aswel, even though the film is short you still have enough time to get to know the characters a bit. The special effects were brilliant and the scenes well timed.<br/><br/>In conclusion this movie may no have had to huge budget of Saving Ryan or the big name cast of Black Hawk Down but its certainly earned its place with the top class WW2 movies. The less detailed gore is in this movie an asset to it, since your not overwhelmed by gore and blood. This gives you a nice chance to focus on the characters and story. Over all 10/10.

One of if not the best WW2 film I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The way I see this, that every decision comes with either a reward, or a consequence. A consequence that will back fire, and a reward that god himself couldn't hand out.

","A 'must see' Being tired after a long week of school and harsh soccer practice in the freezing cold , I was in no mood that night to rent a 'chick-flick' with my friends. It was not until we had skimmed the New Release section of Blockbuster that I decided it was useless to look for a good movie when I knew Saving Private Ryan was somewhere in the 'Action' section. One of my friends and I are hard core action and war movie lovers, thus, Steven Spielberg's film was on my mind. After picking up The Sentinel, which I'd seen before and mildly enjoyed, the two of us scanned the action section, almost all of them we'd already seen. It was the intriguing DVD cover that caught my eye and after reading the back we rented it hoping not to have wasted money on a disappointment.<br/><br/>Luckily the movie was FAR from inadequate and moved up my 'favorites' list quickly. It was astonishing, and believe it or not, we watched it numerous times that weekend, to the point where we could mimic most of the parts. Call me obsessive if you want, but rarely watch TV or find a good movie like this one, which I think was made with under a million dollar budget. I recommend that you watch this, it is remarkable.<br/><br/>I am upset though; that I didn't get to see it in theaters, I'm not sure it even came out here. Also, if any one could tell me where to get the DVD (besides online) that would be great. I have searched and searched for it, but neither my friend nor I can find it.

","People seem fairly strongly divided on this movie. The biggest complaint seems to be that the soldiers don't use enough profanity. But that strikes me as a distraction... like saying we should see portrayals of a person's every bodily function. Is it necessary or even desirable? After all even the most ""realistic"" film is still not reality, but a representation thereof. As for violence, ""Saints and Soldiers"" is definitely not for kids but neither is it the exhibitionist gore found in many war flicks that makes them unwatchable. The weak spot is in the plot which seems unnecessarily melodramatic and fantastic in parts. The role of the English pilot could have been done away with and left plenty of believable action. On the other hand, the story is engaging and suspenseful and the characters (despite, or perhaps because of, the ""no name"" actors) are very strong -- distinct, believable and interesting. Other war films could learn from this as ""Saints and Soldiers"" takes a step in the right direction, back to classics like Twelve O'Clock High or Pork Chop Hill, by being realistic without being simply gross. Some people also complained about the ""Mormon proselytizing."" I'm a practicing Catholic, and I didn't find it a problem. More like a depiction of how a Mormon soldier might have behaved in World War II. After all, one has to put up with movies with plenty of atheist proselytizing, so get over it...."
"brightfamouscucumber","9","1","4","23 September 2005"," Gould, the Cleverly Unlikely Ingénue
","Beginning with a brilliantly plausible depiction of the WWII tragedy known as the Malmedy Massacre during the Battle of the Bulge, Saints and Soldiers portrays the journey of a survivor of that ""Massacre"", Army Medic Stephen Gould (Aexander Niver, best know to me for his role more than a decade ago in Charles in Charge), and his internal struggle to come to terms with the causes of the onslaught, death, and mayhem, which surround him.<br/><br/>Evading death in the meadow at Five-Points Crossroads, Gould escapes captivity, and bands together with four unlikely, but dramatically aesthetic fellow surviving P.O.W. escapee G.I.s.<br/><br/>Gould's first acquaintance, an unnamed and unarmed fellow escapee is mercilessly gunned down by a German solder, whose next target would have been Gould himself, but for the timely courageous act of Corporal Nathan Greer, (Corbin Allred, from the Time Warrior series), who single-handedly saves Gould's life, but then inexplicably lets the German escape as well.<br/><br/>Gould and Greer then join up with Sergeant Gordon Gunderson (Peter Holden), who also owes his life to Corporal Greer, whom he respectfully refers to as ""Deke"" or ""The Deacon"".<br/><br/>While hiding out, armed with a single captured German rifle, these three are joined by the gung-ho, trigger-happy, Kraut-killing Private Shirl Kendrick, who has already made Gould's acquaintance.<br/><br/>This rag-tag band tries to hole up, to await rescue by the advancing Allied Forces, but when an Allied airplane gets shot down not far away, they and venture forth and rescue an airman, trapped in a tree by his own parachute, R.A.F. Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley (Kirby Heybourn, The R.M.), who possesses information crucial to the war which simply must get back to Headquarters.<br/><br/>Armed only with Winley's revolver and Deacon's captured Kraut rifle, these five make an heroic effort to save the battle, by making their way back across enemy lines.<br/><br/>Gould, the incurably bitter realist, secure in knowing that the war's atrocities of war are embodied by those in the other uniform, now behind enemy lines, begins to see the barbarism of warfare from a new perspective as he begins to see that his new comrades consist of: a women- and children-killer, an outwardly gung-ho closet coward, a subtle sadist, a naïve and overly-loyal optimist, and worst of all, a German sympathizer, each of whom is also contributing to the horrors of Gould's personal war, waging against Gould's outlook on life.<br/><br/>Gould makes a cleverly unlikely ingénue whose simplistic understanding of war takes several turns, as he seeks to make sense of new revelations of who are his enemies and who are his allies, who are the cowards and criminals of war, and what courage these cowards and criminals are capable of.<br/><br/>By movie's end, Gould is looking at war, and life, from a whole new perspective.<br/><br/>Something that each of us should do.<br/><br/>Brilliantly, however, the movie ends without Gould declaring any new beliefs of good or evil, it's just clear that everything that Gould started out believing so vehemently is no longer quite so crystal-clear, with a lot of compelling screenplay to justify Gould's conversion to a variety of possible ideals: is there an afterlife? is there redemption? is honor to be found among one's enemies? can cowards become courageous? can anything good come of so much death? is anything worth dying for? and a whole lot more.<br/><br/>Especially clever are the many unlikely but reportedly true war stories from other battles, which have been threaded into Gould's journey. Every ""unbelievable"" part of the movie has been reported by more than one eyewitness to similar real-life events. <br/><br/>Also cleverly incorporated into the story line is how this war story is relatively free of violence and ""foul-language"". <br/><br/>Most compelling of all, is how this movie, made in Utah, by predominantly (but not exclusively) Latter-day Saint artists, have incorporated the aspect of religion so subtly into the story, that although there are several inferences to Mormonism, those same inferences could easily also be drawn on any Christian religion, which, in the truest aspect of Islam, is a perfectly valid example of Islamically acceptable Christianity as well, which is an extremely important in light of today's religion-instigated wars in the Middle East. <br/><br/>Gould, a common Jewish surname, could easily be addressing in Greer: a returned Mormon missionary with a pocket-sized Book of Mormon, or a coffee intolerant traveling Baptist lay-minister with his New Testament and Psalms, or even a reasonably devout Islamic Suni with a pocket-sized portion of the Q'ran. This movie is not about any particular, but could easily be inferring the beliefs of any of a dozen of religions. <br/><br/>Again, Gould does not get to decide if Greer's religion is right, but we see Gould recognizing value in Greer's beliefs. <br/><br/>All in all, this is an extremely well-done movie. <br/><br/>The problem I find in this film is that Corbin Allred and not Alexander Niver, gets first billing. This is Gould's story, after all, not Deacon's. Deacon just gets under Gould's skin the most. But when you consider that the producers must have originally thought that the their audience would turn out to be predominantly Latter-day Saints in Utah, where the movie was made, it is somewhat understandable. <br/><br/>The entire cast was well played. Some of the pyrotechnics were pretty low budget, but, I go to the movies to see a story, not to see special effects. <br/><br/>All in all, this is an excellently made film, entirely deserving of its fourteen best-picture awards."

"philip_vanderveken","8","1","4","9 March 2005"," Despite the small budget this is a very realistic and accurate movie with a good message
","I've always been very interested in movies about WW II, but when they are about the Battle of the Bulge I'm always a bit more interested. You probably ask yourself why? Well, I'm Belgian myself and only few people in Hollywood seem to know anything about Belgium and it's history, landscapes,... Too often you get to see things that are absolute nonsense (see my review on the movie 'Battle of the Bulge' from 1965 and you know exactly what I mean). However, I have to say that this movie, even though it had only a small budget, is very realistic and accurate.<br/><br/>Another thing that I also like about this movie, next to the realism, is the fact that it doesn't automatically depict the Germans as pigs and the Americans as saints. OK, in the beginning of the movie you'll see how the Germans shoot their prisoners (and I'm certainly not saying it never happened), but if you look closer than you'll see that it is a reaction on an incident (they didn't shoot them after they were ordered to do so). An even better example you'll find later in the movie. Then you'll see how a German soldier tries to save the lives of the Americans after they had let him go earlier on, even though they first wanted to shoot him.<br/><br/>But accuracy and a good, touching story don't always save a movie. It needs some good acting and directing as well. Even though I have never heard of the majority of the actors or the director, I must admit that they all did a very nice job. The actors really made me believe they were soldiers in WW II and the director kept the movie interesting by using some fine camera work. Trust me, that's already a big deal for a small budget-movie.<br/><br/>This movie is important to me because it gives a good idea of what happened during this battle and because it shows that there isn't such a big difference between the soldiers from both sides. They all believed in the same God, they all wanted to go back to their family and no-one of them asked to be killed in a snowy forest far away from home. I reward this movie with an 8/10. It's definitely worth a watch, especially if you are interested in WW II like I am."

","I believe that the story told is a great example of what we're missing in movies. . . Faith, sure you've heard people tell their stories about their lives, but most people I have observed generally tend to keep their religions in the back seat and only use them when it's needed. Why can't we be proud of our heritage even if it involves religion, and whether or not those religions include Mormonism, Catholicism, Hindu, or any other world religion for that matter. There are a lot of good people out there, and even good people have to go to war sometimes, but that doesn't mean they have to leave their lives and their religions at home. No, it's not propaganda, it pride. This film demonstrates that aspect of humanity, I commend all of those who put their work into such a fine piece of work."
"mattaca","6","1","4","22 July 2004"," Just saw this movie...
","...and it was fantastic. We went to a pre-screening last night in Salt Lake City where the producer, writer, and director answered questions afterward. I thought the film was very well-handled and definitely has a general audience appeal. Granted, it's hard to compete with big budget war films when you make a movie for just under a million dollars (read: This is not Schindler's List), but I agree with the director when he said it could easily compete with movies in the 15-20 million dollar range.<br/><br/>While I noticed my self critiquing the movie at first and almost looking for signs of amateurity, I soon forgot about that and was drawn into the story and moral dilemmas involved. The cinematography and editing both proved good, and the director proved his abilities quiet handily. While some the scenes do get pretty intense, the main focus here is more the personal effects of war than the number of bodies. Along with perhaps The Other Side of Heaven, definitely the most professional film from any Mormon director to date."

Best of all, the film ended with a nice, subtle moral message--something I wish more filmmakers cared about doing right or doing at all.

I was blown away to find out that they made the film in less than 30 days (in the freezing snow around Sundance) and it was done on a tiny budget. It looks really big and the cinematography looks professional. Its almost hard to believe it is an independent film. I think the director did the cinematography as well and that has got to be hard. It has the best hand-held camera work that I have ever seen in a war film. It adds so much energy to the film and it doesn't make you sick. I'm still amazed and how they were able to have real tanks,planes and all those explosions on their tiny budget, its impossible! You have to see it to understand what I mean. Even if you don't like war films I think this will change your mind. My only criticism for the film was it was too short.

He does a brilliant job of showing that war has many faces, and tattooed across all those faces is regret - regret that they are they, regret they are not at home with loved ones, regret for what they must do and what they have done.<br/><br/>Previous reviewers mention religion, citing this movie sways viewers towards certain belief systems. I did not feel that way at all. Rather, the characters in this film are exposed to such discussion of philosophy to promote acceptance across borders, regardless of uniform. If there's any underlying philosophical message, it's that things happen for a reason, and in war, it is especially important to believe such. It is an attempt to maintain sanity in times of great trauma and hardship.<br/><br/>The production and photography was immersing, the film editing and sound design was masterful, and the acting was brave, elicited by a keen director. I'm no expert on WWII, so I'm sure there were some factual errors made on such a modest budget, but I felt for every one of these characters."

We showed up and saw a wonderful, action packed and heart felt film that left us very happy. Wait! That wasn't the only thing. We realized about half way through that we also got to meet the director, Adam and the main actor, Corbin. What a treat:)! We talked to them for about 30 minutes and had a good time. They are really great people making wonderful films. So down to earth and very approachable. They saw and made the soldiers in their true light by showing what they really go through, not just Hollywood style. War is hard for the soul and all experience it differently. We felt each character had their own story and it drew you into the movie even more. We left the show knowing that a great movie would be coming out and all should see it. <br/><br/>We also went to the Raptors Game on Friday night and guess who was there? Saints and Soldiers!! We got to talk to your wonderful crew again and they gave us posters and a dog tag. What a great experience this has been for me and my family. We appreciate you doing all of the promotional activities because it gets the real audience involved. You now have true followers and we can't wait to see what you come up with next:) Thank you again for the wonderful movie and experience. Mandy"

","his movie is based on real life events, which to me always makes for a better movie. It is a movie set in WWII but it isn't a war movie per say.<br/><br/>It is a story of 5 man, and how they struggle behind enemy lines to survive and bring important information to the Allied forces. Guilt, anger and hate will change into understanding and faith, by not only their actions but the actions of the soldiers who they are fighting against.<br/><br/>A well done movie with an interesting story, worth watching if you are a war movie fan."

","This movie follows 4 soldiers who are present at the Malmedy Massacre but who escape and make their way through enemy controlled territory back to allied lines. I watched this movie because I've read about the Malmedy massacre, and given the title and the fact that Chuck Colson recommended it, I thought it might have a perspective on the atrocity worth my time. Wrong! Intellectually and morally this movie is absolutely weightless and the rewriting of history is offensive. The depiction of what happened at Malmedy is pretty close to what some of the Germans involved claimed happened. Why would the Germans involved tell the truth? Furthermore, the German story is contradicted by the forensic evidence and contradicts the independent eye witness testimony of several survivors. The fact is that many of the men killed were undoubtedly executed--close range, bullet to the head, clustered together. The others were gunned down as they tried to escape, probably once they knew they would die otherwise. Further evidence against the German story is that Malmedy wasn't an isolated event, there were a number of other massacres, some involving civilians, attributed to the same group of German SS soldiers. So why did the movie choose to depict the event based on the German account? Because the truth would have conflicted with the platitudinous main theme of ""we're all the same, we just wear different uniforms"". I am a Christian so of course I believe we are all created in the image of God, but I find this kind of moral equivalence nauseating and intellectually weightless. The other thing that significantly detracts from this movie is that it is extremely predictable. I knew the ultimate fate of every character 1/2 way through the movie and many of these scenes were clichÃ©. I gave it 4 stars because as a movie some of the scenes had their moments, I didn't turn it off, and there are so many other movies out there that are much worse so I have to leave room at the bottom to rate them."

","It's a very small story, but I disagree with those that say it was poorly acted.<br/><br/>And, the artificial snow is fairly effective, better than ""Band of Brothers,"" for example.<br/><br/>My beef with many films, especially films written by relatively young writers, is that they use expressions not in use during the period of time covered by the film.<br/><br/>For example, one of the characters says ""No problem"" instead of ""thank you."" This ""no problem"" thing did not start until the 80s. The same is true for ""Whatever."" I counted at least six, maybe eight, colloquialisms used in the film that no one was using in the 1945.<br/><br/>The story is okay, and the directing is okay, too. Worth a look! 5 out of 10."

","I was privledged to get to see this movie at a Festival in Indy and was amazed at the quality of work this team was able to achieve. It inspires on many levels. The story inspires your heart and makes you want to know more about the men and women involved in these tragic, life shattering events; it inspires your heart to feel all of the pain that was occuring everyday in those dreaded places during that bleek age; and lastly it inspires the soul to want to persue all of it's artistic endevours. This film should be a staple for all future filmakers, as it is a grade A experience and an overall true source of quality through artistic vision."
"Pedrinho","Null","0","2","29 November 2003"," Not a ""Mormon"" film
","I will start with a disclaimer: I am a friend of the director, Ryan Little, and did a some very minor post production work with the movie.<br/><br/>This is not a film where you are going to find Mormon ""doctrine"" or LDS inside jokes, like Brigham City or Singles Ward.  There is talk about God and serving a mission, but it really could be any religion.  In fact none of the characters are from Utah.<br/><br/>This film as great cinematography and very powerful music. There are a lot of good performance.  The best surprise was Kirby Heyborne, from Singles Ward and RM, who does a good dramatic role to brake out of the goofy stuff he has been doing.  I also liked the performance by Larry Bagby because it was real and very natural.<br/><br/>It's a WWII war movie that could be compared to Saving Private Ryan, the Big Red One or any John Wayne movie.  It's a buddy movie.  It's a hero movie. It's not a complicated plot, most of you will figure out the ending but there is enough there to hold you interest for the last hour of the movies. I will say this,  My Mother-in-Law fell asleep during `Master & Commander' but was spellbound through Saints & Soldiers.<br/><br/>It will get a PG-13 because of the shooting, killing, blood and that stuff that goes with war. There is no swearing, no nudity, and no gross violence like ""Private Ryan""<br/><br/>Go see this movie.  It's a nice work of art."

","I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to view this film at the Sacramento Festival of Cinema in October 2003.  The film is a gripping and emotional story with characters that you believe in and care about.  A buddy story in the best sense, and a war environment that has a realism that is hard to capture without the benefit of a huge budget.  These are a bunch of great guys and I expect to see tremendous things from them in the future."
