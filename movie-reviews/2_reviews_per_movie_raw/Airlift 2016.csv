","Over the years Akshay Kumar's choice of selecting the films has certainly improved with significant examples being Holiday, Baby, Special Chabbis, Gabbar Is Back to name few.

From here onward, there is no turning back as the movie gives you nice twist-n-turns with well- choreographed action scenes. Icing on the cake is the climax scenes which has been well executed. On the flip side, length of the movie could have been reduced little further. But brilliant screenplay, Art direction and cinematography is spellbinding.

The soulful number such as 'Soch Na Sake' is already a superhit among the viewers. Besides, other tracks are catching up fast as well.<br/><br/>It is Akshay Kumar's show all the way. A thumbs up to him for doing something different from his usual masala potboilers. After giving back-to-back hits in 2015 with Baby, Gabbar Is Back and Singh Is Bliing, Akshay Kumar is definitely on a roll. With Holiday, Baby and now Airlift, Akshay Kumar has managed to create a image of ""Mera Bharat Mahaan"" actor and fans will love him in new avatar.

"saivenkat02","10","60","74","22 January 2016"," Steals Hearts!
","After Bajrangi Bhaijaan, this one is the next heart stealer! In an industry where good films are not as often coming, movies like these are hugely treasured. Airlift is a real story where humanity is celebrated, and a movie on humanity needs to strike the right chord to enter the audience's hearts. And this one very memorably goes! Akshay Kumar gives his heart and soul to the role and is a huge reason why the movie achieves its heights. The screenplay and direction are top notch, and the music is very hum worthy. And best thing, it felt like it ended early as audiences were wanting more. Seriously Indian cinema standards will take a rise more with this movie. Highly recommended watch!"
"krishnacv","10","58","73","22 January 2016"," Great Movie. Nice start for 2016
","Airlift is simply a great movie whether you talk about direction or acting,its simply mind blowing. Akshay kumar's gritty acting is simply mesmerizing.Unlike other movies , songs of this movie are soothing and full of melody. Its great that they didn't put a item song. The film is based on the real-life conflict and bloodshed that took place twenty five years back in Kuwait, and the way it is done—with a sense of urgency and immediacy, bringing alive a city over-run and under siege—sends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel- producing Bollywood.Other than that Nimrat kaur's was also very good. Overall, 'Airlift' is a good film,solidly plotted, well executed and well- acted. A must watch. Its a perfect movie for Republic Day Week !"
"maulin5","9","74","96","22 January 2016"," Airlift will surely touch all Indians by heart!
","As this year has been started well with Wazir, the good work of Bollywood is on the road with increasing the speed and performance. Yes, I'm talking about Akshay Kumar starer Airlift, directed by Raja Krishna Menon, and which is based on true events! Film starts in Kuwait. Rajiv Katyal (Akki) has been reached on the top level in business with his ability. He refers himself as a Kuwait citizen. But when the government leaves their citizens when Iraq attacks on Kuwait under the order of Saddam Hussain, the people becomes needless. Rajiv now feels that he is an Indian, and so along with other 1,70,000 people who are actually Indians but lives in Kuwait, he starts the mission to run from Kuwait as soon as possible. His tries, his communication to India for the help, and the officer's help from India - These things you can find out in this movie. Some factors, like emotions of love for the family, for the nation, for the coworkers and their relatives, for the people who are only belongs to the same nation, have been described very well. Many moments where we can feel patriotism. Raja has directed a superb film. Akshay has given a stunning performance as usual. I was comparing Baby film with this, but both are different. But if you ask for just one movie, than I'll go with this one. Nimrat Kaur is my favorite since The Lunchbox and Dairy Milk commercials. She has delivered a fine supportive job. She shines as a wife of a rich businessman and a caring mother. Kumud Mishra fits absolutely in the character of a government officer. Poorab Kohli has a small role. Supportive cast are fine, too. De Di and Soch Na Sake are very small songs. Perfectly situated. Tu Bhula Jise is the song to remember. Background score suits to the film. Dialogues are good. Nimrat's 3/4 minuets long conversation with a unsatisfied man of the camp who always complains, is a must! Cinematography is good. Some scenes give are shaky, those could have been shoot better. Editing is fine. Indian flag has been waved by an airport staff of Jordan and Akki is watching that, while Tu Bhula Jise song is playing - the scene has been brought so many whistles and shouts. And than one more, in which Air India plane is taking off, while Akki is watching that and in background Vande Mataram is playing - a truly emotional scene! It will surely gives you goosebumps! Overall, a must watch movie for every Indians, to know the largest human evacuation. Salute to all the real heroes! Jai Hind!"
"divash-rock22","10","56","73","22 January 2016"," Every Indian must watch Airlift for once.2016 starts with bang. Akshay kumar nailed the role....
","Airlift is the best film of Akshay kumar till date. The story is all about a business man in Kuwait(Akshay) thinks that he is also a Kuwaiti. But when Iraq invades Kuwait he realizes that he is an Indian and helped all 170000 Indian. This movie give u goosebumps there is no boring scene in the movie. A perfect movie for Rebublic day. This movie is perfect for classy movie lovers who love this type of patriotic movies. All the star cast of the movie done a fantastic job. This time Akshay will surely get an award for Airlift. ...... Go with yours friends, family and watch AIRLIFT in theaters. U guys surely fell proud to be an Indian after watching this movie."
"nidhi_india","10","26","32","22 January 2016"," Great Movie, must watch.
","What do you say about a movie like Airlift? <br/><br/>THIS IS IT! (Remo Fernandes in Jhalak Dikhla Ja) <br/><br/>One hasn't been to too many First Day Shows in the recent past. But this story was too compelling to pass up. One lugged a child and his friend and the friend's mother. All 4 to a First Day Show. And what a treat! <br/><br/>The background music blends in so subtly you don't even notice it. The rest of the score is soothing, melodious and easy on the ears - not a mean feat for a quasi action film. BUT.. the best part is this - the characters are so beautifully etched. Each one of them - including the ensemble cast. Everyone has a place to fill, and everyone fills that place so well. Full marks to the Casting Director! And the actors, of course.<br/><br/>I have become an Akshay Kumar fan in the recent years. From being Bollywood's favourite Khiladi in more ways than one, this person has matured as an actor. He brings that rare thing to the screen - persona. Nimrat Kaur does justice to her role. I would have liked a lot more layering in the expressions of this rather complex character, but that's just me. Joseph - who grows in stature from that first shot when Akshay Kumar is asking him how much moneys they have, to the end. Purab Kohli as Iqbal.. what can one say? He stands out, really, REALLY stands out, is all. You will have to see his performance to know what I mean. From the man who escorts the hero to a small gathering of friends in a supermarket, to the man who ensures an identity for a woman with an infant, and then looks the hero in the eye as he walks past, this man truly is an equal.<br/><br/>But this was not one man's victory. Nor was it the story of one man. There were so many invisible hands who made this happen. They have been acknowledged in the end, but only in passing. They deserved so much more credit for standing by a man and supporting his battle.<br/><br/>One Lakh Seventy Thousand WOWs for this movie. I can only imagine the scale of that number. A full residential complex with 1000 flats has only 5000 people on average. A full movie hall - maybe 150. A flight - 300? 448 flights. Those are numbers that will remain in our mind for a long, long time. Sad that it took so long for someone to tell such an inspirational story, but that time only makes it more special, as we are in a position to look back and appreciate how that one battle of 1990 changed the course of world history, and continues to do so - 25 years later."

Everyone has given 100% either Nimrat or Purab. Performance by Akshay is at its seventh. A glimpse of every side of him is visible. Most importantly, even the Indian flag can make feel safe (truly patriotic and heart throbbing), after all ""its our nature to call mother when hurt "" . Overall, its a must watch.

"nunapachuau92","5","14","19","3 May 2016"," The Ratings though !!!
","One thing I've found prevalent among Indian cinemas are the ratings.Some of them are absurd to a point where you doubt the authenticity of IMDb as a source for checking the quality of any movie.This movie is one of the good ones but still it does not deserve its rating at all.There is no way it comes close to it.For example consider the latest release like Deadpool or Batman vs Superman.Both are equally excellent in terms of story,cinematography and both possess a line of star studded casts.Yet both of them do not have a rating they deserve because of the fair and right ratings from experts and viewers not from a particular or single place but from all over the world.Looking at this rating,I seriously doubt the entire Indian cinema ratings and would rather skip than waste my time and energy to go through any of the high rated movies and would skip the ones that do not even reach 5.This is my personal opinion but all I'm saying is the fans are not doing anyone any favors by giving outrageous ratings."

"gargaman92","10","11","15","21 January 2016"," Airlift Awesome plot
","A story must to be spread #Airlift is compelling, thanks largely to a sterling performance from Akshay Kumar, who is both suitably weary and suitably level-headed for the part enough to anchor the proceedings. The actor is always fine when reined in, and Menon plays to his strengths and Kumar only snaps once, almost reflexively, into Bollywood hero mode, but he is mostly calm and grown-up and holding on.<br/><br/>It is several steps ahead of Kumar's other recent January releases, Baby (2015) and Special 26 (2013), and deserves all the box-office it can get. The bar has been raised and it's about bloody time.<br/><br/>Watch Airlift because it tells a very important story that never got a mention in our history books. And also because the attempt to try out such subjects and story lines is applause worthy. Only if there were less songs and an editor who could tighten the length, Airlift would be soaring newer heights."
"jsingh573-23-709604","10","11","15","22 January 2016"," Review
","Airlift is first and foremost a heart-stopping thriller coming all the way from Bollywood. It's the story of a man whose heroism is awakened in the hour of crisis. Some of the most engrossing moments in the deviously- scripted political thriller find Ranjit Katyal making contact with an officer in the Minister Of External officers in the slim of getting help from the Indian government.<br/><br/>All the actors, never known to let down there characters, creates tremendous empathy for there roles, at one point of time struggling to convince an apathetic Indian administration to send help for the stranded Indians in Kuwait. During times of a crisis the humanism of an otherwise self-centred civilization is known to surface effortlessly. Airlift takes us through that journey of the awakened conscience with exhilarating empathy."
"fatfitnessworld","10","11","15","22 January 2016"," An excellent heart touching + thriller package, AIRLIFT is a benchmark for all film industry. Must watch movie.
","This film is crisp, engaging and racy with lots of action and seriousness along. Never does the film lag in pace or substance. A lot of Bollywood films have been made on terrorism, smuggling and anti social elements previously, most of which sank without a trace. But with fame of Holiday & Baby, Akshay takes a completely different approach with Airlift. Talking about the music & characters of the films, then critics are all satisfied with the star casts. Akshay & Nimrat Kaur all are looking suitable to their roles. Plus music of film is also very catchy and nice. That is the reason most of the critics have rated the film 4 out of 5 stars which clearly shows that not only audience but critics are also in support of Airlift. Very few analysts or critics have given somewhat mixed reviews for Airlift else everyone else is in favor of the film due to its strong entertainment quotient and high public craze."
"muvi-fan-73","8","19","29","22 January 2016"," A good movie 4 an event to remember!
","Airlift is a movie about about how 1 lakh, 70 thousand Indians were safely moved out of war torn Kuwait in Year 1990. It is shown that one man named Ranjit Katyal (fictional character) was mainly responsible for safety of all this Indians in Kuwait. Ranjit could have fled to safety all alone but chooses to save life of other Indians First.<br/><br/>Pros: It's a biography of an event which has its name even in Guiness book of world records, people must know about it, so a movie.. plus point there. One man centered story gives us a hero to praise for. Quality of a worthy leader is well portrayed.<br/><br/>Cons: Historically inaccurate, but that's fine.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10."
"pushkarpandey","5","15","23","30 January 2016"," The film trivializes the issues. This appears like a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation.
","The following article is based on K.P. Fabian's recent interview (The then Joint secretary of Gulf-division.)<br/><br/>The director did it deliberately to portray the MEA in a poor light. I agree that, the director had the freedom to portray Katyal, but the diplomats in the MEA were not fictional characters. They were real people who did an incredible job. I think fictionalization of characters of the MEA, and deny them the right of credit for their work, is unethical.<br/><br/>A lot of the viewers of the film were born after the incident in Kuwait. They need to be educated on their genuine inheritance and history from the First Gulf War. For example, the Ambassador of India in Kuwait, Kamal Bakshi, was portrayed in a very poor light. In reality, Ambassador Bakshi accommodated hundreds of Indians in the embassy and in several other available buildings. The film trivializes the issues. This appears like a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation.<br/><br/>In a sequence, the film shows Air India pilots also in a demeaning manner. The Air India did a great job during the war. Appears like the filmmaker deliberately dealt with Air India dismissively.<br/><br/>In fact, the evacuation was organized by a Cabinet Subcommittee which was chaired by then External Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral. There was excellent coordination among the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Ministry of External Affairs and Air India. We were careful about the developments and we did not condemn Iraq as we had 1,76,000 Indians in Kuwait and Iraq and Kuwait was under Saddam Hussein. We were under American pressure, but we resisted them and avoided condemning the Iraqi action. Mr. Gujral met James Baker Jr, his American counterpart, and conveyed our point of view. In the middle of that crisis, a major issue erupted when during our trip to the region, I.K. Gujral ""hugged"" Saddam Hussein. The fact is that Gujral did not hug Saddam, instead it was Saddam who hugged Gujral. We were of course reaching out to all sides to get out our people from a very dangerous conflict zone.<br/><br/>We also activated the Non-aligned network involving Yugoslavia, Algeria and other friends of India. Americans were treating Saddam Hussein contemptuously and there was no chance of a compromise between the Americans and the Iraqis.<br/><br/>We organized the evacuation in as best a way as possible. We contacted the associations of various Indian communities in Kuwait so that every community could be represented even at the stage of evacuation. The film portrays Mr. Gujral as extremely reluctant. The director made the film without any idea of how the Ministry of External Affairs works.<br/><br/>During Mr. Gujral's trip to Kuwait, he was informed by the Indian diplomats that he should not step out as there was a big crowd of 3,000 people. But Mr. Gujral got on the bonnet of the car and delivered a speech to the same agitated crowd and within four minutes the crowd started saying ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"". Young people who are watching this film are getting a wrong impression of their history."
"dineshprakash","7","37","68","21 January 2016"," Uplifts Indian cinema standard
","Director Mr. Raja Krishna Menon work is superb. You feel yourself in to the screen. Story is inspired by real incident. It is OK. Screenplay makes its interesting by adding so many good and balanced plot, like introducing Kuwaiti girl and its culmination, one scene of secretary with his father, telling him about pain of migration, which triggers him to take the matters personally, track of irritating George etc. Credit goes to screenplay writers Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair, Director himself and Rahul Nangia . Dialogues by Ritesh Shah, are real and impactful. Transformation of characters are very good, like a hardcore businessman to an extra emotional human being of main character. Productions design by Mustafa Staionwala needs to be applauded. Film looks so real and then great work by Director of photography, Priya Seth, to capture it perfectly. It could have been brutal but makers kept it very balanced. One scene where lead actor scuffles with Iraqi soldiers is a note above but its culmination again makes it worth clapping. Performance wise Akhshay Kumar is fantabulous. He is just amazing in every scene, especially in emotional ones. Nimraut Kaur as Amrita is OK. She had a good scene but it was just OK performance by her. Inaamul Haq as Iraqi Major Khalaf Bin Zayd, is first rate. He had gone deep into character that its hard to believe that he is an Indian. His balanced greed in eyes and accent make his character believable. Kumud Mishra as secretary Sanjeev Kohli is impressive. Purab Kohli as Abraham makes his presence felt. Ajay Arya Singh as Akshay kumar first driver is fine in his brief role. Feryana Wazheir as Kuwaiti girl, Tasneem looks innocent as the requirement of character. There was least scope for music but when it comes gives the much needed relief and boosts the pace. Credit goes to music directors Ankit Tiwari and Amaan Malik."
"scottshak_111","6","6","8","17 February 2016"," A historical achievement enfeebled by poor film-making! Airlift is mediocre. Period.
","Yes, we had a great plot in our baggage. A true story intended to pan out a biopic that could have turned heads, made some noise about the plight of 170000 stuck Indians in a warzone. An immaculate rescue operation that was so colossal that it lodged its name in the Guinness Book of World Records for being one of the largest evacuations of all times.<br/><br/>But what does Menon do with it? He changes facts, people, creates sheer fiction, rules out details, comes with a hand-woven shoddy script to replace the truth, places his own fake characters to enrich melodrama, throws in some songs in there to deliberately connect with the Indian audience, enforces unrealistic patriotism for emphasis, and squeezes in pointless unwanted tantrums to say the least.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: The movie begins by depicting the lavish life of the protagonist whilst noisily pointing out how little Katyal, a big fish in the Kuwait business suburbs, thought of his homeland. He had turned, as suggested by a brayed intentional laugh of his friends, more Kuwaitian than a Kuwaitian himself. These bits again seemed forced rather than appear natural so as to benefit the script.<br/><br/>Chaos depicted by some pathetic CGI bombing, tanks and helicopters raids manifest how little we have progressed in movie making. Third grade young actors chosen here try to scare you with guns and a foreign accent. They fail terribly at it. Their acts were excruciatingly unpromising as they try to kick someone lethargically on the butt, shoot people to nail in absent fear, make advances at young girls, or occasionally stop people for intimidating enquiry. Amidst all the mayhem Akshay Kumar cries which somehow doesn't blend in with the unconvincing setup. Also, when he runs home to not discover his wife and child, whilst looking unperturbed by the snot lazily hanging from his nose (which seemed a very forceful shot by Menon BTW), really squeezed out acting from him, which pretty soon disappeared in its next impending frames. Menon tries to shoehorn drama in there which seemed more enacted to have ever reached a gut-wrenching point.<br/><br/>What was however quite endearing to watch was how the movie unfurls into better horizons from there as the protagonist starts taking effective measures to get the job done. The way the story oscillates with the 'how' is the crux of the flick. It however also tries to milk a character called George, played by Prakash Belawadi, depictive of a head that doesn't work well with the mass. What it failed to cash on was its moniker. The fact that Air India flew over 488 air planes in a war-hit zone was humongous, but it was vaguely mentioned in a daft line by Akshay. True heroics get overshadowed right there.<br/><br/>After watching this you will miss Neeraj Pandey big time, or even hope the likes of Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee or even the newcomer Neeraj Ghaywan to have picked this up. Airlift failed to engage and rivet us. The music couldn't captivate us and there was hardly an adrenaline moment to keep our jaws wide open for long. To say that it even came close to the likes of Argo would be downright foolish.<br/><br/>Alas! the damage has been done. What you have is mediocre served on your platter! What could have turned into something phenomenal ends up being an average Indian mainstream movie. It is quite unfortunate that the Indian mass loves this kind of stuff. I would call it nothing but an average crowd entertainer.<br/><br/>Go with lesser expectations and you might enjoy it."

","Airlift is gripping in its first half and shaky in its second. It starts off with gusto but loses momentum halfway through. As you root for the indomitable spirit of those who survived the horrific war, let's take a moment to think why such well-mounted films fail to create the macabre, suspenseful, race-against-time impact.<br/><br/>Watch Airlift cause it tells a very important story that never got a mention in our history books. And also because the attempt to try out such subjects and story lines is applause worthy<br/><br/>Some stories *should* be told. #Airlift sheds light on the evacuation of Indians in Kuwait after the invasion by Iraq. Narrated BRILLIANTLY. #Airlift is taut, engrossing, leaves a hammer-strong impact. Raja Krishna Menon is a director to watch out for. Deserves brownie points. #Airlift is a must must watch. One of the finest films to come out of the Hindi film industry. Just do not miss this one!"

","he film is well shot, with cinematographer Priya Seth achieving the right mix of impressive aerial shots and cramped hand-held bits, and reasonably well-textured with credible Middle Eastern detailing.<br/><br/>There are hiccups -- like Kumar singing a Hindi song moments after refusing to listen to Hindi songs -- and the songs do indeed get in the way every single time they come on, but things are smoothened over by the solid character artists populating this film, from the surprisingly effective Purab Kohli to the ever-excellent Kumud Mishra to the businessmen who play Kumar's buddies to the fascinatingly helpless Feryna Wazheir, who plays a Kuwaiti woman hoping to make her escape with the Indians.<br/><br/>It isn't all on the up and up, though: Prakash Belawadi, who seems to be in every film now post his star turn in Talvar, plays an infuriatingly pigheaded and badly written character.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Nimrat Kaur, who plays Kumar's wife, seems challenged by the brief of speaking softly with a strain of Punjabi, like a woman from a Pakistani play, while constantly wearing make-up regardless of how harrowed her character is, like a woman from an Indian television show."

","The film is based on the real-life conflict and bloodshed that took place twenty five years back in Kuwait, and the way it is done—with a sense of urgency and immediacy, bringing alive a city over-run and under siege—sends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel- producing Bollywood. That given the backing of an A-list star, anything is possible: well done, Akshay Kumar, for donning the producer-with- conviction hat to create a crackling film. Airlift proves that quality of Indian cinema is getting raised day by day. Akki delivered a fantabulous performance again after baby and special 26. The vandemataram anthem will surely create Goosebumps and will make you stand in the theatre. Raja Krishna menon as a debutant made a landmark. Nimrat Kaur as female lead was more than okay. Comic nuisance created by Prakash belawadi was very good. All over it can be said that the movie of the year is this. Although it will not have any award. Just go and watch the movie. I'm more than satisfied."

","Dear gullible Indian/Foreign audiences, please do not be fooled by the 9.2 rating this film has received on IMDb. Airlift is an extremely overrated film. Critics and audiences seem to have worked themselves into a frenzy over this mediocre film.<br/><br/>Firstly, Raja Menon is a terrible filmmaker. After the scenes with Akshay and wife (Nimrat Kaur) living it up, the film cuts straight to tanks and trucks coming into Kuwait. There is no suspense, no intrigue, nothing. It is astounding that such a chilling instance of one country invading another was portrayed in such an unimaginative way. The film was completely unsuccessful in conveying the horror of the situation.<br/><br/>Secondly, Akshya Kumar's acting is mostly crap. The guy is so damn self conscious. Nimrat Kaur is also quite unremarkable. The actor who played the Iraqi tin pot general overacted way too much. The scenes where he makes an appearance were absolutely awful.<br/><br/>However, there were a few uplifting scenes. Like the one where all the Indian refugees take on the Iraqi soldiers. And the ending which does promote national integration.<br/><br/>The film is also interesting because it does show how Indians react under pressure - lashing out at each other due to class differences. <br/><br/>But it does not deserve a 9.2 rating by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>More like a (4/10).<br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin."

"ggod-98955","10","6","9","23 January 2016"," This film proves that bollywood can make non-commercial mainstream movie
","Usually we expect a bollywood film to be full of commercial elements like power packed dialogues with heavy background music, melodrama and an unnecessary love track and I expected something similar to that in Airlift but no! <br/><br/>Director Raja Menon has done a very deep research on the entire subject and very carefully brings it on the screen. This film only shows us the reality and doesn't get into any other commercial elements like most of other films these days do. Like in that scene where Ibrahim tells Ranjit about his missing half-wedded wife, his eyes tell you everything and he doesn't go on delivering a 2 page dialogue. That's one of the moments where we understand how the director wants to present the movie.<br/><br/>There are a few enjoyable parts like the Mr. George track. There is an item song also in the beginning to lure the masses.<br/><br/>Camera work is excellent and is one of the major highlights in the film. Rest all departments have also done their job very well.<br/><br/>Talking about the performances, it's Akshay Kumar who as usual steals the show. He has not portrayed but lived the character of Ranjit Katyal. He's perfect in each and every scene. He looks superb with the salt-n-pepper beard (He's been in this look for almost 6 months) and that's really a brave decision by any big actor like him since it affects his image. He proves that he isn't obsessed with the factor of looking young and charming(he was looking kind-of old with the long hairstyle in 'Entertainment') <br/><br/>Nimrat Kaur gets less scope compared to what was expected from an actress like her but still she's good. Purab Kohli is effective as Ibrahim. Kumud Mishra(as Kohli) is also good. Rest all junior artists have done their parts well.<br/><br/>I appreciate Akshay Kumar for doing films like this because apparently he's the only actor in bollywood or maybe in the entire country who is trying to bring films like Special 26 and Airlift into the mainstream category.<br/><br/>Conclusion - Bollywood must make more non-commercial movies like this if it really want to be in the Oscar race."

","I really hate it when Bollywood makes a movie based on a true story and completely distorts the facts. And what is going on with all the retarded ratings for Bollywood movies?!! Come on guys, Indian cinema has so much better than what's represented on the top 250 list. An 8.7 for this is absolutely ridiculous. I feel bad for all the non- Indians who trust the rating and go on to watch the movie and swear never to watch a movie from India again.<br/><br/>Firstly, this movie has a lot of similarity to Hotel Rwanda. Especially the first 3/4 of the film. From the chaos happening outside, random killings, soldiers showing up at the place they were hold up, bribing of officials and so on. Although infused with its own original elements too, the movie was shamelessly ripped off.<br/><br/>Secondly, the historicity of the movie. The movie made it look like there was some kind of genocide of Kuwaitees going on outside. While there were about a 1000 civilian deaths throughout the conflict, The depiction of random killings and rapes is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the actual airlift was downplayed by the Hotel Rwanda ripoff bits. Felt that should have been given more attention.<br/><br/>Thirdly, why did they have to use an Indian guy to act as an Iraqi general. WHY."

","It's a really nice movie to watch if you want to know Indian POV for Kuwaiti war and problems they face You might actually like the movie if you are whole hearted tricolored flag lover, that is why I feel it's give 9.7 till this review. Everything was nice in the movie but not Excellent, I expected a sort of more from Akshay Kumar after Baby(Movie). Speaking Numerically I stepped in to expect to give an 8 after interval I thought to give 6 and after the movie I'm giving an 7. The Things that I liked about the movie was obviously acting by Akshay Kumar, because he wasn't loud like his previous movies, Purab Kohl was Midas as Always. Technically the movie felt good, the story concept was good, characterization was average, because there were too many character. The things that I didn't like about the movie was that actresses like Nimrat Kaur and Feryna Wazheir weren't utilized properly, It was the first time I saw Nimrat Kaur on screen after hearing praises about her, but I was let down as she felt as an Rich Punjabi housewife nothing else, Feryna Wazheir's A talented theater actress and her Talent wasn't used properly either. The other thing is TOO MANY MALYALEE CHARACTER representations, even the role of there General felt to be a bit on funny side instead of the serious one. BOTTOM LINE: You should obviously go to see this movie once, but it's not an that type Masterpiece but you'll like if it even though. You'll over like it if you are Pretentious Indian(No Offense)."

","'Airlift' is a movie based on true incidents that occurred in 1990,in Kuwait.<br/><br/>The initial scenes reveal the influence & lavishness of the protagonist,Ranjit Katiyal(played by Akshay Kumar): A businessman who is a negotiator to the core,keeps friendship away from business,enjoys his life & who hates to be called an 'Indian'(brought out quiet early in the movie,in an exchange with his driver) Ranjit is married to Amrita(played by Nimrat Kaur),and has a young daughter.Life takes a turn for the worse,as one of Kuwait's army camps is bombarded.This scene is important,since the army men staying in the place are casual..the same feeling the residents of Kuwait have: Yes,there are differences with Iraq,but nothing will happen(ever?) Ranjit is informed late at night about Iraq's bombing & doesn't want to believe it.He has a tense exchange with Amrita & tries to contact his friends,acquaintances to validate the information.Once its confirmed,all he wants is,to get out of Kuwait with his family,as soon as possible.En route to the Kuwait embassy,some young Iraqi soldiers surround their cars & force the driver out.The driver is killed point blank.It is here that Ranjit starts introspection.Little by little,he realises: His faith in the Kuwait government was unfounded,strength lies in unity,there is pride in being true to your roots,he will not defy the trust of his employess and run away(like the Kuwait gov.) Thus,the movie takes off as a big evacuation story.But it is as much the story of redemption of an individual,one who leaves no stone unturned for his countrymen.Akshay Kumar plays a strong role with aplomb.He shows tremendous growth as an actor.<br/><br/>Supporting cast: One of the high points of the movie,is the strong supporting cast.Amrita,the wife,starts out as a stereotypical 'elite' but evolves well through the movie.After initial hiccups,her respect for her husband grows with every passing day.Most notably brought out in a verbal exchange with George(more on him later) Though Nimrat has few lines,she does her bit well.Next we have Ibrahim(Purab Kohli),a young newly married employee of Ranjit's company.He is resourceful & does his bit to save Tasneem,the 'Kuwaiti girl'(Feryna Wazheir) His days pass with longing for his wife,who has been missing since just a few days after their marriage.Purab Kohli displays good restraint as Ibrahim.The final scenes show his redemption.Feryna looks her part,though her dialogues are minimal.The other pivotal character is Mr. Kohli(Kumud Mishra) who does a fine job as the Joint Secretary.His first appearance brings out the bureaucracy in the Indian embassy.However,he quickly realises that he is an important mediator & a small chat with his father,awakes the Indian in him.He has a good role & I hope to see him more often.George,played superbly by Prakash Belawadi,is an irritable & irritating character who keeps nagging his wife(& almost everyone around) Never smiling,he is a treat to watch as the ever complaining old man.Major Khalaf Bin Zayd is the most visible chief antagonist.Inaamul Haq is superb in his part as a terrifying,yet somewhat friendly villain.His mannerisms & accent are praiseworthy,as he seeks to always have the upper hand in his conversations with Ranjit.Other characters include the typical Indian minister,who is the first to take credit once the evacuation is successful; a hysterical father who vacates his daughter & leaves the 'Indian camp';the endless Iraq soldiers who revel in holding the guns & feeling powerful by looting/firing at people/shops/homes; the bureaucratic guys who always have a reason to 'pass' the job;Ranjit's friends who,led by him,turn 'Indian' from 'Kuwaiti'.<br/><br/>The movie has small doses of humour/dark humour: what Ranjit,the Kuwaiti,rejects as 'Indian',is embraced by the Iraqi men who dance to the tunes of the same song;the ambassador at Baghdad,who mentions Sachin Tendulkar as a 'poor selection' in the cricket team;the Iraqi biscuit;Ranjit duping the Major & so on.<br/><br/>What the director does well,is to show the screenplay as it is.Never does the movie try to bask in the glory of its subject,never does it stop to glorify Ranjit,never does it stop for song & dance,never does it drag,never does it try to manipulate the audience by towing on the 'Indian' line.The hoisting of the flag towards the end serves to take the story forward & doesn't exploit the audience's patriotism.For a Bollywood movie & for its strong subject matter,it is unusually un-dramatic & unusually short(at 125 mins.,this is still a fast paced movie) As a movie lover,I feel happy that actors like Akshay Kumar are willing to be a part of such movies.I feel happy that Bollywood is finally coming of age & not relying on songs & emotional manipulation to get audiences.Such movies need to be embraced as a step forward.<br/><br/>A big thumbs up to Raja Krishna Menon & the team of superb writers.Go watch this one.<br/><br/>Verdict: (A partially generous) 10/10"

","I have no words for this film.. right from the start the movie takes you through different emotions ... in starting it depicts the characteristics of Ranjit (akshay) .. i mean how shrewd businessman he was ... but then .. Iraq invades Kuwait.. and the whole scenario changes.. Ranjit who once was considering himself as Kuwaiti experiences a change in personality ... decides to take every Indian trapped in Kuwait war zone back to India. Talking of acting and direction ... Just one word comes to mind .. Phenomenal.. Akshay only is the man in Bollywood who fits in this role perfectly .. no other star is capable of such a class serious role ... Nimrat too was outstanding throughout the movie .. The scene in which Indian Flag rise up at the airport will surely give Goosebumps to Indian !! Its Correct ..Feel Proud for our country - India ...

Great emotions, feeling like I was there. Quality music, Arijit Singh Sung with his pure heart. Airlift is based on the true incident of India's biggest human evacuation mission during the 1990 Gulf War in which 1.7 lakh Indians were airlifted using 488 flights in just 59 days. Airlift is a tale of heroism, courage, patriotism, and a lot more. And deserves a standing ovation. In all, Airlift is the story of unparalleled courage and unsung heroes. From unknown names in the Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi to people who had their Indianness rearing its head from within just when it was required, Airlift is un-miss-able."

"hamadaljuwaied","1","10","20","29 January 2016"," Making Iraq as the heroes + disregarding the Kuwaiti government + mistakes and bad effort
","I didn't like how this movie made Kuwait as thieves! really ,they stole Iraqi Oil ? is that what the history says? not just because India was a supporter of Iraq, they have to be in their side in the movie as well! truth must be told in the movie.<br/><br/>second thing is that they said that the Kuwaiti government left Kuwait and they didn't care about their people! Sheik Jaber Alsabah made an armed resistance from both military and civilian forces to secure Kuwait's people and Indians were among them.<br/><br/>The last thing was the errors this movie has. They showed a picture of the current prince and crown price of Kuwait instead of those who were there in the invasion. And most of the Iraqi soldiers were having Emirates accent which made really confusing for Arab to get into the story, they could train those actors to speak like Iraqis."
"Sexy-scientist","5","8","16","25 January 2016"," Mediocre...?
","This movie had some very good aspects and some very bad aspects. Nothing was mediocre. All subplots were unrealistic and overdramatic viz. Mr. George subplot, Kuwaiti in the camp subplot, the driver subplot, etc. Cinematography was weak. War zones were very weakly depicted. All wide angle shots of Kuwait city under attack looked animated. All fire, burning vehicles were CGI and looked inauthentic to the limit. Makeup and costumes were good. Nimrat Kaur especially looked gorgeous in the whole movie. But, did Amrita Katyal and other cast supposed to look good? Background score was overpushed. Scenes were tried to be made thriller or melodramatic on the basis of background score even when it is not needed. Acting was overall very good. This was the best acting by Akshay Kumar I've ever seen. After the lunchbox, Nimrat Kaur yet again proved her talent. Screenplay was plain bad, eg. Ranjit Katyal goes to the party just because an item number needs to be inserted. It neither sheds a light on Ranjit-Amrita relationship (as suggested by the preceding scene), nor helps the story to move forward. Stereotypes were used for comic element. Direction was subpar. Between the awesomeness of some departments and utter dismal by the other, the movie as a whole failed to rise above ordinary."

He plays the role of Ranjit Katyal, a Kuwait-based businessman, who lives with his wife Amrita(Nimrat Kaur) and daughter (Abida Hussain). His life turns upside down when Kuwait gets invaded by Iraqi forces. The rest of the movie is about Ranjit's struggle to safely evacuate the Indian Citizens of Kuwait. The highlight of the movie is the screenplay, which has been brilliantly written! An intriguing storyline, crisp editing and a vivid cinematography makes the movie bang for the buck!This movie is perhaps, one of the best in its genre. Akshay delivers a stellar performance. He gets into the flesh of the character and looks completely real. He shines in each and every scene! Nimrat, as Akshay's wife, performs at par with Akshay. Despite being just 2 films old (Peddlers and Lunchbox), she performs like a seasoned actor. Her 'outburst' scene is worth applauding! Purab Kohli has been aptly cast and he doesn't disappoint. Other actors perform equally well! Final Verdict- Just go for it. You won't be disappointed!"

He brings that rare thing to the screen - persona. Nimrat Kaur does justice to her role. I would have liked a lot more layering in the expressions of this rather complex character, but that's just me. Joseph - who grows in stature from that first shot when Akshay Kumar is asking him how much moneys they have, to the end. Purab Kohli as Iqbal.. what can one say? He stands out, really, REALLY stands out, is all. You will have to see his performance to know what I mean.

In Airlift, he plays Ranjit Katyal, the unsung, unknown hero who masterminded the evacuation of thousands of Indians stranded in Kuwait in August 1990 when Saddam Hussain's army decided to take over. Akshay delivers a performance that is subtle and skilled. He weaves his way around the crisis, looking for center to his war-torn conscience-stricken character. When he finds that center, the actor builds a character who uses his negotiating skills as an entrepreneur to rescue innumerable lives from danger. I would say that you should go and watch the film it is extremely good and one of the best movie done by Akshay Kumar. He and Nimrat Kaur (The leading lady) gave the heart pumping performance.

","In an epoch of clichéd film-making, ""AIRLIFT"" is a tight slap to all those commercial movies without content and originality.Films like ""Talvar"" and ""Airlift"" shows that the Bollywood is witnessing an evolution and is clearly at par with the Hollywood.Personally I think ""Airlift"" is India's answer to the Oscar Winner, Ben Affleck starer ""Argo"".Though the film is without an antagonist, its gripping and jaw dropping story line leaves you at the edge of your seat.Though the characters are fictitious the movie gives a clear cut pictures of the agony of the stranded Indian in Kuwait at the time of Iraqi Invasion and the efforts carried out by a set of Indian Kuwaiti and Govt. of India Officials to engender the BIGGEST EVER rescue operation in the history of world.The film is well executed in all aspects. Well done Raja Menon. Thanks a lot for making such a fabulous movie. Akshay Kumar is just amazing as Ranjit Katyal..He just nailed the role..The film will definitely make you feel proud as an Indian.You will leave the theater with a feeling of patriotism.I recommend you that this film is a""MUST WATCH"" . BRAVO!!!Team ""Airlift"""
"aboka-481-578437","10","2","3","8 April 2017"," Hollywood could learn from Bollywood
","First I will state that I am not Indian.<br/><br/>This is the third Bollywood movie I've watched in as many weeks. Every one of them has been leaps and bounds better than the nonsense we are fed by Hollywood. Every aspect of these movies is better, from the writing, the character building, the passionate acting, and the top notch musical scores. All the technical qualities and filmography are first rate as well.<br/><br/>Airlift was no exception. The story was engaging, the characters inspiring, and the acting impeccable. The only slight knock, which is not even a knock in my opinion was that the spectacular multi-million dollar special effects you would expect to see in a Hollywood version of the opening scenes were a bit underwhelming. That said, I would trade these any day for the great story I got from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Bollywood movies seem more in touch with humanity than products from Hollywood. Whereas Hollywood movies often leave you feeling that humanity is failing, movies like Airlift, Dear Zindagi, and others reconnect you with the best part of ourselves and show us that there is hope for us.<br/><br/>I'm becoming a real Bollywood fan. I also love how these films are often spoken partially in Hindi and often more than half in English, so I am able to enjoy the film without spending too much time reading the subtitles.<br/><br/>America, watch this film; you will not be disappointed."

","Finally watched Airlift.... smile emoticon This is Akshay Kumar's best ever.... Raja Menon's Airlift will give you goosebumps with fast paced gritting thrills and excitement. The last 20 minutes tell us, why we should feel proud as an Indian. This is a deftly done film, which slide a little in the second half, but never abandons its mission: to tell the story of unsung heroes. Akshay Kumar leads from the front, but shares space when it is needed: Nimrat Kaur, keeps pace with her co-star ; Inaamulhaq as Saddam's man-in-Kuwait, is suitably menacing, Belawadi (George) as the annoying refugee, Kohli is kohl-eyed and restrained and makes us feel for him, Kumud Mishra as the MoEA Babu, disinterested at first, then taking charge, fits right in. Sometimes, being human comes naturally to cinema. That's the moment we need to salute, celebrate and sanctify such movies so that we get to see more unsung heroes on screen. We didn't know Ranjit Katyal. It's Team Airlift has brought this unclaimed hero out of the rubble of history. For your money and time, Some previous movies of Akshay Kumar makes him, the most watchable star in Bollywood today. See Airlift, you will know why. ‪#‎Airlift‬ ‪#‎ProudIndian‬"
"Prashast_Singh","10","2","3","26 January 2016"," Airlift Review : Excellent gift for all Indians and cinema lovers...
","Movie: Airlift (U/A)<br/><br/>Rating : 4.75/5<br/><br/>It's a true fact that we Indians love our heroes and protectors, who spend their lives for us, and when we see a film related to them, we all like those films and start to have a respect for the makers. Akshay Kumar's patriotic action thriller AIRLIFT too is a film which showcases not just the pride in being Indian, but also that in being a true HUMAN.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar starrer AIRLIFT is based on a true story, which might be the biggest reasons why this film succeeds in connecting with the viewers. Akshay's performance and portrayal of a man struck by patriotism is simply outstanding. If you believe me, let me tell you that when Akshay got emotional on screen, I too had tears in eyes. Nimrat Kaur has a good role and she portrays it well; the role is not like a regular heroine in movies. Other actors do a great job and add flavor and color to the film.<br/><br/>Coming to the music, I hadn't heard it before. I watched it only on the big screen. There aren't much songs, but the ones that are there, make their way to the shelves of music buffs. The background score of the film is good and keeps you involved in. The dialogues oozing patriotism are simply to say, superb. <br/><br/>The technical aspects, as every war film has, are top notch and well executed. The action scenes are well choreographed, executed and filmed, and are quite realistic. The cinematography is brilliantly done with and filming locations are quite adorable. The editing is crisp and the film keeps you hooked till the end. The best thing I liked was the director's way of placing the intermission point. You don't have an idea that it would be an intermission signalling for. But, I meant that I liked every single frame of this film. There was nothing to dislike at all.<br/><br/>Another thing to mention is that AIRLIFT is a film which has a strong appeal not only for those who love their country and realistic movies, but also for the audiences who want to take home something they love in a film. In this film, there's not only one portion to take home: You can take the entire film home. I liked the film so much that I think of adding it to my video library soon after it releases on DVD. Besides, despite of a UA certificate, the film is family friendly and can be watched with the family, and rather, the country.<br/><br/>To sum up, AIRLIFT is the finest film that has come this year, and has all the strength to become a major and notable success. Since I watched the film today on the occasion of Republic Day, as I was willing to, I would love to conclude with following lines: AIRLIFT : ""SUCH A PRECIOUS AND LOVELY GIFT, WILL MAKE THE BAR OF Indian FILMS LIFT"".<br/><br/>Anything else, oh yes, I forgot to say that. JAI HIND."

"simply_ankit","6","10","28","22 January 2016"," Good, not exceptional!
","A movie such as this is supposed to be a nail-biting thriller, which unfortunately Airlift isn't. The movie doesn't offer you much to feel the actual tension that might have existed, the fear of death which people lived everyday, stuck in a war zone. The movie goes on like a monotonous narration of a series of incidents which led to a historic achievement in the form of world's most successful evacuation. The thrill, and the gripping plot behind each of those events is missing. <br/><br/>It's a brave attempt to bring to the world the story of a brave rescue operation, but as I read in one of the comments here, the movie lacks sharpness. It stops just at good when it could have been exceptional."

This has unveiled one of the best evacuation story of India. Nothing much negative about this movie, still direction of the last part could have been much better, as the movie maintained a huge pace in the beginning till the 3/4th of it, but lagged a bit in the last.

","It's very difficult to make a biopic on real events, Sometimes filmmakers are forced to take cinematic liberties inorder to get mass appeal Airlift based on the Iraq invasion in Kuwait in 1990 is perhaps not as accurate in terms of facts yet it's a brilliant movie. It moves you, makes you feel for the characters. The film starts off well and keeps you engaged, right from the start The entire evacuation part is well handled, also the characters of Ranjit Katyal(Akshay Kumar) or any other minor character. The film is handled well by Raja Menon There are few hiccups perhaps like as mentioned at times it's too filmy, although I wont mention the song in the boat as it doesn't really seem like a forced song as people have mentioned, The climax too is superb <br/><br/>Direction is good Music is decent, De Di is the best song rest songs are good too though some could be avoided Camera-work is superb, there have recreated 1990s kuwait in UAE brilliantly<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar excels in his role, the actor is growing with every film He is simply fab Nimrat Kaur is fab too, especially in the scene when she gives an answer to George Prakash Belavadi is fantastic in his role, Amongst others Ninad Kamat seen after a long time is good, rest are all good"
"graviravinder","9","3","6","23 January 2016"," The taut script is the highlight
","It could have been an all-out action movie with all the usual Akshay Kumar moves. But here's a script that describes aided by a background and the story concisely and clearly - - the oil politics, the national politics, the reluctance of the External Affairs Ministry to get involved, the migrant experience, the rich-poor divide even amongst Indian expats. And the story keeps moving, maintaining the tension (even though every Indian knows the outcome). There are some moments of biting humour was well. Akshay Kumar respects this script in a nuanced performance supported by Belawadi, Mishra and Inaamul Haq. As for Director Menon (is he a rookie?), superb job. Some favourite moments have been mentioned by others. But see how Menon handles this 5-second bit. The airlift pilots (from Air- India) briskly walk into the aircraft; the rescued passengers already seated watch them come in. They break into applause by way of thanks. The (volunteer) pilots stop, surprised, and then their faces light up when they realise what the passengers are conveying to them. No words, just applause, all in just 5 seconds. And a lump in my throat."

He's simply the best actor Bollywood industry has right now.<br/><br/>The film has a perfect balance of family emotions, patriotism,fear and courage. Right from the start, it takes control of your heart and unfolds a story that was never known. <br/><br/>The pace of the movie at sometimes feels going down, but that apart Raja Krishna Menon has beautifully created the story along with classic cinematography. Nimrat Kaur, though she doesn't share too much screen, is impressive as well.<br/><br/>A big thumbs up for the movie and the team."

"binducherungath","8","3","6","23 January 2016"," Raja Krishna Menon's Airlift is a tribute to the human spirits which finds path even amidst turbulence, gears up courage in spite of losing everything.
","Airlift, a film by Raja Krishna Menon is based on the largest civilian evacuation operation carried out in the history of mankind during Iraq-Kuwait War. This evacuation has found a space in Guinness Book of World Records. Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2nd August, 1990. Most of the Royal Kuwaiti families fled to Saudi Arabia overnight leaving the country rudderless. Kuwait was home to approximately 1,70,000 Indians. All of them had lost whatever they had, be it their home, money etc. Some of the Indian businessmen formed a group who ensured that the evacuation of these Indians is done successfully. Raja Krishna Menon's Airlift is the story of these evacuation events. In the film, the protagonist Ranjit Katyal's character is developed on the basis of real incidents faced by the group of businessmen who became instrumental in these hugely successful evacuation efforts. It is also mentioned that the real Ranjit Katyal (name changed in the film) is alive and a great businessman in Kuwait. The logistics for Indians to reach Amman were arranged first. Evacuation was carried out during 13th August, 1990 – 11th October, 1990 i.e. for 59 days, with 488 flights (Air India, Indian Airlines and Air Force flights). Raja Krishna Menon's Airlift is a tribute to the human spirits which finds path even amidst turbulence, gears up courage in spite of losing everything.<br/><br/>Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar) is a shrewd businessman, for whom, the profit means everything. He is shown to be effortlessly cracking deals with Sheikhs. He is mostly cynical about India, prefers Arabic songs over Hindi songs and takes pride in calling himself a Kuwaiti. After a success bash for grabbing a big project, the news comes to Ranjit in regard to Iraqi army capturing Kuwait. Frantically trying for help from officials, and realizing that the officials have left the country, he understands that he and his family are also not safe like any other person. Amrita Katyal (Nimrat Kaur) is also particular that Ranjit takes care of her and daughter. On his way to seek help, he sees the kind of violence happening, his driver Nair was shot dead. Kuwaitis were killed mercilessly. He was taken to Iraqi Major Khalaf Bin Zayd (Inaam-ul-haq), who warns him subtly to mind his own business rather being a savior. The transformation of Ranjit is shown in a natural manner. Unknowingly, he turns out to the hope of his employees, and other Indians as well. Ranjit sets up a refugee camp to feed all these Indians. <br/><br/>Refugee camp becomes the witness of so many emotions: be it frustration, disappointments, grief, or even the hope, anxiety. Cast and community issues are also covered. Even amidst crisis, man like George Kutty (Prakash Belawadi) is shown, who has issues with each and every thing, be it cleanliness of washrooms, or claiming his own space etc. Ibrahim Durrani (Purab Kohli), aide to Ranjit Katyal, is an example of man, who keeps working for the cause, in spite of his personal loss, whose wife was missing.<br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon has brilliantly executed the whole set of events, right from the Iraqi attack to brutal massacre of Kuwaitis to the evacuation of 1,70,000 Indians. Research of Raja in regard to the events reflects in this well-crafted film. The one aspect which was not very convincing was that there was only one officer in the Minister of External Affairs- Sanjeev Kohli (Kumud Mishra), who keeps convincing Indian administration to send help for the stranded Indians in Kuwait. But definitely Kumud Mishra stood apart as a great actor in his role. His persistence is commendable.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar has proved over the years that he can effortlessly play such roles. He is so natural in Ranjit's character. It is a delight to watch him. Credit also goes to Raja and his team for shaping up Ranjit's character in a natural manner. He is not projected as a hero, but he is projected as a normal human being, who just thinks of his family, business, and profits, but in the moment of crisis, grows beyond his own self-interest, and turns out to be saviour for 1,70,000 Indians. <br/><br/>Nimrat Kaur was excellent in 'The Lunchbox'. So, definitely, expectations from her were also high. Nimrat did not have much to do in the film. Her potential could have been explored more. <br/><br/>Inaam-ul-haq plays the role of Major Khalaf Bin Zayd very well. Different cast who formed the part of the refugee Indians did play their roles wonderfully.<br/><br/>A few scenes which touched my heart: Sanjeev Kohli's father, who was a partition refugee, shares with him that how painful it was to leave everything behind in Lahore, and what the loss of homeland could mean to an individual. Another scene - Amrita Katyal's confrontation with one of the Indian in the refugee camp George Kutty (Prakash Belawadi). Amrita is generally shown to be not-so- happy with Ranjit's decision to save Indians, but when the irritable George Kutty raised questions, she confronted George Kutty and stood with Ranjit. Of course the scene towards the end of the film, where Indian Flag captures the screen. There are a few other scenes, but not mentioning them here since those are to be watched on screen.<br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon's Airlift is a tribute to the human spirits which finds path even amidst turbulence, gears up courage in spite of losing everything. A must watch film which showcases one of the largest evacuation operation ever carried out in the history of mankind. Grand Salute to all those unsung heroes who were instrumental for this."

A very different genre with such a detailed researched and well performed is nothing less than a gift for REPUBLIC DAY weekend.

His sincere effort will help you to visualized the real incident that happened in the time of GULF WAR. The kind of effort he made in research and later jot down his whole research into a paper in form of a movie is appreciable. His direction will definitely make you realize what the AIRLIFT is all about and why AIRLIFT happened. Starting from the scratch to the end of movie his crystal clear visualization skill is definitely felt about. Hats off Raja.<br/><br/>AKSHAY KUMAR: There is no other actor who can perfectly suite this this character. Out of his comfort zone Akshay accepted the challenge and he delivered his best in the movie. His acting definitely reveals that before screen test and other pre-production works he too did detail research about the incident occurred in the past. His bold appearances, emotional involvement and dialogue delivery was better than the best. He proves at every second that why his name is KHILADI KUMAR.<br/><br/>NIMRAT KAUR: She was absolutely stunning to the amount of role she had to play in this movie. In past she was well appreciated for her role in the movie LUNCH BOX. Her second film in her carrier was nevertheless was far more deserving because she was no less than Akshay in this film. She deserves an applaud.<br/><br/>PURAB KOHLI: Though his character is a kind of supporting role but he delivered the best. For me this was his best movie in his carrier.<br/><br/>There are certain lacking in the film. Unnecessary songs included, climax was too short thus suspense doesn't end well. The film could have been made a little longer to provide best climax.<br/><br/>Finally the film deserves standing ovation in all aspects. Outstanding.."

With a budget of ₹30 crore (US$4.4 million), the film premiered worldwide on 22 January 2016.

","When you say a movie is based on true events, you expect it to be at least 80-90% authentic if not 100%. But with Airlift we get a highly fictionalized & over-dramatic depiction of events based in background of true events where around 1.7 lacs Indian civilians were evacuated from Kuwait during Gulf War. Our main protagonist Ranjit Katiyal (Akshay Kumar) itself is a fictional character who is said to be churned out of 3 real people. The film largely undermines the combined efforts of then Ministry of External Affairs & Air India which played significant role in one of the largest evacuation from war zone. Instead it highlights our protagonist & another fictional bureaucrat as the MVPs. There are some parts where you'll ask yourself, did this really happen!?. Like for instance, when Ranjit fights with a bunch of Iraqi soldiers to protect a Kuwaiti woman & child risking lives of 1.7 lac Indians, & after being beaten those soldiers don't even inform their counterparts or call for back up. The pace of the film is slow & the needless songs drags it further. Akshay Kumar & Nimrat Kaur have acted well &other supporting cast have done a decent job. Eventually it becomes another melodramatic Bollywood film where fiction is sold as a true story to touch the patriotic nerve of Indians right around India's Republic Day."

Ranjit Katyal is undoubtedly his best performance ever. I wonder why does he do movies like Tees Maar Khan and Singh is Bling, when he can make movies like AIRLIFT ,Baby and win our hearts. Nimrat Kaur is equally hot and talented. I am her fan now. She plays her character with such an ease and finesse, that you start wondering if she actually is like her character in real life. I wish she starts doing more movies now. Not just the lead cast, even the supporting cast has done a brilliant job. Special mention to Innamulhaq who has played an Iraqi major and Prakash Belawadi who plays a not-so-common man.<br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon, the director deserves an applause for making such an amazing movie and also for sticking to the reality and not making AIRLIFT a typical bollywood one. I, however was expecting a more impactful climax, but I guess for that the director had to move a bit from reality which would have diluted the essence of the movie. So, I won't complain about it.<br/><br/>The background music, the songs (Soch na sake) , the screenplay everything is perfect.<br/><br/>This movie has to be in your MUST WATCH list.

","Akshay Kumar in his finest role in the last decade after Rustom. His role of Ranjit Katyal from being an arrogant businessman who hates and diminishes India and Indians since he calls himself a Kuwaiti resident learns the value of motherland.<br/><br/>Since the entire movie is riding on Akshay Kumar's shoulders so his character was particularly strong one, from being a businessman to a humiliated person to a refugee leader who constantly communicates with Indian government and devices plans to stranded refugees and leads the people after long hardships from Kuwait to Jordan where Indian government and Jordanian government made preparation to extract refugees with Air India.<br/><br/>Second most strong character was of Major Khalaf bin Zayd portrayed by Inaamulhaq was just amazing. He was believable as an Iraqi major who would mortify Ranjit Katyal every chance he got including taking bribes from him so the Iraqi soldiers would not harm Indian refugees. They were at par with each other respective roles.<br/><br/>There were many other characters like Amrita Katyal portrayed by Nimrat Kaur, Amrit Pal portrayed by Avatar Gill, Tasneem portrayed by Feryna Wazheir, Ibrahim Durrani portrayed by Purab Kohli, George Kutty portrayed by Prakash Belawadi respectively. Also Pawan Chopra as Brij (Indian ambassador in Kuwait) and Kumud Mishra as Sanjeev Kohli, Joint Secretary of MEA. These character weren't given much screen time but their performances were so strong you can neither forget them nor ignore them as lesser characters.<br/><br/>If I say about the cinematography and direction is good. There were few scenes that were nice, like invasion of Iraqi soldiers and firing at houses and architectures, refugees scene where they take shelter in makeshift camp, Iraqi soldiers invading camps for essentials, traveling to Jordan and the last scene where Akshay Kumar's character watches planes take off.<br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon, Priya Seth one of the few female cinematographer of Indian film industry and other people associated with this film did a great job in making a patriotic film that show the pain and suffering of actual people who went through this dark times."

It is the sort of awakening that shakes loose Katyal from his cocooned wealthy life, which he shares with his wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur) and young daughter, forcing him to deal with a series of dangerous situations, and leading to the evacuation of more than a lakh Indians stuck between Saddam Hussain's brutal forces and an alarmingly slow-to-take-heed Indian state. The film is based on the real-life conflict and bloodshed that took place twenty five years back in Kuwait, and the way it is done—with a sense of urgency and immediacy, bringing alive a city over-run and under siege—sends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel-producing Bollywood. That given the backing of an A-list star, anything is possible: well done, Akshay Kumar, for donning the producer-with- conviction hat to create a crackling film. And another pat for the performance. Katyal is made believable because Akshay junks faux heroics for an unshowy heroism, which comes from a place of initial reluctance, seguing into a slow acceptance of the situation, and the gradual taking charge because there is no one else that can do the job. And brings his star power to lift the film, in much the same way Ben Affleck buoyed the Hollywood evacuation tale, 'Argo'. This is a deftly done film, which does slide a little in the second half, but never abandons its mission: to tell a tale. Akshay Kumar leads from the front, but shares space when it is needed: Nimrat Kaur, in her second Hindi film after 'The Lunchbox', keeps pace with her co-star ; Inaamulhaq (so enjoyable in 'Filmistaan'), as Saddam's man-in-Kuwait, is suitably menacing, Belawadi as the annoying refugee really does make you want to slap him, Kohli is kohl-eyed and restrained and makes us feel for him, Mishra as the Dilli babu, disinterested at first, then taking charge, fits right in. Bollywood doesn't do well with basing its films on real-life events because it mostly has no idea how to straddle the line between fact and fiction, which is so crucial to the genre. It overdoes things, and turns them into melodrama and schmaltz. 'Airlift' plays it right, and gives us drama, even if things slow down and turn a trifle repetitious post interval. But overall, 'Airlift' is a good film, solidly plotted, well executed and well-acted. Just lose the songs, and the occasional underlined background music the next time, okay?"
"bobbysing","7","0","0","2 August 2016"," Akshay's films might not be reaching the infamous 100 crore status, but the man is rightly choosing his subjects becoming the new-age Bharat Kumar for the present generation.
","Based on the genuinely lesser-known heroes of the past, AIRLIFT is a completely focused and a sincere effort by director Raja Krishna Menon enlightening the viewers about the time of first Gulf War, when around 1,70,000 Indians left stranded in Kuwait were safely rescued by the efforts made by a few local businessmen of Indian origin, a few government employees and diplomats here in India going out of their way compromising with the set protocol.<br/><br/>The rare and unbelievable kind of incident deserved to be adapted on the silver screen as a must and team AIRLIFT does the given important task pretty well with only a few preventable minuses revealed in the later part of the review, mentioning the merits first.<br/><br/>The film begins with a non-Hindi sequence giving you a feel of where the story is actually based and then the lead character of Akshay gets revealed as a cunning, money-minded businessman with a song ""Dil Cheez Tujhe De Di', reminding you of Khaled's hit track of the early '90s titled DIDI. However, the relief moments get over soon within the opening 10 minutes and the narration straight away comes to its basic shocking plot without wasting any more time as required.<br/><br/>The director, along with his cinematographer (Priya Seth), brilliantly recreates the absurd, life-threatening and hell of a scary scenario on the streets very intelligently (with fine detailing), without going into any hugely grand scale (try to catch the sight of all wrecked shops at the back with boards like of CASIO). As a result one truly feels the fear watching military tanks moving around the houses, heavy guns in the hands of young soldiers and people being shot dead on just hearing a word said in Arabic.<br/><br/>Personally speaking, the well-shot and conceived transformation of life within seconds – without caring about any kind of richness one might have achieved – reminded me of a similar sequence in Yash Chopra's WAQT where the life-changing twist is a result of devastating earthquake and not any foreign attack. The story progression remains convincing and majorly gripping till intermission despite some unrequired songs and the film keeps heading towards an expectedly uplifting climax arousing patriotic feeling among the audience that honestly could have been much more energetic and exciting giving the event a thrilling edge.<br/><br/>Apart from the fact that AIRLIFT largely works due to its rare, unheard-of historical event and its (said to be) authentic portrayal, the other truth remains that the film completely relies on the strong shoulders of Akshay alone and the actor underplays the heroic act well without falling back to the usual Bollywood heroism. Akshay's first-rate performance gets decently supported by Nimrat Kaur, who could have done much better underplaying it too, because at times it does make you feel awkward watching her calmly living in her big house overlooking the gravely dangerous situation in the country they are living in. The supporting cast has some effective portrayals from Purab Kohli, Kumud Mishra, Feryna Wazheir and above all Prakash Belawadi who successfully annoys the viewers too along with Akshay and others on screen.<br/><br/>Coming to the hiccups in AIRLIFT, which unfortunately don't let you rate the film as any classic exemplary attempt making a major breakthrough, firstly it's the usual inclusion of love songs (with another inspired one from a Punjabi hit number 'Soch') coming at a time when there is tension written all over the screen with people dying. Admittedly post the first acceptable party track, the moment a melody begins, you feel like why they are adding songs in such a finely progressing movie based on a serious subject? <br/><br/>The second drawback in the film for me was the casting of Inaamulhaq as the Iraqi general speaking with a funny accent. No doubt Inaamulhaq is a fine actor who tried his best to deliver the expected result in the assigned job. But as I felt, another terrifying face in that particular role could have resulted in much more scary impact in those important sequences with Akshay avoiding all the unintentional comic touches. <br/><br/>As the third and most important hiccup of the film, its climax lacked that expected exaggeration or cinematic tension that should have been there depicting probably the biggest civil evacuation in the world history. The detailing was completely missing as it actually had more than 450 planes airlifting the 1,70,000 people from the region, that took around one to two months as reported. Besides, the emphasis entirely remains on talks and requests made on humanitarian ground, without any kind of exciting cinematic moments bringing the viewer on to the edge of his seat as seen in similar attempts in the west like in ARGO.<br/><br/>Talking about the political involvement and will showcased in the film as per the real life happenings, AIRLIFT actually doesn't make you feel proud for the government or political leaders of those times not taking any instant timely action as desired. On the contrary, it makes you feel proud for those few government employees and concerned officials who in reality made it possible through their personal efforts fighting against all the usual political drama and time-lags.<br/><br/>So keeping in mind the shortcomings, do watch AIRLIFT as a good film inspiring us all to be together as INDIANS irrespective of any caste, colour or region. But don't expect anything as exciting and effective as ARGO, HOTEL RWANDA or SCHINDLER's LIST."

","One of the worlds largest aviation rescue mission till date gets carved in stone through a movie.<br/><br/>It goes back to 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait and 170000 Indians were stranded in Kuwait without job, safety, money or passports. The real life evacuation of these Indians have been conveyed through Ranjit Katiyal (Akshay Kumar) in the movie. <br/><br/>It's a two hour movie and it slowly moves into the plot where an Indian cynical business man slowly turns into a saviour of 170000 Indians. The characters have been established with some being interesting and some annoying, all essential for the story. The chemistry between Akshay and his wife slowly gets unraveled and that was heart warming.<br/><br/>The film relies heavily on Akshay Kumar who had been underplayed well without any heroism. The movie is more of an emotional drama which gives you a sense of satisfaction at the end of the movie more than entertainment. In fact, I saw that the entire theatre stayed till the credits to watch the actual pictures of the rescue mission. This is the actual success than amassing hundreds of crores. The movie also subtly highlighted the forgotten officials when the Minister takes the credit for the entire operation and the bureaucrat just smiles and goes back to work. <br/><br/>Special mention to Akshay, who according to me, is the versatile actor of this era for choosing subjects like Special 26, Baby, Airlift etc. He dares when these do not fetch money or awards. <br/><br/>But hatsoff to all the real heroes who made this happen. 488 trips by Air India for 59 days evacuating 170,000 people is no mean task"
"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","10 June 2016"," Airlift was a decent movie. Very uplifting.
","This Bollywood film follows the story of Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, whom must plan out the biggest evacuation of citizens by a civil airliner in history, when he is force to help, evacuated 170, 000 Indian out of wartime, Kuwait, during the height of the 1990/1991 Persian Gulf War. Without spoiling the movie, too much; while, this rescue operation film is not as good, as 1993's 'Schindler's List' or 2004's 'Hotel Rwanda', or even 2012's 'Argo', it was still a good movie, worth seeing even if it has some highly embroidered and fictionalized accounts of true events. After all, there is way too many films that, often take too much artistic liberties with actual events, making it somewhat offensive and jarring to watch. However, this particular film does not. Yes, it takes a few artistic liberties in the depiction of events, but most of them, actually works to make the depiction, much better. Still, there is somethings, worth noting that would need, so work. First off, the idea that, all of this planning was done, under one man's control. As much as I love, Akshay Kumar's performance as the fictional character of Ranjit Katyal and his character arch, from ruthless, selfish, greedy businessman to extraordinary Good Samarian whom initiative, tenacity and dedication help save the lives of many of his fellow country-men. I think, I would rather have the real-life depiction of entrepreneurs, Mathunny Mathews (also known as Toyota Sunny) & Harbajan Singh Vedi. After all, it's seem too unrealistic for one man to plan out, all this. Another thing, I was wondering, is why this film was call 'Airlift', when the majority of the characters, has nothing to do, with Air India's & Ministry of Civil Aviation, involvement in the evacuating. If anything, this movie should be call something else, as only the last 20 minutes is, about the airlift. Plus, in my opinion, the title gives away, too much of the end. I know, history movies are predictable, but gees, the suspense for this film is kinda ruin, when the title spells it out for you. Anyways, the airlift events, didn't just happen, during one or two days, like the film wants you to think. It was carried out from August 13, 1990 to October 20, 1990. That's a lot period of time, staying in Jordan. Another thing, I was wondering, when watching this film, was, how the whole evacuation plan can happens without the India's government active support. The film makes it, seem like the Ministry of External Affairs was little to no help; when in truth, it's the government that coordinating with the different groups and worked with the governments of Jordan and Iraq in having safe passage for the Indians. Plus, it's the government that work with Saddam Hussein, in making sure, they were protected, until the evaluation were over. For the most part, Indians in Kuwait, were allowed to buy food and continue their lives, as if the war didn't really started. I get that, a lot of things like this was omitted, because the filmmakers wanted added to heighten the dangers, but the idea of them, running out of food is a bit silly. Another thing, the idea that the Embassy in Kuwait & Iraq were no help, because they were evacuated of all staff and officers is not correct. Only non-essential staff and of course families would have been evacuated in real-life. The ambassador and his core team would have stayed on, as they did, based on the ambassador's account of the events. It's funny to see Ambassador, KP Fabian who was Joint Secretary of the Gulf at the time of the Kuwait war, being throws in very different light by this film, by being completely omitted, when in truth, he did a lot to help the Indians come home. Despite that, the war movie directed by Raja Krishna Menon is pretty decent. Still, some of cinematography by Priya Seth, does need some work. During some scenes, it was really hard to figure out, what certain characters were looking at, or what, the viewer was honestly seeing. It was a bit jarring to see some modern UAE (United Arab Emirates) backgrounds, that doesn't look like, it's Middle Eastern building style nor from that 1990 time period. Another thing, a bit off, was the violence. It was surprising, very tame for a war movie. I get that, they didn't have, too much of a budget to pull off, too many effects, since it was limited, but they really made up for the lack of graphic visuals, with well-done acting and somewhat decent Arabic & Hindi dialogue, even if it's a bit heavy-handed on exposition. I like, nearly every character, they show here, but still, they did, make the fictional supporting characters of George Kutty (Prakash Belawadi) a little bit too unlikeable for my taste and Major Khalaf Bin Zayd (Inaamulhaq), too campy to be taken serious as a villain. I just wish, they hired more Arab actors, as extras, as it's somewhat noticeable, that Indian actors, were playing the soldiers & citizens as well. Despite that, the music choice wasn't too off. I kinda like the Bollywood mixed with Arabic music type of a flair by artists Amaal Mallik & Ankit Tiwari. Music like '' Dil Cheez Tujhe Dedi"", ""Soch Na Sake"", ""Tu Bhoola Jise"" & ""Mera Nachan Nu"" were rightly place, in the film, and didn't distracting me from the overall theme of the movie. Overall: While, the movie does have some flaws. The good things about it, surly out weight the bad. Airlift indeed lift the bar, a little higher for Bollywood. As a Non-Indian American, I can't wait to see, what type of film, they would think up, next. Airlift is worth seeing."

","Airlift is a story that deserved to be told. <br/><br/>It is obviously more interesting for all those who were affected by or had anything to do with the mass exodus of Indians from Kuwait following the Iraqi attack. Not sure if today's youth would find it that interesting.<br/><br/>The settings are quite realistic.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar and most of the others barring Nimrat Kaur, did an excellent job. Nimrat Kaur cant act well and her soliloquy in the scene where Akshay is being assaulted by the Iraqi soldier in the desert, was pathetic.<br/><br/>That apart, Airlift is certainly worth watching. Especially when it comes on TV :)"

","This is a magnificent effort by Indian cinema for finding & telling their own ""Schindler's List"" story. But other than a common businessman turning into an unlikely hero by saving thousands of innocent lives in a horrifying war setting, both Steven Spielberg's Oscar winning SCHINDLER'S LIST and Raja Menon's AIRLIFT basically have only one thing in common...the triumph of human spirit; a selfless individual's exemplary initiatives to come forward & rise to the occasion for the greatest cause of all during a very difficult time of war. Ironically both the films inspired by two separate true events and this tells us again that history not only repeat itself through bloody wars & countless human sufferings but also it recalls the very basic core of humanity as long as there are saviors like Oskar Schindler or Mathews & Vedi (inspired the character of Ranjit Katiyal in Airlift). Over the years, Indian cinema has developed a lot particularly in terms of production values and AIRLIFT is another shining example of that. Really liked the way they depicted the 1990s war torn Kuwait & the havoc on the streets demonstrated by Iraqi soldiers. The cast did a really good job in their respective roles and specially for Akshay Kumar, I believe AIRLIFT is going to seals his place in the history of Indian cinema like the way LAGAAN or SARFAROSH did for Amir Khan & SAWDES for SRK."
"ThisIsJammy","9","0","0","22 April 2016"," Masterpiece making leads to a epic film.
","I can vouch you that this film is surely the Indian version of 'Schindler's List'. *Proud me* The best thing about a film is 'The emotion in art'. No other form of art, be it books or paintings can shows the real emotions that films can do. When that art meets 'the best of history' the word 'epic' gets the right meaning and this film is one such epic.<br/><br/>The film follows Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, as he carries out the evacuation of 170,000 Indians based in Kuwait , the Invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's Iraq and believe me, the movie follows NOTHING ELSE than the plot (Pun intended).<br/><br/>Big salute to the director of the film Raja Krishna Menon for keeping the film damn straight from the start. There are no plot twists, there is no sudden unwanted songs and the director only focuses on the emotions in the plot, which indeed makes you love the film. With such directing talent in hand and running time just 125 minutes, my greed for more characters and deep characterization's's has no bounds.<br/><br/>The Bollywood film industry is back to its old ways and with films like Bajirao Mastani, Neerja, Airlift and Fan, my love for the Hindi films has increased."

I loved the movie from core of my heart. Akshay Kumar was the heart and soul of the film. Nimrat Kaur was also Brilliant. & other team stars of the #Airlift was too brilliant. The best scene which gave goosebumps to every true Indian was scene where Indian Flag shown on the screen. Akshay Kumar & the #Airlift team made it a Top Class Movie. The Director Raja Menon Made it very simple & that was the main thing people loved it, they didn't try to add any Extra stuff to make it different. The simplicity of the movie was main point the large number of people watched it & appreciate it. Akshay Kumar is the only Superstar who gave Superhits in all genres. He is the King of Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Romance and Social Movies. He have a Golden heart. he always help the needy persons & never show off. He is down to earth.

","In 1990, when Irag attacked Kuwait, over 1 Lakh Seventy thousand Indians were stranded in Kuwait. The film is based on the evacuation of the Indians during Gulf War in Iraq. The stranded were airlifted by Air India, which is considered one of the biggest evacuation operations in the history. The film majorly deals with the efforts of a Kuwait based Indian businessman who leads the evacuation of the Indians by setting shelter and helping them to cross the borders of Kuwait to take them to Jordan from where they were all airlifted by Air India.<br/><br/>Indeed the story is marvelous which just grip you tight to your seats. Besides, the film remains tremendously well made with a taut direction and sequences that touch you. At least there were 4-5 sequences in the film in which you just feel like applauding. The success of this film owes to the humanity it brings in its story. The film just depicts how a common man can turn into a hero when he saves humanity which gets well reflected in Akshay's character. You don't need to fight or show your valor in a battlefield. Once you think beyond your family to save someone else' life, it's not less heroic. In terms of theme the film is similar to ""Schindler's List."" ""Airlift"" might not find itself in the list of historical landmark of film making like ""Schindler's List"" but the story and Akshay Kumar's and Namrata Kaur's performance does touch you for a while. Though the film might lack the rawness and calibre of ""Schindler's List,"" making the film on such a historical event which has never been seen in the screen is indeed commendable.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 4"

","When I heard about Airlift movie that it is based on true events, I didn't know anything about those incidents. But then I googled & wiki'd about it and after sometimes I came to know that it is world's largest human evacuation performed ever. Since then my curiosity towards this movie has increased. Then I watched theatrical trailer of the movie and I was very much impressed. After watching the film, I was completely overwhelmed and totally it has reached the expectations.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Iraq's Kuwait invasion which happened in August,1990. The movie shows how things changed overnight for all the 1,70,000 Indians settled in Kuwait as well as all other people in Kuwait. <br/><br/>A wealthy and influential Kuwaiti-Indian businessman Mr. Ranjit Katyal is brilliantly played by Akshay Kumar. He has delivered a power- packed performance in it. It is just one man show and he steals the show. No doubt, this man is the most talented star of Bollywood and sadly as I mentioned earlier, he makes only 1-2 good movies per year but rest all are just shitty films. Nimrat kaur has done a excellent job in her role. Looks like she prefers performance oriented roles rather than those fashion or chick flick roles. <br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon, Director of this film, has done an intricate research on this incident and presented it very well on the screen. Screenplay has little resemblance with the movie 'Hotel Rwanda"", the way Akshay Kumar handles it to save all the Indians by arranging a camp in a school. But no one bothers about it, this film has its own identity because this is also a true story. There are many others that this movie will offer.. cinematography, background score, music -- all are really praiseworthy.<br/><br/>It is truly a must-watch for everyone. Basically making a big budget film with some senseless story & scenes will be become a boring film only, but making a compelling film like this can win awards. Indian film industry takes a step forward to educate or enlighten the people(like me ;) ) by making films on true events like this. Take a bow Team!.

","Airlift:<br/><br/>Hindi film industry regularly doles out movies targeting NRI's, who form a significant audience both in terms of numbers and collections. For the top actors, it has been a major strategy to target such scripts which appeal to the NRI's while the desi audience got to enjoy the foreign locales and imagine themselves driving swanky cars and partying in high rises. What the industry used to shy away were Original stories and Adapted screenplay as it required a professional approach in direction and a mature audience to appreciate and pay for the efforts. Recent years has sprang up a surprising number of movies inspired by real situations, be it from sports (Milkha, Paan singh), Crime ( Talwar, Charles) or even inspirational people (Maanjhi). However, they didn't target the aforementioned NRI audience. <br/><br/>The makers of Airlift choose a rare heroic incident to appeal equally to the desi and swadesi audience. The incident itself revealing the story of world's largest civilian evacuation led by a businessman in Kuwait during Iraq's surprise overnight military onslaught, could have killed the audience's curiosity, promotions ensuring everyone knew the story. It left the director / writer to lift the movie only through screenplay and good acting. The success of the film is exactly in that, and also in casting.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar, after years of experience in myriad low IQ comedies has started exploring his potential with Neeraj Pandey movies, giving the audience hope of a genuine act. As the suavé industrialist, he has us convinced that he is a Kuwaiti, accidentally born as an Indian within a few minutes. Nimrat Kaur as the pretty punjabi wife refuses to be confined to sidelines with her natural expressions while packing a punch in her dialogues. Purab Kohli in a wonderfully understated key role adapts really well and hold his own, in front of Akshay. The winning role however is that of Prakash Belawadi as George Kutty, the quintessential middle class Mallu, whom everyone in the audience could relate to so easily. His acts of questioning the leader without ever volunteering for it, complaining without ever acting on it, quoting rules which he'd easily toss out when convenient and asking for justice when he feels he has received a raw deal, have a lot of resonance with most of us who would instinctively mouth 'Kya item hai?' while watching his performance and behave exactly in the same way if confounded with his situation. If his wasn't the best supporting role, i don't know what would be.<br/><br/>Apart from the cast, the screenplay ensures many moments which tug the audience's heartstrings including the raising of Indian flag in a foreign airport, with the BGM. The horror of invasion and the desperateness one feels during violation of human rights is presented without going overboard. The humané instincts of feeling safer in a group and being patriotic when it serves us is also brought up subtly. While snubbing the Indian External Affairs ministry, first for inaction and then for taking up the credit, the efforts by the Joint secretary (real wheels of government) are well appreciated and so are the Air India pilots for flying into a warzone for evacuations. <br/><br/>I'd recommend Airlift for all those who are residing out of India and also those in India who know someone out there. Oh, and do watch in theatres, at least the good movies deserve our spends."

","To be honest Hindi patriotic films have never hit the right notes of my nationalistic sensibilities. With dollops of jingoism and nation-bashing there's not much meat to stimulate one's senses barring few like (in last few years) Rang De Basanti or a Swades: We the People (though that was filled with utopia). Last year's ‪Baby‬ was sleek but predictably linear. And then we have Airlift.<br/><br/>Can't believe I watched a film with patriotic undertone which actually didn't play to the gallery. The film might have taken liberties from true events but have depicted things realistically. The plight of the 170000 Indians stranded as refuges in Saddam Hussain's Iraq invaded Kuwait could be felt thanks to Raja Krishna Menon's dexterous execution. The film could easily have swayed to tear-jerking melodrama but Menon's deft handling complimented by some razor sharp writing (Menon himself, Ritesh Shah & Sureah nair) prevented the same. The characterizations and their transitions gelled well with the situations.<br/><br/>Technically the film does proved the we are not far behind the west in terms of depicting war-torn cities and Priya Seth gets away with all the brownie points for her cinematography. In a single frame she craft-fully depicted the plight of whole Kuwait city just at the dawn after the dreadful night when Saddam's men attacked it unwarranted. Seth got able support from Hemanti Sarkar whose editing made the film crisp though they could have easily done away with two unnecessary songs in the 2nd half.<br/><br/>Vicky Sidana demands attention for his immaculate casting. Inaamulhaq (who won our heart in Filmistaan) perfectly depicted a ghoulish Iraqi general. Always reliable Kumud Mishra's commendable performance as the helpful government official will become memorable for sure while Purab Kohli touches your heart as Ibrahim looking for his love. Prakash Belawadi's complaining Joseph act becomes repetitive but he hold on to the character till the end. Nimrat Kaur scores another century after The Lunchbox. I particularly liked the scene where she (as Ranjeet's wife) confronts Joseph accuses Ranjeet of negligence.Feryna Wazhier made her graceful presence felt without any dialogues. And then there's Akshay Kumar who gave a performance of lifetime as Ranjeet Katiyal, a headstrong businessman who believed he to be more of a Kuwaiti than an Indian and his gradual transformation over the course of events. He played the main protagonist but underplays his superstar image thus giving a believable act that showed his growth as an actor. We wish to see more Special 26, Baby, OMG, Airlift in his career.<br/><br/>Having said all the film has its share of flaws as the space was slowing down occasionally in an otherwise taut narrative. Also the scope for some drama had been completely ignored by the makers. The climax is somewhat lame which didn't make the impact needed. May be they wanted to focus more on the incidents that led towards the monumental airlift. Yes, ‪#‎Airlift‬ is indeed a proud historical event which demands respect for all the individuals involved, especially those 488 Air India flights and the two Indians - Manumurthy Matthews and Dr Vedi who were instrumental in getting the balls rolling. As per the film Akshay Kumar's Ranjeet Kaiyal is amalgamation of these two characters. <br/><br/>In the end Airlift is a story of triumph..More than that it is a tale of hope and humanity that breaks all political, societal, religious barriers."

I was born in Kuwait and lived there for the first 7 years of my life and the setting was a bit different from the real Kuwait, but that was in 1990 and I wasn't born at that time. May not be entirely based on the true event but I'm only looking at the event and the result, which is that India evacuates Kuwait and brings all the Indians safe to India, which did happen. Well done movie."

","Excellent idea , excellent acting , excellent direction make this movie the highest IMDb rating movie of Bollywood till date. First to last an awesome thriller. Akshay Kumar again proved his ability.Nimrat Kaur also acted well on her character alongside with Akshay. The songs were perfectly used and were nice to listen. Inaamulhaq also acted well as Major Khalap. After Holiday , Baby , Gabbar is back Akshay again proved that he has born for this kind of films. Mindblowing idea by Raja Krishna Menon for making such kind of film . Few emotional scenes also felt us emotional. KK's Bandemataram as background song when the Indian flag was being hoisted in Jordon Airport touched the heart of every Indian. The cinema can easily claim as a Hollywood film.

","Airlift was really good. It was at 9.7 at one point on IMDb and that's what made me want to watch it. The story was presented very well on the big screen and the acting was terrific. Akshay Kumar carried this movie and he knocked it out of the park. He nailed the callous businessman and the patriotic savior in the same movie and was a lot of fun to watch. Nimrat Kaur also is really good. The characters were written out so well, especially Mr. George. When Iraq invades Kuwait, you can feel the chaos in the city through the emotion on the actors' faces. I was surprised an Indian movie went so dark in some scenes. It really is a mature film. The atmosphere of the city felt just like Gotham in The Dark Knight Rises when Bane attacks. So a really good job with the cinematography. <br/><br/>The only real problem I had with the movie is it got a bit too dramatic at times. The songs were good by themselves, but some of them didn't really need to be in this movie, especially the first item song. Also it ends rather quick and I wanted to see a bit more. It's remarkably short for an Indian movie at only 2 hours and 10 minutes. <br/><br/>Anyway, I really enjoyed Airlift and it is an excellent Bollywood film. It makes me feel proud to be an Indian. From A+ to F, Airlift gets an A."
"SAMTHEBESTEST","7","8","29","22 January 2016"," Ordinary film as a movie lover and above Ordinary as an Indian.
","AIRLIFT REVIEW- Want to clear 1 thing at the start only that although i am Akshay Kumar fan my review will be complete neutral. When we all saw the teaser and trailer we all felt like, yes Akki is coming with another Quality movie, patriotic film is coming, award winning film is coming and bla bla bla. In short we were expecting a Classic means our Expectations were high. So even i Watched it with very high expectations and came out of from Theater with at least satisfied face if not Fully satisfied. As we know it is based on true story so no doubts story will be good and all remains to be seen is how makers present it. Movie starts with beautiful locations as Akshay appears in very casual scene. Everything goes casual for 15 minutes 1 songs pasts which looks average and suddenly main story starts. How Iraq attacked Kuwait and killed all local people along with some Indians based there its all the starting of this story. Content was very sensitive but looks very casual on screens and here Film team fails. How all Indians face circumstances and their desperation to escape from everything keeps you immersed in film and Interval appears. Till Interval it looked ordinary film cause we get nothing special to watch till Interval. All weight of expectations comes to 2nd half which is certainly better than 1st half. Then last 10 minutes are full of Goosebumps but only if you are an Indian. And then some available original stills of true heroes of this evacuation story which left us with Patriotic feeling. Still after movie ends i feel like something was missing. Its not that level movie which i was expecting. Something looked spoiled and messed up. Acting- i am happy to talk about 1 of my favorite Actor that he has given excellent performance here. Not saying its award winning though, it was excellent at its particular level. Nimrat Kaur made me her fan now with this movie. Previously saw her in Lunchbox where she acted well but looked ordinary as heroin. But in this movie she improved as an Actor and looked beautiful as heroin too. Certainly she deserves all appreciation as her expression in frightened scenes and in arrogant scenes were fab. Somewhere it looked like she Overtook Akshay. I don't know the name of that guy who played Iraq Officer's role but whoever he is, he has given very very good performance with beautiful Iraqis accent and dialog delivery. So many actors in supporting roles including them and other star cast all were good. Music- music was good but i personally think all songs looked unnecessary in screenplay. All songs were average to good, not a single bad song in album. Songs are good to listen instead of watching in movie. Screenplay- It is the most important part for films like this and it is strictly good as i didn't find anything special or excellent in it. Still i think runtime could been 10 minutes less as movie looked stretched little bit. Cinematography- film shot at beautiful locations and camera scale look lavish. Some scenes in house could have been better as they shot in dim light. Direction- i don't know much about Raja Menon but as per my info he is not that high level quality director so expecting a masterpiece from him is not fair. He did good job but i expected classic direction which didn't happen. With this story Director has to make a Classic film but he failed little bit not fully. Final Words- Overall a good film and another good film in Akki's career. But my expectations were very high so i didn't find it that much good as it should be made. Don't know why but i expected something like Akshay's last year release Baby and if i compare Airlift with Baby then it is 1 Star lesser than Baby. Baby had tight screenplay and classic direction which Airlift had only Good which is not enough. Last year for Baby i said it is First Quality movie of the but i don't think i can say it for now for Airlift. I mean entire movie cannot be judged on its awesome last 10 minutes of climax. So Go and watch it for Akshay Kumar & Nimrat Kaur's fine performances and its Climax which will give you Goosebumps cause it is inspirational tale for us Indians.. 7/10 stars by me :)"

","Overall movie is average and really looks like a real story with super acting by Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur. But on the basis of entertainment the first half of movie is not more than average.first part of movie was slightly slow. Overall the movie is better than the baby and phantom but not like the other patriotic movies like Rang De Basanti, Swadesh. At the same time they could have made the scene better when Indian Air force airlifted Thousands of people from Oman. The scene when Iraqi army attacked Kuwait was also look ordinary. They could have made serious scenes better An overall engaging watch with a few gritty moments, Airlift does stumble a few times as well. Blame it on the Bollywood audience but the filmmakers couldn't seem to let go of the masala and song-dance paraphernalia that goes with a moolah-raking star in a lead role. An 'Arabic' number is also thrown in for good measure. But in a film that hinges on realism, the songs are jarring."

","Based on a courageous true-story, 'Airlift sadly isn't half as powerful as its story actually is. Director Raja Krishna Menon delivers a sincere tale, but the Writing lacks the sharpness & the urgency a film like this strongly needs. It only appeals in parts, that's it!<br/><br/>'Airlift' Synopsis: Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, carries out a biggest civil operation of evacuation of Indians based in Kuwait during the Iraq-Kuwait war carried out during the reign of Iraqi emperor Saddam Hussein.<br/><br/>'Airlift' is about a man's struggle to protect his people in the middle of a war-zone. But, for some odd reason, there is barely any tension in the film. Raja Krishna Menon, Suresh Nair, Rahul Nangia & Ritesh Shah's Screenplay is a mixed bag. It begins superbly, but 30-minutes into the film, the pace drops. I wasn't tensed or aghast by the way the war erupts nor was I particularly rooting for the Protagonist in his mission. And its the Writing to blame. Also, The first-hour moves on a slow-pace & the story doesn't move forward. The second-hour picks up momentum & fares better in comparison. But overall, 'Airlift' never soars! The Writing needed to be stronger & more urgent.<br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon's Direction is decent. Cinematography is gritty & nicely mounted. Editing is mostly crisp, although the first-hour is slow-paced! Art & Costume Design are average. Action-Sequences are raw & rustic. Background Score is top-class. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Akshay Kumar delivers a committed performance, enacting the heroic protagonist with honesty. Its his performance that acts as a major plus point to this otherwise ordinary film. Nimrat Kaur is okay. Purab Kohli is very good. Kumud Mishra is terrific, as always. Inaamulhaq & Prakash Belawadi ham it up in supporting roles. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Airlift' works in parts. A great opportunity, lost!"

","Akshay Kumar was present for commercial purpose only. Nimrat Kaur doesn't impress as she had done a fine job in one of her previous film ""The Lunch Box"". Inaamulhaq playing Major Khalaf Bin Zayd is a good actor, but he doesn't seem convincing. His character feels like that of a jester. Making it a complete Bollywood film, the songs are an irritating lot. The screenplay was very simple and the character Ranjit played by Akshay had no major conflict as the road is clear for Ranjit at all times. There was no heart pounding moments which was a must for a film on rescue operation in foreign soil. Yes, it is based on a true story, but they do specify about the creative liberties taken, in the beginning of the film, so they could have been more creative without playing with the incident that happened. It is unfortunate that Ben Affleck made Argo. If he didn't, then Airlift would have at least been quite an average Bollywood film. For now, it isn't."

Akshay Kumar has proved himself that he can do any kind of films let it be comedy, action or patriotic. Akshay Kumar as of always a very good actor. Nimrat Kaur was also good at many parts. Top emotions, top songs and top acting by the whole star-cast of the movie. It is based on a reality of the year 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait city and were killing the innocent lives. The movie is short and sweet of 2 hrs and 5 mins and is very enjoyable. The people loved it a lot after the release. The songs are superb with a bit of good music. The first part is based on the invasion of Iraq on the Kuwait city and is short and sweet. People will love it very much. The second part after the intermission is based on the evacuation of 1,50,000 Indians from the invaded Kuwait city by a true patriot Ranjit Katial (Akshay Kumar). The best part of the movie is its simplicity and swift flowing. The climax is great. The song ""Tu Bhoola Jise"" created goosebumps in the whole body when Ranjit realizes the importance of India and Tiranga. What a perfect 26th January entertainer patriotic movie. Hats off Akshay Kumar. You will love the movie do not matter how many times you watch. A superb Action/Emotion/Patriotic thriller of the year. I will give 10/10 for AIRLIFT JAI HIND!!!

"Pramitheus","9","1","2","3 July 2016"," Hope in the darkest hours
","Very few Bollywood movies are as moving and stirring as Airlift. Due to Akshay Kumar movies like this are seeing the light of the day and are getting the publicity which is necessary for these kind of non-commercial movies. I am reducing one star from this movie only because of the songs. Bollywood's love of songs are very harmful to a serious movie, and in this case, a documentary. Real life doesn't have any songs and documentaries should also be treated the same so that we don't snap out of the serious moments in the movies.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much flawless. Akshay Kumar immerses himself completely into the character. Every year he makes one such movie which begs you to ask him personally that why does he make all those mindless comedies which have no cinematic value. If you rate him on the basis of his commercial movies you will definitely rate him a 3/10. Then he comes up with a ""Special 26"" or ""Baby"" and you are completely thrown off-balance. He lets go of all his mannerisms and digs deep and gives such a convincing performance. Actors like Nimrat Kaur, Poorab Kohli or Kumud Mishra are completely in their zone and are almost taken for granted that they are going to do well and they do well.<br/><br/>The direction is flawless. The CGI in the war affected areas are used aptly. Often producers go cheap on small scenes like that and they take you out of the moment because you start searching for the flaws. The director Raja Menon, didn't go for much gore or display of devastation. Instead he trusted his actors to portray the helplessness through their performance. The work of the Indian Government has been both sneered and praised. It is almost like a wake-up call for the Government to do their job by citing an incident which had occurred 26 years ago. It is a wake-up call to humanity in general, showing us that even though evolution has made us smart and technologically advanced but what do we become during times of desperation. This movie shows us that there is hope during the darkest times and also that there is hope for Indian cinema to come out of the trend of commercial movies because the audience is maturing."
"anupviswanath","7","1","2","29 May 2016"," Feels like Hotel Rwanda Script merged into real situation
","Good effort in describing the conditions of people and providing looks and detail into the condition of people during crisis. Even though it depicted real life incident there are cinematic copies you can find if you have watched Hotel Rwanda and similar movies in Hollywood. Akshay Kumar did a good job in maintaining the spirit of movie and there was little role for others especially Nimrat Kaur who is too talented. The movie circles round Iraq invades Kuwait in August, 1990 and shows the inefficiency of system both internally and externally when crisis comes about. The politician shown depicted a guy who wanted to hold on to his throne even when lakhs of people are suffering and when they are saved due to efforts of others he takes the credit for it. This movie shows that there are innumerable number of unknown heroes who worked within to bring all people back to India. The best scenes were Vande Mataram song while Plane lifting off with 1st set of passengers and Akshay's character saying "" I will never ask what my country did for me,after this last flight"". A good effort to showcase historical event but script feels to been scraped from several similar Hollywood movies. Worth the watch"

","It is rare to find a movie on such subjects from Bollywood. I rate it 10 on 10 just on that basis. To top it the plot has been developed well with a lot of characters thrown in to keep the plot interesting. The George and Ibrahim character for example. George is particularly interesting as he displays the typical Indian stereotype who are so fond of picking on others mistakes but will rarely do something on their own. It also shows how there are some very good people in the Indian bureaucracy because of which things still move. I would love to see another movie on the Yemen evacuation. I would recommend this just on the basis on the subject on which this movie has been made."

He goes into the depth of his character and what we get is the best performance of Akshay's career.Nimrat also does her best .The other supporting cast including Purab Kohli does justice to their roles.Raja Menon ,the director, has successfully evolved the human drama in this war- thriller.But there is another plus point which is the songs which are brilliantly written.The cinematography is awesome and same for the VFXs.This is a movie which will be remembered as a classic, for its effort ,especially for AKSHAY KUMAR."
"superindrajit","9","1","2","15 May 2016"," Another meaningful Akshay Kumar movie
","Akshay Kumar is one actor who has significantly matured over his incredibly long movie career. It can be argued that he is still doing mindless potboilers like Singh is Bling (2015) but if you see his growth as an actor, it is incredible. Over the last couple years, he has successfully demonstrated his versatility through films like Oh My God (2012), Special 26 (2013), and Baby (2015). Airlift (2016) is yet another aesthetically significant Akshay Kumar movie after the critical and commercial success of Baby.<br/><br/>Airlift tells the story of a shrewd businessman, Ranjit Katyal, who organized an evacuation in Kuwait. There were several Indians trapped when Sadaam Hussain and his brutally efficient Iraqi Army invaded Kuwait. Katyal goes against all odds and attempts to rescue all these stranded and helpless Indians. He becomes their savior, a ray of hope for many innocents who have given up. Airlift narrates this important journey of how one Kuwait based Indian saved many lives with essential assistance from India.<br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon has done a brilliant job handling the film. As a director, he has ensured that each department has done its job effectively without any jarring components. Most scenes do not drag to the core and there is rarely an over the top moment in this brilliant film. Menon's screenplay is good but there are some minor flaws. For instance, Menon tries to keep the film real without any unwanted action scene. However, at the end, there is a convoluted action scene which can be seen as a snag. However, this does not significantly hamper the film and its message. Ritesh Shah's dialogues are great. In certain scenes, there is some dry humor which works well. In addition, some of the dialogues are clap-worthy. Editing has increasingly crisp which is great but in a few scenarios, it is too crisp. Action in limited doses is good but it prolongs the film a little. Music is fantastic and all songs are properly placed in the film. Soch Na Sake is a beautifully pleasant composition while Dil Cheez Tujhe Dedi is a catchy foot taping song. Main Nachan Tu is a fun song but Tu Bhoola Jise is the best song. In the film, it is bound to make you a little touched. The other technical aspects of the film are good.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar gives one of his best performances ever. He gives a power-packed performance which will definitely be remembered even if some people disagree. The expressions and the body language is fabulous. Nimrat Kaur has a significant role and she impresses. Purab Kohli does not have much to do but he leaves a mark. Inaamullahaq hams it up as the Iraqi major but Prakash Belawadi is good as George Kutty. The rest provide decent support.<br/><br/>On the whole, Airlift is a culturally and aesthetically significant film which will be remembered in future. It will be more remembered for the fact a versatile superstar like Akshay Kumar backed it up and believed in the marvelous content. If Akshay keeps doing such films, it will be fantastic. I'm going to go with a 9/10, it is a must watch."

We saw war thrillers like madras cafe which dealt with it only on political level . airlift deals with it at both political and human level yet never goes filmy or remotely unrealistic. Its a proper docudrama . The journey of akshay in the movie is from a cynical selfish businessman to a man who starts caring for even a Kuwaiti woman. His gradual transformation from murder of his driver to the last flight of air India is touching and inspiring. Nimrat kaur as his wife is excellent and shows how underrated she is in bw. Supporting cast is equally great. Director Menon has proved his worth whether it's story or direction. The way he has covered the human emotions in such a movie is commendable. At the end when Jordan airport staff hoists the Indian flag you get goosebumps that stays with you long after you leave the hall. The end credits nearly made me cry again. It is difficult to believe that ppl like these existed and did what they did. <br/><br/>Airlift at the end is not a film but an experience that everyone must get."
"SivakumarBalachandran","7","1","2","26 January 2016"," Well Executed but faces pace issues
","Airlift is a drama- thriller based on true events during the Gulf war or the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait during August 1990. The film focuses on the evacuation of Indian expatriates stuck in the war zone as homeless. This was the largest evacuation done using civil airlines and it is in the Guinness books. So that is pretty much about the main plot. The story starts initially showing one Indian tycoon Ranjit katyal (Akshay kumar or Akki) who is one of the richest persons in Kuwait those days who loves to refer himself as a Kuwaiti rather an Indian. We even see his psyche from few scenes where he loves listening to Arabic songs, thinks anything fair for profit and dumping his friend and partner. He leads an aristocratic life with his wife Amrita essayed by Nimrat kaur. After the breakout of the war this man turns out to be extra ordinary leaving all his aristocratic nature and becomes a selfless leader who struggles to take all Indians stuck in this situation back home. Then we see how this mission becomes successful. Akki has done justice to his role. Nirmat didn't have much to score except one scene where she talks for her husband otherwise she fits perfect to the role with her make over. We have an ensemble supporting cast who have played their roles perfectly and created an impact with their lesser screen space. Worth mention would be Prakash Belawadi as the annoying person in the camp who always finds fault. Also Feryana as the Kuwaiti survivor looks picture perfect on the role. On the downside of casting The Iraqi major role played by Inaam-ul- Haq was not at all convincing rather it was so false even though he has tried to follow the accent (dis- appointing the team should have afforded a convincing foreign face rather an Indian for this crucial role. Though the film was shot close to reality I wouldn't say it is perfect as it also stumbles on some cinematic and budget constraints in creation of Kuwait. The film's pace is its strength as well as weakness. The pace seems to be perfect in sketching the seriousness of the situation but later towards the climax seems to be rushed up. Naming the film as ""Airlift"" the actual evacuation towards the end flies in ten minutes so which sums up like the struggle Indians faced prior to the airlift was more focused. Also the time reference could have been made clear like at the end of the credits we hear it was 59 days' mission 488 flights but in the main plot we see the prior stage to this probably two weeks of suffering like from 1st of August the day it started.Overall it ends up as an engaging thriller which ends with lots of goose bumps moments."

The best acting was by Inaamullhaq (The Iraqi Major). Akshay as usual was excellent and Nimrat kaur too. A movie cannot be successful if a single actor does any mistake. In this film everyone acted perfectly. Indian Airlines did more then 400 trips to evacuate the entire 1.7 lakh Indian population. Best part was they could even save some kuwaitis in the act. It also showed that we had good relationship with all the Saudi countries including Iraq. Without the permission of Iraq it was impossible for Indians to escape that place.

"dr-sucharitaray","10","1","2","25 January 2016"," Uplifting storytelling about the humanity that lives in all of us
","This was my first movie hall experience for an Akshay Kumar movie. For a long time, I have watched his movies months and maybe years after they have released. As a disinterested Bollywood fan ( largely for the churners that are belted out like the irritating Dilwale, the hypocritical PK and god knows how many KJ productions that Indian audiences are made to go through ) AK has been coming of age.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a huge truth of Indian history, the story trifles the Government of India ( the erstwhile 'unstable' government, as the movie says but the truth was not that, GOI had a huge contribution for the evacuation of those who were trapped...but anyways) and the Civil Aviation ( who apparently were reluctant to go to a warzone initially, without them it would have never been possible ). Neither of these took any credit, and a Kuwaiti Indian origin business tycoon who thought of Kuwait as his motherland till the invasion, is a faceless nameless man till date. <br/><br/>Truths aside, (which will dampen the expectations of the larger audience in India, still expecting AK to give karate chops to ? Saddam Hussein ??? ), the story is a fine attempt to move into reality. I had friends asking for action scenes, but this s real life, where a person can only go so far as a punch or a slap. AK is restrained. He does not do the best acting ( I still think Sangharsh was his best acted out perhaps) but the situations are compelling. And he is refreshingly subdued. <br/><br/>The invasion by Iraqi troops seems outright realistic ( and you are forced to forgive the pseudoiraqi general and AK's Punjabi tinged Arabic) Nimraat Kaur plays the wife that tycoons perhaps have to bear, sophisticated and ill with the largesse until jolted into truth by her husband's about turn. And what a graceful way she does it..<br/><br/>A bit more of the truth about Indian Governemnt and Civil Aviation could have helped. But who knows, maybe the writer hates the last 60 years of Indian Democracy as much as ranjit Katyal and the majority of Indians do. <br/><br/>No wonder the bigger tigers of the Industry are panning the cinema. This is a kind of movie very few people living in our country will rise up for. i do not know if this movie will also win any awards, the technicalities are also a bit loose here and there. <br/><br/>Taking the last line from a previously mentioned comment, and also a big thank you to the pilots of all those aircrafts who flew 1,70,000 people, and a foreign minister of the unstable government who chatted Saddam Hussein in the face of International sanctions. A beautiful tribute to the most beautiful flag in the world. A must know, must see without prejudices.<br/><br/>Jai Hind"

","This is the most beautiful ever made. Inspired by the true events happened in Kuwait in 1990. Iraq attacks Kuwait. How the Indians in Kuwait are saved form the crux of the story. Akshay Kumar has acted exceptionally well. Hats off to him. He also learnt Arabic language for this movie. Nimrat kaur was good. In a scene, where she speaks for husband about a guy who is humiliating her husband was very good. Special mention to director Raja Krishna Menon. Kudos to you sir. Every Indian must watch this movie. Music was good, especially back ground music is very good.All the remaining characters are appropriate. Please watch in it theatres and do not encourage piracy."

","A Joint Secretary to the Government of India is a very senior position in the Indian Civil Service. This guy is a hotshot , who lives in a good accommodation, often a bungalow or a flat in a posh locality, a government vehicle exclusively in his service, his office is a strategically located spacious work station with an antechamber to filter the audience. <br/><br/>I do not know who did the research for this movie. Apparently he did not do his job and presumed that a Joint Secretary level officer is akin to a mid-level clerk in a Municipal Corporation office ( although I must concede , both do the same kind of work). <br/><br/>For a movie that is inspired from true events, it is glaringly unrealistic. The director tries to hard blow the patriotic trumpet but fails miserably. <br/><br/>No actor seems convincing. Some due to the pathetic acting ( Nimrat Kaur ) and some due to the shoddy characters they are given to play ( The Iraqi Military Guy).<br/><br/>The story changes gears abruptly and often without sufficient build up. There are very few scenes that hold the viewer's interest . For most part the film disappoints. There is no grip. <br/><br/>One is compelled to compare movies from the same genre and Airlift is a dud. <br/><br/>Even if one ignores the many factual inaccuracies in the movie , there are some sequences that are plain ridiculous. Like 1,70,000 ( a number repeated infinitely throughout the movies) people travelling in a convoy . Assuming each bus could carry 200 passengers , it would take at least 850 buses to achieve this feat. Just ridiculous. <br/><br/>To add to the viewer's misery the director also tries to fit in elements of the self righteous Indian willing to sacrifice his life to save a Kuwaiti woman and her child. <br/><br/>The movie becomes lamer and lamer with each passing scene . I would say avoid it ."

","Hello all. I've read several reviews on this and everyone is more jingoistic about it rather than being neutral and comment on movie. Tbh a great story is crafted very poorly. It could have been a blockbuster (in true sense) but the cinematography is soooo poor that scenes doesn't go with the flow. Even for the very first time in my life i felt akshay could have done better(sorry but i felt so) and Nimrat spoiled it further. Her acting was immature and i still wonder why was she taken. Songs start at odd times and makes people laugh. So to everyone here giving 9 or 10 stars, a sincere request the ratings shouldn't be affected by ur love towards ur country, stay neutral and rate.

Also,typical Bollywood heroism and emotions are added in the film.As a hard-boiled man George continuously mocks Ranjit over the ongoing mission forces Ranjit and his wife to deliver monologues filled with typical Bollywood heroism and emotions.

","Yes, it is among those movies you have to watch before you die. It is this movie that makes one cry during the last scene. The song Tu Bhoola Jise easily reminds one of his thoughts on leaving India to have a better future. It pricks a needle straight in the heart and the blood gushes out in form of tears. Airlift was the biggest operation of it's kind till date so a big applause to India & it's government. But, it was India's duty to rescue it's refugees. The movie portrays the exact situation of a government office. Today, we made this movie because it was a big thing for us whereas it was the mandatory duty of the government. The hardships made by Ranjit Katiyal with Akshay Kumar's heart-stealing out-of-this-world million-dollar performance make every penny you pay worthy of itself."

Plus to the team for keeping the tension up & not making the script bogged down by too much of melodrama.. It does make me proud to be an Indian , a sure watch..."

","The trailer of Airlift created quite a buzz and made people dig internet to find out exactly happened with the Indians stranded in Kuwait during the Gulf War or the events that preceded them. Little did many know till then, about someone like Ranjeet Katiyal or what he did. And we are talking about pre twitter pre facebook days and to a large extent pre mobile and pre internet days as well. So it does remain a 'Story to be told'.<br/><br/>The movie tries to capture the essence of those events, depicting the efforts made by a rich businessman who decided to stay back, take care and finally arrange safe passage of for the more than 150,000 Indians stuck in the war zone.<br/><br/>Story apart and without going deep into the topic whether the events filmed on celluloid happened exactly the same way, it is needless to say that the movie is a cinematic masterpiece in itself. Brilliantly written script, excellent dialogs and cinematography and in every way a flawless production in showing a war torn country and its people who suddenly belong nowhere. The only weak point I found was the time when the protagonist got into a hand fight with the Iraqi soldiers. It is so unbecoming of a shrewd businessman that he is reputed to be.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar has once again delivered a powerful and believable performance, but the true show stealer has been Ms. Kaur (remember the lonely devoted housewife in 'The Lunchbox'?) with her consistent, effortless, strong yet gentle and graceful performance. Some of the best lines have been bestowed on her, and she delivered them in gold.<br/><br/>It would not be complete without saying that this movie is an apt tribute, just on the eve of the Indian Republic Day, to the unsung heroes of India who have at some point of their lives, dedicated a small part of themselves to the service of their fellowmen, without self and without regret. They rose above the boundaries of religion, language, caste and even borders. And that is the real feat of this movie. Well Done Mr. Menon! 8/10"
"madhurkhanna94","8","1","3","24 January 2016"," Airlift shows you absolute truth but still manages to inspire patriotic feelings
","Airlift is not a very thrilling movie. What it is, is a crisp depiction of true incidents which make you respect the character of Ranjit Katyal in the movie. A successful man, who was righteous and moral at the right time. Nimrat Kaur plays the role of a rich man's wife and aristocratic mother with great conviction. The depiction of the whole scenario is so real, that the realism leaves you gasping. The supporting actors have done a wonderful job with Purab Kohli playing a very likable Ibrahim. The action of India during that time was indeed heroic, but the good part is the movie doesn't actually overdo it, and induces a patriotic feeling in a subtle manner with minimum drama. Overall, AIRLIFT is a must watch one-time watch movie."

","The plot had so much to offer but the makers were not able to capitalize on it. They just narrated how Indians were evacuated from Kuwait when it was invaded by Iraq. Performances, sets and camera work is first grade but the screenplay doesn't hold your attention. You never get tensed about the whole situation, can't remember if there were any edge of the seat moments. The movie was just not as intense as you expect when you go to watch a movie that deals with the backdrop of crisis during a war. <br/><br/>But still I would say it's good effort overall and deserves a watch. It will make you feel good about the country when there is so much negativity going around."
"dubeyandy","8","1","4","24 January 2016"," Airlift is a movie which sets high standards in Bollywood
","Airlift has a lot of imperfections but they don't stop it from being one of the better Indian movies of this time. It is always a delight to watch a Bollywood movie which really does have a screenplay. Airlift is based on a true story of evacuation of 170000 people from Kuwait in 1990. Since, the movie disclaimer clearly states that the plot is inspired by this event but it is not replicating the event precisely, it won't be fair to judge the movie on historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Plot – 5/5<br/><br/>Ranjit Katiyal (Akshay Kumar) is a high-profile industrialist established in Kuwait with his wife (Nimrat Kaur) and daughter and holds a lot of contempt for his motherland India. Disaster strikes as Iraq attacks Kuwait and burns down Kuwait City. Ranjit witnesses the murder of his driver (who was attempting to protect his employer) and transforms into a savior from a selfish tycoon, leading to the biggest air-rescue operation in history.<br/><br/>Casting – 5/5<br/><br/>The movie relies on a lot of supporting characters revolving around Akshay Kumar's character in a lead role. The casting has been done precisely and selected supporting cast expresses synchronization with the plot. Akshay Kumar and Nimrat Kaur blend in well with a large crowd on screen and maintain leading feats. Cinematography & Visual Effects 13/15 There are certain shots which add explicit vigor to the screenplay. Sand dust from cars moving from Kuwait to Jordan and the high-rise shoots of moving vehicles and refugees are definitely very impactive. The shortcomings are seen in close range sweeps where smoother transformations would have made the photography perfect. Visual effects come into picture when Iraq attacks Kuwait and there are multiple explosions. The effects can be identified to be a little unreal and could have been made more graphic.<br/><br/>Sound (Direction, Score, Editing) – 7/10<br/><br/>The songs in the movie are never baseless and always invigorate the passions being conveyed on-screen. Though ""Dil Cheez Tujhe Dedi"" and ""Soch Na Sake"" are not the songs you will hear the whole day but ""Tu Bhoola Jisse"" is definitely the one you will take away as it concludes the movie. The background score is average and could have been better. Beats during transitional phases in the movie, especially in the 2nd half are noticeable. Overall the sound mixing and editing fall short of full throttle, but a good job by Amaal Malik and Ankit Tiwary.<br/><br/>Acting – 12/15<br/><br/>The film revolves around Akshay Kumar who is the very fabric of the screen. At the end of the movie you will not realize how much of Akshay Kumar you have seen and yet be fascinated from his aura. Akshay has delivered his best in Baby, Special 26, Holiday and he does better in Airlift. Nimrat Kaur has done justice to her role, but after a stalwart deliverance in 'Lunchbox' there were high expectations. Nimrat gets a monologue post-interval which could have been better and more intense to be precise. Prakash Belawadi portrays the complex character of George really well. Support from Purab Kohli and Kumud Mishra are refined. Inaamulhaaq playing Major Khalaf wasn't any good apart from his accent. He looked more like a comedian rather than the leader of a deadly troop which invaded Kuwait.<br/><br/>Screenplay – 10/15<br/><br/>The screenplay credit is shared by Raja Menon, Suresh Nair, Ritesh Shah and Rahul Nangia. With works like D-Day and Kahaani the writing has been better than expected. The first 30 minutes of the movie has absolute brilliance. Sheer, crisp brilliance with tactful plot development sets up the movie fantastically. The screenplay is a bit dragged before the interval and could have been curtailed a bit. The second half screenplay focuses more on transit and less on characterization and actors and that's where the movie loses its perfection the most. A few sudden transitions in the movie could have been handled better. There was a fast motion of even-to-event which seemed obvious and didn't end up smooth. Overall, a superb adaptation of a real-life event into a great movie.<br/><br/>Direction – 12/15<br/><br/>Raja Menon didn't have a great hall of fame with his previously directed movies but now he will. Airlift has been a great test of direction and Menon is on top of his game during most of the time in the movie. His best achievement has been depicting the character of Akshay Kumar who conquers the screen by undermining the conventional heroic capabilities he usually delivers. Menon makes the large cast blend well at the right time taking the screenplay forward as and when required.<br/><br/>Production Design – 8/10<br/><br/>The movie is set in 1990 Kuwait and the sets are charismatic enough to bring the viewers into the middle-east visualization. Although, the movie didn't require extraordinary sets, the locations for transits and refugee camps give a good expressive aspect to the movie. The portrayal of Kuwait streets in the aftermath of Iraq attack is very lifelike and needs appreciation.<br/><br/>Editing – 7/10<br/><br/>The editing in the first half couldn't have been better but only till it approaches the interval. Even though, Airlift runs for 2hrs 10mins, it could have been wrapped up in 2hours with the same effect. The long transportation from Kuwait to Jordan could have been cut-short easily. The focus on the final act from Air India and the government was subdued by unnecessary focus on other elements.<br/><br/>True Quotient – 79/100<br/><br/>Why to watch airlift? – Because it has good performances in a good plot. Why not to watch airlift? – Can't think of any reason."

"nairtejas","7","2","15","22 January 2016"," 2016's First Good Film Is Here. ♦ Grade B-
","There is a lot being written and read about Akshay Kumar in the media lately. This film is a standing testament that he deserves that.<br/><br/>India-born Kuwaiti businessman Ranjit (Kumar) finds his whole world turn upside down after he is caught unawares in the middle of cranky Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Already frantic enough to manage his own three-member family's escape to India, Ranjit finds that a mass of Indians, with no one else to turn to, is pulling at his sleeve for help. The story is basically about his, his family's, and his fellow compatriots' struggle to leave the warzone amid rising tension from all sides.<br/><br/>The story is told rather nicely, minimizing the bloodshed but staying realistic at the same time. It's no doubt an extraordinary tale, and the writers manage to make it gripping, and even jaw-dropping at one, maybe two, instances. Of course, the exodus story is too good to be true, but when you KNOW that it is truly based on a real life event and few hearts did beat for almost a quarter million people's rescue mission, you automatically get the idea, and begin to realize the importance of telling such a story.<br/><br/>It talks about one man's painstaking struggle as he reaches astronomical altruism with his bare hands, putting his own life on the warpath. It also talks about India's snail-paced bureaucracy, and how babus are the best benchwarmers in the country. However, a lot of essential minutiae were left out in the screenplay which makes the whole story look too incomprehensible for someone who hates history or who wasn't reading the news in 1990. Lot of questions are left unanswered, which if were at least attempted to answer, could have saved the audience from being in the dark. But still, the photography and production set supports in evincing the sheer madness that presumably engulfed our protagonist. (There is also a sly comment on the intolerance issue currently grappling India if you are attentive.)<br/><br/>The film, unfortunately for enthusiasts like us, looks like it has gone through the Bollywood machine. I say this because you will see random, totally unnecessary songs playing out throughout the film. And Ranjit also shakes a leg in one or two, the only time we get to se his pearl whites. Plus, the attempt at infusing wry humor at certain parts totally messes up with those parts of the flow. Kumar is brilliant as I have mentioned, and is well supported by Kaur and other cast members. Really happy to see Malayalam film star Lena in a role.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Raja Menon's tense war drama, Airlift, is definitely a well-made thriller which will make you feel good about your country this Republic Day, but at the end, the question still creeps in: how much has changed in 25 years?<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

Akshay Kumar is Fantabulous as Ranjit Katyal & Nimraut Kaur as Amrita is OK.As my first full fledged review on IMDb i will go with 7 out of 10 for this movie.A feel Good Patrotic Movie but certainly not extraordinary as ratings suggests."

","What works: Good performances, historically accurate film.<br/><br/>What doesn't: The film fails to capture the horror of the war. Also, the film feels like a documentary. <br/><br/>The first half is quite slow. But the film picks up in the second half leading to an average climax which feels extremely rushed.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a good watch. Akshay kumar has really given an outstanding performance which made the movie better. However it had much greater potential and a great trailer and expectations which it failed to live up to. In my opinion, Airlift works more as a docu-drama and not a thriller. The thrill element that the trailer showed was just missing."
"Abby_qadir","7","1","12","22 January 2016"," Not so high on patriotism but not so less on entertainment.
","Airlift (2016) directed by Raja Krishna Menon starring Akshay Kumar and Nimarat Kaur in the lead is the story of when iraq invades kuwait and how 1,70,000 Indians were rescued in a most heroic way and that was the biggest evacuation in the history of the world.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie I liked is that it doesn't take time to built the story and the detailing of the character because there is no need of it if you are presenting a film which base on true events. You need to be more cautious about the facts and events happened during that time because some of the audience may have already done some research about the event. This film may not be so high on patriotism but it is surely an entertaining ride.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar in the role of Ranjit Katiyal was the best choice and I don't think that any other actor can pull up such a charisma rather than him. He was brilliant in his act and his hard work shows while he act. Nimrat Kaur in the role of Mrs Katiyal was average, I was missing the spark in her, Rest from all the supporting cast I liked Kumud Mishra the most. The direction from Raja krishna Menon was good but it could have been brilliant.<br/><br/>At last I can only say that Airlift is a strong attempt to bring out the most historical evacuation of India in a form of entertainment.<br/><br/>7/10 or 3/5"

","In 1990 Kuwait, Indian businessman Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar) is a fictional character based on the real-life events of Mathunny Mathews. Ranjit is a successful Kuwait-based businessman who is very well-connected in Kuwait and Iraq, and makes a happy home with his wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur) and little daughter Simu. He calls himself a Kuwaiti and is often derisive towards Indians.<br/><br/>After a night of partying, Ranjit is woken up to a phone call from his friend and receives word that negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait have collapsed, and Iraqi troops have begun their advance on Kuwait. Iraq owes a large debt to Kuwait after the Iran-Iraq war and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had urged Kuwait during earlier talks to reduce their oil supply so prices can rise in the market and Iraq can stabilize their economy. When Kuwait refused, and began slant-drilling into Iraqi oil fields, Saddam ordered the attack. That morning, Ranjit discovers that Kuwait is now mostly overrun by Iraqi soldiers. Ranjit and Nair, his driver, go out and drive to the Indian embassy in an attempt to take their family and leave Kuwait. They are eventually stopped by Iraqi soldiers at a checkpoint and Nair is shot dead amidst the confusion. A shocked Ranjit is then taken to the Emir's palace. There he meets Iraqi Republican Guard officer Major Khalaf bin Zayd (Inaamulhaq), who reveals that he was the one who pulled up to the checkpoint earlier and prevented Ranjit from any harm. Major Khalaf, who knows Ranjit from Ranjit's visits to Iraq, chides him but extends his personal friendship, ensuring Ranjit and his family's safety from the soldiers.<br/><br/>From there, Ranjit goes to the Indian embassy where he learns that the Kuwaiti government has fled. The some 170,000 Indians in Kuwait are now stranded as refugees. Iraqi forces continue to push through Kuwait and eventually Ranjit's mansion is broken into, but his wife and child manage to escape to his office. Ranjit convinces his friends to work together, and they set up a makeshift camp for some 500 Indians with Major Khalaf's permission. Amrita urges Ranjit to use his leverage to extricate his own family but Ranjit, who ordinarily would have just looked out for himself, appears to have a change of heart. He decides to stay and help the other Indians get out of Kuwait."

","Airlift follows a man as he attempts to evacuate 170,000 Indians from Kuwait after the Iraqi invade in search of Kuwaitis to kill. <br/><br/>To start, I did not like this movie. At all. Maybe it's because its the first Bollywood movie I've seen and I'm not used to it, but I really just didn't enjoy it. There's this really weird scene at the beginning where the main character starts singing but it's so obvious that he's not. He can't even lip sync it well. And the voice of the singer is heavily auto-tuned, so it's super out of place and fake-looking and sounding. The rest of the music is all super upbeat and way out of place. There's no reason for any of the chosen music to be in the movie. Maybe that's just what Bollywood movies are like, but I don't care. It negatively affected the movie, so I don't see any reason to let it go simply because of the people behind the making of it. <br/><br/>Also this movie advertises itself as an action movie, and yet I recall one action scene towards the end, and its just a crappy fist fight. It was actually one of the worst looking fights I've ever seen. I've seen better fights in other foreign movies that advertise themselves as dramas. Yeah that's right. Movies that consist of almost nothing but talking have more exciting fights than the one in this 'action' movie.<br/><br/>On top of all that, the movie is boring. It moves at a slug's pace, and I really didn't find anything in this movie that could catch my attention. I've seen it all before, and it's extremely predictable. <br/><br/>Overall I really didn't like Airlift. As I was trying to remember what I watched today I couldn't remember this movie. I even forgot to rate it on Netflix when I finished it. I just didn't care at all for it. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie. It's a forgettable waste of 2 hours."

","The film follows Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), a Kuwait-based businessman, as he carries out the evacuation of Indians based in Kuwait during the Invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein's Iraq.<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar as the Indian Oskar Schindler? Sure. The guy has a very believable everyday man charm to pull this off. I love how he is portrayed from the start. Just like Liam Neeson in Schindler's List, he is no hero from the onset. He earns his way to being a hero as the story progresses. Katyal is a male chauvinist and a stubborn patriarch. But sad to say the movie just doesn't engage me in a deeper way. I find it so superficial and the whole story just maps out pre-determined emotional beats that I can see from a mile away. There are lots of missed opportunities here, like the character working in the ministry who steadfastly helps Katyal feels so under-developed. This can't be a heroic story of just one guy. How can it be?"

","When I saw the movie, I didn't have much prior expectations from it due to recent track record of Akshay Kumar, but He wronged me this movie is damn awesome. Ranjit khatiyal can easily be now India's best heroic character for this ongoing decade.His transformation from an arrogant Businessman to a Savior reminded me of Oskar Schindler.This movie is truly a masterpiece for Indian Cinema , though it is not historically accurate but the haunting script, engaging screenplay and a stellar performance by Akshay Kumar and Kumud Mishra cover up for it. Coming to the performances as I earlier mentioned Akshay Kumar is the life of the movie, he carries the movie on his shoulder and it was not surprising as we all know he was supposed to do that. Apart from Akshay, Kumud Mishra is the second best thing in the movie, he underplays his character very well. Nimrat Kaur was as usual very good.In one of the scene where he lashes out a man for berating his husband, is simply wonderful. Purab Kohli didn't get much screen time but plays his part well. What the movie misses, is a strong villainous-character although Inaamulhaq offers some menacing dialogs in the film in so called ""Iraqi accent"" , he was not convincing enough. Direction by R.K men on was good. Final word ""A must watch"" for all Indians."

"alishahmohd","9","0","1","27 March 2016"," A great movie which fantastically portrays the events of Kuwait Invasion
","Airlift is based on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in the year 1990, which resulted in the airlift of over 1 lac Indians, who were trapped in Kuwait because of the invasion. A rescue operation of this magnitude had never taken place before and may never take place again. And this entire movie perfectly portrays these events. <br/><br/>We follow a business Tycoon named Katiyal, who at the start of a movie is a conniving individual, who will go to any lengths to earn a profit, he also thinks of himself in a league of own and does not really care about his subordinates or servants. Things change when the Invasion takes place, and the people start to get killed. Although the Iraqi soldiers were just killing the Kuwaitis, Indians and others were also being killed if their identities were not confirmed. <br/><br/>Kaityal turns over a completely new leaf and now he is not only trying to escape Kuwait himself for the safety of his own family, but he is also trying to save more than 1 lac Indians who are trapped in Kuwait. And this does not just include his employees but other Indians trapped on Kuwait, who Katiyal does not even know. Katiyal goes to great lengths to get these Indians out of Kuwait, failing many times but never giving up hope. Although Katiyal could leave himself with his family, he simply refuses to abandon his people. <br/><br/>Katiyal's character development throughout the movie is a huge high point, and Akshay Kumar plays his role perfectly. The other supporting characters in the movie who get screen time including Katiyal's wife and friends, Iraqi general, also stand out in their performances. the dialogue is also very well written, which leads to many memorable scenes. <br/><br/>However, i do wish they could have explored a little bit more on how Kuwait was before the invasion, and a little more in-depth look into Katiyal's conniving businessman character. This would have made the movie and Katiyal's character development even better. <br/><br/>Airlift is a fantastic, it is not your average Masala flick, but a more realistic movie based on a real life incident, with tremendous performances and acting by the cast, which will not only entertain you, but also inspire you and touch your heart. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10"

"kunalkhandwala","9","0","1","20 February 2016"," Akshay Kumar proves his caliber as a hero that one can relate to
","At the end of each year, audiences have been subjected to a crude and bizarre concoction of preposterous ideas that are formulated in Rohit Shetty's head and somehow, the masses just cannot get enough of it. But silently, as though compensating for such frivolous cinema, there has been one annual film starring Akshay Kumar that has some realism, patriotism, focused storyline and some solid performances. With 'Special 26', 'Holiday', 'Baby' and now with 'Airlift', Akshay Kumar proves his caliber as a hero that one can relate to and not the over-the-top nonsense portrayed in a vast majority of action films these days. Directed by Raja Krishna Menon, Airlift relives the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 that threatened 170,000 Indian residents who left their homeland for better opportunities but were then stuck in a land without much of an identity. Now, it is up to one man to let go of his selfish motives and guarantee the security of his fellow countrymen in trying times as the Iraqi forces become more unpredictable. <br/><br/>A brief intro and a song later, we are directly in the middle of the Iraqi forces storming into Kuwait city. While the locals get brutally executed by Saddam's fanatic army, the sub-continent population faces uncertainty and is constantly threatened even though they may not be identified as Kuwaitis. Realizing that his property, assets and family are at stake all of a sudden, businessman Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar) decides to find a refuge for his company's workers while pleading for protection from a fickle Iraqi General. In no time, the office space is crowded with not just his workers but also their friends and family. With supplies running low, he desperately seeks to arrange for food and shelter for a few thousand and soon enough, the bigger refuge area now camps over 150,000 Indians due to Katyal's tireless efforts. While this arrangement provides some temporary relief, everybody is on the edge because of the anarchy outside their doors. In the absence and negligence of the local government, Katyal reaches out to officials in New Delhi to enable a rescue from the war zone but the bureaucracy and nonchalance from the babus left their fates hanging in the hands of a dangerous regime. There was but one last hope for Ranjit; to lead them all to Amman, Jordan through an arduous journey and uncertainty of border crossings, while an official in New Delhi sought to mobilize alliances and volunteers to aid a rescue operation. <br/><br/>Airlift contains some pretty powerful moments that depict the trauma and stress during the invasion. The intensity of the first encounter between Iraqi soldiers and Ranjit, the traumatic drive through streets filled with military executing Kuwaitis outside their homes, the erratic behavior of Iraqi soldiers as they raid the camp and the border crossing through Iraq were effective in portraying the emotional turmoil of the numerous individuals who faced those dangers. There are light shades of patriotism that don't follow the #nationalism falseness that is rampant in current times. There are moments of heroism defined by one's actions towards a common good, through selfless deeds that make Ranjit's character even more likable. <br/><br/>Akshay Kumar delivers a powerful yet subdued performance, just like he does every year in that one exceptional film. This time however, his acting is much more composed and thoughtful. With a sound understanding of the character and situations, he is able to deliver one of his career best acts. Nimrat Kaur has one stellar scene where she defends her husband's deeds of bravado that get misunderstood by an idiot in their company. The lashing she verbally delivers is far more potent than any other form of rebuttal. Purab Kohli is excellent too in his supporting role as he fights his tragedies in the face of danger that threatens the thousands around him. <br/><br/>Soch na sake is a typical Arijit Singh melody, dil cheez tujhe dedi is of course inspired by Khaled's didi from yesteryear's while tu bhoola jise is deeply inspiring with its patriotic theme and is beautifully sung by Amaal Malik and KK. Raja Krishna Menon has not only achieved box office success for an honest film but also some well deserved acclaim for portraying true events with the right intention of reflecting upon the sacrifices made and hardships faced by thousands of Indians. Ranjit Katyal is a fictionalized version of the true heroes who stood up back then to save several who lost their identities in times of war. He brought them back home in troubled times, thus reflecting a powerful characteristic of human nature and Akshay Kumar, makes it all the more real. <br/><br/><ul><li>9.002 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","As we all know by now that India carried out the Greatest Human Evacuation in History saving more than 170000 Indians with 488 flights in 59 days. An Operation such as this in itself is a Proud moment for Indians no doubt and to justify its recreation on Big Cinema is no less than a Challenge. It not only accepts the challenge but stands out on par with the best of the best Hollywood movies ever made based on true events. I can proudly say that ""Airlift"" is one of the Greatest Movie I have ever seen in Hindi Cinema and it would be in my list of top 10 Movies of All Time.<br/><br/>The scenes directed by Menon in Airlift after Iraq invaded Kuwait are as real as they can get. First 20 minutes are absolutely The Best 20 minutes you will ever see in Indian Cinema. The cinematography is one of the Best; indeed, it changes the whole dimension of Indian audience's perspectives. The movie is visually rich and enchanting, looks as though shot on a very high budget with stunning artistic works on war, invasion and Crisis.<br/><br/>The husband and wife's relation depicted in the beginning of this movie is exactly the same as seen in many usual couples. They love each other but they do argue sarcastically every now and then which is bit irritating for the present audience.<br/><br/>There are so many Excellent scenes in the movie that it becomes difficult to choose one. The creativeness in recreation of invaded Kuwait is purely Genius's work of Art. Salute to him as he made it look like a real event caught on documentary, Unbelievable.<br/><br/>I was never so much inspired by any movie such as this. This is a Landmark movie in Bollwood which should only inspire the creation of many more such movies in coming years.<br/><br/>Nimrat did her job with utmost honesty & sincerity to the character without looking for any credit for her character in the movie. Her argument with Prakash Belawadi was Fantabulous and Spontaneous.<br/><br/>I would definitely applaud Prakash Belawadi as he was kind of smile in between on the saddest and darkest faces. Purab Kohli was brilliant in his short act. It's remarkable that these two guys made an impact in 10-15 Min's of screen time with impeccable their performances.<br/><br/>This is Akshay Kumar's Best Movie ever and his Best Performance in his Entire Career. He has gained huge respect from me doing this movie and I am sure from many other Audiences as well. Henceforth I will always look forth to his upcoming movies as he has turned the tide in his favor by delivering better & better movies every year consistently.<br/><br/>I never remained in a theatre till the end credits roll on, I use to walk away to avoid rush but this time my family and 3 other Indian families in theatre remained till the last credit rolls were up. (last three as I watched this movie in its third week's weekday). The Vande Mataram Chant dispensed electrifying Goosebumps all over the body and they remained till I walked out of theatre. The last song is so beautiful, sentimental and patriotic that you yearn for more even after it stops playing. A huge respect for Akshay Kumar and Raja Menon from me, simply Awesome.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Airlift"" is a Masterpiece, Brilliance & one of a Kind. 5/5"

","this movie is a history,drama,thriller,etc.... must watch this movie ... The film captures the story of the Indians stuck in Kuwait during that time, through the eyes of Ranjit Katiyal and a few other characters. This is a story about how these Indians, with the help of Ranjit Katiyal, managed to survive the Iraqi invasion, andagainst all odds, move across Iraq into Jordan, from where they were brought home to India by the largest ever Airlift attempted in the history of the world. Arriving in Baghdad Katiyal discovers that the Indian Embassy is of no help. The consul explains that they cannot issue passports since many others – Pakistanis and Bangladeshis – use war as a convenient excuse to claim Indian nationality. Kuwaitis in Iraq have also fled. The only remaining option, Iraqi Foreign Minister Aziz is somewhat helpful. He is a friend of Katiyal and is sympathetic to the cause. He discloses that an Indian merchant ship is due to arrive in Iraq and he will tacitly permit the 500 Indians to leave on the ship. But as soon as the buses are loaded and ready to leave Katiyal receives the news that there is a UN embargo and ships are barred from entering or leaving Iraq. One of Katiyal's cantankerous employees rails against him. Amrita comes to his defense and after a loud argument everyone is resolutely supportive of Katiyal. Katiyal continues to keep in touch with the Indian Ministry officer Kohli but Kohli is somewhat of a sluggard. But when his own father recounts their tale of woe during the partition of India, Kohli awakens and begins to actively petition the Minister. The Minister, half in frustration and half in agreement, asks Kohli to handle it. Kohli approaches Air India (then national airline) and orchestrates an evacuation of the 170,000 Indians in Kuwait. Katiyal bluffs and threatens the Major to get him to let them leave. Kohli pleads and wrangles the Indian establishment to get the Amman Embassy to issue permits. When Katiyal finally loads up the Indians and leaves he encounters hostile Iraqi soldiers who stop him at a border checkpoint and threaten to rape Amrita. Katiyal fights them off when he finds the Indian contingent right behind him. The Iraqi soldier drops his weapons and lets them pass. They all arrive in Jordan and the Amman Embassy receives word in the nick of time to let them leave for India. Kohli has successfully negotiated safe passage of all the Indians. Air India supplies the planes and the pilots, previously unwilling to fly over war zones, have had a change of heart towards their brethren. The Indian tricolor is hoisted over the Jordan airport and the film ends as the Indians salute Katiyal as they board the planes that will take them home.<br/><br/>even though the link would help many of you to watch this movie<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD3xnsZ4tYs"

","Bollywood should keep attempting to tell such brave and patriotic stories about our nation, India, by producing more movies like Airlift and such. People are mostly not aware of the nation's glory in the past as well as present. Such movies helps give birth to that feeling of patriotism and love for one's nation which is seen lacking in recent times.<br/><br/>This movie has laid a pathway for a change that is very much needed in the recent trend of movie-making business in India especially Bollywood. Instead of just making and producing movies for the sake of raw entertainment and market profit, movie-makers should realize the importance and impact that a biopic movie like Airlift can have on Indian audience and individuals particularly.I applaud and congratulate each and every person involved in the movie as well as the event that actually took place.

","In 1991 Iraq invaded Kuwait and nearly 175,000 Indians were left high and dry, before being brought to India, in what is regarded as the largest war-time evacuation of its kind. Airlift narrates the story of events leading up to this evacuation. It shows the Indian Government in rather poor light, which is probably exaggerated under cinematic license. Notwithstanding that it is a very credible story, crisply told and tautly executed. It is not easy to narrate events that go back 25 years, and that too featuring a foreign land; this is where the film scores very high. Top marks for the crowd sequences. The stoicism with which most Indians accept their situation is brought out exceedingly well. Another remarkable thing is the film's economy of script; a lot is conveyed through looks and gestures. Though there are many characters, the director does well to keep the limelight on Akshay Kumar, who is intense without being melodramatic. The urgency and emergency that he manages to deliver are very palpable. The film also makes us look at our countrymen laboring in the Gulf with more sympathy.<br/><br/>Finally it is a feel-good film; a film that both Bollywood and the country can be proud of."
"nk13644","10","0","1","29 January 2016"," Airlift movie review: Overall, Akshay Kumar's 'Airlift' is a good film, solidly plotted, well executed and well-acted.
","The film is based on the real-life conflict and bloodshed that took place twenty five years back in Kuwait, and the way it is done—with a sense of urgency and immediacy, bringing alive a city over-run and under siege—sends out a crucial message to star-driven-yet-drivel-producing Bollywood. That given the backing of an A-list star, anything is possible: well done, Akshay Kumar, for donning the producer-with-conviction hat to create a crackling film.<br/><br/>And another pat for the performance. Katyal is made believable because Akshay junks faux heroics for an unshowy heroism, which comes from a place of initial reluctance, seguing into a slow acceptance of the situation, and the gradual taking charge because there is no one else that can do the job. And brings his star power to lift the film, in much the same way Ben Affleck buoyed the Hollywood evacuation tale, 'Argo'."

"jmoneyjohal","10","0","1","22 January 2016"," A patriotic cinematic gem, that has one of Akshay Kumar's best performances till date.
","Airlift is an amazing film and I like to state that in the beginning. Airlift evokes a sense of patriotism that is so real, and not gimmicky as we see with other Indian films. Here everything is extremely sharp, real, gritty and raw. One feels as they have been thrown into a war zone, its a very film authentic. Hence its a very brutal, and sometimes hard to stomach, but its exhilarating. We rarely (if ever) get to see a film like this made in India which is made on such a huge scale, and talks of a real story of how 1,70,000 Indians were stuck in Kuwait during the time Iraq and Saddam Hussain attacked Kuwait in 1990. Its of international standards. What ones sees in the film will leave you teary eyed, you will be left gasping, and finally all Indians will feel proud of Airlift. This film is a gem that should be watched by all Indians, it left me speechless because we rarely get to see good cinema nowadays but Airlift is what we categorize as a classic. The human emotions, the amazing camera work, the great visual effects, the thrilling screenplay, and above all the best acting I have seen in a film for awhile by Akshay Kumar. Akshay Kumar deserves a national award for this film, the man is the film, he has given his all to Airlift. His act has a goose bump arising affect.<br/><br/>Story wise Ranjit Katyal is a shrewd businessman who liked enjoying the high society life of Kuwait. His wife Amrita Katyal is happy in her own world with her little daughter. Their world is turned upside down as Iraq invades Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Circumstances get the best or worst out of people. Ranjit who was a selfish businessman turns a new leaf as he watches his driver murdered in front of his own eyes. He along with a group of rich friends organizes a camp for 1, 70, 000 Indians. The subsequent days are a glorious account of his powerful negotiating skills with enemies as well as friends. <br/><br/>Acting wise Airlift probably has one of the best ensembles seen in a Hindi film after a long time. Akshay Kumar like stated before is MINDBLOWING. He is completely restraint, but what he conveys in his eyes, is what you call acting. I cant single out one scene,but he is outstanding in the whole film. Give him all the Indian film awards he deserves them. Nimrat Kaur character is completely real and she stands out in her monologue just after the interval when Tipu Sultan the ship is sent back. She is at her fiery best in that speech.Kumud Mishra is a revelation,this mans relentless act will leave you in awe. Prakash Belawadi is first rate as the annoying, but eager helpless south Indian wanting to go back home. Purab Kohli is good. Inaamulhaq is the only miscast, and is a caricature of a Iraqi general, his accent was horrible.<br/><br/>Airlift shows the true grim side of war, the stuff news channels don't want to cover, the reality of how thousands of Indians were left stranded in Kuwait during the 1990s in a oil war with Iraq. Within 24 hours all Indians rich or poor were left to beg on the streets, and Kuwaitis were being killed with no regard. When this is shown 15 min into the film, one knows an amazing film is coming and that Airlift shows all this in a extremely honest and true light. Nothing has been commercialized, or shown out of perspective. And thats the film biggest strength, being truthful, and not taking cinematic liberties. The film is gritty, raw, and real. Airlift is also very thrilling, and will leave you at the edge of your seat with your heat pounding at many instances. You cant move your eyes from the screen for even a second, its that gripping.The camera-work is amazing, and has shown war time Kuwait amazingly, everything just looks so real, and grim. The sets, the clothing, the cars, the production values in general are of international standards. The visual affects are first rate. The film has almost no negatives.The only thing that bothered me was the slow pace at times and the casting of Inaamulhaq as the general he was a complete miscast, and annoying. But were Airlift wins your heart is in the films true message of how brave India, and Indians are, we are responsible for the biggest evacuation in the history of the world. Its truly inspiring to think India actually airlifted 1, 70, 000 people out of a war zone. Its truly a bravo moment. The film is a classic piece of cinema for India. If America has saving private Ryan, Argo etc We have Airlift. We can proudly say that, thanks to Director Raja Menon who made such a inspiring true tale about India. He created such a huge canvas its truly applaud worthy. He made sure the film was of international standards in all aspects. The dialogues also standout especially my favourite "" Aadmi ki fitrat hi aisi hai Ibrahim,Jab chot lagti hai tab ma ma hi chillata hai.""That dialogue gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. The song tu bhoola jise is going to be the new Indian anthem, its a beautiful patriotic song. Finally the films biggest highlight is the last 20-30 min, and when you see the first flight take off, you will be left in tears. Once again bravo Mr. Akshay Kumar, what you did with this film, has made sure I am a fan forever.<br/><br/>Finally I will not preach anymore just go watch Airlift this republic day, and do yourself a favor. Its a must watch for all Indians, not because its a film that will make you feel patriotic, because its a cinematic masterpiece. Vande Mataram!!!<br/><br/>5/5* or 10/10"

","I am Akshay Kumar fan from childhood and I have watched almost all movies of Akshay Kumar. I feel Airlift is the best movie of Akshay Kumar. <br/><br/>The movie is based on true story and shot in locations which looks like real ones. The story is gripping and moves with decent pace. Viewers will literally feel a sense of sympathy for the Indians trapped in Kuwait.<br/><br/>Raja Krishna Menon has worked very hard and done his job very well. While watching movie, viewers don't find any loop holes in direction, story, screenplay.<br/><br/>Akshay has given his 100% and is best work of his career. Akshay deserves national award for this movie. Nimrat Kaur does her job very well. Purab Kohli make his present felt. All other actors has done their job quite efficiently.<br/><br/>Overall, Airlift is a great and entertaining film. A Must watch and a treat for classy audience."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.8/5 stars<br/><br/>""Airlift"" is Akshay Kumar's best movie since ""Khakee"" (yes, it's even better than ""Baby"") and his best performance bar none. Period! Gut-wrenching scenes, high-intensity shots, crackerjack dialogues, realistic tension, and patriotic without ever skirting jingoistic shores – the movie has all this, and then some. Based on the world's largest civilian evacuation, director Raja Krishna Menon takes on the challenge of turning a story known to all into a compelling watch and pens a nail-biting screenplay along with cowriters Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair, and Rahul Nangia, which will keep you fearful, hopeful and yet, unsure and uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Set in 1990, the film introduces us to a Kuwait-based business tycoon Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), an expat who has embraced his migrant country's ways and pointedly disassociates himself with anything Indian. When Iraqi forces commanded by Saddam Hussein invade Kuwait, the entire country is torn by war. As battle-tanks bomb the city, the progressive escalation of war finds millions displaced. A significant number of them happen to be migrant Indians. Katyal being one of the more privileged ones, instinctively plans his own exit along with wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur) and daughter Siya (Adiba Hussain). A sudden change of heart has Katyal taking charge of the safety of his distraught employees and anyone who reaches out to him. With the country's airports sealed by the invaders, options of exiting or entering the country are eliminated. The various escape plans that Katyal devises, makes up the rest of the film. There's hardly any suspense about how this film folds up, but the events that lead up to the inevitable denouement pack in enough punches to keep you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Films like ""Khakee"", ""Aankhen"", ""Baby"", and ""Special 26"" offered ample proof of how far Akshay Kumar has come from his ""Aflatoon"" days, but here he knocks it out of the park with a firm, sharp, and restrained yet emotional performance. Prudently, the filmmakers provide Nimrat Kaur with quite a meaty role to essay, and she supports Akshay exceptionally well – those acquainted with her acting prowess are well-versed with ability of essaying a range of emotions, and she executed the entire gamut here with effortless ease and conviction. All the other supporting players – particularly Inaamulhaq as a scheming, callous Iraqi Major, Prakash Belawadi as a perennially bickering refugee, and Kumud Mishra as the External Affairs bureaucrat who makes the operation possible – too, pull their weight in well-written roles.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Priya Seth deserves a special mention for strategically framing scenes to amplify the tension. Be it the shot taken through a car's smashed windshield or the aerial ones of tanks sliding down the desert, she manages to wordlessly convey terror and compel you to imagine the devastation.<br/><br/>I'll unequivocally declare that personally, I haven't enjoyed nor taken away so much from a Bollywood movie since ""Detective Byomkesh Bakshi"" released some ten months ago. You are filled with immense pride as the narrative arc of these everyday characters with indomitable spirits unfold, and a sea of emotions well up within you without ever spilling into melodramatic territory. A few brave souls saved the lives of 170,000 Indians at great personal risk, and it's time more Indian directors started telling stories like these that highlight heroic deeds of our countrymen amid both global and national scenarios. ""Airlift"" is just a brilliant movie overall, and no amount of accolades would suffice in bestowing praise on it. What a time to release it as well, coinciding with India's Republic Day. If you are in the mood to be entertained, watch ""Airlift"". If you are in the mood to be educated, watch ""Airlift"". If you are in a patriotic mood, watch ""Airlift"". You know what? Just watch ""Airlift""."

"dutta-satyaki","8","0","1","26 January 2016"," Patriotic and moving
","Movies like Airlift are not rare. We get our dose of patriotism every year. The only things that change are the setting and the cast. Airlift, however, manages to strike a chord with the truth it portrays. Firstly, in sharp contrast to Argo, the Indian govt did not jump to the rescue of Indians stuck in Kuwait. Any Indian knows how things move in the govt sector and this was aptly portrayed. It is always one or two odd people who get things moving and such was the case in Airlift too. There are a couple of scenes which can happen only in movies but those apart, the movie painted a very real picture of the largest ever evacuation program conducted by any country. When Akshay Kumar signs off in the end saying he is still cynical about a lot of issues in India but never asks what his country has done for him, he is echoing the sentiments of 1.7 lakh people who were part of Operation Airlift and many more."
