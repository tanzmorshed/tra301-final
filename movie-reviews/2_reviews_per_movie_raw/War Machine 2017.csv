","This film will generate anger because it throws a ""deadpan"" brick directly towards cultural dysfunction and mass delusion. ""War Machine,"" and Brad Pitt, even exceeded the deadpan message of ""Being There"" a film from a less cynical time in history but still relevant to this day. <br/><br/>""War Machine"" does a great job illustrating how disconnected the every-man has become in relation to reality. We live in a time where facts are now selectively chosen to support forgone perspectives rather than being absolute, universal, and irrefutable. <br/><br/>We live in a time where personage, perceptions, and public relations matter more than overview, objectives, conclusions, and endpoints. Reality has been set adrift. <br/><br/>It was a brave thing to produce this film because it speaks to a very narrow audience. Most people won't be entertained by the communication mechanism (deadpan) nor will the understand the message. Few people will be open to perspectives other than those which are preconceived. Some people are not aware and thus cannot acknowledge the wounds and damage that political lies have done to the American process and psyche. <br/><br/>To conclude our failed state of affairs, the affairs of a failed nation state (our nation state) I am not with him because he is certainly not with me no matter how much he tells me otherwise. The cohesion of leadership, truth, and the American way has left the building.<br/><br/>It is more of a shame that people won't understand this film, or won't want to. And that is how far we have fallen. Perhaps Rome fell the same way on the sword and misadventure of its own lies and delusion."
"Laiath","8","177","243","26 May 2017"," Excellent self-criticism
","Everything I saw about the movie before I saw the movie pointed to a bold critique of US foreign policy and war politics, so I didn't expect an action filled nail-biter. It did deliver what I expected, and did so phenomenally. The issues the movie brings up and the things the characters said really, truly couldn't have been said more openly and directly. As the narrator would have you know, it's going to fall on deaf ears where it matters the most, granted, but it's one heck of a catharsis session all the same.<br/><br/>Where the progression of events gets too slow, the brilliant acting comes to the rescue. Pitt's performance didn't look to me as smooth and believable as it used to be, but Tilda Swinton and Ben Kingsley blew my mind. With their impeccable accents and spot on mannerisms, it was near impossible to tell they were just actors (save for their very familiar faces). There were a few pretty funny lines, too.<br/><br/>To anyone who doesn't mind listening to dialogue and watching out for subtle goings-on, this movie is a must, MUST see."

","Apparently, a large number of Americans are unaware that we have been fighting several nasty wars on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for nearly two decades. The insane part of this is not the loss of lives, property or the reputation of the United States--it's that the awful truth has revealed that deep down, a large percentage of Americans just don't care about other people, don't care about good government, don't care about puppies or flowers or fresh baked cookies. A large number of Americans seem to be unplugged in some fundamental way. Soul-less. <br/><br/>This movie restores a little (very little) of my faith in my fellow McDonald's eaters. The outright horror of Afghanistan is portrayed as a joke, because, dad-gummit, showing Kirk Douglas raging at generals and three sorry dupes being shot in cold blood ""to encourage the others"" just doesn't have the same punch it used to have. People used to expect a cocktail to be mixed with pride by a skilled bartender. Now, if it doesn't contain a severed finger it's good to go. Our ability to judge our own lives is now suspect. This film dares to aim a punch straight at the nose of the al-mighty. If it misses just a little--well, ten out of ten for the effort. <br/><br/>I could not stand to watch another sappy piece of propaganda showing some babe-a-licious soldiers doing their duty in some god-forsaken part of Southern California while wondering ""what is it all for"" aloud. It's not for anything. This whole place is out of order. You're out of order. <br/><br/>At one time, being ""anti-war"" was normal for Americans. Now, things are worse. It's a mess, and it gets worse every day. We have to do something. If present trends continue, then some clownish general will roll down Pennsylvania Avenue and arrest the government. WAKE UP. Films like this are small but vital steps in the right direction. Brad Pitt did the right thing here. We need to end illegal wars and stop crimes against humanity in the name of the people of the U.S.A."
"tastytomatoes","7","48","67","1 June 2017"," Why? Why did we have the war?
","First off, the criticism is too harsh. From a directorial aspect, this is not a perfect movie. Yet the movie clearly goes over the head of some people. There are numerous laughs big and small scattered through the movie where you laugh at the absurdity of the characters and the unfolding of events. At times it also gets informative and at times drama-serious. When the movie ends you feel like to have gone through a journey with General Glenn McMahon, an inside look into the relationship and mechanism of America's war in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>War Machine delivers its message and will prompt you into thinking. The pacing is slower at times but then catches the speed. Great chemistry between the cast with solid performances. Brad Pitt is excellent, giving a unique and strong performance that radiates as the film goes on.<br/><br/>An absurd story at an absurd time, this is a unique movie worth watching for its theme and characters."

","I enjoyed it a lot! as a veteran I thought it was hilarious. It also did a decent job at showcasing some of the stuff that makes us soldiers tick, for instance all the political hoopla you have to go through. I have never reviewed a movie on here before, but I felt like I definitely had to talk about this one."
"ReelLifeReviews","7","77","118","26 May 2017"," Netflix brings it
","War Machine - A satirical but honest look at the treadmill of war.<br/><br/>First off, Brad Pitt is essentially a caricature in this movie. I kept going back and forth on whether he was brilliant or miserable in his performance. I found myself feeling the same way I did when seeing him in Allied late last year. There are scenes when he is absolutely dialed in to the role and what's going on around him. And there are a handful of scenes where you'd think someone is just reading him his lines off-screen. He's been frustratingly inconsistent these last two outings.<br/><br/>I had no trouble deciphering the performance level of the surrounding cast, as they all came to play. From the big names of Ben Kingsley and Tilda Swinton, to still familiar names of Anthony Michael Hall and Topher Grace, I was impressed. My favorite performance would have to go to one of the smaller roles played by Lakeith Stanfield. I'd seen him earlier this year in Get Out, but he had a better opportunity to shine here as an absolutely emotionally broken marine.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is very quirky and actually has some pretty funny lines. The second half all but abandons the comedic tone and shifts into a full fledged war drama. The end result is satisfying, but that contrast is pretty jarring. It would have been more successful to mix the paint a bit more or just choose one color.<br/><br/>Netflix pulled out the big guns putting up $60 million for the distribution rights to the film. Later this year they are also backing a loose follow up to 2009's Moon (please see this underrated film if you haven't already) and breaking the bank with a $100 Martin Scorsese film with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in 2018. Netflix is quickly changing the game in the world of cinema. Don't be surprised to see the awards shows tweak their rules to allow for streaming content down the road.<br/><br/>So pop some popcorn and reserve your couch to see this film of grandiosity and failure. Not exactly your typical recipe to Netlix and Chill, but I'm not one to judge."

","I watch the movie the day it released. I should say its entertaining and partially funny. I saw lots of people here are very negative about the movie, well, that's a reality of the US/NATO operations in Afganistan! <br/><br/>I like this sentence from the movie: ""We cannot help them and kill them at the same time."""

"robertm-07545","10","37","57","4 June 2017"," Too sad to be called a comedy
","This new Netflix original directed by David Michod is a powerful statement not just about the futility of our 16-year war in Afghanistan, but more importantly, the whole concept of counterinsurgency as outlined in the Army's Counterinsurgency Field Manual (FM 3-24 *MCWP 3-33.5). Every set piece scene hits home displaying the ignorance, the futility, and the hubris of our efforts in Afghanistan. Even when some politicians and enlightened officers realized the impossibility of ""winning"" they were often muted in their opposition. We like to think we will always win. We are the best, the most professional, most well-equipped military force the world has ever known. How could we lose? To a bunch of ragtag insurgents with flip flops and rusty AK-47s? More to the point, who was willing to say openly that we might? The movie describes a series of commanders each believing (some more than others) that he had the solutions for winning that his predecessors did not. The scenes where the officer talks to the Afghan people about our desire to ""liberate"" them I found particularly gut wrenching. The Afghan people thought they were free. Who were these alien, Christian invaders to tell them they were there to help them as they smashed around the country destroying villages and killing (accidently for the most part) civilians? This is not black humor. It is too sad for that. The scene in Karzai's bedroom where the general, while demanding the Afghan President authorize an offensive that was hours away from starting while at the same time telling him that the United States did not want to be shown as an occupying power and that he, Karzai had some real authority was another painful look at the reality of our involvement there. This movie merely states the blindingly obvious, but that doesn't seem to be understood by a new set of politicians and generals who believe that with a few more troops and more intelligent use of the COIN manual, victory will be ours. Sadly it will not win any new ""hearts and minds""."
"siderite","8","22","32","24 September 2017"," Intriguing perspective on the US war on whatever
","It wasn't a movie I enjoyed very much, but it was a good movie. You can feel it in your guts. It's a description of the US operations in Afghanistan, and I had expected a liberal viewpoint that made fun of the mess there. But it wasn't so. It actually showed viewpoints from multiple perspectives.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays a general, newly appointed to the region in order to ""fix things"". And he is trying to. He fights bureaucracy, politicians, and insurgents alike in order to get things done. He has a faithful group of subordinates who worship him and help him do whatever he wants. Ironically, his technical approach makes him the enemy of the US administration, which only needs to show they are trying, without actually having to succeed. Ben Kingsley has a few scenes as president Karzai that are ridiculously funny, too. ""But I am acting as a leader. I am unavailable"", he says in one scene. Hilarious.<br/><br/>In the end, one cannot but sympathize with a guy who wants to end the war, militarily or course, by unequivocally winning it, regardless of what human issues are hindering the victory. He has a job to do, even if it's obvious no one wants him to do it. The movie shows how these kinds of ""wars"" were never meant to be won, even if you had someone actually trying to.<br/><br/>Bottom line: A movie is impressive when it manages to portray a US army general as a simple task oriented technician, hired like you would hire a plumber to do a job. It gets even more impressive when it shows how impossible that job really is. And the acting was great. The mood was a little too deadpan for me. It is something that amuses you internally while you wonder why everything is moving so slow. I believe this was deliberate, in order for the viewer to understand a little bit of how slow things are really moving in the real world."
"mxmtitov","10","35","56","27 May 2017"," Wow, what a movie, an eye-opener really. Won't be an easy watch for hardline believers.
","Just finished watching War Machine with Brad Pitt on Netflix. Wow, what a movie and an eye- opener. Really lets you put things into perspective and see the world through another person's eyes and ideas. Having watched it left me with an utmost respect for the protagonist Gen. Glen McMahon (portrayed after real life persona Gen. Stanley McChrystal). What a guy. Need to read his books now. Warning: Obama is portrayed quite controversially there, and not just implicitly. That trick with the meeting on Air Force One, wow what an asshole move, makes you question the integrity of the president you so long considered ideal. It is healthy to look at things through the eyes of people with views that may be different from yours. But it can be painful: if your point of view is unmovable, it can lead to frustration and disappointment. So a fair warning to those hardline viewers: it won't be an easy viewing if you can't consider other points of view or accept that what you believe may be different from reality."
"cillianleddy-15839","7","39","64","26 May 2017"," A very interesting anti-war movie.
","War Machine is a movie about the absurdity of the war of Afghanistan and the absurdity of American foreign policy in general. Therefore the tone of the film is absurdist to reflect this. Brad Pitt's portrayal of General McMahon is absurdly over the top and quite deliberately so in order to reflect the general's absurd actions and attitude, his interactions with the other characters including the politicians are baffling and confusing which again reflects the baffling and incoherent nature of America's policy towards Afghanistan and the Middle East. How do you wage bloody war and build a nation up at the same time? The two do not go hand in hand.<br/><br/>War Machine's exposes just how much of a wild goose chase the battle against the Taliban is, how do you defeat an enemy that are often nothing more than disgruntled locals who have had quite enough of American soldiers bombing civilians homes and killing their children, without committing genocide? The film makers have reflected this by showing the Gen. and his men embarking on a wild goose chase of Europe in a futile attempt to secure more troops to the cause and get some face to face communication with the President of the U.S. The theme is quite clearly wild goose chases galore.<br/><br/>Overall I feel War Machine is an interesting anti-war movie that is much more a dark comedy drama than a clear satire which is what it was wrongly billed as. It isn't the funniest movie in the world but it has its' laugh out loud moments. Ultimately the mixture of satirical comedy, thought provoking drama, and taut action scenes blend together to tell a story which at it's essence aims to provoke everyone who watches this movie to ask, what were/are the Americans doing in Afghanistan? 7 out of 10 and some good performances and score."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","6","7","17 June 2017"," Not really fulfilling in terms of both drama and comedy, yet there is some appeal to it
","""War Machine"" is a very recent release from Netflix and the newest movie starring Oscar-nominated actor and Oscar-winning producer Brad Pitt. Most recently, he has been more in the headlines because of his divorce from Angelina Jolie, but here we have something new from him in the field that really counts: the movie industry. The film runs for slightly over two hours and this includes a great deal of credits. Writer and director is David Michôd, the man who is mostly known for the Oscar-nominated ""Animal Kingdom"", but no doubt a film starring Brad Pitt will exceed the latter in terms of popularity for sure. Pitt has a tendency right now to appear in war-themed films and this one adds to that tendency. Here he plays a renowned army general who is ordered to Afghanistan to ""get things right again"". Or you could replace that term with another dozen of really vague statements what his task there actually is. It never becomes clear throughout the film, but that is absolutely intended. Basically they do not want him to cause any trouble and show to the outside that they care about the US involvement there and that the best men are in charge, even if their real intentions are clearly different. One example for that is a scene when Pitt's character is instructed why heroine is cultivated instead of cotton.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a fairly good watch I must say. i did not like some of Pitt's other recent military-based stuff, but this one really is more about politics than about the war itself and war movies just aren't really to my liking. Pitt himself gives a performance that is always on the verge of gimmicky, but it is still memorable somehow looking at the character he created. You can never be sure if he is just a tool of the powerful and mighty, a man with a mission, a good guy, a smart guy or the exact opposite and that adds something interesting there. One can certainly not complain about a lack of layers in the central character. Oscar winners Ben Kingsley and Tilda Swinton play important characters for the film, even if they only appear in one scene each. They did make sure that nobody takes away any attention from Pitt, that much is safe. Also as evidence for that it can be said that all the supporting players with a solid deal of screen time are played by actors who really aren't that famous. It is all about Pitt's character from start to finish. The reception I see was probably not good enough to turn this into an awards vehicle in an attempt that he finally gets his first acting Oscar. By the way, this is a Netflix production and the name Pitt in here shows that they really can get everybody they want these days. But if quality films like this one here are the outcome, then I don't mind it at all. As a whole, it was fun to watch Pitt from start to finish and the story was also good enough for me to give this one a thumbs-down, even if I would say that here and there the film could have been cut shorter, perhaps down to 105 minutes. Nothing too bad, however, go see it."

","'WAR MACHINE': Four Stars (Out of Five)   A satirical war film based on the nonfiction book 'The Operators' (by  Michael Hastings), about the firing of United States Army General  Stanley McChrystal. The movie was written and directed by David Michod  (who also helmed the 2010 critically acclaimed crime drama 'ANIMAL  KINGDOM', and the 2014 post-apocalyptic thriller 'THE ROVER'). It stars  Brad Pitt, Emory Cohen, Anthony Michael Hall, RJ Cyler, Anthony Hayes,  Topher Grace, John Magaro, Scoot McNairy, Daniel Betts, Aymen  Hamdouchi, Will Poulter, Lakeith Stanfield, Meg Tilly, Alan Ruck, Ben  Kingsley and Tilda Swinton. It was released on Netflix to mostly  positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it too.  The story is narrated by Rolling Stones reporter Sean Cullen (McNairy).  He was assigned to interview Four-star General Glen McMahon (Pitt), a  fictional character based on General Stanley McChrystal, and his men,  about their service in Afghanistan. Cullen explains how McMahon was  hired to end the war there, but instead he felt the obsessive need to  win it. This ultimately lead to his firing (sadly).  The movie is a pretty insightful look at war, and those who have to be  involved with it. Some very much love their job, like the General in  this movie, and (as the film points out) they usually mean well. The  film does a great job of making characters like that (that might be  played as villains in other movies) very sympathetic. Pitt does a great  job in the role too, and Michod is definitely a very skilled director.  I was touched by this film multiple times; and it's funny, and quite  depressing, all at the same time as well. If you have Netflix, I'd  definitely give it a try."
"SnoopyStyle","6","17","26","27 May 2017"," ups and downs
","Gen. Glen McMahon (Brad Pitt) is no non-sense soldier. He lives a Spartan life often away from his family. He and his team such as the always shouting Greg Pulver (Anthony Michael Hall) are called in to cleanup the Afganistan quagmire. He is told to push the needle and not request for more troops. Instead, he is driven to win and sees his way where everyone else has failed. He uses any means to get his way while not getting his meeting with Obama. He finds President Karzai (Ben Kingsley), an isolated corrupt leader. Media consultant Matt Little (Topher Grace) suggests getting him an article in Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>This dark comedy is too real to be funny. If Strangelove actually happened, the absurd movie would be less fun. One is always reminded that real people died here and there because the character of McMahon is based on a real person. While there are interesting bits, the general sense of this movie is one of tired resignation.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's the Rolling Stones reporter but I'm reminded of Almost Famous. In that movie, the reporter is the protagonist and he's the eyes with which the audience sees the story. The rock star is a subject who is slowly revealed. In this movie, we are given only the narration of reporter Sean Cullen for the most part. He shows up for a limited role later in the movie. McMahon is the protagonist and we're stuck with him for good and for ill.<br/><br/>Of all the characters, the most compelling is the 'confused' Marine Cpl. Billy Cole. His first scene with McMahon is devastating. His face is haunting. What he says resonates more than any other character. In the end, he is a minor character. His other scene is another compelling sequence as his squad goes into a hostile town. Again he is more compelling than anyone else and it is emotionally draining. This movie could have been great but McMahon can't be the protagonist. He is an absurd side character like Karzai in this movie."

Its like someone wrote a serious war movie, then the script was given to a satirist who just simply couldn't pull it together. The movies narration was meant to be the guiding voice of reason among madness.

","""War Machine"" satirically depicts a fictionalized version of Stanley McChrystal,, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) from his arrival in country to (spoiler) his sacking by the president..<br/><br/>The production value is excellent, with a lot of recognizable faces, many of them big (Pitt, Kingsley, and even a cameo by Russell Crowe). It uses real military and Afghan-specific military gear (how it got US Army support, I'll never know) and even gets the uniforms of coalition allies right. For vets, however, prepare to roll your eyes at the obligatory use of the salute as the perceived highest honor a military member can make.<br/><br/>The source material is the late Michael Hastings' book which I have not read, but having read his infamous Rolling Stone article on McChrystal, the figurative tone and voice of the narrator (based on Hastings) seems about right, cynical and contemptuous of his subject. Unless you lean way to the left or simply not a supporter of military use in Afghanistan, the narration gets pretty preachy and even downright wrong (about the success rate of insurgencies, for example),a somewhat unnecessary distraction.<br/><br/>Even for satire, where personalities are flattened and exaggerated and action is simplified, this film still struggles to add even a little depth. Pitt spends most of the film either looking confused, squinting, or saying ""with all due respect"". Anthony Michael Hall seems to just sneer, swear, and yell. Of course, Americans, particularly the military, are naively optimistic and openly disrespectful of other nationalities and their commander in chief. And wars and warfare can be summed up in glib and ideological oversimplifications.<br/><br/>The story manages to hit a bunch of themes and subject matters. There is commentary on the American way of war, the impact of deployments on marriage, the wisdom of military intervention, the politics of coalition building, and the dynamics of leadership. But the manner in which it chooses to do this constantly shifts.<br/><br/>I think it strives to be a dark comedy, but therein lies its ultimate shortfall. It doesn't know what it wants to be. Which is a shame because the funny parts are sincerely funny (Pitt's character defending the honor of his Afghan aide-de-camp as ""the only Afghan in the room"", Pitt and his White House (or SecDef?) civilian contact trying to end a video conference, and Ben Kingsly's hilarious (however infrequent) take on President Karzai all come to mind.) But the tone itself is multiple personalities. While it is always mocking (as satires are supposed to be) and skeptical, sometimes it's cutting to the bone, other times very light and whimsical, still other times deeply serious. I won't make the Roger Ebert mistake of speculating what the movie could have been about, but it seems to slink between being (1) a strident anti-military/anti-war/anti-America polemic or (2) a humorous parody of power and bureaucracy or (3) a character assassination of Stanley McChrystal.<br/><br/>It's a watchable and entertaining film with a good look, lots of questions, and steady acting. At end, however, I feel like the conflicted character Marine corporal Billy Cole who states his dilemma, which incidentally is restated in the song playing over the end credits, ""I'm confused."" Yep, so is the movie and so am I."

","This movie tried to overlay a childish caricature of the Afghan War and its actors onto a flat and uninspiring story with unbelievably deranged and almost mentally incompetent characters it was clearly attempting to defame. Indeed, the unjust treatment of General McChrystal, who is the thinly veiled protagonist in the character of General McMahon, is continued in this 60 million dollar film. Ironically, the movie would have been a lot more interesting with some dramatic irony. Perhaps they could have contraposed the deranged, unjust and unreliable narrator, to a tragic hero, as opposed to recycling the cliché of the out of touch military man who is megalomaniacally seeking his own glory at the expense of lives of his men and the poor civilians who have to pay the price?<br/><br/>Even though American Sniper stood back from making clear political judgments on the Iraq War, it successfully managed to capture the man and the American Spirit, so it was far more powerful than tired, smug pacifism of Bore Machine."

But the attempt of making a humorous sidelong glance on war, just didn't really work out. At the same time, the movie gradually moves into a more emotional territory, which honestly makes it more confusing than appealing in contrast to the satire-elements. <br/><br/>War Machine is a movie I almost like. There are some really good scenes, the premise of the movie itself is good in theory, but the result just isn't that appealing. The mixture of drama and satire just makes the movie insignificant and messy.<br/><br/>The trailers indicated that this would be a good dark comedy. But it's hard to call it that. It certainly gets dark at times, and it's genuinely funny at other times, but it never hits both at the same time.<br/><br/>Brad Pitts performance is very good, I would say one of the better in his career.

The movie gives no attempt to develop the characters, with all but Bitt's character being entirely one dimensional, and even though Bitt does have a character, it's a poor and uninteresting one. He gives a laughably over-the-top and often cringe-worthy performance, showing that he was absolutely not right for this role.<br/><br/>As said, it completely falls short as either a war movie or a comedy, both of which it's listed as here on IMDb. There is only one action scene, and I use the term loosely - all it is is a two minute scene which only shows one side shooting a few bullets, and that's it. The comedy on the other hand is totally unfunny and virtually none of it lands. I honestly spent the entire film but knowing this was meant to be a comedy. <br/><br/>So we are left with a film that has no suspense, no tension, no action or effective comedy to take it off the ground.

I don't know whether the script was so bad he felt he had to give his character all sorts of odd flaws and quirks but having served in the Military, there is nothing about any of the characters that was real, not would *any* of them act like that, especially at their level and rank. Their dialogue is completely flawed and even if they were trying to portray the team as one step removed from a bunch of frat boys it's still so far away from being engaging it's awful. The story is poorly told as well and from beginning to end it fails to deliver any form of satisfaction in terms of content, entertainment, or any other metric with which you might judge a good film.

I suppose that some will praise Pitt's gravely voice, with which he says nothing. Some think of this movie as an anti-war statement. At best it was a mild statement about how poorly our leaders and military understand the situation in AFGH. That lack of understanding can be no shock, given Vietnam, Iraq, Somalia, and too many others. Luckily, if one has a Netflix subscription, one may watch if ""for free"". A waste of time, however."
"LaLaLandSucks","4","78","166","26 May 2017"," A satire on war that is confused what it wants to be.
","This addition to Netflix seems much like a waste of money. The budget is 60 million and 70% of it very much looks like a TV film. The direction is as standard as the cinematography. At one point, it broke the 180 degree rule during a 60 minute interview, it just didn't work. Brad Pitt plays a general who is often serious, over the top, and funny? His performance is fine, aside from his crazy one eye mannerism. He's able to capture multiple emotions with several looks and it kinda works. The performances from the supporting cast are fine. They are just not given much screen time. Lakeith Stanfield is a stand out. His scenes were brief, but he was able to display an impressive range of emotion. The biggest problem with this film is it's just flat. There's no stake or ambition. It is a very safely crafted film. It is generic and uninteresting told with heavy narration and exposition. I guess the film is trying to display how some military folks have an obsession with war. The general here is quite irresponsible, egotistical, and seems deranged. The same with his crew as well, but just not as much. There's a large amount of tonal shifts from being serious to comedic and the film doesn't know which one to choose, so it ends up uneven altogether. There are times where the film switches hard rock to rap then to classical music creating uneven scenes with abrupt jump cuts that just makes no sense. I am guessing it was meant to be comedic, but it just didn't work. Overall, I think this film is quite a mess.<br/><br/>4/10."
"russneedels","3","25","50","30 May 2017"," Confusion Over Content and Approach
","One of the oddest movies I've seen in a while. I assumed from the preview of the Brad Pitt character that the movie would be a satire or comedy. Unfortunately, the movie seems to wander from political commentary to drama to satire... a big melting pot that doesn't evolve.<br/><br/>The only surprise is that the overall message about Obama was that he was an ""orator"" and incompetent about running the military. While that message is not surprising, what was surprising was the liberal Hollywood celebs like Pitt that sold the message.<br/><br/>If you are left leaning, then you won't be let down as this movie released on Memorial Day (choke...) brings it back home with the narrator firmly planting an anti-American rhetoric and anti-war message. At least the message is consistent since the end of the Vietnam War,"

","Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, Lee Marvin and David Niven were war heroes that made great movies. Brad Pitt, George Clooney are Hollywood liberals that try to make war movies when it fills their bank accounts. And it shows, they are so unbelievable in those roles it makes me shudder.

But alas they will most likely be doing something worthwhile with their lives."
"ss0187","9","17","32","26 May 2017"," War Machine is a compelling and multi-faceted masterpiece
","War Machine is a profound and politically socially resonant absurdist modern masterpiece that our world needs right now. Brad gives a brilliant, canny, zany, but dark portrait of a general who is undermined by his own hubris, lack of awareness, but also underscored by the flaws of the industrial military complex. <br/><br/>This is by far David Michod's best movie and it breaks my heart that a biased agenda against this film is really causing it to be underrated and maligned. War Machine is leagues above Fury and a number of Brad's most recent movies. This is a compelling and deft insight into military policy and the negative ramifications of occupation/war that the audience rarely sees in movies. It deconstructs the ignorant and yet earnest or possibly well intentioned mechanics of war and invasion. It revels in the gray area of the futility and irony of war.<br/><br/>The cast gives impressive performances across the board. Lakeith Stanfield, John Magaro, Topher Grace, Anthony Michael Hall, Meg Tilly, and the entire cast give great performances. I wish the film would be nominated for a SAG ensemble because the acting is strong and bold across the board. It is one of Brad's top performances ever. War Machine is an anti-establishment and relativist film in nature. There are no traditional antagonists or protagonists to root for. It will get under the skin of liberals and it will anger the extreme conservatives.It is not for the far right or even the far left. This film is enthralling for people who truly understand it. It is an intellectual and emotional journey for the invested viewer who is on the same wavelength. <br/><br/>The cinematography from Dariusz Wolski is amazing and the original score from Nick Cave is hauntingly beautiful. The film was so profound and engaging for me. I am very shocked about the reviews, I knew there would be a hateful fringe faction. I know there are critics who are very biased against Brad's movies but they are doing a disservice to the film industry by attacking a film they do not want to understand or accept. It appears they are too invested into making War Machine a controversial debacle for Netflix. Ten years from now or even 20 years from now, this film will be viewed as powerful. <br/><br/>All of the dialogue is sharp, multi-faceted, and full of very strong context for people who comprehend the meanings/references underneath. It is humorous and engaging but it require a special kind of intelligence and a certain sociopolitical attitude to truly embrace it. I found myself nodding along in agreement every time the script kept going on about the ramifications of invading countries and it even addresses what the people in Afghanistan has to go through. "" You can't help people and kill them at the same time"", is a perfect tag line. It is a tonally blunt satire about the military and the current inadequate foreign policies that will wake people up. This film resonated with me very profoundly. Brad's performance displays the ignorance and humanity of the General, while displaying a range of both dramatic and sly comedic overtones that is very tongue in cheek. This film is very impressive and should have been a top Oscar contender given how timely and crucial the subject material is right now. <br/><br/>This is a intelligent movie about a stupid war where there are no winners.<br/><br/>I am disgusted that American Sniper and Hacksaw Ridge received such strong critical acclaim while the biased critics are tearing apart an excellent film like War Machine to shreds. War Machine is our generation's Dr. Strangelove. People may not realize it now but cinemaphiles and historians, in the future, will realize that War Machine was ahead of its time and an incendiary portrait of war in America while being revolutionary its in sardonic attitude about America's foreign policy at the time. David Michod is a genius."

","I think this movie had a lot of good and interesting ideas. It just didn't execute them well at all. The film is narrated by Scoot McNairy, and he says a lot of introspective things that could have made for a fascinating look at the psyche of a war general when the war is waning. That's a great idea, and one that could have made for a really compelling movie. Unfortunately, all War Machine does is tell us these things, without ever showing it to us. There is no clear, discernible story. It simply follows General McMahon around to a lot of different places. So it's hard to latch onto where the film was headed, or what the overall point actually was. Speaking of McMahon, Brad Pitt seriously overacts in this movie. He felt like a caricature, from the voice to the facial expressions. There was nothing natural or realistic about it, and it just felt like a cartoon character. Because of this, I could never see McMahon as a real, genuine character. I was just watching Brad Pitt doing a poor job on screen. I'm not sure exactly whose fault that was. The voice and the ticks could have been Pitt's ideas, but it also could have been all the director's, David Michôd. Regardless of whose ideas they were, it simply came across as ridiculous. An unbelievable main character, coupled with the lack of a clear story, made it incredibly hard to get into the movie..."

The point of the movie is to preach this bizarre anti-war philosophy, that completely ignores the history of human wars (where insurgencies were defeated. It's not like Afghans invented insurgency). <br/><br/>The one-dimensional characters shows how black-and-white and simple- minded people wrote this movie.<br/><br/>What a waste of money and acting power too. The actors are good but the characters and plot is just boring and bland.<br/><br/>It's like watching a 2 hour movie of someone angry at a general, so they made a movie whining about a general or a war."

"Nolamoviedude","4","2","2","27 December 2018"," A modern Dr Strangelove you are not
","I think this is Netflix's 1st big budget production and it stars Brad Pitt in a satirical look at war. Pitt is an overzealous Army general wanting to win the war in Afghanistan. Pitt's accent is annoying, is he trying to be Norman Schwarzkopf from the 1st Gulf War? Anyway it gets political all too often, tries to be funny then towards the end when a Marine accidentally kills a kid, gets serious. Pitt simply delivers his father a big bag of cash to make it all better. The movie ends with a Rolling Stone article of Pitt's character criticizing the President, which gets him fired. The last scene has Russel Crowe walking down the halls showing there's a new General to continue the never ending vicious cycle.<br/><br/>Definitely slanted towards the anti-war side and is very political without really being right or left wing. The film makes sure to insult Obama to make sure we all know this isn't left wing propaganda. The movie does that type of thing a lot. I think the idea of the movie is good but the execution could have been better."

","I am usually interested in netflixs original products and this film has Brad Pitt in it so I had some interest in this film but yeah this film is pretty poor. The premise of this film sees a respected charismatic war general sent to Afghanistan to sort out the war effort that is happening over there. Brad pitt plays the general in this film and he is very good in this film, he has a lot of charisma in this film and he was easily the funniest character in this film. He is overacting a little bit but it does really work for this role and alludes to the fact that he is the only person I cared about in this film. The supporting cast in this film has some pretty decent actors in this film such as topher grace, will poulter and RJ cyler who was the best part of the recent power rangers movie. But nobody was given anything to do in this film and you won't care about anybody in this film other then brad Pitt. The story in this film is just really bland, nothing is really going on except a lot of political dialogue that you just won't care about. The film has a really poor structure in it and when the end happens you will wonder what the point of this film really was. The film is marketed as a dark comedy and I will say that I did chuckle at some of the humour but I don't believe it is that dark at all. Towards the end of this film it tries to get more dramatic and it totally misses the mark. The style of the film is all over the place, the tone is so inconsistent that you won't really be able to follow everything accurately because you won't care. Overall this is another disappointment from a Netflix movies and it really isn't worth a watch at all."
"coleco2000","7","19","39","26 May 2017"," Clearly Portrays the Confusion of War
","Not knowing anything about the movie I was surprised that I was watching Brad Pitt with gravely George C Scott (Patton) voice and awkward stiff movements fool me, not knowing who he was! He looks so young. The movie did a great job of revealing the confusion of power that is the military and government in taking on a task of war against an enemy that likely would never have become an enemy if we had never moved against other powers in the region and caused the bitterness and anger we now face. Yet, it happened and the USA is now the great Satan and evil that is being fought against by terrorists and fighting in the middle-east. The movie finds the humor in military and government attempts to move politically and strategically with the great acting and directing. Many name stars and stars of the past make appearances, some stars that you might not immediately recognize, and carry the humor in the movie plot-line. And while it is not a strong plot-line it serves the purpose, reveals some of the ridiculous reasoning that surely happens in war, and creates an often believable mostly fast paced action that keeps your attention throughout the course of the movie. While the military is NOT the inept fighting force portrayed, the action of government intervention and politics truly must be seen as the master hindrance of warfare, and rightly so perhaps. The movie does make you think about things! As it was a little silly, and a little weak in plot, I knocked off some stars. But it was certainly funny and worth watching."

","""War Machine"" is one of those movies that we regret to have spent time watching even on video. The IMDb hype associated to the names of Brad Pitt and a long list of cameos convince the viewer that watching this awful film would be worthwhile. Brad Pitt is a caricature of actor and recalls Jeff Bridges speaking in many of his last works. There are some witty and ironic criticism to the American invasions, especially in the Afheganistan, but maybe this is the only funny joke.

","There are definitely some good laughs in here grounded in our well-known but sad history in Vietnam and Iran. This Netflix movie takes place in Afghanistan with none other than Brad Putt as the commanding general, full of himself. The general is patterned after a Westmoreland-type character who thinks that the sheer power of his charisma will win the day. We then see how badly this approach works in the Mideast, where true leadership among the natives is simply nonexistent (Ben Kingsley plays an Afghan leader more concerned with his new TV and remaining unavailable than he does leading his country). This movie asks the question: If the natives won't even support their own leader, how are they going to follow an American General? There's no action in this movie, so it's basically a personality driven comedy. In Kubrick's STRANGELOVE, there's a better balance of suspense, action, and comedic personalities. See it instead if you want to see a movie about the futility of war and the dangers of placing too much power in the hands of the military."

He would have been served well watching Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies to understand how to pull of a silly character who thinks too much of himself.Instead he tries to be funny as in a sitcom and sadly even fails at that.

I think Brad Pitt done a good job portraying the general which would be even a difficult role for the general himself. the general and his staff excellently illustrate the adage ""you don't have to be mad to work here but it helps"" or ""you don't have to be mad to work here but you will be by the time you leave"". overall a good effort from netflix and a brave one as one can be easily demonized for apparent anti-military stance in the current USA (thank u for your service). It is a bit misleading in the film where it is remarked that insurgencies are rarely successfully put down by force when in fact history teaches the opposite.All empires have beaten insurgencies by force and thru complete anilation of the insurgents. the Afgan situation is not even explained by the fact that the forces to put down the insurgency are ""alien"". in fact e.g in India home of continual insurgencies since independence the govt. manufactures ""alien"" forces to put down insurgencies by recruiting troops from other regions and ethnic groups to those of the insurgents and wiping them out thru foul or fair means. This matters not as some other insurgency erupts else where by some other abused ethnic group. The British empire thru Draconian methods was in the continuous process of putting down insurgencies and the US and Canada also have considerable experience subduing the 1st Nations and quite successfully if held against current situations. hence their unstinted instinctual belief in a military solution thru violent attrition as has succeeded countless times afore. methinks the world has turned."

"makleen2","9","8","16","28 September 2017"," Hollywood can learn a thing or two from this Netflix production
","War Machine (2017) stars Brad Pitt as General Glen McMahon, a fictional commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2009. It is a savage parody of General Stanley McChrystal and the U.S. and Coalition War in Afghanistan, based on The Operators (2012) by Michael Hastings, a sleazy reporter for Rolling Stone and BuzzFeed. Hastings' hit piece on General McChrystal in Rolling Stone led to his resignation as Commander of the International Security Assistance Force and retirement from the Army in 2010.<br/><br/>The film opens as hard-fighting General Glen McMahon arrives in Afghanistan to whip things into shape and finally win the war. The narrator tells us General McMahon is a soldier's soldier, a West Point and Ranger School graduate who eats once a day, gets four hours of sleep a night, and runs seven miles every morning.<br/><br/>His staff includes a civilian press adviser, Matt Little (Topher Grace), X.O. Colonel Cory Staggart (John Magaro), Major General Greg Pulver (Anthony Michael Hall), ""tech whiz"" Andy Moon (RJ Cyler), Navy Seal Major Pete Duckman (Anthony Hayes), Admiral Simon Ball (Daniel Betts), and Sergeant Willy Dunne (Emory Cohen). Together, they believe they can bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.<br/><br/>General McMahon quickly learns he's up against some tougher opponents than the Taliban, including obstinate government officials, reluctant NATO allies, and a hostile press. Even U.S. soldiers, given voice by Marine Corporal Billy Cole (Lakeith Stanfield), are skeptical of their mission and its chances for success. McMahon must use unconventional tactics and the force of his personality to fully implement his grand plan for victory.<br/><br/>In the military, commanders are given a high degree of discretion over their troops. They are accustomed to getting what they want and not hearing the word ""no."" Like Colonel Joshua Chamberlain says in the movie Gettysburg (1993), there's nothing so much like God on earth as a general on a battlefield. So it's easy to see how frustrated generals can be when constantly butting heads with civilian authorities who think they know the general's job better than he does. War Machine artfully and humorously depicts this situation.<br/><br/>Every character in War Machine is portrayed authentically, and the actors and actresses perform marvelously. With a few lines, Ben Kingsley, who plays former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, perfectly captures the sardonic indifference of a powerless man supposedly holding a position of power.<br/><br/>""I am behaving like a leader,"" he tells McMahon after McMahon urges him to endorse his offensive in Helmand Province. ""I am as unavailable to you as your own president."" It's a particularly biting insult, considering how President Obama brushed off McMahon on the runway earlier in the film. Moments later, he says, ""You have my approval, general. We both know it was never really mine to give. But I thank you for inviting me to participate in the theater of it all."" <br/><br/>Meg Tilly gives another great performance as McMahon's wife, Jeannie, who has seen her husband less than 30 days a year for the past eight years. Practically strangers, the distance between them is palpable. Yet there is a genuine attempt to remain close and supportive. So many military spouses have gone through a similar experience, particularly at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. She puts a human face on the cost of General McMahon's drive to succeed.<br/><br/>In the end, General McMahon flies off alone to meet the U.S. President and is forced to resign as a result of negative publicity from an article in Rolling Stone. A new team, led by a tough, hard-fighting general lands in Afghanistan to take his place.<br/><br/>In less capable hands, War Machine had the potential to be another Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (2016) or Lions for Lambs (2007), contemporary critiques of the War on Terror that just come across as rushed and ham-fisted.

"classicsoncall","8","8","16","30 May 2017"," ""Yes, we can NOT do things.""
","I read about half of the sixty nine reviews already posted here for this film, and only two other writers mentioned what I thought was the main idea of this movie. It's a not so thinly veiled effort at memorializing real life General Stanley McChrystal, who's forced resignation as Commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan occurred because of a Rolling Stone article in which he criticized then Vice-President Biden. In the film, his stand-in, Brad Pitt as General Glen McMahon, expresses disillusionment over the short shrift given to his presence on the tarmac at the hands of President Obama, hastily boarding a plane to avoid speaking to a real, hands on warrior.<br/><br/>The film may be a parody in some respects, but what it does is put American military policy in the proper context of being victim to political overreach and oversight. All you have to do is think about McMahon's reaction to 'systemic negation of repetitive procedural practice' to get a hint of what this is all about. When warrior generals are eclipsed by political generals in deference to their civilian Commander-in-Chief, what you have is a recipe for conducting war with no intention of winning them.<br/><br/>Frankly, I'm surprised this film was even made because it's a terrible indictment of military policy under the prior administration. It may be true that ""You can't win the trust of a country by invading it"", but at the same time, you can't engender troop morale with a policy of 'courageous restraint'. When I first heard about that as an official policy for our troops engaged in the Middle East, it no longer surprised me that upper echelon personnel from our service branches began taking early retirement in droves. Fighting a war with both hands tied behind one's back is more likely to get one killed, and is a message frustratingly delivered by the conduct of troops on the ground in this film.<br/><br/>All in all, Brad Pitt is unerringly brilliant in his portrayal here, even with the mock quizzical look on his face most of the time, because he knows what the score is, and that the game is rigged against him. For his part, Ben Kingsley is hysterical as Afghan President Hamid Karzai, leading his country by not leading it. If ever there was a war film that defined the phrase 'Catch-22', this is it. Watch it for a brilliant demonstration of how military policy has been redefined so as 'not to do things'."

","I've watched a large number of war and military movies over the years and after spending 36 months at war myself, I'll say that from my experience there has never been a movie, series, or otherwise that has managed to capture ""war"" or the ""military"" in its entirety because individual experiences vary. I will say that occasionally, a movie or show comes around that captures one of the facets accurately. Unfortunately, the value or worth of a movie or show isn't based on capturing a facet of reality, it's based on ratings. It's based on theatrical engagement. And that's OK I guess, because I get that it's an industry. But for me, the value of this movie isn't the plot line or how over-the-top Pitt was in his character development, it's the fact that War Machine captures the relationship between the military and government officials in a very real way. I was in Iraq during this period of time, and the release of the ""Karzai 12"" in Afghanistan, and how it in turn affected our rules of engagement in Iraq, came flooding back to me as this movie progressed. I was incredibly angry at the situation, similar to Andy Moon's response (only with less Rambo flare). To that point, I was glad I took the time to watch it, if for nothing more than seeing that the story got told. This movie is a slightly better than mediocre movie with some powerful moments that I'll watch once and reference only for its ability to accurately capture this one facet of war."
"popnruss","9","8","16","27 May 2017"," A very good film!
","I really enjoyed this film simply because it took a very serious subject, poked at it a bit but without causing too much pain. It is a satirical account of the exploits of General McCrystal which eventually led to his removal as commander of the troops in Afghanistan with President Obama as commander-in-chief. Brad Pitt portrays General McMahon as a man willing to devote his life to the Army, and has done just that. He does an excellent job in the role. Anthony Michael Hall gives an over the top performance as a ranking member of McMahon's team. The supporting cast that make up the rest of the team are equally as convincing as McMahon's minions who are at his beck and call. Meg Tilly is very good as McMahon's wife of 30 years who points out to him that they have spent a total of 30 days together in 8 years. Talk about long suffering. McMahon is portrayed as a man with a sense of complete control yet bit by bit it is taken away."

","Even though Brad acts in a comical style doing a caricature of a general, almost everything this satire seeks to illuminate rings true. So this movie isn't an exaggerated satire but a very illuminating look at the impossible situation in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>There haven't been many movies critical of Obama's policy in the Middle East so it's quite surprising to see one on TV.<br/><br/>Brad acts well enough as the well intentioned but misguided general and the viewer feels his struggle to do what he thinks will make a difference despite all signs and advice that he will not succeed. The futility of the counter insurgency is so clearly portrayed.<br/><br/>With all the different conflicts going on in Iraq Syria Lybia etc it's hard to keep clear what the struggle in Afghanistan is about so it's quite illuminating to see the conflict and the policies in focus here. It's also refreshing to see a non battle centered war movie that shows broader policy errors instead of concentrating on the individual blood and guts stories."

"abeburnett","4","11","24","27 May 2017"," Another stinker from Netflix
","Man, what the heck are you doing, Netflix? I was willing to dismiss Handsome as a inevitable outlier--a lone turkey--but to follow up Handsome with this? It had so much going for it, but the script and pacing sucked. The overall premise sucked. I was super excited for this, based on the trailers, but what I saw was an enormous flop. It reeked of vanity project--and political grandstanding. As if the only point here was to beat us over the head, for two hours, with how pointless counter-insurgency tactics are. Okay, message received, but at the cost of the Netflix reputation. <br/><br/>It seemed, other than a meandering script, that the biggest problem with this film is its perspective: that of a Rolling Stone reporter (who doesn't enter the film, officially, beyond the capacity as a narrator, until the mid-way mark). It's littered with awkward and inconsistent narration by this narrator who only serves to remind us of how dumb Glen, and his counter- insurgency tactics, were. It's patronizing, and not at all humorous. In fact, I felt mostly just bad for Glen for much of the movie. He seemed like an underdog, a guy who genuinely wants to do the ""right thing"" but is just a little delusional. He's not a bad guy, just a disconnected one. <br/><br/>This film would've been far more successful if it had been a present-tense story, where we see things, not from the doomed memoir perspective, but from the perfect plan (well, not so perfect, as we see) unraveling perspective. If it had been played more from the Dumb and Dumber angle, where you can be in on the joke, rather than from a moralizing perspective. Yes, it's about war, and how absurd it seems modern war is when nation building is being attempted, but let the viewer draw their own conclusions--don't tell us how to think and feel about things. A truly intelligent approach to this same story would be to actually execute on the premise of a comedic war movie which is comedic because it's ridiculous. Period. And do so in a tight, well executed, non-moralistic way. Yes, the audience still would've come away realizing how counter-productive all these ""anti- insurgency"" efforts are, and they would've been entertained at the same time. Otherwise, you might've just made a (much cheaper) documentary. Granted, Netflix probably wouldn't have funded it to the same tune, and they probably wouldn't have rolled out the red carpet for its release. <br/><br/>But at this rate, I no longer believe that the Netflix brand, especially in self-produced movies, is an indicator of quality. Instead the Netflix brand in movies is becoming synonymous with disappointing movies. They're great at marketing them (the trailers are, without exception, engaging and have driven me to watch Handsome, and now, War Machine), but they're doing a really poor job making an actual decent movie. I'm not even asking for a ""great"" movie, I'd settle for a merely ""good"" movie. <br/><br/>This is just a travesty. It hurts watching Brad Pitt and many other great actors, meandering through this pompous, boring vanity piece. It had superb cinematography, and a good sound track, but that was about it. I guess the dialogue was pretty good, even though the overall script sucked (in terms of approach to the story, story arc, pacing, humor, etc). <br/><br/>It's a sad day when I have to push myself to even get to the 50% mark, and then start skipping ahead five minutes at a time just so I can get a sense for how it ends. And let me tell you, the ending? Zero humor. Great moral grandstanding, but zero entertainment value. See, the thing which is brilliant about most modern American media, is how it weaves left-wing values into entertaining content. There are a great many shows whose politics I don't agree with, but which I still enjoy and find entertaining. But this War Machine effort from Netflix is just ham handed, sloppy, and a waste of time. But that's just my feeling on it. <br/><br/>War Machine fails to either be an entertaining dramatic war movie, and it fails (with very rare) exception at comedy as well. At this point I seriously doubt I will trust Netflix's marketing of any future self-produced movies. As the saying goes, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on you. And there will not be a third time. I just feel offended and insulted and tricked. I trusted the Netflix brand, I trusted their marketing (trailers), and they let me down."

"alexandermangoldt","8","5","9","10 June 2017"," Good, clean anti-war movie
","I've been abstinent from IMDb for quite some time but just watching War machine and considering the bad ratings it has gotten so far gave me an impulse to write a review.<br/><br/>First off: This is a good movie. At the beginning of the movie Brad Pitt overdoes it a bit in his caricature of General McMahon and I was quite frankly expecting a few laughs in the following. But this film is not a full-fledged comedy and I don't think it was meant to be.<br/><br/>In the course of this film I got used to Brad Pitt's seemingly overdone gestures and postures and took them as genuine features of the General portrayed.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes which I really liked about the movie: The best moment to me was when Tilda Swinton in the role of a German journalist reveals by intelligent interrogation that General McMahon lives in his own world where battles and wars are either lost or won. She makes it clear to him and the rest of the world that wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan can never be won because they do not fit the pattern of wars such as WWII or WWI, with a clear cut enemy and clear front lines. She (Tilda Swinton aka German journalist) has understood what the Generals and the political leaders of the coalition forces have failed to grasp or do not want to grasp. She questions the general's sense of self and it seems that she is the first person that gets through to the General and incites him to question himself.<br/><br/>The one and only battle scene of the film was, in my humble opinion, done very well, too. You see a group of American soldiers in a deserted, strategically totally unimportant area fighting a battle against three Taliban snipers. In the fight, a young soldier manages to kill the snipers by an act of bravery but kills an innocent boy as well. The supposed hero turns home from battle as a broken man. That's in a nutshell what war does to any young man.<br/><br/>When Brad Pitt aka General McMahon flies in to tell the Afghan people what it is they are trying to do and wants to draw a bigger picture they all just kindly ask him to leave. He tries again to make them understand, but to no avail. Even the metaphorically used expression 'If you want to make an omelette you have to break some eggs' surprisingly fails to win the hearts and minds of the Afhhan people.<br/><br/>The only reason I can think of why this film is unsuccessful is because it is very critical of the American foreign policy/ military and Americans (that is my contention) in general don't like it if their army is ridiculed. Another reason might be that people expected battles scenes but as I've said, there is only one.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you want to understand how futile the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are, go see this film"

It's a response and a reminder to viewers or potential viewers of this film that it's prudent not to take the movie too seriously. Personally, anytime there's genuine and factual criticism against the government and the military it's worth the time to read, watch, or listen the narrative. One more thing. . .NETFLIX has created some rather epic movies over the years and the upper echelon that runs the show are not about to venture into a production that's branded silly, inane, or a waste of time.

","War Machine is a recent straight to Netflix film starring Brad Pitt. After several box office flops, the best and most obvious outcome for leading actor Brad Pitt is for Netflix services. War Machine appears to be based on true events and is described as a war comedy-drama. However, this film has a confusing tone and often settles on what it appears to wanting to be. It stands out not as a comedy as in the film isn't funny but is more light hearted in tone, and plays somewhat of a parody of a serious war film such as Lone Survivor or the Hurt Locker, then shifts towards a more darker toned drama film, with very few action scenes. Overall, War Machine was not worth the hype it has received, as the film is quite uninteresting (for a true based story) and is rather boring. The performances are quite decent, as Brad Pitt is able to play a different type of character than his typical characters.

","War Machine is amongst that special breed of movies that defy categorisation. <br/><br/>At times laugh out loud funny - at others devastatingly, gut-wrenchingly tense and moving. This film takes us on an interesting journey through the mind of a 21st century US General. Maybe he genuinely believes in the hopelessly futile mission he's inherited (""winning the hearts and mind of the people""). Certainly he's portrayed as a man nearing the end of a distinguished career, ever more desperate for that decisive battle that would guarantee his name passing into US military folk-lore alongside the likes of Lee and MacArthur.<br/><br/>He appears to be a humanitarian, seeking to minimise civilian casualties, but this could be purely because this is one of the key planks of his driving strategy – counter insurgency. Brilliantly played by Brad Pitt, and ably supported by a motley crew of assorted military aides, the General appears to display more disdain for politicians and his US ""allies"" than he does for the ""enemy"". The only reason he appears to be so supportive of the Afghan president, another amusing portrayal by the great Ben Kingsley, is that he is a key ally in the General's counterinsurgency strategy.<br/><br/>Yet the General's blinkered, one-track strategy, which only the most loyal of his followers appear to support, is not the most fascinating aspect of this movie. <br/><br/>The most incredible thing about this must-watch, ramshackle romp through the General's tenure as the top military man in Afghanistan, is that it is based on true events."

","A world conquering streaming provider putting up $60 million dollars of hard earned cash.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""War Machine"" (2017) was a very pleasant surprise for me. I kinda expected it to be ... i don't know what after seeing mixed critics reviews and kinda low score on IMDb. But this is a superbly involving, funny, smart movie in the best traditions of ""Wag the Dog"" (1997) and other good satire movies. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt absolutely kills it as Gen. Glen McMahon - this is a over the top performance which could be said (and is said by many) is a bad one, but i found it superb - exactly suited for a role - this one of the most interesting performances in his carrier in many moons. Supporting performances were solid and especially by Anthony Michael Hall. There are also some very well known faces made a cameos, all great ones. Script was smart, involving and sometimes very funny. Directing was solid - at running time 2 hours this movie never dragged and was involving from start till finish. <br/><br/>Overall, ""War Machine"" is a superb movie for those who like smart satires about war. It is surprisingly original movie the one which isn't predictable for a second. All in all this is a superb picture."
"eqxtra","9","5","10","28 May 2017"," Based on a true story?
","I have noticed that movies that claim to be based on a true story generally have very high IMDb scores. It seems that people are so tired of special effects and senseless action movies that they are seeking for some meaning, a morale, a spiritual journey or otherwise something more connected to real life. The problem I have with this is that most of the time people watch those movies like it's a documentary, not realizing that claiming it is based on a true story says nothing about the extent in which it is actually the case. It can be less than 1% On the other hand, this movie did not claim to be based on a true story, yet there is more truth to the realities of war than many of these movies claiming to be based on true events. We depend so much on media, and this media is so self-censored to not put off viewers or patriotism that the public simply does not get to see what happens on the ground. Clean war does not exist. There is nothing more civil about high-tech nukes than cutting heads off or suicide bombings. The end result is the same, just seems more appetizing when all they show on TV are the fumes of smoke rather than the body parts scattered all over the place.<br/><br/>Face it, the Iraq war was started based on lies of WMD, and as a result the middle east has been destabilized, set on fire and the fire has spread and eventually lead to ISIS. Were those who started the Iraqi war on false premises with hundreds of thousands of deaths as a result, ever brought to justice? What legitimacy do we have left to call ourselves the good guys if we can't even bring our own crimes against humanity to justice? How can democracy possibly work when media is failing to show truth? It's a farce. This movie does not even come close to showing the true ugliness of war and the industry that it is. After all, it was still supposed to be funny, and it was. But it was far more than that and for that I give 9/10.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: There were a lot of memorable moments in the movie, but the one I will remember is where the guy finds out that the grenade he had launched had killed the child. People are slaughtered like its a video game, and for what? Nothing is more absurd than the reality of war. And nothing is more ugly and anti-civil than war. No society making profit off of war van be considered civil, by definition. The bad guys are among us."

","This film revealed how the media, politics and politicians make it difficult for our military to win wars.<br/><br/>Obama, like Lyndon Johnson before him, was a micromanager. Both put insurmountable limitations above all else. All they cared about was perception. The military fights wars to win not to be politically correct. Political correctness should stay out of war or don't fight them.<br/><br/>In the movie Obama gave the enemy the Taliban the news they would pull out at the end of the surge. That was a cluster f**k. In reality his administration did that often. You can't win a war if you give the enemy your plans and Obama would do that time after time. <br/><br/>The character McMahon was well portrayed by Brad Pitt. McMahon was a warrior not a politician. His was a no win situation thanks to the Obama administration. The administration just wanted to pull out they never intended to win the war. <br/><br/>Westmoreland must've felt the same as McMahon when in Vietnam. Both McMahon and Westmoreland lost because the media and politicians were convinced the war was unwinnable. Thus making the war a three front war, the enemy on one front, the media in another front and the politicians being the third front. No general can win with those odds.<br/><br/>The character portrayed by Tilda Swinton was annoying and stupid. Her speech was just more political dribble best saved for her constituents certainly not for a military planning meeting."

","Brad Pitt's Netflix movie (loosely based on General McChrystal's Afghanistan experience) is a deadpan comedy about how stupid modern American wars are. Absolutely no one knows what the f@#k they're doing or why they're doing it, the goal of winning a counterinsurgency war is delusional and impossible to achieve. The locals hate us and wonder why the f@#k we came to their country. The soldiers don't have any answers either. Except for some really thick ones who get a hard on from wearing the uniform, drink the Koolaid & believe they're doing something important.

"laszlo-05700","5","3","5","22 June 2017"," Not awful, but it isn't going to be your movie of the year
","I never thought a war movie with Brad Pitt can go wrong. Well, it did. But let's start with the good things! War Machine is a unique movie. It is unique in storytelling, acting, viewpoint - which makes it a refreshing experience in the world of superhero movies. There are a few well-done scenes that will make you think about this whole damn thing in Afghanistan - which is probably what the creators wanted to achieve. A few could argue about whether they remained neutral in the topic, but there are signs showing that they tried - so no bad point there either.<br/><br/>On the other hand, just by taking the risk of being unique, they weren't able to translate this to winning aspects. I could find the fun in the ridiculous running of Brad Pitt, which is just like the original US Army general portrayed (I have a friend who runs just like that and still went for an army career, no idea why people with bad running technique have military-obsession). Even his gray hair and over-sized clothes made sense (although you could feel that they were a bit overdone even for satire). But why the heck did he had to alter his voice just for playing Glenn McMahon?! You don't do that at professional level, who thought it's going to work? He's goddamn Brad Pitt - if he fits the role, he can fit it even with his own voice! The rest of the cast remained a bit out of spotlight for the whole runtime and I'm not sure that introduction scene at the beginning was a good idea - it's too much information at once and the viewer will have no experience about the characters, just a few narrated sentences. It wouldn't be a problem if it's really a political movie, but as for being a strange crossover between political and war movie I don't think it worked.<br/><br/>I think Netflix tried to bite too big for a first big feature film. There are some points in the movie where you can see that they tried to save the situation, but overall I'd book War Machine as a failure."
"Gordon-11","Null","3","5","28 May 2017"," A satire
","This film tells the story of an ambitious army general, who is posted to Afghanistan to run the mission to fight insurgents. It becomes apparent very soon that various parties have not aligned their goals and missions.<br/><br/>""War Machine"" tells a story of an enthusiastic man who is stuck in a web of bureaucracies. The story unfolds slowly, and at times it looks like a satirical look at a system that is supposed to serve and protect the public. The cameos are plentiful, making me pleasantly surprised. Though I find the film a little uneventful, I can see that it parallels what exactly is happening in the story to the characters."
"foreverbleedingblue15","3","5","11","13 June 2017"," What did I just watch?
","Gosh, where to begin...I caught War Machine scrolling through Netflix on a day off and thought I'd give it a chance. Any movie with Brad Pitt can't be horrible right? Sadly, wrong. Perhaps horrible isn't the correct adjective. Painfully mediocre is more accurate.<br/><br/>This painfully mediocre film just simply doesn't know what it is. There are some semi-comedic scenes that prompted a chuckle or two. Was it supposed to be a drama about the war in Afghanistan? The country really only serves as a setting(minus one combat scene) and the many facets of the war there were seldom touched on. Instead you get Brad Pitt doing a VERY, VERY strange tough-guy/chain-smoker accent portraying a 4-Star General in the Army who has about as much personality as a wet blanket. I kept on wanting his character to morph into this cool, savvy, funny, leader...but it just never happened. The film's main focus, I think, was supposed to be about a writer from the Rolling Stone magazine exposing his unit as unfit. This was clear in how the film ended, but during the run-time of the movie, that sub-plot was about fifth down the line of sub-plots in terms of interest by this watcher. <br/><br/>Basically, there's a good movie buried somewhere deep in here. But what we got was a jumbled up mess that struggles to inform the viewer what the movie is really supposed to be about. It's a shame the producers could not compile such interesting topics and ideas into at least an average movie.<br/><br/>3/10"
"revboose-781-838014","4","5","11","7 June 2017"," Struggled to find the satire
","Having watched several movies calling themselves ""satire"" and others labelled ""black comedy"", I started watching War Machine expecting to find some. It wasn't easy. I'm still not sure I found any.<br/><br/>Consider that part of the satire of something like the Colbert Report was the over-the-top earnestness of the main character, believing in ludicrous things and having a sarcastic edge running through everything. Drowning Mona gets laughs and headshakes for, likewise, taking things to extremes. To keep it military, watch The Pentagon Wars as the Bradley Fighting Vehicle is procured. You laugh because things can't possibly be this stupid, and yet (to a point) they are.<br/><br/>War Machine has us watch Brad Pitt's General Glen McMahon nosedive from supreme confidence to confusion to anger to despair and, ultimately, sadness as he realizes that he's a warrior who has been given a war that he can't possibly win, no matter how many strings he pulls. He's a warrior, not a politician, not a diplomat, and not one who loses. And yet, loss is really all he has in his hands, right from the get-go. It's just. Not. Funny.<br/><br/>Pitt plays his caricature of a general very well, and he alone keeps the film moving. He rolls through the early parts of the film like a bestarred Popeye, wondering why people don't get what he feels should be instinctively understood. As we are told, he is a ""true believer"" whose understanding is that the reason others' attempts to do the same job has failed is because they weren't him. But with every roadblock, every question, and every gobbledeygook answer he has to give, that confidence cracks and breaks down. He lacks the ludicrousness of Colbert and the black nature of Drowning Mona, and never makes it over the top. <br/><br/>Pitt himself has said that the movie exposes the fallacy that ""everyone wants what America has"" and that American military efforts are really just aggressive exporting of American ideals. This may be true... but, again, it's not really that funny. For me, the biggest laugh is the final clip of the movie, when his successor is named and marches into frame, with the same eagerness and earnestness that Pitt's character has at the outset. ""Here we go again"" is unspoken, but understood."
"p-26739","10","5","11","31 May 2017"," The director and actors broadcast an important message!
","I was really shocked to read such a terrible criticism of this film. It's not entirely fair .... Yes, this movie has technical mistakes and its nuances. Because the director could not decide how to submit and present this film. And do we choose the drama itself whether it's a drama, a black comedy, a military satire? Why did the film not like American critics? Because it's not a famous Sniper? This film hit the vanity of many and policy figures and the US Army. In particular, even Barack Obama got it. Obama is an orator !. I always suspected that the war in Avganistan was meaningless. And nobody does not want to solve the problems of the wall.<br/><br/>This film is not bad, it's true! That's why critics began to throw Brad Pitt tomatoes, thereby demonstrating how they defend the honor of their country, and do not give the truthful films a chance. This is a loud directing statement, although I have many claims to Michaud about the technique. Some will say that Brad Pitt played horribly, a cartoon, etc. But you are so wrong in it, he never had such a role ... He played nice, Brad was everywhere together, and in satire And in black comedy and drama He everywhere reincarnated, because he himself was not sure what genre this film belongs to. General Pitt - this is something new, the ubiquitous nature of the game ... All the other actors were also good, especially want to mention the role of women (fine) War Machine is not a failure, it's the way to something new! Michaud and Pitt made a very brave film, because of this and suffered, unfortunately ... ... The one who wanted this and heard the messages that were directed by the director and actors to ordinary people and not only ... Often Brad Pitt's films outperform Their time. And War Machine is one of them. In the world, in cinema and politics, a sharp turn is moving that a tremendous change and Brad Pitt are part of this mechanism. All my faith in this film.

In this movie, Pitt portrays the newly hired general, with unusual and distinctive mannerisms, as he tries to turn the tide of the war and claim a victory.

I feel like it was a pointed, clear message about our presence there, but that many of us were perhaps expecting another Fury or Inglorious Basterds. Others have spoken about all the characters in the movie, so I won't add anything, but I'm amazed to see that no one has once mentioned Meg Tilly as Gen. Glenn McMahon's wife. I haven't seen Meg act in anything in ages, but this was a terrific and nuanced performance. Male soldiers with fewer lines and less screen time have merited call outs, but really, Meg Tilley was amazing, just as amazing as the wonderful Tilda Swinton or Ben Kingsley. Her eyes never left Brad Pitt, and you could just imagine what their thirty years of marriage must have been like. Her subtle gestures and half-spoken words created a picture of 30 years of unwavering loyalty and devotion to a man she adores and respects, but her face shows how much those often lonely years cost. When she said her final line of, ""I'm proud of me too."", I found it thrilling. I hope we see more of her in the future, because she was definitely one of astonishing bright points in this movie."

","Admittedly I think Brad Pitt's character roles can border on brilliant (Burn After Reading, Inglourious Basterds) or self important. So what happens when he plays a self important general? <br/><br/>War Machine takes a look at the war in Afghanistan with a twisted perspective we can only hope is a farce. But as you watch and consider what we hear and think of other General-In-Charge films (Patton) it becomes all too real. Brilliant writing might go unnoticed by many and the deadpan play of characters hell bent to serve a purpose in the absurdity of the world of politicians running wars. Pitt's general sums it up, ""we must avoid killing at all cost. We can't help them and kill them at the same time.""<br/><br/>Like the war which has meandered over the years, the movie gets lost along the way. The film does well showing desperation of people caught in situations they can't control, the war and political opinion, and situations we think we can control, but can't. Illustrated by the awkwardness of the general's marriage. Meg Tilley, as the general's wife, brilliantly underplays the absurdity and desperation of a marriage where the betrothed see each other 30 days a year. <br/><br/>Bear through it, as they must, to get to the last act of the film. It is worth it. The narrator sums up how we all feel at the end. But I won't tell you here, put on you're snarky attitude and watch."

","From the previews I thought it was going to be a dark comedy, a satire or something in that vein, and that's kind of how it started. Then the script was getting more serious and the other characters were acting more serious, yet Brad Pitt's character was still in satire mode, if you call it that. I don't think his one eye unsquinted the whole movie.
It dealt with some very controversial issues, some of which I didn't agree with how they portrayed it. The war in Afghanistan (operation freedom) was started after WE were attacked on 9/11. It's interesting how quickly people forget.. since my father was at the tower I guess I didnt. After 9/11 patriotism was at its highest since WW2 and many people were signing up to fight against the terrorism so that something like that would not happen again. Yet the narrator who sounded like he was narrating a children's book, made it sound like we went there just to invade the Afghans so of course they were pissed because we were pushing our ideals on them. Yes that I'm sure did happen but that was not why we were there. It also touched on the politics behind war and how decisions are made for political reasons and not in best interest of the soldiers etc.. I agreed with that but again the delivery was confusing , I wasn't sure if I was suppose to laugh or not.
Anyway, I was willing to put my political views aside if it was funny and light hearted but once it started getting serious (like showing a dead kid killed by a young scarred marine) it lost me, was that supposed to be funny?! It started feeling more like a blow to the soldiers rather then a satire. Obviously the film had an agenda. Either way it was executed poorly. I just don't get what they were trying to go for.. maybe a new type of film genre ? Well it sucked IMO"

The narration from POV of a tailing journalist seems distant and poorly fitting written in such a manner it completely opposes the rest of the film and sits out as a poor element of this entire runtime.

Now if only the movie was good.<br/><br/>War Machine tells the modest rise and tragic fall of General Glen McMahon (Pitt); an ambitious an foolhardy Army functionary who is given the insurmountable task of ending the War in Afghanistan. To accomplish this, McMahon assumes, quite incorrectly, that the sheer willpower of the world's most powerful Army, and the flaccid abilities of his tight-knit entourage will be enough to bolster the impossible (a successful counterinsurgency). Unfortunately for the General, nothing is truly fair in love and war. He bristles uncomfortably under the confines of coalition bureaucracy and civilian middle management while slowly coming to believe he's entitled to so much more.<br/><br/>War Machine wants to be two things at once and somehow manages to be neither. It wants to be a sharp-witted black comedy a la In the Loop (2009), while still being a somewhat nuanced character piece about an Army lifer whose hubris is mismatched by the times. Standing in the way in both cases is Brad Pitt's performance who stands apart from the film in its own little orbit. It's an entertaining performance that conjures memories of George C. Scott's Patton (1970) and Thierry Lhermitte's performance in The French Minister (2013). Yet there's nothing really tethering him to the rest of the film. When it plays for the laughs - Pitt goes introspective. When the film goes gonzo - Pitt turns into a caricature.<br/><br/>Additionally the humor never feels like it's reaching the absurd heights it should; though part of that may just be the sign of the times. The film is based on ""The Operators"" by Michael Hastings, which itself is based on the firing of Army General Stanley McChrystal. With that in mind, its easy to see why the movie's tone is measured, assured and some may say boring, while broad comedic set-pieces are nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>Yet while the tone is boring and provides only toothless satire, the pacing is all over the place. One minute we're knee-deep in a weaksauce version of House of Cards (2013-Present), the next minute we're in a frantic Sgt. Bilko (1996) routine with the most torpid ensemble in recent memory. For what it's worth, Anthony Michael Hall, Topher Grace, RJ Cyler et al. seem to be going for nuance as McMahon's entourage of dog robbers yet the editing guarantees that you'll get nothing more out of the characters outside of Scoot McNairy's piddly narration. What draws more attention and arguably more ire are the actors who play real people; namely Ben Kingsley as an ineffectual President Karzai and Reggie Brown who plays President Obama like Wilson from Home Improvement (1991-1999). Their inclusion stops just short of making the entire ordeal look like a failed TV pilot.<br/><br/>War Machine ultimately feels like a ""Beetle Bailey"" comic strip without a punchline. The satire is impoverished, the pacing is all over the place and Brad Pitt's, conceited and glib performance leaves little room for anything else to take root. Deadpan - more like dead in the water."

","For movies whose screenplay is supposed to be relevant (which are... all of them except the trashiest of entertainment) dubbing can be as damaging to the original as a tone-deaf song cover. In Italy (and in most central-southern Europe) since the dawn of commercial cinema distributors have developed a very capable dubbing industry: unfortunately I find that this ""art"" a lot of times does ruin the original. Why don't we have Mozart's requiem in Japanese? Isn't there a relevant market for classical music? Of course any music student is having shivers down his spine at the idea... because it's a stupid idea. But well... some had this idea 70 years ago and apparently none felt like it was worth to change things since.<br/><br/>As I doubt producers do care with what their paying customers do, I believe writers, directors and actors should require that their works will not be dubbed. But possibly they don't care either... And this tells a lot about the average education of these categories...<br/><br/>Anyway, in a movie like this one it's hard to pass on some stupid writing: we are talking about war, about international politics and about our world. And while we are used to listen to any possible position on the news or on the internet it's hardly bearable for me to see certain extreme levels of unintentional idiocy in a movie. To my sensitivity some phrases felt as ""smart & funny"" as laughing at people with handicaps. Whatever... I account this to an unprofessional translation and actually the movie improved a lot after the first 10-20 minutes (that's where I had a hard time with the script: did they switch translator later?). What I felt insulting slowly became surreal, sarcastic and grotesque: in a good and almost sophisticated way I'd say.<br/><br/>To the actual movie now:<br/><br/>This is the story of how a decorated general accepts the ""publicly accepted"" tasks of winning a war against terror, not losing resources, disengage conflicts and earn civil trust in modern day Afganistan.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is the lead and is out of his depth imho: I can't simply believe for 1 second that he is a (dumb) 60 something modern-day successful military. Nonetheless he tries hard enough for me to forget about this and pretend he's what he's supposed to be. The budget (except the one for actors I guess) feels basic in terms of production but photography, scenes and costumes are as good as needed (where did they spend 60M $? Are military equipment scenes that expensive?).<br/><br/>While not a great accomplishment ""War machine"" shows well some things and does so without any docu feel or paternalistic ""I know it better"" tone:<br/><br/>The uncoordinated (and ultimately pointless) endeavors of international politics;<br/><br/>The inability (or impossibility?) of the military to adapt to a world that functions with principles different than ""strenght"" and ""order"";<br/><br/>The media/cultural machine as an entity much more powerful (and yet harder to control) in determining ""things"" than any actual political initiative;<br/><br/>The egoistic perspective of American (and worldwide) business, bureaucracy, military when coping with conflicts of interest possibly influencing YOUR OWN career;<br/><br/>The reputation of powerful men as pure propaganda to instill trust and maintain control: real men are actually less capable and ultimately less powerful than we're led to believe."

The charecters are not beliveable and its seems the film makers are trying to make a political point but totaly skipping any historical facts.It seems the post production didnt do much research and had not much knowledge of the afgan war.
For example there is one seen when nato generals are have a meeting about the general situation of the afgan war, one british general recommends leaving helmand province as its a lost cause, This just simply didnt happen in fact it was both the US and UK forces agreed on expanding in the area with more US troops being stationed in Helmand.

","This movie is far from perfect but the good points outweigh the bad. The acting is good all around. Ben Kingsley as Karzai was particularly good.

For me the biggest problem is that the filmmakers didn't know who should be the target of the satire. In the end I think they settled on the general and his entourage but they also didn't want to make their star appear too unsympathetic so the satire is VERY light. The politicians mostly get a free pass too. Obama could use some criticism for his handling of foreign policy but he's off limits for the most part."

"sddavis63","9","2","4","22 August 2018"," A Reflection On A Futile And Pointless But Costly War
","It's hard to know how to characterize this movie. Is it a comedy? A dark comedy? A satire? A war movie? Some combination or permutation of any combination of those and more? But whatever it is - I liked it! I thought it was a very well done spin on what really is the absolutely futile US war in Afghanistan - a country that never actually attacked the United States and a country that no empire (not the British, not the Soviet and not the American) has ever been able to conquer. It revolves around the character of Gen. Glen McMahon - known as ""The Glenimal."" He's a well known, high powered General who supposedly had great success in Iraq (?) using his strategy of SNORPP - ""Systemic Negation Of Repetitive Procedural Practice."" So they try to reproduce his strategy in Afghanistan - with no results. McMahon (played well by Brad Pitt) runs up against US troops who don't want to be there and who have no real idea why they're there or what they're supposed to do, Afghan troops who are lazy, drug addicted and completely uncommitted, allies who aren't willing to do much of anything - countries who've committed no more than a handful of soldiers, and then McMahon's visit to Europe - where France commits more troops (as long as they're not there for very long) and where Germany sends more troops (but won't allow them to leave the base.) Ben Kingsley offers a sadly accurate (in a satirical sort of way) portrayal of Afghan President Hamid Kharzai - who seems uninterested in anything at all. Karzai has a sort of ""just let the Americans do it and leave me out of it"" approach, but also shows that he gets the reality of the situation early on when, in a meeting with McMahon where the General details his ""new direction,"" Karzai responds, ""Sounds a lot like the old direction."" And there's mutual contempt between American military and civilian leaders, up to and including the Obama White House. BINGO!<br/><br/>But for all that, the movie - through McMahon's strategy - makes some valid points. McMahon seems to understand that the reason you have insurgents is because you've invaded somebody else's country. And that you don't win wars by killing civilians. When you do that you only make more insurgents - thus, his mathematical formula for insurgency: if you have 10 insurgents and you kill 2, you don't have 8 insurgents, you have 20 because all the friends and relatives of the insurgents you killed become insurgents in response. In the end what was left was an increasing number of insurgents, an international coalition that just wanted out of this hell hole, centred on American troops who had no idea what they were supposed to do in this hell hole, led by an American General who understood some of the realities of this hell hole but couldn't stop the cycle.<br/><br/>I suppose in the end that's the over-arching message of the movie: this is a cycle. Commanding Generals come and go, and each new General replacing a predecessor who failed to get it done as the guy who going to get it done, but he doesn't and ends up replaced by a new General who's going to get it done - and so on, and so forth, ad infinitum. It's told mostly as a reflection on a Rolling Stone article - the writer narrates some of the story, and the balance of the story is about the reaction to the article, which offers details of some of the unflattering thoughts of McMahon and his entourage toward the US administration.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. It's based on a book detailing the story of General Stanley McChrystal, who was appointed to the command in Afghanistan by President Obama. I thought it might have been just a little bit too long. The basic point (why does the US seem to be constantly at war and why does the US keep fighting wars that it can't win) could have been made more succinctly perhaps - but I'd call this a hard-hitting and pretty biting satire, that works - as does any good satire - on the basis that it's pretty much totally believable.

","Is this a comedy, a drama, a war film??? To be honest, I'm not really sure. Should we laugh, smirk, be angry, take it seriously? Again, don't know. War Machine seems to walk a tightrope between the aforementioned three genres while through its entirety, the film's identity is completely muddled which in turn leaves the viewer with the difficult task of interpreting what exactly they are watching and how exactly they should in turn feel. With that, there are many positive and negative aspects to War Machine...
1. War Machine gives us a credible, yet simplistic, critique of American neo-conservative foreign policy. Why exactly are we in Afghanistan? What is our goal? What are we accomplishing there? Is there a valid strategy to accomplish the goal? According to War Machine, that answer is ""no."" To think that as Americans we can take suburban Des Moines and simply drop it into the middle of Afghanistan, Iraq, or anyplace in the world with possesses oppressive dictatorial regimes without considering the engrained cultural and religious dogmas which exist in the population of our potential adversaries is both naive and idiotic. Do the Afghanis want what we have in the West??? Maybe some of them do but as a whole, the answer is no they don't. War Machine conveys this message quite aptly.
2. The script is well written and superbly acted by Brad Pitt as Gen. McMahon. His gruff voice, annoyed facial expressions, demanding demeanor, and unusual running style of keeping his arms at his side make him perfectly believable as a broken in career military veteran tasked with winning a seemingly unwinnable conflict.

If you are still blaming Obama for these nightmares then you are a complete idiot or an amnesiac.<br/><br/>It isn't a very cinematic depiction of war but it could be the most realistic telling of how wars are fought that has ever been put on film. Of course, I'm not including documentaries and this would have been much better as a documentary.

Our military leaders are blind half-wit unable to learn from their many, many mistakes over the past 70 years and almost every move they have made has been a mistake.<br/><br/>McCrystal was exactly the delusional creep that the reporter in the film calls out: ""As an elected representative of the people of Germany it is my job to ensure that the personal ambitions of those who serve those people are kept in check. You have devoted your entire life, General, to the fighting of war and this situation in Afghanistan, for you, it is the culmination of all your years of training, all your years of ambition. This is the great moment of your life.<br/><br/>It's understandable to me that you should have, therefore, a fetish for completion to make your moment glorious. It is my job, however, to ensure that your personal ambitions are not entirely delusional and do not carry with them an unacceptable cost for everybody else."" <br/><br/>Just what did our military elite think would be the result of our invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq? They couldn't give a straight answer to the American public and the Bush administration tip-toed around anything that hinted at predictions. They ridiculed reporters who asked them for predictions. Isn't a lack of predictions evidence of a lack of a plan?<br/><br/>So instead of any coherent strategy they gave us platitudes about facing evil. In the film before the General's big plan we get a rousing and moronic locker room speech reminiscent of Henry V and then a chaplain gives an even more moronic and insipid prayer.<br/><br/>(Perhaps you should begin by rereading the Rolling Stone article that shanghaied the career of the general.

Public support for the war has fallen substantially and previous efforts to clean up Afghanistan by other military generals have been mixed to shoddy. They decide to bring in some new blood and the new commander of the forces Gen. Glen McMahon (Brad Pitt). He's coming off of a successful campaign in Iraq implementing his SNORP principles (the movie doesn't give a detailed explanation but it's alluded to effective resource management and better communication). McMahon genuinely means well and he isn't short on confidence but he doesn't understand the situation he's being placed in. The administration isn't putting him there to win, he's there to minimize collateral damage and clean up the mess. McMahon seems oblivious to this and continues on like he's there to win. Whether this is good or bad, we'll find out.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, it's hard to nail down the tone of the movie. War Machine doesn't have any problem poking fun at how the War in Afghanistan was handled but the movie tries to be funny and yet show the difficulty coalition forces had in trying to secure the area. The narration provides some helpful information and really details how this kind of invasion rarely if ever works. I think War Machine manages to elicit some quality laughs and provide a different take in looking back at the war in Afghanistan but it doesn't always gel evenly. If you look at director David Michod comments about making a schizophrenic movie, it provides a little context to the tonal inconsistency.<br/><br/>Being a dark comedy about this subject, War Machine puts their opinions about the Afghanistan conflict front and centre. It was surprisingly critical of the Obama administration and I was fine with that. But they're take is a little controversial and that's probably contributed to the negative reviews. I liked the fact that they weren't afraid to be critical or to point out some of the ridiculous situations the soldiers were put in. But the movie glosses over any positive effects that the mission might have had. I mean it couldn't have been a unmitigated disaster. I get that this isn't a documentary but I wish they could have at least shown a peek at the other side of the issue.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performances seems to be pretty polarizing and I'll admit his performance makes General McMahon seem a little divorced from reality. He's based on real life General McChrystal who was in charge of operations for the U.S. forces in 2010. He was taken down by a Rolling Stone piece that openly showed him criticizing the Obama administration's handling of the situation. I thought he was really funny even if he could have been a little more realistic and he added a lot of small eccentricities to Gen. Glen McMahon that made him interesting to follow. The supporting cast is pretty impressive and I wish some of them had got some more time. Ben Kingsley was great as President Karzai but he's only in a couple of scenes. Tilda Swinton stole the show in her one scene. You have a lot of good actors in supporting roles; Alan Ruck, Daniel Betts and John Margaro come to mind. I also really liked Anthony Michael Hall in his role as Greg Pulver who basically is McMahon's angry #2 officer.<br/><br/>As much as the first act of the movie dips its toes into goofy comedy, the ending of War Machine really brings things to an end on a sombre note. It really drives home the distinct and defeatist nature of what the Afghanistan conflict turned into. The small action scene is intense and the fallout is heartbreaking. I don't always like sad endings but it fit this movie and it was definitely appropriate.<br/><br/>My dad was a big fan of M*A*S*H and while I didn't connect with the show like he did, I had a ton of respect for it. To provide a critical commentary on a real conflict on mainstream T.V. just isn't done and we could use more programming like that. War Machine doesn't have the same bite but the movie does provide some interesting commentary in retrospect. This movie doesn't have perfect balance but between the funnier bits and how they accurately portray the monotony and confusing nature of the Afghanistan conflict, I think they got the job done. War Machine is far from perfect but it has plenty of good moments and as long as your open to a different viewpoint on this war, you could find something stimulating in this."

","When I started to watch I couldn't figure out the movie. Was it serious with a really bad actor playing the lead? Was it a spoof, with an even worse portrayal of the General? I read another review which explained it as a take off on the General Mc Crystal thing, and that helped me figure it out, but it didm't make it any more entertaining.
Brad Pitt does a horrible version of a gravely voiced general, it just sounds super fake. I didn't even recognize him with his George Peppard look . The only thing convincing is when he puts on the ""stupid face""....hummmmm...well, the rest of the actors are actually not bad, which makes Pitts horrid performance stand out in sharp relief.
A good spoof gives you a good combination of belly laughs, mixed with a sort of feel good natured look at those we usually fawn over in a make fun of sort of way. In this film it doesn't work at all. it's like watching a porno film with no women and no sex, which leaves nothing, actually. This role shouldn't have been a stretch for the actor, I'm suprised it came out so bad."

","Netflix-produced two-hour satire about the U.S. general (Brad Pitt) sent to Afghanistan to 'clean' the situation up after eight years of war in the country. Nobody around him thinks they can win"" anymore, but this is the mission he takes for himself. Also playing Anthony Michael Hall, John Magaro, Topher Grace, Aymen Hamdouchi, Ben Kingsley, Tilda Swinton, Scoot McNairy et al. It's witty at times but often feels more like a overlong political comedy sketch than a proper movie, especially in the first half where voice-over tends to dominate proper"" storytelling. War Machine"" centres on Brad Pitt's character but this one-man-show won't probably charm many of his fans. I don't think the man has ever done less acting on screen, channeling Gen. Turgidson from Dr. Strangelove"" or whatever big-name high-ranking military official pops to your mind while watching. Pitt's one-note performance relies mostly one one or two facial impression which would be OK for Saturday Night Live"" skit or something, but it's nowhere near enough for a character carrying a two-hour movie. Based on book by Michael Hastings, written and directed by David Michôd who has shown promise with his earlier work, writing and directing crime dramas ""Animal Kingdom"" and ""The Rover"" plus co- writing 2010's cult comedy ""Hesher"". I would say ""War Machine"" will not be remembered as his great great follow-up project, but it's also true that I care little about political movies. In this case, the other critics seem to not care much, either. Metacritic's score is 56/100, Rotten Tomatoes's is 53/100. The main problem is that at 122 minutes, it's way too long. Half of that would have been enough. Making it through feels like a chore, not like a biting satire about war."
"YouthMisspent","2","2","5","31 July 2017"," Sattre doesn't mean dumbed down constant explanation
","Not so much deadpan but dead. Its nice that some directors in the US thought they should try and launch a ""self deprecating movie of American society and foreign policy"" - the caveat of course being that the actors and directors are not including themselves as subjects of deprecation. I suspect the target audience for this film is the kind who might vote for the kind of president who replaced Barrack Obama, except they're probably the least likely to watch anything they think might be critical of their perceived sense of righteousness. With this in mind, the film overly and excessively labors the point, so much so that it forgets it's satirical intentions, insulting the intelligence of anybody watching it who might already be aware of the foolishness of US foreign policy not just since the war in Afghanistan, but for the past 70 years at least (probably not the place to go into it) catch 22 is a far better place to start. As Winston Churchill himself once said ""you can count on Americans doing the right thing... Having exhausted every other possibility first"". The icing on the cake was in the press scene in Germany, where it seems to need to spell out the point several times that it is almost ridiculing the viewer - my partner and I were screaming yes we know... we don't need to be reminded constantly. Team America with it's crude simplistic style looks like a work of genius in comparison."

It was like watching a train crash in extreme slow motion. The very front collides first, but the steam continues to pour out and the pistons keep pumping as if nothing is wrong until eventually, the shock reaches the rest of the engine and everything disintegrates.<br/><br/>Overall, if you think you'd enjoy watching some top notch actors go out and have fun playing interesting if not exactly well fleshed out characters I recommend this movie."

","Official reviews, like The Guardian's, generally have a theme of this film as one that ""plays for laughs and misses the mark."" I disagree with that entirely, and think many of the reviewers themselves have in fact missed the mark.<br/><br/>This is not intended as a comedy (though there are occasional comic parts), nor as an action-war movie (though the one action scene in Helmand Province is actually quite involving). In my opinion, War Machine is an educational satire, going in-depth to show the futility and intolerable complexity of this paradox of a 'war'.<br/><br/>Yes, the general anti-war, left-leaning message may seem inevitable and obvious to some viewers. However, it is the rich content and characters of the film which provide wide coverage as to the different aspects of the unwinnable War in Afghanistan: the sulky Cpl. Billy Cole (Lakeith Stanfield) who's confused about whether to kill insurgents or show 'courageous restraint'; Afghan President Hamid Karzai (Ben Kingsley) who wonders whether the appointment of the new General McMahon (Brad Pitt in the lead role) is any different to the last general (hint: not really); McMahon trying to manage loads of different countries with varying involvement and limited communication, while scrounging for more troops around an increasingly sceptical Europe; and the fact that the US president himself does not truly believe the war can be won.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does a good job at portraying the hapless McMahon, mixing eccentric leadership with good intentions yet never fully grasping the reality of the situation. He's not a total idiot - in fact he's intelligent - but is doomed to fail.<br/><br/>I think this is a must-see from an educational perspective and provides more insight into this conflict (and conflicts in general) than in the vast majority of other movies out there. Don't be put off by the reviewers, they just didn't get it."

","With a similar tone to films like Lord of War, Wolf of Wall St and the Big Short, War Machine can only really be appreciated by those who like enjoy their narrative messages delivered clinically dry. Though the story is centred around the final push of a somewhat egotistical US general (played by Pitt) it's commentary stretches further into criticism of the entire Western establishment and managerial class.<br/><br/>There is a single line in the film referencing the fall of Rome and other more recent Empires. I think history will judge this film as being an interesting internal reflection on the collapse of the US Empire as it was happening - it is somewhat ahead of it's time.<br/><br/>Particularly poignant is the Marine who can't reconcile fighting an enemy you get medals to avoid killing, made all the more impactful by the issue that neither his sergeant nor his general can provide him with anything more than managerial catchphrases. This is how the world is organised now, around the Dunning-Kruger effect, as War Machine shows.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the script tight enough and the dialogue snappy - there is a lot to enjoy about War Machine - just don't expect to feel positive about the state of the world at the end.

Not really 'humorous' bit certainly light, though for me it just made it that much better because in our minds we know that these soldiers and the civilians went through a difficult and confusing time. Having been friends with a special forces Pathfinder serving there, it drew on the real problems they faced, but it informa and doesn't milk the audience for cheap emotional responses.

And while that seems to have a lot that a movie can exploit, watching it you can't help yourself but think, this would have been better served as a sketch or a short movie. While it still boasts a lot of star power (Brad Pitt is the lead but many more show up), the running time of 2 hours plus is way too long.

"svikasha","8","1","2","21 June 2017"," Hollywood's Late but Necessary Reply to America's Prolonged Engagement in Afghanistan
","""War Machine"" is a 2017 satirical war film that was released by Netflix in the spring of 2017. It is a fictionalized account loosely based on the story of General Stanley McChrystal. Although Hollywood has made many films depicting American forces in Iraq, very few films have been produced about the American war effort in Afghanistan. This fact is more astonishing when one considers that the War in Afghanistan is officially recognized as the longest military engagement in American history. Hollywood's silence in response to this prolonged and complex conflict is deafening. Fortunately, ""War Machine"" serves as Hollywood's fitting but late reply to America's protracted and seemingly never ending conflict in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Although ""War Machine"" does have an intriguing plot, even before the movie begins the film brings a lot of star power to the screen. Through the duration of the film, Topher Grace from ""That 70's Show"", Brad Pitt, Ben Kingsley, and Russell Crowe all make an appearance on screen. Brad Pitt plays a four-star General named Glen McMahon who is appointed by an out of touch American president to take over and bring an end to the War in Afghanistan. At the opening of the film, the War in Afghanistan had been going on for over a decade. General McMahon takes charge of the situation and decides to aggressively pursue an ill-advised military campaign to retake the desolate Helmand province of the country. Although General McMahon is clearly committed to his men, his country, and his leadership role, he is poorly equipped to take on the daunting task of taming Afghanistan. <br/><br/>General McMahon doesn't understand Afghanistan. Elections and democracy are foreign concepts to the Afghani people. The greatest scenes of the film depict the interactions between the bewildered General McMahon and President Hamid Karzai. Former Oscar Nominee Ben Kingsley brings his star power to the film in the role of the Afghani politician. Their humorous back and forth sheds some light on the true nature of the political reality of the government of Afghanistan. As the film continues, it becomes painfully obvious that Hamid Karzai is simply a figure head for a puppet state propped up by American military power. The actors truly do justice to the quagmire of the situation. As can be expected, despite the best of intentions, General McMahon fails to bring the Afghanistan conflict to a close. Like his predecessor, he is replaced by a new general. The cycle goes on. <br/><br/>The grim nature of the content of the film is probably why the movie received such mixed reviews by audiences. A lot of the sharp wit that is an integral part of the whole tone of the film may go over people's heads. Others will simply find the material offensive. But the harsh criticism that this film received by critics and audiences is undeserved. This movie needed to be made. The War in Afghanistan has gone on for too long for it to be ignored. <br/><br/>At the time ""War Machine"" was released, America's War in Afghanistan had lasted for nearly two decades. This war has cost the United States and its allies billions of dollars and thousands of lives. But the most painful truth about this war is that there is very little to show for the tremendous sacrifice that has been given. The only option the world seems to have when confronted with such a high sunk cost seems to be to keep trying. Fire the current general and send in another general. Maybe the next one will get it right."

","I came across this movie on Netflix streaming, loosely based on a real Army General. It is done in mostly a serious style but also with some parody elements. <br/><br/>The theme is that big countries, the USA in this story, easily take on the role as savior of other countries, believing they can go in, full battle uniform and weapons, and bring peace to an area that is in the midst of an often long-running war. Hubris.<br/><br/>The main character here is Brad Pitt as Gen. Glen McMahon, West Point graduate, highly intelligent, and just off dealing with issues in Iraq. Glen is guilty himself of hubris. He thinks his organizational skills and determination will ""win the war"" in Afghanistan. He is brought in, as the movie starts, to replace the general who failed to get it done.<br/><br/>His main right-hand man is burly Anthony Michael Hall as General Greg Pulver. His main task seems to be to keep reassuring McMahon that he is great, he is on the right track, perseverance will get it done.<br/><br/>Overall it is a tragic tale, it seems to mostly be pointing to the folly of thinking that a country can address the centuries old attitudes and practices and bring a democracy to what appears to be a heathen nation. <br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone but I am glad I took the time, it has to make one think.

Its main focus is on US command struggles (Brad Pitt and his crew) to apply their own counter-insurgence strategy inspite of reluctance from other parties and against all odds in a country which simply waits for the invaders to leave its premises as they all know it will happen sooner or later. <br/><br/>In order to show the tragedy of it all Netflix provides us with a superb spot-on dark comedy, which I found really amusing in many parts (cotton growing, certain jogging scene, all scenes with the participation of Afghan president to just name a few) but also with incisive critics of self belief demonstrated by ""our"" general and generals who'd follow (I guess he is just one of the many) that exactly he is the one who would win a war which is supposed not to be won, in order to realize his over ambition.<br/><br/>I give it a 10 despite some evident flaws because it is highly!!! underrated. If you want to watch it simply to see some spectacular war scenes - don't, there are none. And rightly so."

","I really liked this movie and Brad Pitt's portrayal especially. I would recommend it to anyone. :) I felt it was very authentic and reflected the complications and contradictions of modern warfare. A strong cast, including Topher Grace, Anthony Michael Hall, Alan Ruck, Ben Kingsley, Meg Tilley and Scoot McNairy round out the impressive ensemble and help this satire land its blows."

","Totally fabulous portrayal of how warfare's machine men clap each other on the backs to feed their egoes & further their careers. A merciless black comedy that gels with real life experiences of military persona."

","A movie like a documentary. A fluent story of a us general. Nice performance from actors, kind of fun. A little bit deeper inside story of US failure in Afghanistan."
"someguymarcus","4","1","4","6 October 2017"," 2 hours that were not worth it
","With such a great cast, I expected a great movie. Well, have I been wrong.<br/><br/>The movie concept was unique, that's for sure. Following a general during operations in Afghanistan could make for a great movie, if properly performed. Unfortunately, War Machine failed to do so. Little to no emotion was used. Every single one of the characters had a very, very curious personality, turning the movie into a freak show right away. At the 5-minute mark I assumed the movie to be a comedy. Yet, after not seeing a single comical seen for thirty minutes, I was confused as to what the purpose of the movie was. For a movie about a war, there was little to no action. General McMaho is portrayed as a quirky, freaky type of person, while at the same time acting as a true hero. It was obvious that the director wanted the viewer to have some mixed feelings, but what he got are confused ones.<br/><br/>In short| A waste of budget, of talent and of my time."
"TopDawgCritic","7","1","4","13 July 2017"," Not my cup of tea.
","I'm a fan of war-type films. And this isn't Brad Pitt's first rodeo in the genre. However, it's his worst. I realize he was trying to play the actual real-life general portrayed in this film, but I also know this film was far from the real actual events. And thus all I can remember after seeing this film, is Brad Pitt's character and that dumb jogging style he had. This is a miss from me, and thus only a 7/10"
"bestdesigns","8","1","4","11 June 2017"," Good plot shows reality but bad acting.
","Yess the movie is not upto expectation. But i am rating this movie 8 just because i like the plot. This movie kind of shows the truth on ground. Recently war is glorified too much. And American have their own version of war. But war is worst thing. The only solution to any problem is through peaceful negotiation. <br/><br/>This movie showed the ground realities of Afghanistan. how American Gov and army is working there and how Local gov is failing to prove anything. i hope people learn from this movie.<br/><br/>Watch this movie with open mind.Main point this movie tries to prove is you cannot build a nation on gunpoint. p.s acting is not good by bradpit :/"
"MovieHoliks","6","1","5","5 June 2017"," Pitt's Performance Was My Only Issue...
","I saw this new Netflix original movie the other night. This is a dark comedy/true story war picture which is set during the Obama era US occupation of Iraq, and overall it's a decent movie. Brad Pitt stars as the guy who was pretty much the architect of the war strategy during that time, and it's funny, I didn't even realize until after the movie that he may have been the one major problem I had with this movie. I like Pitt; think he's a decent actor, but here, like in ""Inglorious Basterds"", he seems to be playing the character as if he's dismissing him/lampooning him. TBH, I would've preferred a more realistic approach to the character, and in fact, think that would've added to the humor more? I dunno. Topher Grace, Griffin Dunne, Anthony Michael Hall, etc.. co-star, and was that Meg Tilly as Pitt's wife in this?? -- hadn't seen her in anything in awhile."
"rebaaron-1","1","2","18","3 July 2017"," Hollywood Leftists make another anti-war movie
","This movie has every Hollywood anti-war cliché in it. If you kill the enemy, it just makes more enemies. If you jail criminals you just get more criminals. Wars can't be won, especially by fighting. The indigenous people are happy to have El Quaida, ISIS, or the Taliban rule them. They don't want to be saved. They do. That still doesn't mean it's America's job to do it. The problem is we fight the wars stupidly. First we can't seem to identify the enemy. If Iran is the problem, we should be fighting in Iran not Afghanistan. The Israelis make the same mistake, facing off against Hezballah when the real address for their enemy is Iran. They should be hitting Iran with everything they've got not getting their noses bloodied by Hezballah. Trump knows what to do. Let's just watch and learn."
"yujiang-76825","2","0","1","9 April 2020"," Lack of Basic Military Etiquette
","After watching the movie from Netflix for just 5 minutes, I quit. Anyone who has watched some solid military movies/tv shows, even if s/he has not had any military background, would know that the director of this movie does not know basic military etiquette. The very first scene, for example, when the four start general walks cockily toward his men, shows a lack of understanding how subordinates would have to immediately stand up the moment they see the four star general arrives. Everyone would be at attention and the general would typically say ""at easy, gentlemen"" or something like that. Similarly, the next scene when the general is walking among or inspecting his troops, nobody solutes, and those personnel who are sitting do not even bother to stand up in attention to their commanding general (CG). This is absurd. Seeing this, I lost any interest of watching this movie any more. A total waste of money by David Michôd. These two scenes alone show his disinterest in learning even basic protocols before he directs."
"v_savin2000","10","0","3","29 December 2019"," This is a Hollywood version of Nikolai Gogol's ""Dead souls"". Definitely a masterpiece.
","The title of the film - ""War machine"" - fully reflects the very essence of the military-political machine as well as the deep essence of the personality of General Glen.
The catchphrase is a quote from the movie: ""These guys thought they were the most important guys in the world.""..
It is unlikely that I will spoil someone's viewing of the film, if I say that it is the integrity, rightness & this excessively inflated ""importance of the mission"" (that is ""EGO"", false ""I"") which leads to the mechanical inadequacy of the main character, devoid of a _measure of distinction_. Plus nothing to add for the ""happy"" General's wife, for example. Unfortunately, the process of inner degradation is so irrevocable that ""integrity and uprightness"" practically deprive all these characters of the opportunity to realize the horror of emasculation (""robotization"") of their souls, lacking true deep sense of unity with other people.<br/><br/>Sad but true, the Oscar was given not to this masterpiece, but to the pseudo-patriotic ""The Hurt Locker"" with its primitive motto: ""war is a drug""... (((<br/><br/>P.S. Brad Pitt - brilliant play!!!"

"alisonmulligan","10","0","2","28 November 2019"," Brilliant film about the insanity of male aggression
","There's a lot going on in this film and I feel it's part of a massive turning point in human society - the rejection of violence by recognising its futility.<br/><br/>Look carefully and you'll see Special Forces soldier Jason Fox. This is the icing on the cake. If a member of the most aggressive battle hardened regiments is part of a film all about how insane male desire for power is, I am really heartened we're moving to leave violence behind."

"scvj-06911","5","0","2","23 June 2017"," Pitt mugs a caricature
","War Machine has a fine script and a cast of incredibly talented actors who gave their all to the characters they portrayed-except for the star. I like Brad Pitt and think he's a terrific actor, but he needs a strong director who isn't afraid to tell him to stop mugging and start acting. Unfortunately, for most of the movie he delivered a nudge-nudge-wink-wink ""I think this guy I'm playing is a real tool"" caricature of a performance. I don't know if he thinks the audience is incapable of not swooning over his handsome face every time we see it, or he lacks the confidence to play a non-romantic, semi-unsympathetic lead character with the straight respect every character (and the audience) deserves. This movie would have been near perfect if only he'd done that.<br/><br/>The movie makes important and interesting points about career soldiers who are true-believers, enlistees caught in something they don't understand but who're committed to give everything, the politics and big business of war, futility of thinking we can win the hearts of a people whose country we've invaded... and does so entertainingly! <br/><br/>There's no shortage of stand-out performances: Meg Tilly, Ben Kingsley, Will Poulter, Alan Ruck, Lakeith Stanfield, Tilda Swinton, Emory Cohen are just a few of the amazing players in this large-as-an-army cast. In the end I found myself wishing Brad Pitt and Russell Crowe had switched parts."
