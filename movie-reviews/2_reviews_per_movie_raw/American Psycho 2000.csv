","One of the weirdest movies I've seen. Saw on video tape when it came out then recently watched it again 18 years later. Forgot how fun it is to watch. The absurdity of Bale's character Patrick Bateman's shallowness and preoccupation with superficial things like how upset he gets over a colleague having a better business card than him makes this movie comedic while he's slicing up victims. Still not sure about whether or not all of the things happening were all in his head. I guess that's up for anyone's interpretation of the story. Very well done and one of Bale's best performances as if he's ever performed badly."

","In 1991, Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel ""American Psycho"" took the world by storm - women accused it of being misogynist, sexist filth and others were understandably shaken by its brutal and graphic depictions of unprovoked violence and torture.<br/><br/>Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people."" It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time.<br/><br/>In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone (""I just had to kill a lot of people!"") or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' ""Fore"" album before hitting an associate over the head with an axe.<br/><br/>Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal - he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster - complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, ""American Psycho"" is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era - sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong - and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, ""American Psycho"" hits strong and hard - this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle - it never was.<br/><br/>The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and ""Hip to Be Square""; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein.<br/><br/>Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co-starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home - he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.<br/><br/>Since its release, many critics have accused ""American Psycho"" of being a watered-down version of the book, being both ""politically correct"" and ""lacking satire."" However, I don't recall the last time I saw a man beat a dog to death with the heel of his shoe in a mainstream motion picture. Or chase after a prostitute completely naked, wielding a bloodied chainsaw. Or hold a gun to a cat's head and threaten to feed it to an ATM machine.<br/><br/>In fact, when ""American Psycho"" was previewed before the Motion Picture Association of America, they gave it an NC-17 rating - not for its violence, as one might expect, but rather for its threesome scene between Patrick and two prostitutes.<br/><br/>Director Mary Harron cut footage from the film and finally managed to achieve an R-rating, but on a new ""Uncut Killer Collector's Edition"" DVD, you can see the film as it was intended to be seen - and it's a real fine treat. Now excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes."
"DanielStephens1988","9","29","31","15 July 2019"," American Psycho is not a story about murder
","The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality.
People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Feynman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despair<br/><br/>It's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society. Bateman's interpretation of the world is skewed by his inflated ego and his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses. Bateman is a killer, but still, he's not the killer he thinks he is, as he goes insane he can't distinguish reality from fantasy. His over the top chainsaw massacre style killings may be an aestheticized elaboration on partial truths, ultimately the film doesn't care. The more significant point of the movies absurdity is that within his society Batemans not the psycho at all he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality, secretly discontented American psychos. Bateman is surrounded by like-minded superficial people obsessed with all the wrong things like making impossible reservations at Dorsia and the tasteful thickness of their business cards. Within the homogenized upper-class elite identities blur as everyone strives after a generic yet highly specific image of success.<br/><br/>Everyone we see in Bateman's company appears to be the same person. It's no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously and swapped throughout the film. The lawyer has mistaken Paul Allen or perhaps Batman has killed the wrong person becomes not only plausible but also an expression of the general confusion resulting from the loss of individual identity.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, although Batman tries like the rest to fit in, the emptiness of his lifestyle also fuels a craving to stand out. To escape the conformity that he on some level despises Batman leads a second life as a killer, where he's unfettered from the bounds of society. Although he actually wants to be seen as a murderer as someone different from the rest of society Bateman is denied even the satisfaction by every self-absorbed yuppie he meets. When he's seen stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, the witness is only interested in the bag.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue."

","Having just finished American Psycho, I came to IMDB to get some clarification on the ending. And it seems I'm not the only one left vaguely adrift by the ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>I've browsed some of your comments, not all 400+ to be sure. But some of them. A good sampling I think, and this movie has three distinct cheering sections.<br/><br/>Those who consider it a masterpiece, those who consider it unredeemable, boring trash, and by far the largest segment, those who see it as a flawed masterpiece.<br/><br/>I fall into the latter category. And no, I did not read the book. But as others have stated any movie that requires you to read the book, to ""get"" the movie, is ultimately a failure as a movie.<br/><br/>So my review is based solely on the merits of the film. And contrary to what some have said, the film does have many merits. I found it brilliantly directed, and a superbly acted examination of excess, and boredom, and evil. An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking.<br/><br/>
Even before seeing the ending, I thought how much bateman lives in people. Found myself thinking, an examination of bateman is an examination of men by the name of Reagan and Bush. How American Psycho is an examination of our times, and our modern theologies.<br/><br/>I found the movie as a whole riveting, loved the restraint shown (and disagree with those calling for more gore, I think Mary should be applauded for her deft hand, the scenes have more power for what is not shown), and was captivated by nearly every scene, by scenes others have called boring, but I found profound.<br/><br/>Bateman putting on his makeup, or simply trying to get a restaurant, and the near apocalyptic importance, such minutiae makes in the lives of empty men. The right card, or the right cloth, or the right table, or the right watch, how these are the signposts of an empty age and an empty soul, and how these things have more value than your fellow man... or woman.<br/><br/>Bateman attains everything the materialistic times tells him he should want, but once he gets it he feels nothing. Emptier than before, less than before. It's only in the extremes of his addictions he begins to feel something, anything. He feeds to fill the emptiness, but the more he feeds the emptier he gets. He eats at his fellowman (woman) but in his bloodlust he eats at himself.<br/><br/>He is the American dream, taken to its cannibalistic extremes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And never before has makeup, played such a mesmerizing part in a movie. Bateman's(Chris Bale's) face at times when he is under stress, takes on a plastic look, a glossy, sweaty sheen, and for all the world it looks like he's wearing a mask... and the mask, his mask of sanity, is beginning to run.<br/><br/>Simply amazing use of makeup. And incredible performance by the lead actor. I wasn't familiar with him before this, but everyone will be after this.<br/><br/>Upon first hearing about this movie, I had no desire to see it. I've grown up since the age of Hills Have Eyes and trash like The Beyond, watching people suffer no longer seems significant. I guess as we get older we ask more of our art than springer, or the WWF, or slasher flicks. We ask of our art to tell us something true. Something of ourselves, and our world.<br/><br/>I think American Psycho under the deft hand of Mary Harron becomes more than my prejudices, and exceeds my expectations. Rises at times to dizzying heights not unlike art.<br/><br/>Mary's restraint makes this movie. But I fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well. The ending is too ambiguous. Who is Bateman in the end. Is there a Bateman? And what did he do or did not do?<br/><br/>In the end,the movie will nag at you. Did he or didn't he? And in the end, now that I write this I'm thinking maybe the answer doesn't really matter, maybe in the end the answer is the same. In the end a sin of thought, or a sin of action, is still a sin. In the end we are left with a man, and a nation... whose mask is slipping.<br/><br/>
I think like the first Psycho, time will prove this one.... worthy. I now add Mary Harron to the small selection of modern directors I will tiptoe through broken glass to see. Directors like Dave Fincher(Seven, Fight Club), Carl Franklin(Devil in a Blue Dress), Johnny To(Expect the Unexpected), Ringo Lam(Full Alert, Victim), M. Night Shyamalan(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), and Peter Weir(Fearless).<br/><br/>Recommended."

","'American Psycho' is NOT a slasher movie. It is a depiction, a fantasy if you will, of the life of modern man and his place in society.<br/><br/>Nothing is enough. Money, sex, social stature, there is always someone else who has more and everyone else expect from you to try harder for even more.<br/><br/>This movie is about eliminating competition the easy way. By killing your opponents. By eating your sexual partners. By destroying everyone around you.<br/><br/>'American Psycho' retains the balance between this psychotic state, a chilling thriller and a very funny movie.<br/><br/>The scenes that show Patrick playing music for his guests are absolutely hilarious, as he comments very seriously on records by artists such as Whitney Houston, Phil Collins and Huey Lewis & the News. The funny thing is that he chooses the most commercial or sold out records of these artists, to explain how much better they are compared to their previous, more artistic work. Another message of the state of the receivers of commercial art.<br/><br/>You can analyze 'American Psycho' for hours. It can be perceived both as a deep and a fun movie. Even if you don't like the story, you will love Christian Bale's excellent performance.<br/><br/>Enjoy.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Now it all makes sense. Christian Bale was born to play horror characters. I couldn't understand why I was so , so, afraid of him even in films like ""Velvet Goldmine"" He is a poster boy for putrid souls in elegant wrapping. In ""American Psycho"" - a film that deserves much more attention than it's got - he is absolutely terrific. Totally believable. I could sense his delight in playing a monster of this kind. Interestingly enough this manicured monster seems to be asking for sympathy, imagine the nerve! But Christian Bale succeeds in showing us a face we (I) hadn't quite seen before and yet we (I) accept without question. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination but, fortunately, he didn't."
"movie-monster","10","46","56","5 December 2008"," 'I simply am not there...'
","Its interesting that Christian Bale's most critically acclaimed role, in this very movie, is as a cold, psychotic and shallow yuppie. He excels by playing a character who openly admits that his only identifiable emotions are 'greed' and 'disgust'.<br/><br/>Firstly, this film should not be misinterpreted as a horror movie. Those who have read the Brett Easton Ellis novel will already be aware of this. It is more a satire, or a harsh and uncompromising commentary on the material excess of Wall Street, or indeed America as a whole (hence the title), during the mid-to-late 80's. It works on both these levels and many more.<br/><br/>The film starts as it means to continue. Bale's character, Patrick Bateman, introduces himself, and, as in the novel, goes into absurd detail regarding his washing habits and exercise regimes. For the next hour and a half, the audience is invited into his world. A world in which vanity itself, it seems, is everything. His life is composed almost entirely of expensive meals out with his high-flying friends & disillusioned girlfriend(played adequately by Reese Witherspoon), and various random, sadistic acts of violence and mutilation.<br/><br/>Despite all Batemans' wealth, he is emotionally bankrupt. Love and relationships are as disposable as the world he lives in. For the entire film, Bale relishes the role and never lets it slip, talking as if he's in some warped commercial for a shallow and completely hedonistic eighties lifestyle. A lifestyle which leads nowhere. Bateman's character is also loaded with contradictions and hypocrisy. In one of the opening scenes, he wastes no time describing how he believes 'in taking care of himself', but days later will be snorting cocaine in a public toilet. Later, he describes how 'we need to provide food and shelter for the homeless', which is delivered as a speech to seemingly promote Bateman's morality in front of his peers. Shortly afterwards, he stabs a tramp to death in an alleyway. This speech acts as an omen or as a warning to crimes he will commit, or will imagine committing later in the film. His references to women in particular, soon become disturbingly ironic.<br/><br/>Authenticity is added to the movie in the form of music and reference to the AIDS epidemic, which was just starting to take hold of the American consciousness. Bateman's highly unstable and vacuous state of mind is relayed through several brilliant quotes and scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>One example is the scene in which he examines his colleagues business cards in depth, and becomes so obsessed and frustrated by the minor differences in colour and font that his hand visibly shakes. Upon seeing Paul Allen's card he whispers to himself in genuine horror; 'oh my god...it even has a watermark.' In Bateman's world, this could well be interpreted as the reasoning behind him murdering Allen later in the film.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is left open to interpretation by the viewer, and it should definitely be watched several times. Its often hard to draw the line between reality and Bateman's own fantasies. Indeed many, if not all, of his murderous acts, could be simply figments of his own twisted imagination. The character Donald Kimble could indeed be an illusion. He interviews Bateman several times in the movie, at times appearing oblivious to the possibility of Bateman murdering Allen, and then later effectively accusing him of it.<br/><br/>What the film really illustrates, much like the book, is a culture and an entire way-of-life, taken too a brutal, disturbed, and even demented extreme. It is a fusion of America's most beautiful dream, and its most hideous, blood-soaked nightmare. Money is no longer a barrier for Bateman. He can have all the women, sex, narcotics, technology and expensive meals he will ever desire. There is nothing left for him or his friends to aspire too. When every line has been crossed on a daily basis, he can only find satisfaction in the most depraved and barbaric of acts, and in the end, even this isn't enough.<br/><br/>While the book is considerably more graphic and detailed, I would have to say I prefer the film. All the important and relevant aspects of Bateman's life and psyche are featured and Bale's performance elevates it to true 'cult classic' status. His portrayal of Bateman creates, in my opinion, one of the most vivid, cruel, iconic and unforgettable characters in the history of film."
"perica-43151","10","37","45","27 June 2018"," Classic masterpiece
","This movie is a masterpiece, and it is so underrated. So many quotable moments, true perfect cult piece. Violence is measured, much milder than in the book, which is improved on. It shows the true side of Wall Street morality, of all the little Eichmanns that lived and still live in Manhattan. Dark comedy genius, with classic shiny ax scene perfectly in tune with ""Hip to be Square"" music, that Weird Al and Huey Lewis parodied in perfect meta homage. This movie works on so many levels, and although it was hated by the corporate elite and their paid hypocrite critics, time has shown that this movie is going to last. This is Wolf of Wall Street on steroids, wrapped in metaphysical, if murderous, clothing."
"ctcrmcou","8","36","44","28 March 2008"," It's all fantasy
","Finally saw the movie - it was one of five free blu-rays in a rebate with Sony Playstation.<br/><br/>Many comments wondered if it was real or not.<br/><br/>There are several giveaways that the murders were fantasies. Many times Bateman says things that are evil and violent to someone, but are heard by the recipient of the comments as something else.<br/><br/>The outright murders with no witnesses, blowing up the cops vehicles for an easy escape, dragging bodies and blood through lobbies, the cleaned up apartment with no dead bodies in sight, no investigators or police crime scene tape where there should have been, .... it goes on and on. Don't forget the final scene with his lawyer. The fantasies were manifested only in the notebook found in his desk by his secretary. I'm happy she was ""spared"".<br/><br/>I found the lack of pursuit by Willem Dafoe (the detective) to be a letdown. The initial questioning of Bateman was definitely right out of the original Psycho, and I found this confrontation as the start of a great ""gonna getcha"" in the end. But it never happened.<br/><br/>The only question is, why was a detective asking Bateman questions in the first place, or, was the idea of a missing colleague the spark for a fantasy, just shown after the fact.<br/><br/>I loved the business card one-upsmanship. It shows how shallow rich vice presidents (about a dozen were there?) are, and what losers they really are in life as people. Misery loves company, I guess. Reminded me a lot of the yuppies in Trading Places. Bored and prissy. Although they think they are living the ""good life"", but contribute nothing in the end.<br/><br/>It was a fun movie, probably sparks our fantasies about what we'd like to do with the scum of this earth - but that's why it's only a movie."

","... because with ""American Psycho"", Mary Harron and her screen writing partner have delivered the most faithful adaptation it would be possible to release without getting the film banned or revolting audiences so much that no one comes to see it. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to take some of the most extreme sequences from the book and commit them to film. What the movie instead does is to give us an insight into the stunningly fragile and insecure mind of Patrick Bateman, and to speculate whether his unstable nature would REALLY lead him to perpetrate vile acts, or whether he just fantasises about doing so.<br/><br/>I think it matters little in the context of this film whether Bateman's exploits are actually based in reality, because whether they are or they aren't, Bateman is still left in the grip of paranoia, brought on by the shallowness of the society that is around him. Bateman is less of a 'psycho' than a vessel for all the selfish evils of society to corrupt, and a sensible audience is more likely to be left reeling at how he has been turned into a 'robot', than by the discreet amounts of gore that do feature in the movie.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is fascinating to watch because Bateman is such a complex character. We feel revulsion at his violent tendencies, amused by his complete superficiality, and pity at his crumbling sanity. In order to evoke such diverse feelings from one performance, we need a superb actor. Bale's performance is right on the money. Never does HIS mask slip as does that of Patrick Bateman. He is completely believable in all his emotions.<br/><br/>There is NOTHING in the film that is not true to the book (although there are bits in the book that are not true to the film) Both the reading and watching experiences are valuable and rewarding ones, but what they share with each other is that while they're exploring somebody else's mental state, they are also probing that of their audience. Can we see the funny side in the fact that these murders were committed for very trivial reasons?<br/><br/>Can we ridicule someone with the knowledge that he is also a fantastically dangerous person? The film and book are constantly pushing boundaries, and if you don't fight that, but instead surrender to it, they will take you to many interesting places. Don't be afraid to give in to your emotions and laugh when you see something funny, because the movie shows us what emotional repression has done to someone like Patrick.<br/><br/>Kudos to Mary Harron for tackling a seriously difficult project and turning it into one of the cleverest movies of recent years. ""American Psycho"" is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is: Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you..."

A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in ""Little Women"". Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don't feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable. His rough sex with two women while he rides one of them looking at himself in the mirror is one of the most disturbing film moments I've ever seen.

"Movie-12","10","288","408","7 October 2001"," A great visual and psychological achievement. Christian Bale delivers a knock-out performance. **** (out of four)
","AMERICAN PSYCHO / (2000) **** (out of four)<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman: I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. ---""American Psycho""<br/><br/>	The average filmmaker would turn ""American Psycho"" into an exploitative slasher flick, but Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have adapted the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis into something unique and intriguing, a brilliant, thought-provoking social commentary thriller.<br/><br/>Readers criticized the decade old novel because of its graphic violence, but that doesn't cause Turner and Harron to give into the controversial material. I have never read the book, but after watching ""American Psycho,"" I intend to. It's a scathing, rare film that probes our imagination and beliefs while experimenting with true psychological terror. It often makes startling switches between scenes of dark comedy and sequences that portray unsettling, graphic images. Director Mary Harron says in the film's press notes that she wanted all but one of the violent sequences to be disturbing. The amount of blood and violence here is certainly extreme, but considering the nature of the beast, not overly abundant. The film calculates every single act of violence, therefore, the victims are seldom random characters, but people we care about, which is why the scenes are so timely and effective.<br/><br/>
The best description of the film's main character, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) comes from Christopher Lehmann-Houpt of The New York Times. ""Patrick Bateman lives in a morally flat world in which clothes have more value than skin, objects are worth more than bones, and the human soul is something to be sought with knives and hatchets and drills.""<br/><br/>
Both leading actors in ""American Psycho"" have previously portrayed Jesus Christ, Willem Dafoe in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" and Christian Bale in ""Mary, Mother of Jesus."" Talk about versatility. It's probably not a coincidence that Christian Bale was the initial actor of preference for Mary Harron. If an actor can display such a fascinating performance as Jesus Christ, he's more than capable of playing a psychotic serial killer because he already knows the other side of the moral spectrum.<br/><br/>
Through the strong central character, ""American Psycho"" suggests several themes about the 1980's, including society's obsession with outer perfection, conformity, the rising threshold of material fetishism, and the strong desire of stimulation by drugs, sex, money, and power. Patrick Bateman isn't given a back story, however, and the movie doesn't offer his personal history. Bateman has no inside emotions. He reacts by inner impulse alone. He seeks gratification through the sex and drugs, but also by engaging in the homicidal behavior.    <br/><br/>""You could describe American Psycho' as a film about perfect surfaces and what might be lurking beneath,"" says Mary Harron. ""Inside, Bateman might want it all to stop, but for him it's a compulsion. He's like the serial killer in M, who says: You have a choice, but I can't help what I am.'""<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" initially earned an NC-17 rating, not because of the violence but because of the graphic sexual content. The director's cut is available on videocassette and DVD, which shows the film's three-way sex scene in more disturbing, yet innovative, detail. That's a good thing, if you're not a sensitive viewer, because this film is all about details. The production design, the cinematography, the visual effects, the engaging soundtrack, the quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character, and every other aspect of the film is flush in detail.<br/><br/>
This is a movie that requires more than one viewing, to experience the surreal visual arena, and to justify what we think actually happened. Perplexingly, the film's conclusion puts the events into question. Did Bateman really kill these people, or did he just really want to? The answers don't come easy, but this is a movie that begs us to look closer"

","Without a doubt the most underrated movie of the past decade, ""American Psycho"" is a piece of American cinema that shouldn't be missed by anyone, regardless if they do not like the violence (which does have its reasons).<br/><br/>
Christian Bale gives a flawless performance as the troubled, deep down wannabe Yuppie who has psychotic, violent impulses. This is true acting here, folks. Not phoned in Tom Crooze acting. Some people object to Patrick Bateman narrating the movie [always a weak sign in a movie] and not letting us figure his motives out on our own, but if you watch closely, Bale shows us Bateman's vulnerablity through every minute of every day of his life. The movie is at times hysterical, as his character uses dominant Alpha Monkey behavior around the opposite sex. But again, it's all for good reason.<br/><br/>
If not for Bale's performance, see it for the knife twisting satire of the '80's -- from the clothes, to the hairdos, to the music [I'll never be able to hear Phil Collins in the same way again!] The production value is rich in '80's nostalgia from the ""Black and White"" set designs to the enormous cellphones [how could we forget those?].<br/><br/>This is a movie that major studios are too afraid to touch. This is film making. Remember film making? When films took you on a ride in someone's life and you would walk away with a piece of their mind? American Psycho doesn't have any real morals or answers, but it shows the deep psychological insecurities some men suffer everyday. Oh yeah, and it was directed by a woman, so all you feminists shut up!"

Leonardo Di Caprio? I think not.<br/><br/>How would Mary Harron deal with those controversial torture scenes?<br/><br/>What we got was one of the finest movies I have seen for some time. Of course, those of closed minds will slate this film without even bothering to see it, simply because of the book's notoriety.<br/><br/>I was impressed to see how closely Harron followed the book, replacing the un-filmable seens with suggestion, aka ear-cutting scene from resevior dogs, so that you believe you have seen more than you have. There are more parallels with Tarantino, such as the use of classic (& non classic ) 80's pop to create a stylised feel to the movie, that has not been seen since Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Casting was superb, with Cristian Bale giving the performance of a lifetime, We, the audience, saw the souless monster within, Batemans superficial aquaintences, saw another faceless human being.<br/><br/>Just like the book, you are never sure wether Batemans crimes are real, or just imaginary, but his slide into insanity is clearly real and paced expertly by Bale.<br/><br/>Rheese Witherspoon as Evelyn was disappointing, ""Election"" showed what a great actress she is and although this role called for an airhead performance, it was clear that she was cruising.<br/><br/>Mary Harron deserves the credit for creating an excellent film, that could have so easily been just another slasher movie."

","Highly satirical in tone, ""American Psycho"" punches Wall Street in the gut, and does so better than any other film I have seen about that odious institution. The story, set in 1987, ostensibly focuses on a 27 year-old exec named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who works in a Manhattan high-rise, for a company in the corporate ""mergers and acquisitions"" industry. He hobnobs with the chic and trendy. And his personality fits right in with that crowd: amoral, shallow, deceitful, condescending, selfish, sneering, and slick. But in his off-hours he commits blatant acts of violence. Patrick Bateman is a psychotic Gordon Gekko.<br/><br/>Yet, the script implies no back-story for Bateman or motivation for his antisocial behavior. Thinly veiled behind the obvious plot line is the film's subversive message. This Wall Street jerk is not a person so much as an analytical construct, an idea, representative of financial violence that lies beneath the veneer of material power and success that Wall Street prides itself on. Because Bateman exhibits overt physical violence, there's no way that viewers can look up to him as a role model like they can theoretically look up to Oliver Stone's Gekko. As such, ""American Psycho"" surpasses ""Wall Street"" (1987) in thematic potency.<br/><br/>The dialogue even says as much. In voice-over, Bateman tells us: ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me."" And Patrick's ""confession"" at the end is the confession of modern Wall Street.<br/><br/>The film's non-script technical quality is quite good. Cinematography, editing, costumes, prod design, art design, sound effects, and acting are all high quality. The semi-classical music in the opening credits provides clever irony. But I didn't care for the 1980s songs, though they are representative of that era.<br/><br/>The humorous, tongue-in-cheek tone prevents the film from being perceived as a too heavy-handed cinematic lecture. Instead, the film infers ""black comedy"", adroitly mixing the usually discordant genres of horror with social commentary.<br/><br/>In the Patrick Bateman character, ""American Psycho"" accurately describes the Wall Street mentality of the 1980s. That mentality has become blatantly more intense since then. As such, the film continues to be relevant and probably will remain so for a long time to come."

"jamalio9","Null","364","703","12 June 2003"," LENGTHY BOOK TO FILM COMPARISON: MAY ONLY MAKE SENSE TO THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE FILM AND WERE DISSAPOINTED
","There are numerous things wrong with this otherwise faithfull adaptation in terms of it's structure, plot and ability to portray a strong focus on it's lead character (although heavily watered down). For starters, it is far too tame. You may argue that a lot of the explicit sex and violence in the book was unnecessary but the truth is the Patrick Bateman in the book is obsessed with detail, perfection and routine, so he explains popular culture, food and restaurants and bathing products with the same explicit nature as he describes his killings with his victims and the sex he has with them beforehand. This was missing. I never once heard Patrick Bateman describe what he likes to do to his female victims in sickening detail. Although this was sick it does serve a purpose and would have proven to be a very uniquely cinematic function that would be very disturbing and almost something we have never seen before in a film. Plus the fact it would sidestep the censors as its not physical violence being committed, merely psychological. They lost something unique in this. Also Patrick Bateman in the book does some unbelievably f***** up things to his victims which makes it hard to read. That's why there was all the controversy. The film does NOT have this effect and it should at least have been shocking, and the fact that there was no controversy surrounding the films release sums it up quite well. It's like a book that is really heartbreaking and sad and brings you to tears but the adapted film doesn't make you feel this way- you often think that something important was missing and the film makers have missed the point.<br/><br/>Secondly were the production values. In the book you imagine the locations- Bateman's apartment, his office, the parties they attend, the nightclubs and restaurants, to exceed anything we could ever imagine and associate with 'rich' in reality. In the book they are lavish, far more than we could ever imagine. Now its fairly obvious that this film is relatively low budget and as result it suffers a little by showing us locations we would associate with upper middle class in a TV sitcom, not upper class people who have that sense of materialistic achievement the likes of which we never knew existed. And it's a little too obvious that most of it was shot in a film studio. Many of the characters in the book would frown upon the living conditions of what the characters in the film have.<br/><br/>Thirdly was Patrick Bateman himself. He was never this much of a geek in the book. He was a very powerful, ruthless man, who describes all that sense of materialism that is apparently appealing to most humans, whilst displaying a sense of genuine animosity and sinister ness that you would almost regard as 'inhuman'. A lot of people miss the point of this; sometimes your confused as to whether he is human or some form of demon and it plays with your perceptions a little, thereby proving to be the most disturbing element of the book itself. Patrick Bateman in the book is actually very well respected and his possibly so far at the top of his game its no surprise he appears to be inhuman. In the film he is a run of the mill yuppie that is a bit of a loser compared to his mates. In the film he does what he does 'cause he feels he has no choice, in the book he does what he does 'cause he gets such a kick out of it and is such a spoilt brat that enjoying the most expensive things in life are not enough for him. He is so disgusted with meals, clothes, other products etc that don't cost thousands of dollars and aren't the best it is actually quite unbelievable yet interesting, and you get the sense that he spends a thousand just to walk out his door. You don't get a sense of what an expensive life Patrick Bateman lives in the film. Also in the book he really is a ladies man and wherever he goes he always gets a chicks phone number- which would lead onto inevitable consequences. In the film he often has to rely on hookers- one of which the ugly blonde one, who is so ugly the character in the book wouldn't even look at her (the book version of his character is VERY fussy about his women and wouldn't have sex with her unless she was 100% perfect looking, and NOT one that has the characteristics of a yorkshire terrier). In short, the book version of Patrick Bateman would have eaten the one in the film (literally alive) for breakfast in terms of greed and corruption and wanting the best of everything.<br/><br/>Fourthly was the scope of the film, again a fault with the films production values. In the book the characters get up to far more interesting things- conference meetings, huge parties, rock concerts, opera and so one, in the film all they ever seem to do is go to the same nightclub and restaurants and sit around and talk. As a result the film shows little achievement as to some of the excitement the characters get up to. That's also what was disturbing about the book, it shows a lifestyle that these yuppies have that entices you and almost makes you feel a little envious of what they get up to. In the film the characters lives are just boring, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Last of all (and thank god after all my bitching) the other characters in the book are far more complex and interesting than the 1 dimensional representation we get of them in the film. All of them are obsessed about the same things as Bateman who isn't such a loner and makes you question whether or not they get up to the same things as Bateman despite the fact that they give the impression otherwise. All of them are vain and are obsessed with looking good and getting the best out of everything. Again in the film they are just traditional yuppies.<br/><br/>Well I'm sorry I've bored you after this lengthy comparison but if you have read the book long ago as I have; and expected something special and monumental as the book was, rather than a film that was too small scale and lacked the passion and ambition it so desperately needed, I'm sure you'd agree. There should have been moments in this film that really shocked you into realising what a human being is capable of in terms of committing acts of evil towards others but alas, all we got was a naked guy running down a corridor wearing sneakers and wielding a chainsaw. I feel that the strongest thing about the film is easily Christian Bales' outstanding performance, and you wonder what could have been achieved in the hands of a greater director like Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma or even Martin Scorsese, who had a bigger budget and a little more verve and daringness to do it more justice, rather than Mary Hannon's merely competent but pedestrian and un-cinematic take on the book"

","First, I have to say that I really did enjoy the film very much. I also read the book AFTER seeing the film, which I think gives me a unique perspective as opposed to those who read the book, then saw the film as a disappointment.<br/><br/>With that having been said, I was amazed with the excruciating detail that the novel's Patrick Bateman went into when describing his life and routine. Bret Easton Ellis is a truly remarkable author, and the novel is really a masterpiece of 1980's satire. I honestly can't say enough good things about it. Every page was amazing to me, and I felt that a portrait of a madman had really been painted for us in a way that nobody has done before.<br/><br/>The film lacked a lot of this detail, but it was only noticeable after reading the book. I can see how someone who read the book first, then saw the film could have been disappointed, but seeing the film before the book really made me appreciate both much more than I may have otherwise. For someone who has no experience with either the film or the book, I would recommend the movie first, then followed up with the novel. The movie is very enjoyable and interesting on it's own, and the novel adds a tremendous dimension and back-story to the characters and their motivations.<br/><br/>Also, one of the criticisms that I read in a previous review had to do with the locations not being believable due to the limited budget of the production. However, as a lifelong resident of Manhattan, the sets and locations ring very true. Pat Bateman's apartment in the movie is a really accurate representation of what a multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment actually looks like. Money does not go very far in this town, and it actually states in the book that Timothy Price made approximately $190,000/year, so it can be presumed that Bateman earned a similar amount. A hefty sum for the time, but not quite billionaire status. The restaurants and offices are also quite realistic and believable, especially since I have actually been to most of the places that are mentioned in the book.<br/><br/>Finally, after the film and novel, I have to say that I actually found Pat Bateman someone who I could really relate to on some level, scary though that may sound. The obsession with material possessions; having everything in your life arranged perfectly; the drive to have the best (clothes, apartment, dinner reservations, women, etc), is something that still permeates the culture here in NYC to such a degree that I found many of his obsessions (compulsions?) and mannerisms extremely familiar. Disconcerting as it is, I can easily see where Brett Ellis' mind was when he fleshed out the Bateman character. From this point of view, it's almost easy to see how such behavior can mutate into insanity without even the blink of an eye. It's certainly made me look at my own life in a different light."

","In New York, the narcissist investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works in the bank of his fiancée's father and usually has dinner with his shallow coworkers at fashionable and expensive restaurants. Bateman worships notorious serial-killers, such as Ed Gein or Ted Bundy, and he is a psychopath. When his co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) shows a business card of better quality than his, Bateman plots to kill him using the name of another colleague. He murders Paul with an ax and tapes a message in his answering machine telling that Paul is travelling to London. Soon the private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) investigates Paul's disappearance and interviews Bateman. Then Bateman hires two prostitutes to spend the night with him doing kinky sex and he tortures the women. Bateman tries to kill a homosexual co-worker; murders a model; and tries to kill his own secretary. Who will stop his crime spree?<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is an ambiguous, dark and dramatic thriller about a sick yuppie that cannot control his death wish. The viewer never knows whether Patrick Bateman really kills the persons or is delusional with a perverted mind. The black humor and the mystery of the last scenes creates the doubt in the viewer. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Beazil): ""Psicopata Americano"" (""American Psycho"")"
"edantheman","Null","7","9","22 May 2013"," I like to dissect films. Did you know I'm utterly mundane?
","When Bret Easton Ellis's novel 'American Psycho' was released in 1991, many accused him and his work of misogyny. It isn't hard to see why: female characters are depicted as either vacuous or stupid and are usually mutilated or killed by Wall Street banker Patrick Bateman, an undoubtedly misogynistic protagonist. Which is why noted feminist Mary Harron fought tooth and nail to direct Guinevere Turner's film adaptation with Christian Bale as her leading man, after creative pairings such as Oliver Stone and Leonardo Dicaprio and David Cronenberg and Brad Pitt fell through. And how inspired her vision is! While a male director may have been impressed by the Nietzchean aspect of Bateman, Harron regards him as a hopelessly vain and emotionally underdeveloped young man, weak for being unable to control his violent impulses. One suspects a male director would not have let his camera linger on our antihero in the shower for quite so long as well.<br/><br/>Christian Bale veers from smarm to plain evil in every scene. A vapid grin will flash upon his face just as quickly as the light will glint off the side of the axe he ploughs into a colleague's face. As the late critic Roger Ebert said of his performance (couldn't have put it better myself), ""there is no instinct for self-preservation here"". A far cry from the pretentious 'Dark Knight' films of late, then. With an emotional range of, as the character expresses it, 'greed and disgust', he doesn't provide us with much to relate to as a human being but as the actor himself has said, ""he's certainly a guy you'd like to eavesdrop on"". More so than the countless other vapid shells of inhumanity surrounding him, who often have no lines to read but serve to remind us that Patrick Bateman is, in his own words ""an abstraction... something illusory..."" <br/><br/>In a movie about endemic consumerism, everyone has been made-up to look indistinct within their scene, with nearly identical glasses, haircuts and suits. Hair and make-up also deserve particular credit for creating the monster's face. A glimmering sheen of sweat on his otherwise perfectly composed visage tells us when he's 'on the verge of frenzy' and a single tremor in his herb-mint facial mask of sanity reminds us it is always about to slip. His fanatical devotion to a rigorous exercise routine, balanced diet and daily beautification regimen borders on the religious. Never has the lipstick and rouge been applied so subtly yet significantly as here.<br/><br/>To aurally demonstrate to us how much men have 'evolved', in the scene where our WASPs compare business cards, SFX designer Benjamin Cheah employs the sound of a sword being removed from it's sheath to draw parallels with the equivalent practice of their knight ancestors of Britain and the Netherlands in Medieval times. It reveals, terrifyingly, how little man has really evolved since. A soundtrack that wouldn't seem out of place in any piece of Hollywood fluff of it's era serves only to heighten our protagonist's psychopathy here.<br/><br/>Whether it's Phil Collins' epic meditation on intangibility 'Invisible Touch' or Whitney Houston's ode to monogamy and commitment 'The Greatest Love of All', Bateman clearly likes the product they're selling him: life, security and happiness (without the pursuit –an AmEx credit card will do). He would value a wife and son much in the same way as he would a new Louis Vuitton watch or Giorgio Armani suit. An item is an item to him: something he has to have. When he gives his dinner guests the sanctimonious lecture on world hunger, he's merely imitating something he's heard on TV. Content means nothing, form is everything (""...inside doesn't matter..."").<br/><br/>After implausibly shooting it out in the street with the cops, Bateman crashes in his office where he tearfully confesses his many crimes, mostly ones unseen by us, to his lawyer over the answering machine (the detachment of the 80s now seems relatively intimate). The next day, however, a prescription-drug mood-controlled Bateman confronts him in a downtown bar only to find that his guilty voicemail has been mistaken for a joke. Meanwhile his secretary Jean, the only sympathetic character of the story, peruses his business diary of gory doodlings in the film's only scene removed from the perspective of our own 'psycho'. So, which is it short for? Have we all been witness to the inner-ravellings of a psychotic? –that particular strain of unreliable narrator being a popular theme at the time, e.g. 'Fight Club', 'Memento'. It would seem unlikely that Harron, or Ellis for that matter, would want to waste ninety minutes of our time studying a character who, by his own admission, is 'simply not there'. Not that it isn't a character study.<br/><br/>Rather, it is one of a nation. A singularly American psychopath. There is great significance in Ronald Reagan delivering his address to the nation regarding the Iran-Contra scandal on the TV moments before Bateman confesses to camera. In the speech, Reagan denied having knowledge of the unlawful dealings while refusing to apologise for his ignorance. When Nixon announced his resignation apropos the Watergate scandal, the American people were outraged. Fast-forward thirteen years and they were too sedated by psychotropic drugs and MTV to give a sh*t that a shadow government had been selling arms to Islamic militants in Iran with the proceeds funding anti-communist death squads in Nicaragua, all in their name. Much the same can be said of the yuppies depicted herein; who claim to have dined with Paul Allen after Bateman killed him, fail to hear his sinister homicidal remarks over drinks or misinterpret his deadly advances. They mistake each other for different people throughout, which would seem to uphold his psychopathy. The film is best viewed as an allegory for the all-consuming male vanity and self-absorption of the time period. The beginning of the end of patriarchy.<br/><br/>This review has meant something."
"JC_Ride","10","3","3","10 June 2020"," ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman...
","Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me"". At first glance one might think that this is a horror film about ""the perfect psychopath"". It isn't. The movie deals excessively with themes of identity and standing out, and it also serves as a powerful critique to yuppie culture and late 1980s America in general. The cast is extremely talented but Christian Bale steals the show, with his memorable portayal of a completely insane individual.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is a walking contradiction. The personification of greed and insanity hiding behind the mask of a good looking yuppie. He spends the entire intro describing his morning routine, but then later in the movie he's snorting coke in a public bathroom. He goes on about helping the poor, and later on stabs a tramp to death for no good reason.<br/><br/>The slightest of things irritates him. He won't let people touch him and he shakes when he sees a business card that's perhaps slightly better than his. In fact thay simple card is his motivation to kill Paul Allen. He takes pleasure in killing and dismembering prostitutes, and as the film progresses he dives into insanity to the point were he can barely descern reality. His girlfriend and friends have zero meaning whatsoever to him. He doesn't work, all he cares about is music and getting reservations at fine restaurants, and murdering people of cource.<br/><br/>Other that the incredible portrayal of Bateman, the movie also comes with very nice cinematography with extreme attention to detail, great acting and a killer soundtrack. The movie is chilling but also hilarious due to the sheer ridiculousness of Batemans character.<br/><br/>But what i think sets this movie apart and makes it worth a 10/10 is the ending. The whole absurd sequence of Patrick feeding a stray cat to an ATM and randomly murdering people leads to him breaking down and confessing everything, finally seeking to be punished for his heinous crimes. But that won't come. Cause society doesnt care. The real estate agent that sells Paul Allens apartment takes care of the bodies Patrick has dismembered just to sell the apartment, and when he comes and she realises he's the killer, she just tells him to leave. Whenever Patrick confesses to his crimes noone believes him or they mishear his words. And even when he confesses everything to his lawyer, he doesnt even recognise him and thinks it's a prank cause he recently had dinner with the murdered Paul Allen. So was it all in Batemans head? Was it all real? Was parts of it real and parts of it figments of Patricks twisted imagination? Did he even kill Paul Allen? Or did the lawyer mistook Paul for another person, since it's a common thing in the movie for people not to be able to recognise one another. Regardless, Patricks ""catharsis"" won't come. He's trapped in this meaningless life of fancy suits, dinner reservations and senseless murder that goes unpunished. I don't think sharing my opinion of what trully went down is important, half the fun of the movie is figuring out the messages and interpreting the story as you wish.<br/><br/>A masterfully crafted dive into insanity. A solid 10/10 from me!"

Harron's direction is very impressive as she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction and reality with great finesse. American Psycho is a fascinating vignette of lunacy and obsession as it intriguingly blends its elements of horror and dark comedy into an exquisitely paced, masterfully directed and magnificently written story that delves into the mind and psyche of its incredibly deranged individual with plenty of success, and remains one of the finest achievements of its genre(s) and of the greatest movies of the 2000s."

","NOTE: This comment involves spoilers.<br/><br/>I rented this movie last night thinking it would be a gripping, psychological tale of cat-and-mouse between Christian Bale's serial killer and Willem DaFoe's detective.  I have no idea how I got so confused, to think this film would offer up a plot of that level of quality, but I must have somehow connected it with ""Silence of the Lambs"" on some subconscious level.  What I wound up watching was a pointless and stupid compilation of cliches without any satisfying denouement to the story, that needlessly drained 100 minutes from my life on earth.<br/><br/>This is one of those films people either love or hate, I've observed.  I'm proud to put myself in the latter category.  Fans of ""American Psycho"" have raved about it's biting depiction of Manhattan in the 1980's.  Perhaps that was what started me off on the wrong foot, for that decade is one that is best left forgotten.  As it turned out, so is the plot of this movie.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is, hands-down, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, alongside of ""Sleepaway Camp"" and ""Apt Pupil.""  I don't have an objection to violent films overall; I am certainly not one of those anti-Hollywood types lecturing about movie content today, but the events that occurred in this tale were just brutal and disturbing, and had no message attached, other than showing us what some crazy jerk is capable of. I grew up watching flicks like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween,"" but now that I'm older perhaps I just don't see the point of gratuitous, shocking mayhem such as what's in this film.  There's nothing positive about the movie, but there is much that's negative and depressing, such that it made ""Seven"" look like ""Mary Poppins"" in terms of cheerfulness.<br/><br/>The central character, Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) is the embodiment of the movie's title.  He provides us with a string of glimpses into his life and mental state that constitute nothing more than ""See Patrick shower.  See Patrick go to the office.  See Patrick socialize with his rich Wall Street buddies.  See Patrick cheat on his fiancee.  See Patrick kill for no reason.""  While he does narrate some of his perspective on life to the viewer, it's tired and predictable, and reminiscent of the Thomas Harris' novel ""Red Dragon.""  There is never any background on Bateman; no details of his family or childhood, but that's just as well for it would probably consist of even more stereotypes.  All you need to know about Bateman is that he is pure scum who hurts others any way he can (whether by killing, cheating, or just plain arrogant condescension) for enjoyment.<br/><br/>I have to give Bale credit for a powerful portrayal of his character, but that's exactly the problem with watching Bateman in action.  He is too much to take; his annoying, smarmy tone of voice, facial expressions and snotnosed attitude are all guaranteed to provoke heavy loathing in the viewer long before he even starts slaughtering his fellow New Yorkers.  And not a ""good"" loathing in the sense you're gripped by the story, but rather an overall disgust for having to even view such a person or listen to him speak.  If you knew someone who acted like Bateman you would hasten to remove yourself from his presence; you certainly wouldn't give him 100 minutes of your time.  It's no different seeing him on the screen. Watching the life of such an absolutely reprehensible person as this leaves you feeling like you bathed in a sewer.  Bateman's high-rolling friends and associates are almost as universally unredeeming, the only distinction between they and Bateman is that they don't kill people.  The only characters towards which one might feel empathy are either killed off by Bateman or too clueless to get in his way.<br/><br/>A truly heart-wrenching scene early on involving a homeless man and his dog sets the nauseating pace for the rest of the movie, which I proceeded to watch only in the grim hope of seeing swift, harsh justice delivered to Bateman; i.e. in the form of the usual desperate police shootout in the final frames.  Sadly, even that common element of the ""serial killer flick"" was left out in favor of a myriad of obfuscating ""let's leave the viewer in the dark"" details.  I'm aware that some of the compliments directed towards this film are based on the very ambiguity of the ending, or the view of Bateman's [further] descent into madness.  While these seem paramount to some, to me it was just lame and uninteresting.  DaFoe's detective, who shows such promise early on, really serves as nothing more than a red herring in this film.<br/><br/>Some fans have commented on the elements of this movie which they feel cause a person to think.  I ""get"" everything about ""American Psycho"" - that is to say, nothing ""went over my head,"" so someone more enthusiastic about the film than I should not think I just wasn't paying attention.  I just didn't think it mattered, or was compelling.  When the final scene rolled past the only reaction I felt was relief, that I was done watching this miserable movie.  I got up this morning and took it back to Blockbuster with the express intention of getting it out of my house and off my hands.<br/><br/>Readers of this review will probably wonder why I invested several paragraphs in commenting on ""American Psycho"" if I despised it so much. The answer is simple: catharsis.  Save your bucks and rent ""Wild, Wild West instead"" - it's ""The Godfather"" by comparison."

","I'd heard a lot about the original novel though I'd never read it , possibly because it sounded like product placement with the anti hero giving long winded descriptions of what beauty products he uses and what designer suits he wears . This is translated into the start of the movie as Patrick Bateman washes , shaves , ex foliates and dresses in brand names . There's two problems with this , firstly that it holds up the main plot of a violent serial killer bumping people off and secondly it doesn't connect with people like me who didn't spend a massive fortune on expensive brand products in the 1980s <br/><br/>Did you know this story was set in 1980s New York ? Oh yes you notice things like mobile phones the size of the brick , smoking in bars , and really crap music by Phil Collins and Huey Lewis And The News , but for much of the running time you totally forget what decade the story is set . Did anyone notice giant shoulder pads or hair like exotic plants ? , y'know fashion statements from the 80s some people don't like to talk about today . All these things seem to be missing as if director Mary Harron has only included 80s icons when the screenplay specifically referred to them . Watch WALL STREET just before you watch this and you'll instantly notice that one movie was obviously filmed during the 1980s while the other one obviously wasn't <br/><br/>But the major problem with AP is that it tries far too hard to be clever . Despite the slow start once Patrick Bateman ( Played by Christian Bale doing a mean Jim Carrey impersonation ) starts bumping off people he doesn't like my attention was held except for a couple of details . When Bateman drags the body of Paul Allen through a busy concourse he leaves a trail of blood which nobody notices . That's detail number one while detail number two is when he chases the prostitute through his apartment block without again nobody noticing he kills her in an unlikely sequence by throwing the chainsaw over a flight of stairs . This got me thinking as to how no one notices his slaughter of innocents . I mean it's obvious the cops are onto him and yet no one notices the mounting death toll . Could it be that he's imagining it all ? By letting the cat out of the bag too soon with these two sequences from Mary Herron I was able to work out by the time he blows up a couple of NYPD patrol cars that Bateman's frustration in life is causing him to be deluded well before the final scenes . Did I say this movie was trying to be too clever ? Maybe I should say too confusing because it insinuates that Patrick Bateman is Paul Allen , or is a figment of Paul Allen's imagination . Duh. Whatever . Considering the very overrated FIGHT CLUB which came out round about the same time has a similar plot twist at the end AP's positives are dimmed even further by comparison <br/><br/>Five out of ten"

","When I first saw this in the cinema in April 2000 I hated it. But I watched it with the wrong attitude. I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions. He is Patrick Bateman. And fitting in/looking normal/being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life. But murder, misogyny, degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for. It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so.<br/><br/>American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy?<br/><br/>Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.<br/><br/>The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. The extras (apart from the deleted scenes), unfortunately, are pathetic.e movie with a scene of Bateman discussing his morning facial cream routine) that the point of the satire is nearly lost: Without the fickle trends of society, Bateman is an empty shell. Save his greed and bloodlust, he is a robot.<br/><br/>Harron tones down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome; the scene where Bateman, nude and bloody, chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the ""Me Decade"" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>Despite a lame ""Is Patrick really nutso?"" twist that hurts the movie, the point is not lost here, and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on her hands.<br/><br/>Bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to. Whether he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic, Bale is mesmerizing. If there's any justice in the world, Patrick Bateman will be a career maker.<br/><br/>Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well. With the exception of Matt Ross, who steals his scenes as a homosexual co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation, all other actors are window dressing. Witherspoon's role is written so blandly anybody could have played it, while Sevigny is incredible annoying as her characer moons over Patrick. Willem Dafoe is amiable enough as a detective investigating one of Bateman's crimes, but ... this is Bale's movie.<br/><br/>It's a wild ride that gets a little hazy in parts, but is certainly enjoyable in most places."

","This might just be the most overrated film I have ever seen in my entire life. I am trying to think of something this tedious -- oh wait, Synecdoche. That was worse. But I actually think that the secret to that film was that the only way to understand it was to reject its abysmal navel-gazing and walk out of it. Which I did. And if you sat and watched to the end, you didn't get it. So in that bit of turnabout, that film earned its ticket price. <br/><br/>This had no redeeming value that I could see. The one positive thing I can say about this is that I find Christian Bale's weird, stiff inability to act grating in pretty much every film I have seen him in, so maybe if they had hired someone else, this movie wouldn't have sucked such gangrenous boils. But I just don't get what's interesting about this film that these other people see.

Audience does not know what to expect. I would say the whole story is comparable to a movie like ""The Great Gatsby"" a pointless body of motion picture trying to lure audience with scenes of ultra rich extravaganza! Movie is mostly talking heads with limited action, 75%+ of the movie is plain exposition, explaining everything but something relevant to the movie, absolutely nothing to root for. OK, it is a motion picture about the daily life of a rich psycho who kills people... so what? What is the message? What is the resolve? Where is the structure? Screenplay never followed the approved Hollywood guidelines, one simple flat line from start to finish so I wonder how did it pass the studio executives into production. The exposition was so weak that the audience may not realize that the movie occurs in late 80s not early 2000s, apparently the director assumed that everybody read the book and now wishes to see it on big screen. I barely finished the movie, it was pure waste of time and I do not recommend anybody to waste her time!"
"haydenluz","10","4","5","11 April 2020"," American Psycho
","Mary Harron's depiction of Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho, is a true, original MASTERPIECE! The most beautiful part about this movie, was the ambiguous approach Mary Harron took. Her direction and story telling had a dark comedic tone, with so many open ended outcomes, having great detailed narration from Christian Bale. She also utilized a lot of foreshadowing, allowing things to really brew up into a fantastic story. Mary Harron used a lot of focused, close up shots, to really display the raw emotions in each character.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is an actor, man. I personally connected with a side of his character, because of my OCD nature, quick, sly remarks, and my blunt tone (just not to his extreme). His character is a real narcissist jerk, that is super high octane. Christian Bale did a phenomenal job getting into this role, working out, and really filling the role as an inside psychopath. He paid close attention to detail, really displaying, and explaining the true characteristics of a psychopath. The fact that Bale didn't get nominated for his performance, is a little absurd, considering this is one of his BEST performances. This was mainly a character study of Patrick Bateman, but we also had a lot of great performances across the board, for the supporting cast in Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis and more.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner was terrific! They really focused on making this a dark comedy movie, along with the drama/thriller/horror aspect. All of the dialogues had so much intelligent word play, having countless uncensored vulgar conversations, with many righteous remarks. Though there are some scenes that are genuinely horrific, Harron & Turner didn't shy away from incorporating consistent dark humor laughs, that came from the soul.<br/><br/>The action was brilliantly utilized, not overdoing it, being very graphic and unsettling. The way Mary Harron ties all the action in, in the final act, left my jaw on the floor, and made me rethink everything!"

","""American Psycho"" is a very clever adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's cult novel. There are very gruesome murders in the film, but you never get to see them which I am grateful for. The Patrick Bateman of this film (brilliantly portrayed by Christian Bale) is not the Bateman I imagined while reading the book, I don't know why, but the Bateman I saw before me was more cool and distanced. However, I like this Bateman better (as a character in a film/book, not as a personality) and Bale really brings something special to the part. Truly a great performance. Other than that, prepare to laugh a lot while watching the film. It's a satire and it's *very* funny. For example, Bateman's monologues about music before he kills and some very funny scenes involving business cards et cetera et cetera. However, it isn't a masterpiece and while it's a good film I still feel there's something missing. I don't know what, though, but I'll have to give ""American Psycho"" a 6 out of 10 = good."

"RockPortReview","10","7","11","6 February 2010"," Dead on satire of the 80's blended in to horror/comedy!
","American Psycho 02/02/2010<br/><br/>American Psycho is based on the insanely gory and controversial book by Brett Easton Ellis. The author has had several of his books made into movies such as ""Less than Zero"", ""Rules of Attraction"", and 2009's ""The Informers"". American Psycho is a book some thought to be unfilmable, but writer and director Mary Harron brought the vile character of Patrick Bateman to life in movie that is more of a dark comedy than your average horror movie.<br/><br/>Harron was also able to get such name actors as Reese Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto. Not to mention Christian Bale, a largely unknown actor at the time, who landing the role of Patrick. Although Bale has been acting since the late 80's in such films as ""Newsies"" and ""Swing Kids"", it wasn't until ""Psycho"" that he really started to appear on people's radar. His performance was nothing short of spectacular. If you really want to see a shocking comparison of his work, watch ""The Machinist"" and ""Batman Begins"" back to back. Bale is a man fiercely loyal and committed to his craft.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1980's New York financial district, American Psycho is a vicious satire on 80's materialism and extreme narcissism. Patrick Bateman is an investment banker for Pierce & Pierce, where everybody looks the same and it's all about how big your ego is. In an early scene we see Patrick, in his high rise apartment, go though his morning routine and in a voice over he says, ""There is an idea of a Patrick Batemen, but I'm simply not there"" If there is any emotion Patrick shows its greed and disgust. When his nightly blood lust starts to take over and he states ""my mask of sanity is about to slip."" He is sent over the edge by a business card. All the guys are showing off their new cards when colleague Paul Allen sends Patrick into a panic with a card that is better than his. This cannot stand and Paul eventually gets and axe to the face.<br/><br/>To fill out the 80's vibe there is a lot of hit music played and talked about during some of most important scenes in the film. Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston to name a few.<br/><br/>Reese Witherspoon has a small part as Evelyn, Patrick's so-called girlfriend, who is always badgering him to get married. Patrick really couldn't care less about her and is only going out with her to ""fit in"". Besides he has a mistress named Courtney. Jean his secretary is the most down to earth and ""real"" person in the film and in Patrick's life. Jean agrees to dinner with him, but at his apartment he can't go through with killing her and tells her to leave. Although when it comes to prostitutes he has no problem killing them. In one of the most insanely crazy scenes I've ever seen, Patrick fully nude and covered in blood chases a prostitute through his apartment building with a chainsaw. Bale completely inhabits this role and is totally insane. The final third of the film shows that Patrick has completely lost it and bears his soul to his lawyer's answering machine. What happens the next morning really drives home the themes of the film. <br/><br/>The novel is extremely explicit in the violence and gore, while the film mostly leaves it to your imagination. The real horror comes from the character of Patrick Bateman, who seems to channel Hannibal Lecter in some scenes. There was an absolutely dreadful sequel made in 2002. It didn't have any of the cast and crew from the original and is just pure trash. The original film made my list for best films of the decade for the 2000's and continues to be one of my personal favorite films."

","Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman who is a stockbroker, a successful stockbroker, in the eighties!! What does that mean? The sky was the limit!! BMW's and $180.00 bottles of wine were everyday tokens of a very leveraged period of economic expansion!! The titillating taste of raw capitalism made Patrick Bateman morally oblivious to the lethal consequences of his reckless actions!! It was all about chic restaurants that were approved by the New York Times, and, sexual proclivities which satiated Bateman's immediate hedonistic desires!! No, he was not telling a six year old kid who was looking at a plate full of mixed vegetables to ""Don't just stare at it, eat it"" .. You'll have to watch the movie!!<br/><br/>Here are the ground rules to the 1980's, be a smashing success in the stock market, and, as a result, be a serial killer!! Makes sense to me!! These self centered obsessions now materialized as a 24/7 preoccupation for Patrick Bateman.. His callous fruition had no tolerance for the mundane, was this illogical? For the real world, yes, for Bateman, of course not!! This film gives the movie audience an enticing invitation to the irrational thought patterns of Patrick Bateman.. I took them up on it, and indulged the entire film with a sort of heinous empathy for Christian Bale's character. I totally understood that he was the American psycho who had an intensely high testosterone level which was motivated by an exhilarating avariciousness!! The rationale being, ""I work out"" ""I make $250,000.00 a year"", I am always seen at the right places, and last, but certainly not least, ""I live in New York""... Do all of these things make me better? YES!!!.. SO NOW!!! My favorite hobby is being a very creative and utterly unmitigated assassin!!!<br/><br/>The eighties were great times, the ""greed is good"" philosophy was predominant, everyone was incredibly self centered, (I'm just being honest!!) It became a competitive instance of which people were better at it!!! Sort of like now, only today, it is a concept that is not all that new to us!! The film ""American Psycho"" translates to unscrupulous chicanery being the end result of a nauseating arrogance... All of us are human, we fall prey to personal motives and pecuniary fixations, it is just a matter of which people have the proper credentials to implement these desires the most expeditiously!! The 1980's YUPPIE tenet perennially professed the concept of ""Take the term Wall Street Mogul seriously, or, be bludgeoned to death!!!"" They were kidding, but, only a little!!!<br/><br/>The movie ""American Psycho"" is extremely well written, and evokes an exaggerated camaraderie with the prosperity of the eighties!! Christian Bale's acting performance in this movie is one of the best performances I have ever seen!! His perceived superiority was his convoluted form of amelioration!! Think about it this way, people can raise a family on less than $40,000.00 a year, but, they find a cuss word offensive? The same might hold true in the case of Patrick Bateman's covert vindication for his antics of absolute depravity and blatant disregard for human life!! How do these two statements correlate? They are directly related to the proverbial perception of hoof beats meaning zebras and not horses!!! I for one got caught up in the moment, and NO!! I am not seeing a shrink!!! Only because I cannot afford one, I am unemployed!!!<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" gets five stars and a perfect ten!!! I love films that make you look in the mirror!! Without question!! Your dark side is alive and well, ultimately, you must make the volatile decision as to what extent this insidious monster prevails!!! If Americans were not afflicted by materialism and vanity, the movie industry would go bust!!!"

","If I'm honest, I'm only here for Huey Lewis. Just kidding... although I do love Huey Lewis. I do love this film too though. It's a rare occasion where I like the film as much as it's source, maybe even more than. Easton Ellis' book is a masterpiece, even more gruesome than what's committed to screen here, but what it doesn't have is Christian Bale. He's on fire here, my favourite performance (he's also great in The Machinist and Le Mans 66). Here though, as Patrick Bateman, the meticulous psychopathic yuppie, he's magnificent. Bateman is cinematic gold, good looking, successful, intelligent and articulate. He's also a stone cold, calculating killer. For an 80s yuppie, that most loathsome of sets, he's oddly captivating, every bit the anti-hero. Narrating as he goes, Bale's voice sounding unnervingly like Easton Ellis... or maybe Easton Ellis sounds like Bale?... or Bateman! Anyway, perhaps it's the world in which he operates and it's depiction that makes this work so well. Hyper-stylised restaurants with pretentious names, minimal apartment layouts, the obsessing over business cards and Bateman's desire to fit in, but his competitiveness not allowing him to do so. This all provides a sleek clean surface for Bateman to cover in blood with devastating effect. He's annoyingly likeable... until he kills a homeless man and his dog. However on the flip side, minutes later, it's Huey time! Gleaming Axe, transparent raincoat and the idiot Jared Leto lured back to Bateman's apartment. Paul Allen (Leto) you see has upset Bateman. He has a better haircut, can get reservations at in vogue restaurant Dorsia, even has a better business card and mistakes him for someone else, as do several others. He's in trouble and it's not long until he's hacked to pieces as 'Hip to be Square' blasts out. This though might be his undoing as private detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is drafted in to find Allen and harass Bateman. He knows something's up, that unmistakable smile meeting Bateman's pouting frown, but their exchanges are more awkward than anything else. It's an odd film, no one is likeable to any degree, sexist Wall Street morons, drugged up socialites. Everyone is vile. There's very little thread to it either, aside Bateman's insecurities. Even the persistent detective feels like a nuisance sub plot to the killing spree. Ultimately it's Bateman's slip into more and more extreme and sadistic behaviour that drives this, with the sight of him running naked and blood splattered through the hallway with a chainsaw and him sweating profusely in designer suits as the minutes pass by being the more notable events. Bateman knows he's coming apart, but his lack of emotions confuse him. As he slides further it's difficult to get a grip if events are real or part of his deepening psychosis. It's chilling in it's pointlessness, but fantastic and makes me want to pick up the book again, but first... I have to return some videotapes."

The story is well executed, and by far well written with a tight sense of atmosphere and direction that perfectly builds on suspense and tension in more interesting ways than one. The film does seem to struggle to find a conclusion, but provides some interesting commentary on society and the business world in general, that is by far thought-provoking. In the end, however, the film is uniquely different in more ways than one.

No. I love it by every little tiny piece it exists off.
I love every frame, every sound, every dialogue, every character and every situation they find themselves in. Just every little detail you'll find after watching it for the twentieth time and still don't got bored by it.
I love the absurdity the world is displayed with and how it still remindes us of the hypocritical western civilization we live in. (especially nowadays with all that social media stuff going on)
To me the reason why this movie doesn't bore me, no matter how often I watch it, is that, just like Patrick Bateman says in the movie, it is an idea it doesn't really exist but it's an projection of something we all can more or less relate to. I really don't know anybody that doesn't think the world around him is going crazy from time to time.
And all though of course the average person doesn't walk around killing people and feeding stray cats to ATMs we nevertheless all built this ""American Psycho"" persona in our head to cope with all that's going on around us and at least somehow gain control over it. Even though this control is just an illusion in our head. The question to me is: how much of this psycho in our heads is in our real selves?

","I haven't read the book, and opinion is divided on whether it's better than the movie or not, but personally I don't want to read the book because I don't want anything different. The book is ambiguous as to whether Patrick Bateman actually carries out his crimes (i.e. he's a psycho) or not (i.e. he hallucinated or dreamed them), leaning towards the former, but the movie is definitely on the side of the paranoid schizophrenia theory. All the crimes take place at night and most of them feature elements that are utterly improbable, such as managing to hit a running person in the back with a chainsaw by dropping it several floors down a spiral staircase, managing to drag a body-bag trailing blood through a staffed foyer and out onto the street without anyone noticing, and managing to wipe out two armed patrol units and their cars (blowing them up) using a pistol loaded with a single magazine while not even taking a graze.
Therefore, I have always approached this movie as a satire rather than a horror, with the protagonist being one to pity rather than to despise. As such, I believe it is far more rewarding and entertaining than it would be otherwise.
Opinion will always be divided on this movie, as it still leaves some ambiguity in terms of where reality stops and Bateman's imagination begins.
Whatever the case, this is a movie that everyone should see at least once, if only to decide for one's self, but more so because it is visually stunning, with faultless and compelling direction, perspicacious script and realistic characterization."

","A revolutionary classic in the psychological thriller genre, with a career defining performance by Christian Bale(the role that led to his most famous role as Batman, can see why)<br/><br/>Its one of those few movies that messes with your mind but doesn't ruin the movie, too many modern movies go over the top with their jumbled up plots, this movie gets its spot on.<br/><br/>You truly don't know if Patrick Bateman has carried out the insane murders or not, director Mary Harmon really confuses our mind to not know if Bateman has imagined it all, some of it or did kill all those people.<br/><br/>Bale is jaw dropping tbh and its his master-fall display that adds to whether he is a psycho, a great storyteller or is a bit of both. He also a lot of the time is down right hysterical, even in murderous rampage moments, strong sexual scenes or any other part, his Bateman will have you chuckling along frequently. His urge to keep returning videotapes, his incredible knowledge of pop music and no desire to do any work(and his love of a pristine identity card)are other standouts plus I have never seen as funny a dance to a Huey Lewis song as he did here(which led to the movie's most brutal and memorable death scene, Batman kills The Joker so to speak).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast including Willem Dafoe, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Samantha Mathis and Josh Lucas back up Bale brilliantly, with all getting their own time to shine, plus all at times seems to be as oddball like as Bale's Bateman. Also the lovely Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's receptionist Jean seems to be one of the few that Bateman actually likes(he intends to kill her but works out he can't, whether that means he was going to or not remains to be seen, I think he was in love with her), Chloe is very beautiful, kind and sweet as Jean.<br/><br/>The movie is very violent and gore soaked in places(and doesn't hold back on animal cruelty, even if its mainly off screen)plus if Bateman was carrying out the crimes then all the other characters must be either very dim or know about what he does and they don't care about it, which is a bit weird even for this movie. Also Reese is great but a bit wasted, her talents should of been put to better use, same goes for Mathis and Leto. Whilst the sexual moments are a bit much at times, even if some are done with dark humour attached to them.<br/><br/>This though is one of the very best psychological thrillers of all time IMO with a endless supply of iconic moments, scenes and funny lines plus a real brain thinker after you have watched it, making you think about it a lot after watching it. Led by a Oscar worthy Bale as a monster for the ages(or is he)and a terrific supporting cast, American Psycho is absolutely superb."

","Holy hell <br/><br/>I've seen three truly great character studies in my life. A clockwork Orange, there will be blood, and one film that combines the best elements of both... American Psycho. I am having a very hard time looking where to begin on this, beside the obvious, but I'll leave that for last. The cinematography is subtle and meaningful. The soundtrack is electric and complements the dark comedy incredibly well. All of the performances are great. But the two things that make this great are the satire and Bale as the lead. This film is able to make a mockery of 1980s consumerism and the elite of the world in such a hilarious way that if nothing else, this movie is effectively a parody. But Bale is really the one who ties it all together. Without spoiling anything, he is able to play essentially a new character in every scene, feeling like an alien trying to react to social interactions like a Normal person would, but when you get those quick glimpses into the real Patrick Bateman... oh man. I'm not gonna go into much more detail, just please check it out asap. Last I checked, it was free on Hulu in the USA, and only $3 to rent on Amazon and iTunes."

The descent of American values in recent decades, and the poignant examination of such trends is what is truly distubing about this film. That, or the scores of mindless fools who just didn't 'get it'. Maybe because the truth has a learning curve greater than zero (or less than?).<br/><br/>Some see American Psycho as little more than a satire about materialism, and they're correct, but only in part. American Psycho, if you watch (or read it) closely, is much more than that. It is really an indemnification of what America has become. Bret Easton Ellis is quite possibly a patriot in this regard, for he sees the realities of this fading Republic and shows us all, in vivid fashion, the hideous and despicable qualities that have risen to dominance in our culture today.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is the embodiment of modern America. Our obsessions, our fears, our indulgences, our sins, our utter despair.<br/><br/>Unless we learn to face these realities, there is little chance of correcting them.

Those other slasher flicks have a story line and a motive and you know not to take them seriously, but 'American Psycho' wants to be taken seriously and send across a message or something. It's stupid, boring and the story (not that there is much of one) is never fully explained. In the end I just sat there thinking well this is the biggest waste of time. It's confusing and the murder and sex scenes are just there for the heck of it - hoping that it might hold your attention. I watched this film fall further and further apart and I hoped that at the end it might all come together but I was too hopeful, obviously. It's a meaningless, for the heck of it movie and I would never even dream of recommending it to someone unless I wished them to suffer in the same way I did.

","This movie is very strange. It's about a stock broker who's a serial killer at night. It's also about the social life of stock brokers, in the late 80's. The main character, Patrick Bateman, constantly excuses himself out of any situation that he doesn't completely control, and is, as all the other stock brokers in the movie, incredibly vain. He's cold and possesses no emotions at all. At the end of the movie, there is a weird twist, that turns everything that has happened up to that point around; apparently, none of it actually happened, and was all a part of Bateman's overactive psychotic imagination. On the other hand, maybe it isn't. There are a lot of different theories, but it all boils down to two possibilities; either everything happened, and no one cares, everyone is indifferent to the fact that the main character has killed an unbelievable amount of people, or none of it happened, but was just something that Bateman imagined, thought about, fantasized about. I can't decide which to believe, as there is evidence to support both theories. The movie is very weird; I've seen it four times, and I still don't really understand it. Whether it's because I'm too ignorant to understand it, or the fault lies on the director, for making it too strange, I don't know. 6/10"
"nycritic","10","5","8","3 June 2007"," Who is Patrick Bateman?
","There is an interesting moment during an early part of Mary Harron's controversial black horror comedy American PSYCHO that truly defines who Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is, even when hints are dropped here and there that not even Bateman himself knows who he is. As he goes through his ritual of self-pampering in the name of 'taking care of himself' much in the way cosmetic ads tells us to do, he removes an exfoliating mask from his face in a surprisingly slow way, pausing midway, as he looks at his reflection in the mirror. The camera does not flinch. What we get, for a good five to ten seconds, is the reptilian glare of a monster, a man so repulsive, so unwatchable, that he would make an excellent place as a Stephen King villain -- the Dark Man himself.<br/><br/>However, there is nothing 'dark' about Bateman. He lives in an ultra-swanky New York apartment, all white, an ode of minimalism at its finest. He dresses himself in the finest of fabrics (the book goes to extreme detail of describing just how much of a cult of the fashion-conscious Bateman and his peers are; indeed, all of them seem to dress and look the same and are often confused for one another), he works out obsessively, he admires how he looks, and he covets. Boy, he covets! It's only implied at first, but once the mention of getting that plum reservation at Dorsia -- the Newest Place to Dine At According to the Dining Bible That is Zagat Survey -- falls on the lap of a fellow co-worker, Paul Allen (Owen in the book), Batemen goes bonkers. Literally. (And that's not even going into how he reacts when he loses in the competition of who would have the best business card.) So. Paul Allen comes to his apartment to hang out and he winds out in the wrong end of Patrick Bateman's impossibly pristine, silver axe. The scene in itself is one of the most surreal, wickedly funny, and stomach churning I've ever seen. How Mary Harron constructs it: by having Bateman doing the moonwalk over a Huey Lewis song from 1987, ""Hip to be Square"" as he recited the importance about this song in pop culture while wearing a raincoat of sorts covering the length of his suit. It's disengaging, it's completely out of whack, but it's there, and it's neatly made movie history with its balls-out temerity and I love it. More so because a woman has directed it, and women aren't always given this chance to be this dark, this perverse.<br/><br/>American PSYCHO is visceral, though it tones it down a tad from the book -- in Bret Easton Ellis' outrageous story Patrick does even more unspeakable things to ex-girlfriend Bethany and late in the novel, to a boy and even then it's still squeamishly funny, while impossibly de Sadean. Guinevere Turner maintains the novel's essence to its core, and by also adhering to the novel's ambiguity -- since we never truly know what exactly happened, what did not, and there is the question of who Patrick Bateman really is -- she creates a wicked examination of reality versus the surreal, integrity versus collapse, the American values versus complete decadence. Oscar Wilde would probably love this story, would he be alive now: this is his own ""Picture of Dorian Grey"" taken to its furthest limits."

"ElMaruecan82","8","3","4","9 March 2020"," The dark side of vain masculinity, unveiled by Mary Harron ...
","I was 27 with high enough a salary to be a chain-dater, taking girls to the same expensive restaurants, especially one with the best panoramic view on Casablanca. My face became familiar to the waiters and they did a good job pretending it was my first ""visit"". I could bring girls regardless of any intentions to build a relationship; what mattered was the status. Two evenings could cost me a tenth of my salary but it was worth it. And that's the degree of vanity to which I could relate to Patrick Bateman, 26, embodying that point of a man's life where the more he eats, the hungrier he gets.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is set in the 80s but things haven't changed much; in the 2010s, we could all have a nice girlfriend and yet keep on lusting on that sexy profile on Facebook. Maybe the late twenties is an age where the manly ego roars too loudly to listen to reason, maybe there are so many possibilities that we're more likely to make decisions lingering on fantasies rather than reality, moreover in a time where sex is trivialized by porn and violence by pop-culture, which ""American Psycho"" shows (as opposite of ""tells"").<br/><br/>The film, adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel and directed by Mary Harron, is about that state of vanity driven to its more extreme and disturbing form. Here is Bateman's existential dilemma: should he surrender to the comfort of conformism at the risk of becoming a mediocrity (in his own terms) or acting free in the name of a supra-individuality that puts him above everyone else? The film is set during the Reagan-era and centers on arrogant yuppies who measure success by their capability to get the best tables, the most exotic meals and fulfill any kind of sexual fantasy. And Patrick Bateman is the most troubled of them: he's attractive, articulate but his moments of social adequacy are punctuated with anxiety driven by jealous rage.<br/><br/>But the weirdest aspect is less in his behavior than the way it keeps getting unnoticed. It's very telling that the final line of the film is ""That confession meant nothing"". Many movies tend to use violence to make a specific comment against society, channeling ""Taxi Driver"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" (there's even a scene that echoes Kubrick's film where Bateman confronts a homeless man) but in ""American Psycho"", violence says more about the perpetrator and the environment that can't perceive him as the degenerate man he is. It's not about the vanity of men who reached the top but the way they are seen as perfectly compatible with civilization although they're acting below animals, it's like a more cynical version of ""Being There"" with Peter Sellers.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" can also be regarded as an alternative to ""Fight Club"". In Fincher's film, men compensated the vacuity of their lives by uniting and draining their energy from their survival instinct, with a collective voice, and rejecting capitalism because it rejected humans in the first place. Harron's perspective shows men who exist individually, but whose existence are lead at the expenses of a social conscience, or any conception of love or family. It's all about consumption, competition, buying, eating, trading, a world where even women are treated like products whether prostitutes or strippers or disposable fiancées. These men didn't fight the system but embraced it, men being wolves to men.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman took it a bit too literally: anyone above him is a dead man, anyone who admires or loves his Alpha aura might get away, someone with no goal whatsoever, no philosophy of life, deserves to be killed. Destruction is what connects both ""Fight Club"" and ""American Psycho"" but if in the former, the mayhem was supposed to build a new order, the message was still contradicted by its homoerotic undertones and its constant gaze on Brad Pitt's beautiful abs. The film was tantalizing our voyeuristic tendencies. We get the same gaze on Bale, when he's taking a shower and narrates his cosmetic morning routine, but it's devoid of passion, it's cold and soulless and his naked body is often associated to scenes of horror that connects between the two worlds of fantasy: violence and nudity. It's just as if the real motive of the 'Fight Club' was to create a sense of belonging, to build a collective male body instead of restoring justice.<br/><br/>Mary Harron deconstructs the myth of masculinity through the portrayal of many metrosexual men as self-important and gossipy as the Beverly Hills housewives. Bateman has everything: a steady and gratifying job, a huge apartment in New York, a beautiful fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) and yet he's devoured by a constant urge to destroy whatever can spoil this feeling of perfection, even someone whose business card looks better. The film blends toward horror and comedy with rather gruesome episodes, but there's never any attenuating circumstance, Bateman has no moral alibi. He was raised by pop-culture, Reagan, and considers killing something as casual as ordering a hamburger.<br/><br/>It might be the extreme point from which we understand the inconceivable: why would someone who'd accept that thousands of people die from a transaction accept to be ethical? Why would someone who's at the top of the human pyramid, decides to have casual sex with an average Jane or accepts marital commitment? Why would he indulge to normal behavior? That's the point, the higher climb as a man and the looser will be your sense of moral, (look at the Weinstein or Epstein scandals) and maybe Bateman, whether he commits the actual crimes or dream of them, is the embodiment of both masculinity and capitalism dark side.<br/><br/>And Bale's extraordinary performance is crucial because he never tries to make his character sympathetic when he confronts us to our potential for degeneracy and hypocrisy. ""American Psycho"" is an underrated 2000s film, oddly prophetic, revealing new depths at each viewing."

The question is : Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...<br/><br/>The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality. People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Bateman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despair. It's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.<br/><br/>Highest Recommendation."

","In New York, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executive who is exceedingly vapid and vain, professes socially attractive beliefs that he doesn't believe in, generally dislikes his peers, is generally disliked by his peers, is regarded as lazy and a waste by those outside his social circle, dates an equally vapid and vain woman, and cheats on her with his peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) Patrick belongs to a subculture of wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executives, who are exceedingly vapid and vain, profess socially attractive beliefs that they don't believe in, generally dislike their peers, are generally disliked by their peers, are regarded as lazy and as wastes by those outside their social circle, date equally vapid and vain women, and cheat on them with their peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) They are all the same, so much so that they call each other by the wrong name. These wasters go to New York's finest clubs and restaurants every night, dabbling in expensive clothing, food, hair product, and cocaine. They discuss music and fashion advice. They waste away the hard earned fortunes of their parents without actually doing much work themselves. Nevertheless, they are all aware of one thing; they're better than you. Patrick however, is slightly different, and markets himself in a particular way. First of all he may be aware of how superficial and ridiculous this subculture is (though this does not change his participation in it.) And secondly, he may or may not be a serial killer. Perhaps desperate to find individuality in a world lacking it or perhaps severely ill, Patrick makes himself different from those around him by killing people. Anybody. Coworkers (especially if they make him insecure), the homeless, women off the street, security guards, anyone. Sometimes the motive is clear. Other times it's completely random. The movie and novel are told from his perspective so it's completely possible that he's imaging all of this and that it's not actually happening. The movie sometimes doesn't follow its own logic but this is all part of the appeal. I've heard people claim American Psycho to be a horror film. Certainly it has those kinds of elements but I'd call it more of a dark comedy. It has a dark, satirical comic edge to it. It's not for the faint of heart but generally speaking it's one to watch."

","American Psycho (2000)<br/><br/>This isn't quite a dark comedy, not a satire of psycho slasher movies, and not a straight up suspense crime flick, either. Or is it all these things?<br/><br/>It might depend on your sense of humor. If you try to take it seriously, which you shouldn't (the first clue is in the credits when the dripping blood turns out to be a red sauce for a fancy meal), you'll end up mystified and unhappy. If you find this funny, if Christian Bale in this pre-Batman demanding role is really wry and comic for you, you'll love it. Most of the time. <br/><br/>I was somewhere in the middle. Bale is playing a caricature--the overly rich and conceited playboy businessman in the Reagan 80s. But he plays too often the caricature directly rather than letting it come through the performance organically. Sometimes this is fine, or even great, but it puts a little strain on other scenes. (The women I know who saw it or have seen it don't think this matters so much because he's really hot, and really naked, in lots of it. And it's directed by a woman, Canadian Mary Harron who cut her teeth, not surprisingly, with the artsy ""Who Shot Andy Warhol."")<br/><br/>The plot is important and clever, and hard to talk about because there are some key twists, the twists becoming really huge by the end. Appropriately. Because above all this is camp. It's hammy without being slapstick. It works best, in a weird example, with the recurring fascination with the business cards among this group of young pampered business jerks. Jealousies over the color of the paper and the quality of the type lead to, well, some unrestrained behavior.<br/><br/>The movie is sometimes bloody for sure, but most of the blood is so gratuitous it isn't quite disturbing. The main character is insane as the title implies--more than you realize at first--and the people around him don't always see him for what he is. Or do they? Or do we?<br/><br/>There are a lot of movie tricks here. Scenes shift reality, or echoes from one situation visually resemble another, and in that sense it's a smartly made. But it also manipulates too openly for anyone trying to actually enter the movie. And ""entering' the movie is a mistake. It's all show, and once you realize it's a farce and the characters don't really matter because they don't really exist (it's just a movie, the movie insists), once you realize that you're going to enjoy it more, but also realize it's a capped off experience. It only goes so far.<br/><br/>By the end I wanted it to end. It's an odd, affected, curious, and almost period-defining movie.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I disliked this movie, not because it is intelligent but because it is a sophomoric bleaching of a powerful idea. That idea is that the FORM of the narrative should convey the MEANING of the story. In its simplest forms (Faulkner, Kafka) it deals with madness and what has come to be called the surreal. More subtle exercises in Joyce and Nabokov extend that to an emotional breadth and archetypal depth. But that results in hard work for the reader, so from time to time, lesser novelists recycle the idea at the high school level so that a larger and lazier readership can 'get' it.<br/><br/>Films have a harder time with this problem, because they work with a more constrained imagination, and have a tighter integration with societal semiotics. Still, we have some intelligent work with the idea. Greenaway is my own favorite, who incidentally doesn't shy away from the edge of violence as is done here. (Why? To preserve the comic stance? If so, the filmmaker is unwittingly like the society she portrays.).<br/><br/>One branch of the possibility of such ""wrapped"" films focuses on the actor, incidentally playing a character. That's the model attempted here. More mainstream recent film examples of how this is managed well are 'Sweet and Lowdown' and 'The Pledge.' The former creates a faux documentary narrator who imagines the subject. In this instance, the central actor pulls all the strings. A similar dynamic occurs with 'Pledge' where the wrapper is within the story (excluding the narrator). Easier to read.<br/><br/>A related problem is that Harron mistakes style in the costumes and actor's bearing for cinematic style. Really thin. This film is as lowbrow as 'Being John Malkovich,' cleverness for dummies. 'Fight Club' was more artful and intelligent, though it wasted its opportunity. The only intriguing element here is the probably unintended notion of Dafoe as an imagined Moriarty. This isn't taken anywhere, but Dafoe does have a haunting presence independent of this simple effort."

Or else it pretty much drops as dead as this one does.<br/><br/>It has two very good features: (1) the performances, especially Christian Bale's as the homicidal loony, and (2) the art direction. You've never seen such opulence, spare and shiny and sterile.<br/><br/>The problems lie with the script. It takes us through the days in the life of Patrick, who begins his mornings with some kind of horrifying bikini wax all over his face, then lounges around his office competing for nasty cracks with the rest of the boys, and ends up with mayhem of a particularly gory sort. <br/><br/>I couldn't put the climactic reveal through any kind of step-down transducer that made sense. You mean ""it was all a dream""? I didn't find the blood sickening but found the characters and their values to be enough to gag a maggot -- excepting the winsome Chloe Sevigny and Willem DaFoe's affably ironic detective. The rest of them were about as appalling as the characters in ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" Who wants to sit through such a parade of narcissism for two hours? Don't we get enough of that from Washington? <br/><br/>And this thing has been described as a comic/horror film. The phrase lends new meaning to the word ""comic"". What the hell is funny about it? Listening to Bateman's spiels about how deeply profound 1980s rock was? Is that funny? Or waltzing around in a plastic raincoat while preparing to chop a colleague into bits? Is THAT somehow amusing? Well. I'm kind of thinking it over and, yeah, I guess there is one comic element to the film. It's that it was taken seriously.<br/><br/>There's a moral lesson here though. Please take this down. Yes, it will be on the exam. A slasher movie doesn't become a good feature film just because you've spent a lot of money on it and based it on a best-selling novel.

What a boring old left-wing point to make. How original and insightful! We are presented with a psychopath who is supposed to be funny as well as menacing. To mix satire or even comedy with this genre is truly stupid and cannot come to any good. Plus, a couple of scenes are dumb in the ""Nightwatch"" or ""Copycat"" or even ""Hitcher"" vein: Bateman kills a fleeing hooker by throwing a running chainsaw down a flight of stairs - as if he spent all his life practicing for such an occasion. Of course, no one - in that large New York building - is there to see or hear the prostitute's screams or to see and hear a blood-soaked Bateman running through the hallways nude and with a chainsaw in his hands. (But perhaps the unfeeling, insensitive 80s are to blame and its selfish 80s inhabitants.) It is also unexplained how exactly he manages to clean the blood and drag the body up five or six floors to his flat without anyone seeing him and without leaving a bloody mess all over the place. But the nonsense doesn't end there. He also kills an old woman because she saw him pointing a gun at a cat (plenty of stray cats in Manhattan, of course) and after that he goes on a killing spree after which he weeps and confesses his crimes to a lawyer by phone. A psychopath with a guilty conscience?! Later, he meets the lawyer and tells him that he is Bateman and that the phone message was no joke, and that he killed the character Paul. To this the lawyer says that he had dinner with Paul twice in the last ten days! What the hell is that?? Did he imagine it all? Yet there is no indication at all that he imagined it all. And even if he had: what's the point?! Plus, he doesn't seem like the type of serial killer who would be dumb enough to try and kill his secretary, especially since a detective already hangs around him a lot.<br/><br/>It was clear to me from the very start of the preparations for the making of this movie that there was a lack of seriousness about it: they wanted Di Caprio to play the lead! Di Caprio the serial killer. No wonder the movie turned out so bad. Considering this, then maybe Bale wasn't such a bad choice. They actually fixed Bale's very English teeth so that they would look ""perfect"", i.e. yuppie-like, for the role. Instead, it looks as if he is wearing one of those very cheap, fake, bright-white vampire teeth (minus the fangs). <br/><br/>So what have we learned from this mess?

Nothing in the whole story bears any semblance to reality.

"MadReviewer","5","11","24","11 May 2001"," Delivers Some Shocks, But Ultimately Just Hollow And Boring
","Much like its contemporary ""Fight Club"", the film ""American Psycho"" attempts to express dissatisfaction with the status quo of modern society through shocking (and typically violent) means. However, while this intent can be applauded -- sometimes, it's good to shake things up a little -- the execution cannot. ""American Psycho"", for the most part, features unlikable, unsympathetic characters doing unlikable, unsympathetic things to one another, ultimately creating a film that's very difficult to care about . .. or to take seriously. <br/><br/>Based on the overrated novel by Bret Easton Ellis, ""American Psycho"" is the story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a young, handsome Wall Street stock broker who's finding it more and more difficult to deal with how utterly hypocritical and fake his life has become. He hates the world so much, he doesn't feel like a real person, so the only way he knows how to feel real is by committing acts of sadistic depravity -- rape, torture, and murder. The ironic thing is, Bateman doesn't try to cover his tracks particularly well -- he almost wants to get caught -- but no one else believes he's capable of such heinous acts; after all, how could such a young, good-looking successful man be such a monster? <br/><br/>The problem with ""American Psycho"" lies with the psycho himself -- Bateman. Christian Bale does an admirable job with the character, considering how badly the part is written, but the fact of the matter is that Bateman is never a particularly sympathetic protagonist. Yes, the people he tortures and kills are a bunch of unpleasant, two-faced hypocrites, but considering that Bateman is really no better than they are, there's no way of understanding, let alone condoning, his actions. He also has options besides becoming a serial killer, obvious (and more positive) options.  Think about it -- Bateman's been given more opportunities (money, friends, intelligence) than most people can ever even dream of in his life, and he chooses just to squander them as an Ed Gein-wannabe?  Come on.  Another problem is that Bateman is far too sane. He's nuts enough to think up some incredibly sick stuff to do to people, but he's rational enough to realize what he's doing is wrong. It may not have made him more sympathetic, but it might have made the character slightly more believable if he'd been crazier, thinking that his sick actions were just as rational as the mundane, boring things he did at work. (A subplot involving the idea that Bates isn't actually killing anybody -- all the murders are just in his head -- helps to make the film a little more believable, but not by much.) The result? One mean-spirited person kills a bunch of other mean-spirited people. Who cares?<br/><br/>
Visually, the film's fine. Director Mary Harron moves the film along at a smooth pace, flipping with great style between false notes of security and genuinely disturbing. However, since the disturbing elements are diluted by the fact that it's difficult to care at all about the characters involved in ""American Psycho"", some tremendous efforts in regards to cinematography and editing get wasted. Ditto the performance of the actors -- as mentioned above, Christian Bale is very good as Bates, Willem Dafoe is good as the criminally under-used private investigator Donald Kimball . . . but no actor or actress on the face of the Earth could ever make any these characters remotely interesting, likable, or for that matter, watchable.<br/><br/>
""American Psycho"" deserves some credit for trying to be daring, but it's ultimately an emotionally hollow film filled with some oddly gratuitous, clinically detached violence. Pass this one up. Grade: C-"

","How anyone can categorize this film as a masterpiece amazes me.  There was a perfect opportunity to develop a possible thrilling confrontation of Willem Dafoe's character and Patrick Batemen.

I'm embarrassed that I wasted this time trying to put some sort of meaning to such a lame film.  Just because the film makes fun of the self-centeredness of the '80s doesn't mean this is a good film.<br/><br/>What is more disturbing than the thought that someone would think this would be an interesting film is that someone thinks there should be a sequel!<br/><br/>I give this a -10 out of 10.

","American Psycho is set in New York where Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) the Vice President of a Wall Street banking firm enjoys a hugely successful life with a beautiful apartment, loads of money, the best clothes, the finest food & all the luxuries anyone could ever want. However under the calm & calculating exterior Patrick has psychological problems as he has a violent blood-lust which he satisfies by killing people he has contempt for & he also likes perverted sex sessions with prostitutes (then again who wouldn't?). His latest victim Paul Allen (Jared Leto) is missed & his fiancÃ© hires private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) to find him, will Patrick be exposed as the homicidal maniac that he is or can he get away with it...<br/><br/>This American Canadian co-production was co-written & directed by Mary Harron & I have to say that I didn't think that much of it despite it's reputation. The social satire laden script by Harron & Guinevere Turner who played Elisabeth the high class prostitute in the film was based on the controversial novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis & I just don't 'get' it's appeal or why anyone would particularly want to sit down & watch it, overall I think it's quite a dull & repetitive film with some nice dialogue & a few decent scenes which save it from total banality. Some of Bateman's monologues along with the amusing yet pointless speeches about the merits of 80's pop groups & the style of people's business cards are pretty funny at times if trivial & if your looking for some sex & nudity then American Psycho might do it for you. I was expecting more in the horror department if I'm honest, there's barely a drop of blood in it & certainly nothing graphic, pretty much all of the character's are very unlikeable & one dimensional with Willem Dafoe's cop getting about three scenes before he is completely dropped & I also thought it was boring with pretty much the same thing happening scene after scene. I wasn't impressed by the ambiguous ending either which tries to be clever but I just found it frustrating as it never clarifies if it was all in Bateman's imagination. Personally I didn't think it was anything to write home about but there does seem to be a lot of people out there who like it, so maybe I just went into it with the wrong expectations & quite simply it's just not for me.<br/><br/>Director Harron does OK, there's a nice elegance to the way this is shot with nice camera slick moves. The film nails the whole 80's yuppie thing very well as these unlikeable people spend money like water, care for nothing or no one but themselves & have beautiful apartments for which I'm very jealous. I found myself becoming bored with all the yuppie satire going on & again it just felt very repetitive. I wouldn't say there's anything scary here or even particularly that violent although there are a couple of fairly strong sex scenes.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 this looks nice enough with sleek & stylish cinematography but what does that matter when the film did so little for me? Set in New York it was actually mostly filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting is OK, I don't really know if I liked Christian Bale's performance or not. Willem Dafoe is utterly wasted in a nothing part.<br/><br/>American Psycho is trying to be a complex dark thriller which wants to say something about 80's upper class society in New York, I'm sorry but weren't the 80's like 20 years ago? I'm sure there are many out there who like or even love this film & I'm proud to say right here & now that I'm not one of them, average at best & an irrelevant bore at worst. Followed by the straight-to-video American Psycho 2: All American Girl (2002) which has no connection to this at all apart from a vague Patrick Bateman reference."
"bob the moo","Null","11","25","8 June 2003"," Not perfect but much better than the self indulgent book
","Patrick Bateman works on Wall Street for a major accounting firm.  He lives in a life that is material to the extreme and is more about where you can get reservations at than what you do with your life, where conversations never go deeper than music and the ultimate status symbol is the business card.  However Patrick Bateman is also a serial killer who mutilates colleagues, homeless people, call girls, anyone he can in order to try and feel something.  This film is his confession in his attempt to feel something.<br/><br/>I must be totally honest and say that I hated the book.  I hated it to the point that, although I normally take old books to a charity shop, I simply put this one in the bin after I had read it as I didn't want to be responsible for anyone else reading it.  The concept of the book was good and it made it's sole point within the first few chapters.  After this point it simply made the same point over and over and over again in a very thick book that seemed to take pleasure from writing about increasingly violent murders.  At the end of the book I sensed that the author had long forgotten the point he had set out to make and was more concerned with shocking or sickening me.  So when the film came out I simply ignored it as I didn't want any more of my cash to go to this hack.<br/><br/>However it came onto terrestrial tv recently and I thought I would give it a try, although I was ready to turn it off if I saw it going the same road. Surprisingly the film is good where the book was awful.  Both make the same point but one makes it in 90 minutes where the other makes it over hundreds of pages.  The film uses violence sparingly, mostly occurring off screen or in the imagination where the book lavished in it's increasing gore.  The effect of this is that the film is much more focused and controlled and works a lot better as a satire on the emptiness and shallow nature of our society.  It is set in the eighties but I feel it still applies today and Bateman could easily be any Western businessman whose concerns are so trivial on a global scale but so important to him/her.<br/><br/>The film doesn't labour this point but is able to pick the strongest parts of the book to good effect.  Of course it still isn't perfect and it may seem a little hollow to some (but that is the point I guess) and some may miss the point.  The fact that a sequel has been made that is a straight slasher movie suggests to me that a large section of the audience missed the boat totally.  The main reason this film worked for me was a perfectly cast Bale.  He is a perfect Bateman and is almost otherworldly in his delivery, getting the dead eyed look of Bateman perfectly and contrasting it with his excited chatter on music and his sheer disregard for everything but himself. The support cast is surprisingly well known (Lucas, Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe) but it is Bale's film all the way and easily one of his best performances.<br/><br/>Overall this film is not perfect and won't be to everyone's taste.  However just remember that I hated the book with a passion and I still liked the film.  The short running time makes for a more focused approach, the more controlled violence means it doesn't get distracted and a perfect performance from Bale keeps it all on track.  Much better than the horrid book from which it came."

","I think it is safe to say that almost everybody over the age of 25 has at least heard of the film ""American Psycho"" and so so many have also seen it I am sure. I myself have not until today, so I was certainly curious how this one would turn out. The film runs for slightly under 100 minutes (including credits) and was made back in 2000, so not too long anymore until it has its 20th anniversary. This is the most known work for most of the people involved in the making here, especially director Mary Harron, who is also one of the two writers who adapted the Bret Easton Ellis novel. And even with Bale having the Batman movies in his body of work and an Oscar for a boxing movie, there are still many people who think his turn as Patrick Bateman is still his career-defining role. The character's name said something even to me without having seen this film.<br/><br/>But I must say that ultimately I was very disappointed. Bale is an actor who always gives it his everything and the result is that sometimes he is just tremendously good, but on other occasions he is also off the mark and slightly on the hammy side and there were moments like that in ""American Psycho"" too, for example in the one shot with all the blood splatter that reminded me the television show ""Dexter"". Anyway, I still think he elevated the material overall here and is one of the better components. The film itself is a mess in terms of the script at times especially. I think the best moments were probably all the ones in Bateman's apartment and I am not just talking about the bloody murder sequences, but also the conversations. Bateman seems like a cold-blooded killer at times, but then you also feel that it is inside him and that he tries to fight it even, for example when he tries to protect his assistant from the beast that he is. And even if he killed several male characters, especially early on, he is a complete misogynist and I am not somebody who uses this term lightly. Just remember the ""head on a stick"" quote or so. That even shocked the other bankers at his table.<br/><br/>Anyway, people who like Bale will probably enjoy this film more than usual. I personally also like Witherspoon, Dafoe and Leto for example and I felt that this trio was so underused and wasted in here. Of course, you can make a point that it is all about Bateman, but still. Dafoe's character is the best example. He seems to smell something is wrong with our ""hero"" here, but it's not about arresting Bateman, not even after the confession and the best example is how the film ends. The very last shot. I will not go into detail about this one any more. You will know what I mean when you see it. Anyway, overall very little is really memorable here apart from Bale's performance perhaps and the general subject. But there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of other films about serial killers out there that aren't worse to be honest. And these do not get 1% of the attention that this one here is getting. After watching this one, I can see why critics do not like it as much as general audiences. I think ""American Psycho"" is a really overseen movie (does that word exist? the opposite of underseen) and also very overrated. If you are among the very few who haven't seen it yet, I suggest you keep it that way. You really aren't missing too much."

","If there is a single movie that suffuses as the poster-child for the countless ""What was the point of that?"" movies, it's American Psycho. It's not necessary bad, it's just boring and pointless. It's the kind of movie that will leave the average person thinking about their laundry when the credits roll rather than the movie itself. In other blunter words, the movie is wholesale forgettable from opening to closing. If you know anything about real-life serial killers, or have seen any other cliché serial killer movie, you've seen this. Hundreds of times.<br/><br/>It opens up just like every other first-person narrative movie, and some lines even made me wonder if they were copied directly from Fight Club. Regardless of when the two original novels were written, I think this just proves the insane unoriginality of both.<br/><br/>Speaking of unoriginality, American Psycho is nothing but one long, bloated serial killer cliché with nothing to differentiate it from the countless others just like it. The main character is a mix of Hannibal Lector and your average no-name B-movie serial killer. He does exactly what every other serial killer ever does: kill, have sex, and kill having sex. He's a dull cliché with legs. (And a butt, if you want me to mention the constant immature use of rear nudity that has no point but to make the 13-year-old girls horny.) There is no real plot, just, as I said, kill and have sex, and that's the ""brilliant, masterful"" plotting that everyone is speaking of. Kill, sex, kill, sexI think we know what sells in America. That's why American Psycho is just so safe. It's a safe idea that has been used hundreds of timeskill, sexand was destine to get great reviews because it plays so safe. I think we've learned by now that safe movies get the critic's good scores, and safe movies sell. Am I really the only one who gets it? American Psycho is a movie for safe pansies who's idea of a ""brilliant, masterful"" plot is: kill, sex, kill.<br/><br/>But with all the killing, I was left wondering: where is all this gore everyone is speaking of? How is this gory? Every single kill is off-screen. I've seen low-budget 60's horror movies that show more gore on screen. There isn't a single moment of brutality. There is less blood on screen than your average TV show. Did I mention this movie plays it all 100% safe? If everything I just mentioned wasn't bad enough, let me move on to the boring factor. The entire run time is a long, drawn-out talking scene. It goes from one conversation scene to another, with less action than your average drama. Maybe that's because, no matter what you want to believe, American Psycho is a drama. It isn't a horror moviejust the idea of typing that makes me laughand it isn't an action movie. It's just a cliché, dull drama.<br/><br/>The only good I can manage to scrounger up: - Bale knows how to act. - The chainsaw scene was interesting.<br/><br/>Now, back to the bad for my conclusion. American Psycho is a safe, boring, cliché drama and nothing more. It has some humor, but it's all humor you've heard before. There is no intellectual meaning, unlike what some seem to think, and it isn't entertaining. It's so forgettable the exact thing I thought when the credits came on screen was: ""I need to order some pizza . . ."" and didn't even remember I watched it until I sat down to write this review the next morning. There are countless movies out there exactly like this, and I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person alive who even gets that there actually ARE interesting, entertaining, original movies out there to watch. Why did I waste my time on American Psycho? <br/><br/>0/10"

","Plainly put, this movie was horrible.  The attempt to satirize the greed of the 80's was neither original or well done.  What's lacking in this movie? Basically everything, but here's a quick outline:<br/><br/>Plot- Obviously the directors found no need for a plot to be included in this movie.<br/><br/>Acting- Bale will win an award for this one, I do agree.  But saying it will be an Oscar is absurd.  The only award he's going to win for this is a Razzie (Worst job of acting for the Year). Also, the movie as whole (assuming no other movie can equal it this year) should do at the Razzie's what American Beauty and Matrix combined did at the Oscar's.  The casting and acting for the other characters was horrible, but then again they weren't given much to work with.<br/><br/>Comedy- The only thing they semi-succeeded with was comedy in the movie, but not for the reasons they hoped.  While we were supposed to laugh at the depraved nature of the greedy man of the 80's, I instead found myself and the other 300 in the theater that didn't leave half way through (which about 100 did) laughing at how stupid the things he did were (beyond psychotic) and how useless many of the sex scenes, dialogue, etc. were.<br/><br/>Ending- Like plot, the directors found having an ending unnecessary.  I stayed in the theater (prescreen for University students) because I figured it would have a decent ending that might make me think and make the movie bearable.  Wishful thinking.<br/><br/>In summary, don't waste your money or your time on this movie in the regular or dollar theaters.  Once it gets past those in a month, don't rent it either.  Don't even watch it for free on HBO... your time has to be worth more than that.  Watch the cartoon network or dumbo or something.  The only time this movie might be worth watching is once the producers of Mystery Science Theater 3000 get their hands on it and make fun of it (see the worst 100 movies on IMDb for examples of how MST3K can make bad movies bearable). However, this movie is so grotesque at points, they probably can't show it on cable.  It's the Devil's Advocate with more useless sex and absolutely no plot."

I won't give it away, in case anyone is foolish enough to want to throw away 101 minutes of their life despite my warning), but the movie has a surprise twist at the end, which completely fails to make any sense whatsoever no matter how you interpret the movie or the annoyingly ambiguous ending. Christian Bale, as the title psycho, gives a performance that could have been an interesting skit for Jim Carrey on In Living Color but is completely wasted in this movie by Ms Harron.  Also wasted is an incredible cast which includes Bale, Willem Dafoe, Reese Witherspoon and Jared Leto.  This could be the worst movie you could possibly make with this talented cast.

Horror nowadays is basically bad acting, sprinkled with bits of gore and vulgar language. This horrible movement began with this film.<br/><br/>American Phsyco is about a 27 year-old business man named Patrick Bateman. Patrick is popular with his friends, drowns in women every night, dines at the most expensive restaurants and has a very nice business card.

The same thing happens every day. Patrick goes to work, barely conceals his psychopathic alter ego from his friends, picks up a whore, has sex and then kills the whore. Our reward? To see him do it all over again, except next time with different bland dialouge.<br/><br/>AP had potiental, and some bits are interesting. But the final product is quite a mess.

","American PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company. The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting boy Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage). Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the 'look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her. Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.<br/><br/>American PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance. It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","American Psycho the novel remains a controversial piece of literature. Though now it's considered to be a modern classic. American Psycho the film turns out to be much less controversial. That's because just about all the coarse language, sex and torture scenes weren't included. Instead director Mary Harron smartly focused on the novel's black comedy and character study. Christian Bale is fantastic in the lead role. Just watch his confession on the phone at the end of the film for proof. The looks he gives, the way he talks and moves, and his appearance are very good. In my opinion he's not quite the ideal Patrick Bateman but he comes very close. The murder chapters in the novel gave it an edge, made it more memorable. The exclusion of most of these murders from the film made the cinematic endeavour tamed in comparison. Let's face it, what's shown in the film isn't anything new for cinema. There are films that are much more disturbing and bloody than American Psycho. In any case the murders would have been hard and costly to film if they were included. With the film's minor budget and the controversy surrounding the novel these scenes weren't attempted. What surprised me most, however, was that fitting actors were cast in the supporting roles. They looked and acted the way they were supposed to. Reese Witherspoon played the role of Evelyn Williams. Very nice. Harron's direction turns out to be good as well. Most novel to film adaptations are junk, but here the results are quite good. Thankfully, Bateman's 1980s music reviews (Genesis, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis & The News) were incorporated into a few scenes. Not in their entirety obviously but some of the best parts are there. The film's comedy is very fine. The story's horror elements are what's best though. Bateman has many characteristics of 1980s society and modern society in general. That's what makes him so important; he just represents the extremes of what people think and how they act nowadays. Even if they don't like to admit it many people resemble Bateman in some way. The soundtrack is, for the most part, upbeat. Cinematographer Andrzej Sekula captured the New York scenery that was necessary. It's not an ideal-looking film set in the 1980s but it's not bad. American Psycho the film is not a bad companion piece to the novel. It's an intellectual horror film; one of the best horror films of the last decade in fact. I recommend it."

","American Psycho is one of my favorite films of all time. With Christian Bale's performance to the brilliant direction of Mary Harron, this film has gained the cult status it has deserved. Patrick Bateman lives an excessive but empty life as an investment banker who cares for nothing but himself, his looks and how he blends into society. I don't find this film as controversial as most people would make it out to be. It shows very little violence and it more so implies violence rather than show it. It is not Hostel or Saw. It is more like Funny Games. Something very realistic where showing absolutely no violence or the cause of violence is more terrifying than the actual act. This film becomes less terrifying and completely envelopes you into being completely floored and interested in Patrick Bateman and his line of thought. You don't need to feel sympathy for Bateman, nor should you. Only interest. Bateman truly is an enigma. This is the true meaning of a dark comedy. This is somewhat the real influence for my second favorite television show of all time, Dexter. So bleak and horrible, making you laugh made you feel almost uncomfortable with yourself.

Starting at a posh restaurant with his colleagues discussing the local works trends and social gossip do we get a picture of what working on Wall Street is like.<br/><br/>American Psycho is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel, and the author has clearly a colourful picture on the minds of the highly prestigious workmen in America. This screenplay is marvellous, owing to the fact that Bale's character is so well thought out; a protagonist to envy and to identify with. His work is tame; his colleagues are infuriating whilst his fiancée annoys the living daylights out of him. <br/><br/>But he continues down the same path owing to the fact he must project an important image; an image of power and success. The attitude of Bateman is quite remarkable. His self loving success driven mindset is staggering, and the Dark Knight actor is frankly remarkable in this role Many films of course look at social class workings or stereotypes. From the significant upbringing and destiny surrounding Eddie Murphy in Trading Places to the way strangers and criminals look at Sidney Poitier's cop in In the Heat of the Night but with this 2000 release, you get a significant feeling that the way you walk and talk generally affects you persona and your presentation to others, which arguably decides the fate of this film.<br/><br/>Bateman's constant conformity to the general high standards of Wall Street leave him wanting more and when he is at home watching porn, experimenting with face products or doing his exercise regimes, he descends into a world of madness, and this is where the film drives into exciting mystery.<br/><br/>After Paul Allen shows him a business card and forgets his name once too often, Bateman introduces him to his axe, and after this arguably frightening sequence, the character base is set and the expectancy to see Bateman's next move is anticipation of the highest degree.<br/><br/>Honestly even as the caped crusader Bale has never been more impressive. His depiction of this character is completely accurate and interesting. He derives from a standard of madness and makes it fascinating psychologically whilst oddly, surprisingly comic at various points. The character is a joy; a privilege to watch and observe and the madness may give Hamlet a run for his money. A must watch for the sheer brilliance of the character development and Bale's performance."

This may have been because of the fact that I built up my expectations too high, or because of the fact that this is a compelling theme that deserved more of an explanation and a more thorough study of Bateman's psyche than the film actually offered.<br/><br/>From the opening credits 'till somewhere halfway the story, i believed that this film had tremendous potential. Halfway trough the movie however, I was forced to revise this opinion, waiting for some explanations of what Bateman is doing or a deeper look into Batemans psyche and what is real and what imaginary. Instead, he just randomly kept murdering girls in random places (the apartment with all the corpses?), strange things happen (Paul Allen's apartment cleaned up all of the sudden by an accusing real estate agent?, Bateman going berserk without any consequences?, Bateman imagining drinking whiskey?) that make you understand that not all of what Bateman does is real, but no explanation is given for this, and we never get to know what in fact is real.<br/><br/>By the time I understood that Bateman was imagining certain things, I was hoping that this film would draw to a 'Fight Club ending' and a 'aha-erlebnis'.

This is one of the most quotable movies ever and I can't believe how funny it is. I guess the first time I watched I didn't get it for what it was: a satire. It's a satirical look at the materialism and excess of the 80's and I had not seen Oliver Stone's Wall Street before viewing American Psycho. Wall Street was the key to unlocking this movie for me. Sounds weird, doesn't it? But I swear that's what did it for me. Well, that and my love for Huey Lewis and the News. The film is packed with a star-studded cast, but it's Bale who makes a name for himself here. He is the whole show.

The violence isn't as graphic as in some Peckinpah films but the lead actor does a fine job celebrating his character's bloody hidden personality. That inside killer blends with his ""real"" persona toward the end till reality and fantasy merge-or were they always merged? Apparently so, as the ending makes it clear the only crimes committed were in his mind, the ultimate satire of a society concerned only with appearances. I can't say I recommend the movie to everyone but it did keep my attention for the most part. There are some clunky moments, especially with the investigator, whose last conversation with the lead probably should have been placed closer to the end of the film. The final clue to the truth of his madness was given by someone who carried no threat, therefore the impact of the message softened.

","In a world where appearances are everything and a man's status is determined by the typography, watermark, and paper quality of his business cards, lurks an empty shell of man, who is either falling deeper into madness or satisfying his intense blood lust through a series of brutal murders. Such is the ambiguity of this fascinating film that it easily stands up to repeated viewing if only to explore what is real and what is illusion. Patrick Bateman, who is a distant relative of Norman Bates in more than name, is a loner surrounded by people with whom he never relates. Although he does not hide from the world like Norman did, Patrick's icy facade, which has been conditioned and pomaded into a mask of normality, shields him from the world as effectively as the remote motel hid Norman. With his mask in place, Patrick Bateman intermingles in a world of interchangeable people, who vie with each other for social position through table reservations at trendy restaurants, the quality of a hair cut, or the fabric of a custom-tailored suit. Money flows from toil-less occupations in a New York milieu, where, as Gordon Gecko in ""Wall Street"" so aptly summed up, ""greed is good."" The Reagan era on steroids, although Bateman's peers comment negatively on the president as they watch him try to explain away the Iran-Contra scandal during a televised speech. The young men's remarks about lying are ironic, when their own lives of sham and deceit are considered.<br/><br/>But, under the glistening surfaces, like the depths explored by David Lynch in ""Blue Velvet,"" the being who is known as Patrick Bateman lives another life, possibly in his deteriorating mind or possibly in dark back alleys and designer apartments or possibly in both simultaneously. Simply put, Patrick does not like women, and he does not like rivals, and he is eager to dispense with both through his adept use of gleaming stainless-steel axes or state-of-the-art nail shooters. While Norman Bates had deep-seated problems with sex and evidently did not have physical relations with women, Patrick does have sex with women, who are often paid. Patrick's women become debased objects that he abuses, while he admires his own physique in the mirror. Even in the most intimate act of sex, Patrick does not relate with anyone other than himself. However, unlike Norman Bates, Patrick Bateman does not have a mother complex, in fact, he does not seem to have a mother or any family at all. He is a being with no past, no relationships, and no soul. The role is difficult, and Christian Bale as Bateman is outstanding. The perfection of his looks and physique make him physically ideal for the part. But his performance is more than surface sheen, and Bale disarms the viewer as he slowly escalates from a cool emotionless young professional into a psychotic as the character descends further into his own perverted delusions or manic blood lust. Bale's is a performance as ambiguous as the film.<br/><br/>The direction by Mary Harron is excellent as well. Harron wisely focuses on the satire inherent in the screenplay and downplays the violence, which is more often suggested than illustrated. Apparently, she has studied Hitchcock and knows that what the audience imagines can be far more powerful than what they actually see. ""American Psycho"" is a stimulating work that can provide fuel for heated discussion about what actually does or does not occur. Does the violence exist only in the pornographically violent doodles in Patrick's office agenda or did an unseen protector clean up the evidence of his series of murders? Or both? Like Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" the film swirls downward like dark water into a drain as Bateman is sucked further into madness, which eventually consumes his entire world and draws the viewer in with him."

Also, all the supporting characters weren't very interesting, way too superficial and clueless (even though that was probably the intent here, to show the superficial 80s). Anyways, seems to me that all of the supporting characters seemed forgettable except for the hooker that patrick liked to call ""kristy"", seemed to me she ""got him"" all along but kept it to herself since she had a ""job"" to do.<br/><br/>
Anyways, one good thing from this is that I look forward to seeing Christian in more films [and who could forget that body from heaven!]."

","Dull as anything could possibly be. Eighties materialism, psycho fascination and American sexual frustration of all kinds have been dealt with many times before this and in many, MANY better ways. Mary Harron's latest does, however, have Christian Bale's dead-on performance as Bret Easton Ellis' titular hero/villain and some nifty production design, not to mention a terrifyingly good performance by Samantha Mathis as a dope fiend who provides Bale with a regular friend-it's probably her best performance ever. The film caused much controversy involving activists and censors for its graphic violence and glorification of serial killers, but in the end it was all much ado about nothing: there isn't enough resembling humanity to be offensive, and it's all undone by an ending that renders the entire film completely invalid."
"Rammstein-2","5","2","3","30 May 2000"," My mind goes blank (spoiler warning!)
","I didn't feel anything when I saw this film. The book made me disgusted, furious, had me laughing and nodding in consent with the clever insights into the idiotic life of Patrick Bateman. This film had nothing of it, and it although it was a good movie, it's far from being anything more than average.<br/><br/>I won't say that I miss the endless torture-scenes of the book, it was clear right away that those were not possible to show to ANY extent. The mere suggestion of them and the notebook that Jean flips through near the end are enough to make one understand just how sick this person is. And Bates' performance is just excellent, perfect - he masters this role like none other. Just look at him phoning his lawyer: ""I just have to kill a lot of people!"" Brilliant.<br/><br/>But the blandness of this film is on another level: the director just fails to convey the sentiment of total detachment that Bateman feels. He interacts with people, talks to them and even feels something for them, as in the case of his girlfriend, whom he dumps so that he won't harm her. All this is okay, for he wouldn't pass for a normal human being if he didn't. He leads two lives. His ""normal"" life is okay, well portrayed, and the moments where his second life, that of the blood-thirsty maniac, tries to grab hold of his sanity, are well made.<br/><br/>But there is still something missing. And I can't really tell what. All I can say is that this film didn't make me feel what I thought I would feel: these people exist. There are people like Bateman, surely - but the film makes him unique.<br/><br/>So go see it, for all that it matters. But I'd much rather read the book."

","American Psycho elucidates that having strong and vibrant feelings towards things doesn't necessarily mean you are a ""Psycho"".

The way he was disappointed when Bryce favoured other card and how he was finally broken by Luis' business card. The way he let Reese Witherspoon let off because they were together for a long time.<br/><br/>The only thing the story doesn't give light enough is on the topic whether Bateman really killed others or not. The doorman, the prostitutes and that old lady outside the ATM machine. But, more than that I want to know whether he really killed that poor dog with the homeless man or was it just another of his ""drawings"".<br/><br/>In all, a tightly packed movie with some high points but other than that, it can be a good study but I think Dexter took the concept and made it to so much more. That is also based on book(s) and it was also based on a novel but I don't know how much it is accurate (I have not read the novel) but I am pretty sure the ending must be kind of different in the novel.

"asphyxion_","9","1","1","23 December 2019"," Excellent Self Indulgence that isn't so mindless
","I love American Psycho. It's excessive in every way: from the violence to the sexual situations and fantasies, to its blatant dialogue exchanges, to its senseless murderous rampaging violence, but mostly it's excessive in its malignant consumeristic narcissism. And one can't help but feel that the excessive narcissism is exactly the point of the entire film. It's almost as if the movie itself is an actual cinematic-embodiment of the personality disorder that Patrick Bateman so heavily suffers from. American Psycho also does an amazing job at encapsulating all the base desires of the male psyche, and then amplifying them in an almost poetic way to paint the perfect picture of who exactly Bateman is and just how insane he can truly be. And what makes the entire thing so effective is how easily possible the movie makes one realize that any man could be driven to be such an egotistical jacka$$ if given the right circumstances in life.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of subtle but perfect dark humor in the film. Especially the  contest that is the Business Card Show and Tell that the men engage in periodically. You'll notice how everyone is a ""Vice President"" -- an obvious jab at the crony corporate nepotism on Wall Street/big business and how the 'higher ups' are really just useless drones who do nothing. Case in point: Patrick telling his secretary to hold all his calls for the day because he'll be too swamped with work, but then immediately kicking his feet up on the desk and turning Jeopardy on on the television as soon as his secretary leaves the office and closes his door.<br/><br/>What surprises me the most about American Psycho is that it was directed and written by women. It's not that I think women are incapable of creating good movies, but more that the subject content of the film/script is drenched in testosterone and misogyny, so it ultimately feels like it was crafted by men. Then again, in retrospect it probably took a woman's touch to really show the absurdity of Bateman's extremely toxic masculinity and malignant narcissism in its absurdist and repugnant light. A male director/writer team probably would have made Bateman a more sympathetic egoist, and I'm sure that defeats the entire point of what the movie is really trying to say in the first place.<br/><br/>My only gripe with the film is with the casting of Bateman. Don't get me wrong, Christian Bale did an incredible job but its not without warranted criticism. Bateman's tangents into the ridiculous by way of prolific verbal dissertations on Huey Lewis and The News or Phil Collins, while freakin' hilarious, feel a little too forced. And that forced feeling is a consistent issue throughout the movie--Bateman's excessive egotism doesn't always feel natural, and it ultimately mars the film's immersion/continuity. I read a review that suggest Charlie Sheen as Patrick Bateman, and honestly I couldn't imagine a more perfect real-life egotistical maniac to portray Bateman. Charlie Sheen from Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" with Patrick Bateman's book personality would have been excellent here.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie doesn't really spoonfeed you a conclusion (although it gives you hints throughout the entire film) and so its ambiguity gives it a more intellectual bent to its portrayal of insane cathartic self indulgence. I'm of the mind that everything was in Bateman's head and he truly is crazy, but both sides of the argument have valid reasons for why they either do or do not believe Bateman really did what we saw on the screen. This and the fact that the movie clocks in at just a hair over 100 minutes and you've got a highly rewatchable piece of entertainment. 9/10 Solid A rating"
"david_rudy_lee","10","1","1","12 December 2019"," Amazing Performance of a Broken Mind
","This film I originally saw in college when one of my buddies put it on. I had no idea what it was and was just shocked with what I saw in such a good way. I think I've seen it a few times now and just now fully starting to understand it all. I had some theories, but it really took listening to others thoughts as well as those who have read the book for me to think I finally get everything. The synopsis is a wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), hides his alternative psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonist fantasies.<br/><br/>As it states, we follow Patrick who we never actually see do any work. He is engaged to marry Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but he doesn't love her. He actually has no emotion, as he states himself. He admits to really just going through the motions of trying to be human, but aside from flesh, blood and looking that way, he doesn't feel emotion aside from disgust and greed.<br/><br/>He has a close group of friends of Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), who Bale believes is sleeping with his fiancé. They also hang out the most together, doing a lot of drinking and drugs. There's also Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas) as well as David Van Patten (Bill Sage). They all work together at the same firm. Another guy they work with is Luis Carruthers (Matt Ross). He is odd and he is engaged to marry Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). She is having an affair with Patrick though. This group of people goes out to eat all the time at fancy restaurants, drink and do drugs, living a rich lifestyle, but all of them are out of touch with reality. The four men who hang out together are sexist and definitely pretentious.<br/><br/>Patrick tells us he's losing the mask of sanity. What doesn't help is his encounters with Paul Allen (Jared Leto). The first is that we get an odd measuring of ego by comparing business cards. Patrick then goes out to dinner with Paul, but he thinks that Patrick is actually someone else the whole time. It takes a dark turn when Patrick kills him with an ax.<br/><br/>This brings him into contact with Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe), a detective who is looking into the disappearance of Paul. Patrick is becoming more and more unhinged and has less control over his actions. The issue becomes though, who is Patrick Bateman and are what we seeing real or just in the mind of a psychopath?<br/><br/>As I've said now that I've seen this film a few times, I can see some interesting things that this film is addressing. The first is I've heard some people contend this is not a horror film. I most definitely feel that this falls into that category. We first have a psychopath that is on the edge of sanity that is going around killing people. Not all of this is done on screen, but it just has that dark feel about it. Seeing Patrick as he slips into madness is really something that is enjoyable.<br/><br/>From here I want to shift to the interesting idea that all of these male characters are pretty much the same person. Of course, they're not. We can see that each one of them is different, but none of them really have an identity. This last viewing was in the theater with my girlfriend and she pointed out that they all look the same. They all want to do the same exact things and it is really just showing they are a stereotype of these people from the 1980's and really have no personal thing to set them apart.<br/><br/>That moves to the point where since they're all so similar, no one can tell each other apart. Of course Patrick, Timothy, Craig and David all know each other, but Paul thinks that Patrick is someone else. Patrick talks to his lawyer at the end and thinks he's someone else and even thinks he went out to dinner with Paul. To take it farther, they're all sleeping with each other's fiancés and none of them seem to care about that either. They're just maintaining a lifestyle that they think they should. The final thing about them is that they're horribly pretentious as well as misogynistic.<br/><br/>I want to shift to this to the acting and going to have just a paragraph here dedicated to Bale. His performance here is unreal. I like that he does so well at showing at first how much of a sociopath that Patrick is. It is a lot like watching the show Dexter that came out after this, in that they both know they're really just doing what they can to get by. Seeing Patrick as the more he kills, the more he loses control. But in the end, we don't know if what he's done actually happened or not. I'm going to have a spoiler section at the bottom as to what I think happens here.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the acting, I think that Theroux, Lucas and Sage are all solid. They do well at pretty much mirroring each other which I dug. Chloë Sevigny has an interesting role as Jean, Patrick's secretary. She is attracted to him, which is fitting since she's into men who are available and just wants to be part of this world. Witherspoon and Mathias are also mirrors of each other which works. I have to a lot of credit to Dafoe, he's so good here. I love that his scenes were filmed with three different expressions of Kimball thinking Patrick didn't, thinking he's innocent and one of just not knowing, then just splicing them in to just make Patrick seem that unnerved when trying to read him. Ross, Leto and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.<br/><br/>That will shift me to the pacing of this film, which I think is good. It has a run time of around 100 minutes and to be honest, it doesn't feel like it. We just move through this descent into madness as it gets worse and worse. Seeing that no one around him really knows him makes it that much worse. Much like his descent, his acts of violence get progressively more aggressive as well. I really dig the ending and the implications of everything that we get there. It is both terrifying and kind of sickening as well.<br/><br/>The effects are really good. This isn't necessarily a gory film as a lot of what happens is off screen. What we do get though is blood that looks pretty real. We get to see some bodies, but only for a glimpse which works. The tension is built through seeing the build up and just how Patrick has no real touch with reality. It is shot very well to convey this also.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover here would the soundtrack. I love that Patrick is a connoisseur of music from the era. It seems out of place with the things that he's into, but he has dissected it in such a way that it is surgical. How he describes these songs before he commits violent acts is wonderful in bringing not only horror, but dread as well. I think that the score fits for what they needed for sure.<br/><br/>Now with that said, the more I see this film, the more I appreciate it. There's such a great character study of someone who seems to have it all, but has no touch with reality. Bale's acting in bringing Patrick to life is wonderful. He's accompanied by a solid cast as well. It is paced in a way where I don't find it boring and the ending is just great. The effects are really good, even though we necessarily don't get a lot. The soundtrack fits for what was needed. This is a film that really does benefit from multiple watches to really piece together everything that we are seeing here. This definitely a film I find to be great for sure. I would recommend to horror and non-horror fans alike to give this one a viewing for sure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My Rating: 10 out of 10<br/><br/><br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now what do I think happened. I think that Patrick murdered Paul as well as some of the other girls that he brought home including Christie (Cara Seymour) as well as Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner). I do believe the homeless man we see early on was murdered as well. Kimball is coming around to investigate the murder. I think though that the rampage Patrick goes on late in the film isn't really happening. He thinks he kills all those people, but he's just panicking and ends up back at his office. What works in his favor is that no one really knows anyone else, so his lawyer really does think he's someone else much like Paul thought he was someone else. I do think there really are murders is when they're showing Paul's apartment, the lady there has a look of dread and tells him to leave. Since it is an expensive place, they're covering it up as well. Patrick is going to get away with it for now since no one really knows who he is, including himself."

Truly magnificent acting performance by christian bale as american psycho signifies the rise of Christian Bale as an actor. Movies like these helped him with roles in Batman trilogy. It contains chilling and horrifying scenes where he feeds a stray cat into an ATM machine and murders a destitute vagrant in the dark allies. Truly excellent portrayal of a maniac who gets his kick by taking lives of people by gruesome means. Patrick Bateman cannot exist in real because no one will get off with the murders on the streets, people and cops would eventually notice. I am not sure whether they have made cult classics such as these in a decade. Because this was extremely satisfying and well made, some scenes are all time classics and already generated number of views and comments on youtube."

","The film does not take a gorey approach to murder, as some might assume. Christian Bale's role went beyond the topic of a crazed psychopath killer, but instead a materialistic hungry man surrounded by more materialistic hungry men. The film needs to be watched with a close eye in order to really comprehend its purpose.<br/><br/>I am not supportive of the idea of abuseing women and murder, and I feel that the film was directed in a way that did not support it, but did create a feeling of discomfort to its viewers on purpose, enough to present the hidden inner lining. That being said, I am a huge fan of controversy. If the viewer is not open-minded to alternative and innovative ideas, this film is not recommended. The controversial elements were used as a tool to promote a disgusting amount of excessiveness consumerism takes on the yuppie culture. I appreciate the subtle comedy and ballsiness the movie takes on. It is rated R, so I don't believe the impression that the film made can be replicated if it was for a more impressionable audience. The plot is not what really sold me on the beauty of the film. It felt under-developed, however the avant-garde themes are admirable. The flick gets in your face. It makes an impression."

","This is hard to watch at times. Patrick Bateman's cruelty is what is at issue: how is it motivated, from whence does it come, is it in everyone? At times this film seems to suggest that the unrestrained mayhem and viciousness displayed by the main character are present in all humans; and the social masks we wear are merely thin disguises for the aggression, greed, and cruelty which operate below the surface. The movie presents society as a tightly rehearsed dance of protocol, virtue signaling, discreet conformity to social norms. In one scene characters display business cards with subtle differences in what appears to be a critique of how restrictive society is that the only thing left to choice, the only mode of self expression is a water mark on a card, or raised lettering. When Patrick Bateman snaps it is a horror show of epic proportions. This is not easy material to render and the director deserves a lot of credit. Sexuality is presented as naked aggression, animal-level conduct divorced from sincere emotion or communication. Characters in this movie exist in profound isolation, unaware of their motives, operating at a level of seeking or maintaining status. If a darker vision of modern society exists on film I am not aware of it. Even Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' had a few moments of familial contentment, and an expression of love, which you won't find here. Not to suggest this movie needs any of that. It is a psychological study, a dark one at that; and if you are inclined to ponder the depths of what is inside the human animal this movie is ""food for thought."""

However, below this exterior, Bateman shows a twisted mind obsessed with murder and torture, a profile he struggles to hide throughout his everyday life.

There's nothing more entertaining than turning the lights out at night and watching a good scary movie. But my favorite kind of horror is psychological horror. You see, with psychological horror it's not about a monster, a masked killer, or a zombie apocalypse, but it's about the fear and horror within yourself and it also explores what drives someone to kill. One film that manages to take that concept and mixes with satirical 80s black comedy and ending up being, for the most part, devilishly clever, insane, and hilarious at the same time is American Psycho.<br/><br/>Based on the Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name, the story follows Patrick Bateman, who, by day he's a wealthy, but self-centered and materialistic stock broker in 1980s New York, but by night he's a bloodthirsty, psychopathic, and deranged serial killer who kills people to indulge his sadistic fantasies. But the line between reality and fantasy begin to blur as Patrick's dark side starts to reveal itself on his mask of seemingly outer perfection as his bloodlust rises.<br/><br/>While it's not really a straight up horror film, it's more like a character study of someone who, on the surface, may seem like he's literally living the Dream and has a lavish lifestyle, but, in reality, he's a lunatic who craves murder, torture, and sex. This movie also satirizes the 80s Yuppies culture; young and wealthy people who work high-end jobs, have dinner at lavish restaurants, and pretty much say or do whatever they want without any sort of repercussions.<br/><br/>However, it doesn't stray the focus away from the main character, thanks to its well-written screenplay. Much of the story is told from Patrick's point-of-view; he's obsessed with the lavish lifestyle; always trendy, always looking handsome, and living among the rich & elites, all this which hides his psychopathic dark side. But, at the same time, he despises it and often criticizes it for how shallow and soulless it can be, despite being obsessively indulged in it.<br/><br/>I especially do like the look of the film and how it feels like the period that took place at the time. Cinematography is also on point here, especially viewing which side of Patrick we're seeing. It can be calm and soothing when he is normal, but then becomes crazy when he goes ballistic and starts killing people with an ax, a nail gun, and a chainsaw. Editing moves the film at a steady pace and the soundtrack cleverly fits with both the setting and events that unfold. You'll never hear the song ""Hip to Be Square"" the same way again.<br/><br/>Lastly, the performances; they all do their parts well, but it's Christian Bale who is the real star as Patrick Bateman. This was the film that made Bale into a household name, and this was before he was Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy. It's amazing how committed an actor like Bale can be to match his physicality with the character's physical appearance as well as diving into the psyche of a psychopath.<br/><br/>Overall, American Psycho is an interesting blend of comedy, horror, and satire that just works. The only thing that I didn't like too much was the third act, which I feel is when it started to decline a bit. But the humor, the satire of yuppies culture of the 80s, the excellent direction, and Bale's performance makes this an underrated gem. Defiantly worth watching.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 9/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.<br/><br/>Now if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videotapes."

","American Psycho is a psychopathic movie, really. We have a crazy, dark and mysterious main character. Bale is awesome as Bateman. This character is such a deep person and every experience he goes through makes him deeper. Movie is so successful about making term descriptions and telling Bateman's mind. Also it goes in a serious tone and it makes us thrilled. American Psycho has bloodcurdling sequences. Story is not so clear, it left some questions behind of it. I think reading the book is necessary to understand everything better. I didn't but movie made me excited for reading it."
"ajdepola","10","1","1","13 January 2019"," I was blown away
","The film stars Patrick Bateman, a 27-year-old man who is a wealthy stock broker on wall street although we don't really see him work rather we see him going out to restaurants and other places as he hangs out with co-workers. The story is about Bateman going through life as you or I would but there's a catch; he's a serial killer, throughout the film we see Bateman kill random people and we also see the aftermath of some of his kills.<br/><br/>during the opening after a bar scene where he openly admits to wanting to kill a young woman who is bartending but she doesn't hear him due to the music being too loud we get a description of his day to day life. He mentions all of the skin care products he uses to look young his rigorous diet and exercise routine and even saying ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman"" so we can already tell he's not all there but seems like a normal guy on the outside.<br/><br/>The film is set on the 1980s so we see people openly snorting cocaine and smoking without any problems. What surprised me the most was when I found out a woman directed this film now I'm not trying to be sexist in fact I think anyone can direct a great film regardless of who you are but it shocked me because of how Bateman treats women. Along with the murders Bateman has women come to his house so he can have sex with them and he even films a session with him flexing at his muscles in the mirror while with two women, now that doesn't seem too bad but right after when they're sleeping the women are ready to leave but Bateman makes them stay saying ""We're not finished yet"" as he takes out a coat hanger out of a drawer as he does we see that he has many different instruments. The films cut's to Bateman letting them out and we see the first girl with cuts on the back of her shoulder and a bloody nose and the other leaving angerly only saying later on that she had to go to the emergency room afterward.<br/><br/>The whole film is chock full of weird disturbing imagery but that shouldn't drive you away because Christian Bale delivers a stellar performance and you really feel and believe that he's a psychopath. A little heads up for those who aren't the best with gore be wary that there is a very plentiful amount of blood and gore hence the R rating but I hope whoever watches this really enjoys it, it's definitely one that you won't forget."
"ironcraftleague","9","1","1","9 January 2019"," A great character study.
","I love the character of Patrick Bateman and how the movie goes deeper and deeper into his mind. When he goes insane you feel the dread, suspense, and murderous intention out of someone you thought was trustful. Aside from that, a lot of things are done well. Such as his murder spree which was a great touch of action and overall carnage that felt controlled yet totally savage (you can kinda sum up the feel of the film by saying that). However, things weren't explain that I still didn't get which made me a little disappointed. Why was this big confession nothing? How did the cops not find him? It's kinda open ended, which could be smart, but it feels a little lazy. I'd if they explained those small details, but I could understand due to run time. Still a little upsetting though. 9/10."

"Ivny","10","1","1","13 December 2018"," Good movie
","I found the movie very good! None of the reasons that address all the ""coincidences"" of the nuances of a psychopathic structure in an ultra capitalist society. A comment on the difference between visual and visual to ""feel bad"" inside, which is ""empty"" of emotions. The protagonist (psychopath) lived trying to fit in, trying to be the ""ideal"", but was diminished because he worked in his father's company. He never came to admire others or the recognition of colleagues. Even wearing branded clothes, good beauty routines, a ""perfect"" girlfriend, etc. He had a mania of cleanliness, of organization, of body worship, and, in addition to being very narcissistic, it was empty and cold. Everything was based on creating a perfect exterior, clothes, apartments, business cards, best restaurants ... even the sex movies were scripted, to make them perfect! the first to have been subjected to total control, subjugating and threatening the person's life? He liked music because he was extremely intelligent and rationally cold. It has no feelings, but how music can have meaning in many ways. He did kill all people! However, the film's biggest criticism is precisely the fact that no one has noticed it. There was no one there, someone was really importing nothing but status. The dictator was having dinner with the victim as he confused the names (as the investigator had already been commented on with the protagonist at a dinner party). The person in charge of the building, thinking about the sale of the property, covered the bodies found. And in the end, the protagonist had a crisis of nervous laughter, because it was not a society that did not see, did not see anyone! Finally, the lack of ""feel"" and the one who carries it, makes the psychopaths often kill. Trying to feel something, inflicting its victims. We are surrounded by psychopaths who do not kill, but inflict a lot of pain on people. In a narcissistic and capitalistic society, where it is more important than being, this can be very exacerbated and incredibly dangerous."

"apryla-58795","10","1","1","26 August 2018"," ""I'm in Murders & Executions""
","Wow! Just wow! I have seen this movie 3 times since it's release. The first time I saw it I was largely shocked, disturbed, disgusted and wishing I could unsee it. BUT I also was blown away by Christian Bale's performance. Now...I have seen the videos and I've heard the rumors about him being difficult to work with etc...but you have to give credit where it's due - he was absolutely brilliant & amazing in this role. If you have not seen this film you truly have to experience it. I don't condone the goriness or the pornographic material or the extreme violence but viewing it is almost like a study of two things. First of all if for nothing else it's a master acting class. Secondly it's to see an actor perform the role of a lifetime in general but also to see the best performance I believe of Christian Bale's career. I haven't seen all of his films but I've seen most of them and I have to say that even though he is a great actor I don't think any of his other roles come close to this one. I would even go so far as to say that I think it's probably one of the best if not the best performance I've ever seen from any actor ever in all the films I've seen and I've seen a lot. Here is why I think that. He took what I think is possibly one of the most difficult characters to portray and he 1000% nailed it. I think Patrick Bateman would be one of the most difficult characters to portray due to that fact that not only did CB have to commit to this role physically (which is no small thing) he had to find some way to completely get inside the mind of a psychopath and portray that. This role was an extreme challenge because the Patrick Bateman character was acting himself so as to not give away that he was a psychopath. He knew that to be accepted in society he had to act. He was not being his true self so everything about him was an outward act. So not only did Christian Bale have to act like Patrick Bateman - he had to act like an idea of what Patrick Bateman thought he should act like! That is some serious material to master.<br/><br/>The murder scenes are really where you see the truly brilliant talent. It's so terrifyingly unsettling because he kills his victims so violently yet the scene is juxtaposed with extremely over the top humor all while listening to popular upbeat music while it's happening. That is so much for the mind to take in. It's almost like your mind is overloaded and you can't deal with it. But as weird as it sounds it's beautiful to behold.<br/><br/>I didn't think I'd ever watch it again but I did so several years later out of curiousity just to see if my reactions to it had changed...Nope! Still the same. And then several years after that viewing I watched it for a 3rd time the other night when my husband decided to watch it again because he hadn't seen it in years either and was curious to see what he thought after all that time had gone by. My reaction-about the same but yet with an even deeper appreciation of Christian Bale's performance.<br/><br/>I had forgotten about all the other actors who were in it. They did well in their roles as well.<br/><br/>This is one of the films that the more you watch it the more you pick up or notice. The one liners are great ""I've got to return some videotapes!"" ""Have a holly jolly Christmas."" So funny! Plus there's other things that you pick up that you didn't notice in previous viewings such as - this time around I noticed that when Christian Bale's character goes to chase that hooker down the hallway he's completely naked yet he found time to put on tennis shoes before he started chasing her. I never noticed that before. Just imagining him putting on his tennis shoes before he goes to kill her it's just ridiculous! It is so funny to me and I completely missed that the last two times I watched it. It's just one more small detail that shows you inside the character's mind.<br/><br/>I'm not one who gets into violence or the exploitation of women and oddly enough I can't even say I liked the film. But I can appreciate a great performance and while I could have done without a lot of those scenes they aren't just gratuitous. They really were necessary to portray this character.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film."

The ending left me confused and I just wanted to know if it actually happened or it was just a dream. Even though the director said that she was aiming to make it seem very ambiguous, I reckon that it was going more towards the idea of it all being in his head, although I was looking for reassurance. So the director's choices at the end a bit disappointed me.

","American Psycho is the story of a psychotic investment banker - Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). He has a nice apartment, a beautiful fiancée and a nice job. However he also has a darker side. When he isn't out partying with his friends, he is out murdering prostitutes, homeless and anyone else who annoys him.<br/><br/>While the movie certainly diverts from the book (written by Bret Easton Ellis). I'd say it diverts for the better. The book may be darker and use a lot more disturbing imagery to get its satire across, the movie instead uses a lighter tone. It still manages to deliver that biting satire about yuppie culture in the eighties.<br/><br/>This is a movie that shines on re-watchings. The subtle details that the actors and actresses display is phenomenal along with the small things that pull it all together. The movie displays fragile masculinity in its purest form with vain and cruel men in focus. It shows how cruel this yuppie world can be, and at times you almost sympathise with Bateman on his quest to be noticed and stand out. The movies use of the song ""Hip to be Square"" is quite apt.<br/><br/>The ending may feel a bit lackluster to some but the unsatisfyingness (best word to describe it) fits with the narrative.<br/><br/>It may not be perfect. But considering that I've written a full length essay on this movies subject, and it still holds up - I'd say it's a great satire."
"adam_pittavino","10","1","1","13 June 2018"," Dont you want to know what i do?
","Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel of the same title gave readers the perfect insight to America's corporate obsession with materialism as greed and escess seemed to replace what was wholesome and warm about the decade before it. The 1980's is the right environment for an emotionally bankrupt, ego driven maniac to pursue his blood thirsty tendencies as Christian Bale dishes up Patrick Bateman, one of cinemas most talked about characters in recent memory. Patrick works on wall street. He's a sneering, condesending, selfish and shallow psychotic that commits blatant, random acts of violence, his pseudo-preppie diction noticeable but not unfamilier when in social circles. One memorable scene has Bateman comparing buisness cards with his colleague's, a fierce undertone of jealousy washes over him as he realises their offerings maybe be more impressive than his own. On the surface, his personality fits in with the crowd he surrounds himself with, but his disregard for peoples feelings, let alone their lives is what ultimetely drives his lust for killing. American Psycho isnt overly gory, it isnt overly violent, but its ambitious and confident and these traits are what made it one of the best films of the year. American Psycho is many things, part black comedy, part horror but above all its a satire on a generation that knows no limits."

","American Psycho (2000) really is all about Christian Bale's descent into complete madness. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a very handsome 27 year old business man who has an extremely dark, sadistic side to him that nobody knows about. The plot revolves around Bateman and this dark side of himself, and what the horrible consequences are. One thing is for damn sure, this is not a flowery happy film, it's a dark film that isn't for everyone. It's a crime film but it also has some satire to it as well. There are other well known actors involved too. Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, and Josh Lucas. Lucas and Theroux play Batemans jackass colleagues. They aren't deep characters, they're just kind of the stereotypical chauvinistic privileged jerks. The other characters in the movie aren't really focused on though, this is Bale's movie, it's all about him. I will say that Bale's performance is very good, it's skillful and I don't think anyone could have played it like he did. I think this is a good film, not an excellent one. I didn't really care the satirical aspect of the movie, didn't appeal to me. The main thing I enjoyed was Bale's acting. I suggest it if it's your kind of movie, but it's not highly suggested.

"Red-Barracuda","10","1","1","16 January 2017"," Brilliant adaption of a very transgressive novel
","I remember when the novel American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis was first released. It caused huge amounts of controversy on account of its scenes of extreme violence which were considered to be very misogynistic. So much so, that someone even worked out that an anagram of the author's name was 'to sell be nastier'! I ended up reading the book myself and it is true that the acts of violence get progressively more and more extreme and grim, they are disturbing for sure. But it was also equally true that this was a highly satirical work of the blackest comedy.<br/><br/>The film version came along after quite a long genesis and naturally it got people wondering how such a book could possibly be made without being banned in almost every territory on Earth. As it turned out, the film version was a very clever interpretation of the novel which wisely understood that it could not possibly depict the violent excesses of the novel in their undiluted form but instead deftly finds ways to get around this. The ultimate result in my view is one of the few examples where the movie matches up to the novel.<br/><br/>Set in the late 80's Manhattan the film centres on Patrick Bateman, who by day is a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who is obsessed with success, fashion and expensive restaurants, and who by night is a serial killer. By focusing on this character the story is perfectly positioned to become a satire of 80's America and the greed and selfishness that is synonymous with certain subcultures of that era. Bale himself is emotionally sterile, he has lots of money, an expensive apartment and a beautiful fiancé but he is utterly shallow and devoid of taste. Some of the funniest scenes focus on these aspects of his character such as when he hilariously offers up his opinions on his favourite music, giving detailed, yet inane, analysis on the very mainstream 80's acts Phil Collins, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News. In another brilliant, telling scene Bateman and several of his peers compare business cards; as Bateman eyes each, practically identical, card you can sense his discomfort that his card might not be 'the best'. This scene is presented like it's a highly suspenseful revelation from a thriller and is played completely straight. That's what makes it so funny because it is negligible subjects such as the font of a business card that truly are the things of paramount importance in the world of Bateman and his cronies.<br/><br/>It has to be said here that Christian Bale in the title role is nothing short of a revelation. It's one of my all-time favourite performances from any actor and it really showcases what a brilliant talent he is; he completely nails this character in a way that honestly feels like it could not have been improved by anyone else. Much credit also must go to director Mary Harron who has taken on a pretty challenging project in trying to adapt such a novel. There is no question in my mind that she has succeeded better than could ever have been expected. The film has to tone things down for sure but it still contains some pretty disturbing scenes nevertheless; but the focus is more squarely on the satirical elements of the story and those are explored very well indeed. In the final analysis, I would recommend both reading the book and watching the movie, as both are very high calibre examples of their type."

The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and blood lust lead him to serial killing.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman, the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style.

Donald Kimble, a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen, whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. <br/><br/>This satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classicism with homicide, but you may laugh at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.But nevertheless,Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.Also,it captures the 80's era when the events of this film happened.Overall,it is an underrated masterpiece."

","This was a wicked movie. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Christian Bale played a very convincing psycho. I loved his evil stares and the way his mouth was always formed into a straight line. I watched the TV version on TBS so I didn't see that much violence and gore but I saw enough to know what was going on. I didn't quite fully understand what his motive was for killing but I could tell that just about everyone he killed was annoying and he really couldn't stand them. I thought he he did a good job of not letting everyone know about the murders and keeping them a secret. Patrick Bateman was very scary at times. Especially when he was chasing the girl with the chainsaw and he was covered in blood. I really don't have a whole lot to say about ""American Psycho"" except that I thought it was a great horror movie and that the ending could've been better. But Christian Bale was very good in this one and his role was convincing. I recommend this one to anyone who likes this genre of movies. But I'm gonna go now and thanks for reading my review! Bye!"

","I loved this film. It wasn't a comedy but it was comedic in scenes due to the cluelessness and lethargy of the other characters. Patrick Bateman is a serial killer, plain and simple, but that is not the purpose of this film. The main character thinks that he can get away with anything because he is rich and priveleged. The movie was violent, but not as much of the book. However, I think blood and gore would have taken away from the overall satire of the film by turning it into a campy horror movie. The film had a not-so-clear subtext: The absurdity of the killer's actions and motives equal that of the rich, corporate, snob's. Does a world based on business cards, fancy restaurants, and affairs have any more depth than that of a self-obsessed, unremourseful, unhuman creature such as Patrick Bateman? That is what you'll be asking yourself at the end of this movie. I give it a 9/10!"

","Warning, may contain some small spoilers:<br/><br/>If anyone remembers the 80's the way I do, it goes something like this.....<br/><br/>If you can graduate from a prestigious university in Canada or the U.S. you immediately will have a plethora of job offers thrown at you in which many of them will pay you large sums of money.  There could be some in the new computer field, it could be a brokerage firm or it could be just plain and simply, big business.<br/><br/>It was cool, not just cool but imperative to wear the lateset fashions by Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein.  The fitness craze was launched by Olivia Newton John, Arnold Schwartzenegger and Stallone.  Words like diaretics and emphetimines were launched into our vernacular.  We blasted our pecs, did our backs and spent countless hours doing sit-ups.  BMer's and Jags and 'Vettes were the sought after cars and a man was judged by his wallet. Greed was good according to Gordon Gekko.  Life was great.  But it couldn't last and it didn't.  And now here we are recovering from ( economically speaking ) the disasterous 90's.  And we are reminded of it all again in this smart sadistic but brilliant satire of greed and lust in the 80's. Maybe the book was about a guy that just simply killed because he was psychotic, but the film is cynical look at what we all strived to be in the 80's and perhaps what we all still want to be in the new millenium.  I have never seen a film like American Psycho before and I really don't anticipate on seeing one like it again.  If you don't like this film it is maybe because you don't understand it.  Maybe that isn't fair since I hated Magnolia and those that praise it say the same thing to me, but I do feel that way in this case.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is a 27 year old yuppie that has it all at some synthetic job in some synthetic building on Wall Street.  He takes pride in everything that he does.  Everything from his outer appearance to the look of his business cards.  Everything is a trophy to him and to the cronies that inhabit his world.  In one of the best scenes done in any film that I can remember, when Bateman is dragging a dead body to his car, with a train line of blood stains left behind by the body, one of his friends that he sees him on the streets says in ghastly shock as he is loading the body bag into the car, "" Oh my gosh!  Where did you get that designer bag? ""  That note, but not that note alone, but that note can be a microcosm for what the film is all about.  People see what they want to see and this time in our history was perhaps the worst for it.  The characters in this movie, while important in their own worlds, are merely just another face in the crowd that no one seems to really care about.  Paul Allen may as well be a bum in an alley, that is how much fuss is created when he disappears.  This is a world that can drive people mad just because someone elses business card has the perception of being nicer than the other guys.  It is synthetic, un-noteworthy things that drive men nuts in this film, and especially the main character in this film.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is Patrick Bateman.  At first I couldn't understand why the actor chose to play the character the way he was, but fifteen minutes later you do understand.  This performance is one that should not be forgotten. He looks great on the outside but to paraphrase a line that he uses in the film "" I have all the traits of a normal human being, but there simply is nothing going on upstairs. ""<br/><br/>"" Today I just had to kill a lot of people! ""<br/><br/>American Psycho is a sick, twisted, hilarious and brilliant film.  It is original and it will make you think long after you have left the theater. And as a bonus too, there is no clear conclusion to the film.  You can interpret it two ways.  Both ways make sense to me and maybe they are both right.  I really don't care what the book was trying to do or say, this film has it's own way of saying it.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  If anything, it will challenge your thinking, and that is always a positive thing in a film.  But other than that, it is a damn fine film and one of the best films so far in this young millenium!<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a guy who may seem normal, but is really not. I really like drama/thrillers, usually ones like this too, but this movie is awful and has so many flaws. Christian Bale does give a good performance here though as he manages to pull of the good guy vibe and the bad guy vibe all in one well, but that's not enough to save this movie.

","Well, watch out for spoilers!<br/><br/>Yeah, pretty funny, but got a bit wierd towards the end, when it turns out that he wasn't a killer after all, just deranged. Which for me, spoiled the film a bit, meaning some of the best (or shocking scenes, depending on your view point) never happened. What a shame. The best scene by far was the axe murder. I think, even if I was drunk, if I saw newspaper on the ground and my host putting on a mac, I might get a bit worried. Nah, Idiot, deserved to die :) I haven't read the book, and am unlikely to, so I couldn't say how it is all meant to fit in, but as a viewer I felt the ending belittled what had gone before.<br/><br/>Oh, the telephone confession was a touch of class too :)"
"MitHundeSein","6","1","1","21 May 2001"," American Psycho must be approached strictly as satire.
","Spoilers.<br/><br/>First, any film that requires the viewer to read the novel it was based on is automatically a failure. Fortunately, that is not true of American Psycho. While reading the novel may help, the film successfully stands on its own. I haven't read the novel yet, and my comments will refer to the film alone.<br/><br/>Second, the film should be regarded strictly as a satire and all the events and plot twists are in service to that purpose. If the viewer encounters elements that do not seem believable on a realistic level, then that viewer should look for an allegorical meaning instead. The advertising for American Psycho, in its attempt to draw in a wider audience, did it an injustice by making it seem to be a thriller or psychological portrait of a serial killer. The film is neither of these genres. The film is about the violent and soulless greed of the eighties, the carnage that this greed caused, and the utter failure of justice to correct or even learn from the catastrophe that followed. When we keep these themes in mind, the characters and events of the film are far more understandable.<br/><br/>On the larger scale, the film comments upon the destruction wrought by the eighties greed, which is best exemplified by the Savings and Loan collapse. These financial failures are like the mangled bodies of psychotic killers, raped and killed with impunity. The justice system seemed utterly impotent in the face of such well-mannered and slick criminals. These corporate killers showed brazen lack of concern about getting caught; nonetheless they escaped justice. Their charmed life always magically provided someone to clean up their messes. Detective Kimball's failure to figure out the truth reflects the law's inability to impose justice upon this situation.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is both an exemplar of the shallowness and obsession for surfaces of the era and a failure by its standards. Despite obsessively conforming to the mores of his social circle (""I just want to fit in""), he nonetheless fails to succeed in the continuous competition with his peers, so amusingly depicted in the scene of business card envy. His inward emptiness is displayed by the lavish praise and attention he gives to the blandest of pop music--Phil Collins is the most sublime experience Bateman is capable of. As a consequence of his ability to gain the respect of his colleagues, he also fails to distinguish himself as an individual apart from the multitude of empty suits that comprise his social circle. This lack of determinate personality explains the constant mistaking of his identity by his peers and their refusal to believe that the `lightweight' Bateman is capable of committing deeds not only terrible but decisive.<br/><br/>The paradox of Bateman's intense desire to succeed lies in the attempt to create an authentic personality by conforming to social standards that make it impossible to distinguish oneself except by winning the endless competition over externals: the most stylish apartment, the bigger account, the best business card. Bateman fails in each of these competitions and each failure leads to a violent episode of sex and murder. He too shows complete disregard for the consequences and fails to take even the most basic precautions against discovery; he leaves trails of blood in the lobby of his building, occupies the apartment of the victim for whose disappearance he is being investigated, runs naked through the halls of an apartment house chasing a screaming prostitute while brandishing a chainsaw, and so on. As the film near its conclusion, it seems that Bateman can't possibly escape, but like his brothers in the financial massacre, everything, even his repeated confession, is magically overlooked, ignored, and disbelieved.<br/><br/>In the final scene, Bateman and his colleagues sit in a yuppie bar looking up at the television screen, admiring Ronald Reagan for his inner ruthlessness. This scene recalls the conclusion of 1984, in which a defeated Winston Smith sits sipping Victory gin in the Victory café, crying tears of love for the image of Big Brother on the monitor and confessing to crimes he did not commit. Smith's inner self has been exterminated and all that remains is a shell able to think only what it has been conditioned to think. In the same vein, Bateman's desperate attempt to become a person has also been crushed, but not by the same means. The charmed life that saves him from the law is also his curse. Bateman comes to the realization that we cannot gain wisdom and self-knowledge from our crimes unless they are recognized as crimes and are punished accordingly. He remains the empty suit."

We don't know why this guy is so nuts, and we aren't made to care.<br/><br/>It's not a slasher, the violence is too subtle.  (Well shot, I must admit, but that's the only thing going for it.)  The scariest thing in here is the greasy hair on the actors.  It's not a suspense movie, for there is no suspense.  Others have called it a black comedy, but it's just not funny. Satire?  I don't think so.<br/><br/>Other's have recommended that we read the book to understand it.  Utter nonsense.  Movies are made as free-standing adaptations of books, not as supplements.  If I have to go find a book to understand Bateman, then the movie is a failure.  Somebody can't manage to tell a story.<br/><br/>The movie just follows around a ""serial killer"" as he goes about his daily life.  We are made to admire his physic, his clothes, his stinking business card...And the business card bit didn't even impress me and I typeset the things for a living!<br/><br/>I don't wish to spoil things for anyone who is so out of their mind that they are going to go watch this...

","I haven't read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis (no relation, thankfully), but now that I've watched the movie I feel the book  might help.  There's no possible way to figure out what director Mary Harron has put on the screen, and perhaps not even Mr. Ellis himself could explain it.  Or Harron either, for that matter.  Christian Bale plays a young, successful Wall Street executive whose cup of hate wildly runneth over, and he kills indiscriminately.  Or does he?  Are we only glimpsing his bloody and hideous fantasies?  I tend to think the latter is the case, because he leaves a vast trail of bodies behind him and yet he continues to pursue his usual lifestyle and nobody suspects him of anything.  Well, detective Willem Dafoe (completely wasted) thinks he may have been involved in the first real/false murder, but he disappears from the story early on.  No one else pays any attention to the endless mayhem.  Don't think for an instant that Harron has set up a Jekyll-and-Hyde character.  Bale is 95% Mr. Hyde and yet none of his friends ever seems to wonder what's wrong with this weirdo.  Unless, of course, he's imagining his own demeanor too.  This is a continuing problem with the plot and with Harron's direction: has she any purpose other than to confuse?  Is that a worthy goal for a director?  The story reaches a peak of mindless misdirection in the case of a hooker who ""needed surgery"" after her first ugly encounter with the Bale character.  They meet again.  Does she run away screaming?  Not in this movie.  Once more he entices her with money and soon he gives her a check.  A check?  I burst out laughing.  On another occasion, in his apartment, he sneaks up behind an unsuspecting female guest and has the muzzle of a monster gun within an inch of her skull.  He's psyched himself up to kill -- but suddenly his phone rings.  Several times. He freezes there, patiently waiting to hear the incoming message.  Yes, I think we're definitely dealing with a disordered mind.  Harron obviously loves gore -- real or imaginary -- and wallows in it throughout.  Bale is a fine actor and deserves far better.  If the movie poses the question, ""Are these real or imaginary murders?"" -- I don't have an answer.  If they ARE real, the movie is inept beyond belief.  But after spending two chaotic hours with this repellent thing, I think the American psycho should have considered adding director and writer to his hit list.  Real or imaginary. 3 stars out of 10"

However, the acting was good, and I thought the way all the cliched stuff of the '80's was brought was brilliant. AS were Batemens comments - particularly those in nightclubs... As for the horror and depravity of it all - for me, the movie just seemed to aimlessly plod along like a needle stuck in the groove of a record with the same thing being rehashed again and again, and when the needle finally skipped out, it was only to sink back into another endless repetitive groove...

","American Psycho is not a movie that most people will even begin to understand on the first try.  It goes beyond a satire of a limited range of 1980's yuppy culture, it is an evaluation of American society as a whole. Pay careful attention to the movie's ending and ask what it means.  The meaning is definitely there, but I won't explain it for you, even though it's subtle, I would rather people understood it on their own.  A casual movie goer looking for an exciting thriller will be horribly disappointed, especially by the ending.

","Having heard all of the hype about the twisted violence and sick imagery of the book, I was very curious as to how I would react to this movie. Movie violence usually doesn't bother me, but on occasion, I have been incredibly disturbed (example - ""I Spit On Your Grave"" which I could not sit through again). Here, though, I was very surprised to see very little violence, suspense or blood. This so-called ""sick"" movie was not sick at all. Despite not being scared, I thought that the movie did a wonderful job at satirizing the business world in the late 1980's (and it featured a great sound track of 80's music!). When I walked out, I was feeling a bit disappointed - not just by the under usage of the immensely talented Reese Witherspoon and Chloe Sevigny - but by the story itself. I wanted to know more. But the more I thought about it on the way home, the more I liked the way the movie handled the story. It really made me think, and it featured some very interesting twists. In addition, Christian Bale was absolutely mesmerizing in the title role. So although it was nothing like I expected, I thought that the movie was very well-done in other respects. 7/10"

This film abandons the idea of establishing characters for the sake of portraying a collective lifestyle that can best be described as shallow ""yuppiedom"". No backstory of the characters is provided and we are left to deduce for ourselves the killer's motivation for perpetrating his crimes, i.e., living a spiritually empty and unsatisfying existence? Without being given a legitimate motive behind these murders and without the presence of any sort of fleshed out characters, the audience is left with a cast of totally one dimensional characters who are being killed off left and right by a murderer who has no greater motive than having too much free time on his hands."

","I was compelled to rent this film by the other comments I read here, generally describing it as a brilliant satire. A very dark satire indeed. This, by the way, is literally verbalized in the main character's last lines something in the regard of: I am unable to sympathize, I only want to inflict pain on others; Expressing my pain does not make me feel any better, hence I see no hope for our world. We are witness to the development in the character - an entirely soulless entity, a killing machine, the very extremes of his behaviour leading him to some type of catharsis. The catharsis, however, does not bring relief - he is bound to agonize forever, finding himself in a completely dehumanized environment. A glimpse of hope is still possible to catch through the only openly humane character of Jean, to whom our hero attempts to reach out in his utter agony (ironically, Jean is the only one he held back from killing). ""American Psycho"" is a brave, blunt, desperate social satire; the last warning signal there could be. It is so shocking, it is easy for the viewer with dull senses to see it as ""pointless""."
"emmaamylouiserobins","10","3","6","13 January 2014"," No Introduction Necessary
","This is a movie I have seen at least ten times now, and every time I watch it I gain deeper insight into the mind of the protagonist, the director and of course, Bret Easton Ellis who wrote the novel on which the film is based.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gives an epic performance as the twisted Patrick Bateman, who is sickened by the world around him and everyone in it, and who wrestles with himself as he sicks to end his internal pain by inflicting it on others. Whilst obsessed with success and optimising himself, he pushes himself into the 80s yuppie lifestyle and then rails against it, and seeks to destroy anyone who believes in it. He is terrifying yet compelling to watch as his character descends deeper into psychotic frenzy as the film progresses, and he loses sight of what is reality and what is not. I cannot fault his acting - it is crisp, clean and his erratic emotions come across beautifully to the audience.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, in particular Reese Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe and Chloe Sevigny, were perfectly cast and gave believable performances in their three very different but complementary roles. The superficiality of Witherspoon's character, who does not realise how empty her relationship with Bateman is, presents a stark contrast to the depth seen in Bateman himself. Sevigny's character, the gentle Jean, is Bateman's one weakness. He sees in her his only hope for the future. She is the only one in the movie who shows genuine selflessness or a hope for a brighter future. Her innocence and purity is portrayed very successfully by Sevigny, with soft voice and wide eyes. Dafoe's character is one the audience finds difficult to predict, and this is down to the way that his character was played. It was shot three times where Dafoe played the role three different ways, which when edited were intertwined so there is no clear picture as to who he is and what he thinks. His excellent performance can then partially be attributed to Harron, the director.<br/><br/>The direction of this movie is exceptional. It is fast-paced and layered with additional meaning. No word goes amiss as the audience is plunged into the yuppie lifestyle and the harrowing events unfold around them. The dark comedy comes through with great subtlety, it is a satire unlike any other. You would not expect such nuance and slickness from what many class as a confusing gore, slasher or horror flick. Anyone who claims it as these things has severely missed the point.<br/><br/>The music in this film is completely the opposite of what you would expect. Many tracks are 80s pop songs, and this is one of the crucial threads through the movie. Bateman's extensive knowledge of 80s pop shows how he is a part of the culture that he so despises. The other music is considerably different, harsh violins which increase the suspense and darken the mood. <br/><br/>The lighting progressively dims through the movie, mirroring Bateman's descent, until the closing scene where it is once again bright as it was when the movie opened. This is a neat, but horrifying ending, as it shows the cyclical structure of the plot. <br/><br/>The confusion in this movie is part of its brilliance. Many of the actors look similar, wear similar clothes and accessories, work in the same company and do the same job. The characters also frequently mistake one another for somebody else. Many characters appear once and then disappear for the rest of the movie. Names are interchangeable, people get mixed up, and nobody cares apart from Bateman and this is only at the end when his mind is unravelling and he craves his punishment. Then there is the ultimate question of how much of this movie is reality and how much is fantasy. As the voice-over is Bateman, it is all from his perspective, and his psychosis is so erratic and unpredictable that the audience is left as perplexed as he is. There is a perfect moment near the end of the movie where the audience sees Bateman himself realise that what he is experiencing cannot be entirely real, leading everyone, including Bateman, to question what we have seen before and what we will see after. <br/><br/>The first time I saw the movie, I would have only given it a seven out of ten, for the superlative acting, costume, lighting and camera work. I found the plot and dialogue difficult, and when I watched the movie a second time, I saw that this was the idea. I appreciated the intense, multi-layered craftsmanship which makes this film now one of my absolute favourites. It is Harron's indisputable masterpiece in my opinion, and well worth the watch. Twice."
"Manal1987","8","3","6","26 May 2011"," American Psycho... American Society.
","American Psycho is a movie that digs psychologically in order to hit socially. The story is certainly brilliant and mind-spinning, thanks to Bret Easton's book. <br/><br/>American Psycho is about an apathetic successful rich young man, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who suffers from grave psychological disturbances that make him go into killing frenzies. One of the first lines that Bateman says in the movie goes as follows: ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there."" These words apparently set the stage for the events to follow in the film. This idea of being an abstraction resurfaces at the end, making things clearer. American Psycho does not criticize Bateman as an individual. Being and abstraction, he stands for all the 1980s yuppies; this class of young gentlemen who nearly had everything: fame, money and success, yet were vain, stupid, materialistic and superficial from the inside, and who also lost touch with their society and humanity. Sharing the same characteristics is beautifully represented in the movie more than once as everybody gets mistaken for somebody else. Thus, since the idiosyncrasies disappear, the whole society manifests itself in one facade-like individual: Patrick Bateman. <br/><br/>Bateman is extremely self-conscious; he is obsessed with cleanness, health, looks and fancy clothes, which almost applies to everyone else. Bateman starts having this killing fits in which he murders prostitutes, strangers and even his colleagues in cold blood. However, unlike the common analysis, I tend to believe that these murders are real, but since Bateman is not an individual as I mentioned before, they are committed by the whole society. How he gets away with all his murders and insults people without them responding show that he is a recurrent case... a collective human condition with no material existence. <br/><br/>Christian Bale has certainly excelled himself with this hauntingly beautiful performance. To be able to capture the anxiety, rage, vanity and insanity of an entire society and represent them in one character is sheer brilliance and exquisite talent."

","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, good-looking Wall Street businessman with his own office, a pretty PA (Chloë Sevigny), an attractive fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), a desirable Manhattan apartment, and a fine collection of sharp implements and power tools, perfect for hacking up hookers and ridding himself of pesky professional competition.<br/><br/>American Psycho, based on the controversial cult novel by Bret Easton Ellis, is a razor-sharp satire of the yuppie lifestyle that will forever be associated with the late '80s, an era when success was often measured by how much money you earned, who you knew, what suit you wore, and which restaurants you could get reservations at.<br/><br/>Bale's narcissistic Bateman epitomises the yuppie stereotype—self-obsessed, materialistic, power hungry, and predatory, his life is dedicated to feeling superior to all those around him, no doubt because that, secretly, he knows that he is devoid of genuine worth: his position in the company is shared by several indentikit employees (so alike that there are frequent cases of mistaken identity); his fiancé is having an affair (but then so is he); and the only person who truly likes him (apart from himself) is his secretary, who he stupidly deems unworthy of his magnificence. Deep down, he's a very insecure and confused individual.<br/><br/>To compensate for his shallow existence, Bateman extends his lack of empathy and ruthlessness much further than most: he not only humiliates and dominates all around him, both at work and at play, but he also kills!<br/><br/>Both the book and film have been accused of being overly violent and misogynistic, and it is true that many scenes are extremely disturbing and very gory, with extreme brutality frequently dished out casually by an emotionally disconnected Bateman; but not only is American Psycho a very unsettling affair, it is also a very funny one (particularly for those with an extremely dark sense of humour), with hilarious satirical displays of oneupmanship between the high-rolling yuppies, amusing deadpan critiques of popular music as Bateman casually prepares for more bloody mayhem, and towards the end, several scenes of sheer unbridled lunacy (try keeping a straight face as Bateman attempts to feed a cat to an ATM).<br/><br/>In the film's closing chaotic moments, events become very confusing, with a crazed Bateman finally revealing all to his lawyer over the phone; the very next day, however, we learn that the lawyer has not only taken Bateman's confession to be a sick joke, but also seems to believe him to be someone else entirely. At face value, this all seems terribly unlikely, but it does adhere nicely to the reoccurring theme of lack of individuality; it is also a deliberate ploy by director Mary Harron to allow her audience to come to their own conclusions about Bateman's predicament. Is he free to carry on killing or has all that we have witnessed only occurred in Bateman's unhinged mind? Hell, by the closing credits, we aren't even sure if Bateman is actually who he thinks he is.<br/><br/>Usually, I don't like ambiguous endings that much, but in such a demented, twisted, schizophrenic movie, it seems like the only satisfactory way to finish."
"LoveBeingScared","10","3","6","9 July 2007"," A definite 10
","I simply have to give this movie a 10, I absolutely adore this movie. Christian Bale portrayed his character Patrick Bateman with such elegance, accuracy, and conviction. I was in love with him within 30 minutes. The dark comedy the film gives is absolutely brilliant. There is no other serial killer/slasher movie that can even compare to American Psycho. Between Batemans OCD, lewd murders, and uncanny knowledge for 80's music, he is by far the best since Norman Bates. I recommend this film to everyone, even if you don't watch horror. I have seen this film at least 100 and I own it, so as you can tell it's just plain GREAT!!"

","I've never read the book, but I know a lot of people who did, and they tend to not like the movie. Now, I always think movies based on books should be judged as separate entities. It's adapted by a screenwriter and interpreted by a director, and they may make choices that the author didn't intend. This doesn't instantly make one or the other better or worse, they're just different. That being said, it seemed like the reason a lot of the fans of the book were disappointed was because Mary Harron wasn't interested in depicting scenes of extreme gore. This isn't a Fulci film and it isn't Hostel, it's brilliant social commentary and comedy. Of course this is the most pitch black sort of humour, but it cracks me up. Most of the humour comes from this central point: Patrick Bateman is a psychopath, a completely soulless person incapable of thinking of anyone but himself, and in the booming 80s Wall Street world, he fit in perfectly. It's been noted that Bale's performance even caused some viewers to like Bateman. But how couldn't they. Look at all of his ""friends"" and ""lovers."" They're able to feel empathy, they choose to live this way. They're the monsters. Bateman can't help but be like them. So when Bateman raises an axe to Paul Allen (played by the equally despicable Jared Leto) you can't help but share in his glee. The yucks don't stop. The business card one-upping (uh, I think they're all the same), Bateman's call for a return to morals at some ridiculous restaurant, the girl who confuses ""mergers and acquisitions"" for ""murders and executions."" In particular Bateman's lengthy monologues about his awful taste in music (early Huey Lewis was too ""black sounding,"" Genesis really came into their own once Phil Collins took the reigns.) These tend to precede his violent acts, and I think they're the crux of the film. While he has a lot of knowledge and has clearly put a lot of thought into his opinions, the music he loves and his appreciation for it is just like him, soulless. A perfect surface wrapped around a gaping void. Anyways, I could go on, but I have to return some videotapes."
"gavin6942","9","3","6","16 April 2007"," Dark Commentary on 80s Wall Street Culture
","Patrick Bateman is a heartless man with no concern for those around him. Serial killer... or capitalist? This film explains there might not be much difference and perhaps shows us why serial killers in the 1980s were more celebrated than any time before or since in popular culture.<br/><br/>This is not a film for everyone. Some (like myself) will love every little aspect, while others might be turned off my the sex and violence... or just be really confused by the style (the directing is weird, but actually pretty straight-forward once you've read the book). I suppose that is to be expected. Even those looking for a horror film might be let down, as that isn't the real focus here.<br/><br/>The cast of this film is amazing. Willem Defoe needs no introduction. Chloe Sevigny (one of my favorites), Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon (not my favorite but good for her role) and Gwen Turner. Even Samantha Mathis shows up. But, of course, stealing the show is Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Bale was the perfect choice to play Bateman and I'm glad director Mary Harron would settle for no one else (turning down Ed Norton, who gets compared to Bale but remains inferior). Bale is able to be any character he wants (comapre this to ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"" and especially ""The Machinist"" and see if there's any of the same characters here). As Bateman, he is perfectly self-absorbed and also maniacally distant. The little dance during the Huey Lewis scene (one I have heard he added himself) remains for me one of the two key scenes (the other involving a chainsaw).<br/><br/>Besides the great acting (the real reason to watch this), the music is very noteworthy. The book does a fine job of elaborating on the music of the 1980s, and I think they incorporated that well here (throwing it in to death scenes rather than as solo pieces adds an interesting twist). This film, along with the gentlemen I go to the tavern with, really got me into Huey Lewis and Phil Collins. Which is really wonderful. Not so much on the Robert Palmer or Whitney Houston...<br/><br/>I guess I should also compliment them on the tasteful way (read: artistic) the sex and violence was done. Ax wounds, chainsaws and bite marks... threesomes and science-knows-what done with a coat hangar. But the vast majority is shot from such angles that it's almost all left to the imagination: you think you see more than you really do.<br/><br/>Clearly, I really want you to see this film. It's possibly Bale's best, or at least the one that pushed him into the spotlight. He steals the show. You won't like it if you don't like horror, but the title is ""American Psycho"" and the cover has a man with a knife, so you know what you're getting yourself into. Grab some popcorn and a Cherry Coke Zero and kick your feet up. Enjoy!"
"mcfly-31","Null","3","6","10 March 2007"," Bale-out....
","Over 800 comments, so I usually don't bother, but I must speak...<br/><br/>This is one of the more ungodly stupid movies I've watched in a while. From Bale's first line-delivery where he seems to channel Jim Carrey, to all of the blathering murder sequences (with endlessly needless dissertations on 80s music), I was fidgeting pretty quick. Then it totally lost me minutes later when he inexplicably stabs a homeless man and stomps a small dog to death. And this after both encouraging the man and then telling him what a waste of life he is. An anti-hero if I've ever seen one. The entire tone of this film is insanely awkward, at times seeming to be a comedy dealing with a self-absorbed narcissist, who happens to sprinkle in blood-drenched murders here and there. No, I haven't read the book, and no, maybe I don't get the ""satirical"" approach others love. Either way, it was just jumbled garbage. Bale is a chameleon of sorts, sometimes resembling Cruise or Hart Bochner, but that unbearable, irritatingly pompous voice grated on me pretty quick. Only saving grace is some great 80s period atmosphere, right down to a keypad on an ATM machine with the BIG WHITE numbers. Other than that, cultists will be sure to keep this alive and well for years to come."

","Mary Harron's intelligent adaptation is much funnier than Brett Easton Ellis' controversial novel, and manages to capture the essential ambiance of the book without relying on gross-out schlock horror tactics.<br/><br/>The ultra-violence is completely toned down in favour of a more subtle approach, and the most effective scenes are frequently not the ones featuring Patrick Bateman's nocturnal chainsaw frenzies, but instead those concerned with the banal, superficial world of designer-obsessive, over competitive uber-execs working on Wall Street in the 1980s. In this respect it's something of a period piece, employing 80s trappings such as absurdly chunky mobile phones, decidedly suspect hairstyles and Hugo Boss power suits.The ability to secure a reservation at the latest exclusive restaurant is the benchmark by which these characters are judged. Essentially it's as much a satire on the materialistic ethos of the decade as it is a study of terminal psychological disintegration.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, in what might be a career-defining role, carries the whole movie - but that's not to detract from the extremely witty script which recreates some of the book's seminal scenes to great effect. It's a tribute to his strong central performance that despite Bateman's glaring character flaws (vanity, self-obsession, a penchant for slaying innocent people with nail guns) he actually succeeds in making him quite sympathetic. He even attempts to warn people about his psychopathic tendencies, but these random pleas for help go totally unheard by the hip disaffected Manhattenites he's forced to hang out with.<br/><br/>Trapped in a nightmarishly amoral world, and devoid of any recognisable human emotions other than anger and disgust, Bateman ultimately comes across as the biggest victim of them all. Even when he openly admits to his multiple crimes, his yuppie contemporaries refuse to accept the confession, because mass-murder just isn't the done thing. There's even the hint of a conspiracy of silence, a suggestion that somebody might be covertly covering up the evidence of his deranged activities.<br/><br/>There are also some great supporting roles, notably from Chloe Seveigny as his doting secretary and Willem Dafoe as the cop who is aware of Bateman's guilt but doesn't seem that concerned with stopping him. Like the book, the film has no satisfactory resolution, and the audience is left with the impression that Bateman is still out there, drilling holes in prostitutes heads, waiting in vain for someone to catch him. Considering the problematic pre-production period, this film has triumphantly emerged from development hell to give moviegoers a serious slice of the very blackest humour. And thankfully, no Leo Dicaprio to spoil the fun...."

","First and foremost anyone seeing this movie should keep in mind one thing: it is a comedy. A dark one but a hilarious one. I know it is a graphic movie but when you understand the humor and the fantasy of the movie you can truly appreciate it. It is a dark satire. Movies like this are not seen in our movie culture that much. This whole Hollywood special effects thing is played out. Aren't you guys sick of the same thing over and over again. This movie is smart and you can watch it 50 times and still miss the jokes. Anyone who actually reads this comment come away with one thing-- when watching the movie listen for how Patrick responds to Jean's compliment about him looking good in the morning. His response is hilarious, if you don't find it funny you should just give up on trying to enjoy life. That is all I have to say .. I know it is hard for everyone to realize but everything is in Bateman's head. Thanks for reading my short opinion. Feed me a stray cat. Its all hilarious."

","There are at least ten reasons why you should watch this wonderful, macabre movie:<br/><br/>10) Justin Theroux is in the movie and he went to Bennington. So did Bret Easton Ellis, who you undoubtedly know wrote the book this movie is based on, but they didn't attend at the same time. That's okay though because I just like that a Bennington alumnus starred in a film based on a book by another alumnus. That and I think Theroux can be talented when working with a decent director, as he does here. <br/><br/>9) They kill Jared Leto's character. Any movie that does that gets at least an additional two stars. It can make a mediocre movie into something I would describe as ""a good way to spend two hours"" (Panic Room, I'm looking at you). <br/><br/>8) The book is pretty much unreadable, to me, and not because of its gore (though there's some rough stuff there); it's just boring and the pages and pages and pages about Huey Lewis really aren't that fascinating to anyone other than BEE. <br/><br/>7) The obligatory defusing of misogyny: It was made by a woman! The Patrick Bateman character kills women (grusomely)! So it's okay! I'm not sure I buy that line of reasoning. Frankly, the violence against women here is appropriate because, duh, we're not supposed to like Patrick Bateman. We're supposed to see him as a product of his deluded times. We're supposed to understand that he's either become unhinged as a result of contemporary impersonality or he's a monster because of that impersonality. <br/><br/>6) Willem Defoe's performance as an inept version of Columbo (who was inept enough as it was) is brilliant. <br/><br/>5) The film is delirious, completely. It moves fast and, in a lot of ways, seems as insane as its anti-protagonist. However, it never feels that it's out of control; you know all the time that the filmmakers know how crazy, absurd, and darkly funny the material and performances are. It's almost like some gruesome, EC comic from the 1950s. That's a compliment. <br/><br/>4) Reese Witherspoon<br/><br/>3) Remember how I complained about pages upon pages in the book that expound upon the virtues of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis? Here they work because their shorter and, frankly, they're visual jokes, ultimately. Who knew it was funnier to actually watch a deranged psychopath go after someone with an ax while discussing Sussudio?<br/><br/>2) Christian Bale proves yet again that he needs more work. I'm glad he's getting more of it now, but I think those of us that saw this and Velvet Goldmine were wondering why we weren't seeing more of him. <br/><br/>1) It's just a very very good movie that many people will find enjoyable. Unless they dislike bloodshed, in which case they should stay away."
"jeremyrmanis","10","3","6","7 August 2005"," American Psycho.......more than a horror flick
","For those who have seen the advertised trailers, or have heard of this movie through unpleased viewers only, this movie is more than a horror flick. Even though the actual trailer for the movie is marketed as a common horror flick, don't be dissuaded. This movie is very telling about a genre in American history that has since evolved. The eighties in New York were a time that glamorized appearance without depth and ""style over substance."" This movie takes your mind through that period in time and shows viewers the horrible disorders of personality and shallowness of the soul that sought to ""kill"" those who would not fit in. Conformity, being a powerful motivator, drives you to do things that you normally would not. Patrick Bateman, the main character, played masterfully by Christian Bale, epitomizes the thesis stated above. His cold, dark appearance gives the full impact of what is one of the most controversial novels of the last 20 years. This is one of my favorite films because it is so telling about the human condition. Don't rent this movie.... Buy it."
"beatnick49","9","3","6","24 February 2003"," An ""undisputed masterpiece""
","Warning may contain spoilers<br/><br/>This movie is (as Bateman said about Hip To Be Square by Huey Lewis and the News) an ""undisputed masterpiece"". Like Fight Club, it succeeds with wit, dark satire, and a great social comment, against superficiality, conformity, and consumer culture. Mary Harron directs an excellent film, and she and Guinevere Turner convert the book into a marvelous screenplay.<br/><br/>This is a stunning and forthwright criticism on consumer culture, exposing it's mindlessness, ludicrousness, and rediculousness. The characters are immersed in a world of reservations, poular music, clothes fashion, affairs, and drugs. Countless restaurant and clothing brands are mentioned, with frequent appointments that must be met, Who has the best business card is a major obsession as are reservations.(Like they areb really that important) A good moment is when one of Bateman's friends who are among the people he competes with for the best business card, Van Patten, states that he is not really hungry but would like a reservation anyway. Chauvinism is also rampant, 20 years after the women's movement.<br/><br/>The cast is also well picked, Christian Bale is excellent as the crack snorting chauvinist Patrick Bateman whose life seems perfect on the surface with the apartment, limo, job, fiance, and friends, however his life is, in reality dull; repetitious and surrounded by people he envies and dislikes (such as the upstart Paul Allen, and the annoying Luis Carrurthers). In fact his lifestyle robs him of his humanity and his life is mundane; so much so it drives him crazy and derives him of all intellect (apart from brand names, restaurants, and pop-music)and emotion apart from (as Bateman himself tells us) ""greed and disghust"", his mind is so empty, killing is all he can ""do"" to fulfill himself.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast; Guinevere Turner is excellent as the model Elizabeth, Reese Witherspoon is excellent as the hopeful, and cheerful Evelyn Williams who is yet also a conformist like everyone else in the film, Chloe Sevigny is great as Jean, the innocent secretary and one of the victims of Bateman's chauvinism, and Willem Defoe was well picked as Detective Donald Kimball.<br/><br/>In short a fantastic movie, worthy of an award (I hope it got one), I thouroughly reccomend it, but dn't expect anything light, it is gory and graphic. the best version is on DVD. Watch it."

","I've seen this movie 2 times, both on TV. The first time I saw this movie, I changed the channel because I couldn't watch this longer then 20 minutes or so. And thats rare, considering I can probably watch the entire LOTR-trilogy without moving a muscle...<br/><br/>The murder-scenes and some of the dialogues (usually before the killing happens) are good though, but its sad that thats just about the only thing I can find entertaining about this movie, especially for a self-proclaimed ""horror""-movie. So basically, if you like horror-movies, skip this movie, because the horror-elements are very rare in this flick.<br/><br/>Also, what is it that people find so funny about this movie...? The only thing that brought a minor smile to my face was the infamous naked chainsaw-chase, but thats it. Maybe its not my kind of humour while others are laughing out loud watching Bateman rant on about 80's pop-music...<br/><br/>Overall this is a nice directed movie, and unusually light and colourfull for a movie about a 'psycho'. But its a shame the writers didn't put any more inspiration and twists in this movie. Now its just a 2 hour snorefest with a few notable dialogues.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm one of those people who ""just don't get it"", but I expect a little more entertainment from a 2 hour movie.<br/><br/>Note for anyone into extreme metal: the Swedish black metal band Shining used one of the dialogues in they'r song ""Claws Of Perdition"" from the album ""The Eerie Cold""."

The novel can be excused its wafer-thin plot as it is a first person narrative of a psychopath.The film doesn't have that luxury and it really requires a better than Christian bale to play such a complex character. It seems director mary harron was unsure about how to film this.On the one hand she has censored all the gore and black comedy which was the novel's raison d'etre yet she casts bale and Willem Dafoe-actors scarcely noted for their subtlety.balein particularly overacts inexcusably- American actors like Ethan Hawke or ben Affleck would have done a much better job. In all the film is lacking in originality.The movie was edited again to remove all the violent bits and like The Avengers or the Kilmer saint flick this subsequent is all too obvious and the movie seems disjointed and unfocussed.perhaps harron was hoping a strong performance from Christian Bale would help but he spends so much time on the tics and mannerisms that he fails to drive the narrative forward and his bateman is simply irritating..more like the office pest than a ruthless serial killer.To be honest i wondered why the female characters liked him so much.He's handsome in a bland way but he lacks the charm and manipulative charisma that I'd envisaged bateman having. All in all this film is a mess.A wasted opportunity.Unlike the book there is no hint as to why bateman commits his crimes and to be honest by halfway through I didn't care.

You have this successful guy with money, a nice girlfriend, lots of friends and lots of pressure he can't bear and for compensation he just walks around, killing homeless people, prostitutes and friends. This was the one movie in a long time I was really upset about; don't get me wrong, I love films like the Scream-Trilogy or The Matrix, films with a lot of blood and violence, but ""American Psycho"" uses violence only for the sake of violence itself, to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic bloodlust.

What kept it interesting was the direction and the acting.  Mary Harron is one a hell of a director--she gets inside her characters' heads and lets us know all about them visually.  The acting is superb--especially Bale.  He's playing a sociopath and a serial killer, but he makes you understand and (believe it or not) actually care for the guy!  Everybody else is great too, but Bale is just incredible.  So, good job all around, but there's no way this could ever be a good movie.  Still, it's worth seeing for the direction and acting.

He and his colleagues are obsessed with having the best items and dining at the trendiest places. In an early scene Patrick and his colleagues compare business cards and he is mortified when one of the others has one which is more tasteful than his, even though they all look virtually identical. Strangely this seems to bother him far more than the fact that people routinely mistake him for other people. He uses this anonymity to invite out a fellow stock broker then murders him with an axe while calmly explaining how he thinks the band Genesis improved under Phil Collins influence. As the film progresses his psychosis deepens and he starts killing more and more people including a homeless man, a model and a prostitute he calls Christie.<br/><br/>It is never one hundred percent certain that he is in fact killing people or if he is just delusional, I used to believe the latter but on later viewings think how he was getting away with his crimes was part of the satire, I liked that there are hints at both possibilities.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's acting in this was superb, he seemed far more chilling than most movie serial killers in that while he is clearly insane he is also no different from those around him on the outside. I also thought Chloë Sevigny acted well as Patrick's secretary, possibly the only really normal person in the film."

","American Psycho is a flaringly unique film that follows the mind warping story of Patrick Bateman. A psychologically troubled man that on the surface is a successful gentleman yet behind the scenes he has alarming temptations that involve blood and torture.<br/><br/>I feel you would be underselling the film to call it a slasher, this is much better than a slasher. This is a psychological investigation of the mind of a deeply troubled individual. Sure there are scenes that nod towards slasher movies but there are also glimpses of inventive, artistic film-making that some how puts us onto the same level of this American Psycho. Empathy it produces? Perhaps. But thats not the point, this shuddering film presents temptation from the inside rather than the outside. This is where this film succeeds and gains its reputation as more than a slasher movie.<br/><br/>Harron's direction is both stirring and comprehensive. Bale proves himself to be a very worthy actor with his adaptation of Ellis' disturbed character. Obsession is all his character is about. Ruthless obsession, taking over his life.<br/><br/>American Psycho is a dynamically original gem of a film that is both coarse and thought provoking 8/10"

","Starring: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon<br/><br/>In 1991, Bret Easton Ellis released his third novel, American Psycho, to a chorus of poor reviews and public uproar. It was a controversial work making a perverse assessment on the state of its times (the late 80s). Its initial publisher, Simon & Schuster, dropped the book just a month before its slated release date. The National Organization of Women threatened to file obscenity lawsuits against the novel, and boycott bookstores carrying it. Ellis's own life was threatened on several occasions. What is surprising then is that it took nearly ten years for it to become a feature film. Even more surprising, that it would eventually be adapted by two women.<br/><br/>That said, Mary Herron, directing from a script she co-wrote with Guinevere Turner, turns in a memorably tense film. From the very first frames of the opening credits, Harron creates great tension as raspberry sauce decorates a dessert, splattering like blood on the white of the plate. Immediately, the tone is set for what's to come.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Bale) is living the American Dream. Or...he should be. He works a high-paying Wall Street job, lives in a pricey uptown apartment, is engaged to a beautiful fiancée (Witherspoon), and is banging her best friend (Samantha Mathis) on the side. The problem? His life is completely empty and soulless. ""I have all the characteristics of a human being,"" he tells us in voice-over, ""but not a single clear, identifiable emotion."" His co-workers think him a loser, and tell him so to his face -- so forgettable is he, they don't even know they're talking to him. One such co-worker, Paul Allen (Jared Leto) leads a remarkably similar life to Bateman's. The difference is, Allen lives it better. His apartment is nicer, the cases he handles are bigger, his fake ""Vice President"" business card is glossier. Not to be outdone, Bateman, a man who strives for perfection and power, lashes out at Allen -- not with words, but with an axe to the face. Allen's ""sudden disappearance"" draws the attention of a private detective (a scene-stealing Dafoe), while Bateman's thirst for bloody mayhem becomes insatiable.<br/><br/>The film holds secrets which I wouldn't dare spoil, and its ending leaves them very open to interpretation. It sticks with you, its ambiguity begging for mental closure. This is a movie worth seeing, for even if you don't like it, there is much left to be discussed.<br/><br/>FINAL SCORE: 8.7 = A- <br/><br/>It seems ironic that Bale would move from Bateman to Batman -- worlds apart, they are held separate by only one letter. Still, Bateman is such an interesting character. Here is a man whose television blares porn as he goes about his business, and slasher flicks as he exercises; who pontificates on the musical strengths of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis while committing brutal murder. Such is the nature of the film: shock and horror, with a side of black comedy. Bale delivers a remarkable performance, and Harron, a brutally mesmerizing masterpiece. I found myself watching much of the film with wide eyes and a hand on my face. Still, I could never quite look away."

","""...their early work was a little too... new wave, for my tastes.. but when sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own - commercially and artistically."" American Psycho is one of the most quotable movies ever made. It's a dark comedy / crime / drama from the year 2000, and of course its main star is Christian Bale. Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment bank executive from New York who has a bit of an ego. It appears, that Bateman is a psychopath and a serial killer, who has all these sick, twisted fantasies and own gruesome ways.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, you're able to see his mind collapse and turn on him, as he goes from killing in control, to being uncontrollable. It's a pretty dark shift, but a very interesting one -- because the movie is, simply put, fantastic. I would have to say, as early as this, that the movie is one of the very best in cinematic history. It's my personal favorite of all time. It's incredible, and Christian Bale is a magnificent actor. He was absolutely brilliant in his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, among many others... but this was, by far, the performance of his life. Nobody could have portrayed Patrick Bateman other than Bale himself, so it was a perfect casting choice for sure.<br/><br/>The movie is dark, funny, violent, and at times can be confusing, but not in a bad way by any means. I would say that American Psycho is one of those movies that, although very, very good, doesn't quite have the total recognition that it so rightfully and so truly deserves. It's got a big large following of fans, though.<br/><br/>It's a must-see film and I can't describe it as meaningfully as I would like to. I believe this is just simply, one of those, ""see for yourself, man!"" movies. It's a once in a lifetime movie, perhaps. It's that damn good! There are so many reasons as to why it's my all time favorite film. It's the perfect film for sure.<br/><br/>Also, its ending? Here's where you may go wrong. You may come off thinking, ""So, it was all in his own head? He was just, like, imagining the whole scenario and stuff?"" Nope. Literally all of it happened (maybe excluding the bank statement thing with the cat.) You see, I can say (since it's spoiler-ticked review), that it all happens because: if you watch the movie, you'll see what these people are like. They're corrupted. They're greedy. They're selfish. They only want what's best for them, nothing more, nothing less. They barely know each other's real names, and don't care enough to find out what's true, what's proper. You know how like, Paul Allen thinks Bateman's name is Marcus Halberstram? That's an example. They don't care to find out what's right from wrong, truth from lies. So when the guy at the end of the film says, to Bateman: ""because I had dinner with Paul Allen, in London, (however many) days ago..."" what if the guy had dinner with who he thought, was Paul Allen? That's what I mean. Patrick would then continue to slip through and escape any cracks which would enclose him, and keep him with life in prison, or the death penalty.<br/><br/>Truly, American Psycho is a remarkable movie. I must-see with so many fantastic moments.<br/><br/>10 / 10 5 / 5"

","""American Psycho"" is one of the absolute greatest films that I've seen recently. It includes almost all of my favorite things that can be included in a film. There's a good soundtrack, dark comedy, satire, disturbing dramatic elements, and some EXCELLENT performances.<br/><br/>While I, of course, love the direction, script, dialogue, etc., Christian Bale's performance may be the absolute highlight of the film. At times, he's really hilarious (in a very odd way), and, at others, he is terrifying. There's some scenes that come across really chilling,solely because of his amazing and threatening performance. This is, without a doubt, the greatest Bale performance of all time. Sure, his performance as Batman is more popular, but, come on! Here, he manages to perfectly capture the film's tone using hilarity and horror, while with Batman he just makes that annoying, weird voice. Sure, Batman has to hide the fact that he's actually Bruce Wayne, but could you choose a better, less silly and over the top voice?<br/><br/>All Batman rants aside, this is one truly excellent film that really impressed me on every possible level."
"owenepps65","9","2","4","28 December 2013"," A modern art masterpiece.
","*warning spoilers* The movie adaptation of American Psycho is constantly neglected for its true worth by the audiences who watch it. The whole movie is based around the concept of ambiguity and the personal identity of the voyeur, therefore I believe this piece to be somewhat spectacular for its message of the society we live in. It focuses heavily on how we focus on the material possessions of a person rather than the aspects of their personality and value. This is especially clear through the business card scene as we see how, through the connotations of the card, Bateman is pressured and feels outdone, this is exactly the intentions as we are witnessing how society makes one become psychologically damaged in the struggle for social hierarchy. It is this idea of becoming the perfect social model, the 'American dream' that drives the insanity of Bateman as he pushes forward into his decent into madness. As far as the plot is concerned it is a fantastic representation of the human mind and more so a psychopathic human mind as we see how he potentially fantasises about killing people. The plot is left ambiguous so it is down to the viewer to change the perspective and look at what they think the ideas to consist of. I believe it is all a fantasy and the closest he got to killing people were the drawings in his notebook, the rest was a concoction of socially strained insanity and boredom in the sense that because he is 'perfect' there is nothing left for him to achieve. This boredom is then left to ferment in his psychotic mind and leaves us with his perspective, after all it is his narration and his story and seeing that he is insane it would be impossible for him to differentiate between his fantasies and reality, therefore giving us as the viewer his perspective.<br/><br/>Relating back to the idea of fantasies, we witness multiple scenes with different themes, one minute we are watching a 'black comedy' full of sharp and horrific humour, then changing to a thriller and then to what some might consider a 'slasher' movie. Although this may appear to be bad editing, it is actually a way of demonstrating the idea of lucid dreaming and how each sequence flows into one and other. This is just a personal belief of mine as I see it fitting to the themes involved. <br/><br/>To top it off the acting is phenomenal, an absolutely outstanding performance by Christian Bale, if it weren't for his acting I may have tuned out, because, as it happens, I was very confused by the initial events, it was only after wards, when thought was put in, that I saw the magnificence that it deserved. If you can truly see this movie for its representations of society and the deterioration of the human mind, as well as its outstanding uses of acting and mise en scene then it will truly blow you away, if still neglectful towards this piece then I urge you, sit up from your seat, the director has placed you there purposefully so that you are confused, they have given you an obscure angle, all you have to do is take the confidence to look from another angle, only then will you understand the true meaning, purpose and depth to this movie. It is a catchy artistic and well played performance, but more than that it is a beautifully mastered representation of the world we live in and how, if not careful, we can be trapped in the insanity induced nightmare of modern society.<br/><br/>A truly beautiful work of art, both the author and the director deserve the audiences attention for such a sterling effort, very well done."
"ShiiStyle","10","2","4","11 June 2011"," A deeply incisive and satisfying film
","There's no need for another review of this film but I just had to write one to give it the praise it deserves. All the dark things bubbling beneath the Wall Street psyche, and the American upper class psyche in general, are raised to the surface with this film. It feels clear to me that all the executives shown in the film are very similar to Bateman, only their sociopathy is better hidden, obscured even to themselves. In Bateman the inner chaos battles for control with reality. He tells us that what's inside his head doesn't matter, but of course the inside and outside are blending together, driving his life out of control. What this film accomplishes is very rare. It approximates a message about the modern era without having to stick on some morality play or quest for political redemption (because, after all, on Wall Street today there is still no salvation). I was very happy to watch it."
"gutsy_gibbon","10","2","4","22 May 2011"," A grim satire of Wall Street-based society
","A successful executive, Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) is a typical Wall Street financial top dog. He likes and does all the typical things Wall Street people do: parties, drugs, living in posh apartments and so on. However, as the title suggests, Bateman has another thing he likes to do: he is a psychopathic murderer. <br/><br/>This satirical black comedy demonstrates some of the realities of the modern Wall Street-based society. Although it is not clear if the author of the novel intends it (not having read the novel), the story could be interpreted as a story of Wall Street executives literally getting away with murder. It may not be that the Wall Street executives are particularly ""evil"" people themselves, but because of their class position, the executives wield enormous amounts of power and privilege. Thus, it is very instructive when Bateman finds out that nobody wants to believe his confessions of a uber-privileged executive being a serial killer on the side. Also, the behavior of law enforcement when it confronts him is markedly different with all deference being offered to him as a mark of his exalted position and in the end, it is not clear if law enforcement would ever be interested in having justice served to him, but it is clear from one of the last scenes, where he shows his own incredulity at his lawyer laughing off his sordid confessions, that Bateman ironically realizes his own hyper-privileged position pretty much absolves him of any crimes of mass murder he may want to continue to commit."

","American PSYCHO features Christian Bale playing Patrick Bateman, a rich man with a huge ego who is also a psychopath. Christian Bale plays this role brilliantly, delivering great lines, and giving the audience a character that both frightens, disturbs and entertains at the same time. Performances, although minor by other characters such as Jared Leto and Reese Witherspoon are also good too. <br/><br/>Featuring enough pop culture references, it avoids being pretentious by instead of making the film appear cultured, it gives depth to the character and by that, making him more terrifying. The screenplay captures the want for wealth and money so well that the film becomes painfully realistic. Although this may never be the case because it is hard to relate to Bateman's hatred for all forms of life, it does present the characters as being wealth- obsessed and smug, but most importantly, how impossible it is to hide a hatred. Despite the over-the top violence, the deliberately cheesy lines and the exercise scenes featuring Christian Bale that seems to have been copy and pasted out from an infomercial, never does this film seem fake in any context.<br/><br/>The film does fall short of being sometimes direction less in its aims and a lot of violence does seem for shock value. People may find it to be emotionally vapid at times, due to its lack of morals or convictions, but American Psycho is recommended due to its realism and performances"

Patrick Bateman is a guy obsessed with having the best looks, apartment, business card!, ..all the material pleasures. Just like the book the story is narrated in first person, an account of how he spends in day getting through work hours and how he is a serial killer by night. The murders are graphic and the sex scenes are brutal. The murders after the sex scenes are both. Chainsaw, axes, knives... some of the few. Brilliant performance by Bale, so many characteristics portrayed together: arrogance, obsession, passion(for murders), remorse(at the end), and so many more.<br/><br/>But the part part is the end. Don't wanna reveal anything about it, but you will be thinking about it for a long long time after you've seen this movie the first time. A must watch for any movie buff!"

","American Psycho is a twisted very well made thriller with a knock out performance by Christian Bale from Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Prestige, and most recently Terminator Salvation. The rest of the cast including William Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis, and Reese Witherspoon in a small role turn in good performances but it's Bale who stands out amongst them. I won't say anything about the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet except that American Psycho is a thriller with some touches of dark humor powered by a great performance by Christian Bale as a wealthy New York banking executive with a taste for homicidal activities. The movie is definitely weird and different but in a good way. Director Mary Harron does a good job of bringing this film to the big screen and doing justice to the book. Well done. The film does contain strong violence, some graphic sex scenes, drug use, and strong language so parents should be warned before watching this with their kids. Overall American Psycho was much better that expected and most of that is because of the fantastic performance by Christian Bale who continues to show Hollywood why he's one of Hollywoods best actors. If you're in the mood to watch a good movie that's entertaining, different, and with some dark humor you can't go wrong with American Psycho. It's one movie among many that will not disappoint."

"Det_McNulty","8","2","4","25 February 2008"," A Cynical Social-Commentary, and One Which Is Irresistibly Relevant For Today's World
","Christian Bale is arguably modern cinema's most underrated actor. I sometimes consider hailing him as the greatest performer of this generation, particularly whenever I re-watch his leap-to-fame performance in American Psycho. On its release it erroneously received mixed acclaim; nevertheless, Bale was nearly always commended for performing in the remarkably charismatic role of Patrick Bateman. The character ranks among contemporary literature's greatest creations, and back in 2000 a young Bale somehow managed to embody the yuppie maniac. The character's slickly menacing demeanour, attentive idiosyncrasies, and always brewing revulsion is intuitively mastered in this offbeat satire. Patrick Bateman is both the definitive New York yuppie and the ultimate sociopath. He is masked by the Wall Street businessman persona, and his pastime activities are unnoticed by his self-obsessed associates- like himself. He thrives off a colossal maze of jealously, established on distaste for any minor, physical and social hiccup. Little do such men know that they are dehumanising any merit they once had.<br/><br/>Bret Easton Ellis' original novel contains possibly the most graphic depictions of sex and violence in any novel I have ever read. Appropriately, director Mary Harron places much of the novel's explicit content off-screen, similar to how the book simply lets the reader imagine the vivid nature of the content. For this reason, American Psycho is faithful to its source, and for a novel which includes such terminal violence there is still a huge amount of wit and charm. This owes to the book's satirical disposition, with its brazen accuracy and jagged humour. It is in many respects an absurdist's take on an already surreal culture; this lends the questionable theme of subjective reality to the protagonist's actions and experiences. Mary Harron utilises the satirical facets of the novel, and essentially uses satire as a device of ridiculing yuppie culture. Nevertheless, the component which is best suited is that this image of an alpha-male dominated society, which is directed from a female standpoint, but not an overtly feminist one. More than anything, American Psycho is a critique of ignorance, materialism and self-infatuation.<br/><br/>The cast play it cool throughout the feature, concurrently sinking their teeth into the bitter irony of cultural stereotypes. For those of you who might be put off by the sardonic title; don't be. This is a twisted and intelligent take on cultural archetypes, with much prominence being placed on whether the viewer deems Patrick Bateman's sociopath alter-ego a manifestation of sub-conscious monotony or that he is genuinely committing the murderous, masochistic acts shown on screen. Whichever way you look at it, there is no definitive answer, but one thing is for sure, that this cinematic assertion is a strong sentiment of yuppie narcissism. As dark as it may seem, there is no denying the indisputable entertainment quality of a film crammed with meaningful malevolence. This is a film which unsympathetically attacks the business world, implying that dumb people from wealthy backgrounds are groomed for slacker success. These white collar machines are not savvy, nor do they even so much as turn a blind-eye to anyone other than their materialistic statements of self-worth. In a way, this is their only means of clinging onto reality, for they hide behind their denial, with a reputable image of self-worth."

It takes Ellis's gore factor away slightly, not much, but slightly, and puts a little more suggestion in.<br/><br/>What's also in there, is the dark, dark humour of the book, which can be lost when some novels get the Hollywood treatment.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good movie.

","American Psycho is way better than Psycho.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock passed on American Psycho in favor of Psycho because American Psycho was too American for him.

But given the 40 year window of their release dates; it's now Norman who is Patrick's father. Which probably works better; like Luke in Starwars the force is stronger in Patrick and he becomes a better psycho than his father. BUT both the bates are good its just Patrick is the better bate's man.<br/><br/>American Psycho is the must see film of the decade. I haven't seen a better constructed; intellectually executed slasher film since before the genre was incepted.

The whole movie has a clear crisp '80s look, and a new sheen of social satire, which really gives the movie a big boost. In terms of writing craftsmanship, the sheer scriptwriting, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism. The movie is so catchy, most people don't even try to understand the meaning, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, importance of trends, hollow yuppie lifestyle and murders, but it's also a personal statement of a director herself!<br/><br/>Do you like Christian Bale?<br/><br/>I've been a big Bale fan since the release of his '94 movie ""Prince of Jutland"". Before that, I really didn't understand any of his work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on ""Prince of Jutland"" where Christian Bale's presence became more apparent. I think ""American Psycho"" is Bale's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding movies. His acting is as positive and affirmative as anything I've seen in any movie. <br/><br/>The brilliant ensemble of other actors makes ""American Psycho"" great,great movie, a personal favourite. You can practically sense the empathy between Bale, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, the movie is extremely uplifting, it shines with hope that it's not too late to better ourselves, and contains a crucial message - since it's impossible in this world we live in, to empathise with others, we always empathise with ourselves. It's beautifully stated in the movie. And now excuse me, I have to return some videotapes."

","This is a magnificent movie. It is absolutely a brilliant masterpiece, put together by the director and Christian Bale. As of this movie i placed Cristian Bale on top of my favorites actors list. The man is simply glowing in this part, but i recommend that you also watch: Equilibrium, The Machinist.... Absolutely clear psychological study of the modern man that seeks knowledge of himself, but it is limited by the petty things in actual today's city life. A study about pain and will to reflect one's pain on others. Emil Cioran said in ""Pe Culmile Disperararii"" that: 'my pain, no matter how deep it is, is no greater that the pain of my alike' What greater enlightening experience is there, if not the thrill of the kill...?"

","I think this is the best adaptation of a Bret Eston Ellis's book (and maybe the most adaptable). This yuppie representation of a serial killer, is an unforgettable event and could be the best interpretation by Christian Bale. Christian Bale always build his body according to the role (you think Leonardo Di Caprio could look like that), you have to see ""The Machinist"" to confirm it, and then he returns to his original shape with Batman Begins, etc., but this is a very introspective job and you can tell how well he was communicating with his director, the one and only Mary Harron.

He delivers every line in a way which makes every second of the movie so enjoyable to watch. I have to credit the screenplay though with giving Bale incredible line after line. The ending is the biggest complaint for this movie but even if you hate the ending the other 96 minutes of pure enjoyment should out weigh the 45 seconds of ending.

His schedule book was not at all explained: did he have a schizophrenic (sp?) disorder or was he really sick? Perhaps we are to figure it out, but the rest of the movie does not help. It moves from one proposterous scene of businessmen trying to prove their penis size to a scene of violence and back again in a cycle.

"isadorasdiary","Null","2","4","28 February 2001"," Reasons why AP is a good study of serial killers and why Kafka would be proud
","Sorry, some spoilers:<br/><br/>My first reaction to the movie was that, though I personally found it very absorbing, I walked away not understanding why Patrick Bateman was a serial killer in the first place. I now think this is mainly because we get no peek into Bateman's child life, but I don't think that's necessary to the story and would have probably ruined it.  I came up with some reasons why Bateman is a believable serial killer.  Support from the movie is given with each reason:<br/><br/>1/ Serial killers are notably superficial, though not often described this way.  This can be said especially of male serial killers, who typically kill randomly, without regard for any personal relationship with the victim.<br/><br/>Bateman: A large part of the movie was showing how the superficiality of 80's corporate society and serial killing are strangely resonant.  One theorist of serial killers, thinking before *American Psycho,* uses a metaphor to understand their psyche: that they are basically a black hole. Once they get started killing, their personality just gets sucked into non-existence, into a sort of black hole.  Sometimes, they scramble to regain that personality, the memories, attitudes, experiences and personal relationships that made them unique and gave their life long term meaning, meaning beyond the next kill, but after the slayings pile up, this becomes quite difficult.  Reminds me of Bateman.<br/><br/>2/ Serial killers often attack prostitutes, since they're easy nocturnal targets, and the killing is usually predominantly sexually motivated as well.<br/><br/>Bateman killed hookers.<br/><br/>3/ Serial killers are generally unable to explain why they do what they do. <br/><br/>
Bateman couldn't help doodling death scenes, so preoccupied was he.  Also, in his phone confession toward the end of the movie, Bateman realized how basically compulsive it was for him to kill, that he just keeps wanting to do it and does it, there being no other reason really that he could think of.<br/><br/>4/ Though rarely able to explain their bloodthirsty desires and actions, Ted Bundy, when interviewed about it, came up with a ""possession"" theory. Killing his young female victims was like the ultimate possession of them.<br/><br/>Bateman displayed a marked obsession with possessions.  Major theme of the movie.<br/><br/>5/ Ted Bundy was charismatic and smart, too, and even acted as his own defense attorney.<br/><br/>So, it's not impossible that Bateman could be a serial killer with very, at least, surface social traits and also function in a corporate environment that places demands on one's intelligence and focus, while at the same time killing regularly.<br/><br/>6/ Serial killers often feel like people are out to get them and/or feel superior to others.<br/><br/>Bateman had these sorts of experience and attitudes within the corporate environment and acted on them lethally.<br/><br/>7/ Serial killers are typically not ""insane,"" which connotes that they can't in any way understand that what they're doing is wrong.  Rather, serial killers are typically ""psychopathic"" and are prone to feelings of regret, even if they tend for the most part to feel justified.  Their conscience often returns most strongly, if it does, when the cops catch up.<br/><br/>Bateman had a great need to confess after the cops chased him.<br/><br/>
These are just a few reasons for believing *American Psycho* could be thought of as an accurate portrayal of the psychopathic serial killer.  I haven't read the book, but I suspect that the psychology would be even better explored there.  Even if Bateman is peculiarly different from past serial killers, each serial killer is different, and serial killers do evolve with society.  I think this movie goes beyond previous slasher films in psychological insight, maybe beyond Stone's *Natural Born Killers,* too.<br/><br/>Final note on literary parallels (here's the real spoiler).  In the end, Bateman has the need to confess, but is unable to gain recognition for his guilt.  The satisfaction of confession is prevented because the level of superficiality is so high in his corporate subculture that no one is certain who's who anyway.  So, who's the killer?  And what's it mean to say, ""I am""? The meaningless, grotesque superficiality of the work place and the confusing misplacement of guilt and punishment are themes reminiscent of Kafka's work, say ""Metamorphosis"" and *The Trial.*  If you asked, ""What's the point?"" of Kafka's stuff, you're probably asking that about this movie too."

Having said that this movie was fun if really distrubing to watch during most of it's run time as it had a script that blended suspenceful and terrifying scenes superbly. There was also several great comedic and dramatic scenes some of which related to the 1980s decade and the things that went on then both good and bad. But there were factual errors however all of the actors did a great job in their roles. The cimematography had continuity errors and mistakes plus unfortunately it was filmed partially in Canada. The special effects were excellent considering when this movie was made and the soundtrack was awesome to listen to. Also on the DVD that I watched there were two outstanding commentaries along with deleted scenes that had a commentary track also all of which are worth listening to.

"adeckofcards","6","0","0","26 June 2020"," Criminal satire
","When you think about a tape about a psychopath, a violent drama-like story instantly comes to mind. In 'American Psycho' this totally changes, when reporting criminal acts in a satirical way.
The film tells the story of Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street worker who murders people at night. The greatest achievement of the film is the development of the main character. The story, being told from its subjective point of view, acquires an absolutely well-made introspection. Unfortunately it is one of the few good things it achieves. The script is pretty weak, so weak that at its end point it can't support itself and leaves plenty of holes behind. This same script risks everything to develop the protagonist and leaves out all the other characters, with minimal development.
Generally speaking, the film doesn't have much more to offer than a well-developed character and the odd funny sequence, even if it's totally ridiculous and implausible. Although, despite everything, the performance of Christian Bale (even without being the best of his career) manages to enhance a rather weak film."

"dillylamar","10","0","0","24 June 2020"," American Psycho
","American Psycho is a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron, adapted for the screen by Mary Harron, and based off of the novel of the same name. This film is a cult classic, as it's dark humor, ridiculousness, bloody violence, horror film traits, and insanely quotable moments mix well with its satire and criqie of collective identity, individuality consumerism, capitalism, and yuppie culture. Bale's breakout performance in the film is absolutely phenomenal and iconic. The main themes of the film are lack of individuality, collective identity becoming personal identity, the greed and self indulgence of those in high society, and what a psychopath can get away with in a world like this. All of the men on Wall street look and act the exact same. They are interchangeable, as are the women. That's why people constantly get names mixed up in the film, and that ends up saving Bateman. Bateman only cares about other view him. He is in a constant hunger for conformity and to be seen as better, as he ends up killing Paul Allen because he had a better business card than him. He has been killing for a long time, and has been able to maintain, but starts to breakdown. The film is about how we form a collective identity, pretty much losing our individuality and personal identity. We crave attention, material wealth, conformity and to be seen as better. Bateman does. So do the others. At the end of the film he realizes that nothing including himself really matter, everyone is the same. He is so indulged in a collective identity, that his lawyer mistakes him for someone else, obliterating his confession. No one cares that he kills people, no one even notices. He can get away with anything, even if your a serial killer/psychopath. because he has sold himself a collective identity. He puts value into material things like restaurants, suits, watches, cards, and apartments. He listens to cheesy pop music because its trendy, but much more value into it, than it really holds. He views the homeless and lower classes to be less than him, he just kills them. In this type of high society, the people lose their individuality and distungishable traits, and just become greedy, power hungry, emotionless, interchangeable and unoticable nothings. The only difference between Bateman and his banker colleagues, is that he kills people. But everyone is so wrapped up in themselves and collective identity, that they dont notice. Bateman sees women as meat or objects, and men as something to be better than.At the end of the film, after his breakdown, Bateman realize that he and everyone else he knows is meaningless, interchangeable, and that he can get away with anything. He can Indulge in his murderous hunger all he wants. He presents himself in the collective identity, fitting in losing all sense of self. It will go on. He becomes more and more hungry and uncontrollable and his private life becomes integrated into his professional, and he realizes that he take it, and get away with it, there is more to take. Don' become a Patrick Bateman. He craves to stand out and be better. His view of himself is skewed by his psychosis, inflated ego and sociopatheology. His fantasy and reality become jaded, mixed, and goes insane because he can't really tell the difference. His killings all happend, but some are partial truths, or over aesthetically elaborate type chainsaw massacre killings. He so disconnected and detached from reality."

","I had heard great things about this movie, but after watching I felt as though it was just another average psychological movie. Christian Bale's performance was commendable and brilliant, as was the other actor's. However, the ending of the film made out that all of the violence and murder committed throughout was in Patrick's head and never actually occurred. I think the film would've worked better if we see Patrick get away with what he did, and continue to kill undiscovered, as it would show how hidden things in life are. Some of the relationships and behaviours in the film were very bazaar and not expected, and unusually Patrick seemed to be one of the more normal characters, which was certainly not the aim of film. Overall, it was a good movie, with great acting, and good murder scenes."

","American Psycho, based on a novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis, is a story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), an investment banker on the Wall Street, whose life revolves around a few things. Looking good, one-upping his coworkers and listening to music. Only, he does all of these things in the most destructive, psychotic and capitalistic way possible. The movie is nothing if not a look into the psyche of a seriously disturbed man, who also happens to stand in for the rottenness of modern society.<br/><br/>Most of the good things in the film can be summed up in two words: Christian Bale. One of the defining roles of his career, and the man absolutely nails the outwardly pleasant high-lifer, who nonetheless has the eyes of a dead man. Whenever he smiles it sends shivers down your spine because even though it looks alright, there's something messed up behind it. And then there are those scenes where his inner psycho comes out to play. Freaky stuff.<br/><br/>Not that the other aspect of film making are lacking. It's a well-shot, well-acted, well-made film all around. But it's really Bale's performance that elevates this above the crowd. Well, that and the themes explored, but there are other films that have dealt with similar issues equally well, if not better.<br/><br/>A movie well worth a watch.

","***FIRST 3 PARAGRAPHS SPOLIER FREE***
I quickly realized this movie was not any sort of commentary about mental health and/or one's decent to such a level that Patrick Bateman is. It is more of a focused character study of a serial killer.<br/><br/>The movie puts you right in the shoes of this man (played very well by Christian Bale) and bluntly lays out his attitude and desires from the start. His very unsettling behavior contrasted with his wealthy lifestyle make for some great scenes, such as the ""morning routine"".<br/><br/>All of this plays in to an interesting look at wealthy American culture as a whole. Of course not all rich people are horrible, but the fact that his co-workers/peers are too concerned with themselves and their life to take notice of some of the strange things he does says something about these environments, albiet not something profound or moving in my opinion.<br/><br/>***SPOLIER SECTION (And my main complaint with the movie)****
I decided I need to talk about the ending for this to be a complete review. Everyone has a right to be confused with it. While some seem to think it's brilliant, I don't completely agree.<br/><br/>It portrays very very ambiguously that perhaps some of, most of, or possibly all of these murders and atrocities he was comminting were imaginary or exaggerated in his mind. It's very unclear. There was some moments eluding to this idea. There are several points in the movie where he does or says something very odd. It's not enough to throw off the other characters, but it is enough for the audience will question what they just saw was for real. Of course things in that ending sequence were definitely imagined, and that leaves the audience to question if other things were too.<br/><br/>My problem is that it was too ambiguous. If he really is just imaging these things in his head, that hurts the impact of these horrible murders we just witnessed, and therefore the entire movie. I like how he appeared to fear being caught. I liked how it seemed that he maybe wants to confess deep down. But I can't determine for sure if those things were real either. Patrick Bateman is the only perspective you have in this movie, which is overall a good direction choice. But here, it leaves too many question marks for me to say it leaves a significant lasting impression.<br/><br/>That said, I completely respect ones opinion that the ending adds to the rest of the movie. Even with that, I'm still giving it a 7/10, which is above average on my scale."

Playing the main role as Patrick Bateman he carries the show forward through murder and despise, in a film that is set to cause horror amongst viewers.<br/><br/>Even though Bale is the standout performer, other small roles like Willem Dafoe's character Donald Kimball and Stephen Bogaert as the lawyer Harold Carnes, all help to create the unsettling and tense nature of the film. It's an aura that constantly keeps the watchers at unease, making them feel the same way as Patrick about his cowerkers: That they indeed are pretentious self-focused phonies.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this film is the neat and clever use of sound effects, such as the famous scene where Patrick and his coworkers compete over who has the finest business card, where you can her small ""whooshes"" and flings as they show each other their cards. And even the neat sounds coming from their expensive shoes as they walk down the street. Neat is a great word to summarise thia film, and it is neat in more ways than the sound effects. From the previously mentioned nice looking business cards and the shiny leather shoes, to Patricks shower routines and his and his cowerkers visits to keen restaurants.<br/><br/>The cinematography and lightning of this film is also very good, making every scene that much more frightning and that much more good looking. The tone of lightning in this film is consistent and also the tone of the film itself, further emphasising the neat feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>The most spectacular thing about this movie though, is the uncertainty placed in Patricks visions and behaviour. It is clear that he is not psychologically well, and carries som clear anger issues. But is he really capable of murder? Does everything really unfold as he perceives it? The viewer only ever gets to see his perspective and one begins to wonder how much of it is actually real. This uncertainty is great, and in the end, the viewer is left wondering who Patrick Bateman really is, and what actually happened.<br/><br/>The downside of this film is perhaps that it didn't hit as hard as it could have. It touches the edge of a masterpiece, but just falls short due to the way it impacts the viewer; not as much as it could have. It is true that it is a great story, with great acting, but it didn't make you feel that discombobulated or perplexed or astound, especially the ending, which is no way bad, infact it is really great, it just didn't impact the same way other movies have, such as Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island or Christopher Nolan's memento.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a fine piece of a movie, with great acting, a great story, and a great conclusion, making for the perhaps neatest film of all time. Well that played to Mary Harron!"

","Don't let the fact that it's about a psychopathic serial killer fool you -- It's anything but a slasher flick. You won't know what to make of it once you are done watching. In fact, what the film is really about is hard to pin down. You will feel that you have learned something, but what exactly? Wall Street scum? Rampant narcissism?<br/><br/>As far is the source material is concerned, it's watered down just enough to give it a realistic opportunity of screening in theaters without being tossed outta the window. Keeping such things in mind, I'm confident enough to call it the most faithful adaptation possible without inducing vomit.<br/><br/>This exploratory film treks through so many levels. While it delves into the mind of a psychopath, it also simultaneously manages to somehow represent the ills of modern society on screen. Valuing matter over mind, the empty social consumerism, empty words, empty lives, an empty people. It would make a Wall Street corporate yuppie uncomfortable, while those who are too far gone might just even relate.<br/><br/>The voice-over dialogue adds to the film's already potent thematics, invoking a better look at the psychopath's mind and inner turmoil. The abstractions and confession-like style pays tribute to Wall Street ills. Yet the tongue-in-cheek tone keeps the portrayed social horrors from getting too heavy.<br/><br/>The highlight however is Christian Bale's portrayal of the lead narcissist, Patrick Bateman. There is an intense focus on vanity and appearances involving effeminate morning routines and insistent workouts. The high status he has made for himself provides an eerily effective buffer between his outer appearance and inner turmoils, blending well into his equally shallow peers. A bit too well in fact, unwittingly emphasizing the not-so-stellar performances by the support characters. While Christian Bale's fascinating performance stands well against the rest of the cast, it is hard to tell if he was born to play narcissists and psychopaths or if he butchered the role (no pun intended). The shallowness of his expressions is remarkable, but not particularly terrifying. Whether it was Oscar worthy or not, I leave up to you.<br/><br/>While the film (especially the ending) leaves something to be desired, the pioneering aspect does make up for some of it. Nearly two decades later, the film still feels relevant and will continue alluding to film connoisseurs further still."

","American Psycho is one of the few films that appears in both in Chris Stuckmann's book, The Film Buff's Bucket List (top 50 films of 2000 to 2015) and the 100 Movie Bucket List scratch off poster. So I get to mark off two at once! I'm fascinated by Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman. It's a performance that really made me take note of Bale over twenty years ago and he remains an actor to watch to this day. This film is categorized as crime drama, but I've always seen it as a psychological thriller and, I don't know what this says about me, a dark comedy. Now, if you'll excuse me... I have to return some video tapes."

","I felt this film was very well done. The direction was brilliant as was the acting. Christian Bale shone as Patrick Bateman creating a tense and unnerving tone. Whilst having a great story, the off screen violence distracts from the story, making it more difficult to see things from Patrick's point of view. I feel this makes the character a bit distant with the audience and prevents any kind of bond or understanding with him."

","There are two threads I see running through the negative reviews of this movie - one disappointing, and one understandable.<br/><br/>1. This is not a horror film in the traditional sense and was never meant to be. If you are judging it on that basis, you have completely missed the point. This is disappointing because you overlooking what is truly satisfying about the film.<br/><br/>2. The movie is hilarious! But comedy is subjective, so you can't blame a person who does not get or like satire or black comedy. That is understandable because it is a matter of taste. If so, this film just wasn't for you.<br/><br/>One last comment. I suppose it is a product of the two points above, but I still find it hard to believe that anyone watched this film and was not impressed with Christian Bale. He nailed the character right down to the smallest nuance, and he was entertaining every moment he was on the screen. In my opinion, it is one of his 2-3 best performances as an actor, if not his best.<br/><br/>All that said, the move was not perfect. 8/10"

","'American Psycho (2000)' an interesting and unsettling film that is never as straightforward as it initially seems to be. It becomes quite frustrating in its determination to not provide answers in the way in which you expect it to, though this is ultimately a strength of the piece. The watch is an uncomfortable one that uses its comedy as a tool to make you squirm rather than laugh, to wonder why such dark material is played with such a strange tone rather than chuckle along with our killer protagonist, and the 'funniest' stuff is actually the smart underlayer of satire that roots the picture in a knowing world of its own. The plastic smiles of self-important businessmen are there to be examined on a much deeper and slyer level than you'd perhaps expect, before they're carved off with a chainsaw accompanied by all the bloody B-movie splendour you could imagine. 6/10"

","In New York, the narcissist investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works in the bank of his fiancÃ©e's father and usually has dinner with his shallow coworkers at fashionable and expensive restaurants. Bateman worships notorious serial-killers, such as Ed Gein or Ted Bundy, and he is a psychopath. When his co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) shows a business card of better quality than his, Bateman plots to kill him using the name of another colleague. He murders Paul with an ax and tapes a message in his answering machine telling that Paul is travelling to London. Soon the private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) investigates Paul's disappearance and interviews Bateman. Then Bateman hires two prostitutes to spend the night with him doing kinky sex and he tortures the women. Bateman tries to kill a homosexual co-worker; murders a model; and tries to kill his own secretary.

","Psychopathy in the super yuppie 1980s financial district, where a wolf in sheep's clothing runs rampant through the sea of fake grins and phony networking events. Christian Bale really made his name as a leading man in the role of Patrick Bateman, a move that looks bold and prescient in hindsight as many warned it would be career suicide. He's the motor behind this story, on-screen for basically the duration, and able to balance scenes of dark, black humor with later episodes that require him to come completely unhinged. The first hour is unspeakably funny, engulfing us in Bateman's daily ritual and knee-jerk lust for violence, in the masks he wears to pass muster and the hopelessly superficial assholes he hangs around with. It's absolutely loaded with classic scenes and quotable lines, like ""Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?"", ""Don't just stare at it, eat it"" and ""My god, it's even got a watermark"" and I could joyfully revisit any one of those snippets at the drop of a hat. Every time we start to think it's okay to cheer the serial killer, though, he pulls a blood-chilling stunt that makes us question our own judgment. As the film unfolds, he grows increasingly sloppy, desperately chasing the dragon until he's in so deep that there seems to be no escape. The climax is a big tonal swing, and though it flirts with the idea of a wild twist at the very end, a lot is left to the viewer and I don't think it completely arrives where it means to. Still, it's a relentlessly entertaining movie that toys with a broad range of emotions and gives us one of the decade's most memorable performances. I could watch this just about any time."

My attention was solely on the psycho, and what I loved most was every part of his ongoing ridiculousness.

We're not entertained now, we realize what he's actually doing.

","Kids, Bruce Wayne was a serial killer 5 years before he became Batman. Remember that. <br/><br/>This movie is very brutal and creepy in pretty much all aspects. Patrick Bateman is a materialistic and shallow Wall Street dude by day and a murderer by night and his attitude doesn't even change much. None of the other characters seem to honestly care about him, nor does he care about them. However, the supporting cast still helps to build the atmosphere a lot and add to the story. He fits so well into his Wall Street life that nobody considers him to stand out. I don't class this as a horror film, but it is still graphic.<br/><br/>After Bateman kills his first major victim in Paul Allen (Jared Letohnonobodycaresaboutyou) in a spectacular fashion (with older music accompanying him; a running theme), you assume that Bateman's experienced with cleaning up murders, given how well he does it to Allen. When the detective (Willem Dafoe, the Green Goblin from the original Spider Man films) arrives, you wonder how Bateman doesn't immediately trigger so many alarm bells. <br/><br/>The conversations that Bateman has within his head are so fitting and very well written and add quite a lot to his character. Christian Bale's (at the head of two movies with 'American' in the title despite being English) performance is brilliant to the point where I have to give it its own rating of probably an 8.7/10. Patrick Bateman has been put alongside my favourite movie characters. He's a cool lunatic who just kills people in an insanely unique way."

During the day, he is an almost perfect male, working at his father's company and hanging out with his buddies, while during the night, he satisfies his gruesome pleasures and lust for blood by killing random people.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, his thirst begins to grow so it becomes increasingly hard to control himself in the presence of other people. Almost any motif is good enough to kill so he thoroughly plans his every move until one day when the situation gets truly out of control so a real massacre is about to occur.

Christian Bale is a great actor and he plays his role with style but unfortunately for me, this is one of those movies I cannot enjoy due to its senseless murdering and its course of events which ultimately lead to an abrupt ending without consequences.<br/><br/>This movie is all about brutal violence, sex and social envy, so if you're into this type of movies, this is for you.

"Marthian80","7","0","0","14 July 2017"," Good movie about a man who blurs between reality and fantasy
","American Psycho's story is about a young banker named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who at age 27 has it all: a high position in his dad's company, a very expensive apartment in the heart of New York City, he's very handsome, is engaged to a beautiful woman (with a few girls on the side..) and he likes to kill random people because he likes it... Yes our Patrick is actually very unhappy about his life and claims he doesn't feel empathy or love at all. He's so out of touch with humanity that several people mistake him for someone else, even people he knows for years. His only escape out of his life of wealth and power are his fantasies of sex and violence and acting out on it. But how long can he go on without people suspecting something? Or is everyone so busy with boosting their own ego's that they fail to notice that there is a psycho in their midst? <br/><br/>This movie does a good job in displaying how a mind as twisted as Patrick Bateman works and how he is on a downward spiral as the lines between his violent dreams and reality get more and more blurry. I was impressed with Bale's performance, especially the scene where he breaks down and calls his lawyer and when he is going full blown crazy running around with a chainsaw. The rest of the cast also does a fine job in portraying the rich snobs and dumb girls that circle around Bateman. The only voice of reason and the only person who shows empathy is Bateman's secretary (excellent performance by Chloe Sevigny), I really liked her role in the movie. <br/><br/>The movie started a bit slow though, the first 45 minutes could be chopped in half because some parts don't add much and are a bit dragged out. It also didn't feel like the 1980's, I was often wondering what the time period was supposed to be, despite the excellent 80's soundtrack. And I couldn't help but compare this movie with another story about a psychopath: Clockwork Orange, one of my favorite movies of all time. But I guess it takes a movie maker like Kubrick to really show how the mind of a psycho works. But like clockwork orange, this movie ending get's you thinking. It leaves it up to the viewer how to interpret-ate the events that happened.<br/><br/>So all in all a good movie with a great performance of Christian Bale. Definitely check it out if you like movies about crazy people and don't mind a few violent/sexual scenes."

Not to mention that scene where he looks at his own gorgeously toned body in the mirror while having sex two ill-fated women.)<br/><br/>The role of the unreliable narrator is also very interesting. By the end of the film, the movie's comedic elements are coming to the fore as the audience comes to realize that the phantasmagoria of sex and violence was more fantasy than reality.<br/><br/>I have very mixed feelings about the movie as a whole.

"Aly200","7","0","0","7 February 2017"," An Interesting Look into the Dark Side of Yuppie Culture
","Based on the controversial bestselling novel by Bret Easton Ellis, this terrifying film remains a constantly debated masterpiece of early 21st century cinema. A notable first for the film's success being directed by a woman and secondly for the intense and insane performance by Christian Bale as the titular psycho, it is sometimes difficult to remember why the film has a bit of a cult following.<br/><br/>There is so much to say about the bravado performance of Christian Bale in the pivotal role of Patrick Bateman, an arrogant and unstable Wall Street broker, but also difficult to describe the insanity that ensues. While A- list star Leonardo DiCaprio was the first choice for the part, the actor passed on the dark subject matter and the previously fired (the filmmakers weren't convinced that the little known Christian was right for the part) Bale was called back to take over the role he had lost out on. Channeling charisma equivalent to acting superstar Tom Cruise (Bale and other crew members stated in interviews that he did model his look for Bateman on the A-list star) while masking a wicked secret, Bale keeps himself restrained as much as possible until the madness suddenly erupts like a volcano. Take for instance the infamous ax murder to the song 'Hip to Be Square' by Huey Lewis and the News, where Bale is as calm and friendly as can be until he unleashes his hatred for Jared Leto's Paul Allen in a gleefully maniacal rage and hacks the character to death. The madness only escalates as Bale's Bateman falls even further into insanity, but is he really a homicidal maniac or is he a delusional madman?<br/><br/>The film boasts a stellar supporting cast of players who all play unique parts within the narrative. Aforementioned future Oscar winner Jared Leto is Paul Allen, a fellow broker and the first victim of Bateman's wickedness to harm his fellow man, Samantha Mathis as an ill-fated friend of Bateman's, Willem Dafoe as a FBI man who is looking into the fate of Leto's Paul Allen, Chloe Sevigny as Patrick's compassionate secretary who finds out what a monster Bateman might be and future Oscar winning actress Reese Witherspoon is Bateman's clueless and wealth-obsessed fiancé. <br/><br/>Under the careful direction of Mary Harron, the film maintains an ambiguity that is needed for the narrative. We see everything through Patrick Bateman's eyes, which provides us with an unreliable narrator. Given that we do see his heinous crimes as he commits them, we are inclined to believe that Patrick has been telling us the truth, but when the film's ending hits we the audience are thrown for a loop. Was everything real, did the murders actually or was it the confessions of a mentally unstable lunatic? The question is left unanswered and lingering in our minds after the credits roll. <br/><br/>The movie does eliminate some of the book's more horrific elements like the implication of cannibalism and some of the on-screen violence is also toned down, but still maintains terror and gruesome content without being too nauseating. There is also some disturbing scenes of sexual content mixed with violence which is deeply unsettling. This is not a film for the sensitive viewers. Don't watch if you have a weak stomach or dislike a black comedy horror picture."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","7","0","0","27 January 2017"," The queerest 'horror' movie I've ever seen.
","**Extra Spoiler Warning** <br/><br/>It's hard to describe American Psycho exactly... it's just as psychotic as the main character Patrick Bateman would have you believe. This film is an 80s nostalgia piece, a comedy-horror, a psychological film and the film that shot Christian Bale into Hollywood stardom pre-Batman Begins era. Bale's performance is great in this thing; he's a knockout, but it's unfortunate that the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Then again, maybe that's the whole point of the story.<br/><br/>Adapting a book is hard. I never read the book American Psycho, but I can tell that a lot of the satirical nature of the book would have been incredibly difficult to capture on film. It does a nice satire of American capitalist life and we can sort of see why Bateman turns out the way he is. The thing that really sells this movie is Bale's performance as Bateman, which I think is probably one of the best performances in the last quarter-century of cinema. The story though? It's implied that it's all COMPLETELY in his head.<br/><br/>I thought it was fun, but it was quite easily the weirdest film I've ever seen. I've seen quirky films before like Bran Nue Dae and Rock & Rule, and those films had simpler concepts to explore. American Psycho on the other hand is a story about a man trying to find his 'super-ego' in a world that he's grown sick and tired of. He f###s girls to Phil Collins music, kills a colleague while listening to Huey Lewis and The News' Hip to be Square; and he kills one of his female colleagues by DROPPING AN ACTIVE CHAINSAW down a staircase.<br/><br/>If you want a film that is oddly colourful yet has the gruesomeness of slasher films, have characters look like they were ripped out of Dr Seuss stories whilst seeing its main character on killing sprees played to pop-music of the 80s, then this is the movie for you. <br/><br/>Also, it is unusually funny, like humorous funny. I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>This is probably what smoking LSD feels like for a serial killer."

","Overall: This movie is an amazing movie and I would highly recommend you watch it.<br/><br/>Good: Incredible cinematography and music. Bale played his part to perfection and is truly a career highlight for him. To some odd degree, you root for him. He is not a good person but with the restraint he shows it displays a little bit of human inside of him giving more depth to him that people usually give him credit for. Honestly, I feel Bale should have won an Oscar for his performance but that may just be me. The plot is so simple yet also enthralling and gripping. It delivers so many conflicting ideas; you want the cops you catch him yet you also want him to escape. The ending is also great although a tad bit confusing. You learn something new with every watch.<br/><br/>Bad: I know their job is to support Bale but the characters surrounding Bale aren't interesting and just feel useless and their acting is sub- par. The more slow and boring parts, such as the drugs, can drag and feel like a time waster. Not to say I hated them all, I enjoyed the meeting with the pointles private detective and the humorous exchange of business cards. <br/><br/>Best Part: When Bale kills Jared Leto<br/><br/>MVP: Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman<br/><br/>9/10"

Despite the fact that Harron was a relatively new director, the film had no shortcomings in flawlessly adapting the novel. The rating of the movie is R due to the sex scenes, profanity, and gore. The movie offers you an invitation into the mind of a psychopath while displaying the comedy of it all. <br/><br/>Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, is the main character and focus of the film. He's a successful investment banker that leads a double life as a serial killer. With Bateman often expressing psychopathic desires, the core of the film's plot deals with his thoughts through narration. This element gives the impression that the viewer is hearing the thoughts of Bateman, which makes the build up of the movie suspenseful. The victims of Bateman include both people he's acquainted with and strangers. Throughout the film Bateman displays different personalities: a corporate nerd, a witty and materialistic asshole, and an insane serial killer. The personalities previously mentioned eventually intertwine by the end of the film. There's an element that plays with psychology when Bateman frequently slips in and out of reality; it adds another genre to the mix of the juxtaposed film.<br/><br/>Although the movie is focused around a psychotic man, there's still an element of underlying comedy. The dialogue and Bateman's personality is what adds that comedy. Bateman's outburst of vulgar, violent words towards other characters throughout the film is hilariously creepy because the other character doesn't hear him. He yells things such as, ""I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood,"" yet the bartender, the receiver of the quote, continues on normally. There's an axe scene where the killing is interluded by a history lesson of the song, ""Hip to be Square"", as Bateman dances around his victim, and later proceeds to bash his head in. At one point in the movie Bateman and his peers compare business cards as if it were a football game. These stated instances is what exemplifies the ridiculousness of Bateman. I am a huge fan of black comedy so I found it hilarious rather than completely morbid, and Harron's writing makes it easier to do so. <br/><br/>The movie deals with a lot of ""inside the mind"" narration, which adds the element of suspense to further shape it into a thriller. As a viewer, I was on the edge of my seat to see how the next killing would occur because his thoughts foreshadowed his urge to kill. The cinematographer did a good job with adding suspense because some of the shots during the night scenes resembled that of a film noir. Pairing the film noir shots with suspenseful film music as Bateman scrambled to hide evidence after a killing made me ask myself, ""Is he going to get away with it?"" The suspense factor makes the thriller more interesting and engaging. <br/><br/>American Psycho is a classic film. It's a classic notably because the scene with the axe has become iconic in popular culture, but also because of the remarkable delivery. The film utilized dark comedy and suspense to its advantage. If I had to give it a rating out of 5 stars, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5. It's a film that I continuously mention and recommend to those who have never seen it before."

","American Psycho is one of my favourite films of all time. It is such a great film with a cult following, but why does it not get more critical acclaim?

Gladiator, like really? 30 years down the road, it will be films like American Psycho that will be more fondly remembered.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes this film so great is the atmosphere. The overall atmosphere has an at-times-surreal, 80s feel that I have yet to witness in any other film.<br/><br/>The acting performances of Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe are as good as they get.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound effect/editing does not get sufficient credit. Of course, we also get to enjoy Patrick Bateman's favourite 80s music along the way.<br/><br/>Notice how I have deliberately not mentioned about the plot?

","An adaptation of a novel of the same name, American Psycho stars an excellent Christian Bale as the strutting, Narcissistic corporate high-flyer Patrick Bateman (a nod to Norman Bates?), in a mind-numbingly artificial and greed-obsessed mid 80's. His colleagues and acquaintances (and, indeed, Patrick himself, as he admits in the beginning) are completely hollow, devoid of any emotion and concerned only with prestige enhancing finery like business cards and restaurant reservations. The film oozes eighties cool: the suits, the hair, the music, the clubs, the apartments, the dresses, the dinners and of course the money. Harron and Guinevere Turner's script is crisp, frightening and funny. Although the film is Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) brutal, they skilfully reared it in compared to the source material. The script's quality pulls you in so many conflicting directions: are we supposed to laugh or hide behind our popcorn? Is this happening or not? And the odd feeling of do we want Patrick to get caught or not? <br/><br/>""American Psycho"" gets pretty much everything right: music by John Cale will have you singing the pop songs days later; duel visuals by cinematographer Andrzej Sekula shows grim New York streets of the homeless, against the decadence of Wall Street, which keeps in harmony with the film's conflicting theme; Isis Mussenden's costume design is detail perfect, rather than hamming it up with Dallas-like shoulder pads, Mussenden clothes the cast with sophistication and taste; and let's not forget a career launching performance from the always great Bale as Patrick: that glazed stare, privileged accent, creaseless shirt and flawless physique says more about the character than hours of exposition ever could. Bale's performance is outstanding. He shows all the characteristics of a serial killer (obsessive neatness, ridiculous over-articulation and a pedantic hyper-analysis of everything from business cards to Phil Collins albums) but in an incredibly subtle and underplayed way, as befits someone who is trying to keep this in check. The supporting cast is also spectacular; Jared Leto plays an arrogant, ultimately doomed colleague, Chloe Sevigny is Bateman's shy secretary and the only one person who seems to 'get' him. Reese Witherspoon makes brief but brilliant appearances as his fiancé. Bateman's murder sprees are much more amusing than they are disturbing (watch out for him running around naked wielding a chainsaw) and provide a few good laughs, as does his obsession with looking good. Any movie that can have the killer taking time to exfoliate and make it work is a winner in my book! The story is highly original; I won't deny that I was completely lost in the last 5 minutes of the film but it's so entertaining I didn't even mind. This is a top quality film made even better by superb acting and directing.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

","It would be a mistake for anyone viewing this film to search for meaning, when the story, the characters, and the culture within are utterly worthless. Any purpose they think they might have, or any significance they place on their meager actions are masked by a cloud of indifference so large that all there really is but the very delusion of the yuppie culture that further perpetrated such shallowness. It is from this nothingness that American Psycho can actually acquire meaning in its overall analysis of a capitalistic culture, which is enabled by soulless snobs that model themselves after Donald Trump. American Psycho is adapted from the novel of the same name by Brett Easton Ellis, who got a lot of flak upon the release back in 1991 for its portrayal of violence towards women, along with its misogynistic protagonist Patrick Bateman. It's not a pretty film to watch given its gruesome form of violence. But it can be amusing in its own sadistic fashion, as Christian Bale and other talented actors all depict a culture so sexist, and so indifferent to their materialistic gains that the only thing a viewer can do while watching is laugh at how disgusting the world of American Psycho is, and what it says about how American culture itself has become so soulless and boring to the point where it seems like we've been butchering each other for decades on and on. The setting is during the 1980's, and the story is mostly focused on the life of Yuppie, Patrick Bateman (Bale), who through his calm and subtle narrations, enlightens us viewers with his story and the very details he takes into account. Patrick gives us his address, workout regimen, taste for well-tailored suits, fine dining, and even his newly developed desire for murder. Patrick's contemplation of his craving at times can be at a blur, given that he does not fully understand his newly developed lust. And even the pattern in which he selects his victims can be at times random. It's hard to tell who he is particularly aiming at, or if he is trying to aim at that matter, given that most of his murders are executed with brutal and monstrous violence, but with poor ambiguity. Whether Patrick cuts off his associate's head clean off, or drops a chainsaw over a girl's back, one thing for sure is that he never gets caught. Strange to imagine, but most of Bateman's murders often go unpunished, or unnoticed, no matter how much he utters such confessions as, ""I like to dissect girls"", or ""Did you know I'm utterly insane?""<br/><br/>Be it drugs, alcohol, or meaningless materialism, Bateman and his colleagues are the purest representations of 1980's yuppies, as they frequent nightclubs, carry mistresses, and utter their own misogyny as though they were the remarks of poets than that of pigs. The only thing that separates Bateman from this cloth of snobs more is his desire for carnage as he repeatedly narrates about his confusion to this newly developed craving, thus illustrating a darker and more horrifying critique of this capitalist culture. Patrick Bateman is funny, being mostly cynical and overly chauvinistic to the point where he himself is a joke of an indifferent and materialistic era in American culture. His desire for money, fine clothing, physical perfection, and even his drug cravings represent the more typical representations of an American yuppie. But his violent appetite for murder and rape lead his mind to slip into more nihilistic territory, as he describes himself as , ""I am simply not there"", while equally lamenting over his victims demises. It's hard to determine whether or not these murders are actually committed, considering how Patrick is able to get away with them perfectly, and yet hardly ever bringing any effort into covering them up. This term ""normal"" is something that completely alludes a character such as Patrick Bateman. He does all he can to appear normal and to ""fit in"", as he stresses it and he even indulges in the same stupidities as his colleagues. And yet, he is far from the average human. Yes, he has flesh, blood, skin, and hair, but he claims that his emotions are not identifiable to other people, and even though he has small traces of those emotions whenever he tries to connect with his Secretary Jean (Sevigny), who has a crush on him, and in Patrick's eyes is the only person he can't bring himself to hurt, despite his attempts. Maybe Patrick's violent sadism is focused on the yuppies who mindlessly live with their drug use and their lavish spending, or maybe his new appetite is the signification that he has reached a higher state of being, thus surpassing the materialistic means of the culture of which he has dwelled in and very much become a victim of for too long. It's never certain as to what brought out this sudden desire for mayhem in Patrick. But it is all he knows and wants from this point on, as he sees that the world is riddled with the sort of indifference that enrages and allows him to justify his sadistic desire to kill. American Psycho is a cult thriller, with its equal share of laughs, but that's only if you have a dark side of your own. In the big picture, it is a critique of capitalism, and the sort of indifference and apathy it cultivates and nurtures to the point where it becomes habit and routine for people like Bateman. But on a deeper level, I think it is reasonable to say that this criticism is also focused on Bateman's violent appetite, which is a result of this culture, and it is the next step as he has surpassed the indifference that materialism fosters, and embarked on journey that will probably not change or mean anything significant to the world, given that he sees it as nothing but an abyss of meaninglessness, with merely corpses to fill his lust."

","I would like to say a special thank you to John ""The Flick Pick"" Flickinger for introducing me to this film on his YouTube channel.<br/><br/>I had always seen some of the more famous scenes from the film on YouTube but had never actually watched the film in it's entirety until about two years ago when I bought the Blu-Ray (A bit reckless I know considering I'd never seen the film and automatically bought the Blu-Ray).<br/><br/>I was blown away. Blown away with Christian Bale's performance, who up until then I'd only seen in Nolan's Batman trilogy, which managed to be hilarious, narcissistic, sympathetic and absolutely terrifying in equal measure! The way it's shot is beautiful too, the long wide shots of Patrick's apartment, the night scenes in the back alleys, even the opening scene of Patrick's routine, just lit so well and his apartment is almost too white, in stark contrast to what his night time activities end up looking like.<br/><br/>It's so devilishly funny as well, with most of the humour provided by Bale.

","Christian Bale's performance as the deranged Wall Street serial killer Patrick Bateman is the elevating feature of this film. It is a performance of ultimate dedication and passion. Did this film have to be made? not really. Does it totally convey the hopeless and nihilistic themes of the book? not really. Fans of the book will be disappointed by the condensing of a 300 page novel into a one and a half hour film. However, the scenes that are not cut are executed with suitable panache and style, credit to Director Mary Harron. Much of the violence is toned down, and tastefully done, with a cool, sterile colour palette and smooth camera-work juxtaposing the terrible acts committed on screen. It also is executed in a way that brings a dark comedic undertone to this cult classic. This film intrigued me enough to go and read the book. Before I read the novel, I thought the film was amazing. In retrospect, it pales in comparison to the original. However, as a stand alone piece of filmmaking, it is utterly unique and noteworthy. I highly recommend it. Watch if you loved 'Fight Club', which shares many themes but examines them in a different manner, or the TV show 'Mr Robot (Which is heavily inspired by both novels/films)"

","If you ever coveted a copy of ""Dress for Success"" as your personal Bible or were captivated by a critical analysis of Whitney Houston or Huey Lewis's artistic efforts, this is a definitive moment captured on celluloid.<br/><br/>Christian Bale of ""Little Women"" fame ascends a slight departure from the loving, kind, gentle soul but retains that ""I Want to Fit In!"" at any cost mentality in this role. I hailed all those many stereotypes, defiled in every scene and found the character hilarious.<br/><br/>Yes, he felt trapped and subjected to lower life forms while comparing watermarks on business cards and the ability to obtain the rare reservation at the latest Phenom restaurant. Who wouldn't lose their mind in this shallow, chasing shadows, meaningless existence? Here, we have an exceptionally sensitive and caring soul who just cannot bear one more moment of the herd mentality and cracks under pressure.<br/><br/>This was a divine commercial for Men's beauty products and regimen to achieve the look of perfection and charm. Such an erudite perspective of a clandestine approach to coping in the material world. Albeit, an unusual take that leaves one gasping for air, but perhaps for naught.<br/><br/>An additional viewing to appropriately review this title is required, but taking chances never did anyone much harm hence, this effort. I found the direction remarkable and parlayed many layers of complexity beyond shallow characters. The color schemes, pacing, scene caressing and framing compiled the true stars of this show.<br/><br/>High recommend for Christian fans, he is absolutely gorgeous, stunning, beautiful and full of promise.

","Mary Herron energizes Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel with an intelligent script and powerful direction in this violent, thought-provoking black comedy that will leave audiences shocked to the core. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a wealthy Wall Street investor living in the luxury apartments of New York City. During the day, Bateman is hard-working employee at the Wall Street industry with a loving fiancée Eveyln Williams (played by Reese Witherspoon), but is secretly in love with another blondie named Jean (played by Chloe Sevigny). When his friends and co-workers do not is that Bateman is hiding a dark and fatal secret when, at night, he lives with a life as a sadistic serial killer; murdering his fellow mates one by one. As his vicious body count steadily rises, he soon becomes increasingly insane and finds himself questioning reality and those around him. Actor Jared Leto makes a fantastic appearance as one of Bateman's close friends, and William Dafoe plays a New York detective who is assigned the case of the murders that rise from Patrick Bateman's hostility. <br/><br/>This is not your average serial killer flick. Instead of doing what most slasher-horror films do, centering on victims being slaughtered by one by one by a vicious psychopath, this revolves around the serial killer himself and how it murdering affects him psychologically. However, this film is not a horror film. Instead, it is a dark comedy that uses philosophical elements and some horror elements to create a chilling, thought-provoking story, and a captivating, but harrowing main character. Christian Bale takes on a risky role as the main character Patrick Bateman, a serial killer who sports a similar characteristic of Norman Bates from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. This vicious mentality is demonstrated in the scenes where he invites a friend over to his luxurious apartment, and treats them to classic 80s pops songs by artists like Phil Collins, Huey, Lewis, and Whitney Houston and gives them a smart talk about the before ending their life in a gruesome manner. In other scenes, and his dialogue in these scenes help portray the character's cruel sense of humor. Christian Bale is just fearless in this role, and his performance is stunning, probably one of the best performances he has given in his career. My only flaw with the film is the twist ending which is supposed to shock audiences, but only ends being more confusing than it needs to be.<br/><br/>American Psycho is a pretty captivating film, and a worthy adaption of Bret Easton Ellis's novel. It is very spine-chilling, very funny, and quite thought-provoking. I only recommend this movie to viewers 17 and over due to the graphic violence and sexuality that is present throughout."

","No one knows if all the things that Patrick Bateman does in American Psycho are actually happening or are all in his mind. The Director, Mary Harron says Patrick actually kills Paul, the prostitutes, the homeless man, and countless others in real life. But to look at this movie as just a white collar businessman-psychopath that kills people would be wrong. As you watch the movie you notice the reoccurring theme that no one seems to remember Patrick's name or even listen to him. Even his own fiancé doesn't listen to him. He tells people that he is mentally insane and after a girl asks him what his job is he tells her that he mostly works in ""murders and executions"" she mishears what he said and thinks she heard ""mergers and acquisitions"" Then, after the grand finale of the film where Patrick goes on a killing spree. He confesses to a co-worker, Harold that he is a serial killer and killed Paul Allen (another co-worker). But he just laughs and thinks of it as a joke and tells Patrick that he had lunch in London with Paul the other day. This shows that either Patrick is only committing the murders in his head or Harold forgot the person he had lunch with's real name and thought he was Paul Allen. What makes this movie great is the black comedy and social satire. The fact that Patrick openly admits to murdering people all the time is quite disturbing and hilarious. It also shows how self absorbed the people are in this portrait of the late 80s. They seem to only care about themselves and forget names and people. Patrick lives in an expensive penthouse and only cares about his looks showing the exaggerated materialism and shallowness of the time period. I hope that in the future, none of this comes true. We need to learn to listen to people because, for all we know, your friend could turn out to be the next Patrick Bateman."

Christian Bale takes off the facial masque at the beginning of the film and what follows is utterly disturbing and gruesome.<br/><br/>The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Bret Easton Ellis and it is set in the 1980s. The primary theme of the storyline is to underline in an exaggerated way how some people belonging to the elite upper class of society get driven by greed, lust for power, materialism and uncontrolled ambition to the point where they almost lose their humanity completely. In order to justify and validate the impression that they want others to have of them and they have of themselves, they go to absolutely disturbing lengths and violate other people. But all this wouldn't have worked had the film not been a great character study and had the film not involved a fascinating performance by Christian Bale playing the role of Patrick Bateman. We see that Bateman is not only trying to hide his true self from others but also from his own self. Thus in order to convince himself that he is better than others and not inferior in any way and also to hide his true nature from himself, Bateman treats others in the most disturbing manner possible.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt, one of the best performances in Christian Bale's career. He manages to expertly portray both sides of the character of Bateman. He is on one hand extremely suave and debonair looking, but on the other hand also manages to bring the requisite amount of violence and ruthlessness in his performances. His facial expressions change very quickly and viciously all the time to accentuate the fact that his character is always pretending to be one thing or the other in front of everyone else. Some of his screams and gestures in the film will make the sensitive viewers have nightmares.<br/><br/>The film has a very dreamy look and feel about it in a noirish sense. The director Mary Harron manages to conjure black comedy in the midst of all the madness for which the adapted screenplay and original novel also have to be admired. She also manages to end the film in a very artistically ambiguous manner. She asks the viewer to make his/her mind up about what really happened and leaves the door open for multiple interpretations. <br/><br/>American Psycho is a socially relevant film as well as a disturbing character study. The direction is very good and the central performance is fascinating. This is the kind of film that continues to linger in your thoughts after it ends and is extremely conducive for retrospective analysis."

","Everybody's a little Psycho.<br/><br/>It's great movie and it couldn't have been better than it is. Christian Bale portrayed Bateman beautifully. The film told more then it actually showed, it kinda implied most of what you see. And you can easily see how brutal Bateman is, without the director showing the murders. The cast is great and Christan is the only stand-out in my opinion.<br/><br/>I was not sure if I should give it a 8, but it's not good enough, then 7, It's not that bad. I decided to go with 7 cause I could not see it be with those masterpieces that i give 8,9 or 10.<br/><br/>We get to know Patric really well in the beginning of the film(like we got to know Jordan Belfort in the beginning of The Wold Of Wall Street), he's a man who takes care of him self dose not care about other, his needs are always a priority. I want to see other film do that instead of doing unnecessary scenes just to learn a character likes this kind of flower.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good movie there's nothing really special but there were memorable moments in it that all movie buffs should know. It's not a have to see, but i recommend this film to anyone who likes (moderate) bloody films."

","'American Psycho' directed by Mary Harron is, in one word, gorgeous, a perfect combination of insanity, comedy and brutality.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) has an alternate psychopathic ego that he hides from everyone, and through the movie he dives even deeper into his insanities.<br/><br/>The movie is great on a lot of aspects: The acting, the soundtrack, the screenplay...

","American Psycho. <br/><br/>A brilliant movie, to say the least. Any more gore and/or female degradation and this movie wouldn't be as accepted and quoted as it is (at least in my head). Didn't do well in the box office, nor does it get as much recognition as one of Christian Bale's stellar - early performances.<br/><br/>The movie has a very serious and dark tone to it, yet it has humour and eerie dialogue at some points. I can honestly say this movie never lets me down when I watch it - which I have easily done over 100 times in the past 15 years.<br/><br/>The book is very well written - repetitive, like Bateman is in the film, but good. Much more graphic and grotesque than the movie by a long shot. <br/><br/>..is that a gram?"
"liam_ragan","8","0","0","7 February 2015"," Beautiful psychopathy
","From the opening scene to the closing credits my phone stayed in my pocket and my eyes glued to the screen in complete concentration. Christian Bale takes on a Ted Bundy meets Wolf of Wall Street type character and is immediately engulfed in a world where monotonous lawyering is tolerated by day, and an insatiable blood lust embraced by night.<br/><br/>As the viewer gets acquainted to Patrick Bateman it is immediately obvious that he is nothing like anyone we've seen before. His treatment of anyone he views as inferior is psychopathicly condescending, and his reverence for his body borders on maniacal. Add to that that he's a rampant womanizer and you end up with a protagonist you love to hate and hate to see succeed.<br/><br/>It says something about the movie that every one of the upper class people in it is so concerned with masking their flaws that it's all we can see. In contrast, the ones who make minimum wage are humble of there defects and allow us to see a full rounded person instead of just a sham.<br/><br/>The only fault I have with this film is its ambiguous ending. Judging by the number of similar remarks I've read, you may feel the same.<br/><br/>Overall, incredible movie, highly recommended to anyone willing to spend sleepless nights pondering the conclusion."

","One of my favourite films ever. I'm coming back to review this more out of respect than anything else as I really enjoyed this film. It's a crazed, cynical look inside the mind of a seemingly regular member of the City elite and shows just how depraved human beings can be if we strip back the societal construct. More importantly, it's actually really funny in a lot of parts as well and overall a lot of fun to watch. Christian Bale was born to play this role in my opinion. He 'is' American Psycho and does it so well. This and Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and you've got four of the films in my top ten. The dialogue is brilliant, it's shot incredibly well and although I have to admit to having never read the book (and in a way don't want to now for fear of changing the 'feel' of it) I can say that everyone should try this film. Sheer excellence."
"GregForstner","8","0","0","1 January 2015"," Sensational adaption of a scandal novel
","Enter fabulous Patrick Bateman, successful Wall Street broker and nowadays embodiment of evil not only for his job, which is held in rather low regard these days, but for the things he does at night. It takes an actor as brilliant as Christian Bale to deliver a believable impersonation of a handsome powerful womanizer who ruthlessly indulges his darkest desires. Of course, some may see this movie as problematic because the viewer is forced into the perspective of a psychopathic serial killer who is simply too shining, too smooth, too perfect to be caught for his heinous crimes. Bateman can hardly be someone you sympathize with but then you are made to feel his abysmal desperation and his escapist fantasies. The horrendous ambiguity of the main character may be the overarching theme of this movie – in the end, we are left to guess whether the atrocious acts of violence took place in reality or merely in the mind of a seriously deranged personality. <br/><br/>There are two main interpretations for the riddle this movie constitutes: 1. In the first interpretation, Bateman really is the incarnation of Norman Bates and yes, he has pornographic sex with prostitutes before he slaughters them. Being probably slightly aware of the evil he is doing, he rarely lets go of a chance to confess to his crimes that reveal his true character. Remember the scene when he tells drunken Paul Allen in this Mexican restaurant that he likes to dissect women and that he was ""utterly insane""? But as so often, his fellow human beings ignore his confessions; it is as though they were unable to face the truth. They rely on their fixed image that they have of Bateman as an attractive successful CEO who can buy anything he wants. The power he has makes him intangible for the authorities. Then there is also room for the interpretation that they confuse the identities of one another because some of them have exactly the same job and they look very much alike. This hands Bateman a perfect alibi for his murder of Paul Allen and so Bateman even escapes the tricky interrogations with the private detective, played by Willem Dafoe. In a metaphorical reading, Wall Street is turned into a hotbed of moral corruption in which only surfaces and material values matter. A man as intelligent as Bateman has no difficulties at maintaining the false image he stands for but what is more horrifying is that no one cares who he really is. There are no borders set for him, neither by the law nor by common conventions. In this reading we can see Bret Easton Ellis's intention of crafting a jarring satire on the condition of American society in the 1980s, which is marked off by its superlative dark humor. 2. In the second interpretation, Bateman is a serial killer in his mind only. The terrible aggressions that he seems to harbor are unleashed in his bloody visions which are growing more and more intense. Possibly owing to high medications and a psychosis, Bateman thinks he really does the things he only dreams of or envisions. Thus, in the somewhat weird ending he is utterly desperate and close to madness when he learns that his lawyer ate dinner with a colleague he believes to have murdered long ago. I think the direction of Mary Harron suggests that the second interpretation is more likely. Take for example the scene before the ending when Bateman's secretary spies on his notebook and discovers all the gory drawings of his, thereby also seeing the real character of Bateman behind the surface. <br/><br/>Being what it is, ""American Psycho"" is one of the most misunderstood movies of film history. This is not a slasher flick that puts a lot of gratuitous violence on display. But it still has elements of a horror movie in it. It is not so much meant to shock than to make the audience think about what they've just seen. It's a dark satire that works seemingly adverse elements of various genres into a whole and it is a testimony to the greatness of Christian Bale, who renders the range of all possible emotions visible and manages one of the most controversial figures of modern cinema."

","American Psycho is a unique movie, since it can not be fully explained and understood. Christian Bale is just awesome in this movie as he keeps a cool head for the most of the movie and the his commenting on music is just hilarious. The movie really shows what a person can become when they have it all, Patrick Bateman had it all, a well-paid job, an expensive apartment, a good looking girl, all the drugs he wanted, which eventually led him to being insane, in his insanity he thought he was killing people, that can be understood from the parts where he walks around the town and blows up police cars and still gets completely unnoticed, the incident with a cat just tops it and viewers can sort of understand that none of the killings really took place, since Patrick had gone insane. This was not meant to be a slasher movie by any means, if anyone wants to see dozens of killings this is not really a movie to see then, this movie is more about understanding the story of a crazy psychopath, who has it all, but still is envious of every little thing, somebody else has,which leads to him killing everybody in his mind for his own amusement."
"bowmanblue","10","0","0","3 November 2014"," Bale's finest hour
","Yes, many enjoyed Christian Bale's (excellent) turn as Bruce Wayne in Nolan's Batman trilogy. However, there are few occasions where an actor shines so bright that it becomes impossible to see anyone else ever playing the role. In this case... yuppie, eighties serial killer 'Patrick Bateman.' 'American Psycho' started off life as a book (which I strongly recommend you read if you enjoyed the film) and sat around in filmic-limbo for years before it finally made its way to the big screen. The book was one of those titles where die-hard fans argued so hard that it was 'impossible' to make into a film that no studio dared go that extra mile and attempt it.<br/><br/>Now, the end result is certainly different to the book. The book had numerous complex points and sub-plots which would have stretched the film out for hours. However, just because the film skips vast areas, doesn't mean it doesn't hit the nail on the head. What you're left with is a 'summarised' version of the film (and a very good one).<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is the titular 'American Psycho' who works on Wall Street in the eighties and leads a double life as a high-flying businessman and a complete nut-job who, by his own admission like to 'dissect women.' And he does just that.<br/><br/>Feminists have given many labels to this film which indicate that it's misogynistic and demeaning to women. They may have a point here and there. Bateman (along with his cronies) regularly objectify women and are basically only after one thing (two in Bateman's case, as he also likes to murder his dates). However, we're never shown that this is some sort of example for men to adhere to. We only tolerate Bateman's madness because he entertains us. The only thing that equals his brutality is his charm (as, apparently, is a trait of many a convicted killer/psychopath) and he, like Bale who performs him, is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>There isn't as much gore as you may expect (certainly the book is a million times more graphic) and much of the violence is left up to the viewers' imagination (what did he do with that coat hanger after all?), so gore-hounds beware – if you're just looking for the 'red stuff,' you may be left feeling short-changed.<br/><br/>Fan of Bale will probably already have seen it. It's certainly a vehicle for him to keep on his C.V. It never claims to be nice and you're going to have to be into 'serial killer' type movies to get something out of it. Just – whatever you do – don't watch the sequel (or feed me a stray cat)."

I think Christian Bale, was fantastic, and perfect as a Psycho.<br/><br/>The film is not just about the character Patrick Bateman, the psycho. It's also a mockery of the whole 80's Wall Street scene.<br/><br/>If you notice, pretty much everyone in his office looks and acts exactly the same. They are all white guys with brown hair, glasses, suits; they even have the same business card, although they brag about the differences.<br/><br/>They are so much alike that nobody knows who anyone else is. Paul Allen always confused Patrick Bateman with Marcus Halberstrand. Then Bateman's own lawyer calls him ""Davis.""

Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, the quintessential hollow man, gives one of the most amazing performances in the history of movies. Why he didn't win an Oscar, I'll never know. He makes Patrick Bateman as memorable and tortured a monster as Norma Desmond in 'Sunset Boulevard.' Patrick is the 27-year-old CEO of a company whose obsession with status has turned him psychotic. He is a sociopath who embodies the meaning of the term 'cutthroat' by literally hacking the competition to death.

Neither too artsy or too commercial, just a perfect balance between a blockbuster horror and a tragic drama. This equilibrium paves the way for Christian Bale to deliver a great performance which is, in my opinion, the prime of his career, both commercially and artistically. His performance is very professional yet passionate, like he was completely absorbed into the character's infatuation for mass murder. Bale makes a connection with the audience with his charm and neatness, while his eyes make the character's schizophrenia almost tangible."

","Christian Bale is one of my most favorite actors and I've always enjoyed his performances. This is one of his earlier movies that really stood out and showcased his amazing talent. I had a tough time finding this movie on DVD. I looked high and low for almost a year, and when I finally got my hands on it, I was really excited and relieved. After watching this movie, all I can say is the long wait was absolutely more than worth it. Christian Bale's performance in this movie reminded me of two of his other movies, Equilibrium and The Machinist. In American Psycho, Patrick's character can be really cold and emotionless at times, which is very similar to the main protagonist in Equilibrium. Christian Bale can really put on an emotionless face. And similarly to The Machinist, Christian Bale truly embraced Patrick's character and embodied the character. His performance in this movie was so convincing and powerful that I will never forget it. Christian Bale once again demonstrates his dedication and commitment to make the movie a success. Judging from his amazing physique and great body shape, he must have did rigorous and extensive training. While for The Machinist, he did the exact opposite, losing crazy amounts of weight and having the body of a chopstick. I really respect Christian Bale's professionalism as an actor. Coming back to this movie, I think it's smart, hilarious, bloody and thought provoking. The ending really got me guessing whether all of it was real or merely just a fantasy. This movie really sparked my imagination, and there's so many ways I can interpret it. I strongly suggest everyone to go watch it and interpret it for yourself, because this movie is a true gem."

","*contains spoilers*<br/><br/>It's almost like we watch Patrick Bateman go from his normal life. We see a mounting anxiety in him of being mistaken for other people, of killing people and not getting caught, like the real estate agent. And we get to the scene where he's crying on the phone and confessing to his lawyer what he did, and then his lawyer doesn't even really know who he is. The idea being that he gets so hysterical he's just straight up begging somebody to listen to him confessing to all these crimes, and there's still no reaction, and it's almost like he gives up. And he's right back where he started; he' sitting in the same bar with the same stupid friends talking about what they're going to eat and what they're going to drink, and it's just like, this guy is out there, and there's lots of other guys like him. It's almost like alienation breeds serial killers, everyone's so disconnected, it really doesn't matter, it doesn't matter who you kill, it doesn't matter what you do. We're all just robots.

Of course, my opinion has since changed, and it is actually one of my all-time favorites. What I didn't realize from my first viewing of this film is that American Psycho isn't really a ""drama"" or a ""horror-thriller"". It's actually a dark comedy, and an insanely quotable one at that! <br/><br/>After multiple viewings, the movie actually felt very light-hearted in a strange, twisted way. It's intention was to be over the top and poke fun at the upper-class. Christian Bale's performance initially left me feeling sick to my stomach, but that is only proof of the man's talent. The character of Patrick Bateman doesn't kill people because he has to, he kills people because he enjoys it. Christian Bale made me believe he enjoyed his murder spree. I'd hate to know how he prepared for this role! <br/><br/>Bale's co-stars do a great job too, with solid performances from a few well known actors (Reece Witherspoon, Jered Leto, and William Defoe), and many lesser known actors. The entire cast and crew did a great job of bringing the audience into a world where greed and selfishness is the forefront of this familiar society. The world that director Marry Harron created is merely a parodied reflection of our own society. We live in a time when people are more concerned with their own public-image than the well-being of others. American Psycho found a way to make us laugh about it."

","American Psycho is not the film you expect it to be when judging it by it's cover. It's one psychologically jarring experience, a study of one man's struggle who must conform to fit in, and even then he doesn't get respect. Patrick Bateman is the psychologically disturbed, and successful executive who's mind has slowly tipped, into carrying cruel acts of murder on numerous people, strangers, workmates, etc. Though we are to question, whether it's fantasy or reality, the corrupt and sick thoughts, violently imagined images of an unbalanced mind. This is Bale's movie, 'his trying to keep his mind together, and not slipping into murderous urges moments', scary and totally believable, despite all the other good performances, from a great assemblage of actors. They fit the roles completely, although Witherspoon as Bale's fiancée, got on my nerves, overacting the s..t out of her, almost mirroring her real self, off screen I guess. I almost wanted to take an axe to her. Although we identity with Bale's character, and feel a smidgen sorry for him, we detest him, especially with me, being a dog lover. AP has class, and is entertaining as from the interaction of characters, but also on the grounds of being different. Yes... and it's bloody, the Jared Leto scene, with him being chopped up by axe at the murderous hand of Bateman, the standout one. It has humour, too, thanks to some of it's female cast, who really deliver (Sevingy and Mathias). In the end, AP, will have you pondering as to the fantasy and reality element of the film. The gaunt Dafoe adds spark, as a detective, probably, slightly envious of Bateman, who's investigating the disappearance of one of Bateman's colleague. I must say it before finishing tis review- Leto is one of the most impressive actors I've ever seen it for my life. I've heard the book's better, but honestly I wouldn't touch it with a nine foot pole. And if you're smart, you'd leave AP 2 where it belongs- on the video shelf."

"tricemooreth","Null","0","0","4 October 2013"," Original Theme, Grasping Movie
","In almost all films, there is symbolism, which allows a fictional story to explain a realistic theme. Using symbolism, a director can relay the message of the film without boring the audience. Mary Harron, uses ""American Psycho"" to show her feelings about self-indulgent businessman. Although this movie is based off a book, she certainly includes biased opinions that don't always agree with the book. Whether it is similar to the book or not, this movie has clearly been one of the more successful movies of the 21st century because of its great impact. ""American Psycho"" is a wonderful film because it uses a thrilling, satirical story to show the effects that greed, pride, and material gain have on men of wealth and power. ""American Psycho"" uses not only the character of Patrick Bateman, but also his co-workers and friends, to show the vanity of a middle-aged American businessman. They are focused entirely on their appearance and the smallest of things that represent their wealth. This is clearly shown in the scene where they are examining each other's business cards. The scene is intense, suspenseful, and overdramatic as each slowly pulls out their little white cards. It even gets to the point where Patrick Bateman breaks into a full sweat when his card is trumped by Paul Allen's card. The scene is captivating but also holds a strong theme, which makes it so powerful. ""American Psycho"" not only uses scenes like this to show that their narcissism forces them to dramatize little details, but it also uses scenes to show how they are oblivious to some of the biggest details of their lives. <br/><br/>After a violently murdering Paul Allen with an axe, Bateman drags the dead body in an overnight bag across the floor of the empty lobby, leaving a bloody track, and waves down a taxi outside. As he is throwing the bag into the back of the taxi, he is surprisingly confronted by Luis Carruthers, his flamboyant co-worker. Their short conversation is cut off when Luis stops and stares at the body bag that Bateman is loading in the trunk. Bateman's shear panic is relieved when Luis asks with awe, ""Where did you get that overnight bag?"" This satirical situation shows how Luis's greed completely blinds him from the fact that there is a psychotic serial killer right before his eyes. But this dull theme isn't presented in a dull way, instead it's presented in a gripping scene of suspense and with a dose of humor.<br/><br/>Audiences and critics might say ""American Psycho"" is lacking explaining of why Bateman is so psychotic or they might find it to be incredibly unrealistic. Some audiences might even find it to lack entertainment and instead just be gruesome and pointless. But to truly understand and enjoy this movie, one must have the attitude that the movie is satirical and symbolic of the everyday cocky businessman. Patrick Bateman's represents the personality of a self-fulfilling man who cares only for his own needs. The violence is intended partially to receive a humorous response as it merely represents this personality. One cannot take this movie at face value, but instead must understand the subtext of the scenes.<br/><br/>Connecting the idea of greed to the strong, grasping scenes in this movie is the key to its success. The audience is entertained but also receives a very informing theme: Some men are too focused on material gain that they are oblivious to many great details of their world and that some men have such selfish desire that they will do almost anything to fulfill their needs. Mary Harron does a magnificent job of creating impactful scenes that also create a plot. Ending the movie with an unanswered question of whether it is reality or fantasy allows the audience to see it more as a metaphor. ""American Psycho"" will always be questioned and criticized for its strange take on an ordinary situation, but it is no question that it will leave you thrilled and curious of the many people like Patrick Bateman."

It's comical how Patrick Bateman turns from big time CEO of his father's company to a strung-out psychopathic killer with no hope of being helped. The film also did an excellent job portraying the ridiculously superficial America of the time (and still mostly to this day). I highly recommend this film for everyone, man and child. Okay, maybe not children because there are quite a few murder scenes as well as sex scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie proved to be a great piece of cinema and I hope it's forever loved and appreciated by generations to come."

","American Psycho is a terrific movie with an extremely well developed storyline that is kept interesting and exciting all the way through and a really inspired performance from Christian Bale.I found it much more frightening to follow the psychopath rather than following a character who is going to be killed,it is much more frightening the go into the characters messed up mind and learn about the small and stupid things that make him want to kill people.Patrick Bateman is a great character,he was extremely unlikeable and it annoyed how he was getting away with all these murders,but thats how they wanted you to feel,and they did it very well.I would highly recommend American Psycho to all fans of thrillers and horror.<br/><br/>By day,slick banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) lives a life of excess and style,but by night,lets his murderous alter ego out to play."

","I had heard many words used to describe this movie, such as ""chilling"" and ""violent"" so I honestly was not expecting to be cracking up half the time but I WAS! And days later, I'm still chuckling. I'm highly anti-spoiler so I won't say more on that front but Christian Bale was brilliant. The nuance in his performance blew me away. It so easily could have gone cheesy but he hit it on the head. Perfect. Of course, it is a violent, bloody movie so, not for the squeamish. But that stuff really takes a backseat to the character study and the social commentary. Additionally they really nailed the setting/costumes/hair/makeup/etc. I had to remind myself that this was not actually filmed in the 80s. Well done."

Sure, its not a flawless film, but it still works largely, because the protagonist, Patrick Bateman, the psychopath, is an interesting character. His journey is full of blood & sadism, but he still appeals as a despicable leading man. Mary Harron's Direction is wild. Cinematography captures the violence as well as the madness, ably. Editing is good.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, the psychopath, is incredible. Bale has delivered amazing performances all through his impressive career, but his work in 'American Psycho' ranks amongst his finest. The Oscar-Winner is in complete form, yet again! In the supporting cast, Willem Dafoe & Jared Leto stand out.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'American Psycho' is uninhibited & brutal. You need a strong stomach to absorb this one!"

"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","13 June 2013"," Psychotic charisma
","A film everyone knows to at least exist. A film that is said to capture the ugly underbelly of modern society, of modern America. And, in a way, it does just that. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a horrible human being. He's man obsessed with style, fashion, appearances, pop culture, sex and looking good in front of the crowds, a flawed human being that we all want to be. We all want to be him because he's rich, successful, extremely good looking and sexually active. He's everything we are told to be and everything we want to be, in our darkest dreams.<br/><br/>This is a brutally honest film. It's very direct, very straight to the point and it has a clear message: modern society is obsessed and its obsession is not productive. This single point is supported by a clear vision from the director, an amazing acting talent from Bale and a story that has no wasted motions, no wasted scenes. It's all a single, flawless trip through a flawed wasteland that is a modern day utopia.<br/><br/>A lot has been written about the ending. Some say it's just perfect, some that it's hard to understand, some that it could have been better, some that it ruins the whole film and some that it's the single flaw in a perfect film. I tend to think that the whole film is about the aimlessness of modern day society, about the meaninglessness of living in a society this obsessed with appearances. So why shouldn't the ending be just as meaningless? Still, it's a pretty jarring ending that will alienate at least half of the viewers, which is never a good thing. It could have been better, in my opinion.<br/><br/>This is a fascinating film. It's brutal, it's stylistic, it's honest, it's confusing, it's slick, it's jarring, it's an experience worth having."

"krisrox","10","0","0","16 February 2013"," Superb adaptation of modern classic
","I've read ""American Psycho"" by Bret Easton Ellis three times, and consider it a modern classic. It's both a brilliant satire and a psychological thriller with David Lynchian ambiguous elements thrown in, and as such, it seemed destined to be butchered by Hollywood: satire and ambiguity don't sell, while the superficial elements that the book so hilariously portrays - gore and luxury - do.<br/><br/>Lucky for us, the adaptation was passed around by the big players, dropped a few times and finally scooped up by the semi-obscure Canadian director Mary Herron. Left with a relatively small budget, she decided to build her movie around Christian Bale, who - believe it or not - was also very much a struggling B- or C-lister in 1999.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it couldn't have worked out better. Free from the pressures of a big budget, Herron expertly translates the essence of the novel to the big screen without resorting to unwarranted commercial stylings. She allows the movie to define a genre of its own: ""American Psycho"" is equal parts black comedy, 80s homage, slasher movie, and thriller, brought to us by its very unreliable narrator, the infamous Patrick Bateman.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Christian Bale. I am by no means a member of the Christian Bale fan club, but his work here is fantastic and I cannot imagine another actor nailing Bateman this perfectly. No hyperbole needed: this is one of my 10 favorite movies of all time, with one of my 5 favorite lead actor performances of all time."

","The modern fictional serial killer Patrick Bateman might easily have said..."" They will look back with interest and say that I gave birth to the 21st century"". This, of course, is a bastardization of the well known quote from real-life psycho Jack the Ripper. It is pertinent here because it was a brilliant concept of Novelist Ellis that the real blood-letters and psychopaths were not the usually profiled, although Patrick Bateman does say ""I'm a child of divorce, give me a break"".<br/><br/>But that is a doubtful creation of the empty, soulless materialism and ""cremation of care"" mindset that befits and thus spawned these greedy Wall Street monsters. Witness the recent financial meltdown. If that isn't a reality based on the metaphor of the Novel and the Film, then you just don't get it. But the American people got it in the form of taxpayer bailouts, unemployment and a sluggish economy.<br/><br/>The Movie is an artsy, slick, sombre, but ""playful and mysterious dish"" of dark humor, insanity, and the instability of the insatiable yuppie in-crowd. For these American Dream killers there is so much detachment that even the names of people that work closely together are interchanged and forgotten. It is to this point that our modern manifestation of ""success"" loses his grasp on reality and fails to know who or what is going on.<br/><br/>The last third is purposely ambiguous and for that it has a necessary unsettling and unresolved feel. A sense that...even our President can be delusional while appearing to be in command...""A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.""

","Perhaps many would think I overestimated this movie, but for me its of my favorites (10). It's amazing how Mary Harron, manages the association between a typical American businessman high class, with a psychopath. The criminal does not necessarily looks bad, is what wants to tell us. The prejudices of the human mind deceive us. nobody would doubt that a sophisticated man could be a psychopath. I don't know if it happened to someone else, but I felt myself on Bateman's feet, not on victims. this also happens in Hitchcock's films. this film plays with more perverse and hidden mental instincts of human mind. I Celebrate the murder of Paul Allen, without going into moral considerations about what might cause insanity in Bateman.<br/><br/>I relaxed myself and simply enjoy this movie full of blood and madness. Caution: a psychopath not necessarily arises because of a conflictive life. Bateman had everything but at the same time he had nothing, he was a rich business man, from Harvard, with an expensive apartment, money, sophisticated taste for music and cooking, good looking, but he realized that he actually had nothing, and that life is fragile and worthless."

","Patrick Bateman is the epitome of what success really is or at least the idea propagated by the media of what this must be. Wealthy, amazingly good-looking, powerful, cultured enough to make valuable points about the artists he likes and he's engaged with a rich and beautiful woman. There's only one thing on his way to achieve perfection: he kills people. Maybe that's what makes him feel complete within himself. But then again what's he doing with his life? Is he really doing the things he thinks he's doing?<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" pulls plenty of tricks to convey its message on how thin the line between sanity and insanity really is, and there's so much to take into account that one does not fully understands the movie in just one view. It looks something simple to be solved but it's just the other way around. The more you see it the more you realize how shaky everything is, nothing and no one is reliable. <br/><br/>Speaking of reliable, Bateman (played by a flawless Christian Bale) isn't much of a trusty character, but not in the sense he fools people, pretending to be nice to later murder them. It's more that he's so over the top in some of his actions and reactions that he's completely unbelievable, specially when things start to turn upside down for him, he doesn't get credit for his acts. But is he really there? No one seems to be listening to what's he saying. How much of Bateman's murders are real or just imagination or maybe fantasies of his twisted persona? If they're real what's the pleasure in killing people? There's madness, hysteria, ecstasy, laughs whenever he's slaying and brutalizing his victims, frequently preceded of long opinions on the musicians he listens to. But there's no true enjoyment afterwards. We can't see that on his face or some sense of gain in getting rid of his victims, merely people of whom he just needs to make them disappear, such as a business acquaintance he truly dislikes (played by Jared Leto) or a poor homeless. If he feels something we'll never know, he hides deep down inside.<br/><br/>Bale is such a good actor for this part that comes as a shock to know that he wasn't the first choice for the role. Thankfully, many obstacles in the way of making it made it possible to him take this role which people said to him ""It will kill your career!"". It turns out to be not only one of his most notorious roles but also the one that reinvented him to Hollywood, a completely 180 degree turn up of his most recognizable role to that date as Jim in ""Empire of the Sun"". The character he plays here is vain, brutal, calculist, deeply impressed by the mass culture of the period he lives but completely apathetic and careless on the people of and out of his circle. He exteriorizes many expressions but down in the core we know he can't feel anything. That's why he does what he does (if he ever did). To make a relevant comparison, the performance of the actor and his character reminded of Eric Packer, played by Robert Pattinson in ""Cosmopolis"", one of the most debated films of the last years. Hard to reach a good consensus on it because his character resembles a lot Patrick Bateman but the performance of the actor leaves us confused, there's difference in the situations he lives and the one he faces through the whole journey. <br/><br/>Of all the film adaptations based on Bret Easton Ellis novels this is truly the greatest one. Mary Harron made a hard effort in making this looks like the 1980's (""The Informers"" is so poor in this aspect), quite a nostalgic time travel in between musics and references, a truthful portrayal of the yuppie generation as never shown before in so many details, yet it reveals so much about every vain and blind generations that came after in the 1990's and the 2000's. Perhaps that's the reason why people identifies with this movie so much, even after years of its release. Harron also got it right with the casting - Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Chlöe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Matt Ross, Guinevere Turner (who also wrote the script) all in positive performances. <br/><br/>Disturbingly funny, the movie and its main character are powerfully iconic just as Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"", both easily misinterpreted by a vast majority of its viewers. Bateman's tirades are priceless whether discussing Huey Lewis & The News musical qualities before killing one of his victims or his repeated line about having to return some videotapes. Like he says ""he's just a happy camper!"" 10/10"

","okay i am going to concede something first of all- i watched American psycho because Michael c.hall said in an interview that his inspiration for his dexter character( who i absolutely adore because of his different shades) was the character of Patrick Bateman. so my subconscious mind was rather busy finding similarities between the adept and somewhat moralistic serial killer dexter and erratic, lunatic and 'driven to the edge of emptiness by the greed and mechanic corporate world' serial killer Bateman. let's get to the core of Bateman because i think he is the only character worth analyzing in this movie. as the movie begins the rituals and emptiness of emotions of Bateman is for everyone to see by dint of bale's out of this world facial expressions. his amazing delivery of the dialog- 'i simply am not there.' goes to show his struggle to maintain a social life outside to hide the killer inside much like Dexter. but that's about as far as it goes with similarities between him and Dexter.<br/><br/>Dexter is born with blood lust but Bateman is driven to blood lust by the greed and expectation of being superior in lifestyle than others of the corporate and to an extent modern city life and the pressure it brings with it. the vice presidents of pierce and pierce, including Bateman, in spite of their achievements are simply not happy. they judge and envy each other based on designer clothes and 'tasteful' accessories. Bateman just has an extreme reaction to this envy or as he puts it- disgust. the disgust is rather disagreement on certain choices rather than actually being disgusting on a morale level. his victims earlier in the film are disgusting to him like- Paul or that homeless guy. as the film progresses his victims are victims of his impulse or insanity rather than disgust.<br/><br/>a scene which really catches me is when Bateman drags Paul's dead body in a bag. seeing him Luis asks him where he got that bag instead of asking what he was carrying in it. he was more interested in knowing the brand of the bag rather than inquiring bateman what it was that was so heavy that he had to drag in an overnight bag.this scene gives the feeling of corporate greed. the conversation in ESPACE solidifies this feeling of emotional emptiness, which is predominant throughout the film, through the sheer disbelief of bateman in what he himself was saying, evidenced by bale's brilliant empty eyes and facial expressions.<br/><br/>Bateman is not as calm as Dexter because he was not born a serial killer. in every conversation with the detective, his nervousness and suspicious behavior gives him away. his impulse ultimately drives him to insanity. his relation with his secretary is the only relationship in this movie that is interesting.i can't help but think that he feels something for her. when he brings her to his apartment he is hesitating and not as spontaneous as he is with his other kills. after Evelyn's call he asks her to leave before he hurts her. his panic call to her is as close as bateman comes to humanity in this film. the ending is confusing yet brilliantly sublime. my interpretation is that bateman didn't kill them, just wanted to. his assistant finds his Pb where his wishes are drawn out and you may call them fantasy. he might never have the guts to kill them in real life but he thinks his kills and fantasies will help him get rid of his 'greed and disgust'. this ending goes perfectly with the film's tone. finally, the movie and bale is brilliant.the sex scenes are disturbing the only fault you can find is you do not get to connect with any other character. that's why i think if you take bale out of this film you are left with absolutely nothing. bale deserved an Oscar. many found humor in this film but i honestly didn't find any. maybe because bale consumed me with horror and disbelief through his actions and pin point acting. if you watch this movie closely you will be encapsulated by bale and have your own view of the ending. that's what so brilliant about it."

It's well worth watching and you'll find yourself thinking about this moving for a day or two after you've watched it.<br/><br/>The ending however left me with a strange feeling. I'd expect this movie to go on for like 15 more minutes and give some explanation: did he really kill those people? What of what the spectator has seen is true and what's the main character's imagination? I went to IMDb to read reviews to clear this up since I thought maybe I've skipped or misunderstood something. But indeed, the author just doesn't give an answer and like some guys say, it's all the same if the character actually killed or just imagined killing. Well, this is OK but the ending is still too abrupt. If the author wanted us to think that there is no difference if he killed or not, he should have chewed on this for some more time in the ending. I mean it's OK if the film leaves me guessing, but in this case it's just too much guessing and guessing in a slightly wrong area (not the moral or conceptual things but just unexpectedly missing parts in the plot)."

","The story is an average one but what makes it worth watching is the character of Bale. The character has its own attraction. The story is about a big industrialist who lives mysteriously and is difficult to understand because of what he is doing or do at the next moment. This type of character makes you watch each and every scene with proper enthusiasm. It explores the behavior of a mentally unstable person very nicely. In the end there are some breathtaking scenes.

"Hawkensian","8","0","0","9 August 2012"," A funny, solid adaptation with a perfectly realised interpretation by Christian Bale.
","Christian Bale delivers a superbly realised interpretation of Patrick Bateman; his performance has already become iconic. The nuances of Bateman's voice, which has an air of arrogance and comical sincerity, are identified by Bale and expertly delivered; Bale's performance is one of my all time favourites. The truly original narrator, endlessly quotable script and brilliantly dark, idiosyncratic humour have created a large following; it's the proverbial cult film.<br/><br/>The film follows Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street executive in the prime of his life who is surrounded by equally affluent and aesthetic contemporaries. He is achingly vapid and appears not to have a sincere relationship with anyone, not even his 'supposed fiancé' Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon). In Bateman's world, everything is for surface value, even his job, which he continues with because he 'wants to fit in'. As the strain of his lifestyle begins to overwhelm him, Bateman begins to indulge in his violent urges.<br/><br/>The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 controversial novel of the same name. As anyone who has read 'American Psycho' will testify, there are passages that are simply unfilmable; the film was always going to be toned down in comparison. However, I feel the film has been neutered somewhat, I feel the film is lacking a visceral edge, it nails the satire, but it isn't quite dark enough. As the novel progresses, Patrick Bateman becomes increasingly psychotic and depraved, he descends into the depths of madness, and this isn't quite captured in the film. As sordid as it sounds, I do believe the film should have been crueller, darker; it should have put more emphasis on the depersonalisation and sadism of Bateman. There is one moment concerning an axe and a raincoat which is thoroughly entertaining and memorable, however it borders almost on slapstick, which it certainly didn't in the novel. The violence rightfully didn't enter exploitation cinema territory, I wouldn't wish for gratuity. But, then again, how do you define gratuitous? At what point does a film or book become gratuitous? These are questions that were at the forefront of my mind when reading the novel, and I think it's very hard to answer.<br/><br/>Despite this, it is a good adaptation; Harron and Turner's script is sharp and overall makes good use of its difficult source material. For instance, the film incorporates the book's music chapters to great comic effect; Bateman expressing his admiration and laughably deep analysis of Genesis, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and The News to prospective victims. Through these scenes the viewer witnesses the lengths of Bateman's vapidity.<br/><br/>It is a rather difficult film to wholly appreciate and absorb on initial viewing, which is good, because I feel 'American Psycho' has much replay value; I have revisited both the book and film countless times. Much like the novel, the film polarised audiences, and it doesn't surprise me. When viewing for the first time, one must appreciate Bret Easton Ellis used a large helping of hyperbole to convey his message of greed and superficiality, and also a good deal of surrealism. The film isn't entirely rooted in reality. The way in which Bateman's associates repeatedly forget each other's names and identities and how Bateman's actions become questionably implausible may confuse or deter the viewer. However, some would say that in our world of revolting socialites and vacuous celebrity and fashion culture, the extent of American Psycho's hyperbole is becoming increasingly dubious in places.<br/><br/>'American Psycho' is a peculiar creation. Many people get it and love it, however I'm sure many would be perplexed by it, maybe completely disappointed by it. I am biased, but I know that I am one of many people who fully appreciate 'American Psycho', part of a large group who will know what you mean when you say 'I have to return some videotapes'. Some won't like or appreciate it, and that's no detriment of the viewer's, but if you do, then I think you'll find yourself revisiting the film and picking up a copy of Ellis' compulsively readable novel. However, regardless of whether you like it, I can guarantee that you'll never hear Phil Collins' 'Sussudio' in the same way again.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"

I was aware of this movie for a while but avoided it because I thought the acting would be dry. However, I finally sat down to watch it and was blown away. Its strongest pillar is none other than Mr. Bale. Trust me; you've never seen him like this. His character is sadistic, redefines cruel and is a true sociopath, and yet you can't turn away.

Taking place during the 80s, one can't help but feel Bale's character was driven to this sick path due to some feeling of social isolation. The 80s here are depicted as an era of the ""fast times'. A growing gap between the rich and poor (reminiscent of Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street""), people's ever growing affinity with drugs and of course the music that was there but also wasn't. In his meticulous mind, he appears to be the only one who seems to actually be paying attention to what he's hearing. Strangely idealistic and yet without direction, it's one of the strangest characters you'll ever see on screen.<br/><br/>Bold, sickening and just exhilarating, check out ""American Psycho""."

","a clockwork orange, this whole experience just seems like a clockwork orange in a better camera view, but that's not a bad thing. What this has in common with A.C.O is its main character, they both have their own monologues, they both are into sex and violence, and they have good taste in music. I just wanted to get that out of the way, anyway back to the film I watched recently. Christian Bale, now I think of him as Batman, but i would never had suspected him to portray such madness and insanity, while keeping a cool calm persona. One of the greatest things about this film is Patrick Bateman, I feel that without him; or with a different person, that this film would be less likable and perhaps even boring. I find myself being more and more into the horror genre when I find more films like this to watch, that reminds me that I love the scene where Patrick is doing sit-ups while watching The Texas chainsaw massacre, it just shows that horror movies where the big hit of the 80's (Friday the 13th and Freddy Krueger) and as well that horror movies can play a small part in someones insanity.<br/><br/>My final thoughts: A simply great film, it is fun to watch this film, you could get some chills off Chistian Bale's performance as the psychotic killer: Patrick Bateman, and I recommend this to anyone who like clockwork orange, likes horror movies, and even if you can see the satire of the 80's in such a grizzly way."

","Of course, when watching the movie it is almost unavoidable that you compare it to Bret Easton Ellis's classic novel of the same name. Having been truly horrified by the disturbing yet entrancing mind of Bateman in the book, I watched the movie expecting incredible things. Somehow, in an intangible way, the movie just didn't sit well with me. <br/><br/>As an individual film, it can claim to be something of a flawed masterpiece, a dive into the deep end of the human psyche and the nature of morality. Add in a dash of the theme of empty materialism, and you have a movie that should not soon be forgotten. A memorable performance from Bale, as he flies between flamboyant charmer to dead eyed murderer and everything in between, I don't think another actor could have done a better job. Add a slew of great supporting actors, including a surprisingly decent turn from Jared Leto (whom I normally avoid at all costs)and you have the makings of a classic. <br/><br/>However, the movies somehow just can't live up the mastery of the novel, and the seemingly random switches between Bateman's abstract thoughts and his terrifyingly intimate descriptions of his murders just don't seem to flow here. Also, the movie never lived up to the true disgust created in the novel."

","This was the sort of film that I doubt will garner universal approval, I wasn't sure myself of whether it registered with me or not. It was a unique take on mental psyche which can delve deep but seem on the surface like a straightforward slasher film. Though, I admired its blend of thriller and satire where it doesn't take itself too seriously yet doesn't descend to a comically inept level by maintaining a certain level of tension. <br/><br/>'American Psycho' gives no importance to anything else but for one man who would be satisfied with the attention: Patrick Bateman, a narcissistic, patronising yuppie who is presented in a most enigmatic fashion, a man who has a high flying life yet idealises something more out of the ordinary. His character paints a picture of blatant and oftentimes comical irony. He shows how self obsession can drive you off an edge, how your mind can be the instigator of absolute insanity and emotions ranging from depression to prime aggression without the need for external influence which Christian Bale portrays starkly well. Simultaneously, he acts as quite the paradox as he acknowledges his plunge into insanity and does little to help himself. The greatest irony though is how, after all his attempts, the story comes full circle where his life is just normal, regardless of what he does. <br/><br/>For him, his nocturnal, sociopathic tendencies are all just a game, a simple transgressive indulgence he feels he is entitled to. His motives however are a prime example of the black comedy in the film, they can probably be likened to a young kid throwing a tantrum because other kids have more than him and possessions better than his own. Except Bateman's obsessions with superiority are never too little to kill for.<br/><br/>I've never seen a more confused and directionless character, one conflicted by so many emotions and so intricately complex. I can't imagine an author expecting more out of such an absorbingly curious character than Christian Bale brought out in this pinching satire on personal fulfilment and domination. <br/><br/>""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman"" his self monologue claims and it's left up to you to examine what you see and decide what it is all about, real or imaginative. Don't expect him to give you a determinate answer though. If provoking thought isn't a show of acting mastery on Bale's part and deserved of honours, I'm not sure what is. Yet, even provoking thought needs to have some sense. Yes indeed, this is deep and elaborate. But good cinema."

","I saw this movie for the first time last week. I don't know why it took me twelve years to see the movie but it was worth the wait. This movie was great and Christian Bale was amazing.<br/><br/>The movie has a big theme of being the best in the work place and the protagonist Patrick Bateman (Bale) strives to be the best and when he isn't he takes the easy way out, which is where his alternate ego comes out and through his own insane fantasies he 'eliminates' the opposition.<br/><br/>The way that he does this is one of the greatest ways i've seen. The murder scenes although sometimes bloody and disturbing they also have a comedic prelude of Bateman (Bale) explaining how certain mainstream songs and how much better they are then any other song the artist produced, which in turn made the scenes great.<br/><br/>The one problem that I, and I'm sure others had was the last 10- 15minutes of the movie are very confusing and the director, Mary Harron, has a scene which misleads the audience. I don't want to give anything away because this is a must see, but the ending is a little confusing and some post movie research may be required in order to get what the truth behind the plot was.<br/><br/>Other then the confusing ending this is a great movie and a must see!<br/><br/>All the way from Batemen to Batman, Christian Bale never disappoints."

","In order to start the review I shall mention that this is truly one of my favorite movies. A personal top 10 list perhaps. I watched it several times and every time I found another moment or scene that made me fall in love once more. That is why I wasn't really able to find any flaws in American Psycho, the gripping tale of a Wall Street yuppie, who turns into a ruthless murderer at night. But that you probably already know. What you may not know is that the amount of blood and gore is on a totally different level that in the book. So if you think that this movie is controversial I advise you to read Bret Easton Ellis' masterpiece. Believe me, you won't regret it. The deep insight into the character's mind and much more brutal descriptions of all sorts of tortures make the movie only a enjoyable complement.<br/><br/>This is really the best delusional satire on the Wall Street boom of the 1980's and the presence of a distinct yuppie culture. Every one of the high-positioned businessmen cares only about his looks, bank account and the most expensive food and clothes. Oh, and definitely has no soul whatsoever. No emotional needs. Just look at Bateman. He kills innocent people in order to satisfy his strangest desires and achieve fulfillment. Yet with every killing his cravings become stronger and stronger. He is detached from this world, a true sociopath. But how many of you didn't even once think about killing someone, simply because he did something frustrating? Maybe Patrick is the only one, who is able to present (in a most radical way) his dissatisfaction with humanity and our horrible world. <br/><br/>On a totally unrelated topic - how awesome is Christian Bale's as Patrick Bateman? He fits perfectly, with his handsome face, elegance, style, manner of speaking. It's like he was born for that role (and probably for one more - Bat(e)man - notice that this isn't a coincidence). <br/><br/>I would also like to mention that the fact that glitz and glamor of Oscar-related greatness passed by American Psycho is a good thing. The movie went on to become one of the most thrilling indie horrors of all time and Bale, being an icon to many, was able to go on working on other great projects without the omnipresent burden of awards.<br/><br/>Finally, I would strongly recommend that you watch American Psycho only after reading the book. Then you will be able to appreciate the pure genius of the movie's atmosphere and Bale's acting. It will put a new perspective on your perception of his character. Because, after all, American Psycho is a deeply psychological tale that will keep you focused until the very last minute."

","I rented this film, and watched it for the first time. I knew Christian Bale was a good actor from other films. <br/><br/>The portrayal of Patrick Bateman (Bale), totally blew my mind. He is able to act like a serial killer, and maintain character for this entire movie. I would never have expected him to be so good at it.<br/><br/>The way the screenplay puts the film in the point-of-view of Bateman, from his violent acts, his denial of his sanity, and his inner conflict to not be caught,keeps the movie fresh and suspenseful. You may consider the ending controversial<br/><br/>The direction and other production areas of this film, make a final product much better (in my opinion), than most of the popular Horror/Thriller/Slasher films of all time, While keeping it realistic and modern-time relate-able.<br/><br/>American Psycho, in the end, is one of the best suspense movies i have ever seen.

","American Psycho is an epic mental masterpiece of disturbed human consciousness. At times it as almost hilarious, as much of the situations within the film are so blunt and ludicrous that one cannot help but find them funny. It presents a fascinating perspective of a disturbed man's mind, and society as a whole. Patrick Bateman displays psychotic and homicidal tendencies in plain view of both his fiancée and his coworkers, but they are so engrossed within their own affairs that they take no notice of it, even when he clearly states that he killed ""twenty, maybe forty people"". The ending of the movie is obscure, which can be seen as a positive approach as it allows for the viewer to come to their own conclusions, or a negative approach as it leaves many loose ends within this already strange and incomprehensible film. But whether the viewer chooses to believe that Bateman did in fact brutally murder over a dozen people, or that all of the incidences simply occurred within his restless and unhinged mind, it cannot be denied that this is a fascinating and wildly entertaining tragic masterpiece."
"thepsychocritic","8","0","0","8 January 2012"," Funny murders are always a sight worth beholding.
","Having a psycho, or a lunatic, as the protagonist does make things a whole lot easier for a director. He/she doesn't have to justify anything the protagonist does, because all the acts he commits, regardless of how unfeasible or irrational they are, are forgiven since he is a psychopath. The 'W' word of inquisition is tossed out of the window. For instance, in this film, Patrick Bateman hacks people to death, tries to feed a cat into an ATM machine and hides decapitated heads in his freezer, and all of these atrocities pass unquestioned, for he is, as the title proclaims, the American Psycho. <br/><br/>Americans have really begun scaring me now. American Pie came up with some of the most outrageous sex ideas ever, American Beauty was a thoroughly unsettling experience and American Psycho is eerily disturbing. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a narcissistic banker living alone in a posh New York apartment. He lives a stereotypical banker life - have a girlfriend, sleep with another, a music afiocinado and flirting with his secretary - nothing that calls specific attention to him. However, the banker is just a facade he adopts to fit into the normal world - a Dr. Jekyll to his inner My. Hyde. He has an alter-ego residing inside him, one that has only two emotions - greed and and disgust - and wants to kill people in the most remorseless and sadistic ways imaginable, because that is his definition of catharsis. Patrick Bateman isn't merely misanthropic, he is quite literally the epitome of cruelty. He is a the kind of person who watches The Texas Chainsaw Massacres while exercising, and for whom the hardest conundrum in life is whether he wants to get his next victim with a nail-gun or a chainsaw. <br/><br/>The character of a straight-faced murderer is not just disturbing, but also funny, in a morbid way. Despite having a dark and uncanny atmosphere, the ironies and the obvious pleasure that Bateman gets from heinously murdering hobos, peers, hookers and even random pedestrians with utter indifference makes you cringe and smile at the same time. Every time an axe hacks into his co-worker's flesh with a dull thud as Hip To Be Square plays in the background, you can't help but guiltily laugh to yourself. The murders follow a well established and contemplated about modus operandi and have an aftermath too. Bateman doesn't just kill people. He premeditates the commission, derives ecstasy during the act, and then sits back and relaxes, smoking a cigar, while admiring his handiwork. Bale carries the role of this two-faced beast with perfection. His poker-face maintains the facade, but his frigid gaze gives away the rather inconvenient and a whole lot frightening truth. <br/><br/>What is interesting, is that the film maintains a light-air through the gruesome occurings, like a reflection of the protagonist himself. It talks about visiting cards, about the plethora of cosmetics Patrick uses, often to the sound of a piano cortet or otherwise ebullient music in the background. Even Patrick's apartment is refreshing with clean, white walls, which is an amusing dichotomy with Patrick himself. <br/><br/>Not everything is froody with the film. A character like Patrick Bateman could have become a modern-day icon, if only he had more deeper and an insight had been presented into his psyche. His murders, his vicious idiosyncrasies all seem superficial, making the viewers wonder who he really is, or what made him this way. Between masquerading as a lackadaisical banker and a rabid psychopath, he never really offers an explanation to why he is the man he is. Childhood trauma, car accident, sexual harassment - nothing. <br/><br/>Another disappointing is that the movie introduces too many people without offering a satisfactory ending to all. There is a detective who just doesn't appear in the last thirty minutes, people whose purpose is only to stand by the side of the normal Patrick, a mistress who purpose on screen remains mysterious and even a girlfriend who seems to have been tossed into this mayhem for no reason whatsoever. These, however, are trivial things in the bigger scale of things. <br/><br/>The movie has an ambiguous ending, and this by far, is my favourite part of the film. It lets you choose your own path to reach a satisfying conclusion, but there's one, and the most likely, that asks a really provoking question - who really is more beastly, Patrick or the world? After Patrick commits his crimes, the world and its people try to bury them. Towards the ending, Patrick wanders into his peers apartment where he has stashed away many of the bodies, to find it clean and painted sparkly white, as if nothing ever happened there. The landlady creeps up to him for behind and asks him to leave and to never return, which if pondered upon, is a ghastly and horrifying concept."

","One thing that I never hear mentioned with ""American Psycho"" (around these parts at least) is its production design. And this is one of my favorite things about this movie. The costuming, set dressing and locations all come together to create a believable high-end '80s world. There's genuine atmosphere here, especially with the steamy nighttime streets. It's remarkable because the movie was filmed in Toronto. They did an incredible job with the look of this movie.<br/><br/>The other genius move is the casting of Christin Bale as Patrick Bateman. Hes become an accomplished actor in the last 15 years, without a doubt, but this is still my favorite performance. Bateman's such an empty shell, a societal poser spewing PR blurbs, and Bale infuses him with a manic energy, balancing it with the ever-slipping sanity. His environment is full of the self-absorbed yuppie culture (no one knows anybody else) and his psychosis beautifully satirizes the self-absorbed culture where status rules. There's so much more personality here than the character had on the page.<br/><br/>But in the end, it's a terrific black comedy. The dialogue's chock-full of memorable one-liners (we're talking ""Lebowski"" levels here; even if you haven't see the movie, you've heard the quotes), the songs are great, and when all is said and done, it's just a thoroughly entertaining movie.<br/><br/>9/10"
"arthurff6","8","0","0","13 November 2011"," Charming and sophisticated atmosphere of a horror satire
","Seeming at first sight, and judging by the title, just the initial torrent of psychopathic clichés, the surprise is gratifying when the film is unmasked into sapid entertainment. The immediate ''visceral carnage psycho-thriller'' image, that the headline induces previously, is early replaced by the charming and sophisticated atmosphere of a horror satire.<br/><br/>This macabre tale does not branch away from the main character, played by Christian Bale, who as usual incorporates the personification dexterously. In his enthralling idiosyncrasies, capable of converting a passionate and accurate analysis of the 80's New Wave/Synthpop musical scene into a morbid foreplay for slaughter, the charismatic lunatic carries the movie on mild tension. His misadventures are filled with rabid and lascivious displays of violence, but subtly reflecting the crude humor of a proper black comedy. However, it is not until the approach of the final scene, in a boisterous, confusing sequence, that the interest is awoke for good. These tumultuous events culminate in a not so frustrating open end, adorned with an impenetrable monologue that was surely made to last.<br/><br/>Discovering only later that American Psycho was based on a homonym novel was disappointing, for now the whole possibility of an actual fun reading was ruined or at least seriously compromised. Although never reading the original, I suppose is safe to conjecture that the story was decently portrayed, and this seem to have facilitated the whole ''cult becoming'' path that the film had roam. If not, the closing speech was worth the price of a poor adaptation."

","The film uses dark humor to satirize the '80s. A soulless and greedy society where everybody is focused only on themselves and in how successful they are. It revolves around Patrick Bateman, a 27 year old businessman who goes on a killing spree.<br/><br/>Bateman is a wealthy Wall Street broker, he has a luxurious apartment, an expensive suit and a limo. But at night he turns into a monster and he kills people with little to no sympathy to them.<br/><br/>Every men in this movie is obsessed about his image and Bateman is no exception, he explains us in detail how he works out,what shampoos and body lotions he applies and how he goes to the solarium. He is not only concerned about his physical appearance though, he constantly argues with his co-workers about who has the best business card by explaining in detail what type of letter the card uses and what kind of paper it is. Though, we can verify that all cards look the exact same. They compete to see who gets the dinner reservation on the best restaurant or who has the best client. This serves to show how hollow was the stereotype of the American man back in the '80s.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I noticed that all men look alike, they are all handsome, well educated, intelligent, wealthy, well dressed and they all share the same tastes. Such characters can easily pass by someone else and that is what happens. Bateman is called several names during the movie and he also uses one of those mix ups to commit a murder. This is another example of the stereotype, these self centered people couldn't see around them because they lived for themselves only and thus not caring about anything else.<br/><br/>I specifically loved Christian Bale's acting while he was murdering his victims. He added a little fun to the movie by introducing humor to the character and that was a plus for me, Bale was really the perfect match for the role. From dancing at the sound of Hip to be Squared by Huey Lewis And The News to chasing a hooker through a corridor with a chainsaw in his hands and a killer look in his eyes. This also helps us understand how deranged his mind really was.<br/><br/>The end is rather unpredictable and we get the feeling this lunatic murderer is the only one that actually feels anything towards anyone other then envy, a feeling of remorse. It gets you feeling like you wanted it not to end there and continued to see how it would all unfold after the events that took place in the end, but I guess they just wanted us to fill in the blanks. That ending provoked a confusion and left me to decide which story I wanted to believe in. What about you, what are you going to believe in? You probably won't get the meaning of it all at first and that is why I recommend you watch it as many times as it takes because this is an amazing work of art."

","I found the film to be entertaining but thought the ambiguity in the end was a bit of a cop out. I can accept the ambiguity or lack of clarity in a film by Bergman or Antonioni because the entire films tend to be consistent in their tone and message. ""Blow Up"" is ambiguous in the end because the entire film's premise concerns the lack of certainty in a photographed image - if the photograph can't be trusted, can the crime be proved to have happened? AP ends up being a case of the Unreliable Narrator and it's left to the audience to put the pieces together -- which ultimately don't fit in a coherent way.

"liuruiorp","8","0","0","30 July 2011"," 'My confession has meant nothing'
","A lot of the reviews have focused on the plot on a straightforward basis, but American Psycho is not just a dark comedy or a B movie slasher, but rather an allegory for the negativities of capitalism. Patrick Bateman struggles to convince his own lawyer he had committed the killings the audience had seen him commit earlier in the film. There are various reasons why this is and neither Bret Easton Ellis in the novel or Mary Harron in the film rules decisively on which. <br/><br/>One is that in this convincingly believable 80s NYC yuppie world, people have become so interchangeable that Bateman can kill countless numbers of people without anybody realising, because everyone is so generic. Hence why one of his victims mistake him for a co-worker, and why everyone Bateman knows seems to be Vice-President at Pierce & Pierce, and why the detective and his lawyer thinks his victim, Paul Allen, is alive and in London. <br/><br/>Another possible reason is that people know he has killed people and they simply don't care, because the lives of others don't matter. As Bateman says while he is analysing Whitney Houston,'in this world where it's hard to empathise with others, we can above all empathise with ourselves'. Taken from this viewpoint, the story is an allegory for how the actions of American governments and corporations cause famine and war around the world that result in real world deaths, but we brush them off because it means we in the West can have cheap clothes, food and petrol. <br/><br/>A final interpretation I will offer is that Bateman has fantasised all these killings. In this interpretation Bateman is the victim. His life has become so boring and formulaic, with endless dinners at overpriced, gaudy restaurants, endless discussions about style and beauty tips, that the only way he can feel human is to fantasise about the most brutal and sadistic acts possible. This interpretation is given credence by the cartoonish violence in his final rampage and of course the ending."

","Wow. What a film! All I can say is that this is one of my all time favourite films. It just keeps you entertained. Christian Bale is absolute genius. He goes from being a crazy and deluded killer, to a panicky nerd, to a corny music-buff know-it-all, to a self obsessed business man. And just as Bale's performance does, the story also jumps around. It start out as a Sex In The City style narrated romantic comedy, to an extremely sick and black comedy, to a grisly horror. The scenes where Bateman is explaining his albums are hilarious, as is the scene where he says, ""I experienced a moment of sheer panic when I noticed that his apartment looks out over the park, and was clearly more expensive than mine.' as is the business card scene. And the chainsaw scene is very intense. I have to say though, for it's reputation as a very violent film, although graphic, most violence is offscreen. <br/><br/>My only criticism is the mass murder scene where the car blows up. It if is a hallucination, then it works fine, but if you are in the same belief group as me, (That it all really happened) then you may fell that it is completely implausible and a plot gap. Having said that, this film is my first EVER 10/10."
"quis89","7","0","0","15 March 2011"," Unsettling to say the least
","So much could be, and probably has been, said about this film. It's obviously a commentary on modern society, but it's also a look into one man's psyche. You will come to realize by the end of the film that everything you are seeing is through the almost certainly unreliable point of view of Patrick as he begins to come unhinged.<br/><br/>I want to talk about the end of the film though, because I think it's what will upset viewers of this movie. Throughout the film for the most part, you accept that Patrick is a serial killer. After all, he tells you he is - he takes bloody sheets to the dry cleaner, stabs a homeless man, chops up his coworker. As viewers of films we've been trained to accept what we see as fact. But in the end actions become increasingly more absurd and unrealistic, culminating in a final scene where an ATM tells Bateman to feed it a stray cat, and he goes on a much too over the top shooting rampage. We cannot accept that what we are seeing is actually happening.<br/><br/>I think this is what is so great, yet so annoying, about this movie. There is no catharsis, no resolution, no ""A Beautiful Mind"" moment where we or Bateman finally know for sure what's real and what's not. We're brought to the moment of climax but we don't get the resolution, so we're left feeling frustrated, so to speak. But that's what's so great about it too, because it forces you to think about it, consider it. Unlike so many Hollywood blockbusters that spoonfeed you tripe to gaze at blankly for an hour and a half, American Psycho engages your mind.<br/><br/>The movie is flawed. It's hard for me to put my finger on it exactly, but it's a multitude of little things that alternately alienate and bore the audience, mixed in with many brilliant scenes. It's hard for me to say if this story could've been done better, never having read the novel, but it's hard to pull off this kind of subjective reality on film. But American Psycho is certainly worth watching."

","American Psycho is surely an interesting picture. It has handsome cinematography and a slick tone, and Bale totally commits himself to the role. He remains a very interesting character, and the film has some really great scenes. It surely has ideas behind it, but for all of the film's ambitions, it feels sometimes self-indulgent. Even with it's flaws though it is always entertaining, right until the end, which is very difficult to predict. The biggest accomplishment is probably Bale, who proves himself here and respect should be given where it's due. This film will only benefit from rewatches, and I surely do strongly recommend it only because even if it doesn't amount to much at the end (for me at least) it is still quite ambitious in it's own right, and I am pretty sure it will make many people talk about it.

"monty_lnct","7","0","0","2 June 2010"," American Psycho failed to be a satire and succeeded in entertain us but this movie left me with a question of how much Patrick batman i have inside me?
","American psycho is wickedly funny,thrilling and hilariously shocking movie which doesn't prove or point anything substantial or thought provoking but still entertain you,one of the most controversial movie based on equally controversial novel with the same name.<br/><br/>We all have a evil part of us,a beast inside.Now,it depends upon us how much of it we have.The measure of our success as a human or as asociety can be measured by how we control it.Either we unleash it or we can try to suppress it.this story is about a bank executive who has an alter personality of Patrick batman by which he fantasizes himself being a serial killer.it is very clearly shown in the movie that heis frustrated with the society and the peoples with he live but the reasons for him being so frustrated and annoyed doesn't seemed to be reasonable to me. Yes, he was very highly obsessed with perfection and wanted everything according to him.This is why,he get angry easily but i can say that the feelings aroused in him was innate or inborn in him and it was just his state of mind which make him crazy for blood and violence.<br/><br/>So what was the idea behind the movie?what movie tried to show us? in fact the movie was intended to be a satire about rising frustration and anger among peoples against materialistic society, against the profit oriented ,consumerist world which is full of careerists, hypocrites and liars.but movie failed to made any point because script fall flatly to bring the message in front of us.the result we obtained was of A-grade slasher movie full of comedy and violence,have brilliant performance from Christian bale and a overall good direction from Mary Harron.<br/><br/>the only drawback of this movie is its script.the movie obviously is entertaining.It is funny at one moment and suddenly movie will horrify you and have very witty dialogues.but the movie did not provide completely what you wanted from it and that is the message.they did not provide any valid justification for his actions which makes us dis- connected and distant to the character of Patrick.we felt entertained but untouched.both a clockwork orange and fight club clearly gave reason for anti-hero being highly disturbed and his inclination towards violence but this movie fail short of it. also,the ending was satisfying and disappointing both.we can have our own opinion on that if he really killed them or not,but i think it was only his imagination.it was relieving for me to know that he was not a serial killer but it was also clear that at the end he was not at the better condition too.As he said he is in a constant pain and wanted his pain to be inflicted on other i felt sad for him by realising that the rage and anger inside him will become more and more and it is possible that he will kill someone one day.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was very well directed by Mary Harron.It was really surprising for me that a woman directed such a bold and unusual movie. She handled the project cleverly and provided us the feel we never had from watching from any other movie.everything was perfect-the atmosphere ,the pace,the performances form every single cast, the soundtrack, everything was at the right place.unfortunately she did not get the good support of script, otherwise movie should have been perfect.<br/><br/>But the real highlight of the movie was thundering performance of Christian Bale.i always thought of bale as mediocre actor who cannot bring challenging performances but he proved me wrong.he totally got inside the personality of Patrick batman,his body-language,dialogue delivery ,expressions were mind-blowing.He forced me to laugh at the moments where i should feel disgust.His highly unstable and eccentric portrayal of unsympathetic anti-hero is the performance worthy to be praise and remembered."

","Having now read the book twice and seen the film three times I thought it about time to put my thoughts down in black and white. The short of it is that I loved this film; just when you think you have it sussed out it throws another curve ball at you.<br/><br/>I don't intend to spend much time considering the plot or the well known themes and questions it throws up (the blending into society, the facelessness of individuality, the materialism and commercialism of modern life etc etc) as these have been covered splendidly in the FAQ section and I could not do them any further justice.<br/><br/>My personal, humble opinion it is all in his head; the ending of the book ""This Is Not An Exit"" seemed to me to suggest that his fantasy's were a way out of the mundaity and blandness of his existence. Having said that each time I watch the film or reconsider the book I am left with that grey area that at least some of it may have been very real and then wondering which parts may and may not have been!! <br/><br/>I watched the film having read the book first (as I am sure many others will have done). What struck me was the skill with which the very dense, at times difficult to read dialogue had been condensed into a screenplay that very strongly retained the overriding themes of the book. The style of the film captured perfectly the scenery created by the extremely (overly?) descriptive prose in the book and at no time did it feel rushed. At no time did I think that more should have been included; the choices made when preparing the screenplay (i.e. what to include and what to leave out) were spot on and the focus on Bateman himself with less concentration on the peripheral characters in his life worked perfectly (these were, in fact, the parts of the book that felt contrived and out of place so I was happy with the choices for this reason as well).<br/><br/>It amused me sincerely that the film was adapted and directed by a female. After all the furore by silly feminist women who clearly did not understand the satire in the book and who chose to concentrate on the graphic depiction of violence against women it must be great for Brett Easton Ellis to be able to say ""F*** you"" to them. This film and the book before it are not about gratuitous violence. The story is about greed, about jealously, about psychosis, about a person lost in a myriad of similarity where you cannot break out even if you try and even if those attempts are bloody, violent and evil. There are so many layers to the story that to dismiss it as a one dimensional attempt to shock is doing it a massive disservice. And I think (hope) that anyone watching the film will realise this.<br/><br/>Onto the performances. Christian Bale is, as ever, superb. I am a massive fan of his (apart from Terminator - is it not enough that you're Batman!!) and always look forward to watching his films. He is at his very best here. Batemans facade is slowly slipping as his private world of madness seeps into his personal world and Bale pulls this off with the subtlest of changes in his facial expressions and demeanour. The two telephone conversations (first to his lawyer, second to his secretary) towards the end of the film show the full extent of his psychosis and the fact that his mask has well and truly slipped. The realisation that he has got away with it (and more importantly will continue to get away with it) and his pulling himself back together at the end of the film are all, again, acted perfectly. Contrast the character at the start of the film with that at the end, consider the ""journey"" he has been on and everything in between and then think about how another, less skilled actor could have killed this film. Without Bale this film would not have worked. He IS Patrick Bateman and that is the skill and talent that I so greatly admire.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are fine if not a little bland. Reese Witherspoon is wasted and Batemans colleagues are given very little screen time but therein, I suppose, lies the point. This is a film about an egotistical, maniacal loner who has no love for humanity in any way, shape or form. It seems only right that the relationships he so clearly has no yearning for are not fleshed out any further. Still, it would have been nice to have had a little more depth and a further half hour or so would have done the world of good and probably pushed this into the higher regions of scoring.<br/><br/>As it is this is a really, really enjoyable film that works on so many levels. You will enjoy it as a stand alone film given the performances, writing and direction but those who want to think about it further and make their own judgement on the questions will have plenty to keep them busy.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Very few horror films are entertaining. In fact, most horror flicks are morally flawed, disturbing, and too dark natured. It makes you hate humanity or at least question it. The characters are even worse than the things they do. They're often psychotic, half-human wild-eyed mutants that kill without the consulting of a conscience. Horror is anything evil and sadistic....not fun!<br/><br/>American Psycho is an exception to the rule. Here we have mild-mannered, clean-cut, and charming Patrick Bateman who has a lucrative career as an investment banker in Lower Manhattan, a million-dollar apartment high-rise, and a 6-figure bank account, and snotty, elitist attitude to boot. But, our snotty Yuppie friend has a secret....a dark secret! He happens to be a serial killer that can't be caught! How's that for terrifying! A Yuppie who's a douchebag, pompous jerk, a nerdy white guy is his own right and has a fetish to murder people.<br/><br/>AP is not your average horror film. There's no gore aplenty like in Friday the 13th or the Saw franchise, well there's the part where Bateman chases and eventually kills a woman with a chainsaw down a flight of steps and the bloody scenes inside Paul Allen's apartment. Most of American Psycho's horrid lure is based solely on human psychology wrapped in avant-garde surrealism of 80's Wall Street flash. It's all about craving for absolute attention and being considered a nobody even when you have everything you could ever desire at your feet. Bateman(played by Christian Bale) is both a disturbing and comedic character. Bale's performance has motion rooted in satire and mocks the upper-class lifestyle with perfection. In fact the whole cast except Willem Dafoe and Chloe Sverginy are satirical foils which are at first humorous, then irritating/annoying, then detestable.<br/><br/>The truth is almost every male in this movie is a self-centered asshole<br/><br/>that behaves more like a spoiled teenage girl in a locker room gossipping with her friends rather than executives in a boardroom. All they do is compete and talk behind each others backs. You still have the pompous jerk alpha male, the slut, the pure innocent girl, the geek, and the killer himself. With all horror films, the jerk, old bum, a few sluts, indeed get murdered, but it's done so brilliantly and with such discretion. American Psycho is enjoyable for having already obnoxious and rather stupid characters meeting there demise(except the homeless guy with the dog in the alley) that deserve to get killed. You're catching yourself cheering for Patrick Bateman whose the serial killer! Wow! A horror movie that makes you think is a wonderful experience that no one ever experimented before. It's like Sweeney Todd, only this time no one loses an eye and fun doesn't seem to stop! <br/><br/>My only criticism is that it could've used more of the 1980's stylistic touch, pastel-colored clothing, a Ferrari Testarossa speeding down Fifth Avenue, etc. What American Psycho should've done was focus on the mid-80's which truly defined the decade in question and evolve into the early 1990's. Because no one remembers 1988 and 1989 that much."
"moviesleuth2","7","0","0","5 December 2009"," Provocative satire of the 80's
","I watched this movie a few years ago and although I respected it, I didn't care for it because it was so superficial. I watched it again, realizing what it was trying to do. This time I liked it a lot better.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a Wall Street wizard, living the dream life. He's young, successful, and good looking. But everything is not right with Patrick. He is incapable of any emotion ""except greed and disgust."" He sees himself as a facade (""I am simply not there""). But while living the good life by day, he is a serial killer by night.<br/><br/>For anyone who follows the politics of movie making, ""American Psycho"" is one of the more notorious. It's yet another example of the MPAA's prudishness getting in the way of film-making. The film was given an NC-17 rating until director Mary Harron was forced to cut a scene where Bateman is having a threesome with two prostitutes. Never mind that it is extremely revealing about his character, nor the fact that they left all of the bloody violence untouched. It's a sex-scene, which is a no-no for the MPAA (none of its members, apparently, have cable television, because if they did, they would notice that there are more explicit sex scenes on weekly TV shows).<br/><br/>But that shouldn't detract from the quality of the film (the unrated DVD has been out for a few years, so there's no need to accept the MPAA's neo-conservative version). The film is well-acted, and often darkly humorous.<br/><br/>Christian Bale burst onto the A list after his dynamite performance as Bateman. His cool, smooth voice belies his capacity for violence. Yet Bateman can change moods instantaneously, and Bale is adept at switching moods at will, even only for a few seconds. The other cast members (Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, and so on) are great as his friends and co-workers (or fiancée, as Witherspoon is), who are so superficial and self-centered that they don't know, or care, about Bale's extracurricular activities (and it's not as if he's THAT discreet about it). Samantha Mathis is good as is drugged-out mistress, and Willem Dafoe is solid as the private detective who may or may not be onto Bale.<br/><br/>Mary Harron knows and understands the material. It's a thriller, but also a dark comedy. The humor isn't in your face, but if you really think about it, these characters are completely ridiculous. She's not afraid to show violence, but she also knows that she's not making a slasher movie.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I'm not a child of the 80's, but I didn't get all the humor. I got the satire about being superficial, but the serial killer aspect eluded me. Still, it's enjoyable enough to recommend."
"PeterRoeder","7","0","0","30 November 2009"," Fairly good adaptation
","I just saw this yesterday. I think Christian Bale is a great actor also in Equilibrium and Batman, and he really does a good job playing Patrick Bateman. Anyway, having also recently read the book, I don't think it did a fair job to the book. Anyway, that is impossible. It is like the adaptation of Watchmen. Simply impossible, so why even try? Nevertheless, both the Watchmen movie and the American Psycho movie has turned out to be rather interesting. A weak aspect of the American Psycho movie was that some of the interesting dialogue was cut out. For example, Ted Bundy's name is mentioned in the book but left out in the movie. It would have been powerful to hear Ted Bundy's name spoken out in the movie, since the Bateman character is incredibly much inspired by Ted Bundy's story. Actually, it is amazing what a genius Breat Easton Ellis is. He is like a living Dostoyevski. His psychological insight into the Bateman character is incredible, and naturally this is impossible to bring to the big screen."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","24 September 2009"," Cutting 80's satire
","Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" is an adaptation of the infamous book by Bret Easton Ellis. As a film it's tough to categorize. It's part horror flick, part crime thriller, part drama and part satire. It's a bit of a tough sell since those interested in blood & guts aren't likely to grasp the film's thematic underpinnings while those interested in delving beneath the surface may be turned off by the film's violence.<br/><br/>The meat of the flick lies in the script. A reading of the novel would probably improve comprehension for some but I've never read it and I understand it just fine. For all of its outward appearances as a slasher flick, the film is actually an astute commentary on conformity in the slick business world of the 1980's. The film employs touches of black humour while also functioning as a compelling thriller.<br/><br/>The cast includes Christian Bale in one of his best performances to date. For me, this role, along with his part in ""Velvet Goldmine"" a couple of years earlier, made him a notable young actor in my eyes. The cast also includes some other noteworthy names like Chloë Sevigny, Jared Leto & Willem Dafoe. As I see it, the only weak link is Reese Witherspoon, who just strikes me as out of place.<br/><br/>Mary Harron's direction fits the subject matter well. Much of the film has a sleek, polished look which fits Patrick Bateman's character to a tee. The film's score nicely complements the visuals and a handful of inspired soundtrack choices help to establish the film's satirical bent.<br/><br/>In the end, ""American Psycho"" is definitely not a film for everyone. I recommend it if you're not particularly bothered by screen violence and you appreciate stories with depth and a satirical tone."

","This film was OK really. I mean its not really the masterpiece some people are claiming it to be. Its a matter of opinion really. Its good in the respect that it shows the extent of madness a serial killer reaches before their 'burn out' and just by including a 'burn out' it stays true to the profile of a serial killer. <br/><br/>I didn't read the book but I'm sure it was probably better than the film as the books always are! <br/><br/>I don't think they could really have anymore gore, it would probably ruin the serious intentions of the film and turn it simply in to a typical American horror/thriller like the remake of 'The Hills Have Eyes' (which I love by the way) where they try to fit as much death, gore and blood in to one sitting without over stepping boundaries with certification.

For example, we see that no matter what this guy did, for all his affected excellence, he was always on the B list whereas his nemesis was always on the A list.<br/><br/>The writer of the book was a spoiled Beverly Hills brat who was probably not as good a writer as the connects his money bought. And though this was based on a Canadian killer, the models from which he drew were geeks. Maybe the writer saw this guy as a powerful guy but in the end most powerful guys are geeks. And really childish. I worked in Silicon Valley in the 80s, any of the guys I worked with could have been substituted in for any of these characters in the book/movie, and they were geeks. I worked with one of the writer's best friends, he was a royal geek. I think the characterizations made in the movie were dead on. No pun intended."

It leaves room for your own interpretation. I also think that most people understand that the majority of events is his imagination,(you can't really run naked through a hallway carrying a chain saw...), the biggest question is: is it Bateman's imagination or somebody else's? Is the name Patrick Bateman also part of his imagination? But on the other hand other characters also mention the name Bateman. So he probably exists."
"manicman84","7","0","0","11 August 2006"," suspenseful thriller filled with dark humor
","American Psycho is a suspenseful thriller in which dark humor prevails over probability. The film works thanks to Christian Bale who gives an intriguing, convincing performance being, on a par with that in The Mechanist, the best in his career. His villain is incredibly degenerate due to the sick, aristocratic community in which he lives. His main hobby, apart from murdering of people in various ways, is listening music and talking about it, which leads to many hilarious situations in the film. What was also shrewdly used in the script are seemingly minor obsessions, like owning prettier business cards. The flick tears to shreds wealthy aristocratic environment which is responsible for arising sick atmosphere among people occupying the top positions as well as puts a question about individual's responsibility. Thus, the message is very similar to that in Woody Allen's Match Point. However, in American Psycho black humor is used instead of metaphorical meaning."
"nexus-37","9","0","0","23 May 2006"," Great horror-comedy made of a great book
","Christian Bale does great casting in this funny, sarcastic and sick comedy. Although lot of scenes were taken directly from the book, this is totally different. Yes, there is Bateman, Louis, Evelyn and others but putting this together as a movie makes it truly humorous. Book itself wasn't so humorous, lot of sarcasm painted with black humor and sick stuff all over detailed, still this movie isn't much of a horror movie at all.<br/><br/>For those who hadn't read the book...<br/><br/>It's late in 1980s. Movie follows the story of a 27 years old Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street broker with lots of money and nothing to lose. Patrick is kind of a person that doesn't care about anything, doesn't get any satisfaction of anything, self-hatred, schizophrenic person and doesn't like anybody. Still he is wearing his mask of sanity to spread in, not to be noticed too much in the crowd so that he can execute his sick fantasies for real. Or does he..? Very much fun watching, great characters, great directing, never really losing to touch. Some people just can't understand this movie. It's a movie you shouldn't take too seriously and still, you haven't to be empty-minded while watching.<br/><br/>This is good.<br/><br/>Great movie, 9/10. Anyway I recommend first reading the book, then watching the movie. I don't think I'd get it at all if I hadn't read book first.<br/><br/>Truly worth of watching for most people and of course horror-movie fans especially."
"myboigie","10","0","0","12 February 2006"," The American 1980s in All Its Soulless-Glory
","This is a personal-favorite, though I wonder how-much of it is really horror. It certainly has elements-of-horror, but I see it as more of a personal-allegory, and a social-one that would do Herman Melville proud. OK, it is horror! Social-horror: these are the people in-charge of our world! For those familiar-with the novel, this is a more toned-down affair by Mrs. Harron, a superb-director, who sticks-to the social-themes and implications of the story. There are some scenes of gore, but they are significantly toned-down and minimized, and I think the move was a wise-one. Sometimes, gore detracts too-much from the narrative and the themes of a film, but not here. Reagan America seems pretty innocent to us nowadays, but it was rife with greed and cronyism, and even some of the disastrous military-adventurism we are seeing today (Grenada, 1983, the first-time the press was barred-from an invasion). Sadly, the militarist-culture of Reagan has continued. The seeds of present-day scandals and corruption were being planted during the 1980s.<br/><br/>The poor were neglected (and still are), and the mentally-ill were ""deinstitutionalized"", while military-spending blossomed, and there were financial-scandals-galore--then finally, Iran-Contra and a stock market crash. In the cities, a bull-market of speculation had exploded, and there was a materialist obsession with ""luxury-items"", high-priced art, and ridiculous cuisine and fashion-trends that would make a Flapper blush-with-shame. 1980s-fashion is best summed-up as: big-shoulders, no-compassion. Clothing was absolutely ugly, trashy and vulgar, which reflected the times, a Hobbesian-hell of winner-take-all. This, then, is the world of the character Patrick Bateman. People didn't want to know, hear, or talk-about social-problems in the 1980s, which has taken a 180-degree-turn nowadays, a crucial-difference. This--at-least--has changed. The laws of physics provided the soil.<br/><br/>What Harron argues, finally, is that Patrick Bateman is unremarkable as a serial-killer within-the-context of the immorality he is surrounded-by. His exact-job is murky, and the firm he works-for is only referred to as ""Pierce & Pierce"" in the film. It also appears he is the benefactor of nepotism from his father, and appears to be creating nothing. What should be noted is that the director's husband produced corporate videos for ""Merrill-Lynch, Pierce & Pierce"" (which she states on both DVDs), so there is more-familiarity between Ellis's book than we would expect. Indeed, I am friendly-with people who work-at ""Merrill-Lynch..."", who confirm that the corporate-culture depicted in the film is accurate--so accurate, when the film came-out, their colleagues opined that they ""could relate to Patrick Bateman"". Make of that what-you-will. So, it isn't a stretch to see the similarities in how corporations devalue human-life with that of a serial-killer. There are similarities in-psychology here, such as viewing people as nothing-more than objects (which Bateman does on numerous-occasions, including watching porn) to be used as one wishes. Maybe this is the heart of horror in ""American Psycho"", both the novel and the film.<br/><br/>Ellis's novel came out of his being immersed in this New York-environment (Harron lived there at the time too), and he spent more time than he cared-for with people who shared the attitudes of the Bateman character. He saw murder as a short-step from the amorality and immorality of the Wall Street playboys, and Patrick Bateman can be viewed as a composite and abstraction of these types. By 1987, the stock-market crashed--it was the other Black Friday. Without New Deal controls and protections, we would likely have had another Great Depression (wait, the other-one is coming). 1987 was also the year that Iran-Contra was revealed, and the 1980s-dream which was a nightmare for many. The Reagan-80s were over. And yet, it all continues today in-spades: the corruption, the murder, the lies, and the amorality of those who feed on us. It is significant that the film ends in 1987, and that Bateman has ""learned nothing"". Horror-indeed."
"surferbabe_ca","Null","0","0","9 January 2006"," After all Bateman may not even be there in flesh, he is an idea of something, something so empty inside but still trying to look convincing.
","American Psycho is one of my all time favorite movies, maybe it is because so many people find themselves to be deeply confused after seeing it. My suggestion is that you see the movie for a couple of times, focusing on little details. Personally it took me three times to restructure my own interpretation. I am afraid I will not suggest you to read the book because first of all I believe the movie and the book should be considered separately. I don't think you need to read the book to interpret the movie, that is of course if you are not stuck in things like murders that we face during the movie. American Psycho takes more than that, it is a pure criticism. I have to warn you that the following sentences will be representing my own interpretation of the movie. American Psycho is a true work of art and the person we recognize as Patrick Bateman is simply not a character in the common sense. He is the human version of a life style, so we do not witness Patrick Bateman's story, what we see in the film is the criticism of American Wallstreet top life. He may be considered as a symbol but not as a simple human being. To those who still argue if the murders are real or not; yep they may be real. But then how does he get away it? Well, the characteristics of his construction gives him the freedom to change, a life style is not something static. Reconsider the scene in which he shoots the company guard. Just some seconds later we see the scene again but only this time Bateman pulls out a pen instead of the gun from his pocket. This is I believe evidence enough for the characters unusual nature. Observe Bateman's colleagues. Observe them as Bateman states ""inside, inside is not important."" See how they behave. You will find a lot of clues that suggest Patrick is something formed from his circle of friends. After all Bateman may not even be there in flesh, he is an idea of something, something so empty inside but still trying to look convincing."

","First of all I need to say I did not read the original but watched a masterpiece of a movie.<br/><br/>It's a groundbreaking thrilling movie and outstandingly hilarious at the same time which is definitely its greatest accomplishment.<br/><br/>As you get to know Bateman you discern that on the one hand he's riven by his desire to conform with the rules of high society and its values and on the other hand yearns for leading a meaningful life of individuality. These two conceptions conflict massively causing him to drift into a surreality in which he takes the role of a serial killer who kills preferably young pretty girls.<br/><br/>Gore and violence are now Bateman's compensations for real life values like friendship and love. But as he states repeatedly he feels nothing, is emotionless. <br/><br/>Slaughering his way from carnage to carnage he eventually finds himself more meaningless than ever before as his lawyer, who doesn't even know him by face, mistakes him for somebody else and is not believing his desperate confession.<br/><br/>Bateman's inner conflict, which is by the way one of the most funniest features of the movie, is portrayed outrageously just because it's never intended to be taken much too serious. So it causes you to laugh about Bateman's behavior several times which is not common for that kind of film genre. These exceptions makes that film complete and unique.<br/><br/>One last comment on the actor's performances, let me start with Christian Bale who really fit into that role. He totally impersonated Bateman. Willem Dafoe as a sharp detective who is always ambiguously indicating his doubts about Bateman's innocence, played his part brilliantly too. <br/><br/>A complete movie with little not worth of mentioning flaws which never had a bad effect on the movie itself.<br/><br/>8/10 One of my favorites."

","Of all the psycho killer movies I've seen, this one tops the list. The best part is the dead pan acting by Christian Bale who portrays Patrick Bateman. He acts like he's a normal person, but it's clear that he's ""not there"" and thinking about psychotic things that's coming into his mind every minute. On the surface he's a successful yuppie bachelor who has everything one can wish for - a good job, high pay, good social life, and a successful career. The scariness of this movie is the contrast of this good life to the total mess that's going on inside his head. In the end a detective comes around looking for him for suspicion of killing his friend Paul Allen. He makes excuse that he heard Paul Allen say he's going to London while he knows he killed him. But then another friend says he saw Paul Allen in London. At this point Bateman's mind is so messed up that it's not clear anymore if he actually killed a person, or just killed him in his fantasy, and the fact that police is after him is no longer an issue because his mind is already in a far worse place than any prison. <br/><br/>Based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis, American Psycho is a great story because the contrast between the yuppie career of Patrick Bateman and his craziness is so far apart. If anyone has a choice between becoming a psycho killer or a successful businessman, no one will choose the psycho killer. But in Bateman's case, his insanity is so strong that despite his good position, he can't help keep on killing. The story portrays the double sided character of Bateman well, and Christian Bale does a fantastic job playing the character. A movie worth seeing."

","It walks a fine line of funny and horrific but your in the mind of a psychopath so that what it would be. It is an excellent movie. With the perfect cast and the arrogant acting is so realistic.The main character rambles like a narcissist and believes the smallest things are the most important.He is scary because he is exactly like all those people that work in corporate environments.The realize is the scary part of all movies and this seemed like a 1980's video flash back to the days of the yuppies. I would save time and just buy it.This way you can watch it alone and then put together a party of friends and co-workers that this movie would be perfect for. Its great on many levels.

The biggest is the scene where he returns to Paul Allen's Apartment to find it completely restored, and you never find out who cleaned it up, and why the lady made such a big deal about the whole thing. Also you gotta love the scenes that display the corporate world that he lives in, and things that are truly important to entrepreneures."

","""My name is Patrick Bateman. I am twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh floor..."" Patrick Bateman establishes his persona quickly: cold; cynical; emotionless; self-involved - a raging Larry David. Based on Bret Easton Ellis' late 80's fictional book, ""American Psycho"", the story was rewritten for the screen, and deviates at times. Patrick might be said to be an image of Bret, a reflection of an over-obsessed materialistic metro-sexual with a grumble for blood and the suffering of others.<br/><br/>""My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy."" Is Patrick akin to our true-selves, in the Freudian sense? Is the attraction to his character due to the envy of his ability to cathartically release his daily fits of rage upon those around him? Perhaps the film is therapeutic in this way, as we live out our logically constructed fantasies through Patrick. But are any of Patrick's ""wrongdoings"" real? The question is left with the viewer, in that reality must be measured against psychological defense mechanisms.<br/><br/>But Patrick, whether actually or artificially, lets his emotions flow, and the film gives a superb, terse yet detailed snapshot of this process. Some may disagree, and the film has had mixed reviews, yet, the movie is a final statement. An ode to metro-sexual men, spawning their veil of ignorance during the latter 80's. It gives to us a view of ourselves which touches upon the incredibly competitive aspects of society, and the way it reveals itself, even subtly.<br/><br/>Patrick and his clan, Wallstreet brokers, busy themselves with details like the font on their business cards, Oliver People glasses, restaurants, etc. They are all narcissists living empty lives, filling the void with belongings and good looks. They struggle, unprepared, with their ""new"" material desires: in Patrick's case, they overflow. They hate each other, and have perhaps no direction. Fashioned with a strong story and fine acting, alongside its take on a phenomena just surfacing in the time it was depicted, this film is a milestone both cinematically and, as one of the few mainstream American films to take seriously mans transition from the traditional roles they subscribed to in the 50's-70's. <br/><br/>It is recommended, if not for the feeling of a release on society, but for a look at what first generation metro-sexuals were like in their niche."

It is important that when you watch american psycho that you view the main character (Patrick Bateman) not as a character, but as a symbol symbolising humanity.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman all throughout the movie admits to his life violent frenzy and escapade of shopping whilst walking up to ""fags"" as he refers to them, and calling them what some may cool rude and undeserving names. But at the end of the movie... he states one of the greatest things I think ever said...

","*Contains some spoilers*<br/><br/>This film will divide many audiences (and quite deservedly)but it is definitely a must see, even if you do end up hating it.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is the epitome of 1980s self-obessession- hes obsessed with his body, his looks, his image... and his business cards. However nobody appears to care- as they are all too self obsessed themselves, even to the point when Patrick says to somebody that he's in to ""murders and executions"", without them batting an eyelid. So why does he bother? Well, thats for the audience to decide... and their decision to the answer is a frenetic one. <br/><br/>Despite all that I've said, I didn't like this film. I found its messages all too obvious and whiney and the character of Patrick Bateman as more of a self-parody than anything else. But maybe thats the point of the film?<br/><br/>
That said, there is much to recommend it, most notably Christian Bale's depiction of nut-job Bateman. He has many good lines throughout the movie, and is as good as any anti-hero you're likely to get in a mainstream Hollywood film like this. Also the scenes with the two prostitutes are hilarious. I especially like the moment, where his idea of pillow talk involves chatting about how Phil Collins made Genesis one of his favourite bands. The conclusion also must be taken with a pinch of salt- although it does seem to be too much like Taxi Driver for my liking (the classic did he or didn't he do it situation).<br/><br/>However overall this movie seems like a wasted opportunity- as a satire it seems as shallow and underdeveloped as its central character and not half as much fun. It could have been profound. What it is, as it stands, is so awful its quite good- in a trashy way of course"

It really didn't matter, because what you were watching was a trendy flasher movie gone wrong, it wasn't clever, well not in my mind, but it did have shock tactic which it used to the full extreme.

At first you are hit with the utter weirdness of this guy's mannerisms...no one would associate with this wacko in real life. <br/><br/>
At first you figure ""he's overplaying.""  Then, as you get deeper into the film, you realize what is going on here.  This is not life in the real world.

But, once you get it, the film is much more enjoyable and it finally begins to make a sort of bizarre sense.<br/><br/>For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air.

"zeroman_987","Null","0","0","11 July 2002"," one of the best movies of all time
","Spoiler Alert i have been reading some of the comments posted here about American Psycho. I have noticed that some of the people are missing the point of the movie. He is a man who believes he is an empty shell. He has acute depression and seeks the acceptance of others (hence the attempts to fit in). Part of the depression is the emptyness of materialism. It shows what happens when you have everything you could possibly want and get bored because that is usually what happens in today's ""disposable"" society. It also relays the message of the loss of dignity of human life and the disposableness of life (no i am not religious but i have experianced extreme materialism in myself and i have realized that it is pretty much empty). He had a limitless supply of drugs, sex, everything. *shrug* He was tired of ""normal"" sex he had to get videos of ""slasher"" sex (there is a scene where there is a man with a chainsaw...if you have read less than zero there is a similer video where a man has sex with a girl and a guy and castrates the guy, with a chainsaw.) He just wanted some ""thrills"" and got addicted to killing or maybe got addicted to dreaming about killing people. it asks the question ""How far will we go for entertainment"" Will we kill people just to watch them die. Sure he was insane. Personally, i think he killed some of the people if not all. This is why.<br/><br/>The Woman he was walking next to on the street: the next day he comes in to the dry cleaner with a ""bloody"" sheet. Is it really cranberry juice or wine? Did he decide in his head it was blood? Is it really blood? I think it really is blood. I think he really killed someone...if not her than someone else he found.<br/><br/>Al the begger: it is very reasonable to assume he killed Al. He was a bum and police probably wouldnt spend to much time investigating it. I personally believe him when he says he killed a lot of bums.<br/><br/>Paul Allen: This is the big one. Did he kill a man over a business card. Lets look at the facts. In the opening of the movie on of the guys mistakes someone else in the restaurant for Paul (it might have been bryce). This shows that people dont know what others exactly look like and they pretty much look the same and can be easily mistaken for someone else. Second A reservation was made under Halberstrand's name. This shows us that he planned on going to dinner with Paul because Paul mistook him for Halberstrand. Next the dinner scene with Paul. The dinner is in a very empty restaurant. This is makes sense, if i planned to kill someone i wouldnt want a lot of people to see me with them. Fast Forward to the actually killing scene. Bateman takes some pills. It doesnt specify what type and its hard to deduce what type because there is no mention of a physchatrist at all in the movie yet they are perscription pills. Fast Forward to the return to Paul Allen's apartment after the incident with the hooker and Elizabeth. The walls are pristine. Yet, i see an expression of urgency in the landlady's face. This is an expensive apartment. Bad press could lose them a lot of money. Isnt it possible that the management had it cleaned out so they could release the condo and turn a very nice profit out of Paul Allen's ""dissapearance""? Remember what the main theme of the movie is: materialism at its worst. I wouldnt put it past them...Of course this is all conjecture but it gives you something to think about. Oh and a final note. The lawyer who didnt recognize Bateman. Was this a cover up? Once again facial expressions leave some doubt as to whether or not the laywer is making it up when he says he had lunch with paul. In addition, He may have mistaken someone else for paul fairly easily.<br/><br/>The Hookers: he could get away with killing hookers, maybe even call girls. Seriously. With enough money people get away with murder all the time. There is not a doubt in my mind.<br/><br/>I am probably forgetting things but this is a long post anyway, i hope it has given you all something to think about."

By the time the end rolled around, I was thankful that I could stand up, walk around, exercise my legs, and return this to Blockbuster. It was confusing, weird, and I couldn't see anything beyond that because I was so bored watching it. Then I read the reviews on it. To my utter surprise, everyone liked it, like a lot. Compliments were given to the writing, directing, themes, and plot. So I thought I had overlooked something. I rented it again. Nope. It was no more entertaining, no less boring, and no more good, period. So all of this was supposed to be in Bateman's head? Where did that come from? Call me stupid, but I really don't like movies that make you think beyond the point of interpreting the entire ending more than once. The only good parts in the movie WERE the parts where Bateman was killing people, then I learn it's all supposed to be imagined? Wow, that's entertainment!? A lot of references are made to the '80s culture and materialism, which serves as sort of a satire/joke, but let's face it, do we care? The attempt to manifest something in the movie that you can't see on screen is a good attempt by the director. In fact, it might have even worked if the movie had not been such a terrible bore. It's supposed to be understood that Bateman is what all of us are inside. You can take that trip into the dark recesses of the human mind if you want to, but do you have a high tolerance for confusing stories, slow pacing, and one too many inside jokes dealing with the yuppie culture? I appreciate what the film tried to do, and it is very technically well made. The camera movement and angles are very good, the acting is excellent, and the weird style it has is pulled off well, it remains weird without getting too serious. However, I can't sit on my butt for two hours watching something like this without getting up out of my chair every five minutes. Now if there were a few more murders, maybe a little more suspense, and more logic added into this, then I guess I could manage.

I was hesitant to watch it because I thought that it was going to be a cheezy horror flick when it was anything but. It's an intelligent commentary on corporate America in the 1980s, about the modern Manhattan buoguesie (spelling?).

","Regardless of all the controversy, I just loved and love Brett Easton Ellis' novel. I thought and think it's a bold, challenging and tremendously original work and not just anyone can fully appreciate all the dark humour and despair beneath the gory surface.<br/><br/>The film adaptation shows the depths of the novel refraining from its cruelty. Even though it boasts some shocking scenes (ie the chainsaw) the nature of the impact is mainly psychological and relies very much on the impressive performance by Christian Bale, once again proving the wonderful actor he is. Rather than being dark and ambiguous with respect to the main character, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have chosen to look at him from outside thus exposing his pathetism and twisted sense of reality, therefore avoiding any chance of glamorisation of the character, and the film is constantly mocking his yuppie macho conceit, something the novel left the reader to do him/herself. Also, it deserves to be noted that the film is much more woman-friendly than the novel could possibly ever be, most female characters (including the melancholy Courtney) being sympathetic. There is no scope for mysoginy here.<br/><br/>To sum up, this is a more accesible, much less ambiguous approach to a difficult character. While the novel is fascinating because it constantly pushes you to new limits as a reader, the film becomes a highly witty parody of it all. A bit more of social criticism is missing in this adaptation but however thumbs up to Harron for her feminist way of treating an unbearably ridiculous mysoginist lunatic."

He does a great job as normal everyday guy who's a complete schizophrenic. He comes off as a guy you would like to have as a friend but won't want to get mad.

","(includes spoiler)<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed the movie; it was an interesting, disturbing, and telling commentary on the uselessness of excessive consumerism and of fitting in for its own sake.  However, the film did not live up to its potential.  In my opinion, the storyline was muddled and seemed to be going in at least two different directions, and the ending resolved none of these possible plots.<br/><br/>Having said that, and having read the comments already posted, I'd like to say that the interpretation that most satisfies me is the following:  I believe that Bateman never really killed anyone.  As he got wrapped up in his neatly packaged but unsatisfied life, he began to fantasize about breaking out of the mold he had set for himself by taking his aggressive lifestyle to the extreme, in the form of brutally murdering those equally lifeless co-workers and women around him.<br/><br/>This would explain the wild scenes of murder that are shown on screen, culminating in the killing spree at the end.  His imaginings become more and more outlandish as he sinks into further mental collapse.  For example, Paul Allen was never killed - he actually did go to London and was seen by his lawyer (Bateman knew he was going there before he created the revenge scene in his head.  Even the detective was imagined (it was his way of setting up someone to unsuccessfully catch him; and if he were real, how could he have known about the Huey Lewis song being so relevant?)  In the end, he's compelled to try to bring his fantasies into the real world, but no one believes him, and you're left wondering how much deeper into psychosis will Bateman go.<br/><br/>Of course, I could be completely wrong, and he did kill 30 people and the movie was about how society could not recognize him for what he is (a regular guy who literally kills to get ahead), but the former interpretation is my opinion."

","""American Psycho"" is a ...good horror movie. But it is not worthy of the hype it got at Sundance. I guess I should be thankful to Lions Gate for releasing the movie uncut in Canada (with an R rating nonetheless). The 'offensive' scene is very graphical, yet it shows even more how much did Bateman love himself. <br/><br/>Christian Bale is stunning as Patrick Bateman, a personality-free and moral-free killer. The man is completely incapable of feeling pleasure, unless he kills someone or he embellishes himself even more. He washes himself extremely thoroughly, not because he is a clean freak, but because it takes time to wash different parts of the body with different kinds of soaps. He uses more lotion cream than a woman, just to have a nice skin. Porn movies have absolutely no effect on him, yet he watches them like someone would watch a regular movie. There is a very funny scene when he talks on the phone with his lover (not girlfriend), and in the background a porn movie is playing on TV, he doesn't even look at it. While having sex with two women, he watches himself on TV (he was videotaping himself) and in the mirror. He is so self absorbed that he doesn't let anyone touch him, unless he wants to. I love the scene when he starts to hate Paul (Jared Leto). His face turns so ugly that he becomes frightening.<br/><br/>The film has some genuinely hysterically funny moments. After becoming jealous on one of firm's partners, he decides to kill him. He goes to the restroom, and gets ready to strangle the guy, but he doesn't get the chance to do it. The 'victim' who was gay and had the hots for Bateman, thinks that his passes are being answered and takes Bateman's hand and kisses it. He is so shocked that he can't find the exit faster. I roared with laughter. Now there was a first. Being gay actually saved the partner's life.<br/><br/>
Another character that I cared about was Jean, his secretary. Chloe Sevigny is wonderful in a small role and I felt happy that Bateman didn't kill her.<br/><br/>
The script is very well written. I have never read the book, and I have no intention to do so, yet I am very satisfied with the script. The interesting part it is that it is written by two women, capturing a huge amount of the novel's misogyny. <br/><br/>The movie isn't however perfect. The ending is unsatisfactory yet interesting. It is also confusing. <br/><br/>Yet the movie is brilliant, and it is a pity that it will never be a box-office hit. <br/><br/>8/10."

","I've been reading a lot about American Psycho for a few days now, and having just seen the movie, I am at a loss as to what all the fuss is about or why this movie seems so divisive.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a pretty solid picture.  It isn't great, and far from the next Silence of the Lambs as some have suggested, but it does have its moments and on the whole is worth the time and money to see.<br/><br/>The main reason to see this picture is for the performance of Christian Bale.  This is a star-making performance if I have ever seen one. Throughout the picture I was reminded of Tom Cruise, especially Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut.  His performance is both funny and disturbing at the same time, a very difficult line to walk.  Some of his scenes, where he is discussing his music while preparing to kill, is brilliant in the way Bale builds the insanity and detachment of his character.  You can see it in his eyes, that this character knows no remorse and that killing to him is not so much a choice as a personality flaw, to put it mildly.<br/><br/>A lot has also been said of the satire this film has of the 80's yuppie lifestyle.  That aspect of the film was one that didn't particularly resonate me.  I thought it was a bit heavy-handed, but the 80s yuppie lifestyle served as a very effective backdrop for the better story of the<br/><br/>hollow shell of a man who kills because he feels he has to.<br/><br/>There are bad parts to this film.  I thought some of the characters were unnecessary and some of the storyline muddled, but at the same time those weaknesses contributed to the haunting feel of the film, the world through a serial killer's eyes, where no human being is likeable or of value and the day to day lifestyle seems almost as insane as a killing spree.  There were times when I wasn't sure what was happening, but I suspect that was true for the character on the screen as well, which is why it worked even when it seemed convoluted.<br/><br/>For all it's flaws, this is a good picture.  And whatever you think of the film, everyone has to admit that they left the theater thinking, and that this film has been on their minds for days after.  While for some that will be seen as a contemptuous thing, for me that is the mark of a good film. I gave it an 8."

"John-405","Null","0","0","17 April 2000"," A bit disappointing
","The creed of American yuppies in the 80s can be basically summed up as ""egoism"" -- the formalism of selfishness, an ethic whose only constraint is punishment.  In the absence of punishment anything goes, and, if you play your cards right, risking punishment can be just as innocuous as, say, risking your life each time you get into an automobile.  If all there is is the self, why should there be any constraint on action except punishment of the self?  A smart, careful business plan seeks to minimize risk, of course, but risk must be the price paid for getting what you want.  No pain, no gain, as we used to say in the 80s.<br/><br/>It is a fact that the majority of murders go unsolved. It is compelling to imagine a yuppie egoist, therefore, on Wall St in the 80s, who accepts the risk of punishment as an acceptable price to pay for the reward of indulging in pleasure killings.  The ""logic"" of this decision is as compelling as the logic of laying off thousands to raise your stock price or trashing the environment so your comapny can be a 2 billion dollar company instead of just a billion dollar one.  Why let compassion get in the way of gettin' what you want?<br/><br/>This script seems to miss this tantalizing allegorical angle in favor of becoming yet another Hitchcock-esque thriller. Patrick Bateman isn't a coldly calculating yuppie weekend murderer, he's an out-of-control psycho, who scrawls grotesque scenes of torture in his appointment book and who thinks the ATM machine is telling him to feed it cats.  This is a comforting view of serial killers, one that makes them so different from you and me that we can comfortably and conveniently avoid asking the hard questions about what turns a human being into a murderer.  Eh, they're just nuts! My, how illuminating.<br/><br/>What if serial killers weren't just nuts?  What if they were rational, even, after a fashion, ""normal"" people who had intelligently rationalized themselves into turning off their consciences?   There are a lot of screen killers who approach this sort of character, but the film makers must usually find something in them which makes them seem weird or alien or otherwise deeply disturbed.  In American Psycho, I rather hoped that our killer would be a true mirror of ourselves, not just another psycho freak, easily dismissed as an aberration. A real villain is one who can smile while doing evil, someone who is almost likeable.  A ranting madman is just a ranting madman."

","American Psycho is a remarkable adaptation of Ellis' book.  It would have been SO easy to make this into a slasher flick, or a standard horror flick, or to add some kind of commonplace intrigue, but Mary Harron didn't do that. She managed to maintain the single most powerful emotion of the entire piece -- despair.  The voiceovers delivered by Christian Bale are perfectly in sync with the book.  I was surprised to see Bale delivering a few of the monologues vocally, but you know, such an occurrence while transitioning from book to film isn't a surprise and Bale delivers them with a crazed precision and enthusiasm that I loved.<br/><br/>One of the cornerstones of the book was the incredibly inhuman violence perpetrated by Patrick Bateman and a lot of this is skillfully rendered in the film just offscreen, or suggested in a way that was far more frightening and powerful than just-show-us could have been.  Here's an example. Bateman picks up a pretty blonde woman.  They talk briefly as they walk and the next scene is the next morning.  Bateman's in his office, absent-mindedly fondling a lock of blonde hair, which he quickly stuffs in a pocket as someone comes in.  Certainly Bateman is nuts, of that we are assured when he kills Paul Allen, but we only start to uncover just how totally disconnected he is as the film unfolds.  I refer you to a scene that I call ""Sherbet"". Our first real glimpse at the creature beneath his skin.  But on the gross-o-meter, this would be maybe a three out of ten.  We've tolerated much, much worse and not been THAT offended.<br/><br/>I liked it.  I especially liked that it's showing in the same theaters as American Beauty.  Oh, that just thrills me.

The director Mary Harron balances the satire elements and the horror elements in a entertaining way. The gory violence mostly occurs off screen though it does still have some good gory moments.

I suspected the latter, but am still not sure.  Anyway, the most remarkable part of this film is the performance of Christian Bale.  His character was dark, debonair, menacing, and hilarious at the same time.  Some people have compared him to Jack Nicholson in the shining, but I would say this is more like Rod Serling playing a combination of the Alex character from Clockwork Orange and Jack the Ripper.  This is a great surprise, given his earlier work, and probably will elevate him to superstar status in short order. I can see him as a leading candidate for portraying a number of roles from the next James Bond, to Count Dracula.

WIth that said I can disagree with bad reviews about how this movie is too gory because that is absolutely ridiculous.  The subjest matter calls for it so that is what has to be showed, end of story.<br/><br/>One thing that I got from the film that has not really been addressed on this site is the idea that Bateman kind of symbolizes the way that upper class kind of wields power over the lower classes to the point where they can almost become a real serial killer out of the scope of the police and media.  That is an interesting paradox because it is something that shows up time and time again in the realm of corporate America, which big tobacco and the enron scandal bear witness to.

Willem DeFoe, Jared Leto and Chloe Sevigny also play their roles to a good standard.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint that I have read concerning this great film is that some people think ""The ending sucked coz it was too confusing"". <br/><br/>It was NOT too confusing. I admit that the twist in the end of the movie is perhaps a little more complex than the twists at the ends of 'The Sixth Sense' or 'Fight Club' but come on people, that was the whole friggin point. Bateman is a 'Psycho', in a very big way. But he did NOT kill anyone... Or did he?. That is the point! The story is a narrative as he see's things. He is confused - he does not know if he killed anyone or not therefore we, the viewers, having lived in his mind, do not know either. Dah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Excellent movie, Excellent Score- 9.8 out of 10"

","This review contains spoilers for the following films: American Psycho (well, obviously), Fight Club, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I also ask you to please excuse my primitive spelling, I try to make it up by using over-exuberant vocabulary and syntax.<br/><br/>American Psycho was incredible.  I really do not need to go into how great a satire it is because you probably already know it is.<br/><br/>Let's get the numerical/star grading out of the way right now.  ***1/2 out of **** or 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>What I am here to talk about is how many similarities there are to this and Fight Club.  I felt that Fight Club was one of last year's best pictures, number two on my list, only exeeded by Boys Don't Cry.  American Psycho is the tale of a man who is laughed and and not appreciated by most of his colleagues.  He is called a ""dork"" or something that relates to ""dork"" by many of is superiors and/or co-workers.  When he sees some one that has more than him, he creates a fantasy world where he murders these over-achivers in a very sadistic and depraved manner.  Fight Club is the tale of a man who is leading a very mundane existance, and being look at as a peon by many of the people he is surrounded, even himself.  He creates a fantasy world (that eventually merges into the real world) where he can turn his emotional aggressions into physical ones.  I don't mean to go of on a tangent and end up writing a review for Fight Club.  In a word:  American Psycho acts as a more subtle, toned down Fight Club.<br/><br/>Also, I might add that there is one scene in which the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is being played on a television.  Later in the film a hooker runs around an apartment seeing what seems to be hundreds of dead bodies as the American Psycho chases after her with-- what else-- than a chainsaw. There appears to be a reference to the Chainsaw Massacre, the scene in which one of the brat-teenagers stumbles into a room filled with human remains, while being chased by Leatherface.  The same sort of editing is used in the scene in American Psycho that was used in the Chainsaw Massacre."

","This is one of those films that actually gets better each time you watch it and thats not something I will often say.  I first saw this at the cinema when it first came out and enjoyed it but it wasnt until I watched it again on Box Office that i really started to appreciate it and appreciate is an important word to use when describing this film.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gives a great performance as Patrick Bateman the soave business man who has fantasies of comitting murder on randomn victims.  In my view he doesnt kill a single person but that doesnt matter thats not what this film is about.  Its psycological.  I dont want this to sound obnoxious but if you did not enjoy this film it's because you didnt understand it. Give it another go.  Look for the way Bateman portrays a false image within his vanity and how two faced the business men are to each other.  These men are rich but look at there relationships, money cant buy these men true friends and loyalty.  They all treat each other simply as formalities. They enjoy themselves, dont get me wrong, but its all skin deep.<br/><br/>This film is easily in my top ten favourites of all time and I would really appreciate any e-mails expressing views on this film whether good or bad. I will be happy to discuss it with you.  i could have said a lot more but i don't want to add any spoilers!"

","There seem to be two types of opinions on this movie, comments from those who understand it which are usually very positive, and comments from those who don't understand it, who give it poor reviews. Despite what some people seem to think, this is not a slasher horror movie, nor does it deal with split-realities as one person wrote. It is a satirical and humourous look at the yuppie culture of the 80's, through the eyes of a psychopath.<br/><br/>To explain the film, and those who have not yet seen it should look away now, Patrick Bateman is a yuppie loser who fantasises about being a serial killer, however he does not actually kill anyone. He lives out his fantasies through drawings in a book, and he actually believes he is killing people. The key evidence of this is not only the ending but when Bateman wants to kill people but is unable to do so, as in the case of the guy who has a crush on him and his secretary. When he is actually faced with the prospect of a real murder he is not capable of doing it.<br/><br/>Once this is understood it is far easier to appreciate this movie for the masterpiece that it is, unquestionably one of the top ten movies of all time."

Maybe you'd like to think that it was all in mr. Bateman's imagination (wouldn't that be nice). I would like to think it wasn't, that the movie just shows that Pat Bateman had it all, couldn't stand it, killed and killed some more, and got away with it. And again. And again. And... again. Getting rid of all those egocentric, annoying people he murders his way through the eighties. All of you who didn't understand the movie, expecting a gory horror flick, just go and watch Harry Potter. Maybe you didn't like it, but just stop saying this is a bad movie, because it is not.

"baporter","8","0","0","14 April 2000"," A solid picture with a star-making performance....
","I've been reading a lot about American Psycho for a few days now, and having just seen the movie, I am at a loss as to what all the fuss is about or why this movie seems so divisive.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a pretty solid picture.  It isn't great, and far from the next Silence of the Lambs as some have suggested, but it does have its moments and on the whole is worth the time and money to see.<br/><br/>The main reason to see this picture is for the performance of Christian Bale.  This is a star-making performance if I have ever seen one. Throughout the picture I was reminded of Tom Cruise, especially Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut.  His performance is both funny and disturbing at the same time, a very difficult line to walk.  Some of his scenes, where he is discussing his music while preparing to kill, is brilliant in the way Bale builds the insanity and detachment of his character.  You can see it in his eyes, that this character knows no remorse and that killing to him is not so much a choice as a personality flaw, to put it mildly.<br/><br/>A lot has also been said of the satire this film has of the 80's yuppie lifestyle.  That aspect of the film was one that didn't particularly resonate me.  I thought it was a bit heavy-handed, but the 80s yuppie lifestyle served as a very effective backdrop for the better story of the<br/><br/>hollow shell of a man who kills because he feels he has to.<br/><br/>There are bad parts to this film.  I thought some of the characters were unnecessary and some of the storyline muddled, but at the same time those weaknesses contributed to the haunting feel of the film, the world through a serial killer's eyes, where no human being is likeable or of value and the day to day lifestyle seems almost as insane as a killing spree.  There were times when I wasn't sure what was happening, but I suspect that was true for the character on the screen as well, which is why it worked even when it seemed convoluted.<br/><br/>For all it's flaws, this is a good picture.  And whatever you think of the film, everyone has to admit that they left the theater thinking, and that this film has been on their minds for days after.  While for some that will be seen as a contemptous thing, for me that is the mark of a good film.  I gave it an 8."

","Let's throw in a cliche and say that the book was better then the film. <br/><br/>The book was kind of a 'Bridget Jones Diary' for fruitcakes, and was not only shocking but often really funny.  The movie isn't shocking, since all the violence happens off-screen, and though it has some funny moments (the scene with the namecards!) it just can't surpass the brilliance of the novel. One of the main problems was christian Bale.  Don't get me wrong, he did a good acting job, but I just didn't believe him as Patrick Bateman.  The person I had in mind after reading the book was someone completely different. Another thing that bothers me were the Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoone storylines that both ended up nowhere. American Psycho is like the 80s itself: slick, overdone and also very empty.<br/><br/>Most Memorable Movie Moment: Patrick Bateman discussing the finer points of Huey Lewis while preparing another axe murder.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"
"Bayjohn","8","0","0","2 January 2002"," Great book, but decent movie...
","American Psycho was for Bret Easton Ellis a chance to show the materialistic 80's in a different light.  The shallow lifestyles of the people during this era were perfectly brought to life in his novel and in Mary Harron's film. Patrick Bateman is just another one of those shallow, successful business men that dominated the scene.  However, Patrick had a obsessions and an after hours lifestyle that would sicken and disgust most everyone had they known.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw in the film is it's inability to have the viewer guessing as to whether the horror was real or just imagined.  The novel presents the entire story in such a way that the reader does not know if the actual carnage is real or just part of Patrick Bateman's sick imagination. Although the film does try, it does not succeed.<br/><br/>I do respect Mary Harron's choice of using the ""less is more"" principle when it comes to the violence.  The graphic depictions of violence in the novel would have made the film beyond a horror movie and more like a snuff film. The film is good and is worth viewing for those folks that lived during the exciting 1980's like I did."
"Mitch-38","9","0","0","21 December 2001"," A Perfect Allegory of American Greed & Mentality
","*Caution-Some potential spoilers ahead* Rarely has a motion picture aimed to capture the essence of its subject, and succeed so well. Christian Bale in AMERICAN PYSCHO nails this one to the wall, if you'll pardon the expression.<br/><br/>
The main focus is the opulent, orgiastic greed of the 1980's, although it could be any real place in present time, as well. Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street broker on the verge of going insane. Bateman's world of picture-perfect world of defoliating skin creams and two o'clock tanning appointments; hides the facade of a man who is not there, nothing, except for his continuing spiral into the abyss.<br/><br/>The reality of his world, which really comes down to one-upsmanship among his cronies and his social circle; who don't listen or care about each other, anyway. The nothingness of it grows to the point Bateman cannot return, with hellish consequences for those unfortunate to be in his path.  <br/><br/>
AMERICAN PSYCHO is a well-crafted film, with extremely quirky bits of humor and is well-acted. Highly recommended."
"chrisow","7","0","0","18 December 2001"," Let's sort this out, once and for all
","I have read many comments regarding this film. Like The Shining (1980), people are divided in their opinion of this film. Let's look at the usual comments and deconstruct them:<br/><br/>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br/><br/>1=HOLLOW AND NO PLOT= That's the point of the film! It shows the eighties for what it really was, hollow and flat. If there was a plot, then we would not be able to make sense of this movie, it's more like a diary.<br/><br/>2=UNNECESSARY VIOLENCE= That is the worst thing that one can accuse this film of. The violence was there for two reasons: to distract you from Bateman's boring yuppie life and to show how everybody else is wrapped up in their own lives to notice anything. ie nobody answering the door when Bateman chases the prostitute with chainsaw.<br/><br/>3=NOT ENOUGH BLOOD AND GORE= As I stated in my previous review of this film, this isn't a slasher film. It is an intelligent, and hillarious look at eighties culture. If you want a slasher film, I recommend Friday the 13th movies.<br/><br/>4=WHAT WAS THAT ENDING ABOUT?= The biggest cause for debate. Bateman didn't kill anybody during this film. It was all in his head. He clearly is disturbed, but couldn't carry out a killing to save his life. That's why, almost, all of the killings go unnoticed.<br/><br/>If, after reading this, you are still not convinced, then read the book by Bret Easton Ellis. After reading it, watch the film wit all this in mind."
"MP185","Null","0","0","16 December 2001"," Misunderstood Cult Classic
","People overlooked this film when it was released in 2000 because of the book's bad reputation and the controversy over making a film about such a dark character.  Having read the book all I can say is the film maker's had their work cut out for them.  Bret Easton-Ellis's novel is both disturbing, daring and unforgettable.  And most of the stories described could not be put on film without risking an triple X rating for gore and sexual violence. So rather than go that route, the film makers decided to make ""American Psycho: the movie"" more of a black comedy with clever satire. Unfortunately, most of this humor was misunderstood by the movie public.<br/><br/>
Simply put, ""Psycho"" is a very funny movie.  The lead character, Patrick Bateman takes himself very seriously but is seen as a bit of a bafoon by those around him.  I believe the film version of Ellis's book is meant to be a comedy of errors, albeit very dark in nature.  Every scene has a humorous undercurrent to it.  (WARNING:  SPOILERS ahead) From Bateman's seemingly endless array of skin cleansors to the bizarre sight of him running naked down a corridor carrying a chainsaw), its all meant to be shocking and also one big joke.  During the book you can never tell if Patrick is imagining his psychotic episodes or if they are really happening.  The film makes pretty clear that most of what's happening is part of Bateman's sick fantasy world.  Made clear by the unbelievable sequence where Bateman goes on a shooting spree and somehow evades capture by blowing a cop car.<br/><br/>
I think this movie will pick up popularity in years to come and become a cult film.  The film is indispensible because its one few that dares to make fun of the 80's chronic materialism and gross excess.  All in the while making the ultimate 80's success story, Patrick Bateman look like exactly what he is, ""A big dork."""

I had just re-read the book and that feeling of wanting to see this story was hitting me again.  Then I read something about Leonardo DiCaprio had backed-out of the lead role.  I should have mailed that pretty boy some KleenX.  Relieved to hear this new young to-be-star Christian Bale was going to be our Pat Bateman, I started reading everything I could in anticipation of ""American Psycho"" to hit the screen.  Anyway, the long wait ended this Friday (twice) and again this past Sunday.  The movie exceeded my expectations.  Bale was amazing, along with the rest of the cast (most especially ChloÃ« Sevigny who played ""Jean"").  I could not stop laughing and have been trying to tell everyone that this is a black comedy with a couple of gut-wrenching scenes. The point is that if you do not catch on to that early, you will probably not enjoy the rest of the film.  People got up and left when I saw it for the 3rd time.  Hahahaha.  ""Leave"", I thought.  The greed of the 1980's will never be better portrayed on screen and one will have to search pretty far to find a more unique story.  Though I have been a big fan of the book for a while now, I will take nothing away from the movie, which is one of the rare cases when a good read is also a good view.

The ambiguous ending sheds no light on this particular issue, and I think that was a smart choice for Mary Harron to make--however, I think that this issue is, aside from the misogyny and sex, one of the main reasons that so many people hate this movie.<br/><br/>My take on the issue is this.  We have a main character who is also the narrator of the film, and we see the events in the movie through his eyes (Bateman is in every scene except one).  Okay.  We have to rely on Bateman and his immediate surroundings for all our knowledge about the world he lives in.  The problem here is that Bateman is insane, a point the title alone makes very clear.  So what the viewer is left with is an unreliable narrator, a character whose perception might be off but who wants or needs to tell his story anyway.  Following that theory, the only thing about Bateman that we can really trust in is the fact of his insanity, so *anything* is possible.<br/><br/>I think that all the murders in the film really do happen, with the exception of the shooting spree near the film's end (that one I haven't quite figured out).  Bateman only feels alive when he kills--it is the only real thing in his world--so I believe in his perception of those events. However, just like the consequences of the murders, the ordinary world of work and drugs and parties is nebulous and not so clearly defined.  Those are details that Bateman can skim over because they are Not Important, and nothing is important to Bateman but fulfilling his own homicidal urges.  As the character himself states, there *is* no Patrick Bateman; however, there is a serial killer who is locked in that persona as if it were an Armani straitjacket.  When the killer emerges from this facade, *that* is real--as real as we're ever going to get within the context of the film.  And don't forget, this film is a satire of a cross-section of Eighties culture that was built on materialism, the very essence of false security and surrealistic social values.  The real yuppies for whom Bateman serves as composite would have sold their grandmothers for reservations at Dorsia. How ""realistic"" is that?"

","This movie is just plain stupid.  It is a blaring example of what happens when you try to be an artsy film instead of just plain good.  Symbolism, minimalism, contrast, blah-blah-blah.  This movie could have been set in the backdrop of the 1930's and been bad, 1990's and been bad, and yes, even Ancient Greece and still been an atrocious waste of time.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gave a very effective imitation of Tom Cruise, but ""spectacular"" and all the other strictly wrong adjectives do not apply.<br/><br/>If you liked showgirls, you'll like this movie, but it stinks in a whole new way.<br/><br/>And the ending?

","I'll confess I didn't expect a comedy when I first started watching this movie, but it's too funny not to have been intentional. But the humor is stark and extreme--not in a pathetically disgusting way like American Pie, but rather a minimalist bland way. <br/><br/>Hollywood has been attacking the eighties for years now as a ""decade of greed"" and ""selfish"", even though it was a time of a resurgent economy and a renaissance of American self-confidence. The age of Reagan was like waking up after sleeping off a bad seventies hangover. <br/><br/>But this one is hard to place, it seems as if the makers almost recognize that they're making a parody of the movies that have come before. They take the self-loving yuppie to farther extremes than others have, but it's basically the same story. I'd suggest watching this movie on a triple bill, or in conjunction with ""Wall Street"" and ""Bright Lights, Big City"". The latter, also based on a Bret Easton Ellis book, even has basically the same scene in a stylish dance club with the same New Order song playing, ""True Faith"". But this movie then takes the Charlie Sheen/Michael Fox model and moves him to whole new level: Maniac selfish murderer--who is so filled with loathing that he is losing his mind. <br/><br/>Christian Bale is quite good as an American yuppie, and his not quite there American accent actually adds to Bateman, the main character, as a phony. The blood isn't really even as bad as the book (which was quite controversial among women's groups when it came out, accused of being misogynistic). There's not really much of a plot, besides the gradual disintegration of Bateman, and intensification of the violence. The ending is strangely lacking, though it's hard to describe without giving it away (which others have done in their comments)."

","This movie was tastefully done in a way that was artistic, and did not gross you out with gore, while at the same time conveyed a sense of disgust at this man, Patrick Bateman's, sick personality.  It was brilliantly done, and brilliantly acted.  To be able to portray such a shallow character as Bateman, yet still have the ability to give him depth, shows an ingenious acting ability on Christian Bale's part.  Those who criticize this movie, simply just don't get it.  It's not just about a serial killer, it's more about how when all that matters is status and possessions, nothing really matters.

","After just watching American Psycho I still do not understand what was suppose to be happening.  Throughout the movie we see this man butcher people for very stupid reasons.  (One man had better business cards.) Then, when you think he might have a hint of humanity and is turning himself in to his lawyer, the movie crumbles completely.  I guess the just of the movie is that no matter how well you maintain your body, how high up the ladder you climb, you are not going to be the center of everyone's attention.  I know that the title should have better warned me of this movie.  Yet, I had read reviews praising how powerful the movie was, how excellent the acting of Christian Bale.  I did not find either to be true.  I believe any second rate actor could have fulfilled the requirements for this movie.  Any 'psychotic killer' from a B rated slasher movie would have been just fine and probably cheaper for the budget. I was honestly bothered by this movie, not in the sense that it made me stop and think of how I would compare to this character.  What made me stop and think was the fact that there is someone out there writing this material and they are who worry me."

","American Psycho is a brilliant satire from Master Director Mary Harron. This proves that females are more than able to make great works of art in this medium.

This film wins points in the indy world for it's hard-edged in-your-face filmmaking and dazzling cinematography (by Andrzej Sekula). Not to mention a wonderfully detailed and un-apologetic screenplay from Ms Harron and Gueniviere Turner.

","I enjoyed this movie for the most part and would recommend it to anyone-as long as they are open-minded and not easily offended by the violence and sexual situations. Christian Bale gave an absolutely amazing performance as Patrick Bateman. It is too bad that the Oscar Academy would probably not even consider him to be nominated because of the strong nature of this movie. He added so much variety and depth to the role. His performance will send chills down your spine!! But this movie's nature pales in comparison to the book version, which is much more violent and explicit. I enjoyed watching the 1980's yuppie-scum culture be satirized and put-down in a very clever, sometimes humorous way.<br/><br/>THe only criticism I have is the rampaging scene where Patrick goes berserk in public. Very stupidly staged violence that was also very unrealistic. How could he blow up a police squadron and the officers just by firing a normal-appearing handgun?? I also find it hard to believe that he wouldn't of been found after committing such a violent rampage with such a high body count. Law enforcement in such a large, crime-ridden city would of been combing the area on high alert for him, he wouldn't of been in a restaurant, unfound, the very next day!"

I think that the film allows you to draw several conclusions about Patrick Bateman, right up to the end.  The end is were you are left to decide what is happening with Patrick.  The film was ""in your face"" and quite graphic, but this was absolutely necessary to fully understand Patricks character.  There was nothing about this movie that I didn't like.

","This movie is clearly well directed by its female director but not well enough to counter the terminal obnoxiousness of the lead character. The golden rule about making a movie is that a flawed character needs to have some redeemable or likeable features, to retain our interest. Christial Bale does a sterling performance but who particularly wants to see an unpleasant psycho go through his routines for close to two hours? After a while it seems like the only reason you watch is to see how gross the next murder will be, and that has to be a bad thing to promote."

The movie focuses around the life of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who when he is not cutting up and prostitutes, is instead doing his job on wall-street. American Psycho I thought was pretty different than any other horror, thriller, slasher,. etc. movies. This movie is really all of them put together in one good movie. When you watch this movie you think if these murders that Bateman is commiting are real or just his own imagination, his own fantasy. If they are real you wonder how does he just seem to get away with it. This movie has some impressive acting by both Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe.

Christian Bale does an amazing job of portraying the unraveling madness of Bateman but it is done in a rapid, abbreviated way, apart from the novel.<br/><br/>What's missing are the establishing events like the endless clothing descriptions, the vapid discussions between Patrick and his wall street cronies and, of course, the brutal displays of Bateman's psychotic rage. You get bits and pieces of all of these but not enough to really appreciate the Jekyll and Hyde persona of the Patrick Bateman of the book. The humour aspect of the film is played very well but I missed the relationships of Patrick and his unwitting co-workers, his girlfriend, Evelyn, and his love-struck secretary, Jean. The movie stands pretty well on it's own but I think you lose something if you haven't read the book first.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of showing the absurdness of a high-profile wall street executive who enjoys butchering women and I recommend it but don't expect the shocking portrayal of the book."

","This movie had the potential to be something really great. Perhaps one of the best movies of the year. But something was missing that turned 'American Psycho' into an absolute joke. <br/><br/>I have not read the story and don't intend to after watching the film. They're probably different but I've had enough of the 'American' all together. The plot and direction of the movie seemed good and could have gone somewhere if the studio people hadn't done such a hack job of what they had to work with. <br/><br/>They (writers, producers, directors, actors) screwed this film up in more than one way. The writing was terrible. I thought that it seemed to drift off and go into a different direction than what the story was going into. There were a lot of comments and one-liners put into the script that made no sense whatsoever. The movie's time could have been cut in half and would have covered the same amount of material. <br/><br/>The acting was good in some parts. Now this was the first time that I had seen Christian Bale in anything before. His acting was tolerable but nothing special. The smartest thing that this film had was a lesser known actor in the lead role. Even though the setting and story called for a strange and unusual man to play the part of Patrick Bateman, the character's speech and actions were to dull and slow for the movie. I disliked the film for another reason pertaining to the actors and characters. Bale was the only real person who had an input into the movie. He delivered almost all of the lines and was in almost every scene. The film showed a number of business buddies to the killer but none of them really had anything to do with the film except for the character of Paul Allen played by Jared Leto. This role was messed up from the very beginning. We were introduced to him but really never learned anything about him. Before you know it he's dead and we're left listening to Phil Collins is it? <br/><br/>Before I saw this film, I pictured it as one with a lot of killings. After all, it is titled 'American Psycho'. Wrong. We were shown very little as to how the bodies pile up. A murder here and maybe another one to come but there was just nothing to it. <br/><br/>Once nearing the end, I thought that the film would take a turn for the better and would end up being a huge surprise. Wrong again. It ended at the drop of a hat and never really explained what happened to the main character. A lot of questions were never answered and this was probably the worst part of the film. (Like there were any good ones?)<br/><br/>I must say that I was surprised as to how I reacted to the film. I pictured a really interesting, scary movie but it was nothing more than a good story line trying to break through an awful script. This seems to be the trend nowadays. Hollywood just keeps destroying possibly terrific movies.<br/><br/>
'American Psycho' was just too slow for my liking. The beginning started off slow, the middle ran dry and the end was a total disappointment. The previews that I had seen showed an entirely different movie than what I actually saw. It wasn't a good one. Avoid this movie and try a real horror."

It's the not one of the best films you'll ever see, or as one would say (look below), a new low, but rather a genuine experience that feels good and feels right. It appeals to me very much in the way that ""The Ice Storm"" does.<br/><br/>One of the things you'll notice is the great acting by Christian Bale. He's terrific -- and he fits the character. The yuppie style is all him. He lives it, breathes it, sleeps it. He always (as it seems like) listens to some popular 80's band/artist whenever he wants, and that's most of the time (this film is in 1987).<br/><br/>I liked this movie because of how well the frustrations were thought out in the yuppie lifestyle of the 1980's. There's not much blood, really, because frankly, it doesn't matter. It isn't a slasher film.

And that's the stunning beauty of it all. AP is so deep its shallow and vice versa.<br/><br/>Christian Bale (in a trying-way-too-hard American accent) does a top-notch job playing Patrick Bateman, a rich New York Wall-Streeter who lives an utterly empty life. His fiance (the always excellent Reese Witherspoon)is a drip, his friends are drones, and even the people he passes on the street seem to be pathetic, soulless creatures.<br/><br/>Finally, we see that Patrick DOES find a way of escaping all of this 80s nonsense...through random acts of hideous violence. The first shocking killing, involving a homeless man and (gasp!) his dog, jolts the audience with its intensity..and humor. Patrick's murders (while not that graphic) make you squeemish because the director has done such a superb job of making them FUNNY. You're laughing as people are chased with axes, nail guns, chainsaws, etc. This is BLACK COMEDY at its finest. You hate yourself for loving every delicious moment of mayhem.<br/><br/>The overall point to the story is that in the world of excess, a heavy price of being ""not there"" comes along with all of the wonderful restaurant reservations and business cards with gold lettering. Some may say the meaning is shallow and overplayed, but I truly think the filmmakers accomplish what they set out to do...show that everyone has to find their identity somehow...and hopefully it won't be in the psychotic ways that Bateman does.<br/><br/>One final note...unlike the similar in message Fight Club, this one's twist ending is NOT a total betrayal to the entire movie.

","Spoilers are contained in this review, FYI. I would say American Psycho had bits of existentialism, self-exploration, and an interesting mix of psychology. It is about an off-centered fellow named Patrick Bateman who, on almost all levels, is the same as you and me, except that he is incredibly articulate in his talk and his thought process, yet acts on his innermost feelings without any type of ""filter"", i.e. if he gets mad at you, he'll just kill you. He doesn't seem capable of empathy, yet there is a scene in which he breaks down and confesses his murders, and the ""child"" within him is brought to the surface. The movie hints at many things but never brings each one to fruition: the relationship between his secretary and how she serves as some moral ""signpost"" in some ways; how he would say one thing such as ""Im into murders and executions"" but people would think he said ""Mergers and acquisitions"" (possibly some kind of people are self-centered theme/only hear what they want to hear?); and the ending with Reagan on TV (minor political commentary/ more largely the story being a metaphor on ethics).<br/><br/>This movie reminds me much of Sartre's ""The Stranger"", and a little bit of Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"", both of which have to do with identity, ethics, and communication. In the end of American Psycho, Bateman reaches out, but no one hears, or wants to hear; his conclusion is that it never mattered much in the first place.

I feel at a disadvantage, because the book would obviously offer more insight into the mind of Patrick Bateman. However, this is the impression that I received from the movie.<br/><br/>I found that the plot and dialogue was very rich in satire and irony. I saw the movie a certain way through most of the film, finding my self sympathetic toward the character of Bateman. And then, suddenly, the viewpoint changes, and I felt as if I had been completely led astray to consider the actual content of the plot.<br/><br/>Most people find that the book/film is a comment on our society. I had a different impression. Watching this movie made me consider its face value in depth: a tale of a psychopath, trying to control urges and emotions of greed and disgust because they aren't socially acceptable. Bateman is worried to death about not being assimilated into a society that condemns the kind of person that he is. His murders are fabrications of his mind and a devious plan that can never come to fruition because it will prevent him from living life as a ""normal"" human being. Bateman's internal battle is brought to life majestically on screen. The movie does not go for shock value along the lines of gore and scenes that make the audience shield their eyes in disgust. This works well because the point of the story is reinforced, refusing to be buried under clichÃ©s, and is portrayed by scenes of sadistic humour and strong foreshadowing.<br/><br/>Great job by all actors concerned, Christian Bale in particular. 8/10"

As a serial killer flick, this one doesn't work especially well (did Bateman even really commit the murders?), however as a period piece of the 1980's it succeeds admirably creating a twisted world that drives Bateman to the homicidal edge. Everything about this movie is very impressive, from the cast of lesser knowns, who give it their all, to the story, constantly shifting, and throwing the audience a curve ball.

"splissken","Null","0","0","26 April 2001"," Better the second time around
","I first read this book back in 1991 when Rolling Stone printed on article talking about how controversial the book was.  At the time I was studying psychology with an emphasis on criminal behavior including serial killers. I enjoyed the book because I thought it lended a lot of authenticity to the character of Bateman by describing his morning rituals of grooming, the products he bought, how much he spent, where he got them, etc..  The only dissappointment from the book came from the fact I didn't think that his background was explained enough.  Most killers follow some kind of behavior patterns growing up that lead to the acts they commit.  But this isn't supposed to be about the book, so let me switch gears.<br/><br/>I remember screaming in terror when I heard Leonardo would be playing the role of Patrick Bateman, something I am very thankful did not happen.  The first time I saw the movie, I knew there was no way the film could depict some of the more grisly acts of the book or it would never make it to the theaters.  With that in mind, I watched the movie and was very let down by the lack of any character depth the book spent so much time on dealing with present day Patrick Bateman.  However, I caught the film again last night when a friend of mine stopped by and I noticed a different message being presented in the movie.  The book focused on Bateman, his materialism, and lack of any compassion for his fellow man.  What I noticed in the movie was the lack of compassion shown by anyone.  Every single character (with the exception of his secretary maybe) was so wrapped up in themselves an their lives that they never noticed what was going on around them.  Notice how many times he is obviously confessing his deeds or even hinting at them (like when he doodles a horrific scene of a woman with a chainsaw in her on a tablecloth while dining with his girlfriend - she never notices), no one even really hears what he says.  There is also the scene where Bateman chases the prostitute through a hallway at night with a chainsaw.  She is screaming, pounding on doors, yet no one bothers to check it out.   I think the film wasn't trying to show a journey through one man's psychotic behavior, but maybe that we have been so wrapped up in ourselves for so long, it's no wonder guys can get away with this and no one notices. Watching it in this light really made the film a lot more compelling.  Not the greatest movie you can see, but very well worth the time."

","Please note, spoilers follow.<br/><br/>I am bemused reading through many of these reviews: not one person has stated succinctly that Patrick Bateman is NOT A SERIAL KILLER. Psychopathic or ""psycho"" he may or may not be; the definition of that term has become ambiguous due to massive pop usage.  But during this film he does not murder a soul.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I was absorbed though not decisively impressed.  Fairly well-acted, I thought, though irritatingly plastic and shallow in most spots.  And prettily done: sharp lines, chiseled physiques, alluring dishes at various chic minimalist restaurants.  But surely there must be a point; what can it be?  The movie is clearly not about psychopaths and their mentality, it is about the 80's and superficiality.  Then by what many reviewers have called ""a true cop-out of an ending"" or ""the weakest ending imaginable"", the movie was validated for me.  Bateman had in fact not committed any of the murders so mechanically and attractively (if I'm not psycho myself for using that adverb) portrayed in the film.  Bateman was, though mentally disturbed for certain and delusional of course, simply too lame to follow through with the murders he passionately imagined.<br/><br/>
Others have cited his ""inability to receive recognition"" for his crimes. No, that's not it!  He didn't commit the crimes, don't you see?  They were fantasies.  They were cherished illusions, delusions, dreams, whatever you want to call them.  It's pretty clear, though debatable, that he believed in them all the while, which marks him as a clear mental case.  But Patrick was an unreliable narrator, and we were fools to assume that his visions coincided with whatever objective reality the director was putting forth. Specifics?  Well, beyond the fact that the police didn't nab him easily after his last shooting spree, there are the facts that the attorney had seen Paul Allen in London (this could be chalked up to the recognition gimmick, but not correctly, I don't think), and his visit to Allen's old apartment, barren of carcasses, blood, or crime-scene effects.<br/><br/>Given the fact that the crimes were just dreams, this movie makes a great deal more sense to me.  Bateman's character epitomizes his crowd: weak, empty, shallow, void of all human qualities.  He is too weak and empty to affect others' lives in any true fashion, and this includes affecting their deaths.  He's the lamest of the lame.  And THAT'S the point of American Psycho -- not a brilliantly original point, but neither a senseless parade of misogyny and murder."

","If you haven't read the book and you've watched the movie, chances are you didn't appreciate the movie as much as it should be.  I'm not saying it's good, or bad, I'm just saying that there are alot of things that you miss out on understanding if you haven't read the book.  Just like the book, the atmosphere of intensity in certain situations is amplified to a drastically hopeless decibal.  The most interesting scene is the shooting rampage towards the end.  This movie is not really a horror movie, or even a thriller, in a way it is a satire.  The author Brett Easton Ellis satires just about everything.  The ending to this movie is played off of a certain interpretation of the book, though you probably got the ending in the movie it is much more difficult to understand the ending of the book.  In the book it is left very vague, like shakespeares play Hamlet, it's left open to a dozen philosophies.  It's up to you which one you choose.  Christian Bale was perfect for the role he was in, it was very specified in the book that Patrick Bateman is supposed to be a handsome, classy character who reads the Gentleman's Quarterly (GQ) on a very regular basis.  Patrick Bateman was believable as that figure.  One thing I must specify on, In the wicked magazine some guy left a comment saying that Christian Bale was no good for the role, he was too soft looking.  Well, that was the whole point, Patrick Bateman is not like Joe Spinnell in Maniac, though some of his actions are similar.  Patrick Bateman is everything you look for in a guy, extremely wealthy, ambitious, intelligent, polished, tasteful, good looking, etc. He is not someone who you develop fear for, and that's the irony, because underneath all that he is an all American psycho!"

","I first saw American Psycho last spring, but it was not until last week that I finally read the book.  I just rewatched the film last night.  I was told to read the book because it made the film make more sense and after reading I have to say that it was one of the best novels that I have ever read.  The film just seems to take chunks or scenes from the book and leaves with little to no context within the film.  I think that the film turned out to be more of a slasher/detective film than a smart social commentary on yuppies in the 80s.        Christian Bale captures the essence of Patrick Bateman, but Director Mary Harron does not do his character justice.  She does not allow the audience the opportunity to attach themselves to this character as Bret Easton Ellis does in the book.  I think that the film would have benefitted from more voiceover narration.  You need to like Bateman more to understand the pain he feels from the world in which he lives.  Harron does nothing but make us a fear a very scary but sexy man. Also, there was not enough emphasis placed upon the lifestyle of these wall streeters.  I need more on fashion, gossip, and cocaine.  With today's influx of movies on drugs there should have more drug use in this film, especially with all of the coke they all used in the novel.   <br/><br/>       I would love to remake this film using more from the film and placing more emphasis on Bateman's world not his reality of being a murderer.  I would also like to have seen what Leonardo DiCaprio, who was originally supposed to play Bateman, would have done with this role."

True, it was well-directed and superbly-acted, but overall it was flat, boring, and only had a few scenes that were enjoyable to watch. Everything else in the film was really silly, including Bateman describing to us what he showers with and how he puts all this face wash junk on his face, and there are always the long, boring scenes of Bateman with his snobby friends. This was really dull overall. Reese Witherspoon was good but should've been in the film more.

I thought it would be part of the `I Still Know What Mrs. Tingle Did With Your Idle Hands Last Friday the 13th' routine, but this individual and occasionally stunning feature is a real horror film for a real adult audience.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a respected Wall Street businessman by day.

The film has a lot of laugh-out-loud funny moments, but if you're expecting a horror-thriller type, you won't be disappointed. There is no shortage of shocks; one immediately scary part is where Bateman chases his regular prostitute around a hotel room with a terrifying chainsaw sound.

","From the clever title sequence until the disarming but rather ambiguous climax, ""American Psycho"" is compelling entertainment. While entertainment hardly seems to be the appropriate word for a film that delves into the mind of a psychopath, its as fitting as one of the lead character's designer suits. Patrick Bateman is the film's antihero- a power hungry, woman hating, coke sniffing, hardcore porn enthusiast and Phil Collins fan. As well as a serial killer. With these less than admirable qualities, why is Bateman so damn likeable? Because he's been brought to life by Christian Bale, a Brit actor sporting a flawless American accent, infinite expressions, great comedic timing, and a six pack. Bale, best known as the little boy in Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun,"" but also very good in 1998's ""Velvet Goldmine"", is a star waiting to be born. No obvious comparison to another actor springs to mind. That's what makes him so interesting, and his performance so unpredictable.  While Bale alone is enough to carry the movie, he's also surrounded by a stellar supporting cast, some who appear briefly, but to good effect. Willem Dafoe (watch out for him in the upcoming ""Shadow of the Vampire"") has a lot of fun as the detective questioning Bateman, who may or may not be one step ahead of him. Reese Witherspoon (whose lower half is mostly kept out of frame due to her pregnancy), as Bateman's bitchy fiancee, is very good as always, and has her best moment when she breaks down late in the picture, realizing her beloved Patrick is ""inhuman."" In the role of Bateman's mousy secretary, Chloe Sevigny is perfect. She has this quiet intensity about her, and if she hadn't been played as so sensitive, or looked as delicate, there would hardly be the sense of dread that there is when Bateman lines up his industrial strength nailgun to the back of her head. All these performances cannot be praised without acknowledging the director, Mary Harron, who very well could have channeled Stanley Kubrick before stepping behind the camera. The visuals are striking without being in your face, the editing is seamless, and the violence is never used for cheap shock value. Most importantly, the audience is not manipulated by a twist ending for the sake of a surprise, but is given a carefully calculated finale that has had quite some build up, which will leave you thinking for days afterward... like all great movies."

","[possible minor spoilers]<br/><br/>
American Psycho brilliantly distinguishes itself from many other immature, horror hack-n-slash flicks that have plagued the decade.  The tone of the movie is quite calm, giving the movie an adult, deeper level of atmosphere. The movie is in first person narrative, quite an odd, yet refreshing view of a serial killer and his motives and thoughts.  From the first moments, the audience is led into the very personal life of Bateman, our psycho.  His rigorous personal lifestyle and painfully sequenced daily procedures speak of a different incarnation than the cleancut facade of a wall streeter. Darker deeds and reflections surface as the movie proceeds.<br/><br/>The dreamlike atmosphere is greatly heightened by Bateman's numerous, intimate appraisals of music and the correspondingly cold, logical analysises of its chronology.  Bateman speaks like a professor.  His words are ever calm, and flows outward without hesitation or barriers.  Such relaxed and intelligent demeanor is hardly what one would expect in a psycho, yet this is Bateman's greatest triumph, his double life.<br/><br/>As all the events are set in motion, the movie rolls faster and faster toward the end.  Bateman eventually loses control of his tenuous sanity and goes postal.  Then the ending comes and, after seeing half the credits roll off the screen, you realize what really happened, and then begin to comprehend the bitter-sweet anticlimax.<br/><br/>Well worth the time and price."

","Having started reading the novel ""American Psycho"" by Bret Easton Ellis and given up, I decided to let the wonder that is cinema finish the story for me. Having seen the film, I've now re-started the book.<br/><br/>This film, although slightly ambiguous at times, was a real surprise. Christian Bale was excellent as the Patrick Bateman, the fictitious Wall Street killer from the book. Mary Harron wisely decided not to show the graphic crimes described in the book, instead opting to suggest acts have taken place and leave the details up to the imagination of the viewer. This is a far more effective method of telling the story and avoiding controversy, imaging how this film would've turned out if Paul Verhoeven or someone similar had directed.<br/><br/>Despite the rather grim subject matter, there is plenty of black humor in this film - Patrick Bateman asking a hooker if she takes a credit card - for example.<br/><br/>The music and visual style of the film are good, there are plenty of tracks from the eighties, we're also treated to some highly amusing views on the music of the era from Bateman.<br/><br/>This film is very enjoyable and, although the ending will not satisfy everyone, it is well worth watching.<br/><br/>9/10"

","A powerful attack on mid-80s Wall Street culture, anchored by an Oscar-caliber performance by Christian Bale and smart direction by Mary Harron.  American Psycho is the story of Patrick Bateman, a vain and wealthy yuppie whose main interests are vapid pop music and murder. Bateman stands out in a cinemascape overflowing with serial killers: his blankness is more disturbing than any psychotic rant.  Bale's portrayal constantly involves and surprises us, able to move effortlessly between coked-up goofiness and cruel violence.<br/><br/>  This film should have made much more money, and for those normally put off by horror films the violence and gore are brief: the real focus here is on Bateman, and the society that nurtures him.  This character is truly frightening and plausible. For a hard, intelligent look at the modern world's corruption of the American dream you couldn't do better than a double-bill of this film and Fight Club."

","Patrick Bateman is a Wall Street yuppie who has a nice apartment, nice clothes, healthy body, a beautiful girlfriend, and a great paying executive job.  However, all is not normal for Patrick, you see, beneath those high quality assests, there's a monster that lives deep in Patrick's soul.  That monster is vicious and evil, it's the evil side that controls Patrick when he's upset and angry.  And then all hell breaks loose, blood is shed, and Patrick continues with his daily life. That is the premise behind the new Mary Harron film, AMERICAN PSYCHO. Patrick (Christian Bale) A everyday man, who is indeed successful, wealthy, and part of the elite society in the late 1980's.  But he releases his anger by taking care of his problems, which would include disembody a woman's head, chop a fellow co-worker into little pieces, and other horrific things.       PSYCHO is a intelligent satire of the late 1980's, where we were serious about the lifestyle, songs, and attitude that is protrayed in the film back in 1987.  Now we just laugh and are in disbelief on the way we acted and the music we listened to.  PSYCHO shows the strong conservative image that most Americans were living during Regan's power.  But it's the brilliant inside look at what one of these conservative's would be like if we took a look inside their life.      I was really looking forward to PSYCHO, I was hoping that it would be like a look inside the mind of a madman like Hannibal Lecter, or Travis Bickle.  But it's different, it doesn't really tell the viewer why Patrick kills.  Instead, it shows Patrick's daily life-style, which includes putting on tons of different beauty oils, excersising regularly, and tanning. But it shows that the psychos in our world are not the kind that live in the dark in urban American and have special kinds of moths with a skull on it.  No, it shows that the serial killer is not only the person that you know, but your best friend! The acting by Christian Bale is outstanding, he did quite a job by dropping his Limey accent for a pure Yank accent.  I love his speeches on certain 80's music, including Hewey Lewis, Phill Collins, and Whitney Houston.  The support is also good, Willem Dafoe is also good as a investigator looking for a missing person that Patrick might have killed.  Chloe Sevigny is also very good as the Patrick's administrative assistant who has a crush on Patrick.  And Reese Witherspoon is a typical snobby and stuck-up socialite who cares more about what will the wedding look like than the actual marriage. Mary Harron does a great job adapting the horrific novel (although I haven't read it yet), but with the story and pacing, it appears that she got the real reason to why we should watch this movie.  What I also enjoyed is the trickery that Harron uses in this film.  When the viewer thinks that they are seeing something, it's something totally different.  I always love it when a film director messes with the viewer's mind. Overall, I really did enjoy AMERICAN PSYCHO, but it does have it's bad points.  At times the movie goes from a fast pace to a bit slower.  And some of the character's are not explained fully in detail.  But those are just the side dishes compare to the rest of the film. But when you have a film where you have businessmen compare business card's to show their masculinity, it's sad but funny.  It's just a cruel way to show that while others care about their appearence, others are releasing their anger and taking out on others, with their blood.  This film is not really for the faint of heart.  It's not that gross, but it does leave a lot to the imagination, which is more gross. **** (out of five)"

"repulsion","Null","0","0","17 December 2000"," Mary Harron one-ups Bret Easton Ellis
","Patrick Bateman, the yuppie serial killer du jour created by Bret Easton Ellis, is obsessed with all things superficial. Ellis' written world is full of super-attractive young men with secret killer ways. He wallows in his protagonist's masochistic behavior and only occasionally manages to step back and comment on his behavior on a larger scale. Patrick Bateman is intended to be the metaphor for Reaganism on the kill but somehow this message is muddled amidst the non-stop name-dropping and unending detail that Ellis gives to Bateman's ritualistic killings. <br/><br/>Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) one-ups Ellis in just about every department with her screen adaptation. The fact that many designers did not grant Harron the permission to use their names in the film could have been a Godsend because it forces Harron to focus on the more relevant nuances of her character. Harron brilliantly establishes Bateman's attraction for all things narcissistic in a scene where he describes his daily facial rejuvenating process while standing in front of his bathroom mirror. If you combine that moment with Bateman's non-stop exercise regime and his desire to dine at the fanciest of restaurants, you have a Bateman that is concerned with nothing more than his own beautification.<br/><br/>The infamous threesome scene that slapped the film with an NC-17 rating is a great one because it shows Bateman, played with astonishing madness by Christian Bale, completely detached from the act of sex. Much like Ellis' portrait of Bateman, he is a man more concerned with performance than with the actual act of sex. While having sex with the women he looks at himself in the mirror. He is making love to himself, enjoying his muscular body as it masochistically berates the women.<br/><br/>Although Patrick Bateman is a completely loathsome soul, Harron appropriately adds a certain human element to her psycho killer. Even though Bateman admits over voice-over that he is devoid of any emotion there is a scene in the movie where we get a sense that he is seeking some sort of salvation from the world he has created for himself. After bringing his secretary (Chloe Sevigny) to his apartment, he has her leave after telling her that if she doesn't he might do something horrible to her.<br/><br/>Bateman's sadistic ways are certainly a product of some twisted childhood or adult experiences but Harron does not choose to focus on this. There is a tongue-in-cheek moment where Bateman apologizes to a dinner-date for being late by saying that he is a `product of divorce' but this is about the only glimpse we get into the character's pre-killer days. It's as if Harron is flippantly teasing us with the comment, knowing that we are itching for some sort of Freudian psychoanalysis of her character. <br/><br/>The gore is at a significantly lesser scale than one would be expected considering source material. Aside from one astonishingly executed sequence where a prostitute (Cara Seymour) flees from Patrick down some stairs, the killings in the film are handled in a comedic, albeit disturbing, way. The women in the film do not get much characterization but this is an appropriate thing when you consider that the film is shot through Bateman's eyes, a man that is little concerned with the motivations of his victims.<br/><br/>There is a moment at the end of Psycho's wonderful finale where the characters are watching a presidential address by Reagan. They blankly comment on the program and we basically learn that their lives will continue as is. I wish there were more of these moments because so much of Psycho's substance lies in the way that these men are seen as products of the society that was created under Reagan's America. Bateman's soul is one that is consumed by greed and it seems that he has been given a second chance by film's end. Whether he will take this exit or continue this masquerade is open to interpretation and perhaps dependent on whatever political shift should sway the nation."

","Mary Harron's intelligent adaptation is much funnier than Brett Easton Ellis' controversial novel, and manages to capture the essential ambience of the book without relying on gross-out schlock horror tactics. The ultra-violence is completely toned down in favour of a more subtle approach, and the most effective scenes are frequently not the ones featuring Patrick Bateman's nocturnal chainsaw frenzies, but instead those concerned with the banal, superficial world of designer-obsessive, over competitive uber-execs working on Wall Street in the 1980s. <br/><br/>In this respect it's something of a period piece, employing 80s trappings such as absurdly chunky mobile phones, decidedly suspect hairstyles and Hugo Boss power suits.The ability to secure a reservation at the latest exclusive restaurant is the benchmark by which these characters are judged. Essentially it's as much a satire on the materialistic ethos of the decade as it is a study of terminal psychological disintegration.<br/><br/>
Christian Bale, in what might be a career-defining role, carries the whole movie - but that's not to detract from the extremely witty script which recreates some of the book's seminal scenes to great effect. It's a tribute to his strong central performance that despite Bateman's glaring character flaws (vanity, self-obsession, a penchant for slaying innocent people with nail guns) he actually succeeds in making him quite sympathetic. He even attempts to warn people about his psychopathic tendancies, but these random pleas for help go totally unheard by the hip disaffected Manhattenites he's forced to hang out with. <br/><br/>Trapped in a nightmarishly amoral world, and devoid of any recognisable human emotions other than anger and disgust, Bateman ultimately comes across as the biggest victim of them all. Even when he openly admits to his multiple crimes, his yuppie contemporaries refuse to accept the confession, because mass-murder just isn't the done thing. There's even the hint of a conspiracy of silence, a suggestion that somebody might be covertly covering up the evidence of his deranged activities. <br/><br/>There are also some great supporting roles, notably from Chloe Seveigny as his doting secretary and Willem Dafoe as the cop who is aware of Bateman's guilt but doesn't seem that concerned with stopping him.<br/><br/>
Like the book, the film has no satisfactory resolution, and the audience is left with the impression that Bateman is still out there, drilling holes in prostitutes heads, waiting in vain for someone to catch him. Considering the problematic pre-production period, this film has triumphantly emerged from development hell to give moviegoers a serious slice of the very blackest humour. And thankfully, no Leo Dicaprio to spoil the fun...."

This movie was generally a good adaption of the book. The book is really revolting, I had to stop reading at parts and go do something else before I could continue (and I consider myself a pretty sick guy). You really couldn't sit through the movie if it portrayed what was shown in the book. The closest movie I've seen to something like that was ""Salo: 120 days of Sodom"", which didn't even come close to the violence in American Psycho (the novel). The only problem with the movie's adaption is that it left out some very telling things - like the fact that Bateman's mother is in a mental hospital, and the episode where he murders an ex-gf, which further sketches out his hostility towards women."

","American Psycho<br/><br/>Loved it.  Anyone seeking a traditional horror movie on par with Urban Legends, Scream and movies of that kind will likely be disappointed with this film.  This movie fits into a category best described as psychological horror perfected with a black comedy garnish.  It presents the deterioration of main character Patrick Bateman's (played by Christian Bale) sanity; and his descent from a thread-bare lifeline to the real world.  Summing: It's bloody good.<br/><br/>The film is littered with clues about what is really happening on-screen. The viewer has to watch/listen carefully indeed to catch it all.  The story is expertly told by Director Mary Harron, based Bret Easton-Ellis' book. She unveils evidence of what is really going on in measured doses, but I did not fully `get it' until the end.  I will be eagerly awaiting Mary's next production based on this work.<br/><br/>It is a film for the '90s, dealing with and cleaning up possible consequences from the unstable mind after the decadent 80s on Wall Street. On its face, it is a brutal tale in what might slide into a Slasher Genre. But (as with American Beauty) LOOK CLOSER!  The critical question: `Have you ever let your mind wander about how you might resolve an adversarial situation if there was no possibility of getting caught?'  Magnify those `mind meanderings' by a factor of 100 to reflect slipping from sanity.  This movie's premise explores that avenue completely.  It is handled in a creative, entertaining way for horror fans.<br/><br/>The double entendre dialogue was the most enjoyable part for me.  Normally reserved for comedy, it is used as an effective device in this throughout. Listen carefully to what Patrick Bateman says, and to how it is answered by an opposing character on-screen.  The clues regarding what is actually happening on-screenare everywhere.  But stay alert.  Miss nothing.  Good advice.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Willem Dafoe portray thoroughly believable characters. And Chloe Sevigny - always the consummate actress - executes an extraordinary submissive administrative assistant role as Jean.  (She has been a favorite of mind ever since the movie Kids.)<br/><br/>It will never dethrone a mainstream, horror classic like Hitchcock's Psycho, but this film will find its niche with devotees of the psychological horror thriller.  My recommendation is to see this film not once - but (at least) twice.  PS:  Not the world's best `Date Movie,' by the way, unless two horror fans are on the prowl for interesting fare.  Enjoy."

So the next day I go to the theater and I'm in! As I saw the films I am overwhelmed by the beautiful imagery, style, characters, and so forth. Overall, I was very satisfied. My only complaint was the ending.<br/><br/>The idea of a man killing women in order to maintain a sense of sanity does sound a bit repulsive. Of course feminist groups will protest against this movie but there is a lot of missing information. The character Patrick Bateman doesn't only kill women; he kills men as well. He uses women as meat for sexual pleasures. Once he's done using them he eventually kills them. As for the men, he simply kills them out of jealousy. One thing about Patrick Bateman is that he hates people being more successful than him. So he strives to be superior to everyone. How so? By killing people. Even though some killings of his are rather illogical, some actually do make some serious points. His monologues before he kills his victims will help you decide whether or not his killings carry any sense of logic in them. Still, everything Bateman does has certain intelligence to it.<br/><br/>
The ending was a bit of a let down. It seems that recent films tend to strive for the psychological ending, which I love. Fight Club had it; Stir of Echoes had it, the Sixth Sense, and now American Psycho. But American Psycho's lacked something. I am still not sure I understand the ending yet. I could have been that Bateman was actually insane and had to kill everyone to be at ease, or if his killings were all a state of mind- meaning he imagined and believed in them so much he thought they were real. Something that might have improved the film is if we could have seen what Bateman's secretary does after she sees his daily planner. <br/><br/>Chris Bale has simply come a long way from being the kid in Empire from the Sun. His role back then was Oscar worthy, and it's even more apparent that he deserves recognition for his role as an insane-psychopathic Yuppie from the 80s. <br/><br/>Overall the film is simply brilliant. It is a smart film and it is extremely well made. I'm just happy to see that an independent film such as this captivated the interest of many Hollywood mainstreamers. If anything we need more independent movies to get a wider audience. So far this is the best film I've seen so far this year due to a flawless performance by Bale, and the help of great direction. Lets hope it gains the recognition it deserves."

","Everyone seems to interpret the ending as ""everything only happened in his head"", as in the Hollywood-twist-end-cliche. But that's not the only possible interpretation. Isn't it much simpler to think that the lawyer made a mistake? All along the movie the characters mixed people's names, they thought they were talking with someone else...The point is that no one cares who is who and it doesn't really matters, because they are all the same. So my interpretation of the movie is that the crimes were real, that Paul Allen was killed by Bateman and the lawyer was wrong.<br/><br/>Of course all the movie has a fantastic, unrealistic mood, but if we interpret every unrealistic story as only a character's dream, all the works of artist as Terry Gilliam, Tim Burton, the Cohen Brothers or David Lynch would be ""only a dream""...."

","Sadist, nihilist, narcissist Patrick Bateman satisfies his craving for bloodlust on the big screen adaptation of Brett Easton Ellis' highly controversial bestseller. In contrast to the novel, American Psycho's cinematic counterpart is much less focussed on the details of psychotic murders and personal turmoil. The movie spins around the startling maze of self-obsessed, materialistic, shallow yuppies, which indirectly allow Bateman to commit his crimes. It's a downright accusation of corrupt corporate culture and mindless consumerism.<br/><br/>Director Mary Harron cleverly cut out most of the killing sprees from the book. Violence is still dominant, but rather than a straightforward blood-drenched thriller, the movie turns into a pitch-black comedy by shifting its focus to childlike obsession for petty details, such as business card font sizes. This narrative shift turns out all the better for understanding character depth and corrupt culture.<br/><br/>The movie cleverly plays with audience expectations. The excellent and surprising opening sequence is just one of the many examples. Soon after, Patrick Bateman introduces himself, by telling us in voice over about his workout, beauty and fashion regime. Obviously, his beauty is only skin deep, but his self-imposed, nazi-type regiment does turn him into a physically beautiful ""Ubermensch"". Christian Bale's acting is genuine - he is Patrick Bateman. SPOILER ALERT The movie seems to drown in shallowness when Bateman's colleagues and girlfriends are introduced. But parallel to his insecure, big-mouthed, sexist and utterly boring life of a Wall Street geek by day run the devious excursions of a murderous freak by night. When killing, Bateman turns from kitchen knives to chainsaws. Slowly and steadily we enter the mind of a psychotic, empty shell with the extreme need to be different to others.<br/><br/>Ideally, you've read the book before watching the movie. American Psycho does require a fair bit of reading between the lines to understand the underlying message. If you just want to satisfy your cravings for bloody thrillers, you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>This movie bears a resemblance to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. All three combine violence with humour and pop culture. American Psycho does make you laugh at times, but its underlying message is much more disturbing, since this culture might resemble the one you're all too familiar with."

The population of New York begins to thin out until only Patrick and his targets remain.  Women begin to act like the clueless screamer's they're portrayed as in the horror movies that Patrick watches.<br/><br/>And then Patrick's world falls apart entirely.  He goes through an eerily empty city, shooting everyone he sees, and walks away without a scratch. The next morning, the detective on his trail has mysteriously vanished, Paul is safely alive in London, and not even Patrick's lawyer is willing to buy that Bateman is a murdering lunatic.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>Is this a movie about one man's decent into self-gratification and vicarious thrills through some really disturbing fantasy? Or a morality play about the lengths people can be driven to when they stop caring?<br/><br/>I dunno.  I'd probably have to watch it twice.

","Bale plays ""Patrick Bateman"", an upbeat all-with-it corporate business man working in Wall Street in the mid late 80's.  Being the son of the companies owner, he is pretty much in a cushy position, high paid, surrounded by other yuppies, goes to upscale restaurants, spends time in his high scale Manhattan apartments, and shmoozes with all his other same yuppie friends.  The only difference between him and all the others, is that Patrick is a serial killer.<br/><br/>There's one thing I can say about villains in movies, we all secretly want them to win.  Bale in the yuppie peak of the 80's is surrounded by fakes, and jerkoffs, and other sick kind, so Bale fits right in.  Since he is a serial killer, he has no emotions NONE, and he blends in so easily with all his normal yuppie compatriots.  This is what makes this film unique, in that it's more of a statement on what the era was like than on Bale's horrible obsessions.<br/><br/>Bale's acting is amazing in this role, playing such a complicated character. The murder scenes are filled with such tension, and the idea of chopping someone up into pieces whiles doing a soliloquy of why Huey Lewis's songs and music is so influential (which Bale's does as he usual waxes nostagicaly about 80's music while he's about to pounce on his victims) was just unreal.<br/><br/>Interesting twist in the end as well.  However, there is only one interesting character in this film and everyone else is pretty plastic and uninteresting.  But I suppose that's the idea, thus making us feel no sympathy for any of these yuppie scums.<br/><br/>Rating 7 out of 10"

","I have not read the book, so I cannot write a review that says...""Read the book! You will appreciate the film even more!"", or anything.<br/><br/>   However, I feel that what this movie was trying to express, I believe it expressed it effectively. <br/><br/>   OK, I am not a horror junkie...I'm a romantic comedy person! I hate gory movies, (*hate*), but I'm telling whoever's reading this that hasn't seen it; the movie has no gore in it. Yes, you see blood, but you never see the blood *with* the person it belongs to, if that makes any sense. Sure, there is one scene suggesting a particularly violent chainsaw incident, but you really don't see much...which is *good* =).<br/><br/>   I'm not sure why some people thought this was boring... the way the film was directed it was supposed to make you understand how Bateman could possibly become this blood-crazed. Everything around him seems fake, trivial, in excess, or all three. He can't relate to anyone because everyone, even his close colleagues, are stuck on themselves. Someone wrote that they were bored by the film because they felt that everyone was like Bateman; the only difference was that they didn't kill people.  Well, I definitely believe that was dir Mary Harron's attempt.<br/><br/>
  Bateman had to go to extremes; 1 000 crunches a day, watching intense pornographic movies, extreme slasher flicks, dining at the finest restaurants, wearing the finest clothes, having the nicest business card; simply because anything more normal would remind him of the sick and sad decadence of the 80's. The fact that Bateman tells his friend, who does a line of coke and says it's only sweetener, "" We'll just have to do more lines , then"", exemplifies attitude of going to extremes.<br/><br/>   I believe there also *may* be an anti-Republican sentiment in this movie. As Bateman and his friends are admiring Ronald Reagan's speech at the end of the movie, while taking conservative views over political issues scattered sporadically throughout the film, one may assume the cliche that Republicans are the ones with the money who are always seeking to get richer, and who are disgusted by the poor. I don't want to say that the film uses this cliche, but rather suggests it, without abusing its subtlety.<br/><br/>
   All in all,(like I'm sure is what happens in the book), nothing is really solved as far as a changed man, relief, or even more self-love for Bateman himself. Only more emptiness.  I understand that  people want some sort of resolution to save their souls after watching a disturbing movie,  but come on. His last narration, the last few lines of the movie, explain *why* there is no resolution. To those who haven't yet seen, pay attention to this last scene; it will make you understand why Bateman is a lot more like us than we want to believe!<br/><br/><br/><br/>
SPOILER    WARNING     SPOILER      WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I don't know why people get so bent out of shape at how disturbing this film is. It's no more graphic and scary than the violence you see in horror movies today. The only reason it might be more disturbing is because people don't want to find similarities between themselves and Patrick.<br/><br/><br/><br/>  What I really don't get is why people don't cut it some slack, since Patrick was dreaming the entire time. It's not like he was *completely* loathing, or he literally got away with murder.<br/><br/><br/><br/>-Sep"

Enough to sustain an hour and a half? Nope.<br/><br/>PSYCHO presents a unique narrative structure, but it doesn't work. If this were a `Hollywood' movie, the first two acts would be devoted to how and why Bateman entered this cutthroat yuppie world and how he began to succeed, despite his reprehensible motives. But instead, the movie begins with Bateman already a success. We find him nearing the downward slope of his relationship with this phony world. As such, the movie really has nowhere to go and nowhere to take us. The damn thing is over before it begins.<br/><br/>By the third act, we're begging for a payoff and nothing substantial arrives.

","""American Psycho"" focuses on the excessiveness of the business lifestyle of the late 80s. It is an interesting exaggeration on several levels. Because it is such an over the top story, it is a good comedy and a good movie.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a typical businessman on wall street. He is a rich yuppie stud with an apartment that looks more like an art work. His daily morning activities include lengthy showers and healthy work outs. Patrick uses at least four or five various soaps and lotions to keep his skin smooth and perfect. His main area of focus is his handsome face. Patrick is also very fit since he tells us that he is able to do 1000 crunches every day. He dresses in fancy suits and goes to work, where we hardly see him do anything different than watch TV or listen to music. His favorite activity is going to expensive restaurants and having cynical conversations about business related topics. His friends are not much different looking than him. In fact, Patrick is mistaken for another man from his company on more than one occasion. This is no coincidence. The person continues to address him incorrectly, believing he is speaking to someone else. Patrick also has a girlfriend played by Reese Witherspoon. He hardly pays any attention to her. He prefers to listen to his walkman. Finally, whenever he finds the time, Patrick is a psychopathic serial killer.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is very stylish and very well directed by Mary Harron. She creates simple and perfect surroundings appropriate for a man so concerned with his looks. Christian Bale plays the obsessive businessman very well. He gives the film the additional mechanical feel. Everything he seems to say is such a package. Nothing seems human, but rather an excessive and unnatural pose. He talks like an ad for restaurants and like a review of his favorite albums. Nothing seems to separate him from his friends, except for his dark secret. He takes pleasure in killing. And this seems very mechanical as well. Why does he do it? Why does he do anything?<br/><br/>There are some great scenes in ""American Psycho."" One of them is the shower scene described above. Another excellent scene takes place in an office where Patrick and his friends are comparing business cards. They all carry them around in special metal cases as if they were worth a fortune. As they show them to each other, the cards seem exactly the same. Yet this is a tense scene. The subtle differences (the color of one card is described as ""egg shell"") create competition. Patrick shows signs of his paranoia as he realizes that his card is not the best one. There is also another good appearance by Jared Leto, who essentially serves the same purpose here as he did in ""Fight Club."" In my opinion, he is perfect for the role.<br/><br/>And so, Patrick Bateman kills people. It has been criticized that the movie is pointless and there is no motive for all the murders. It doesn't matter. ""American Psycho"" is a SATIRE. The murders are funny, not always, but often. Patrick bateman is confused himself. He is having an identity crisis. This is the only thing that separates him from anyone else. The murders are an exaggeration just like the rest of his life.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is a good film that lags at certain times. However, Chirtian Bale gives a great performance in a movie that is very attractive in its mechanical nature. It is such an exaggeration that it cannot be taken seriously like other serial killer movies. This is a comedy that looks good and works well. Overall, an 8 out of 10."

She has had a major crush on Christian Bale since Newsies, i've had one since Little Women. We were so excited about seeing ""American Psycho"" for months. But we had to wait until it came out on video because of the rating. We both scrunched up on the couch under blankets expecting to see a horror movie, sorta a slasher film. Our first reaction was ""OMG Christian Bale, he looks sooo good!"" Our second reaction was ""OMG! Christian Bale's butt!"" But then reality kicked in. Christian is the greatest actor i've ever seen and he protrayed Pat Bateman very well, too well actually. From what we saw of the movie there was cold hatred of everything and everyone but himself. The scene with the poor colored man and the dog was unnecessary, if it was to show how cruel he was there was no point. We saw how cruel he was when he killed his partner because he had a better business card than Pat. My friend and i were so disgusted with the movie that we turned it off after watching only a half hour. We decided we had enough after the prostitutes came. That was unnecessary, and the scene where he was watching a porn movie was unnecessary too. There might have been importance to what he was doing or saying, but did the movie have to be on in the background? I think not. I personally think anyone who could enjoy a movie like ""American Psycho"" is as insane and sadistic as Mr. Bateman himself."

","Spoiler alert<br/><br/>One scene describes the basic problem - Bateman moving nervously, secretively and giddily through his apartment, gathering the essential tools (an axe, a raincoat) while espousing to a co-worker/soon to be victim, the merits of Huey Lewis and the News in a staccato cadence, and then... - an implied murder. No shots of the victim getting axed, just shots of an enraged Bateman swinging an axe and getting blood spurted up onto his face.<br/><br/>
If your going to make a movie based on Bret Easton Ellis' notorious novel, you better have the guts to go all the way. You can't choose one of the more disturbing books on the shelf, and then fail to utilize the very parts of the book that make it disturbing.<br/><br/>And that's really the crux of the matter. The direction is quite excellent in parts, and my kudos to the director for knowing how to frame a shot really, really well. Christian Bale's performance is fantastic. He is 100% believable as a psychopath. (actually I'm convinced that anybody who owns more than one Whitney Houston album is more than slightly disturbed) The look and feel of the film are perfect. What's missing is the heavy body blows that the story requires. The excruciating gore, the torture, the ON SCREEN violence, in the book, all of these things are intended to at first juxtapose against and then gradually blend into his Yuppie Scum lifestyle. (He's supposedly clean cut, but he's actually a serial killer. He's supposedly a perfect catch, but he's frighteningly misogenistic, just like the culture and the era) To ""get"" the disturbed point, that all these 80's wall-street shop-till-you-drop, in-crowd, reservation having, business card dropping, homophobic, sexist, racist pigs are indistinguishable from the worst kind of monsters and practice on a societal level what the monsters practice on a personal level... to ""get"" the point you need the most vicious contrast possible. That's why ellis wrote it in the first place. The end doesn't make any sort of sense unless the violence and gore is too horrible to imagine. Then you can see that possibly, just possibly this was all some sort of twisted fantasy... in the movie it just looks like he got away with the whole thing.<br/><br/>

The main character of the film is a thoroughly disgusting rich boy who, by day, holds a position of importance in some nondescript office setting and, by night, tortures and kills - mostly killing those less financially fortunate than him. He's meant to be portrayed as a man who is beautiful on the surface but ugly on the inside.  However, the character is so empty and so void of any character that he's thoroughly and completely ugly.  I find it unbelievable that any of the other characters would find him attractive in any way, shape, or form.  During the film, we hear him describe his beautification regimen in the beginning, then later we hear him describe his fear as he hides evidence after a killing.  It's bad enough that we have to see this waste of a human being - do we have to hear him talk about his habits and emotions as if we care?  This film breaks one of the most important rules for holding an audiences' attention - the main character should be someone that the audience cares about.  The murders and the aftermath of these murders contain some very unfunny scenes that I assume were meant to be humorous.  Is this tongue-in-cheek humor?  Do we even care?  I don't think so."

","Let me just start off by saying that American Psycho is, in fact, my favorite book.  I think that is a hilarious and razor sharp satire.  A wonderfully funny black comedy, albeit (at times) a very graphic and disturbing one.  Obviously I had very mixed feelings about the idea of an American Psycho film.  It was something that I wanted to see, but at the same time, I didn't think that it could be pulled off.  So it was with great reservations that I went into the theatre to see the film. 	I loved it.  I think that Marry Harron has made the best possible adaptation that ever could have been made from Ellis' book.  Without presenting a literal adaptation Harron manages to stay very faithful to the tone and spirit of the novel.  The idea of combining the Huey Lewis/Genesis/Whitney Houston chapters with the murder scenes was brilliant. By keeping the on screen violence to a minimum she let the satire shine right through. 	Christian Bale's performance was fantastic.  He managed to portray Bateman not just as a monster, but also as the dork that he really is.  The infantile behavior of Bateman and the men around him is almost perfectly captured from the novel. 	My only real complaint is that the movie could have been longer.  There could have been more conversations between Bateman and the guys, Bateman and Evelyn, Bateman and Courtney.  It would have added so much more depth to characters that, as is, run the risk of becoming flat.  Overall though, I really enjoyed the film.  This may not be the best movie that I see all year, but I think that it is as good an American Psycho movie as any fan of the book could have hoped for.  7/10"

","Don't know if Christian Bale is still considered a British actor, but he was very convincing as the narcissistic, wacko American of the 80s. The film poked fun at everything that was sacred in the 80s, from banal music to itty-bitty California cuisine to self-indulgence, and more. The director must be given credit for managing to satirize the violence -note, we didn't see that much blood, and very little if any of the actual hacking, or munching (yuk!). <br/><br/>At the end of the film, I was left thinking -hey, what was going on here?

","Not a bad film at all.  Christian Bale is GREAT.  Stylistically it is a very, very interesting movie.  The satire of 80's culture is definitely fun to watch if you lived through it.  The dialogue is bang on and the cultural references bring back many painful memories of the idiotic trends (pet pigs anyone?)  The humour is especially sly at times.  For example, all the guys have such similiar haircuts, its futile trying to tell them apart, yet you don't really have to in order to understand the story.  It's the little jokes like that that do it for me.  In addition, the mostly off-screen violence was especially well done.<br/><br/>The one problem with the movie is a loss of momentum.  It begins ferociously with Bateman displaying his incredible self-indulgence and force of will. Gradually this slips away as the movie's clarity becomes unfocused in parallel with Bateman's deteriorating psyche.  I think the director could've improved things for the audience either by distancing the narrative from Bateman's perceptions, or by fusing them together more tightly. Unfortunately, she sort of sits on the fence, so we're left doubting her direction.  There are also a number of awkward scenes that really didn't have much point.<br/><br/>Still, for all the things this movie could've been, it didn't come up too short.

","It must be said:  If I hadn't read Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho -- memorized it, in fact -- I don't think I would have had the slightest idea what was supposed to be happening in the movie.  A movie needs plot; this has none.  A movie needs momentum; you could rearrange the scenes from the first half of American Psycho in any order and no one would notice.  The ideas are confused, the structure is nonexistent, the dialogue is virtually inaudible under the INXS din, and Christian Bale has chosen an odd, odd time to reveal to the world that he is actually JIM CARREY, or at least an inbred cousin of his ( by the end Bale's impersonation of Carrey had become so distracting that I was basically sweating and gibbering along with the Bateman character. )<br/><br/>So why did I like it so much?  Because I HAVE read the book, and the movie is a far more ruthless vivisection of Ellis than it is of the soulless, Reaganite, greed-driven 80's and all those boring received ideas that have been shoved down our throats by the media in the defanging process that the movie essentially represents.  Represents, I say, because when all the smoke has cleared ( what smoke? what am I talking about? ) the movie will probably be seen as the ideal complement to the book -- the two reflect on each other like brutally shattered mirrors.<br/><br/>Basic summary:  The book is a comedy classic, with reams and reams of hilariously insipid yuppie repartee, but it was never as disturbing as the people who never bothered to read it thought.  The movie is disturbing.  In the book, when Patrick Bateman lures a prostitute back to his apartment for a second time after mutilating her in some undescribed way, it's just a joke, a variation on a theme.  But in the movie, the woman playing the prostitute has such a sad, symbolic, almost saintly face, that her death scene -- which is like one of the more unsubtle episodes of Itchy & Scratchy, by the way -- had even the people in the audience who were previously content to treat the whole thing as a joke actually GASPING.  It made me realize how really powerful and uncomfortable the book could have been if it dropped its protective mask of irony for a page or two.<br/><br/>On the other hand, director Mary Harron sometimes plays it safe, content to deliver up little sushi slices of American Psycho's Greatest Hits -- the business card contretemps, the Huey Lewis exegesis, even a sign on a door that says ""This is not an exit.""  In moments like these the movie is Classics Illustrated, a reductio ad absurdum, the final proof that American Psycho has been chewed up by mama bird and made nice and mushy for baby bird's consumption.  It's too bad, because Harron has a very real gift for offbeat direction -- when she's on she's downright KUBRICKIAN, and from me this is the highest compliment imaginable."

American Psycho, the novel, was a satire on the decadent lifestyle of the 80's and its trappings.  Of course the consequences were taken to extremes but its point was well made.  American Psycho, the movie, is a well done adaptation of the novel with only a few shortcomings.  Unlike the terrible movie, Less Than Zero, American Psycho stays true to the general fell and ideas of the novels. The sex and violence, while not completely removed, was not as explicit in the book.  Bale is superb as Patrick Bateman, although the Bateman that I envisioned from reading the novel was quite different and I suppose that was the main flaw of the film for me.  While reading the novel, Bateman was much more sinister to me, much more evil.  In the movie, Bateman seems to understand that what he really wants is to be accepted and to be seen as the best.  In the book, he was much more sure of himself.  All in all, I thought the movie was really well done, however it will face the same problems as the novel.

","AMERICAN PSYCHO is Mary Harron's second feature film after her acclaimed I SHOT ANDY WARHOL(and an episode for the TV series Homicide). Her movie has been long in the making, frequently having been discussed, because the studio obviously wanted Leonardo Di Caprio for the leading role of the young big business executive who is - for a pastime- also a serial killer. Harron was opposed to this casting decision and she managed to get Christian Bale whose greatest role till now might have been as Little Jim in Spielberg's EMPIRE OF THE SUN. I read Bret Easton Ellis's infamous novel and must admit I was quite bored. It is an endless succession of what Mr. Bateman wears, uses for his hygiene, what he eats and what he thinks about everything in general, all in a disgusting yuppie pseudo-smartass tone. His very drastically described massacres hardly contribute to making the book more accessible. Mary Harron, however, accomplished the amazing: a movie which is much better than the book! Here she has found a style to envision Bateman's vanity, delicately focusing on the empty icons of this strange society of yuppie executives and staging it slightly as satire with many occasions for the audience to get a laugh. This is something which Ellis is completely incapable of, but probably had intended. The best scenes are where the guys compare their business cards and everyone is envious of the other's, although they all look more or less the same. Bateman eventually kills one of his colleagues for just the reason that his card looks more exclusive. Bateman's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality slowly intermingles so that, at the end, he cannot  distinguish between the two sides of his existence anymore. Although his hideous crimes, artfully staged by Harron between horror and hilarity, can't be overseen anymore, the people around him are so vain that they don't even notice what's happening. As Bateman realizes at the end: ""My confession means nothing at all"", so has the film managed to show us that his existence is just the same. In a small role as Bateman's secretary, Chloe Sevigny is well cast, as always a bit sleepy and slow, but just perfect in this movie. One detail I really liked especially: I always knew that Nouvelle Cuisine was nothing but disgusting and an insult to true cuisine culture. I'll give 10/10"

Director Mary Harron has treated the very questionable material by Bret Easton Ellis much better than it deserves.  She understands that leaving things to our imaginations is much more powerful than actually showing them and the violence in the movie is doubly disturbing precisely because of that. Is it me or it seems that lately women directors like Harron and Kimberley Pierce from ""Boys Don't Cry"" are bringing much more cojones to movies than the rest of the Hollywood gang?  Their movies are streamlined, intelligent, unsentimental, and very well directed.  They are kicking male butt. You go, girls!  For one, I think Boys Don't Cry was a much better movie than any of the Oscar contenders this year. As for the eighties portrayed in American Psycho, they are suspiciously similar to the nineties and so far to the zeros as well.  Insane obsessions with brands and logos, crazy food, restaurant madnesses and a total disregard for anything but money and greed. Ignorant yuppies ruling the world. Sound familiar? American Psycho could have taken place in New York today.  The only difference is that instead of Huey Lewis, Patrick Bateman would be deconstructing Britney Spears."

","American Psycho is based on Bret Easton Ellis' novel and I haven't even read it. But from they people that did not many really liked it, as it was highly controversial. When news came out that a movie was being made the controversy started again with groups wanting to boycott this film!<br/><br/>Do I care? Do you? Seeing a guy running down a corridor wearing nothing but trainers and waving a chainsaw is something you'll probably only see in this movie and that's what matters the most here! Well. maybe!<br/><br/>The film basically is set in the 80's and tells us about the character Patrick Bateman, a guy who seems to be losing control of himself and is killing lots of people! Moving away from the basic premise. no wait, that's pretty much it! So the plot is very thin, but there's more to this then you might think.<br/><br/>Patrick Batemen is a Wall Street broker who never really seems to be busy. He has a girlfriend Evelyn (Witherspoon), a very classy apartment, takes frequent trips to exclusive restaurants, and has an average business card. Bateman also has another side to him, this being killing people when he has the time, and he has a lot of it! Christian Bales performance is outstanding as we're invited to look into Patrick Batemens life, someone who is out of control with his life and losing himself, yet he still manages to get away with it by showing himself as the guy you see going to work. Also the films portrayal of the 80's gives you a lot to laugh about! The clothes, the music, the people, the technology. How just about everything in the 80's was quite crap really. Batemen going on endlessly about his knowledge of music being one point!<br/><br/>I'm sure most people out there will see this as one of those violent movies with no point at all. How very wrong they are. There isn't as much violence as you might think, with the camera panning away from extreme shots, yet this still might be likely to offend.  As for being classed as a slasher or horror movie, this is more in fact a comedy then anything else with the movie making fun of the setting and it's characters, mainly Patrick Batemen. But really the situations and dialogue all raise a laugh somewhere as well as a shock. Its use of mistaken identity seems to be the films point as to how everyone is someone, but no one fully knows anyone at all with people easily being mistaken for others. The ending is a little perplexing and it makes the whole thing feel unfinished as to whether Batemen did these murders or were they just something he made up? Checking the Internet Movie Database message for this film will show a range of topics with most deciding the ""did he"" or ""didn't he"" argument. On the whole other cast members put in a worthy performance but they don't match up to that of Christian Bale!<br/><br/>The film is great, sharply funny and a little hard on the head after leaving the cinema. But still I can't help feeling that there should have been more.<br/><br/>My rating - 7 out of 10"

This adaptation of American Psycho is interesting, at times repellent, at times hilarious, yet strangely uninvolving and ultimately lacking in any real satirical bite. Christian Bale delivers a highly stylised performance; when he gives his critiques of Huey Lewis and Genesis prior to committing some atrocity, he reminded me of none other than Jim Carrey in his Ace Ventura days. By the scene where Bateman casually explodes a cop car with his revolver, it is clear that the murders we see - with the possible exception of the homeless man in the alley, and the attempted murder of his secretary - are entirely imaginary. These factors combine to make it less a portrait of a society and culture where surface is everything and more of a chamber piece portrayal of an individual's dysfunctional mind."

","The Age of Sex Crime is still with us thanks to the work of the British tabloid press in blowing out of proportion the pathetic antics of the so-called Jack the Ripper. Every so often a film comes along which is only a vehicle for the murder and dismemberment of women. American Psycho is such a showcase for 80-style yuppie gore. In Stockholm Sweden, this film was reviewed without any details about the murders of women right and left--in fact, only the yuppie lifestyle was reported. Its not hard to imagine that this young crowd even emulated the film, as does the movie site, where you can design your own business card. Why is it fashionable to rape, murder and dismember women in films--because its important to remember that women can never be in charge. Why were not the psycho's yuppie girlfriends harmed: they were in his class. Why did Jack the Ripper murder prostitutes: he could distance himself from them, as if they were animals. Over a hundred years later, Mary Harron elevates Bret Easton Ellis' twisted empty novel to full screen. Its important to point out a woman did this--as women typically do the hatchet work for men, such as holding down young girls and mutilating their genitalia. This is what Harron symbolically has done for Bret Easton Ellis. Its hard to elevate films which are rascist today--we've evolved that far--but even Spike Lee has a terrible view of women, as does Quentin Tarantino, and Mary Harron. When we start separating the violence to women in films from the so-called features of a movie--or rather when we realize that in mutilating women, the film has no real basis any longer and is just a perpetuation of women hatred, we will start seeing some really good work. Harron has a quick ride to fame on this one, and therefore negates all previous work where her achievements were outstanding."

The cast has been cleverly chosen, with the protagonist, Bale, in brilliant form as the ostensibly charming and truly psychotic Patrick Bateman. Dafoe as the razor-sharp Detective Kimball and Sevigny secretary Jean are also most convincing and support the unfolding of the narrative wonderfully.<br/><br/>Director Harron's ultimate strength is her masterful technique of weaving together reality and (violent) fantasy into a fabric so smooth that you are likely to be left wondering which is which.

","I finished the book of this a week before seeing it in the cinema, so I was interested in comparing the two. In summary I found the film was completely untrue to the spirit of the book. Let me explain what I mean by that -<br/><br/>In the book, Patrick Bateman does have severe psychotic episodes, the book also has passages of very dry, ironic humour.  These never overlap and are kept as seperate events, this is not so in the film.  For example in the film Patrick dances around the room to some 1980's band while repeating a long diatribe about the band before plunging an axe into his male victim. In the book these psychotic events are never portrayed with anything but a straight face.  The film by mixing these up tends to trivialise the acts of mental instability.<br/><br/>This apart at least the film wasn't a splatter fest.<br/><br/>Taking the film as just that, without reading the book it is probably quite refreshing.  An American film that doesn't have a stereotypical plot with an ending that you can see a mile off.<br/><br/>I guess if you've read the book you'll be dissappointed, otherwise it's a worthwhile 1.75 hours of your time."

","Based on Bret Easton Ellis' bleak satirical novel of the same name, Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) makes a valiant attempt to make the graphical horror of the book into a censor-friendly comment on the hedonistic coke-fuelled 80's world of the psychotic protagonist, Wall Street broker Patrick Bateman.<br/><br/>Through arty camera work and intense monologues, Harron plays up the satire of Bateman's character with his obsession with business cards and designer clothes which border on fetish. The film effectively builds up the claustrophobia of a world with such intensity that you begin to empathise with Bateman's mania, a world where you are judged on your credit card and your ability to get a reservation in a swanky restaurant. The violence is mixed with jet-black humour, (in one scene Bateman dances to Huey Lewis before attacking a victim with an axe). Frustrated by his self-obsessed girlfriend Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) and his floosy mistress Courtney (Samantha Mathis), Bateman Bateman's whimsical killing spree intensifies as his violence spills onto the street and his psychotic urges become ever more stronger. Jean (Chloe Sevigny) is his pretty but dim-witted secretary and suspects nothing of Bateman's murderous secret life as she falls in love with his charming, sophisticated facade.<br/><br/>American Psycho superbly illustrates the nullifying period of the materialistic 80s.

Christian Bale is excellent as the chiseled Patrick Bateman who just cracks and becomes a destructive force to any unfortunate soul who has the misfortune to end up in his apartment. From ""American Psycho"", we take a look at the yuppie who is so caught up within their own pathetic existence that they are oblivious to the real world itself. An example includes a frustrated Bateman drawing a photo of one of his victim's decapitations on a paper table cover with crayons. His high maintenence girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon in a small role) is too busy looking over photos of herself. A friend had to explain the film to me after I saw it because there are a lot of details that go relatively unnoticed in the film. With considerable gore aside, ""American Psycho"" forces you to look at yourself as a human being and has you ask yourself ""Are you happy with what you've become?""

","When Bret Easton Ellis's novel American Psycho was first published in 1991, it was described as misogynistic and sadistic by the humourless idiots who decide these things, so it comes as something of a surprise to find it adapted to the screen by two women. It centres around Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a Wall Street mergers and acquisitions man, who takes narcissism to levels even Robbie Williams couldn't imagine and kills people, mainly women, in his spare time. <br/><br/>Bateman simply has no soul, no real identity. He merely wishes to fit in and please himself  not be happy, he has no concept of it. Such a blank slate inevitably reflects its surroundings. Unfortunately, these are the 1980s and Bateman is at the top of the greedy tree. He obsesses about facial cleansing, Armani suits and business cards. After he is laughed at when asking for a table at an exclusive restaurant at the last minute, he lashes out at a helpless homeless man. A flood gate seems to have been opened in his psyche and he meticuluosly and savagely kills a fellow broker who believes he is someone else. The women follow, but we don't see them, we see Bateman's normal everyday life continue unaffected. A policeman (Willem Dafoe) arrives to investigate the disappearance of the broker, but he doesn't come back. In the end, Bateman, trying harder and harder to get caught, can take it no more, but his society will not let him take credit, will not grant him an identity.<br/><br/>Bale is utterly flawless as Bateman, exuding a cool that is superhuman. Chloë Sevigny is excellent as his dim but human secretary and Defoe fills the screen as the cop eerily similar to Bateman. As a satire of the awful '80s this is great stuff (Whitney Houston seriously deserved being taken down a peg or two), humorous and observant.

","How well do you really know your co-workers?  Your friends?  Your relatives? `American Psycho' dives deep into the mind of a serial killer and almost allows you to feel what he is experiencing.  Based on the controversial best selling novel by Bret Easton Ellis, the movie follows pretty much the same premise as the book.  <br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a poster boy for the eighties.  He wears expensive suits.  Eats extravagant meals of swordfish meatloaf.  Has an apartment overlooking the park. However something is missing in his life. To fill the void, Bateman takes up perverse sexual practices and even resorts to killing total stranger and personal associates.  Even after all the blood is absorbed into the urine soaked concrete of the Manhattan sidewalks, Bateman is still unhappy.  What even makes it worse is that no one seems to notice.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is flawless in a role that few people lined up to play.  His performance in this movie has given the Oscar race a good jumpstart which barring any unseen potholes should continue right up until nominations.<br/><br/>`American Psycho' delivers its share of problems as well.  Script holes tend to tatter it throughout its screen time and thought the movie, the dialog seems to be improvised rather than scripted.  In a movie of this subject matter, lines should flow as smooth or perhaps even smoother than silk.  We cannot tolerate conversation as though it was being preformed in front of a live audience in New York.<br/><br/>**1/2<br/><br/>6/10"

","Walking home after seeing Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"", I began to piece the film together in my head, and when all the little moments, the satirical digs, the violent set pieces were seen as a whole, I was struck by what Harron had presented to me.  She and her co-writer, Guinevere Turner (adapting a much-maligned Brett Easton Ellis novel which I admittedly have not read), have given us a cold, dark satirical look into the blackness that resides within the postmodern image culture, and the first really memorable film of the twenty-first century.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman, our title character, is a real nowhere man.  A hotshot New York financial broker, Patrick is deep into the '80s world of drugs, flash, and meaningless consumption.  It has rendered him a hollow soul, a blank like the white-toothed haircuts who surround him at his board table.  The problem is, unlike everyone around him, he knows what a charade, what a puppet he and his whole world are, and it's driving him mad.  He can't control the rage that his pointless life brings bubbling to the surface, and it lashes out in fits of brutal, slashing violence (in the film's most memorable scene of violence, a co-worker gets an ax to the face for committing the unforgivable sin of having a business card more tasteful than Patrick's).  He slips further and further into horribleness, and all the while, he is concealed by his facade of smooth-money good looks and power. Finally, he totally loses his grip on reality, but when he tries to give himself over to condemnation, no one will believe it.  After all, his clothes are so fine, his apartment so extravagant, his business card so crisp and just-so...<br/><br/>Harron's direction unflinchingly captures the almost silly decadence of this big-cash world, where young businessmen are interchangeable and their jobs are nondescript.  She and Turner handle the film's violent sequences skillfully, making them genuinely jarring without allowing them to overwhelm the film's satirical points.  Indeed, this is one of the few recent black comedies that really works, delivering laughs and shivers in about equal measure.  Much of this is owing to some splendid work by Christian Bale in the lead.  At first, I found Bale's put-on masculine vocal tone and smarmy smile too forced and slick, but as the film went on, I realized that they are a shield for a fevered mind, a shield that is becoming increasingly strained as events (and bodies) pile up.  It's bravura acting, and amazingly, Bale almost makes us feel for Patrick as he realizes, in absolute horror, that he has indeed gotten away with murder.  <br/><br/>Technically, the film is sharply handled, with special kudos going to Gideon Ponte's chillingly sterile art direction and to a finely chosen selection of ultra-bland '80s tunes (I'll never be able to listen to Phil Collins' ""Sussudio"" with a straight face again).<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is able to hide his crimes behind perfect hair, perfect clothes, a perfect lifestyle.  And he's constantly being mistaken for other people.  What could they be hiding behind their facades?  What can people get away with if able to conceal anything behind the right image?  In a culture like ours, where the image is becoming more and more powerful as a tool of judgment, the message of ""American Psycho"" is one that can't be wiped away with laughter or wiped out with violence.  Like Patrick in the film's final shot, we just have to look it in the eyes and learn whatever we can."

","I don't understand the negative comments. People refer to the film like it was a horror film: ""I never jumped once!"" they exclaim. You didn't jump because you weren't supposed to. The point everyone is missing is that this film is a brilliant satire of the 80's and of yuppy life. Everything had a point here, and it wasn't to scare anyone, or make you ""jump"". It's a satire, a black comedy! I, for one, found the film hilarious and witty, and I think this was a good role for Reese itherspoon. The lack of supporting characters was also for a reason: So that Bateman isn't proved wrong. We're supposed to hate the people around him, too, to understand his Point of view-and I did. People decry this film as disgusting and all of that - well, lighten up. It's not a horror film, it isn't supposed to scare you- and the plot it's missing isn't missing at all- It's character study.

","I've read many of the other comments concerning this movie and those that hated it complain about the film's lack of conventional structure (ie, a plot) and lack of a clear-cut ending. Well, that is the point of this story. Like real life, there isn't necessarily rising action, a climax and a conclusion. Like the book, there is no exit for Patrick Bateman, nor is there one for us. We simply enter his life for a period of time, watch him operate, then move on.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I was not 100% satisfied with the translation from novel to film. I think Mary Harron copped out - trying to create a hip, satirical, self-aware, ironic version of this story. Pity. The book was far more sadistic, vicious, funny, disgusting, and it did a better job of charting Bateman's descent into madness.<br/><br/>While the film did capture the superficiality of the ""me"" decade, it appears very weak since the 90s were even more greedy and superficial. The film also failed to capture Bateman's habit of describing people via their wardrobe - he knows EVERY label of every item that his male and female peers are wearing. In the book, it is hilarious and aptly illustrates how superficial the character and the decade are.<br/><br/>See this movie. But, read the book first."

","Hmmm...I read 'American Psycho' last summer after a friend recommended it to me, and I enjoyed the book immensely, although I can't say why.  The constant obsession with clothing, restaurants and other such trivia is initially amusing, but soon becomes tiresome.  The graphic violence is possibly the only thing I have ever read that has made me wince, and while there is a sick, voyeuristic comedy in each scene, it does not make the basis for a classic novel.  The plot merely serves as an excuse for the character of Bateman to go about his business, and the ending is (perhaps purposefully) devoid of any sense of closure.<br/><br/>And yet, I enjoyed the book.  Maybe, like any good controversy, there is a certain satisfaction in being part of a group of supporters, revelling in the cult appeal and the horrified gasps of the newspaper, screaming 'Ban this sick filth TM' at every given opportunity.  The movie has a similar cache, although the way it has largely been reviewed and marketed, you could easily have mistaken it for a much more mainstream production.<br/><br/>The fact that it was touted more as a black comedy ultimately spoiled it for me.  It simply wasn't funny enough, and the points which were funny sat somewhat incongruously with the rest of the movie.  That scene was amusing because it was played for laughs, in a totally over the top fashion, in total contrast to the deadpan sarcasm of most of the other scenes.  The killings were never particularly difficult to watch, and in removing the most brutal elements the film has become almost completely empty of controversy, which was a necessity for filming the novel, and makes one wonder what exactly is left?<br/><br/>Not enough to make my girlfriend care about the movie, that's for sure.  I enjoyed seeing some scenes of the novel brought to life, but as a movie on its own, there simply isn't enough entertainment or even social commentary to recommend this."

","I don't know why, but my local newspaper gave American Psycho such rave reviews. So, reading that review coupled with the fact that I like Reese Witherspoon as an actress, I was dying (no pun intended) to see it. I'm a horror fan who rarely gets nightmares and can leave visions of terror on the screen once the film is over, and though this film isn't intended to be horror but suspense, it managed to scare me and give me nightmares. It isn't the kind of fright that's fun and enjoyable like that which comes from the adrenaline rush you get watching chase scenes in ""Halloween"" or ""Scream."" It's one that disturbs and offends. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br/><br/>Set in the 1980's, the title ""American Psycho"" chronicles the daily life of a young 27-year-old prematurely successful Wall Street businessman who, by night, is a murderous psycho with disgusting tastes in film and a proclivity to kill graphically & imaginatively. Nice! He makes Skeet Ulrich's ""Scream"" character look like Mickey Mouse. Reese Witherspoon's talent is wasted; she only appears briefly in a few scenes as the woman who so wants to marry Christian Bale's psycho killer Patrick Bateman, unaware, of course, that her man is a murderous sociopath quite capable of killing her, too. Patrick manages to kill off a few acquaintances & friends throughout the film. You end up scared out of your mind every time he has dialogue with each of the characters. He manages to incorporate lewd sexual acts with some of his killing rituals. He also obsesses over porn, song lyrics, & ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" from which he collects some of his ideas for killing people & dealing with the remains afterward. He's like a financially successful, handsome, heterosexual Hollywood version of Jeffrey Dahmer. And, yes, like Dahmer, Patrick also takes pleasure in cruelty to animals. It gets no better throughout the whole movie. While I was expecting there to at least be a point to this sick plot in the end, I was disappointed by a discouraging and unrealistic ending.<br/><br/>The film is somewhat like ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (though that was a good movie) meets ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with a pornographic rich Wall Street yuppie twist. Patrick's saner Wall Street colleagues are sexist pigs who show no respect for women, and Patrick himself exerts his dominance over them in the sex scenes in a most annoyingly medieval fashion. The film features few women on Wall Street; most of them are spoiled socialites aiming to marry someone like the wealthy Patrick. I've heard feminists in political debates accuse Corporate America of discriminating against and insulting women, but this film insults women and Wall Street at the same time. Ladies & businesspeople keep away! For that matter, everyone should keep away from this horrid film."

The amount of blood and grusome murders in this film were severely lacking. Let me just say that I am not a perverted maniac who gets off on this kind of thing, but to make the film work properly, and to really grasp the horror of this psycho, it needed more to shock an audience. For example, when Patrick chops off the blokes head, you only see blood and a slumped out of focus leg on camera, very tame indeed. I thought it would be more Texas Chain Sawish, where there were some quite horrible moments, but it was not to be.  The acting was good, and Bale played his vain businessman excellently.  The whole cast were good but the camera direction let it down.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend, but not really an 18 in my book, apart from a lot of sex, but even those scenes were quite tame, with no frontal shots of the women at all.

Be it Ash or Leatherface, give the lead a buzz saw to chase down their adversaries, and I'm happy. That's why it was so great to see Patrick Bateman, this movie's titular psycho, running down a hallway, naked, chasing a screaming woman and clutching a roaring chainsaw.<br/><br/>Patrick also watches ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" while working out, executes people while discussing the finer points of Phil Collins, and will kill anyone with a nicer business card than his. In short, he's the best horror character in years, which is why it's sad that this movie shies away from true horror, because I thought it was near perfect.<br/><br/>Well, that's not true- I didn't like the ending (although it leaves the door open for a sequel, which I would be in favor of) and some parts are a little slow, but overall this movie is an excellent look at what it's like to loose one's mind. The whole 1980s setting attempts to make this movie into a parody of the greedy ""me""-decade, but what really shined through for me is Bateman's ever-growing fear and hatred of people, a feeling I'm sure more than one viewer will associate with, which will make it all the more disturbing when Bateman turns murderer.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is beyond perfect as the homicidal maniac who fits in with his upper crust friends and coworkers so well that he becomes invisible.

","That's what I would have said if I hadn't won free tickets.

Obviously this is a no-spoiler zone so I can't reveal it, but suffice it to say that rather than the reality-shifting conceit that turns great films (such as Fight Club or Jacob's Ladder) into arguably greater ones,  turns this one into a thorough waste of time and effort.<br/><br/>Can it be true that this film has already generated controversy? Surely not? Surely in the 21st century we're all used to disembodied heads and chainsaw massacres by now? And if all the right-wing lobbies that complain about sex and violence in movies spend their whole time watching the stuff in order to complain about it, then how come they're not converted into our very own Patrick Batemans? The film actually raises this point itself, with Bateman (Christian Bale), watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre while exercising.<br/><br/>This being England, we got to see a version 4 minutes longer than its U.S. counterpart, as it included senses of lesbianism. It sometimes bothers me that the world is still full of such reactionism that such things can fall foul of censorship. What bothers me more is that films which usually attract such controversy as this usually have the saving grace of being actually quite good - A Clockwork Orange being a notable success in that field. American Psycho, meanwhile, is a fairly average movie, with gory violence that neither shocks nor compels, and a vaguely witty narrative that can be seen as satirical by the same sort of people that think Scream is cleverly ironic.<br/><br/>Bale plays a psychotic with some interesting characteristics. He's anally retentive and talks his victims through the critical plusses of MOR 80s pop-rock. He's also pro-racial equality, yet homophobic and narcissistic. Some of these conflicting character traits are interesting, and Bale does well becoming a semi-monotone serial killer while managing to maintain a level of charisma.<br/><br/>I must make a confession, tantamount to heresy - I haven't read the very popular book on which the film is based. But I see that factor as largely irrelevant; the film should stand on it's own merits, exist without it's source text. So I cannot judge whether it represents the visual ideology of the novel, or whether it betrays its concept. What I do know of the film is that while it does have some flimsy barbs about the nature of consumerism and pitiless American culture, it is ultimately shallow and without meaning.<br/><br/>The cast are all great, the direction is good without being ostentatious and the dialogue is fresh without ever - quite - getting too silly. What it lacks is a core, or purpose. And when the final twist ending comes along, it defies all that went before it and makes you realise that you've sat through a film as pumped-up, self-serving and internally vacant as it's central character."

","As an avid fan of the book, despite its many flaws, I was eager to see what Mary Harron had made of Ellis' work. I found the film to be very different from the novel- less about Patrick Bateman's almost gleeful spree of sex and murder in high society, and more about a rich man watching his life dissolve as he comes to realize how empty everything and everyone in his world is. I found Christian Bale's portrayal of Bateman to be almost as I visualized from the book- handsome, spoiled, wealthy, but with a certain coldness and vacuousness that allows him to take lives without thought. I see now why Harron insisted (even to the point of almost quitting the film) that Bale play Bateman- he was perfect for the role. I am not among those who thought Bateman was imagining the killings (the book makes them too real), and, for me, the lack of violence in the film, or rather, the boiling down of the murders largely into one montage sequence, really detracted from the shock that the book carried with it. In addition, for a film that was supposed to give something of a ""feminist"" treatment of Ellis' novel, I found the female characters, especially Reese Witherspoon's Evelyn, to be sadly underwritten and under-developed. Evelyn is reduced to a whiney sideshow in the film; her relationship with Patrick was much more central to establishing the emptiness of the characters in the book, and leaving her out of all but 2-3 scenes in the film was a major mistake. Instead, Jean, Bateman's secretary, a minor character in the novel, is given much more screen time. I didn't see what the issue was over the ""censored"" sex scene- anything that was cut wasn't obvious, and you still get the feeling of Bateman's utter self-absorption. The cultural references (especially a particularly humorous monologue on Huey Lewis & the News) made for a good showcasing of the characters' fascination with trendiness, money, and power, while still showing how culturally empty the majority of the characters here are. A good film, a bit rushed in parts (another 30-45 minutes could have easily been added), but ultimately, much like the novel, a flawed, but entertaining ride. 6.5 stars out of 10."

","""If you can't say something good about a movie..."" or so the paraphrase goes. I suppose the most glaring thing I can cite about the film is- I DIDN'T PICK UP ANY TIPS!!! What's up with that? ""Modern American Male looking for Love, Lust and just OODLES of blood, desires that special someone who can die C-R-E-A-T-I-V-E-L-Y. Should carry own HMO plan."" Now- how many times have you seen THAT personal ad? Patrick Bateman (acted by Christian Bale- the child star of possibly the best Spielberg film, 1987's ""Empire of the Sun"") as portrayed here is less than two-dimensional. And maybe that's the rub and I just don't get it??? Yowza! There is lots o' talent in this here flic. Bale tosses his native UK-eseic accent wonderfully- but the fascination just DOESN'T CARRY THE FILM!!! No- I didn't read the novel (simple fact: not interested), but due to a true devotee of that raucous best-seller having dropped lots of ""visuals"" about it over a span of time I think I had a feel for it. The director is relatively new, and though she makes a professional-looking production, she don't have the suspense thing down. She could take some lessons from mother Hitchcock, such as ""WATCH MY PSYCHO!"" The film tells you the guy is sick. It shows you why. It ends inconclusively- even hinting that maybe the carnage didn't occur at all. Huh-wha....? Roll credits. Certainly as inventive as the conclusion of ""Fight Club"", I'd say. I was expecting Jackson Pollack and all we get is a spilled cans of Campbell's Tomato Soup. Wassup wid dat? And the really clever part- Bateman constantly reviewing audibly, in front of the potential [more like ""upcoming""] victims, the on-going careers and discographies of such fledgling '80's rock artists like Huey Lewis and Whitney H., that just got me sooooo involved with the almost chronically-deep characterizations. Maybe we or I have become so inured by carnage in the past 20 years or so of American film that I am now starving for a bit of STORY to go with it! Want to get involved in good suspense, wit, and plot? Read the new Spenser novel."

","I think ""American Psycho"" will succeed because repeat viewers will go to the film to watch premier viewers for their reactions to the shocks, ranging from loud and clear racism, sexism, homophobia and oozing violence. This is a phenomenon familiar to fans of the ""Halloween"" genre. My showing began with a young 20-something couple walking out after the characters made some nasty remarks about a Jewish colleague. (Later, I was happy for them. They might have needed resuscitation if they had stayed.)<br/><br/>Actually, after observing the many under-30's at the showing I attended, I understood that the dark humor about 1980's Manhattan was wasted on them. They seemed to react to the graphic violence, but they did not laugh at all. Perhaps these times are too similar for them to those in the film?<br/><br/>I lived in Manhattan during the period of the movie. I was frequently embarrassed by my own lonely laughter during the film. I was getting Ted Bundy looks myself after a while. It was worth the humiliation. I really did enjoy most of it.<br/><br/>As a film, however, it seemed to get sloppy at its end. Without revealing any details, I would say that the film seemed to lose it edgy pace and meticulous style in its last ten or fifteen minutes. I will recommend the film very carefully to certain friends."

It was a long time underway, but definitely worth the wait!<br/><br/>Of course, the movie was not as graphic as the book (or perhaps my imagination!?) and surely it was not intended to be.  Had it been exactly like the novel it would most likely have received a quite different rating! What some people perhaps forget is that the book was intended as a parody of the 80's.

"RBongo","7","0","0","19 April 2000"," Starts Off Very Strong...Then Falls Apart
","I just got back from a screening of the new Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol) film, American Psycho.  I am of mixed feelings when it comes to this film.  I read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis before seeing this film, and I think that potentially changed my final opinion of this film.  So keep that possible bias in your mind while reading this review.<br/><br/>When entering this film, I really didn't know what to expect.  I really did enjoy the novel American Psycho and I didn't know how the point of the film could truly be expressed even by Harron, who had done only one feature to this point, although it was an amazing one.  I settled in and began to take it all in.  The film starts of with a relatively humorous tone...very light compared to the novel's strait-laced opening.  It basically introduces Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as your everyday-high-end-yuppie-who-kills-people-on-the-side kinda guy.  It lets us get acquainted with Bateman's friends, loves, and co-workers as well.  Not too far into the film though, it begins it's slight descension into surreality and nightmarish scenes (don't worry though, the violence in the film is a mere shell of the over-the-top-near-unfilmable violence in the novel, in fact nearly all the violence happens off screen.  Toward the beginning of slide, the film keeps up it's satirical and very humorous look...then it becomes more dark and takes a more serious look at the goings on.  By the end, the viewer has lost touch with what is real in the film and very confused about what to feel for Bateman.<br/><br/>I think that the most impressive thing about the film is the combination of the lead performance and the cinematography in the film. Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, is amazingly great.  It is one of the most oddball performances I have seen, but it is also the most outstanding I have seen as well.  The fluctuation between outright insanity to social restraint, with a melange of emotions in there, is quite simply remarkable. Now none of the other performances merit as much acclaim.  William Defoe as Detective Donald Kimble,following Bateman's case, also registers to a lesser extent in a subtle performance that is the closest the film has to a real person.  Chloe Sevigny has a role that some found impressive, but I find just lacking all around.  Ditto for Jared Leto and Reese Witherspoon who barely register in basically cameo length roles.<br/><br/>The other aspect of the film that really got me was the cinematography of American Psycho.  The lighting cast upon Patrick gives him ""split-faces"", kinda like Jeckyll and Hyde syndrome.  In addition there are just peculiar, but catching scenes of cinematography..such as noir-ish looking cigarette smoke hanging in the air and various camera angles that just lend themselves to the feeling in the film.  The direction on the other hand wasn't nearly as impressive.  It seems as though Harron knows what to do to convey the feeling of the book for like the first 45 minutes, but then it spirals out of control, becoming a (too) dark fall of a yuppie.  It doesn't help that the pacing toward the last 30 minutes is completely off...there is about 15 minutes of monologues about Bateman's flaws, then a horrific murder scene, then close with another 15 minutes of dialogue.  The screenplay, while the pacing was off...the reason why the film's pacing was off, does really do the best possible job of getting the point of the book across, and comes very close to pinning down the exact feeling of the book, except for the self-indulgent finale.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that it is a film that you could probably wait for video or DVD.  But if you are a fanatic of ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" or of the book American Psycho, try to make out to the theatre as soon as possible.<br/><br/>My Rating : 7/10"

","*****Warning contains spoilers********** I saw this last night on showcase expecting it to be a more realistic portrayal of the serial killer / psychopath epoch but instead what we got was a movie which had a surreal / comic book character to it. It is as if the whole movie was a dream. But it wasn't..<br/><br/>I say this for the following reasons:<br/><br/>Bateman's personality was a little to strange for a psychopath. It is as if the director was trying too hard. A little more subtlety would have been better. IE when he has the prostitutes over at his apartment and goes on that monologue about phil collins. Or the parts when he is talking to the investigator and seems visibly disturbed or uneasy, and the detective is completely oblivious. A common misconception is that psychopath is someone who is insane. The only difference between a psychopath and a non-psychopath is that a psychopath does not empathize with other people. Though a lot of them will learn to ""fake it"" over the years. In its extreme case, they will see another person as no different than an object. The part when Bateman made reference to Ed Gaines is a classic: ""Ed Gains would see a girl and think two different things. I can take this girl out and show her a good time, or I can cut her head off"". <br/><br/>The other part I found totally ridiculous, was how Batemen committed all those over the top murders of people and all the other background characters seemed oblivious. Again I think the director was really trying to hard. especially at the end when he kills the old woman, the police officers (which just happened to be parked next to a gas tank which causes a huge explosion!?!? wtf!? ) the guard etc. etc..<br/><br/>I can go on and on about psychopaths, and why it was appropriate for Bateman to be a CEO as research has shown that psychopaths often do well in leadership roles etc. <br/><br/>bottom line, this is a very weak movie with an even weaker ending."

I remember actually owning many of the same CDs as this guy, which is very scary in a way. The song 'hip to be Square' IS very catchy...until the axe is slammed down on Paul's head. I've never heard that song the same way. Anyway, the book was gruesome and hard to read ( I am a writer myself, I don't think i have ever read anything so brutal). I came to the conclusion that Bateman was probably imagining or fantasizing about his crimes, probably jotting them down in a diary...all for fun! I do recall Bret Easton Ellis admitting that the character was fantasizing. 'American Psycho' is a good movie, but you'll never listen to Phil Collins or Huey Lewis in the same way again."

","For most of this film's run, I was in agreement with those who have named this one of the films of the decade. It's just exuberant, hilarious, gripping and spot-on. I'm very vocal in my dislike of Christian Bale's acting style - it feels way too old fashioned to me (if he had been acting in the '50s and '60s, he'd definitely be among the best actors of his time, but nowadays, it just comes off as ridiculously methody), but American Psycho is pitched as a cartoon, and he fits in well. Most of the set-pieces are tremendous, most notably his axe murder set to Huey Lewis' ""Hip to Be Square"". I love every time he goes into the super-long descriptions of the music and artists he's listening to. The problem is, after the climactic sequence, the film takes the kind of twist that was all too prominent between the late '90s and today. Suffice it to say, it's not much more interesting than, ""It was all just a dream"". It flops to the floor like a dead fish and then ends. Definitely disappointing in that way, but I can totally dig the bulk of the movie."
"jaredmobarak","10","2","5","2 August 2008"," I was returning some videotapesAmerican Psycho
","Oh, the 1980's, such happy times. Excess in full force, younger upstart yuppies making money that they could only imagine as children while doing as little work as possible. When did going to lunch, out to dinner at restaurants booked for months in advance, and vying for the biggest ego constitute an occupation worth six figures? Only in America. Bret Easton Ellis' novel was looked upon as very demeaning to women in its portrayal of these masochistic males using their girls as trophies and toys, so who better to adapt and direct a feature of American Psycho than a woman such as Mary Harron. Her film version is a satire on society's fall to materialism and conformity, showing how along with the money and power comes a way of life that is unavoidable. Our lead, Patrick Bateman at one point tells his girlfriend that he is trying to fit in. He is catering to the image of masculinity and success despite his urges to break free into his own lifestyle of gratuitous sex and violence. He says early on that Patrick Bateman doesn't exist, he is an empty face hiding the darkness underneath, the scheming and desire to live on the fringe of society and be able to get away with it amongst the self-absorbed snobs running around blind to anything but themselves.<br/><br/>The story hinges on the devolution of humanity for Bateman as the vapid existence he lives becomes too much to handle. Everything in his world is superficial, from his girlfriend, to his lithium-using mistress, to his meaningless job and his need to look and live better than his peers. One of the best scenes comes from a comparison of business cards and whose is more subtly beautiful due to the whiteness of stock and uniqueness of font. Each card is identical to the layperson, but to these men, obsessed with appearances, they couldn't be more different and inferior. It is such a cookie-cutter lifestyle that no one even knows whom each other is. They will call ""friends"" by the wrong name and then proceed to talk about how much of a reject the person they are actually speaking to is, unknowing they are insulting them to their face. It is one thing to allow the mistakes to happen, it's another to revel in it and pretend to be that other person, because really, what is the difference? Both wear the same suits, have an affinity for the same glasses, and get their hair cut at the same salon.<br/><br/>Because of this duality in identity, Bateman is given a carte blanche to live out his dark fantasies at night. If people think he is someone else when he is raping and murdering people, he is able to live without risk of being caught. Heck, he doesn't even need an alibi because his friends are 100% positive he was out with them the night he was committing heinous crimes. Between the drugs and carbon copy personas, no one knows who they are let alone who they are with. Therefore, Bateman can do whatever he wants, and does. He lives in his own world, waxing pontifically about asinine drivel before going in for the kill.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone could have pulled this role off besides Christian Bale. His demeanor is so likable that no one would think twice about feeling safe with him. As a model he meets and later dispatches says, ""there is something good about you."" Even when in rage, he retains his smile and jovial attitude, praising Phil Collins' talent for bringing Genesis out of their arty funk and Whitney Houston for four of the greatest songs ever written on her album appropriately titled Whitney Houston. The way his delivery makes the most benign topics jump out at you is amazing and when the blood splatters onto his face, you can't help but laugh through the carnage. No other film will make you see the humor in serial killing for sport. All Bateman does is what we fantasize about everyday, breaking free from the monotony and acting on our impulses to punish the stupid and the weak. As he tells a homeless man before killing him, ""why don't you get a job?"" It's the man's negative attitude and laziness that prevents him from succeeding in life. This is a time of self-pride and preservation, albeit an excess of said pride, that allows everyone to look at themselves as God. Even a diatribe about the troubles in South Africa and the US with poverty comes off as staged and humorous. Not because Bateman feels these subject are more relevant than Sri Lanka, but because he really doesn't care about any of it.<br/><br/>Shot beautifully with many static frames focusing on the person's face in action rather than the activity happening around them, American Psycho is gorgeous to behold. The stark sanitation of everything: clean apartments, pristine bodies, and impeccable dressing style counters lovely with the chaos that Bateman brings from his bloodlust.<br/><br/>It is Leto's disappearance that lends to the fact of whether what we see actually happens. Did Bateman kill him and continue with his atrocities afterwards or did Leto really go to London, where people had lunch with him, and the murder was just imagination? No one can ever really know since no character ever knows whom it is they are talking to. Perhaps those who saw Leto really saw others who pretended to be him mistakenly, or maybe he was there still alive and breathing. This is the confusion with insanity and chaos, one can't tell the difference between truth and fiction; the line blurs to infinity. American Psycho could be a tale of the psyche or a story of murderous rage left unchecked, it's really up to you to decide."

"reel_emotion","8","2","5","26 June 2007"," Those Blood-Stained '80s
","Directed by Mary Harron (I Shot Andy Warhol, The Notorious Bettie Page) and based on Bret Easton Ellis' (Less than Zero, The Rules of Attraction) controversial novel, American Psycho follows the antics of stockbroker/serial killer, uber yuppie Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). When watching this movie, you must remove all serious films about serial killers from your mind because American Psycho is a parody of horror movies and a satire about the materialism and shallowness of America during the 1980s. If you can view this as a very dark comedy, it works. <br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is a blank slate of a human being who puts on the mask of being the modern male. He displays all the trappings of what constitutes the successful male in our society: lots of money, lots of women, lots of partying, and lots of toys (i.e., for the '80s, his Walkman, CDs, and, of course, video tapes.) But all the successful male trappings are only Patrick's outfit he wears in society to fit in. The shiny superficiality is reflected in the immaculate white and stainless steel décor of his apartment. The only thing that that makes him human ultimately is his blood lust. When committing his horrendous acts, he breaks through the shiny exterior to the ""meat and bones"" of it all where the deeper meaning might liethat is why when Patrick murders Paul Allen, it so disturbingly satisfying and amusing. After Patrick is done hacking up fellow stockbroker/nemesis Paul Allen (Jared Leto) who keeps confusing him with another stockbroker, he turns, and one side of his face is covered with blood, and the other is not, so you finally see the two sides of Patricka human with some complexity. With all the mistaken identity in the movie among the stockbrokers in their accepted uniform of identical designer haircuts, glasses, suits , and not to mention business cards, Patrick commits suicide in a sense with Paul Allen--murdering himself, and all the artificiality of his lifestyle. <br/><br/>As for the anti-feminist, misogynist criticism that both the book and film received, having Mary Harron as director does bring more of a female sensibility to American Psycho. I don't think a male director could have objectified Christian Bale's body as beautifully as Harron did, especially in the shower and chainsaw scenes. If you look at the female characters, they are quite lost, and that is a commentary on society. Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis), Patrick's mistress, is a high society girl whose only function in life is to take pharmaceutical drugs, and Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), Patrick's fiancée, is a rich Daddy's girl whose only function in life is to shop. On the DVD there is a hilarious deleted scene in which Patrick and Evelyn are in bed, and Patrick strides on top of her, unzipping his pants, while Evelyn looks away at the TV and tries to watch the Home Shopping Network; then she looks up and deadpans, ""What you want me to do with that? Floss with it."" <br/><br/>The most disturbing scenes to me are when Patrick kills the homeless man, the dog and Christie the street prostitute. The homeless man scene is pure camp as Patrick tells him that they have nothing in common. As for the stomping of the dog, it is all implied with sound effects. For a movie that is considered so violent, much of the violence is implied and left up to the mind of the viewers. The chainsaw scene is where the movie uses every cliché in the scary movie business: the madman chasing the woman in jeopardy and bloody corpses popping out of closets. As Patrick wields his chainsaw towards Christie, it becomes more phallicthe chainsaw, the nail gun are all just extensions of his penis, an ironic sign of both power and insecurity. As Christie runs down the stairs, from a top Patrick positions the chainsaws and flings it down the stairwell with perfect aim, piercing her body. After that Patrick becomes an unreliable narrator in the movie, and you wonder if this is real. For some reason, the image of Christie pierced with a chainsaw reminds me of the infamous Hustler cover of the woman being fed through the meat grindera much referred to image by outraged feminists. But as disturbing as both scenes are, both are crucial to the movie's point of being a dark comedy and parody. <br/><br/>Christian Bale (Batman Begins, The Prestige, The New World) will always be remembered for his role of Patrick Bateman. He eats the camera herealthough not literally! Some have thought his acting to be exaggerated, but that is the point: Bale plays someone who must act through his life to achieve his goal of ""fitting in."" Bale's performance also gives a bit of humanity to Patrick, especially during the scene where Jean (Chloe Sevigny), his secretary, is at his apartment. Bale acts charming to Sevigny's obliviousness all the while he looks in his kitchen cabinets full of murdering tools. He aims a nail gun behind Sevigny unbeknownst to her. A comical misunderstanding happens between them as Jean thinks that ""getting hurt"" by Patrick would be by having an affair with him while he knows that it would be killing her. Sadness washes over Bale's face as he tells her that she better go, and, for a second, you see a real person. <br/><br/>American Psycho will not be for everyone, and the ending is cryptic. It doesn't romanticize the '80s, but it captures some of the ugliness of it. The soundtrack is pure guilty pleasure with Katrina and the Waves,Simply Red, The Information Society, New Order, Phil Collins, and Huey Lewis and the News. Bateman spews out little interesting, if somewhat pathetic reviews of these musicians and songs to his victims beforehand. You'll never hear ""Hip to be Square"" or ""Sussudio"" in same way again after watching this movie."
"TrickyTheHorrorFreak","8","2","5","17 September 2006"," Fantastic performance by Christian Bale brings a disturbing character to life.
","""An American Psycho"" is one of those films that people seem to find very difficult to come to grips with. Is it a masterpiece deserving of praise? Is it a completely boring, insensitive piece of sick trash? Or is it something in between? Through all this argument though, there is one thing that cannot be denied. That this film will provoke a reaction from the viewer whether it is feelings of disgust, praise, amusement, unease or all of the above. Well, unless of course the viewer is in a similar state of mind as Patrick Bateman that is.<br/><br/>You see, Patrick Bateman externally appears to be everything a man could want to be. He has a body to die for, a big earning job and all the worldly possessions that come with the territory. Yet despite all this, Patrick finds it difficult to feel anything. He states in the film that he feels no human emotions other than ""greed and disgust"" and it's this complete lack of connection with the world that drives him to violence. However, even these extreme outbursts of gruesome bloodshed still can't make him feel anything but empty and only distance him further from humanity, driving him towards madness.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's performance as Patrick is simply stunning. He fills the character with humour, anger, charm, intelligence and copious amounts of vanity. Christian makes even the strangest of scenarios in Patrick's existence appear to be completely realistic for him. An example of such bizarre behaviour is the way he verbally critiques Huey Lewis and the News while murdering a colleague. Or when he decides another colleague should die for the simple fact that they now have a better business card than he does. These occurrences are as funny as they are unsettling but never unintentionally so. The direction is perfectly understated and considering the extreme nature of the book it is based on, the screenplay is as loyal as decency (amongst the general movie going population anyway) and budget would allow. I should point out though that I have not yet read the book and this review is based only on the movie itself and not the quality of the adaptation.<br/><br/>""An American Psycho"" is not for the faint of heart and yet there essentially isn't all that much on-screen gore. Not to say that killing people with chainsaws and axes isn't gory, only that these brutal acts of slaughter are mostly either only suggested or just out of the cameras view. But more than the acts themselves, many viewers will find the nonchalant, motiveless way in which Patrick conducts them far more disturbing, not to mention his degrading use of women as self gratifying objects.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoy this movie. Despite all the disconcerting aspects of the story it remains an entertaining film and multiple viewings have definitely been rewarding. The only way in which I feel this film is not a complete success is in the ambiguousness of its final moments. Although it certainly makes a great discussion point post viewing, I can't help but feel it to be frustrating and slightly unnecessary. I have my views on what it all means, but I won't mention them here as I don't want to ruin things for those that haven't seen the movie yet. Besides, I have to return some video tapes."

","Novel adaptation ""American Psycho"" is a fiercely comical, graphic, dark, and relevant satire directing blunt social criticism toward the perverse materialism in America in the 1980s, the soullessness of rich people and the lack of individualism among an entire generation of yuppies. Think it's too much to take? It isn't, as the film balances its dark themes with huge doses of well-placed comedy. We follow Patrick Bateman, superbly acted by Christian Bale, as a well-to-do Wall Street worker, Harvard graduate and killer sociopath at night.<br/><br/>Director Mary Harron has bravely steered American Psycho away from a slasher horror path and zooms in more on the psyche of Patrick Bateman and his hatred for other people which for the most part is covered in a mask of sanity but which sometimes slips out and results in gory killing sprees in his apartment.<br/><br/>American Psycho is an elegantly crafted thriller, making great use of high-praised art, vulgar fashion trends, refined decoration, luxurious food and expensive New York living -- all to illustrate the materialism of our time. This makes Patrick Bateman something of a modern day Gatsby, but with a morbid twist and complete lack of morals. This is a modern masterpiece, if faintly flawed -- mostly because it does not leave much feeling. The entire film is very detached since we follow a cruel, emotionless anti-hero and pointing to the hollowness of an entire generation, the film itself becomes a bit hollow.<br/><br/>8/10"
"plu4085","8","2","5","22 September 2004"," Not as good as the novel, but still...
","*** Some minor spoilers below ***<br/><br/>I'm a great fan of Ellis' novel, which I recently re-read, and after seeing the movie adaptation for a 2nd time recently, here are some thoughts.<br/><br/>The movie's main problem is that it seems to lack a bit of self-confidence; both in direction and script. It does seem to want to take Ellis' labyrinthine, non-linear (except for sheer chronology) work and turn it into a ""normal"" 90-minute movie with a beginning, middle & end. Yet it doesn't go all the way there either, which would have required substantial overhaul of the whole storyline and characters. Instead it's a middle route that selects choice material from the novel, and expands some angles to create a narrative arch -- the latter being most obvious in the much expanded part for Detective Kimball, vs the novel where his part barely exists. Unfortunately, Bateman's psychological complex is so vast that it cannot be squeezed into a story about a psychopath scared of getting caught.<br/><br/>While Ellis never fully explains what Bateman is about, he says so much about him in the novel that you feel that it's as close as we're going to get. In the movie OTOH, Bateman is still enigmatic, but with a feel of simplification. On the first view I remember thinking that the movie was too short, and that it had been brutally edited, but on the 2nd time round I see it more as an effect of the choice made for the presentation of Bateman. It may work better if you haven't read the novel, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>OK, on the plus side: Christian Bale does a terrific job, with lots of work put into it. He has developed a whole set of deliberately artificial faces which help illustrate the emptiness of Bateman's inner life. His voice is terrific, and manages to convey contempt and hate even while the face is looking jovial. He's good in the ""horror"" segments too, truly primitive and more real, as he should be. Very good casting, and an excellent, unusual performance.<br/><br/>The clothes, the hairstyles, the restaurants etc, all look much like they appear in Ellis' novel. I miss the hilarious rundowns of what people are wearing (the single most notable feature of the novel on the first read), but they look right and it's no great loss. Bale in particular is extremely well dressed, even for a ""Wall Street"" movie, like he should be. His apartment, and Owen's/Allen's look just right too.<br/><br/>One case where I think the movie is *superior* to the novel is in the portrayal of Bateman's female friends, Evelyn and Courtney. In the novel they never become more than shadow creatures, interchangeable despite appearing on many dozens of pages. Thanks to great casting and well-written parts, both Reese Witherspoon and Samanta Mathis manage to give these rich-but-messed up ladies true identities. Bateman's secretary's part is much like the novel, though I think Chloe Sevigny overacts slightly in her mousiness. Another element where the movie may surpass the novel is near the end at the club, where Bateman confronts the lawyer with his confession -- this is a scene that works better as film than literature, and the movie exploits it brilliantly. <br/><br/>Some more complaints: the Kimball cop-hunt angle doesn't really work as stated above, and I also think the gay love angle of Luis Carruthers (which is pretty effective in the novel) becomes meaningless in this drastically shortened version. The part with Christie being chased and having a chainsaw dropped on her is NOT in the novel, and seems wrong for Bateman, who thrives on physical *closeness* to his victims -- this was a real mistake in the script, IMO, esp in such a crucial scene.<br/><br/>All over, the movie is complex and challenging, just like the novel, which is obviously very difficult to adapt. I don't think it holds a candle to Ellis' work, but I still enjoy seeing it. The second half in particular is strong, with the director finding her stride and Bale's carefully developed Bateman fitting in just right."

","American PSYCHO (2000) **** Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Theroux, Matt Ross, Cara Seymour, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage, Guinevere Turner. Filmmaker Mary Harron attempts the impossible: adapting, with co-scribe Turner, Bret Easton Ellis' controversial blood-drenched satirical 1991 novel with surprising success. Instead of relying on the ghastly acts as the focal point in diluting the gore factor (the audience must fill in the blanks for each act not unlike the original 'Psycho') she instead makes Patrick Bateman – Jack The Ripper in Armani - (Bale in a mesmerizing, darkly funny turn) a hypnotically scary 'merger and acquisitions' (or is that 'murder and executions'?) Wall Street proto-yuppie living large in the late Reagan Eighties to the extreme and caving in to his inner voices by killing at random with elan and irony tongue-through-cheek (trust me you'll never hear Huey Lewis and The News' 'Hip To Be Square' in quite the same way) aplomb. Dare I compare him to 'A Clockwork Orange's Alex? Sure, he's just as maladjusted but not so much at blaming society, although the film does underscore throughout the absurdities of class warfare and contemporary thrillseeking (extreme sports being who has the better looking business card) forsaking identity, which is the key point here even if it means splitting a skull with an axe every now and then.

","WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>I first read Ellis' novel a year ago.  While much of it was overwritten, particularly the gore parts, within it was a biting yet chilling satire, from the concentration of what Patrick wore to what he listened to(the record reviews, written with the same depth as one might expect a review of The Who's TOMMY would have, are hysterical), which exposed an entire empty sub-culture.  I'm glad director and co-writer(with Guinevere Turner, who also plays one of Patrick's victims) Mary Harron found that satire in her film, while playing down the gore(though the murders still retain their kick).  One could argue some of it is so 80's it's passe, but then again, given the way a new generation of people are driven to success at any cost, maybe it's not just the 80's.<br/><br/>Bale does a good job of capturing Patrick, being both funny and terrifying, often at the same time, and yet showing that the person he most terrifies is himself.  The other actors are all good, particularly Chloe Sevigny as Patrick's secretary, and makes it believable that she's the one person he would spare.  A couple of points on what people have written; if the other characters seem shallow, that's partly because that's how Patrick sees them. Also, I don't think we're supposed to think he imagined it all; I think his friends just don't believe a serial killer may be in their midst(which is why Harron keeps Ellis' last line ""THIS IS NOT AN EXIT"" on the door behind Patrick)."
"bregund","2","3","10","23 February 2003"," As empty as the era it ridicules
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't know what it wants to be.  It's too serious to be a black comedy, too gruesome to be a comedy, too funny to be a drama, too narrow-mined to be satirical, and too broad to be a character study.  In short, American Psycho takes the middle road so often that the end result is a weak, ineffectual film that promises more than it delivers.<br/><br/>Just in case you don't know that this film takes place in greed-driven 1980s (oh right, like the 1990s internet explosion had nothing to do with greed), gigantic cordless phones, 1980s music, power suits, whitewashed Malibu walls, and odd menu choices like `sea urchin ceviche' are jammed into your senses.  With all of these blatant era-placement devices, you just know that during the writing of the script someone must have quipped about `instant culture immersion via baseball bat.'  I'm surprised they didn't stick a Neiman poster on the wall.  By the way, why aren't any of the women actors wearing those huge shoulder pads that were so popular in the 1980s? <br/><br/>
Christian Bale, as the yuppie Patrick Bateman, is pretty good in this otherwise vapid film.  The men are broadly-painted cliches of the typical 1980s ivy-league archetype:  snotty and oily-haired, with mannerisms akin to those of car salesmen or insurance agents, engaged in a culture of their own that we as viewers are supposed to ridicule, not just because it is the 1980s but because they were born priveleged, have nicknames like `Biff', and will someday die not in a smelly hospital but in the comfort of their own home on a four-hundred-year-old poster bed attended to by a private nurse.<br/><br/>Several things don't make sense:  when the prostitute ran screaming down the hall, pounding on doors, why didn't any of the residents open their doors? Why don't we ever see Bateman doing any work instead of just listening to music or going to lunch?  How could you kill someone with a nail gun?  And just what happened at the end, was Paul Allen alive or dead?  I don't understand this film at all.<br/><br/>This film is as pretty and sterile as Patrick Bateman's condo, and, like much of the 1980s, offers little substance."

Now you may say ""do we have to categorize it?"" Of course, not. But all those elements are so disconnected from one another that they seem out of place. A good-looking killer without a motive. And I still do not know why I was not scared even a bit by the murder scenes. He likes 80s music specially Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the news. Unfortunately, all these things fail to come together to make meaningful whole. Was the purpose of the movie to create an irony by trying to make a picture with all these irrelevant traits?

And, let's face facts here, the main character is a very, very stupid, boring, and pathetic man, who just happens to have violent fantasies and sleep around.  Most of the violence in the movie was off-camera, so I can't say it was really too graphic.  This is a really hard movie to pin down, because you know it is a satire, but there's no humor.

"FlickJunkie-2","4","2","6","9 September 2000"," A Directorial Hack Job
","Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits. `American Psycho' is a satirical horror film that had greater potential than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.<br/><br/>The film would have benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life. The story presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about the people he was killing or the acts themselves.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the killings were sloppily done.  In most cases it is inconceivable that he wouldn't have been immediately apprehended based on all the forensic evidence he was leaving behind.  This is the director's way of giving us a not so subtle push as to how to interpret the ending.  If the killings were masterfully planned and executed, the ending would have been much more perplexing and effective.  <br/><br/>The acting by Bale was excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous and supercilious than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.<br/><br/>Overall, the way the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the characters and their behavior, which took the effectiveness out of the psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct possibility."
"alice liddell","3","2","6","7 June 2000"," Pretty much as you'd expect.
","If you were to make a satire of the American 80s, that infamous, hollow, bombastic, ultra-materialist, cruel decade, how would you do it?  Would you have a male hero, in this decade of Rambo, Arnie and Gordon Gekko, where even women wanted to be men?  Would you fetishise minimalism - elaborately tiny meals; shiny apartments with hardly any furniture etc. - to emphasise the spiritual emptiness of the decade?  Would you foreground the most ghastly, soulless, manufactured music to demonstrate the assembly-line reduction of emotions?  Would you mock the obsession with restaurants, big suits, vanity products, the mimicking of a 20s aristocracy sieved of all Gatsbyesque romance; where new, utility products don't make life easier, but serve to alienate you further from you 'loved' ones, your peers, your surroundings?  Would you show how, beneath the civilised sheen, the most barbaric ritual rites retain (and I'm not just talking about the serial killing)?  Would your hero be so obsessed with appearance, image (lots of mirrors and reflections), fitting in, that he would cease to be himself, that he would be alienated from himself, that he would become a literal double of himself with nothing inside?  Would you show the abuse of marginal figures such as the homeless?  Would you compare all this to the obscenities of the Reagan era?<br/><br/>Sounds easy, doesn't it?  And that, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, is the problem with AMERICAN PSYCHO - it goes for the easy option every time.  It is no excuse to argue that the film is thin and superficial, that its satire is far too broad, because so was the decade.  By making this American psycho so ridiculous, so harmlessly, buffoonishly camp; by making the kind of emasculated satirical swipes a Republican might enjoy; only evades the true moral decadence of the era.<br/><br/>The device of suggesting that everything that Bateman does is a mere projection of his fantasies, in the way the whole decade was a paralysing projection of materialist fantasies, goes back at least as far as LAURA, but whereas that classic tried to deconstruct the image of the police detective, and the very real authority invested in him, Bateman is just a dork, as everyone says.  He is too silly to be scary, his social position isn't adequately delineated to make him powerful.<br/><br/>This in itself is satirical - what DOES Bateman do to make so much money? Is he really daddy's boy, or just another wannabe vice-president among dozens?  Why does he pick his particular victims?  In Paul Allen's case it's clear enough, immature envy.  But why prostitutes and the homeless (echoes of Bunuel, Kubrick, Ferrera)?  Because they refuse to conform to the glorious 80s ethic, they don't want to fit in like he does, they give the lie to his era's self-confidence?  Because they exist on the margin, as he would truly like to?  But he is as 'unproductive' and marginal as they are. Donald Kimball is set up as some kind of doppelganger (the film seems very indebted to Poe; or is this a nod to 80s academic theory?), but this kind of disintegrates as the plot breaks down, presumably to mirror its protagonists increasing madness.<br/><br/>The style is as anonymous as its subject - again, correspondence between form and content isn't really enough; CLAIRE DOLAN has shown how the evocation of a soulless environment can be made critically meaningful. The lack of budget deadens the impact of the action hero climax.  If the film has a saving grace, it is the performance of Christian Bale, effecting, for some reason, an excellent impression of Jim Carrey, doing what he can to wring laughs from the predictable material (the BEN-HUR-like threesome is hilarious).  I watched DRILLER KILLER after this, a real American psycho whose trauma is rooted in an emotional crisis Bateman can never have because he is, as he says, a cipher."

I think that herron was trying to say that if we allow ourselves the opportunity to get lost in our identity (in this case the loss of identity is through mid eighties commercialism) then we lose hold of our perceptions of reality. Patrick bateman had become a product of this culture that promotes the idea that your identity can be reduced to your business card. once he had fallen into this state of faceless day to day doldrums where none of the people in a circle of friends can tell each other apart, he lost control over himself, and started to release himself through remorseless killings. only the thing is, just like the rest of his life, it was all a charade. patrick bateman wasn't actually killing people, it was just his way of releasing, and it turned to unbelievable preportions. do you actually think that he really shot two police cars untill they exploded, and then was chased into a high rise by a police helicopter, only to be walking around in public the very next day? comeon."

"r-57117","8","1","2","24 January 2020"," American Psycho Review
","The film American Psycho, which was directed by Mary Harron, focuses on the life of the character of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bateman is a wealthy vice president of an investment bank on Wall Street, who is also an unknown serial killer to others. He and the people in his wealthy inner circle mainly focus on the materialistic things in life, such as exclusive dinner reservations, expensive clothing, and the status of their business cards. Patrick Bateman has urges to murder innocent people for little to no reason, which leads to him going on a killing spree throughout New York city. He confesses these murders to his lawyer, Harold Carnes, but the confession is not taken seriously and his lawyer acts like nothing happened.
Christian Bale does a great job of fulfilling the role of Patrick Bateman, expressing a wide range of multiple different personalities and ultimately acting as a ""psycho"". The way the film was shot and composed presents the story and characters in an anticipating way, wanting to know what will happen next. Most of the different camera shots made sense for each scene, including the main focus of the subject(s). The transitions between sequences are smooth and often include music that would either counter or compliment the theme of the upcoming scenes. Dark and slow paced scenes were used to create suspense and give the viewer a feeling of fear based on the vengeful acts of Patrick Bateman. The dialogue between most of the characters is shallow and concise, but gives enough detail to continue the story. The way that the script was written helps support the different sides and personalities Bateman has, such as in one scene, he was talking to his colleagues and seemed to be acting normal, but after they were showing their business cards he had a short temper and walked out. The actors and script also give a sense of the other characters and their personalities. The other main actors, such as the characters in Bateman's inner circle, give us the sense of actually listening to a conversation between wealthy New York businessmen. Including the actors and script, the composition of the scenes are very detailed and set with a specific vision to follow the plot. In comparison, the film Scream directed by Wes Craven, gives the feeling of horror and fear as well as American Psycho, although it is easier to realize it is fiction. The way that American Psycho gives more of a realism factor is based on the plot of a wealthy businessman living in New York City, it is not expected for someone matching this description to be a serial killer.
Overall, the film American Psycho is a movie that I would watch again at some point. The plot is interesting and maintains focus throughout, with senses of humor, fear and anticipation. The composition of the visuals is also an important and impressive part of this film, maintaining interest and entertainment during the whole duration of the film. The direction of Mary Harron was very thought out and brings the story and plot of the film to life."

There is no subtlety at all. The writers continually force down your throat that this movie takes place in the 1980's in a very inorganic way. It's like ""Yep, we get it already, you've proven your knowledge of 80's pop music."" It's not only Bale's character that's unbelievable, it's every character. Nothing rings true. It's as if the writers and actors had heard stories about the 80's but never lived through those years and are putting on some grade school production. You can skip this one."

"adamafrixal","8","1","2","10 October 2018"," American Psycho (2000) : Twisted Mind or Twisted Reality?
","Really, I have no high expectation for this movie when I watched it and just go for it because it was Christian Bale playing Bateman before Batman (get it? Such bad joke). I found myself surprised at the interesting plot twist and intense moment the movie managed to portray even under normal conversation in the office.
American Psycho tells the story of seemingly perfect young man named Patrick bateman played by Christian Bale. He seems like the perfect young man, which have his life managed, but seems to have controlling tendencies, perfectionist to the extreme and can look like a freak at times.
I think the story exert the tale of control over one self and hidden story every people have behind their faÃ§ade to ""fit in"" in life. I personally hate the affair thing, but they are all jackass and rude in their own way. They love to compete over simplest thing in the office from clothing, reservation at dorsia, Work performance even business card.
Patrick Bateman seems disconnected from people, and seems like a sore loser. Overly competitive and killing he deemed unworthy without batting an eye or anyone he felt threatening to his presence. Such as a hobo, and Allen Paul. He wanted to be different and be special in a sea of people with similar attributes and quality in this world. However, he did it by becoming a psychopathic killer.
The story really takes a nice turn when his killing tendencies are started to be unraveled by the appearance of Detective Donald Kimball played by William Dafoe who have been hired to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. Patrick felt his reality threatened and become more and more unstable with time. Thus, he cannot accept to continue his usual life and killing habit. Moreover, in the end it is questionable whether he is mental that cannot accept reality or he now accept that he is living in a twisted reality with lack of empathy within the people.
There are so much things to learn from the movies, and I believe I understand the mind of people better, and how our society are shaped and how twisted it can be. A fun twisted and confusing ride from start to finish. I rate it 8/10."
"bazookamouth-221-898097","8","1","2","19 September 2018"," Christian Bale acting masterclass
","A brief adaptation of the book is a comic turn, and partly because the serial killer has become one of the cinema's stock characters this past decade. Bateman was clearly named to echo America's most famous movie psycho, Norman Bates, but the characters he most resembles are those more recent sociopathic figures fleeing from or attracted to the upper middle-class high life played by Edward Norton in Fight Club, Jude Law and Matt Damon in The Talented Mr Ripley, and Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. <br/><br/>American Psycho is a shallow movie, as two-dimensional as its hero, though in a performance that is convincingly American, eerily disturbing and edgily comic, Christian Bale brings Bateman to life."

"aleccmax","10","1","2","28 August 2017"," A Work of Art
","Scrolling through the 1 star reviews in this 'user reviews' section is arguably the most frustrating thing I've ever encountered because their reviews and unfair ratings are often looked at legitimate reasons for not enjoying this film. That being said, this film is not for everyone and has to be understood that it is not a typical horror flick but it is actually a social commentary to the extreme. That is the most important thing to understand in order to understand the brilliance of the circumstances and the characters and the dialogue that is in the show.<br/><br/>For sake of brevity, I do not intend to write about every scene and not even necessarily the best scenes but I will be going in depth with examples.<br/><br/>Generally there are certain aspects of a film that I look for when giving them a review. For starters I look at the most obvious, the plot. The plot is arguably the most important part of the film. This movie is a film about a young 1980's Wall Street executive who moonlights as a serial killer and a womanizer. Understanding that this is a criticism of 1980's Wall Street, each of the scenes has to be fine tuned to show the different social aspects of the lives of those executives and how significant appearance (inside doesn't matter) is. The film opens on a scene in a high class restaurant. Now this film has been criticized for being an over the top depiction of the singularity in culture during that time but I believe it perfectly. It slowly moves into a more direct viewership of the scene where two waiters are shown at two different tables introducing the night's specials. They are clearly different people (one is black, one is white, one is thin and one is chubbier) but they both speak in the same tone of voice and accent and say the same thing in the same way. Then you are introduced to the main characters of the movie who are all sitting together at a table. The values of each of the characters are shown during a brief exchange and also notes the rampant drug problem and how luxurious and expensive things were with ""Speaking of reasonable, only $570"" when the check came.<br/><br/>Then the movie goes in deeper with Bateman's morning routine. He introduces it through a narration as we watch him complete the steps. It is important to note the regimented nature of his routine and how much of a process he feels he needs to go through in order to keep his appearance up. It also reveals an inner aspect of his character that even though he appears to be normal and similar to everyone else, he simply does not feel anything for the people that surround him.<br/><br/>The next scene addresses the rampant sexism that occurred. Usually women were in secretarial positions or simply marrying into money and that is exactly what is addressed in the exchange between Jean and Bateman. She tells him he looks nice and he tries to tell her what to wear so she'll look prettier. In the following scene his fiancé is ""buzzing off in his ear"" about their wedding that he does not seem to care about almost making it seem like it was entirely based on appearances or frankly even arranged.<br/><br/>The movie is frequently criticizing the singularity of 1980's Wall Street culture and there are many examples of this throughout the movie. For example when he finds the empty apartment where he had a bunch of dead bodies he found it white and with painting gear still there as if there was a quick cover-up. Now obviously this is an exaggeration of actions taken but why would anyone want Upper class culture to be tarnished by the discovery a serial killer and property values in a building overlooking the park would drop significantly. It all hints towards the concept that ""inside doesn't matter"" to people.<br/><br/>The sheer brilliance of the characters is also shown throughout the film and even though Bale practically makes the movie with his character, how other people react to his antics is essential and really an under-appreciated aspect of this film. The directing is also necessary to this as Harron pointed the cameras at what she thought was necessary and it was not always the person that was talking. She often provided a contrast between other characters and Bateman by showing over the shoulder shots of how they reacted to his catch phrases and general disposition.<br/><br/>The acting was also spectacular where in many snapshots of the film, you can see genuine emotion, the best example after he takes the first swing at Allen and brings up the ax for the next you can see genuine hatred and anger in his face.<br/><br/>The score was also great in every scene and really set the tone. The most notable aspect was you would hear a sound of tension every time there was something that angered Bateman<br/><br/>I wish I had more space to write more about this film but I do not. It is a work of sheer brilliance and a personal favorite and the ratings from people that expected a slasher flick are not fair to the actual quality of this film. It is constantly excellent from scene to scene and you never catch a break from something that's funny or interesting or just generally important to the story."
"christopher-underwood","8","1","2","17 August 2017"," even the really bad 80s music fits in
","Loved the book, which I remember recommending to many but I recall being disappointed with the film. Now with memory of both rather faded, another look. It is a hard film to 'like' as the events and characters all seem to be horrible. And I mean the obsession with getting reservations for crazy restaurants serving crazy foods covered with scribbled sauces. The obsession for clothes and even personal cards and the variations of colour and embossing. All this is terrible enough never mind the grim killings and the increasingly confusing happenings as we begin to doubt what is being presented to us. Is Bale being evasive or is there something else going on, or not going on, more to the point? On balance and with the benefit of distance from those mad Wall Street days, this takes on the air of a decent satire of the times, when human life itself seemed less important than some statement suit or signature dish. And then the are the drugs. In truth its a wonder with all the money sloshing around and all the drugs being consumed that more people didn't get really, really confused as to what was real and what wasn't. Great looking film and even the really bad 80s music fits in to help this insanity keep rolling till the end."
"danny-852-356356","10","1","2","1 June 2017"," An explained look into the deeper messages from American Psycho
","American Psycho follows a businessman called Patrick Bateman who has the ""American Dream"" – he's good-looking, has a good body, and very wealthy, and so on. He indulges, bit by bit, in murdering people with no remorse or emotions. He describes himself as not having a ""single, clear, identifiable emotion"". Did Patrick Bateman really kill all these people or was it a dream or a fantasy of his? You could argue it was a fantasy as a lot of his killings were unrealistic and a lot of scenes were surreal. In my opinion, it really doesn't matter. What matters is that the reason Patrick Bateman killed people was to have a unique identity, to make himself as noticeable as possible to people, even if it was to the extremes of the most ultra violent murders possible. But why did Patrick Bateman want to put his identity out there to others? I interpret this film's theme to be the criticism of how self-obsessed everybody is in society to care about anybody else. The only things people really cared about in American Psycho were the most insignificantly mundane details of life – the ties, the business cards, the reservations made for dinner. All businessmen were practically the same, their only difference in identity being their ties. As all identities were the same, dull and forgotten, Patrick wanted to make himself noticeable to society. Throughout the film, he'd say crazy things straight up to people's faces such as ""I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?"" and ""I want to stab you to death, and then play around with your blood"". Yet people would either change the subject to something completely insignificant or simply ignore him – or think he's just joking. There was a scene where his victim was screaming and pounding at doors, and moments later Patrick ran after her naked, revving his chainsaw as loud as possible before killing her, and satirically, no one called anyone or did anything, as everyone was too immersed in their own lives. When Patrick had enough and began to kill anyone and a lot of people on the streets with a gun, and confessed everything he had done to his lawyer, not only had he gotten away with it but his lawyer thought it was all a large joke. The logical reason his lawyer found it as a joke was because Patrick said he killed Paul Allen, and Patrick's lawyer had recently met Paul Allen, meaning Paul was alive. This explains that all people's identities were meaningless and merged in with each other, and Patrick mistook Paul's identity for another businessman. In fact, identities are swapped throughout the movie. Patrick's murdering side is trying to stand out in society by any means possible – ironically, his other ""sane"" side is exactly what his ""insane"" side tries to destroy – his sane side is narcissistic and ignorantly self-obsessed. He takes careful measures to working out and putting a face mask on himself that represents his sanity. Beneath it he is flawed, and he must feel flawless. And when making love, he flexes in the mirror and winks at himself. His sane side represents everyone else around him. But his insane side, along with its ultra violence, wants to break out from a mundane life and have a noticed identity that's unique to all others, despite how no-one seems to notice anyhow. Wrapped up, Patrick Bateman has supposed schizophrenia – but what are the deeper thoughts to his charismatic businessman side and his psychotic murdering side? His charismatic side is the identity in which he forces himself to blend in to society, however his darker side is simply trying to do the opposite – make his identity stand out in society. But his identity isn't noticed, and as it doesn't work, Patrick becomes more and more frustrated, committing more and more murders, then cannibalising, then openly murdering people on the street, before confessing everything to his lawyer. But still, people either think he's joking or choose to ignore him, highlighting the ignorant narcissism of humanity in today's world. This is shown in Bateman's last words in the film, which are ""No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing."""
"jhnachos","10","1","2","15 March 2017"," A character study like no other
","Where do I start with American Psycho. This film is a classic and should be remember for solely for the character of Patrick Bateman. Christian Bale gives one of the best performances I have ever seen. He grabs your attention and sucks you in to this universe. His line delivery is fantastic and while the magnificent screenplay helps, Bale instantly makes the character his own and commands the screen, despite other strong performances. The direction and cinematography are great, but clearly the focus of the film goes to the riveting Patrick Bateman. Every line that Bale says becomes iconic and it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Overall American Psycho is masterful character study with strong, performances direction, cinematography and a flawless script. Bale delivers a performance that might upset some people based on how distributing he can be, but if look hard enough, you will see that American Psycho is a movie like no other."

","for a fan of Christian Bale, American Psycho is a real challenge. because his Paul Bateman seems be perfect. the mixture of cold cruelty, dark humor, the violence as error, the fall and the cynical speeches, the spirit of novel who becomes large, dark shadow who defines as parable the every day events, the almighty monster who is so vulnerable than the compassion of the viewer becomes , scene by scene, more deep, the sex scenes who are memorable, the run from himself in the cage of appearances, all is seductive, strange and bizarre . and convincing because it is only portrait of social crisis who defines us. a film who could be useful for discover the dark side from yourself. and an admirable Christian Bale's job."
"milogold13","7","1","2","10 January 2016"," A great film, that should've been better.
","A fantastic roller-coaster of thrill and hilarity, American Psycho pulls you in to the twisted insanity that is the brain of psychopath Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale). Perhaps considered a staple of the serial killer genre, this film is a great example of good cinema although unfortunately finds itself dragged down by its overly ambiguous and muddled ending. I felt as if I was cheated of giving this movie an extra star (8/10) and so nearly did, however the ending cast such a shadow over the film due to its poor execution that I couldn't bring myself to look past it, which is unfortunate because the ending could have been handled so much better but felt lazy in some ways.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's performance is magnificent, leading a one man show for much of the film, whilst other performances were at times questionable to say the least. To successfully pull off a character who has an inability to portray characteristics and still have the audience feel empathy for the character, albeit accompanied by being terrified of him, is a difficult feat and Bale certainly does pull it off. Some scenes throughout the film felt misplaced, especially towards the start, although when the ball got rolling it felt as if the picture reached out and threw you into the world and mind of Patrick Bateman with a one way ticket to wherever he is taking you. I certainly felt sucked into the film at that point and I feel as if this movie does a great job at doing exactly that, even throughout the majority of the muddled closing sequence. <br/><br/>In summary, American Psycho is an oddly enjoyable film, from Patrick Bateman's satirical monologues throughout, to the terrifying gruesome yet epic violence, this film had the recipe to be a great; however the end product is more a sponge cake than a black forest gateau, but what a incredible sponge it is!"
"naysbaghai","9","1","2","12 December 2015"," Unearthly brutal and outright confronting
","2000 is commonly regarded as one of the best years in cinema, but none of the films that year were as unearthly brutal and outright confronting as the hybrid opus American Psycho. Predominantly constructed as a psychological thriller, this film should rank high on anyone's ""most disturbing"" film list, but as a reviewer, my catharsis from such unsettling sights was the breadth in technique and execution.<br/><br/>The opening credits exhibit what separates good opening titles from great ones, and that is the usage of foreshadowing. Everything, from the exquisite dishes to the slashing knife, and even the elegant font, is representative of the future events in the film. As an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, the poetic passages and smooth dialogue are effortlessly translated onto film, further signifying Mary Hellon's subtlety and neutrality in her direction. Her clinical style of direction is particularly showcased when she edits Detective Kimball's interview scene from various performance takes to deliberately confuse audiences in regards to Kimball's thoughts.<br/><br/>The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast featuring Willem Defoe, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon and Justin Theroux. As talented as all the actors in the film are, none hold up to the irrepressible Christian Bale, whose penchant for method acting is in full blossom. By spending hours in the gym and maintaining an American accent, he truly does morph into the role of a truly twisted and sick son of a bitch. He is flanked by symbols such as cigars, expensive materials and facial masks, highlighting the film's smart investigation into the hedonistic upper class. American Psycho is undoubtedly objective and cold, and forces the audience to decide on their own personal views of the human world.<br/><br/>A large percentage of the film's budget is devoted to a soundtrack full of classic 80s hits, like Walking On Sunshine, Simply Irresistible and Lady In Red. Ultimately, the most iconic usage of music in this film is when Hip To Be Square, by Huey Lewis and the News, is cranked up as Bateman viciously murders Paul Allen with a fire axe. As a film addict, I realised how the sign of a good movie is when it synchronises a famous piece of music to the scene, and perpetually associates the two in your synapses. Speaking of which, Bateman's behaviour and violence is enormously disturbing, and is the primary reason why American Psycho is really only for adults. I learned that a sign of adulthood is not the tolerance of an R18+ movie, but rather the bravery to object to senseless violence. It's hard not to be enticed by the techniques and performances, but if you find yourself undisturbed by the content of this film, then, to quote Reese Witherspoon's character, ""you're inhuman""."

","American psycho: what a well-aimed title for film! This film does not concern at all the history of PatrickBaitman, a perverted person at most of you. Patrick is narcissists and is becoming o a symbol of all humans. Really , how many from you have not thought the same for their competitors. Simply into this point enters the mental factor that appears in the film in order not to misunderstand the director. Patrick stops acting like a person but behaves as an animal, he tries to exterminates his enemies and he dominates. Patrick is above everyone. Money determines the relations of persons in this film. The Film moves between fantastic and real.The director excellently has attributed fiction verisimilitude<br/><br/>while we are watching the conflicts that happen in our hero: leave his instincts to guide him or to rein? The more times first predominates but with Liz didn't kill her . Sadistis and schizophrenic is Patrick no because ''kills'' in his manner women but because he imagines that really kill them. The film remained in the middle because the thoughts will not be late becomes action! However Patrick isn't like the other murderers who have sense what they do. Tragic is that he does not have sense of his actions. he imagines what would want him shelf to become but alas social reality bounds him, he feels oppressed and the imagination is the best medicine in these circumstances, however his imagination is sick or no? Maybe he is afraid to know the true love and resorts to the market love? Or he just abominated his girl because she blatantly showed that she had relation with other man and in consequence he adopts such a behavior of the women? It is a film very searched, See it!"
"Semisonic","8","1","2","31 July 2015"," A Clockwork Orange of the noughties
","It's the 80's outside, and it looks like Patrick Bateman is living a true American dream: a job of an investment banker, a pitch-perfect physical shape, a pack of high-status jock friends and a hot fiancée. But is he really? Because behind this mask of success there are real demons, skeletons in the closet and heads in the freezer.<br/><br/>To some adepts of Stanley Kubrick, even comparing their beloved masterpiece to anything else would be a sacrilege. But those films are indeed strangely similar. Even though the former bathes in a cosmopolitan decadence and preaches about a conflict between a citizen and a state, while the latter is more about an American mission of the world's guardian and a conflict between a person and a society. But both of these films choose a very peculiar means of delivering their messages - a sheer and unobscured violence, gore and sexual narcissism.<br/><br/>To be honest, A Clockwork Orange didn't work for me. Partly because it lost most of its shocking charge over the decades, and the scenes that must've been extra provocative in the 70's are now nothing too special. But it's not just that. The main character of the movie was always just a part of a bigger system, something he might have loathed but at the same time would've been helpless and even pointless without, like a fish without water. Which makes the overall drama less intense and more like a sketch from a regular ""homo homini lupus est"" life.<br/><br/>In American Psycho however, the drama resides within a single man, in his life and (or maybe it would be better to say ""or"") in his head. Patrick Bateman tries his hardest pretending to be a normal fish, but he's already suffocating in the poisonous pond of his life, and nothing, even the drastic measures, can help him truly embrace it and feel fulfilled.<br/><br/>Maybe this concept works better because, unlike a bizarre and rather dystopian world of A Clockwork Orange nobody could imagine living in, American Psycho shows us a very believable image of an American upper class citizen's life. So believable that Patrick Bateman could easily be neighbors with Bud Fox from Wall Street. Which only makes it even more shocking to see how different are the things those seemingly similar people do behind the closed doors of their vast apartments.<br/><br/>One could not talk about this film and not mention Christian Bale's performance. We all know him as a versatile actor capable of doing extraordinary things to make a bang out of his roles, and if you doubt that then simply look up that pic with a chart of weight changes he made himself go through in order to fit into his roles. Yet this time it's not just the weight. It's that unabated self-adoration and self-loathing. Separately those things had been done a million times, and i could probably recall Philip Seymour Hoffman being natural doing each of them for various roles, but i have yet to see a better display of a character showing them both at the same time. Still, such brilliance has its drawbacks. Because, even cast along with such heavyweights as Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon, Bale simply outshines everyone else, effectively making this film mostly a single actor's performance. What is worse though is that the rest of the cast don't even seem to care to make their presence on screen memorable or at least noticeable.<br/><br/>Despite being set in the time of Reagan's presidency, American Psycho is obviously a child of late 90's and early noughties. I'm trying hard to remember when the movies started showing this mental shift from glorifying success and making it an apex of human desires and dreams to despising this glorification and rejecting the vanity it brings and symbolizes. Maybe it was Fight Club that pioneered this niche, in which case its cult status gets another reason to exist. But while Fight Club uses mental illness as a main ingredient for an action thriller where the protagonist does break the system he hates so much, here in American Psycho we are ultimately left clueless whether these breakouts of insanity really took place. What if they didn't - and all this was just a sick cry for help from a soul forever trapped in the cage society put it in? Or maybe they did - and the society simply didn't care, busy with its everyday routine. Wouldn't it be even worse?"
"kclipper","8","1","2","3 May 2015"," A statement on narcissism and high society with Bale in top form
","Christian Bale is top notch in this dark comedy that compares serial killer-like sociopathic traits to the drives and ambitions of the opportunists of the New York stock exchange. The setting is the trendy night clubs and big city environment of the 1980's, and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an executive investment banker who just so happens to have a psychopathic personality that lacks emotion and lusts after torture, murder, greed and social status. His mask of sanity is so well portrayed that eventually when his alter ego gets the best of him, his colleagues and associates do not believe that he is able to commit the crimes he is confessing to.<br/><br/>This is a well thought out production by Director, Mary Harron who's screenplay is based on a Bret Easton Ellis novel. Bale plays the ego-maniacal Patrick to sheer perfection. His character, although extremely narcissistic and murderous in nature, displays a guilty conscious that inevitably results in a complete breakdown. The content of the film is dementedly hilarious, as Bateman amorally murders the homeless, mutilates prostitutes, and kills his fellow colleagues over things as simple as business cards and professional status. Bale is excellent at playing a fictional but very complex character, and the film captures the predatory aspects of the big city executive hierarchy. Director, Harron seems to present a statement on the hjman ego and how destructive and desensitized it can be. Comedic touches include Bale chasing a prostitute with a chainsaw through the stairwell of an apartment building completely naked and screaming, and staring himself in a mirror while having sex with prostitutes revealing his complete obsession with his own self image. Its a psychological thriller combined with a twisted sense of humor and appreciation of the musical culture of the 1980's. It features music by Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis, and Robert Palmer, and it all centers on Bateman's ability to irrationally justify his destructive tendencies and descend into a world of madness and depravity. Willem Defoe is a detective hot on his trail and Reese Witherspoon is his self-absorbed, unknowing girlfriend. Audiences will laugh and bewilder over this structurally complicated, satirical character study. Its a story about climbing the ladder of success while disintegrating morally and leaving behind a spiritless, empty shell, but it never ceases to be entertaining."

","Well, I had to include spoilers on this because I have an issue with this film that I must tell to this community. The issue is William Dafoe. Not that his acting is bad, it is just he practically did nothing in the movie. I think it would be better If he caught Patrick Bateman, or got killed by him or any other surprise/twist. What I mean is: What's the point of having William Dafoe in a movie if you are not gonna use him correctly. It is too much talent wasted in this character. Excluding that part, the rest of the film is almost perfect, great and memorable acting from Christian Bale. if it wasn't for this film, he would never been my favorite actor. To be honest I liked much more is acting in this movie than in ""The Dark knight"", I think this one, he's the one he identifies better. A Psycho! I always liked movies about psychopaths and this one did not disappointed me, if there wasn't the masterpiece by Sir Alfred Hitchcock named Psycho, then this would have been my favorite serial killer movie, better than Silence Of The Lambs in my opinion. In overall it is a good movie, you definitely need to watch this! I hope you enjoy the movie!"
"Rhys_Belding","8","1","2","1 February 2014"," Deserves a much higher rating.
","American Psycho (2000) - a beautiful movie about a nice rich man called Patrick Bateman who is a banking executive in New York. He has a lot of money so he decides to spend it nicely. He gives money to the homeless, pays for peoples trips to London and even pays for the meals for his colleagues at high-classed restaurants. He also loves to tape everything he does (like a diary). Haha, just kidding (well maybe not about the taping part). American Psycho is a great movie about Patrick Bateman, a psychopathic killer who kills regularly for pleasure but also because feels he he needs to. This movie is very powerful and the acting is brilliant. The introduction instantly got me hooked due its the beautifully artistic shots and the film continued to be very good throughout and even made me laugh in places. The acting was also fantastic from the majority of the cast. This is a great movie and is definitely worth a watch. Just don't show him your personalized business card. <br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10"
"LincyTy","4","1","2","13 December 2013"," Cliché
","My hopes for this movie were really high, because of the high score it got on IMDb and the many lists this movie appeared on.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, I was really glad. Christian Bales character was a wealthy businessmen who's psychopathic side was hidden for his environment. But then the killing began and I was really disappointed!! Again psychopaths are shown as cold blooded murderers! But not all psychopaths are murderers! When I started to watch this movie I was hoping I was going to see a businessman psychopath. A person who manipulates everybody around him without having any empathy towards them. But not a person who kills almost everybody he meets.<br/><br/>A movie about an other kind of psychopath I would enjoy much more, I have it really hard with the cliché popular media idea of what psychopaths are. Showing a different kind of psychopath to the people would be a plus for the society.<br/><br/>Conclusion: a really cliché movie about a psychopath"

","So many movies that start with the word ""American"": ""American Beauty""; ""American History X""; ""American Pie"". All of them with their own message and version of America, and now this underrated classic not only shows a new vision of America but also of his craziest psychopath.... interesting no? ""American Psycho"" tells the beautiful, crazy, insane, fun, violent life of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). An eccentric American businessman working as an executive of a major bank in Wall Street. Patrick in work he seems the normal rich American worker, but Patrick has an extraordinary secret life ranging from a daily routine with certain quirks to keep things arranged in a certain order; food fads; crazes appearance at work; kill someone in cold blood every night since prostitutes coworkers that he just felt jealousy; and .... oh, wait a minute! As you see, the life of Patrick is one of a psychopathic killer who tries to hide appearances at work, but the film goes far beyond the expected. Director- writer Mary Harron to adapt the novel of Bret Easton Ellis at the same time she tries to be faithful, it goes much further exploring the mind of Patrick 's character more and more.<br/><br/>The film with a story that it could had follow with a somber and a creepy tone of horror movie, but no. In the first few scenes of the film, Mary Harron presents us with a beautiful humor, that ranges from clever phrases to a humorous narrative, and 70% of comes from the mouth of Patrick makes us laugh, that make us feeling at certain times that we are facing a black comedy. Some may consider the humor stupid or unnecessary, but it serves mainly to make us relate to the character Patrick throughout the film, even in the darkest hours.<br/><br/>And yes, the film doesn't escape to have dark and even scary moments, but those moments come through a superb narrative followed with great dialogs with many varied subjects ranging from women-philosophy to the characteristics of the perfect business cards. We even have a moment of dialog between Patrick with two lovers about the songs of Whitney Houston that end's up in the most violent and grim scene of the movie, making us feeling that we are now facing a violent and disturbing film. Such dialogs may be unnecessary for some or boring, but they are so well written and interesting, and serve once again to get into the mad mind of Patrick that at various points where we got to see the kind of person he is and the cause of his great hatred for human being and even the cause of his daily foibles, everything related.<br/><br/>In the levels of performance, the entire cast does a good job, but as always Bale delivers an extravagant performance with its unforgettable character and superb acting deserved of at least a nomination.<br/><br/>A film that goes from humorous to dark and sometimes mysterious, complete with a great script and good direction with an extravagant performance of Bale, makes us enter in the mind of a psychopath in this unforgettable and must-see classic.<br/><br/>9/10"

"williamcouper","10","1","2","9 April 2013"," Best movie I have ever seen in my life.
","I can understand why people wont like this movie, people who watch movie just for a quick distraction that can't really feel inside the movie or being part of the experience. <br/><br/>I first watched this movie after I had a few Whiskey cola back in Boarding school in the late afternoon of April 2010, I couldn't believe that this movie came out ten years ago and I had never heard of it. <br/><br/>First of all I thought that Christian Bale was amazing in the role, I loved that you could feel that he really had too much he has the perfect body, he has the perfect apartment, he has the perfect cloths, the best job, the best girls; therefore something is missing in his life he is insane he said but this insanity is just a will to kill to fill what's missing in his life because he already has everything.<br/><br/>The writer of the novel said that American Psycho is a funny book it's a comedy, it is that extreme that it is funny, but the book is way way way more violent than the movie. A big confusion that happens is during one of the final scenes when Patrick Bateman goes a bit too far and start killing everybody in the street, cops ecc.... and people were saying that this shows that everything that happens before is fake and he is not capable of killing anyone, but Easton Ellis himself said that the only problem with this movie is that people wont believe that he killed anyone after seeing that scene, and a lot of people really got confused. So to clarify to all: He kills everybody you see, there is no dream or thoughts, everything you see happens in his life for real.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie beside the obvious, is the music from the 80s and you really feel there again or nor (i wasn't born yet) and I just love the final monologue.<br/><br/>I wish I was him somehow... without the killings ha ha, that would get me in trouble."
"ketgup83","8","1","2","4 September 2012"," I have become a fan of Christian Bale after this movie.
","American Psycho turned out to be a surprise gruesome, psychotic, weird thriller which made an interesting watch thanks to stupendous performance by Christian Bale and powerful storyline.<br/><br/>A wealthy banking executive is haunted by an alter-ego which he hides from his co-workers and friends but gets trapped further down into his own imaginations and horrifying fantasies.<br/><br/>Directed by Mary Horon , American Psycho is based on a novel of same name by Bret Easton Ellis. Though the movie released some 10 years back but I got the opportunity to watch it now thanks to growing popularity of Christian Bale. I kept on hearing about the movie turning him into a popular star even before The Machinist and Batman Begin and I was not surprised a bit. The actor gets into the character of Patrick Bateman so effortlessly that it is difficult to identify any other actor playing that part. He is horrifying as a serial killer , he is masculine and handsome as a playboy flirting with women , he is innocent when he confesses to himself doing wrong stuff. It is the character that you feel weird , funny, angry and yet sympathizing for his mental illness. The climax is something similar to Inception where the director questions the audience that what is the conclusion. Direction is crunchy adding taste to the film every time new scene turns up. The movie has some disturbing scenes like where Bateman stabs the beggar and kills his dog by stamping on it , the scene where he narrates the feelings coming out of Phil Collin's song while two prostitutes are lying over each other and making out etc. This is certainly not for the weak-hearted audience. Screenplay is engaging , art direction is good along with superb dialogues. Christian Bale is the show-stopper. I have become a fan of this great actor after the movie. He emotes so accurately through his expressions and is complete natural.<br/><br/>So overall , superb intellectual movie in all respect. Must Watch. Excellent 4.4/5"
"RodneyKashmir","10","1","2","3 September 2012"," Christian Bale's best performance
","I'm not going to get into the differences between the book and the movie. This is simply a good movie, disregard the book for minute, the acting was great, the direction was astounding, and the script was chilling. Christian Bale's performance ranges from calm and controlled to a sometimes cartoonish (yet frightening)homicidal mania.<br/><br/>There wee parts of the movie where he almost reminded me of Jim Carrey, yet some how throughout all of it he still scares the crap out of me. This may be a spoiler but I don't' think it is, just be warned; there's a part in the movie where Christian Bale is naked, covered in blood, holding a chainsaw, laughing, chasing a woman down a hall. With any other actor this would've been the stupidest movie scene in history, yet Christian Bale brings a sort of homicidal energy, and deranged joy into it, almost like the Joker from Batman, there is not a second in this movie where I was thinking: ""This is ridiculous"" and there are plenty of scenes like the chainsaw scene mentioned above.<br/><br/>I think this shows the pure ability of Christian Bale that he can take this absurd character and somehow ground him in reality.<br/><br/>I watched this movie twice in a row. I'm not exaggerating. As soon as I finished it I started the whole thing over again and it was just as good if not better the second time. This is one of my favorite movie's and I have no trouble recommending it too a friend or stranger.<br/><br/>Ten out of ten, five out of five, simply an amazing movie."
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","26 August 2012"," ""I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""
","I've been letting my thoughts for this film percolate now for about twenty four hours, so before any more time goes by I'll try to get it all down here. I thought there was something up with the picture when Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his cronies were comparing business cards for the first time. I got the impression that it was all a sham, that none of them were actually Vice Presidents of Pierce and Pierce, and that they were actually role playing the position of executives in anticipation of an eventual promotion. Bateman himself never seemed to do any work, other than having his secretary line up his appointments to meet associates or clients so he could spend additional time not working some more.<br/><br/>The bigger tip off that this was possibly all just an imaginary story was the 'Feed me a stray cat' scene. By this time it was pretty well established that Bateman was unhinged, but the question is, to what degree. Did he really engage in those prior killing sprees or did he just imagine it? Or a third possibility, was he envisioning what it would be like to go completely berserk if all bets were off and he could completely get away with it. By the time the story's over, I think you'd have to be open to all these various interpretations, because in the 'real' world, you wouldn't have a realtor showing an apartment where bodies hung in the closet just days before.<br/><br/>Going in, I had some trepidation when the DVD opened to a menu screen suggesting a splatter flick, and if I'm not mistaken, an image of a chain saw somewhere along the way. I've seen a couple of slasher/gore films in my time, and though I'm not that squeamish (any more), that kind of stuff does nothing for me. So anticipating a chain saw scene, I could only groan at the impossibility of the physics involved in poor Jean (Chloe Sevigny) taking a direct bull's eye hit like that at the bottom of the staircase. Just one more suggestion that this wasn't really happening.<br/><br/>And what of Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe)? What happened to him? Was this Bateman's guilt becoming manifest, either because of an actual murder or because of his own malicious thoughts? Generally I get really upset about movies like this because they tamper with one's ability to follow a coherent story and come to a reliable conclusion about what happened in it. But then again, it's got the word 'Psycho' in the title, so I guess all bets are off. Personally, twenty five dollars for a couple of drinks at a trendy New York City night club is about as psycho as I'll ever get."

","American Psycho– CATCH IT (A-) American Psycho is a cult phenomena and I have been hearing about this movie since its release but somehow never been able to watch it until now. The American Psycho revolves around a wealthy New York investment banking executive hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he escalates deeper into his illogical, gratuitous fantasies. American Psycho goes deep into the mind of human psychology and deals with the pressure of society to be perfect. The direction and writing of the movie is spectacular and it's brilliant to see that it's directed by a woman. That's why the all sexual and killing parts are more ecstatic than gross. Don't take me wrong defiantly killing someone with chainsaw is gross but it's not shot chainsaw massacre sort of gross. The movie is great till the final act where it leaves you tangling between what's real and what's not. Christian Bale is super as American Psycho caught between living perfect life and his darkest desires. There is sense of believe in everything he does and this whole attire, his physique was close to perfection. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas and Jared Leto were good their parts but on the whole it was a one man show. American Psycho is a cult classic and if you like movies with open ending. Watch it!"
"evanbuckley66","7","1","2","19 May 2012"," A review, I done for the site Don't Touch The Watch!
","Published in 1991 by Vintage Books, the novel 'American Psycho' is told in the first person perspective of supposed serial killer, and Wall Street yuppie 'Patrick Bateman'. The book depicts in savage detail numerous and grotesque acts of violence towards women, mixed with a pornographic level of sexual content, that led to a great deal of controversy and outrage on its release.<br/><br/>Set among the wealthy elite of Manhattan at the tail end of the 1980's, 'American Psycho' spans about three years in the life of privileged investment banker 'Patrick Bateman'. The book documents his everyday activities, told from his detached, self-obsessed perspective. <br/><br/>There are frequent accounts of sex acts with prostitutes that 'Bateman solicits'; these (""hardbodies"") as he puts it are subjected to the worst descriptions of torture, rape, mutilation, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Originally optioned in 1991 just after its release, hoping to cash in on the wave of controversy generated by the book, the idea of an 'American Psycho' movie was shopped around the major studios. A number of scripts were drawn up, some scripted by Ellis himself, but treated the movie as a joke, Ellis even ended his script with 'Bateman' breaking into song, joined by the whole of New York.<br/><br/>Instead the studio settled on Mary Harron, who had achieved a level of success with her 1996 film 'I shot Andy Warhol' (a period piece set in the sixties), Harron was given the task of creating 1980s Wall Street; at the peak of its 'greed is good' mentality. Initially, she considered a number of actors for the role of Bateman, including Billy Crudup, Ben Chaplin, Jonny Lee Miller, and Jared Leto. Eventually, Harron offered the part to Christian Bale, a little known, at the time British actor.<br/><br/>Having accepted the role, Bale was met with contempt from producers, who tried to talk Harron into casting Edward Norton instead. Refusing, Harron stuck to her decision, insisting she would only make the movie if Bale was her lead. The studio finally relented, but as compensation they insisted the supporting cast be rounded out with big name actors. Agreeing, Harron hired William Defoe to play Kimball and Reese Witherspoon to play Evelyn.<br/><br/>With knives pointed squarely at the 'yuppie' juggler, Harron and her writing partner Guinevere Turner, set about to turn Ellis's episodic un- filmable novel into a viable movie. That scathingly dissects the wretched yuppie consumer driven lifestyle, under the movies sharp script. Along with a hypnotically unhinged performance by Bale, the movie turns what could have been a sadistic run of the mill serial killer movie, into something darkly comic and unique.<br/><br/>What little plot exists in the movie is loosely strung together by the murder of Paul Allen and the investigation into his disappearance. 'American Psycho' deliberately feels incoherent and detached as people fail to recognise each other, and often mistake one person for another, as they have becomes so interchangeable. Just as 'Bateman'spends all day in his office but never works, and visits 'ATMS' to with draw cash to an already over filled wallet. These people and their lives may look glamorous and filled with purpose, but scratch the surface and you'l find there's nothing there.<br/><br/>Speaking recently in an interview, Harron spoke of how she saw 'Bateman' as an alien life form, trying to copy our mannerisms, to ""fit in"", as he puts it. He acts as human as he can, but he's so twisted by greed and status that he's stopped being one of us, more of an entity, collected from the cesspool of all that was rotten in the greed is good era.<br/><br/>Bale inhabits 'Bateman', in a way no other actor possibly could. His skin an orange glow, his body a rippling series of muscles, covered by exquisitely designed suits. He so inhabits the character, that when you see him on screen you just see 'Bateman', never a performance. Having watched an appearance by Tom Cruise on the David Letterman show, Bale modeled his character on what he calls ""this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes"" masked by an appropriately phony smile.<br/><br/>During the shooting of the film, Bale never dropped character even speaking in an American accent off set at all times. It was only at the wrap party, that he finally spoke in his own British accent, to the surprise of the crew members who thought he was speaking that way as a joke. It's that level of commitment that makes Bale the perfect casting choice, told at the time it would be career suicide to play the consumer monster; it instead had the opposite effect, leading to another American psycho, 'The Batman'.<br/><br/>Filled with endlessly quotable dialogue and classic scenes, like Bateman's moonwalk in the infamous 'hey Paul' scene. The movie has taken on another life since being released, even surpassing the notorious book that it was based on. E.B From http://donttouchthewatch.blogspot.com/"

","I have to be perfectly honest with you, I only read parts of the 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis. The snatches of text that I read were enough to repulse me to the umpteenth degree.<br/><br/>American Psycho, directed by Mary Harron, and starring notable actor Christian Bale, is nothing less than fascinating and intriguing. This is why I would be amiss if I gave it anything less than an 8.<br/><br/>I want to begin with stating the cons of this film.<br/><br/>I am sadly disappointed by the disappointing cinematography. The actual look of the footage seems poor.<br/><br/>A very big disappointment for me, and I don't want you to think of me as a terribly evil person, but I found there was TOO little killing the film. This film is titled American Psycho, but I think the way Mary Harron and Gueniverre Turner handled the material, it should have been called American Metrosexual/Narcissist.<br/><br/>You might be wondering by now, what did I like about the 2000 film adaptation.<br/><br/>I loved Christian Bale's performance. At first, I believed it was fake. I thought he was doing a terrible acting job.<br/><br/>Then I reviewed the film again. It seemed that he was doing a parody of a fully narcissistic person.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert and I enjoyed how Christian Bale acted in this film with no reservations whatsoever. Instead, he delved deep into psychosis and vanity without any regards (and in the acting world, that's a brilliant thing.) Kudos to Christian Bale.<br/><br/>I think what makes this film enigmatic is that it is a stunning, satirical portrait of narcissism, vanity, conspicuous consumption, and immorality.<br/><br/>What makes the film better is in the end, discovering that Patrick Bateman might not have actually murdered anyone, but rather imagined it all in his sick head."
"themkody","10","1","2","1 July 2011"," Equally a great character-study as it is a comedy
","This movie is, on many levels, very identical to the film ""Falling Down"", but is by no means a bad remake. In fact, both of them are equally great. This film is from back in the day, back when Christian Bale had some great roles (before he devoted himself to a lousy portrayal of Bat(-e)man.) I'd go as far and say that his portrayal of Patrick Bateman is one of the best performances of the decade.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, we see how Bateman minute by minute slowly turns into a cruel, ruthless monster. Already 5 minutes in, we begin to feel disgust towards him, but it is only the beginning. As weird as this sounds, every time he gets more ruthless he gets funnier too. There are even scenes where you feel disgust towards him, but on the same time can't stop laughing at the decisions he makes, combined with his use of words. It's a really thrilling (not to mention rewarding) experience. If you removed either the character-study or the humour, this would still have been a great movie. Both elements works really, really well, but the fusion of those two elements makes the film work exceptionally well.<br/><br/>The way this film combines dark humour, madness, great performances and character study is phenomenal. I can't recommend this movie enough - Moose finds this film worthy of a 10."
"Ashley_Sumpter","8","1","2","28 June 2011"," Perfect portrait of a psychopath
","I just saw this movie for the first, and i must say (with a degree in criminal psychology and knowing a lot of information on this subject), that this is a perfect example of a psychopath! Unfortunately i haven't read the book yet, however, it's incredible how well developed the character is.<br/><br/>The lack of empathy is obvious and pointed out throughout the movie, and the fact that he ALWAYS has his ego as the first priority, for example, when he didn't kill both Jean and Luis because they complemented him, saying that he was fit, or attractive. The only thing that was truly important to him was himself and how he was presented.<br/><br/>The despise that was given to anyone else could also be noted because of the way he keeps talking about music curiosities while he's killing someone. It's very interesting to see how he interprets the songs, mostly when he's talking about whitney houston's greatest love of all.<br/><br/>Cristian Bale's performance is truly amazing, I've already seen his other works, but this one is truly remarkable! he makes the whole movie, and really makes the character believable!<br/><br/>The last scene is really something, and the constant battle between himself is very interesting to watch, as he feels nothing, however he's very afraid to lose his control.<br/><br/>overall i think that's an amazing movie, and people who like to think and try to understand this kind of mental disturbance will really enjoy seeing it."
"mrbusyb","8","1","2","12 May 2011"," As I was afraid to laugh, this movie is a dark comedy
","I give this movie an 8 because it flows along from beginning to end in absurd Hunter S. Thompson like fashion much like the movies ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and ""Crank."" So, it isn't an original. About the segment of society that is cool-as-a-cucumber and sophisticated, ""American Psycho"" is ""The Matrix"" with color added. The antagonist bad guy in this movie is not an an individual but more of an abstract expressing how a lone psychopathic killer can go unnoticed in a sociopathic business world. Christian Bale plays the part of vice president Patrick Bateman. Patrick Bateman plays the part of me, myself and I which Freud commonly referred to as the ""It"" (id) character to the ego and the superego. It loves himself. It only thinks about himself. It wants the best business card. It humps and pumps faceless women while cherishing and filming himself. It wants to be able to call a restaurant and get an immediate reservation. When It doesn't get what he wants, he kills out in the open any time and any where. There is certainly a lot to explore in the depths of this disturbing dark comedy. Perhaps the reason this movie is so puzzling to many is because it accurately portrays society for what it is. While those on top of the world like to think of themselves as above nature, they are in fact the top predators in it."
"fidelio74","8","1","2","27 October 2010"," To film the unfilmable
","We had to wait nine long years but it finally happened; 'American Psycho' was filmed! And what's more, director Mary Harron did a fantastic job. Bret Easton Ellis' novel created a massive controversy upon its release in 1991, the book's graphic sex and violence offending many readers. There were calls for the novel to be banned, which in turn created a very interesting debate about free speech. The book is a modern classic; not as good as Ellis' masterpiece, 'Glamorama', but stunning nonetheless.<br/><br/>Christian Bale stars as the psychotic, fashion- and music-obsessed Wall Street broker Patrick Bateman who has everything: good looks, a great body, a beautiful girlfriend, a high-paying job, and a spectacular Central Park West apartment. But appearances can be deceiving, and just beneath Bateman's saturnine surface simmers a rage and madness which is spiralling out of control.<br/><br/>The film looks fantastic, full of chic fashions and beautiful people. And it sounds great too, with a splendid soundtrack featuring David Bowie ('Something in the Air'), Huey Lewis and the News ('Hip to be Square'), New Order ('True Faith'), and others. 'Something in the Air' plays over the initial end credits; the same song plays over the initial end credits of Christoper Nolan's mind-bending 'Memento'.<br/><br/>The sequel, 'American Psycho 2: All-American Girl' is what you would expect from a direct-to-DVD release: utter dreck. William Shatner puts in an appearance, and his presence is always most welcome.<br/><br/>I do hope 'Glamorama' ('Specks!') is filmed because it would make a great movie. I recently read 'Imperial Bedrooms' which is a sequel to 'Less Than Zero', and quite enjoyed it. Ellis is a massive talent and I look forward to the film adaptation of his 'Lunar Park'.<br/><br/>Much of the sex and violence in the novel 'American Psycho' does not make it into the film. Harron has used a very classy and restrained approach, although the movie does still have its nasty moments. I hope she makes more films because she is clearly a very talented director and someone to watch."

While I'm pretty sure this was also in the book, the really weak follow-up to this, showed us that even with a great source material, you don't have a guarantee that the movie will be great. In this case and with Christian Bale on great form (maybe only his part in the Mechanists overshadows this performance to date, end of 2010), with a very quirky and darkly funny script.<br/><br/>While everyone is talking about the ending, this is exactly what the filmmaker wanted us to do. And I love it, because it adds another layer/level to the whole movie. Which is just great. And in case you haven't read the book either, this is not for the faint hearted. Be advised that this does deliberately offend and provoke. You may not like what you see. Actually it would be a big surprise if you really liked the characters at all. But that's the point. Which could also work as a downfall for the movie. But it is handled with great care by the director."
"MBunge","8","1","2","8 September 2010"," Mesmerizing satire on the 1980s
","American Psycho is a movie that casts the 1980s as a vacuous, amoral, materialistic, nihilistic, degrading and degraded era of American lifebut it tries not to be too judgmental about it. <br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works at a major New York financial firm doing whatever it is well-dressed men do as such places. Bateman is utterly self-absorbed and obsessed with his appearance and is jealous of anyone more socially successful than he is. He's cheating on his fiancée and knows she's cheating on him. He hangs around with three businessman friends who only talk about getting high, getting lucky and getting into the trendiest New York hot spots. Oh, and Patrick Bateman is also an insane serial killer. <br/><br/>Now, given that, you might expect American Psycho to be some sort of thriller where Patrick Bateman is the villain and we watch him systematically slaughter people in ironically appropriate ways until one of his intended victims or some cop finally put an end to him. This movie, however, is about as far from that as you can get. It's not a thriller. The killings are random and without any greater significance. There is no heroic victim, and Patrick Bateman isn't really a villain. <br/><br/>This film is actually a social commentary, punctuated with moments of crazed violence and an ending that wants to leave you with more questions than answers. As social commentary it doesn't have a very dynamic plot and how much you enjoy it depends a great deal on whether you get the point it's trying to make and agree with it. But if you do both of those things, this is an almost hypnotically disturbing film that keeps you on edge until the very last moment. <br/><br/>Christian Bale does a very fine job with an unusually difficult character to play. Patrick Bateman is all surface. There's no internal life or self-awareness to him. He also happens to be very evil. But he's the main character in this story and we see and hear and experience the world mostly through his point of view. It's hard to spend that much time with that intrinsically limited a character and not get sick and tired of them. Bale manages to hold your attention and emotional involvement all the way through, and not just through his inherent charisma. He lets you feel sorry for Bateman as a man who is desperate for satisfaction in his life but cannot achieve it and doesn't even really know what it would be. Bateman has no conscience but Bale makes you feel that he as an actor might have one, giving the audience something to connect with. <br/><br/>The social commentary in American Psycho comes from our observing Bateman in his natural environment and noticing that the rich New York City crowd he runs with isn't that different from him. Indeed, the film forces you to wonder why they all aren't out butchering people left and right and suggests that Bateman is just more honest about what he is while the others never stop to think about it. I n a world of yuppie scum, the serial killer is the only one with any real spiritual integrity. <br/><br/>This is a very well directed film. Haron crafts scenes of berserk violence with an almost dreamlike serenity. She not only makes us understand the social hierarchy and status competition that these financial sharks pour into their business cards, but she also makes us see how completely arbitrary and nonsensical it is at the same time. <br/><br/>American Psycho does have one of those ""twist"" endings. You know, where the stuff you just spend and hour and 40 minutes watching turns out not to be what it appeared. But while many of those kind of endings ruin a film by making everything you see meaningless, American Psycho gets it right. Instead of just rendering everything before it invalid, this twist ending gives it all a different interpretation. What happened may not have happened but it still meant something. <br/><br/>American Psycho is a movie with a sedate, intellectual veneer about a world where veneer is all that really exists. It wants you to think about thatbut it's not interested in telling you what to think. It asks you to substitute your judgment into the story and make of it what you will. So, if you're interested less is something that will entertain you and more in something will make you ponder, try this film."
"cartermichael90","10","1","2","26 May 2010"," Excellent film but also frightening to know these people exist.
","The film title is self explanatory. It's about an American, that is a psycho. Christian Bale's character is depicted brilliantly in this film and to think that people like this exist in real life is a somewhat frightening thought. American Psycho puts forward the idea of of self perfection to the extreme. Physically and just to name one example, in his work when he is trying to withhold his inner rage from not having the best 'business card' out of his colleagues. <br/><br/>There are many films where there is a person who goes from being 'normal' human being to a psycho and vice versa. But here, Bale's character is psychotic from the beginning until the end with no explanation as to why. Towards the end he tries to let his lawyer know he's killed people, but no one will listen to him and this is the closest he gets to having any form of logical knowledge. <br/><br/>This film is excellent and is very unique as it isn't always the protagonist narrating his own film however in this interpretation he does and it makes it all the most interesting and intriguing. <br/><br/>A must buy. If not, then at least worth watching."
"freemantle_uk","8","1","2","24 January 2010"," A violence, surreal film
","American Psycho was based on a successful novel, which led to being a film with a cult following. It is the most successful film of Mary Harron's career, and Christian Bale's first lead role as an adult actor.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christain Bale), is a very rich, successful 27-year-old man working for a major Wall Street investment company. He lives in a nice apartment in the Big Apple, physically very fit, hansom, has a organized routine, and is completely insane. He lives the high live of an executive, fancy restaurants, beautiful women, recreational drugs, etc... There is an even darker side to his world, involving affairs, prostitution and of course very violence murder. His blood lust starts to increase and can't content himself. He murders tramps and prostitutes, he suffers from extreme anger and envy. He murders Paul Allen (Jared Leto), another successful young man: his disappearance is investigated Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe). Patrick's mind starts to decline.<br/><br/>This film is more surreal then I expected. It reminded very much of A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, both classics, but looking at the upper end of society, not the working class. It does show a man who mind does break down and his looking for an identity in a hollow world. It is a satire of the high-powered 80s New York. It has a strange dark humour in places that works.<br/><br/>Of course this film has a great cast. This is the film that made Bale's adult career. He has a great performance as a psychopath and shows his talent. I particularly enjoyed the scene when he murders Paul Allen where he was like Jim Carrey. Jared Leto only has a small role but is good as he normally is. So was Cara Seymour as a prostitute who is brought into Patrick's corrupted world.<br/><br/>Harron directs a very violence, but this isn't torture porn like Hostel or the Saw films. There is reason behind it, and she only shows what she has to. She shows that she has a competent hand behind the camera and a decent art-house director. She handles the mix between reality and fantasy, leaving the film to be very ambiguous.<br/><br/>A decent watch."
"TheEtherWalk","10","1","2","7 January 2010"," This is American Psycho. Great great movie, a personal favorite.
","American Psycho is the story of a 20-something 1980s Wall Street exec named Patrick Bateman. He has all the money he could ever want, a beautiful fiancée, a huge apartment, and more. His lifestyle consists of getting reservations at the best restaurants, doing cocaine, working out, cheating on his fiancée with her best friend as well as several prostitutes, renting porno tapes and killing people. (He also never seems to do an ounce of work at whatever it is he does.) He doesn't understand why he does the things he does, but below the surface are clues that make it a brilliant character study, as well as a darkly hilarious satire of yuppie culture. It is also technically brilliant, with great cinematography, set designs and musical score. Watch the chainsaw scene for a good example of all of these.<br/><br/>Christian Bale IS Patrick Bateman. I can imagine no other actor in this role. Bateman is narcissistic perfectionist, obsessed with fashion, status and outdoing his co-workers down to the most minute details. There is a scene where he asks two women if they have ever heard of his company, and when they say no, a subtle little scowl forms on his face. This says volumes about his character, how he thinks himself as almost a god and anyone who makes him feel even remotely inadequate needs to be destroyed. Another great scene is where Patrick views a colleague's business card, which is better than his, and he appears to be sweating from every pore. If he can't be the best at everything, he starts to lose it. <br/><br/>He is also unable to connect with people on an emotional level, and probably likes it that way. Willem Dafoe shows up as a detective investigating one of his murders, and when he pulls out a CD from Huey Lewis and the News, (one of Bateman's favorites, but more on that later) Bateman denies being a fan of them. He doesn't like making any kind of connection with other people. In fact, Bateman has lived this way for so long that he has forgotten how to feel. (It's also strongly hinted that he might be a latent homosexual who is in complete denial to himself, at least in my opinion.) When his mistress says 'Can we talk?' he replies 'You look beautiful. There's nothing else to say.' He looks on the rest of humanity with contempt, and kills simply because he can. He has nothing in common with them, so he wants to inflict his inner pain on them. This pain is created by his empty life that is void of any meaning. He's like a king looking down on a rabble of peasants. This story could be about anyone in a position of untouchable power. The depth of his character is remarkable, and there's loads of subtext in almost every scene that make you notice something different every time you see this film. And it is very re-watchable. <br/><br/>The one person that sheds a light on what little humanity he has left is his secretary Jean, played by the beautiful Chloe Sevigny. He very nearly makes an emotional connection with her, and actually holds back on killing her. I think it's her innocence that saves her, because it makes her the one person who represents hope for Patrick.<br/><br/>Few films are able to be both shocking and funny simultaneously, but there are several moments here of ingenious black comedy. The most memorable scene involves Jared Leto's character Paul Allen. Bateman gets him drunk and takes him back to his apartment, and in the living room there are newspapers all over the floor. Bateman starts talking about Huey Lewis and the News, all while putting on a raincoat and grabbing an axe behind Paul's back. While dancing to the song Hip To Be Square, he lunges at Paul with the axe, killing him and spraying blood all over himself and the previously placed newspapers. Absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>This movie is endlessly quotable, from top to bottom. The dry way the characters talk is both hilarious and pathetic. These are not sympathetic characters, but it is enjoyable to watch how they attempt to act like human beings. Who could forget lines like ""It's totally disease-free"" or ""I'm in touch with humanity"". The brutal murders are almost an afterthought to the brilliantly crafted world of Patrick's psyche.<br/><br/>If there is a complaint to be made about this movie, it's that it could easily be 10 minutes longer. Some brilliant sections of the book have been omitted, including some surreal and hallucinatory scenes and some hilarious lines that would have brought this to the level of a masterpiece. Maybe Harron plays it a little too safe and should have let the story run wild and unhinged. Having said this, every scene taken from the book is adapted faithfully and the things that have been added make the story better.<br/><br/>In 2000, who could have seen a movie like this coming? This could easily have been overlooked entirely, but as it stands today American Psycho is a cult classic. It is endlessly rewatchable, from the multiple psychological layers, to the hilarious dialogue, to the performance of a lifetime by Bale. There has never been a movie like this and there probably never will be.<br/><br/>This review has meant nothing... this movie is not an exit."
"gainestillinger","9","1","2","1 November 2009"," Barry Norman knows nothing.
","Barry Norman once said that playing Patrick Bateman, a rich twenty-seven year old Wall Street nutjob, could very well have been 'suicide' for Christian Bale. Ha! What did he know? American Psycho is a dissection of the modern executive man syndrome, but set in the eighties with Gordan Gecko haircuts, Charlie Sheen all-night benders, sharp suits, bags of drugs and enough sexism to give Germaine Greer a stroke. It is Wall Street but without the building tension of a plot. Instead, all we are left with is a character piece that expresses itself through Bateman's narrations on how he is not really here, that he feels nothing but 'disgust' and 'greed' and how he knows not why his nightime murder sprees are becoming more violent and horrific.<br/><br/>Throughout this film we are, as is Bateman, clueless as to why he feels the need to slay beautiful women and fellow yuppies; why he sweats through his Valentino couture suits when a colleague produces a more tasteful business card than his own (Batemen later butchers the said colleague with an axe to the face); and why he feels the need to put a nail gun to the head of his unsuspecting secretary whilst having a quiet drink at his quite expensive apartment. As it progresses we get the sense that this film is not going to peak in a 'Seven' type ending, but that instead it is a wandering exploration of how enough money leads to illusions of grandeur and the belief that you can do just about anything you want; that it is a conceptual piece and the nada-plot and subsequent uber-violence are products of that concept. We are left with an idea and the realisation that Bateman probably isn't there at all, that he is just one of a million like him that can't see past the end of their thousand dollar Mont Blanc fountain pen and ten grand oyster movement Rolex submariner.<br/><br/>This film launched Bale's career in a way that many other films could not. It was daring, controversial and ultimately a gamble. It's a shame that other actors do not take this kind of risk... and that Bale went on to make Terminator Salvation. That's another review though. Still, if Barry Norman thought that this film could have gone one way or the other: how did it go the one way? Well, aside from the stuff already mentioned, the film is a broad mixture of amazing set pieces, costumes that make tailors salivate and very black humour. Bateman ends up with an almost catch phrase line 'I've got to return some videotapes' which he repeats several times in the film instead of, say, strangling his homosexual colleague in the toilets of an expensive boys' club, or as a parting line in a brutal public break up with his fiancé.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me about this film is that despite the story's focus on violence toward women, it was in fact directed by a woman, Mary Harron. Perhaps this is where the film works. If it had been directed by a man the focus may have been solely anti-woman, rather than the humour, the style of the time and the concept of this finished product."
"ozymandiaskingofkings","8","1","2","1 July 2009"," Bale IS Bateman
","I recently got this on DVD and felt that it was worth reviewing as, although I had seen the film before, it was a long time ago and I feel that I basically missed the point of the whole thing, concentrating on the serial killer aspect and not fully appreciating the more sophisticated vein of black comedy beneath it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film is gloriously bloody and violent, with several scenes of brutal and shocking murder, but in actuality this is a far more complex film, mixing elements of social satire, pitch black comedy and existential drama.<br/><br/>Set in the latter years of the 80s, the film follows Patrick Bateman, a handsome, successful and intelligent 20 something, who is nevertheless a thoroughly unpleasant individual. Bateman is a yuppie who has pretty much everything that most people (not me, but as far as I'm aware the average person) aspire for: lots of money, a nice apartment and a beautiful, if a little dim, fiancé (played by the delightful Reese Witherspoon as charmingly stupid), yet he is ultimately a totally shallow, empty individual, with no real taste or passion, living an utterly unfulfilling life which he is only able to fill by committing horrendous murders. His only passions are incredibly inane, and though he offers opinions on politics, morality etc, he ultimately cares only about having the most stylish business card or eating at the best restaurant.<br/><br/>What is fascinating about the film is that while Bateman is initially utterly unlikeable, coming across from the outset as narcissistic, shallow and hypocritical, he is no simple Gordon Gecko style monster and, strange as it seems, as Bateman goes off the rails and slides into homicidal insanity, he becomes more likable and more human, until we are almost on his side. Of course, crucial to the success of the film is that Bateman is a comic creation as well as a horrific one, often trying to confess his murders to those who don't listen (""I like to dissect girls, Do you know I'm utterly insane?"" he offers to one disinterested character) and giving lengthy monologues on 80s music shortly before committing his crimes.<br/><br/>Of course, much of the praise for making Bateman such a fascinating figure should rest at the feet of Christian Bale, and despite a fantastic supporting cast, it is ultimately his film. Interestingly, his Bateman, a slick popular businessman who is all carefully constructed image, but in reality is violent and disturbed, seems to eerily predict his reading of Bruce Wayne in Chris Nolan's Batman films, though of course, Bateman channels his angst and wrath in much less healthy ways Visually, the film is extremely impressive, a world of clinical, immaculate apartments, affluent nightclubs and soulless offices presented in stunning blandness, while the murders are colourful and shockingly choreographed, often the only scenes of intrigue or vibrancy. The problem with this is that it leaves the film open to accusations of 'style over substance', and initially the film appears to mirror its protagonist; great to look at, and extremely cool, but ultimately soulless. However, this is all flipped in a final act which has us questioning all we have seen so far.<br/><br/>Comparisons have been made with ""Fight Club"", but these are wide of the mark as it is neither as subversive, nor as effective as Fincher's movie. Bateman doesn't really change or learn anything as the film goes on and he film doesn't have the rich subtext of ""Fight Club"", often falling back on just laughing at the idiocy of yuppies. However, the emphasis on murder as something to bring emotion and meaning to life is fascinating, and in some ways echoes Camus' ""The Outsider"", and while not entirely successful or clear in its message, it is still a funny, shocking and intelligent film, anchored by an amazing central performance from Christian Bale."

","When I saw this movie, I saw my boss in the protagonist. The line about ""I am not even there"", the deadpan, the utter ruthlessness. And a successful financial professional. Some commenters think he's just a symbol. I know he actually exists, just as depicted.<br/><br/>They don't all commit murder. Or maybe they all do. I wouldn't know. The best ones cover it up successfully. Those who know, don't find it in their interest to tell.<br/><br/>The ending is not ambiguous. It is clear from the paint and redecoration in the apartment, exactly where the corpses and body parts were, that it's being covered up. It's probably someone buying the place for cheap because of all the gruesomeness there, fixing it up with paint and carpet, then selling it for more money while forgetting to mention its past.<br/><br/>Therefore of course the people redecorating the apartment want our hero out. He's looking around carefully at the sensitive areas, maybe he knew something about the murders. It doesn't help them for him to be there.<br/><br/>The lawyer doesn't want to know all that stuff either. It doesn't help him to know it. He's the same sort of guy after all.<br/><br/>Nobody cares about the people who were killed. Nobody worries about whether this guy is a killer, because it doesn't help them, and maybe they too are killers. Life and the fight continue.<br/><br/>That's how it is in that world. It's the world I find myself in, and it is brilliantly, profoundly true to life."
"codchops","10","1","2","14 June 2009"," Don't just stare at it, eat it!!!
","So often films fail to live up to the books that preceded them, American Psycho however is a masterpiece in its own right. I absolutely loved the book but I feel that the book and the movie have a totally different feel to them and both are exceptional works of art.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite movies of all time and definitely in my top 5. Bale gives a faultless performance and gets so involved in his character that, given the character, it is quite worrying! The way he plays the suave perfectionist and goes off on rants about Phil Collins and Whitney Houston is masterful.<br/><br/>The movie is shot superbly and the 80's theme is well executed from the hang out locations and clothing worn by the characters, right down to the hairstyles. The sound track is excellent too.<br/><br/>I personally see this movie as a black comedy and I laugh out loud at many parts on every viewing.<br/><br/>What is also great about this movie is that you can have your own take on the meaning. Does Patrick actually commit all of the deaths but the Wall Street yuppies are so stereotyped that no one even notices that people are missing? Or is the killing spree all in his imagination?<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie which keeps you full of thought long after the credits roll. Some may look at the title and immediately write it off as a slasher movie. Don't be fooled. There are some scenes which may not be to all tastes but this movie can be classed as a black comedy or 80's Wall Street biopic horror!<br/><br/>Do you like Huey Lewis & the News?<br/><br/>A masterpiece. 10/10."

","I for one am not really a big Christian Bale fan even though his performances are pretty good especially his ""Batman"" efforts. I must say though that this satire was pretty direct and his performance strong. With today's media culture obsessed with murder and serial killers this film ""American Psycho"" can give film fans a nice taste for their thirst. Set in 1980's New York City you have Bale as wall street and power hungry yuppie Patrick Bateman who's at the top of his game he has a nice apartment, nice clothes, and plenty of lady friends. And also he's a pop culture quoting champ of the current times and 80's music. Yet behind it all deep down he's a psychopath who murders, it doesn't matter if it's strangers or people he knows. This really showed a side of a Ted Bundy type a good outward appearance, but a demon on the inside. Plus this film really captured the 80's scene well by the way it showed the hairstyles, clubs, drugs, and it was well evidenced as it played some of the better hit songs from the 1980's. Overall good film with a good Bale performance it may not be everyone's cup of tea yet it explores the greatest decade well while showcasing the dark side of life proving even the best supposed outward appearance can be terrifying and chilling underneath and on the inside."
"Was-it-All-a-Dream","7","1","2","3 May 2009"," American Psycho (2000)
","I don't know if you've noticed, but serial killer movies in the horror genre have grown stale. Since 1986's very good Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, they've been cheap and too easy to produce. So, literally, just about everyone looking to make a name for themselves has made some kind of serial killer movie. The success of 2002's direct-to-video masterpiece Dahmer even started a series (Gacy, Bundy, Ed Gein). Also, multiple films based on the Zodiac killer, dozens of home invasion themed films, hundreds of ""based on a true story"" clones, and even parodies such as 2006's Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon. It's out of control. Reality in horror has never been more popular. Yet, the reality of these serial killer films is no more real than the masters of the sub-genre. Henry, for one. Also- 1991's The Silence of the Lambs, 1995's Se7en, 1973's Deranged, Wes Craven's immortal The Last House on the Left, and perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho. This genre screams, ""Been there. Done that."" A new film about a serial killer needs a fresh approach.<br/><br/>Enter: American Psycho. This 2000 adaptation of the controversial Brett Easton Ellis novel took almost a decade to be made, but I think the film dares to go where almost no other killer film will- blaming its' killer on the culture of America itself. Being a rich, handsome, well-dressed bachelor in the New York business and club scenes of the mid-to-late 80's gives him a wealth of opportunities to meet women he would spend only a night with. Prostitutes, models, drug users, friends of friends. Patrick Bateman is one of the most sickening serial killer characters ever put on screen. He is a member of the sort of Wall Street Elite- a soulless, robotically judgmental bunch who go anywhere they want, do whatever they want, say whatever they want to - with no consequences. But even with this group, there is a chain of superiority. Built by acquiring certain status symbols. And with Patrick being toward the bottom of said chain, he's grown so needy of the status and yet, always receiving less of the validation that his fellow suits are pulling in. With that urge for utmost entitlement not satisfied, Patrick is becoming a blank rage.<br/><br/>Now, that sounds rather cold and boring. It is, but it's also meant to be. The film captures the empty artificiality of Bateman and his type, which are hollow shells. Like an assembly line of pods which factory workers fill with raw material that are shaped by machines into products. Products that all look the same and are hard to tell apart. And that's the key to the film. Psycho is a world where the vultures (the ""werewolves of Wall Street,"" if you will) and their prey are equally hard to differentiate between. Patrick's victims are as faceless or nameless as he is (Patrick is all throughout the film mistaken for different people). And that's where the story gets interesting. Because, now the concept of things like alibis are irrelevant. Patrick lives in a who's-who society of people who are all on drugs or can't be bothered to pay attention to where they've been because their focus is on where they have to be next. It's almost a dark fantasy world, one where again, there are no consequences because there is zero sense of accountability. And in this world, that won't change. The system is too fed by the powers in charge of the nation. If one changes, the other has to change too. In a movie like this, ""change"" is nothing more than a lyric in a Michael Jackson song.<br/><br/>The film remains purely fascinating. It's always updating itself with new information, and Patrick does undergo a crude character arc of sorts. I especially find it intriguing how his class of victims begins to change as the film progresses. Moving from prostitutes and homeless beggars to his rich friends and business associates. Even though he kills the man he sees who in his mind has it all, Paul Allen (played by 90's TV heartthrob, Jared Leto), no one notices that he's even missing. Patrick also assumes the identity of one of his other clones, no one notices. No one cares to notice. A fascinating turn of the knife from a similar set-up, for instance in 1999's The Talented Mr. Ripley- where, people actually do notice when the guy who has-it-all goes missing. The horror of American Psycho is the manner in which the film feeds Bateman his victims. Some of them have a human side, which is all we're given to relate to in the film. Otherwise, we're just sitting back and watching the horrors taking place on screen served up cold with no morality and no end in sight to the story.<br/><br/>Lastly, the relevance of American Psycho today is how shockingly the film predicted a piece of history that was about to take place. How much the character portrayals of Bateman and his gang of clones have in common with former U.S. ""President"" George W. Bush and his administration of evil minions. Other than the obvious heartless and soulless quality to these people, was how much Bush was like a fictional character. And like Bateman himself. His father was a huge power icon (Bateman's father in Psycho owns the company everyone works at), he was a drone selected to do an important job and took advantage of the position for his own personal gains, he's handsome and was dressed well, says everything his cronies wanted to hear even when he was just spitting and not saying anything, and untold numbers of people died because of him. He was so pathetic in fact, he could've been Bateman's brother. That truly makes American Psycho a horror film unlike any other. One that retroactively has its' finger on the pulse of real life terror and tragedy. Oliver Stone's character study, W., was too little, too late."

","1st watched 3/9/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Mary Harron): Dark comedy that is worthwhile but loses it's thunder in the last ½ hour due to the filmmakers turning us in strange directions. The film is basically about a 80's yuppie who has a secret obsession to kill while spouting off reviews of popular 80's music. Christian Bale is wonderful in the twisted role of a VP for a wall street firm who knows how to say all the right things and has the right acquaintances but can't stand it when one of his comrades has a better business card than his. This jeolousy and overly-perfect perspective leads him to kill those who he thinks deserves nothing and anyone who might get in the way of his own ego. He loses his ability to be cool around all this after a detective starts asking him questions about the disappearance of a colleague that he killed. At this point in the movie the dark comedy tries to take a direction towards whether or not Bale's character will make a mistake and be caught. This is where, in my opinion, the movie goes downhill. His ""don't care about anyone"" mentality is challenged but is never really taken anywhere. The way the movie ends also doesn't make sense and we're left with a good movie that could have been much better. The movie is unique in it's dry attempt to make fun of this yuppie generation and Bale's portrayal lifts the movie above mediocrity but the lack of a good conclusion lessons the films impact. Still, it's a movie to watch and enjoy for the most part."

","My friend Dmitry thinks that Mary Harron is prejudiced against the male characters. Also Dmitry hates ""it was all a dream"" stories, of which he considers ""American Psycho"" one. He thinks the movie fails as tragedy and comedy, because there are no consequences for Patrick Bateman.<br/><br/>Here's part of his letter to me regarding this film:<br/><br/>""what's the point of the story? is it about a shark among sharks who has a touch of humanity which makes him hate himself and disagree with the world he lives in - then what's the sacrifice? or the tragedy? he leaves his fiancé and makes the false confession but it's not enough, dramatically. ed norton confesses to the police. then shoots himself in the mouth. that's sacrifice. the point of ""American Psycho"", i guess, is that he has no way to redeem himself and that's the tragedy. that would be fine if not for all the murders. and again, if they are in his head and he thinks they are real then he is not merely having a nervous breakdown (which he never really has) but he is psychotic and that's never dealt with. ""<br/><br/>Following is a response I wrote him in 2007: <br/><br/>Bateman is psychotic, which is all that is dealt with, in my opinion. Start with the title. And the fact that everything he does is nuts. Even his friends kind of think he's weird, and they're barely awake enough to recognize him. He is Tantalus, staring at his own reflection and failing to grasp it until he goes mad with coveting himself.<br/><br/>The joke of this story, I think, is a man trying desperately to have a tragedy, or a comedy, or any kind of a dramatic life, but he's just a doofus who happens to be very rich. He's Bruce Wayne without a good idea in his head. He's unable to really have, for instance, a sense of accomplishment, or a need unfulfilled, or a sense of loss, or values, really - since he's at the very, very top of Olympus, having achieved the top 2% of the planet in terms of resources (women and $100 plates and blow and limousines), he should be able to be happy. BUT THERE IS NO DRAMA IN HAVING EVERYTHING. So that's the comic premise: he can't have a tragedy, and he is driven mad by the attempt. The tragedy would be ""A Clockwork Orange"", a man so blasé and jaded that he follows the baser impulses of popular culture because it really doesn't matter what he does since society's such wreckage anyway, and whose real tragedy is that he actually can fulfill himself and be happy by doing evil, a more cynical sensibility than I think is found in ""American Psycho"".<br/><br/>At this point, I think there are two valid ways to look at what constitutes the story.<br/><br/>One is that he hasn't really committed these murders which should be horrific but aren't, and that he's having a nervous breakdown from trying so hard to transgress and being so impotent that his sex fantasies have become indistinguishable in his retarded mind from his real life. His fantasies, also, are not enough to make his life interesting; fantasies never are; and he is just an empty Lord & Taylor bag that a homeless man is using for a pillow. His friends see this, aren't interested enough to pity him, or, worse, think his confession is just a joke that they don't really get, so they kind of laugh along until their feelings are hurt. In trying to suffer punishment he only receives minor scorn. He is such a failure, a cipher, that even his crimes don't really exist. This is an okay interpretation, but less interesting than: <br/><br/>The other way you could look at it, which is that he's so desperate for passion and fulfillment that, like Hercules, he really did commit these crimes, but that AGAIN THERE ARE ZERO CONSEQUENCES. When he confesses and nobody believes him, and even when his friends offer evidence to the contrary, that's just because they're as stupid as he is, and that they mistook him for someone else and also mistook his victim for someone else and they're all interchangeable anyway, and that it's just too much trouble for these people even to help the detective find the murderer, since nobody really liked Paul Allen in the first place. Anyway they're all self-absorbed and inattentive to really important details, not like ""which restaurant shall we go to,"" which is a minor detail that's very important to them, but big details like ""who am I talking to?"" I think this is the funnier interpretation, and I think that the movie ends on enough of an ambiguous note to allow for it.<br/><br/>It is an imperfect film. It has great performances, many great scenes, a few very nice recurring themes, and many flaws. The disappearing detective is as you point out a problem. There is contempt in the lens, which I agree is to no one's advantage. I think we should see the guys hanging out more, see more of what pathetic losers they are, or more of how he's more or less screwed up than they. There is too much time spent with the character alone. To really get Travis Bickle's alienation, we don't only show him alone in his apartment playing G. Gordon and writing cryptic messages to himself. We show him at the movies.<br/><br/>But man, Christian Bale on the phone, talking to that answering machine. So beautiful. We are capable of so much, we humans. Now if we would only stop playing Batman so often."
"bastiaan0740","9","1","2","1 October 2008"," It hits its mark
","The movie itself has a weak plot. It's about a guy who kills people. Then the movie basically ends. So why is it so good?<br/><br/>Well, for starters the environment. All this insanity takes place with upper-class people. This adds a special dimension to the scenario. People are unable to acknowledge the situation, or deal with it - or they simply don't want to. Even Bateman himself. He can't control the murders, and even confessing them doesn't work. At the beginning, Bateman states he has no real persona. And indeed he hasn't got one. Odd thing is, having no personality, is a personality of its own. This angle is played out brilliantly. Bateman succeeds in interesting us with trivia on what lotions he uses, his feelings on business cards, apartment locations, and music preferences. Then he murders for no reason. Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is another masterpiece. He's on the hunt for the killer. After watching the movie, I read the trivia. It states Kimball's scenes were shot 3 times. One thinking Bateman was the killer. One thinking he wasn't. One not knowing either way. And all Kimball's present scenes were a mix. This is exactly how I perceived it, even before reading the trivia. It makes for a great effect. Kimball's tampered personality mixes great with Bateman's surreal one. The acting is brilliant as well. Bateman (Christian Bale) has no problem portraying the variety of extreme emotions. <br/><br/>9/10."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","29 September 2008"," A dense and bizarre psychological thriller
","Welcome to the mind of Patrick Bateman: Wall Street broker, fine diner, playboy, oh and serial killer extroadinare. Bateman claims only part of himself is based in humanity and similarly, only part of this film is based on reason or sanity.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is easily one of the top five most deranged films of all time. Those with a taste for the bizarre and an interest in the abstraction of realism will find it great, those who prefer movies grounded in, well, something, will at the very least be amused by the perverse nature of the plot and Bateman's psychotic character.<br/><br/>Christian Bale does some pretty great work with Bateman, giving us a very dissociative identity look to the clearly insane killer, showing him as very cold and crafty while also emotional and irrational. His character jumps all over the place and Bale really has the look and skills to play all those kinds of characters.<br/><br/>I have to say that while I like Mary Harron's visual choices with the film, overall I don't know if we got deep enough into the meddle that is this plot and the cavernous mind of Bateman. The thin line between reality/imagination, sanity/insanity is very clear, but the social commentary is sort of overshadowed by the film's taste for the absurd. I definitely think there's richness, but there is a lot of thickness too.<br/><br/>I suppose if you come at this film with a more abstract perspective than a desire to sort things out and make sense of them, you'll find more things to enjoy about the film other than Bateman's philosophical conversations about sellout recording artists while he indulges in one fantasy or another. It's strange, and while strange is good, strange also needs to be handled a bit more thoughtfully than in ""Psycho."""

","I think that I've hardly seen a movie that is capable of depicting just how ""man eats man"" nowadays. Maybe Sweeney Todd did but it was a musical comedy and I wouldn't compare that movie to American Psycho.<br/><br/>Still, what was disturbing about the movie is that every now and then, I could sympathize with the main ""protagonist"". I saw another movie with him as the 1st role and I have to say he was poor into it. This movie however told me not to judge an actor by a single movie. Sure sometimes he looked a little robotic but that's what happens when you're DIRECTED.<br/><br/>This movie shows all sorts of truths about the everyday man that sometimes, I feel like anyone could be the mad killer. Anyone could suddenly walk up and shoot an old lady in the chest or start a killing spree just because they ""felt like killing"". We're so very weak yet we're so very strong. We're given all the tools to be judge and guilty.<br/><br/>I found myself looking at the protagonist as some kind of hero, up until the end of the movie, where I found it almost cruel to see that all of this had been but in his mind. The girl opening up his note book seemed indication enough that this all had been nothing but Bateman's subconscious hacking at his mind. Driving him crazy with thoughts of mutilating women and using them as his sex slaves.<br/><br/>Then again, this is maybe what a ""hero"" is. That's all a hero could be in our time where anything is brought up as a grand event. From the slightest birth to the worse death. Everything is preached, even the serial killers are preached at some point. This is why this movie is so effective: People end up wanting to see him kill people. Hell, when I heard the movie was about a guy just killing people because he felt like it, I wanted to see it.<br/><br/>It's such a beautiful way to end this kind of fantastical adventure by telling you: ""Wouldn't you just like that? To think he's killed all these people and got away with it?"" I think even though I haven't spoken of the movie much, you should see it. It's a must for anyone having personal doubts about how well our society is currently built.<br/><br/>I'm a Canadian and I still was able to see the references to the American dream depicted within this movie. I paid more attention to how well the whole thing rolled, up till the credits I was on the edge of my seat, always wanting to see more.<br/><br/>A let-down some might say? I think it was more like a slap to the face."

","This movie had great vision and some really good ideas, but it just did not pull it off. This movie is filled with great little moments, but as a whole it did come together. Christian Bale was brilliant and there was nothing wrong with him, but the rest of the movie was not there. The opening scene was awesome, but almost too cliché. They did explore the decent into madness very well. The violence was not over the top which was nice, but I think if they should more of the murders it would have been better in the end. Not that they needed to actually show the blood or gore, but to add show him killing people. The whole police aspect of the movie was not put together well and I did not feel at any point that he was a threat. They could have done without it or they could have expanded on it. As it stood it did not work for me. For me I don't think that there was that much confusion on the ending. I do no think he killed Jared Leto's character, but did end up killing people, but because he was crazy he was not able to keep things straight in his head. The best scene was the opening scene followed by his sex scene where he was flexing. I also loved the dialog of about the music. It felt as if it read right our a review (as it was supposed to) and just added to the fact that he was not human capable of normal human emotion. Overall not a great movie, but Christian Bale saved it from being even lower for me. There were great ideas and maybe in someone else's hands it could have been a masterpiece."

","This is a finely constructed allegory for all that is dark and horrible about the excesses of modernity, as epitomized by a yuppie stockbroker, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as he descends into his insanity.<br/><br/>You see, Patrick doesn't exist in reality: he only exists, in the minds of others, as a cardboard cutout  much like his exquisite business card that doesn't quite cut it when compared to his friends'  who occupies a vacuous space in his vacuous office where he goes through the vacuous motions of doing vacuous business in a vacuous world...<br/><br/>And, all the while, Patrick's frustrations, doubts, self-loathing and contempt for the world all mix together in his mind to produce the only outlet he can generate: supreme anger at a system that must be cleansed, and violently.<br/><br/>So, he goes on a secret killing spree  removing office competitors, prostitutes, drunks, deadbeats, ex-lovers and whoever else takes his fancy. Precisely clinical in his office at work, at the bar with his friends, or at dinner with his fiancée or lover, Patrick executes  the very operative word  all those dregs of society with the same dispassionate disdain that he holds for the world in general.<br/><br/>Bale is simply superb in this role, one that must have been very difficult to portray; little wonder that he was nominated for a good number of awards (he won a Best Actor award). Kudos (and awards!) also goes to the scriptwriters, Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, for a clever and witty narrative. I've not read the book, but now I think I should, despite all the bad press from long ago.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a horror story; but the horror is not in the violence that, for the most part and when compared to other films, is muted. The real horror is that which occurs in Patrick's psyche, as he tries to sort out the fictions of the real world from the reality of his fictional and insane world. Hence, as a viewer, it's often difficult to sort out those things also...which is perhaps the major sub-text of this story when applied to the world in which we all live, whatever our worlds are. Sure, the story is over-the-top, but it's a satire as well as an allegorical tour-de-force; so, treat it as such.<br/><br/>It's not for every body, that's for sure, and certainly not for adolescents. As adults, however, we should all welcome a narrative such as this, to allow our own mind to dwell upon the issues raised, which are many as well as varied. For example, how often have I said to somebody, in jest: ""Don't do that, or I'll kill you""? This story examines that type of behavioral idea - with a vengeance.<br/><br/>The production is slick, as it should be on Wall Street, glitzy restaurants and sumptuous surrounds; the supporting cast is equal to Bale's performance, but there's no doubt he dominates, as he should in this role; and it was great to listen to some good oldies from Phil Collins and others.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for adults who aren't afraid to look within this narrative...and perhaps within themselves."

I would hope that people who have only seen this movie once and didn't care for it should watch it again and think in the context of a comedy- my two cents. I though that the screenplay was fantastic, especially the dialogue. Another thing that intrigued me was how the director used close-ups to capture the essence of the comdeic value that certain aspects of scenes contained. This use of heightened drama makes me laugh out loud every time I watch this film.

","I have read many comments and I have to say that many (here) just analyze this masterpiece from a reductive point of view : the first degree. I do believe you cannot fully appreciate ""American psycho"" if you only see a man in Bateman. Indeed, in this story, every character represents a symbol.<br/><br/>One, in a previous comment, has said that Patrick represents the American Dream. This is interesting. To my point of view, he represents the most ugly face of America. Not the one who helps the poor, not the one who respects women, not the one who will be able able to love somebody else than himself. He is America when there is no human dimension anymore.<br/><br/>Bateman then can kill this poor guy in the street, some whores. As well, he cannot love his girlfriend. On the contrary, he will consider himself as a kind of God and will respect nobody else. Then this scene at the restaurant when he is among friends and talk about social progress is so funny.<br/><br/>Watch the movie and ask yourself : ""What character is an exception to Bateman's insanity?"" ""Which person is offered to him but not killed?"" Then you will see that this person is the secretary. The America of the 80's was very racist (the Reagan's years), don't we forget it. This young wasp-typed lady is the only one to escape safely to Patrick's madness.<br/><br/>It is not by simple chance that the movie finishes with Ronald Reagan on TV and Patrick's partners commenting his speech. All is here. Nothing has happened even if Bateman's nightmare was real. The craziness of the 80's (the money decade) is illustrated by Bateman. This is some kind of fable and allegory. This is how I understand it. ""There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing..."" are the last words and a the author denies, in a last ironic eruption, the quality of his superb work.<br/><br/>Mary Harron has done a great job<br/><br/>Christian Bale is amazing<br/><br/>Bret Easton Ellis is a genius.

"omgpressure","6","1","2","16 August 2007"," Enjoyable.
","American Psycho is a very elegantly produced film. It features some excellent photography, and it's a gripping experience. It is not a film that will one-day be seen as a classic of cinema, but it is enjoyable and entertainingly obscene, watching ""American Psycho"" is like witnessing a bravura sleight-of-hand feat. In adapting Bret Easton Ellis's turgid, gory 1991 novel to the screen, the director Mary Harron has boiled a bloated stew of brand names and butchery into a lean and mean horror comedy classic. The transformation is so surprising that when the movie's over, it feels as if you've just seen a magician pull a dancing rabbit out of a top hat. <br/><br/>Four years ago Ms. Harron's film ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" performed similar magic by creating credible facsimiles of Warhol and his motley entourage. ""American Psycho,"" a more ambitious, far more confident film, salvages a novel widely loathed for its putative misogyny and gruesome torture scenes by removing its excess fat in a kind of cinematic liposuction. Except for a few wittily chosen lists, the book's numbing catalog of high-end consumer items has been drastically edited. Its murder rate has also plunged. The trimming demonstrates once again that less is often more. What remains of the story is a sleek, satirical, yuppie-era ""Jekyll and Hyde"" that blithely tap dances along the fault lines separating movie genres. At the heart of the film is a star-making performance by the handsome Welsh actor Christian Bale (adopting an impeccably snooty pseudo-preppie American accent) that softens the novel's portrait of a serial-killing Wall Street hotshot just enough to force us to identify with this ultimate narcissist. Mr. Bale's portrayal of 27-year-old Patrick Bateman, a budding master of the universe by day (he works in mergers and acquisitions, which he facetiously refers to as ""murders and executions"") and homicidal maniac by night, is alternately funny, blood-curdling and pathetic. American Psycho is not for all tastes, but for ones that enjoy a good thriller and can stomach blood curdling violence."

Smacked in the middle is wall Street Buisnessman Patrick Bateman. He wears expensive suits, is pedantic about taking care of his body and constantly tries to get a reservation at the trendy restaurant Dorsia. But underneath the surface, Patrick Bateman is a shell. He may have flesh, blood skin and bone, but inside, he is simply not there. He describes hi,self only being able to feel two emotions, greed and disgust, two feelings which drive him to commit acts of gruesome violence in the night.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is played perfectly by Christian Bale, who earlier had been in ""Empire of The Sun"" by Steven Spielberg. He gives the character depth and humor and gives excellent speeches, on one hand delivering sick remarks in ordinary conversations, and on the other recollecting careers of Pop-stars such as Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis and Whitney Houston. Patrick's equally shallow friends are played by Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas and Bill Sage among others. Patrick's supposed fiancée is played by Reese Witherspoon who does an annoying portrait of a woman who only cares about what people think of her. But she is supposed to be annoying, so it's okay. Cloe Sevigny plays Jean, Patrick secretary who has a crush on him. She is the only not shallow person in this story, which is probably why Patrick cant bring himself to kill her. Jared Leto also makes an appearance as Paul Allen, the only one of Patrick's acquaintances who can get a reservation at Dorsia. This, plus the fact that he has a better looking business card is probably why he gets an Axe smacked in his face by Bateman.<br/><br/>This movie, despite the aspect of the murders, is very funny. Hilarious scenes such as Chrsitian Bale's moonwalk during a murder scene, or a three-some where he flexes in the mirror during the act are stacked on each other, and you will find yourself laughing out loud during several scenes.<br/><br/>The translation from Bret Easton Ellis masterful novel is done great, and a lot of the things in the book are in the Movie, with the exception of the most gruesome scenes (who i wont mention here). Several Narrating speeches are in.<br/><br/>Conclusion, a brilliant piece of cinema, with great performances all around. Oh, and i almost forgot Willhelm Dafoe's character, the PI Donald Kimball. He gives of a very creepy vibe, and makes both the audience and Bateman feel nervous. Awesome performance.<br/><br/>""Do you like Huey Lewis And The News?""<br/><br/>10/10"

","Patrick Bateman is 27 years old. He's rich, he works on Wall Street, and he's a psycho who likes to kill people. He isn't a person, or so he tells us. He can't feel any emotions, except for disgust and greed.<br/><br/>There are several great scenes in the film. In one of them, Bateman argues that Phil Collins' ""In Too Deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 80's. He argues that Genesis pre-1980 were too artsy, and that Phil Collins' commercial attitude and solo career saved Genesis, made them a great band. He does this all while preparing two prostitutes for sex and with a single expression on his face. Just before he gets to 'work' he turns on ""Ssubio"", calling it a great, great song. Of course, this is all brilliant satire on 80's society. Patrick Bateman is boring and conformist, like everything else in that 'wonderful' decade, such a wild contrast to the revolutionary society of the 70's and 90's. It is little nuances like this that give me such a huge appreciation for the screenplay and. An understanding of 80's pop culture will greatly enhance your viewing experience because as relevant as this is to our world today, it is a period piece and though it is a vicious attack on human banality and our conformist ways, it uses the prime example of this (the 80's) as its way of getting its point across. <br/><br/>Where else do you see a man hacking another to pieces set to the tune of Huey Lewis' ""Hip to Be Square""? That scene might just have the single greatest song choice I've seen in a film. Perfectly describing the banality of yuppie life in the 1980's and serving as the soundtrack for a vicious act of rather unnecessary violence, the scene is grotesque and almost scary, but still utterly brilliant and viciously funny. Another standout scene is near the end as Bateman blurts out a confession of his crimes to his lawyer through a phone message. <br/><br/>In many ways it is the musical choices made by Mary Harron that accentuate the film's satire. Besides Bale's performance and the gorgeous photography, it is the soundtrack, packed with bland, soulless, empty pop music that pushes this film over the top. Some detractors call the film too violent, too over-the-top, too vile and disgusting. This is not true. Every single moment of the film is warranted. It is a vicious satire, never intended to be subtle.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

","'American Psycho' is one of those rare films which stand up to multiple viewings and remain fresh and funny each time. It is a social satire, easily in the league of 'Fight Club' and 'American Beauty,' which points an accusing finger at the rampant materialism and shallow values of 1980s America. <br/><br/>Christian Bale gives an absolutely dynamic and hilarious performance as Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who masquerades as a businessman/playboy by day and moonlights as a serial killer. The story is embellished with regular voice overs from Bateman, revealing his obsessions with such matters as who is wearing what, who has the best haircut and who has the best business card. <br/><br/>Patrick Bateman; ""I'm on the verge of tears as we arrive as Espace... since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.""<br/><br/>Bale plays Bateman like a man who is constantly starring in his own movies - action/adventure, horror, porn and drama; and for whom others in his world are merely co-stars. But like any psychopathic maniac, underneath there is nothing there.<br/><br/>'American Psycho' is a perfect viewing experience for those who love an intelligent movie with first rate acting all round. Willem Dafoe makes a classic appearance as the cop who may or may not suspect Patrick; Reece Witherspoon is his shallow, airhead fiancée who is so busy planning the wedding that she doesn't notice that Patrick treats her with total indifference; Jared Leto is Patricks' idiotic Wall Street colleague, and the subject of his homicidal envy (he sports a really funny 80's hairdo); and Chloe Sevigny is Patricks' sweet natured, blindly infatuated secretary.<br/><br/>The film is not for those offended by sex or violence (though the violence is not particularly graphic - more implied). I can thoroughly recommend it though, just for Bales performance - which is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. He is an actor with extraordinary range, who can play the ego-maniacal Patrick Bateman with as much ease as he plays childish innocence (as in 'All the Little Animals)."

In fact some scenes, which in essence should be ""horror"" are quite hilarious (referring to, for example, a certain scene with a chainsaw) and make the movie as a whole a bit lighter than it could have been.<br/><br/>However, if you see this movie and hope to see another great movie by watching part 2: don't.

Beneath this business school success story, however, lies a dark man who knows and even acknowledges that he has everything, but wants more...<br/><br/>Since this is an adaptation you can see this movie as too different things: as an adaptation of the novel, or as just a movie if you haven't read the novel. As a movie it is well done, especially with Bale's frightening performance as the callous Bateman, and it is that with the general ambition that went into the project that overshadows the film's obvious limitations. And there are quite a few of them. I have never read the book, but have heard about it enough to see that the film is aesthetically way below the scope of the novel. The locations and sets simply just barely manage to cut it. However the film is a success due its tone.<br/><br/>The themes, metaphors, and idea of the book presented in such a way that you get the feeling that yes, the filmmakers know the source material, like the source material and put in an honest effort to get it translated to the screen. After all, it is the themes and ideas that matter more than the actual physical look of the film. ""Apocalypse Now"" looks nothing like Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" - different time period, different locations, etc... - but the fundamental themes of the novel (the stuff that matters most) are there and it is a great movie based off of a great book. With ""American Psycho"" fans can delight in the adaptation as also being faithful in the aesthetic sense.<br/><br/>However, fans should also be ready to forgive. Think about it, would any major studio release a movie with a seriously f***ed up lead character like Bateman? Author Bret Easton Ellis was himself shot down by publishers before he got his book out, so this isn't mainstream thought and metaphor here. It is un-PC, hard to swallow, but daring in it's ambitions and that is what makes the film good. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong violent content and sex"
"lizardluv","9","1","2","2 December 2006"," If you're confused by the ending...
","My take on the ending is that the last killings are so over-the-top there is confusion (intentional) about what is real and what might be in Bateman's head. But it doesn't matter, the underlying theme becomes clear regarding yuppie excess, and the soulless, emptiness and insanity exhibited throughout the movie. <br/><br/>I didn't read the book (and I realize the book is more intense/brutal, etc) but the film gets its point across. What are we really laughing at here? What reflection is presented about American society, class, and bourgeois culture? Seeing how this was set in 1987, during the Reagan years, this film is every bit relevant today, and more so.<br/><br/>My 3¢"
"leeeep","10","1","2","13 November 2006"," This movie ruled my face off
","Though the book was incredible, Christian Bale nails it. I think I know every single line from this movie by heart because it absolutely rules. If you haven't seen it, you need to. You'll laugh your head off at the way Patrick Bateman reacts toward everything. He is, I believe, so obsessive compulsive that it drives him to insanity. The end will have you guessing the major question - did he really do it? It's a flawless ending and I'll leave it up to the viewer to decide whether or not he committed such acts of inhumanity or if it was all just one hoax conjured in the mind of Patrick Bateman. That is why it is my favorite movie of all time and I hope that you can appreciate American Psycho as much as I have.<br/><br/>-lee"

","I first saw this film in the theater and left shaking my head in confusion. Some time later I saw the movie again, and thereafter I have watched it dozens of times (each time picking up on something I never noticed before).<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays an Ivy League graduate working at a prestigious firm in mid-80's New York. He has everything going for him: perfect looks, perfect job, perfect apartment, perfect fiancé played by Reese Witherspoon, but for every perfect element in his life comes a comparison to someone else with better looks (he is often compared another person as a mistaken identidy in which he is offended. Not even his lawyer calls him by the right name), better job (although they are all VP's of the company, yet Jared Leto's character for example always gets the ""good accounts""), better apartment (more expensive, better location), or a better fiancé (Samantha Mathis' character being engaged to a seemingly obvious homosexual).<br/><br/>Everything Bale and the rest of the cast of characters do revolves around ""fitting in"". The night clubs, the coke habits, the luncheons at the best restaurants. In a large part of the scenes we see how society at that time behaves ($500 or so for a lunch in which they all say ""not bad"" and each provide a credit card, the memorable business card comparison scene which nearly gives Bale a heart attack). Culture and materialism is picked a part in the movie in a very comedic way.<br/><br/>Bale spends most of his time pretending to be someone he's not (fake smiles, fake enjoyment at a Christmas party). However, the movie portrays that in his off time he is picking up hookers only to sleep with them (with praise of his good fortune expected) only to find himself enraged and compelled to murder his victims. Not limited to woman hating, he acts out on his jealousy towards a co-worker all while playing Huey Lewis soundtracks as he seems to be passionate about his 80's music and culture. A homeless man and various animals are even incorporated into his list of victims.<br/><br/>He is able to withstand temptation of his ""friends"" and more surprisingly his secretary who he invites on a date only to let her leave unscathed. William Dafoe plays a detective who catches him in his lies and confusion.<br/><br/>The film ends in a very eerie way as we don't know if any of the experiences with Bale were real or in his mind. He went from odd behaving to absolutely crazy and the facts are not even facts, but scattered thoughts or undefined realities.<br/><br/>It's one of the few ""horror"" films I couldn't help but chuckle at throughout the entire sick and twisted duration."
"user-11512","8","1","2","24 October 2006"," as a business major in accounting and finance this movie is disturbingly realistic
","I am majoring in accounting and corporate finance and this movie sorta hits home in the fact of how fast-moving and emotionally detached the business world is from love, happiness, and consideration. Christian Bale accurately plays a businessman involved in world where money is taken for granted, massive amounts of money, appearance is everything (read The Prince by Machiavelli), and no one cares to even know each others name, nonetheless look each other in the eyes. No one looks out for each other as each businessman essentially looks out for himself and little else. This type of environment allows sociopaths, OCD manics, and psychopathic and serial tendencies to thrive. The treatment Christian Bale receives and more so dishes out to middle and poor classes and even his own rich class is ruthless and horrifying. The movie leaves you feeling very uneasy and distrusting of the big business corporate world, i take this personally too since i am heading into this corporate nightmare. I recommend this film very much, don't watch it as a date movie if your trying to get close to your partner, it kills moods because the film most likely will not leave you feeling any type of good. In a nut shell this film will leave you thinking heavily about how sick and disillusioned the prisoners of corporate America's world can become."
"MiracleDrug","10","1","2","11 October 2006"," Underrated as hell
","It has the same dark hum-our as A Clockwork Orange and Christian Bale is absolutely brilliant. It's a film you don't like the first time you see it. Probably, you hate it. Yet, after a few viewings you see the brilliant, dark hum-our in it. It's absolutely hilarious to see Bateman slaughtering people, but in the next scene noticing that all he really cares about is returning his videotapes on time or that someone has a better businesscard.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman lives in a lot of people in a way. Lots of people don't give *beep* about other people, just care about there possessions and mostly themselves. In this aspect American Psycho touches a lot of the same grounds as say Fight Club.<br/><br/>Just as the main character of Clockwork Orange, you are shocked and terrified of Bateman because he is an embodiement of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. Or at least a lot of them anyway.<br/><br/>yet, Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange are seen as two of the greatest movies ever and this movie only gets a 6.9 People should dare to see beyond there disgust. Maybe that's why they don't like it, it reflects too much of themselves. It scares the hell out of them. It's like looking in a mirror and they don't like the reflection.<br/><br/>I truly hope in time this movie will get the appreciation it deserves."

","This movie is very interesting probe into mind of mentally sick man with very wide imagination suffering from intellectual solitude and psychical underflow. This picture could be shown only thanks to brilliant performance of Christian Bale. It was interesting to track man without any emotions, just with one intensive feeling - commit violence, strictly speaking - kill people - sometimes well-considered and sometimes spontaneously. The edge between madness and normality is usually very narrow so this movie could be also in a way some kind of warning for people living with similar social style. I would like to recommend this movie to all who likes dealing with deepness of human soul."

His quotes are amazing. A very addictive accent also. And most guys would love to be him Maybe take away the serial killer life and he is a perfect human.

"mjw2305","8","1","2","6 February 2006"," A faithful translation to the big screen?
","Ever read the book? Hard work wasn't it? <br/><br/>I don't mean this as an insult to 'Bret Easton Ellis' work, he simply had to use this intense attention to detail to deliver us the character of Bateman. So i for one was very pleased to find that this was carried over to film successfully (apart from the glaring omission of the violence and gore).<br/><br/>Mary Harron, bravely chose to leave these scenes to suggestion, running the risk of reprisal from critics everywhere.<br/><br/>Did Mary Harron chose correctly? I say absolutely yes! <br/><br/>Given the relatively low budget of the film, the complexity of the story and the characters and the difficulty in displaying such harrowing and sick sexual and murderous visuals, 'American Psycho' could have quite easily become a very disjointed slasher movie, and thankfully it doesn't.<br/><br/>Instead 'American Psycho' is a wonderfully satirical look at Yuppie life in the 80's, and the idea of living the dream at the expense of the soul. Christian Bale captures the character of Bateman with perfection, and he takes us on the decent into madness with him.<br/><br/>Overall this is a faithful translation to the big screen, which is in many ways more entertaining than the book. My thanks to Mary Harron and Christian Bale for this achievement.<br/><br/>8/10"
"morphion2","9","1","2","25 January 2006"," Not To Be Judged By Its Cover
","Before acclaimed author Brett Easton Ellis had even published ""American Psycho"" in 1992, the novel had generated great controversy, receiving heated protest from women's groups and death threats against Ellis. It's no surprise, then, that it was adapted to film less than ten years later, complete with rather graphic allusions to all sorts of sordid acts. What may come as a surprise, however, is that it also bore an edgy sense of intelligence, one that would perhaps further horrify some viewers, but nonetheless prove provocative.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is, in many respects, the perfect American man. He is 27 years old, in fabulous physical shape, he is handsome and intellectual and successful; he shares a Vice Presidency at a very important business on Wall Street. He has a fiancé, is well respected and well off. His only flaw, aside from a conditioned obsession with self-image, is that for reasons decidedly undefined, he is absolutely, irreparably, violently insane. Said insanity becomes increasingly evident over the course of the film, illustrated by Bateman's frequent surreal sex romps and horrific butcherings, for which he feels next to no remorse.<br/><br/>The film's deceptively simplistic title and premise perhaps deliberately sell it short as a senseless gore-fest. ""American Psycho"" is, quite simply, more than that. It is a challenge, a threat, a spit in the face of a society that promotes anti-individualism and bland conformity in the egotistical pursuit of a presupposed perfect existence, while accommodating brutal acts and sick attitudes of all kinds. Sure it's disturbing, sure it's offensive, but it's also the best dark satire of American culture since ""Fight Club"", and it is damn proud of it.<br/><br/>For this, we have two very important people to thank. The first is director Mary Harron, whose perceptive vision saw this project from potential catastrophe to a level for more intelligent and meaningful. Harron's take on the twisted story is considered and appropriate, delighting in subtle mockery but carrying a more serious agenda as well. She expertly intersperses horror and comedy, while managing to steer clear of anything gratuitous or cheap.<br/><br/>The second hero of the piece is star Christian Bale. With expressed interest in the lead part from the likes of Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio, some might have considered sticking with the lesser known Bale as a risk. They may have been right, but one thing's for sure; he was the perfect man for the job. He is sensational, superb, sublime and any other alliterate praise there is. His perfect rendering of a character forced to fake almost every facet of humanity, an effectual vacuum of emotion is by and large the most intriguing thing about the film. His uncanny ability to make the horrific humorous cements the viewers' interest in what might otherwise repel them; a terrific performance from Bale that illustrates a talent only hinted at in some of his later, more mainstream work like ""Batman Begins"".<br/><br/>For those who prefer their laughs guiltless, or their interest not bordering quite so much on disgust, then perhaps ""American Psycho"" is not for you. It's no secret that depictions of brutal violence and sickening themes don't hit the top at the box office. But an open mind goes a long way in the world of film, and it is controversial pictures like this one that continue to remind us why."
"mdumouch-1","10","1","2","13 January 2006"," A brilliantly misunderstood film...
","If I were to tell anyone anything about the film, American Psycho, it would simply be ""do not take this film at face value"". This is an homage to a time in history. However recent the 80s may have been, they are still a definitive time period, very unlike today. This film takes great lengths to explore the decadence and opulence of the boom in culture that occurred in the 1980s. The movie focuses its story on one man, Patrick Bateman, and his existence in this neon lit, over saturated, pop music world. We are given little as to how Bateman became who he is, but we do enter his life at a time which could only best be described as his ""breaking point"". How this breakdown occurs and really what it results in is very open to debate as you will find, but I urge you to view this film and interpret, do not simply watch. It is a truly original and intelligent piece of work and the horror the film produces is equaled if not topped by both its wit and satire. Christian Bale is brilliant as is the supporting cast. The only negative that has resulted from this film is a very bad sequel that seems to have clearly missed the point of the first film."
"hblo2234","8","1","2","9 January 2006"," An excellent work
","I saw ""American Psycho"" for the first time when I was younger. I didn't think to highly of it then, and I now know the reason. When I was younger, I could not understand the complexity of this movie, and the character ""Patrick Bateman."" And now, after seeing it again recently, I can truly appreciate this movie for the work of art it is. There is so much more to be read between the lines in this movie then in most others, it's one of those movies you can see 100 times, and still find something new that you missed every other time, and enjoy it all the more. Bale plays his role so well I think, I have read the book, and I think that he is perfect for the character. Though the book is MUCH more graphic, I think the lack of graphic violence in this movie actually goes in favor of it. It allows us to focus on the other things one could so easily pass up. If you have not seen this movie, you must go rent it, especially if you are somebody who enjoys GOOD MOVIES. not your average Vin Diesel flick. The eccentric character of Patrick Bateman is what this movie is about. It is the only ""horror"" movie I can look back on, and say, I have never laughed so hard from this, and not in a cheesy way, in a very good way. GO SEE THIS MOVIE"
"tom666","10","1","2","16 December 2005"," He's twisted, psycho, crazy and handsome.. Just the way I like it..
","What can I say?... I love this movie so much! It's just so twisted, crazy and psycho as a movie just can get. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times and I just can't get enough. There's something terrifying but also fascinating in this masterpiece. I like the way Christian Bale turns pretty-boy Patrick Bateman into a psychotic killer and finally over-comes his image as decent guy from next door. Great example of it is that his own psychologist wont even believe him.. He hides his bodies and finally gets away clean. Anyway I'm a huge fan of Christian Bales and I think that this is one of his best! But also movies like Equilibrium, El Maquinista, Reign of fire and of course Batman Begins are good. Christian Bale is just the kind of an actor who does a lot for his character. Can you imagine someone who could act Batman/ Bruce Wayne, Patrick Bateman or priest John Preston better than him. I can't! Hope we'll see much more Christian Bale-movies!"
"noralee","7","1","2","12 December 2005"," very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary on the '80's
","Seeing ""American Psycho"" right after ""High Fidelity"" is like going through a fun-house mirror, as it's a warped, caustic view of many of the same issues ""HF"" deals with humorously and with humanity. <br/><br/>The monologues on pop music are disarmingly similar, but here they are just foreplay for uncontrollable hate and blood lust as a way to try to poke through them for feeling, as if it's ripping through Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" video for blood.<br/><br/>I have no idea about what the original book is like, but this is a ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" of the single '80's set. One weakness is that we don't actually see the interchangeable yuppies work so we don't see the testosterone rush at work that is so frightening in ""Boiler Room"" and would have added more tension and maybe even explanation here, where all we hear is that ""Mergers & Acquisitions"" is synonymous for the lead character to ""murders and executions."" They are all so interchangeable (shades of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" taking over Jude Law's character) that I was really not sure of what is real or fantasy when others keep saying that he must be mistaken about murdering a co-worker when they met with him.<br/><br/>The lead character, played beautifully narcissistically by Christian Bale, is equally murdering men and women here, so the misogyny charges filed against the book don't apply here, and he's equally unfeeling to both. But as he breaks down, the irony is that he's not unfeeling about his crimes--the rest of the people around him are.<br/><br/>It's a very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary.<br/><br/>(originally written 4/15/2000)"

","American Psycho is in my opinion the best horror film out there, there have been many good horror films such as The Shining and Sleepy Hollow but American Psycho is the only one I could consider a great movie. American Psycho is such a scary and disturbing film in many ways. It is one of those films that just ignores the Hollywood idea of having a nice rounded out ending that leaves no room for thought. American Psycho is just nothing like that, you will think one heck of a lot. Christen Bales performance is just amazing, he gives one of the best performances in years, he is just phenomenal. The other performances by actors like William Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon are also fine. The film is also admirably directed and written with great dialogue and characters. The visual effects are also great, everything looks real and is just amazing. I loved American Psycho and think anyone who will not have major trouble with some of the gore and sex scenes, and just generally how disturbing and scary it is will love it too."

","When i first saw this movie, i didn't know what to expect, and after viewing it, i was confused and didn't know what to think. Was it a slasher movie? was a comedy? was it a horror movie? what did i just see. I read up on it some and found out that it was mostly a satire about the economic boom of the 80s rightly called ""reagan-economics"" and what one man goes through when he really can do anything he wants because he is so powerful and rich. It goes into things like respect of women and how men in the 80s cared more about what they wore, the way they looked and the music they listened to more than ever. Batemans rant about Phil Collins and his music right before he doubled up on a pair of hookers should go down in cinema history. Christian Bale gives a stellar performance here. Every time i see him in a movie now days, i just think back to American Psycho as his really star making performance. If you want to see someone put on an acting clinic, check out his performance. Fans of the book, should be happy, i haven't read it but i hear from people that have, say it is more like the book than not like other movies that are based on books. If you are a Bale fan you will be greatly pleased as this is the movie that he will probably be remembered for, also Batman Begins, but thats another story."

Indeed, he saves the movie; everyone else is decent, but play like back-up singers to Chirstian Bale's main show. The way he portrayed Patrick in such subtleties and quiet complexities perfectly compliments the character, and he certainly seems to have enjoyed playing the part.<br/><br/>American Psycho is actually a much more worthwhile film than the cheap trailer would have one suspect: the trailer plays as a cheap slasher flick, whereas the violence is almost second party to the satire of the 80's and yuppie way of life. Particulalrly memorable in my mind is the scene where Patrick is in the men's room and manages to goad the man in the next stall enough to stick his head over and demand ""Do you mind?! I am trying to drugs here!"" such is the chagrin of his disturbance.<br/><br/>The film is also vaguely comical (not least of all in the scene where Patrick entertains Paul in his apartment. All together now: ""Hey Paul! AHHHHHHHH!"") and is just light enough to keep the violence in equal balance.<br/><br/>Without this vaguely comical tone, which in turn adds the absurdity I spoke of, the violence would be exploitative. However, some of the film is quite disturbing, and I'd recommend that all conservatives stay clear of this.<br/><br/>However, certainly see it for Christian Bale's brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Avoid the incredibly lackluster sequel.<br/><br/>7/10"
"jrfranklin01","6","1","2","7 February 2005"," Apt Title
","Christian Bale lets his dark side out to play in this thriller about a playboy gone delusional. Bale plays the renowned Patrick Bateman but is cast in a much different setting - corporate America. While not given any background as to his psychotic break, Bateman appears to us initially through his stream-of-consciousness, in which we get to hear what is going on inside his head. By day Bateman is the son a corporate mogul, but by night he is fueled by his insatiable carnal and murderous cravings. The corporate world in which he lives in is portrayed as being grossly decadent, full of nothing but materialism and foolish pride. But Bale's intense desire to maintain appearances and be the perfect facade or image of what people are looking for, make him all the more dangerous. Underneath the surface, his hold on reality begins to slip away. His introverted nature cares only for his pride as he competes against his coworkers and fulfills his sexual ego in his relations with several whores. When he loses touch with reality and the consequences of his actions, the blood begins to flow.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is a unique look at how people have different sides to their personality, some of which are scarily schizophrenic. It gives us a bizarre behind-the-scenes look at a very disturbed individual, much like the film ""One Hour Photo"", although I wouldn't say ""American Psycho"" has as much creepy plausibility. 4/10"

"joedamato-1","7","1","2","17 December 2004"," As realistic as it gets
","American psycho is black comedy  the ""pulp fiction"" of horror/thriller genre with Christian Bale's excellent performance. <br/><br/>As believable as it gets! <br/><br/>Bale's character Patrick Bateman's does nothing but renting horror movies, bringing prostitutes into his house, having sex and taping it, figuring out what kind of visit card to have, doing presses each morning, doing face masks, taking care of his body's handsomeness. One day he meets Paul Allen. This guy somehow pisses Patrick off. Patrick invites him to see his place and axes. For the fans of the original ""Texas chainsaw massacre 74"", there's a pleasant surprise  it's one of Patrick's favorites here There's an episode Patrick's doing exercises watching it. Later he'll ""use"" the chainsaw himself. Perhaps some of you will find ""American psycho"" lame, but it's really deep. The point is  one day Patrick realizes that he's nobody in this life and when he sees a homeless man with a dog, he is mostly afraid of the same thing will happen to him. And he commits his first murder. I just hated that part. Despite of that scene, the rest of movie has a really slight violence. I say the general part makes black comedy. The scene where Patrick completely naked holding a chainsaw pursues his favorite hooker after she sees the dead bodies is funny. This film can be understood many ways, but the main moral I think is  one don't have to be look like a degenerate, walk with a saw, kitchen knife or an ax under the coat, wear a mask or somebody's skinned face (like Leatherface) to be a maniac killer. The only problem is the seduction of this film. Don't get me wrong, but it has some. Really!"
"EighthSense","Null","1","2","5 November 2004"," My take
","The film uses symbolism to describe multiple things, i.e the social climate, as well as the Bateman character inside and out. He's externally appearing as hip and successful. Internally, he knows he's just a little schmuck among other little schmucks, who all ""promote"" themselves to Vice Presidents of one of many firms on Wall Street. Those in the brokerage business know that titles as ""President"" or ""Vice President"" on business cards are just written to impress clients. A one-man business office, can have a card that reads 'President"" even if he lives at the poverty level. Bateman is aware of his precarious, inferior, real status, and tries to shore up his inner fear of failure by external props and obsessions, such as dress, grooming, ability to make reservations at expensive places, etc. He can only ""defeat"" those weaker than him and all his victories happen in his fantasy, as a defense mechanism against his strong sense of inadequacy. Anytime he gets put-down or made to feel small in any way, he becomes (inside) a raging, fearful, trembling little guy, and -to compensate-indulges in orgies of ""power fantasies of murder and omnipotence"" which he expesses by sketching them out in his calendar,kept at his desk drawer. I believe that the pages of his calendar his secretary finds, are the clue to what's really going on with Bateman. The camera closes-up on the pages, almost empty, with one or two appointments penciled-in per day, sometimes none(meaning very few clients, which means very little money), further showing one grisly drawing, which becomes more and more such drawings as the days and months go on. I believe that his increasing anxiety and anger over the measly business he was generating is exressed in those drawings. His self-defense is fantasizing of himself as all powerful, above all others, and he draws it-he fantasizes all the time, and he snaps under the tension: He can't stop the ever-more violent fantasies, until he comes to believe them, feels the fear of being caught for his imaginary deeds, and tries to get help by confessing. Another clue is that his lawyer had seen the supposedly dead Paul Allen, which really tell us that the murder and the detective was only in Bateman's mind. It is as if the movie plays in two tracks at the same time, Bateman's head, and the true reality. It is heavily based on psychology and the pathological compensating mechanisms one can have for severe feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. Perhaps the movie wants to show us in the face of Bateman the broader view of today's success figures, who appear as beautiful, composed, and powerful as Bateman appeared, while inside they're aware of their limitations, which make them rage and worry."
"DarthBill","Null","1","2","8 October 2004"," Not for children
","Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a successful, dashingly handsome yuppie with a little ray of sunshine for a fiancé to whom he feels no real emotional attachment (Reese Witherspoon) while all the while cheating on her with her best friend (Samantha Mathis) and making comments to his secretary that she should really wear skirts and high heels instead of pants and flats. Bateman is also harboring a dark secret: he likes to kill people, regardless of whether they're homeless men, fellow yuppies or the slutty women he sleeps with. Why? No particular reason it seems, except perhaps that all the years of maintaining an outer image of success and perfection have taken their toll on his mental health and he finds that killing people is the only way out for him. But when he murders fellow yuppie Jared Leto and starts getting investigated by an underused Willem Dafoe's detective, things get sticky. <br/><br/>Based on a book that I haven't read and probably wouldn't want to read.<br/><br/>Bale gives a spirited performance as the lunatic yuppie out on a killing spree (probably one of the reasons he got tapped for the part of Batman by Christopher Nolan), but the film doesn't seem to know where its going and offers no real closure. <br/><br/>Not for all tastes. Keep out of the reach of little children."

","American Psycho. 4/10<br/><br/>American Psycho, a novel by Brett Eston Ellis is a wonderful piece of literature that I recommend to anybody who loves the lifestyle of single New Yorkers, is an Ellis fan, or who would like to get lost in a chilling fantasy. I would recommend American Psycho a film by Edward R. Pressman to anybody looking for a flick with mediocre acting, a pretty good 3-way sex scene, and good 80's clothes. After reading the novel in two weeks I was excited to watch the movie. Disappointing.<br/><br/>The movie is about Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a single New Yorker who is the vice president of Peirce & Peirce, a company on Wall Street. He detests his job and is disgusted by his materialistic friends, whom he is the most materialistic of all. His fiancée, Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) is pressuring him to get married, his secretary, Jean, is in love with him, and he is going insane.<br/><br/>I think the film did very well preserving the Bateman character and his twisted mind, but it nearly touched on all of the other characters. If I had not read the book (I probably wouldn't have rented the movie) I would have thought the characters weren't nearly well developed and I would have been confused. In my opinion, with the length of the scenes, I felt like certain scenes were only in there as an homage to the book. I felt the movie was trying to be too much like the book. Like the director and the screenwriter were afraid to add scenes or to even add dialogue. They just cut scenes and put ones in the movie that made no sense if one had not read the book. I did, however, like Bateman's monologue. <br/><br/>I did, however, like the door at the end that said THIS IS NOT AN EXIT. I liked how (like most horror movies) it didn't show a close up at the end with very dramatic music. It was there for those who read the book, but if you hadn't you wouldn't have known what it said. In conclusion, if you have read the novel, it is worth watching, if not (unless you are a big Newsies fan) don't bother. It really only has the effect of a bad, uneventful, 80's horror movie."
"darkcarrington","Null","1","2","5 August 2003"," Average Horror Movie
","The interesting thing about this movie, was how the movie seemed to lose my focus the further it progressed.  The beginning of the movie was excellent, and gave an intriguing background to the main character of the story. However, as the movie progressed.  There seem to be two different kinds of horror movies in my book.  First, there are the kinds with either ""tasteful"" violence or no violence and really rely on the ability of the director to produce the great effects of the movie.  The other type is the gruesome bloodbath variety, which is acceptable in a movie in which it is necessary. American Psycho had violence that really isn't best described as a bloodbath, but more along the lines of 8MM, the truly utterly disturbing and disgusting variety.  Dismembered corpses and people being hacked to death make sporadic appearences in the movie, but they really do not have much of an effect other than to impose the gore of the movie.  This movie really tries to be a tasteful blood bath, which doesn't work out in theory or practice, and suffers because of it.<br/><br/>That being said, Christian Bale does a good if not great job.  However, much of the other acting in the movie is uninspired and does not lend him a hand. Willem Dafoe has definately made better performances than this.  The second best acting job in the movie probably belongs to Reese Witherspoon, but she does not appear often enough to make her performance have a profound effect on the movie.  The largest problem in the movie is probably the direction. With almost no change at all, the movie changes from in intriguing mental piece to collage of gruesome deaths and axe murderings.  Had the second half of the movie spent more time examining the psyche of the characters and less time dismembering them, this movie would have been better.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie certainly is not bad and can be quite enjoyable for many viewers.<br/><br/>Rating: C+"
"capkronos","7","1","2","7 May 2003"," Toned down from the novel, but the satire is still intact.
","Bret Easton Ellis' novel was thought to be unfilmable, but it's great someone tried, and pulled no punches about it. Sure, some of the more sick and tasteless scenes were omitted, but the tone and biting satire of the piece remains, and that is what's important.<br/><br/>Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a 1980s Wall Street tycoon in NYC who has it all...and he KNOWS it--good looks, a nice body, loads of money, a penthouse apartment and a rich bitch fiancée (Reese Witherspoon). He's also a psycho suffering from the shallowness, prejudice and personal anonymity in his upscale lifestyle who can't control his homicidal tendencies.<br/><br/>This film is initially an assault on yuppiedom and 1980s conservatism (with perfect music score by John Cale and appropriately sunny pop tunes), and although this doesn't necessarily have enough satiric stabs for a feature length movie, it's compulsively watchable nonetheless. In a world of platinum cards, Valentino suits, decadent nightclubs, A-list restaurants and exaggeratedly vapid characters, it's pretty outrageous seeing Bale (who's terrific) stab a bum (""Get a goddamn job!""), axe a coworker, aim a nail gun at the back of his meek secretaries head and, covered in blood, chasing a hooker down a hallway with a chainsaw. He also quotes Ed Gein, watches Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (and porn tapes), and listens to Ronald Reagan lie on national TV about Iran Contra.<br/><br/>Like Harron's I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, the movie, no matter how out-there it gets, is grounded by the extremely passionate, uncompromising beliefs of the protagonist. Harron co-scripted with Guinevere Turner (who also appears as a victim). On a side note, the amusing raincoat/murder scene may have actually been borrowed from the film Hollywood CHAINSAW HOOKERS!"

I couldn't wait to see this when it first came out, but I left the theater being very disappointed. The crew on this picture, didn't do a thing to maintain the brutality the book contained, and Christian Bale tried way to much to be that psychopathic killer, but he just didn't do it right...

"flying-monkeys","7","1","2","8 September 2002"," Still Undecided...
","It's been about a year since I watched this film and I still don't know what to think of it. When I picked it out at the video store, I did so strictly because it was depicted as a horror/suspense film (which I love) and it had Christian Bale in it (who I liked as an actor even though the only movie I'd seen him in was Little Women). Maybe it was the fact that I was going into this movie with visions of Laurie (Bale's character in Little Women) still in my head or that I had absolutely no idea what the plot was but I was stunned to say the least.<br/><br/>My family and I (all adults) sat down to watch MY big selection (which they all made sure to point out after we were done watching, and actually only my sister and myself made it all the way through it the parents evacuated not long after the first gory scene), and needless to say we were all shocked at what we were watching. My mouth literally dropped open and stayed that way until the end. I didn't know how to feel after I viewed all the cold-blooded gruesome murder scenes followed by Bateman's even colder reactions to them. Yes, the humorous actions like talking about music choice was quite funny but I was bracing myself for whatever was to come next, after all I really had no idea. It was a very realistic performance from Bale, which has now forever changed my visual image of him as an actor. I had no idea he had such range, such talent. I will forever be a fan. He really was Bateman, I got chills just watching this character, listening to him speak. But I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. They were all so materialistic and selfish it was hard to feel empathy for them.<br/><br/>Perhaps, one day I will brave viewing it again so I can really gauge the overall movie but for now I'm content with knowing I've seen it. The main thing I remember when I think about ""American Psycho"" is man, Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman was one scary SOB. Maybe I'll read the book first then watch the movie. This film definitely takes you outside the typical movie goer comfort zone so be prepared for anything. I would rate Christian Bale's performance a 10/10 but for the movie (until I can see it again) I would give it a 5/10."
"Silverzero","10","1","2","30 August 2002"," Clever, witty sub-slasher which explores the perils of obsession, fantasy and reality.
","American Psycho is an excellent adaption of an excellent book. It really couldn't be better. It doesn't try to be a comedy but some of the scenes manage to be very funny. (The Paul Allen murder scene is a riot.)<br/><br/>Christian Bale's portrayal of a self-obsessed, jealous, competitive man, Patrick Bateman, is excellent and Oscar worthy. Willem Dafoe could have been used more but does well for his small part and it's a change to see him playing a good guy. It's good to see Jared Leto break away from teen-movies onto more serious roles and is terrific as the intelligent, but stupid Paul Allen. Chloe Sevigny gives a very humane performance as Bateman's secretary, Jean. Reese Witherspoon is disappointing as the bitchy character (which she always plays) Evelyn. That concludes the acting.<br/><br/>The most unexpected thing about the film is the way it toned down on the books violence and capitalised on the books humour. Many of the lines that the characters deliver are effortlessly amusing. Bateman seems to always say, `I have to return some video-tapes' to get out of a sticky situation. `We saw a musical. O Africa Brave Africa It was a riot'. `I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but my fiancée Evelyn keeps buzzing in my ear'. The way it pokes fun at wealthy snobs (Stash, even though he was a mute, was hilarious). I liked the way Bateman waffled on about Huey Lewis and The News before decapitating someone. Or Whitney Houston while 2 lesbians make out like there's no tomorrow. Watch out for the scene with the business cards.<br/><br/>The film has a very confusing ending, which isn't exactly justified. Overall this is the most intelligent serial killer movie I've seen in a long time. 8.1 out of 10."

","American Psycho is one of the best films I've seen in recent years; it is always refreshing to see a film with something to say.  By the way, I've never read the book.<br/><br/>American Psycho is not a film for the faint-hearted.  One could argue that at times the violence appears to be of the tongue-in-cheek, over the top style of Evil Dead, for instance, but I think that is to miss the point. Clearly here the intention is to provoke a reaction, and to ask the question ""why?"", not to provide convincing real-life scenarios.<br/><br/>Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman excels: you could feel Bateman's tension reach out from the screen.  I found that near the end I was feeling more sympathy for Bateman than for anyone as he alone had shown emotional reactions to his environment.<br/><br/>I particularly like the fact that the film felt like a complete work; the themes in it were explored.  Technically I found the film to be superb: photography, lighting and sets were stark and appropriate to the story; Bateman's choice in music was simply hilarious.<br/><br/>Note to some other reviewers: this film is not a whodunnit!  If you've ever thought about a film you saw for more than five minutes then go and watch it: you won't be disappointed."

"yucel81x","9","1","2","17 June 2002"," A triumph or a travesty? Does it matter?
","After numerous attempts to watch this movie from beginning to end (not from lacking the stomach to stand the graphic nature of many of the scenes, but simply from countless interruptions), I've finally seen this film in its entirety. Having only read bits and pieces of the book (enough to understand that the book was far more lurid and explicit), I can't comment on just how well the film adapted the novel. However, I can comment on the film and its own merits...and it has many.<br/><br/>First of all, the direction and photography are wonderful. The atmosphere of the yuppie and materialist world of 1987 is captured beautifully through the sterile gaze of the New York high-rises and designer business suits. The soundtrack is a great melange of '80's pop songs and an engaging symphonic score. The acting is top-notch from all parties, especially the lead. Christian Bale delivers well as a man without soul or conscience while at the same time appealing to our sensibilities, imparting on our forgiveness, and feeding off our own morbid fantasies. And that is exactly what this movie is about.<br/><br/>Bale portrays Patrick Bateman, the ultimate example of young urban professional materialist culture. From the unemotional narration, to the blank expressions on his face (even when he smiles, we can see right through the facade and see the emptiness), everything about Bale's performance conveys the mental illness of Bateman. Chloe Sevigny is a treat as his secretary, the one person throughout the movie who actually touches the slightest glimmer of humanity he may possess.<br/><br/>Some people I know have panned this movie because of the confusing ending and the lack of real action. What these people fail to realize is that this film is not about a serial killer, nor is it the testimonial of a man confessing his sins. It is a story about a psychotic...the difference lies in that while a serial killer story would be simplistic, this is far more complex. By the end, we question whether or not Bateman actually killed anybody, how he could've been getting away with it, and even if any of the movie ever actually happened. All the tiny clues are there, from people not noticing bloodstains to someone thinking he said ""Mergers"" instead of ""Murders."" Is he really a killer? This should not be the question...rather the question should be if the man is crazy...the answer. Yes. In the sickest, most twisted possible way the story could end, we see just how insane Patrick Bateman is...and it is utterly eerie.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" is a movie that pushes the limits of the audience's ability to cope, for a number of reasons. A film told from the point of view of a psychotic is harsh enough, but the film also beckons the audience to question their own sanity. You're forced to look at your own sensibilities and morals and put them to the test...can you condone Bateman's actions and thoughts? Do you agree with them? Sometimes you find yourself saying yes to these questions, and for this some people may call it a travesty. By the same token, it pushes the envelope...thus it could even be called a triumph. Be warned...this is not a film for all tastes, but one thing is certain...it is one of a kind."

"thericky-2","Null","1","2","11 April 2000"," They almost hit the satire... but not quite.
","Let me start off by saying that American Psycho is not nearly the movie many reviews make it out to be.  I refer to both the good and bad ones.  It is by no means the best satire ever made, nor is it completely worthless. American Psycho is a near miss of a great movie.<br/><br/>The basis of this movie is not, as many would believe, the random killings of a psychotic man, like in recent teen-slasher films.  The basis is actually a satire aimed at the rich and famous's power in the world we live. Think O.J.  Such power is represented in this movie through the use of one psychotic businessman.  The commentary lies not within his actions, but rather within his ability to get away with them.<br/><br/>While I love a good satire of big business as much as the next guy (Fight Club did a fairly good job at this subject), it is in this respect that American Psycho tries hard, but seems to miss the mark.  While scenes involving dealings with business cards and discussions of fellow business employees are relatively amusing, the movie as a whole falters with its blatant use of cheesy killing scenes.  I had the opportunity of viewing this movie in the theatre on my college campus with many other college students. It was these scenes that turned the theatre from a horrified, yet curious crowd into one that was laughing as if they were watching [insert recent teen comedy hit here].<br/><br/>American Psycho had serious potential to be a well written, well acted dark comedy.  However, between the choice to use a Tom Cruise look-alike as the main character and the choice to play off the killing scenes as if they were straight out of Evil Dead, the movie could not survive.  Overall, I rate the movie my average score of a 7/10, as it was better than many movies nowadays, but no where near the quality it could have been."
"rlcsljo","6","1","2","17 April 2000"," Should have been made 15 years ago

But alas, rumor has it that certain vital scenes were cut to achieve an ""R"" rating and it shows.    The book made it clear that Batemen was a necrophiliac, but the movie makes it seem that he feels sexually inadequate because his business card is not up to snuff!  There may be some rebellious elements to the emptiness of his well to do world, and the Reagan go-go 80's.  If you prefer the latter explanation, this was not a bad film; if you prefer the former, this movie is almost a total waste of time."
"jaceydoe-2","Null","1","2","15 April 2000"," And the Oscar goes to...
","I have just seen this movie yesterday after a month of hot anticipation. Controversy is, after all, a thing I adore.  I must tell you that I was absolutely mesmerized by this wonderful film.  Everything about it was wonderfully done, right down to Christian Bale's cheezy smile and yuppy demeanor.  I went in kind of expecting a blood bath and came out nearly in tears from laughing so hard.  It was sheer enjoyment to watch all of the actors, especially Bale, run amok in the posh district of NYC in the midst of 80s excess.  I would like to extend a special thanks to the casting people of this movie, Christian Bale is at last going to get the credit he so badly deserves.  I thank my lucky stars that Leo what's- his-name didn't get this part.  Bale touches emotional points that Dicaprio will never be able to touch.  Bale is funny, scary and utterly sad as Patrick Bateman. His American accent is superbly done seeing that he is from Wales.  The Academy might as well hand the best actor statuette over to him as soon as possible. And yes, his performance is that great.  As for the script and directing, it is just as entertaining as watching Bale chop up a helpless co-worker with a shiny new ax as he listens to Huey Lewis and the News, which is very entertaining to be totally honest.  The satire of the 80s is perfectly done and the scene where Patrick and his co-workers show off business cards is bound to be a classic film scene for years to come. There is one thing that I do ask of you. DO NOT pay attention to the trailers for this movie.  It IS NOT a slasher film by any means what so ever.  Granted there is plenty of gore and sex in the film, it is all purely satirical and it is all there to get laughs out of the audience.  And one more thing, don't go into the theater expecting a big ending out of this film because you will be seriously disappointed.  The ending, although very good, leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  So you have to be a very open minded person to appreciate it.  Overall, I give American Psycho five stars and beyond..."

","Pros: Sets, Black humor, Cinematography.<br/><br/>Cons: Lack of characterization from minor characters, Gratuitous violence and sex, needs repeated viewings to get the humor.<br/><br/>American psycho is a satire for eighties greed based on the novel of the same name. Folks, Christian Bale probably gives one of the best performances of that year as the psychopathic banker Patrick Bateman. Most people hated this movie because they felt the main character was a jerk and was mean to women. But if dissected carefully, you begin to find out that patrick bateman is really just an end product to reaganism. For example, evidence is given in the movie that most of the violence is imagined in bateman's head and he really imagines himself committing crimes but cannot bring himself to actually do it. Also he is never shown working so one can be skeptical in his role in the office and whether he is really important. Plus, he always has his name mistakened for another coworker by another character and this leads to some funny situations. Marry harron does a good job of directing this anti-female novel and Guinevere Turner has to be given kudos for adapting a difficult movie. The real praise should be lavished on Christian bale as he personifies Patrick Bateman. Loaded with unintentional( or intentional) black humor, this is one of the funniest movies of the year. With such classic lines as ""I had to kill a lot of people"" and memorable scenes, American psycho never gets stale with repeated viewing. Some people have complained about the last thirty minutes but I think it is important to showing just how much of a psycho bateman really is. His friends, although make brief appearances are hilarious and some of the imagined murders do nothing but bring laughter to your face<br/><br/>Premise: Patrick Bateman is wanted in the connection of the death of Paul Allen, a coworker.<br/><br/>American Psycho received no Academy awards but got critical Kudos.<br/><br/>Grade: 10/10 (American masterpiece)"

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I've been reading other comments on American Psycho, and it seems as if there are a lot of people disagreeing about stuff. Well, I think that's just what the director wanted - to create a film that people would remember, discuss, debate, whether or not they liked it, and that's what we've all been doing! I don't think it was made for people to ""like"", more to give insight and provoke. But anyways, I really liked it. There's something really funny about a well to do guy saying lines like, ""I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane?"" right in front of peoples faces. Little do they know.... The plot is almost non-existent, and to be honest, I didn't really care about it. There's more to this movie than that, I just found it really interesting watching Patrick's life roll by and the wierd way he lives it. I guess you have to have a certain amount of intelligence and open-mindedness to get a film like this. I like to think that Bateman actaully did kill all those people...and the b**tard got away with it, just cause he did. Cause no one ever suspected him or whatever, it's a better ending than, ""it was all in his head."" The film is quite disturbing with the explicit sex scenes and violence (actually, although I am naturally squemish, I didn't think there wasn't as much gore as everyone made out to be), but it's sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. Like the part where Bateman's with the two prostitutes and he's going into detail about PHIL COLLINS of all people, and at the same time instructing the women into positions. Or when we see just the utter madness of him when he gets totally manic over a fellow collegue having a better business card. There's something appealing about Bateman, even though he's a pretentious prick who is obsessed with vanity, sex and murder.<br/><br/>Special praise for Christian Bale, he is not only one fine looking actor, but his mannerisms and facial expressions give Bateman that supressed madness look. 10/10 for a wicked film. Check out the scene where he's about to axe Paul Allen, his prancing about to the music is hilarious."

Although the journey is interesting, I think it deserves about a six out of ten: the dialogue was repetitive, and the point has already been made that consumerism is empty and lifeless in other movies, and in a better way. It also seemed a bit pretentious, as though it was trying to be deep and meaningful, when it was really just an interesting journey into the mind of a yuppie-psycho.<br/><br/>So in conclusion I didn't like it much but if you think you might become a fanatic follower watch it - it could be the best movie you've ever seen.

","Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" is a merry prankster nightmare. A cheerfully irreverent drawing room slasher movie about a natty young Wall Street serial killer, who for all his smug ruthlessness is also the film's anxious, cringing conscience. He's a macho monster who's all aquiever on the inside. Harron, has worked a kind of alchemy on Bret Easton Ellis' infamous 1991 novel, which turned homicide into the ultimate blatant metaphor for yuppie heartlessness. The book was a manufactured scandal - a show boat catalog of brand names and body parts, all engineered to call attention to Ellis' hate-chic ""audacity."" Harron eliminates most of the author's graphic, nearly surgical grisliness and the ugly currents of misogyny as well (the killer's delight in hacking up woman may have been the book's single deepest emotion.) She stages the blood splattered violence as stylized tongue in cheek spectacle, complete with chain saws and gleaming axes, that's as kicky and easy to watch as say the murders in the ""Scream"" films. Funny, pungent and weirdly gripping, ""American Psycho"" is a satire that feels like a hallucination. The film doesn't entirely work; it's confounding when it should be haunting. Yet Christian Bale as the psychotic keeps Patrick lurching blindly toward humanity, until we see a self being born in a man who, paradoxically was too selfish to have one."

","I've read the book, which was fantastic, so i, like most fans of the book, i expected the film to be an endless gore fest, focussing on the incredibly dark nature of Patrick Bateman. But, Mary Harron goes in a completely different way. Instead, she goes comedy, continually mocking the yuppies that plagued Wall Street. These people who have to fit in, where the people you're seen with and places you eat in are very very important. And the truth is, it works unbelievably well. Pat Bateman is the butt of the jokes, a man so scared of not fitting in, that his sanity is slipping fast. Killing for fun is his hobby. Throughout the comedy, there are plenty of dark moments to keep the hardcore fans happy, yet even they are done with a giggle. The film though would not be so good if it wasn't for Mary Harron. The Direction is first class, never rushing to tell the story, the camera work is marvellous, knowing when to move and when to keep still, it works perfectly, building an unparralelled atmosphere. But i have been saving the best till last. Two words, Christian Bale. He injects so much into this character, making him so very chilling and ridiculously funny with just the slightest of facial movements. His eyes say everything and that is a talent to behold. It's his dead pan deliveries ""i know my behavior can be a little...erratic sometimes"" that make you fear him like death, and somehow make you burst out giggling too. The scenes between the detective and Patrick create sparks too, the way he goes from a cold, emotionless being to a dribbling sweating and nervous moron is superb. Very Good marks all round, it leaves a few questions in the end but it's worth all the confusion in the world. An underrated masterpiece."

","This has been a favourite of mine for a while.  Ever since reading the book in 1999, I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this picture and I must say I was in no way disappointed.  There were many names thrown around for the role of Patrick Bateman; and I must say if Leonardo DiCaprio had have got the part as originally intended, I may have had to boycott the film!  Don't get me wrong, as pretty boy Romeo, or a similar role in Titanic as Jack, that is fine.  But this role required a strong performance, and that is what it got perfectly in Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Bale plays Bateman perfectly.  In fact, better than that, he is Patrick Bateman.  His dry wit, intelligence and also his psychotic side shine through brilliantly.  The supporting cast is equally impressive.  Chloe Sevigny as his lovestruck secretary is fantastic, and William Dafoe as the snooping cop is actually quite unnerving.<br/><br/>However, aside from Bale's performance, it is the direction which really carries this movie.  Mary Harron has gone for the approach of 'less is more', merely suggesting gruesome acts of violence as opposed to showing them.<br/><br/>What causes some confusion with this film is the ending.  I must say that it is open to individual interpretation, but I have my own theory.  Bateman actually did carry out the murders, but this , like anything, was hidden behind a good reputation and money.  The estate agent at the end tells him just to leave because they have disposed of the bodies, as if the true story had been made public, then the value of the property would have plummeted. Hell, he had been confused as Halberstram a few times, so his attorney had mistaken someone for Paul Owen, when he said he had lunch with him.<br/><br/>But that is just my theory, and it is one of the things that makes this movie so great, the chance to draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>
I recommend this movie to anyone interested in an intelligent, absorbing story which is made believable and all the more terrifying by terrific performances and faultless direction.<br/><br/>9.5/10 (no movie is perfect!)"

","One of my brothers workmates lent the dvd release of American Psycho to my brother shortly before Christmas. On handing him the movie, the friend simply said these four words.... ""See What You Think."" To this day, i still think that would have made an equally as good a tag line to the movie as the one one chosen by the producers.<br/><br/>Two days before Christmas, and having already seen the movie by then himself, my brother carted my dvd player down from the bedroom for us both to watch. Before sliding in the disc, he said... ""See What You Think.""<br/><br/>
All I knew about American Psycho before watching it was that bizarre front cover and, of course, it starred one of my favorite actresses, Reese Witherspoon. I am ashamed to say I had never heard of Christian Bale!!<br/><br/>I was treated to one of the most off the wall, dark, absorbing, and extremley funny films I have EVER seen!<br/><br/>A send up of the 80's 'yuppie' scene, Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a wall street exec' who's nightly bloodlust transforms him into an ultra cool, yet scarilly crazed, serial killer.<br/><br/>It's very difficult to describe this film and surmise wether or not someone will love it or hate it, thus i think the best thing you can say to someone is what i am going to say to everybody here who is yet to have the pleasure....

","Guys, you have to see this movie! Well, actually you'd better read the book first. You'll be shocked by the book. I'm not that delicate, and i'm used to fearful violent readings, but i admit i had to shut the book close, at times, cause i couldn't bear imagining the situations described in it.<br/><br/>The movie's softer. It explores the black-comedy side the book already had, conceiling and leaving to your imagination the massacres, the tortures, the killing. The movie won't show you Patrick murdering a kid at the zoo; it won't show you what Patrick does to his victims' eyes.<br/><br/>But it succeeds anyway in making you understand. In taking you to the place Bret Easton Ellis wanted to take you to: the misery and the social violence of the eighties will be in front of you. The emptiness, the shallowness and the stupidity of those years will be in front of your eyes, and you will get to understand how a young man could reach the point of imagining to perpetuate such indescribable crimes, of wishing it. He will imagine so, he will wish so just tell himself he's alive. Killing, murdering, torturing, raping...all those actions (beware, he only imagines them...) represent a form of rebellion against a superficial society, where business cards are status symbol, and where you'd better have a very elegant one in your pocket if you don't want to be rejected by society. Where persons don't have a name, don't have an identity...cause they all look the same... on that background, killing is living, torturing is shouting out at the world ""look, i have a personality, i'm not just another one of those guys you see out there"", raping is surviving.<br/><br/>The movie shows all that, with a lighter touch than the book but with almost the same effectiveness. Cold lights, perfect settings, good writing. And one last, important ingredient: a huge Christian Bale...his performance is stunning. He is Patrick Bateman, he is all of us."

","I saw this movie when it first came out, and there were over twenty people in the theater, including me and my friend.  By the time it was over, it had fallen to six, but we both thought that the film was, as a whole, a masterpiece.  Yesterday, I rented it for the first time (since no one else will ever check it out) and watched it with another of my friends.  Once again, totally blown away.<br/><br/>This IS indeed among the most underrated films to come out.  It's got an amazing cast, amazing acting by the cast, and beautiful locations.  On the other hand, it's one of the most gratuitous movies I've ever seen.  Doesn't bother me in any way, but it's very easy to see why the Oscar committee might run and hide.  One look at the threesome sex scene, and they were hiding under their seats.<br/><br/>The true beauty of this film comes out in the acting of Christian Bale, a virtual unknown.  True, he had held a bit part in ""Pocahontas"" and the role of that kid Jack in ""Newsies"", but I doubt he'd want us to talk about that. The role of the psychotic, yet well organized Patrick Bateman came almost immediately after him being in a role as far to the other side of the spectrum as possible...Jesus.  His incredible breadth is shown throughout such tense scenes as the business card showdown, the hilarious phone message (""I just had to kill a lot of people!""), and the disturbingly funny murder of Paul Allen, done to a personal review of Huey Lewis and the News.<br/><br/>The one problem, the very ending.  This second time, I figured out what was really going on, but it took me a damn long time.  I'll probably end up watching it again today...just to make sure I was completely right.  Still, I can stand up and say ""I completely understand the ending to American Psycho!"", and people will respond ""What are you talking about?"""

","Patrick Bateman is no ordinary man.<br/><br/>This becomes readily apparent through the voice-over description that Bateman gives the audience as he begins his early morning routine of hygiene and calisthenics. However, the particularly poignant line of this exposition is, ""There is no real sense of Patrick Bateman at all.""<br/><br/>While critics have said that the film is not nearly as violent as the novel (and this may be true, seeing as this reviewer has not yet read Ellis' book), there's violence, gore, and sexual depravity aplenty in American Psycho.<br/><br/>As the film continues, Bateman's world begins to blur. The line, ""I believe that my mask of sanity is beginning to slip,"" speaks volumes about what will occur during the next hour and a half or so.<br/><br/>Bateman's very existence seems to be one of complete madness, a true psychotic outlook. Also, while talking to friends, or other people, Bateman will spew out the most vile epithets of death and serial murder, all to the surprising complacency of the yuppies that should be mortified by such statements. While having drinks with a business rival, Bateman nonchalantly says, ""I enjoy dissecting girls. I'm utterly insane, you know."" This elicits no response.<br/><br/>The closest film I can relate this to is last year's The Talented Mr. Ripley. However, what Matt Damon's Oscar snub lacked is what this film had in spades: Humor.<br/><br/>American Psycho is chock full of the darkest comedy around. When asked what he does, Bateman answers, ""I'm into murders and executions mostly"" (a pun derived from his true profession, ""mergers and acquisitions"").<br/><br/>I personally don't care if the Oscars are about a year off. Christian Bale is delightfully wicked in this piece, and unless another actor can convince me otherwise in the next eleven months, my vote is for this young actor to walk away with the golden statue in 2001.<br/><br/>For those of you who can analyze the finer points of storytelling, you're in for a real treat. Near the end of the film it becomes difficult to ascertain just what is real and what is imagined, what is atrocity and what is fantasy, what is Patrick Bateman and what is not.<br/><br/>See this film, and leave your own perceptions of reality at the door."
"RobMontu","Null","1","2","26 August 2001"," One of the greatest dark comedies/ satires ever.
","*WARING*: Please note this review includes *Spoilers*<br/><br/>How many times have you said to yourself, ""I could just kill that guy girl]"" when someone ticks you off or ""I'd kill to get that_____"" when your jealous of someone else or want something really bad? About a few million times, or even more, is the answer your going to give or your lying. Patrick Bateman says these things to himself all the time, he just takes it to it's literal extreme- actually doing it...<br/><br/>This is the basis of the book and the movie 'American Psycho'- the later which I am reviewing. It's a dog eat dog world, and he [Patrick Bateman} is the top dog, or he'll do something about it... kill everyone higher than him.<br/><br/>The plot is non-existent. It's about a yuppie in 1987 named Patrick Bateman, he has to be the best, or be nothing... if you tick him off, make him jealous, or turn him on, blood is going to fly. He gets mad just because someone has a better business card than he does; he kills a homeless man because a bum and him have nothing in common except being human - even after he [the bum] praises Patrick.<br/><br/>His motto is 'Death comes to those who are worse than me or greater, at the hands axe or knife or chainsaw] of myself'<br/><br/>I think one of the main reasons I love this movie is that for years my worst enemy have been yuppies, and the other being the fact I myself am a 'Patrick Bateman' as everyone else is, were all perfectionists on some level or we all want to get ahead and be the best, as I pointed out earlier.<br/><br/>This would make a great horror film, but instead it makes an even better comedy. Anyone who would call this a horror-film would call 'Dr. Strangelove or how I learned to stop hating and love the bomb' a paranoid, war, thriller- aka: they're insane!<br/><br/>American Psycho is a satire of the 'Yuppies', you know those movies from the eighties about eighties yuppies and this is the same thing, one funnier, better, and oh yeah and our hero is a murderer.<br/><br/>The performances are sheer brilliance, I cannot say enough about how well they all do. They are like the godfather, nobody could play these characters- ever except the ones chosen, whereas most movies if you know other choices you can picture them in these roles, but not here.<br/><br/>Also the set design is amazing too, each room looks better than the last, it makes us envy it's characters, and that's nearly impossible in a ""Horror Film"" or ""Comedy""- as in horror your either a killer or your being killed and in a comedy you know that people are always laughing at you, unless you make a bad joke.<br/><br/>However, the most brilliant thing to note is the direction. In my mind their have been three truly master shot makers ever, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese, but now I can add Mary Harron to my list, making it four. In addition, I have yet to see a better performance from any of the stars, before or after this film, and I thank the director. Also the fact that you can't see one piece of flesh being pierced in the whole film, and the only time I want to puke is when I see dead bodies or the heads in the fridge- but was too clinged to the screen to care and actually go through with it.<br/><br/>Also of note is their original choice of director Ridley Scott, he would be horrible for this material, you would not only see flesh being pierced but see it fly! Splattering everywhere, just raw human flesh- makes you want to puke doesn't it, well that's my point.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest dark comedies ever, and only becomes thrilling during the end when Patrick's 'Mask of Sanity' slips and only has one truly frightening scene in which he gets all 'leather face' on a whore by following her around his house with a giant chainsaw, and eventually drops it down a spiral staircase she's at the bottom of and makes a very definite, splat sound, as her body is lying dead on the floor. But for most of the movie is just a comedy (an extremely dark comedy) and one of the best, up there with the aforementioned Dr. Strangelove."

","First, I saw ""American Psycho"" at the cinema. I found the film weird but brilliant, because I liked the way the US society was criticized.<br/><br/>
Then, I took the novel ""American Psycho"" of Bret Easton Ellis and I read it in a few days, because I couldn't get away from that book. I really enjoyed reading the novel, so I decided to rent the film and watch it again, in order to compare between the movie and the book, looking for parts of the novel not included in the film. <br/><br/>My big surprise when I realized that most of the dialogues in the movie were exactly the same words in the book (this explains that ""deja vu"" sensation I had reading the book ^_^). And that's a thing that doesn't normally happen. Just read Michael Crichton's ""Lost World"" and compare it with the film... You'll see what I mean...<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" shows to the audience the emptiness of the society, the wisdom's mask that everybody wear to hide our darkest side. But for Patrick Bateman, a 27 year-old handsome guy, it's getting really tough to keep that mask on... But Patrick Bateman is not a poor worker, or a homeless: he works at Wall Street and earns $200.000 a year. In a world of expensive restaurants, night parties, cocaine, top models and lots of money, Bateman realizes how empty his life is.<br/><br/>The film is truely an exercise of style, a mixture of comedy, thriller and terror. Christian Bale is outstanding as Patrick Bateman, he steals all the interpretation in the film. Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto are also there, but they don't shine like Bale.<br/><br/>All the Bateman's monologues are incredible, literally taken from the Bret Easton Ellis' book. And the soundtrack is brilliant too. If you like 80's-early 90's music, prepare to listen to Phil Collins, Huey Lewis and the News, Withney Houston and many more!<br/><br/>Just an advice: read the book, then watch the money, you will enjoy it much more! 9 out of 10"

","What a brilliant film! I read the book and had serious questions over whether it could be pulled off on the big screen, but it sure was. The key to this movie was the casting of Patrick Bateman. I had heard that the role was first offered to Leonardo DiCaprio. Thank God, he turned it down! Christain Bale is just superb in the role.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a trader working Wall Street during the mid 1980's. He is your typical ""yuppie"" of the 1980's, totally consumed with himself and style. However, this yuppie is also on the fringes of insanity. How insane he is, you don't know, because he is the narrator. In fact, one of the great things about this film, is that you don't know what is real or what is playing out in the imagination of Patrick Bateman.<br/><br/>Many films have tried to capture the essence of the 1980's, few have done it. This movie achieves that and then some. It show what a truly pretensious, greedy and hollow decade it was. It was the decade of Reagan. People are so wrapped up in themselves, that they fail to see the danger that surrounds them and in fact might kill them. Great filmmaking, **** out of ****."

","Every so often there is a film which is denied critical acclaim, simply because people keep comparing it to some superior flick. Take ExistenZ compared to The Matrix, for example. The Thing compared to Alien. Or The Game compared to Se7en. It's no accident I'm mentioning David Fincher's movies because I'm tempted to make one of those comparisons, this time with American Psycho and Fincher's Fight Club. And indeed, it's hard to gloss over the similarities, especially when you like Fight Club as much as I do. Both films parody consumerism, materialism and yuppies. Both films feature characters who engage in violent acts (although the reasons for this behaviour are far clearer in Fight Club). Also, the structure of both films share elements (third acts veering off in an alternate direction, etc.) and certain scenes in American Psycho recall distinct scenes in Fight Club (and A Clockwork Orange, for that matter).<br/><br/>Compare both films and American Psycho loses out. There are numerous reasons. Most notably, American Psycho is relatively plot-free. We simply get a series of scenes of satire and ultraviolence, and some very, very basic storylines involving a murder investigation and Patrick Bateman's further descent into insanity. In Fight Club, the plot was one of its strongest points. Furthermore, American Psycho is a very cold film. It's main character is unlikable to the extreme so the coldness is actually a good idea in one way, but of course, it doesn't make for an emotionally absorbing experience (you could argue that this is as cerebral as Kubrick's famous satire). Fight Club did have a likable main character. It's determined focus on Bateman also makes it impossible for other characters (the women in particular) to make a lasting impression. Who can forget Marla Singer, on the other hand? Finally, American Psycho is so definitely eighties, it is at least as much a satire of the era as it is of its themes. In Fight Club, the themes are extended into today, and, for me, that makes it a more relevant film.<br/><br/>But these points merely prove Fight Club is better, not that American Psycho is bad. Not at all, in fact. American Psycho wisely keeps it cool and detached and as a satire works tremendously well. There are a lot of stand-out scenes. The one that pops to mind right now is an incredibly funny sequence in which a couple of perfectly interchangable yuppies show off their new business cards. The scene then shows how Bateman becomes genuinely jealous of his fellow yuppies' better looking cards. These smart and very funny scenes bring across the absolute focus on one's own exterior. It also illustrates the perfect interchangability of its characters. In fact, mixing up people and not caring to know their names is part of the whole film's joke.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is fantastic as narcissistic, egocentric and murderous Patrick Bateman and seems to get every scene just right. Indeed, his performance is probably what makes this film work. He plays Bateman not like a real person but like some kind of empty shell (the scene is which he recites the world's greatest plights is a great example), and also makes him perfectly aware and uncaring of his inner vacuousness. He is also as scary as any other movie psycho has ever been. His motivations are kept in the relative dark and the viewer is left to find those. To me, his behaviour is just another extension of his total uncaring, his complete inability to appreciate anything beyond the physical.<br/><br/>The scariest thing about it? That everytime Bateman seems to be confronting his environment with his and its emptiness, he is met by unattentiveness or laughter. That's the point; Bateman's world is arguably as insane as he is. Now, just keep telling yourself, I am NOT a product of the eighties.<br/><br/>

","************ SPOILERS ******************** My mistake was that I've read the book before I saw the movie - big mistake. My image of Pat Bateman was a hyper violent nutcase in perfect disguise - controlling and manipulating his environment in his ""normal"" life and murdering and torturing at nighttime. But the insanity should be visible throughout - in every move he makes.<br/><br/>The movie and Christian Bale *tries* to make that image, but they just don't make it - Bale is not able to balance on the edge between insanity and normal - he does not convince me at all. And that is a major flaw since the entire movie is based upon this image.<br/><br/>I don't want to see the gore, the blood or the rat thing - it would have made me really sick (I almost vomitted when I read the book) - that is not what I'm lacking in this movie. I want Christian Bale to convince me as Pat Bateman - that's not easy I know - I guess only two or three actors could have pulled it off and Christian Bale is not among those. Sorry to say it but it really ruins the movie.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is strange but it really just follows the book. I believe it wants us to ask this question: ""was all this just a dream in Pat Batemans sick mind - that he in need for some action just invented the whole thing ... or has the society just accepted that these brutal murders are OK - a sort of apathy as seen in Se7en?"".<br/><br/>The book: 8 of 10, the movie: 4 of 10."

","Personally, I feel like I have so much to thank Leonardo DiCaprio for. Every true film fanatic should praise God that he passed up the opportunity to star in this movie, allowing Christian Bale to step in and steal every single moment of the film.<br/><br/>It's not all about Bale, but he is the reason that this film worked on so many different levels. DiCaprio wouldn't have got near the edginess, dementia and sheer anger that Bale coolly conveys.<br/><br/>On the whole though, this film is a crunching, no-holds barred satire that critically scrutinises the joys and horrors of the 80's. Being an 80's child, even I can level with the fact that my only memories of the era are soothing pop ballads and materialistic struggles that even overspilled into the playground! Having studied the 80's though, I recognise even more, the extreme detail that Harron pays to the isolated, drug-fuelled, uniformity of a generation that would rather have a clear credit card, than a clear conscience.<br/><br/>Violent? Yes. Disturbing? Yes. Gratuitous? Not at all. There's nothing you haven't seen before if you're a real movie fan. However, what there is plenty of, is overblown hype about how violent and 'twisted' the movie actually is. In years to come, people will realise that this movie was as misread as 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Taxi Driver' and hail it-just like the aforementioned movies- as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you're going to read the book, see the movie first. They're both superb, but the movie will make you think of Bale as Bateman, and that makes the book all the more exciting and easier to visualise. This is, in my opinion, a close third for the best screen adaptation ever. Just behind 'The Godfather' and 'Silence Of The Lambs' respectively.<br/><br/>What you have in this movie is a great ensemble cast (Witherspoon, Sevigny, Dafoe and Leto are all at their excellent best, and Theroux as Pryce is a real revelation), an unusual sense of coldness (every shot seems glazed over, icy) and one of the greatest 'madman' performances ever to be, well, performed. Up there with Hopkins, Mitchum, DeNiro etc. How Bale didn't get at least an Oscar Nom, I'll never know. Not to worry, he will someday."

Beyond this facade however lies an empty and senseless world... To give his life some new impulses and to escape from this hopeless situation Patrick Bateman starts killing people, but he doesn´t get the hoped-for relief...<br/><br/>Without transfering the excessive violence from the book Mary Harron´s film is less a thriller, it´s more a satire on a glamorous society where people loose more and more the relationship to normality and themselves. In the first place ""American Psycho"" is worth watching because of his great main actor Christian Bale and the subtle, ironic and cynical dialogues.

The humor in the movie, subtle at times, and usually witty, was memorable, as were the twisted, erotic, and honest thoughts of Bateman.

","AMERICAN PSYCHO (2000) ***1/2 Directed by Mary Harron. Starring: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, Cara Seymour, Samantha Mathis, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon.<br/><br/>While writing Christian Bale's name above, I almost confused myself and wrote Patrick Bateman, the name of his character in AMERICAN PSYCHO. This is the kind of reaction that Bale, once the boy in the tragic EMPIRE OF THE SUN, causes in the audience- he fits perfectly Patrick Bateman, the Wall Street yuppie who starts killing people at night for no apparent reason. A pity that Mary Harron's film, based on Breat Easton Ellis' polemic and successful book, was so overlooked and underrated. It became known for the wrong reason: a scene of menage-a-trois that had to be cut in order to avoid the NC-17 rating (BTW, the scene wasn't cut here in Brazil!!!!!!) and the extreme violence. Some people called AMERICAN PSYCHO a pointless satire, or a satire about nothing. They aren't totally wrong: it is about the ""sweet nothing"" of the '80s, the age of yuppies, who had much money and not much else.<br/><br/>Mary Harron prints a weird style into AMERICAN PSYCHO, a kind of cross between David Lynch, David Fincher and herself- what can be seen in I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, her very interesting film debut. I haven't read Breat Easton Ellis' book, but I guess Mary, as a director and a screenwriter, did a good job, avoiding the extreme violence, but showing it stylized. The characters have a great development and the situations keep our attention from start to finish. It's awesome when Patrick talks about music before killing his next victim, when he and his friends compare his cards and all his observations about that stupid age and how he tried to escape from that, even being part of it. His lines are sarcastic, ironic.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is not the usual main character of a film, so it would be difficult to play him. But Christian Bale perfectly shows how ambiguous and hard to understand Patrick is. We hate him and love him at the same time. I loved his performance! The supporting actors are also great, even in small roles. Willem Dafoe is detective Donald Kimball, who has some strange dialogues with Patrick. Chloe Sevigny is great as his secretary Jean, maybe the only innocent person in a nest of snakes. Cara Seymour is Christie, a melancholic prostitute who keeps going to his flat- I voted for her on the IMDb poll which asked: ""From the movies of 2000 I felt most sorry for..."". BTW, she is in my favorite scene, the weirdest of the whole film, right after the second menage-a-trois scene (the ""yuppie"" written on the wall, the bodies, so cool!), mixing very black humor and tension. Jared Leto is Paul Allen, the first victim we see being killed. Samantha Mathis is Courtney, Bateman's drug addict lover. And Reese Witherspoon is Evelyn Williams, Bateman's annoying fiancé- I wanted more of her.<br/><br/>On its last third, AMERICAN PSYCHO shows the truth beyond it, resulting in an ambiguous, thought-provoking finale, which stays with us for many days. It proves that AMERICAN PSYCHO is a delightful film to watch, but not in a good way. It's a wicked, sick, bitter, sarcastic, weird, brilliant satire, a triumph of black humor, with many memorable moments. It's an admirable, audacious portrait of the yuppie age, taking the love and the hate to that era to the last consequences. Expect surprises like in a sort of magic show. Love it or hate it, you won't leave the movies indifferent. And someday they wanted to put Leonardo DiCaprio as Patrick Bateman...<br/><br/>I saw the menage-a-trois scene in the movies, you didn't...!!!"

","**!CONTAINS SPOILERS!** To me, this was one of the best films of 2000.  The acting, casting, and the direction are all great.  Christian Bale was perfect for the role of Patrick Bateman, and I cannot imagine Leonardo Dicaprio(who was originally going to play the part) in this movie.  He would have ruined it. <br/><br/>  This movie is a hilarious satire of the 80s culture.  Nothing in the movie is that graphic.   There is some blood and violence, and while the sex is explicit, the scene with Bateman flexing his muscles while having sex with the two prostitutes is hilarious, as are all his speeches about commercial music of the time.  The business card scene also rates high on my list. <br/><br/>  Compared to the book, which is horrifying(but darkly funny as well) in its description of the murders, the movie is really rather tame. <br/><br/>  I would recommend this film to anyone who is tired of all the brainless teen slasher and comedy movies coming out today, and would like to see something different."
"jack_1981","10","1","2","23 February 2001"," Fantastic, engaging, brilliant, superb...
","Well, well, well is this a great movie or what? This movie is great in many aspects. The acting is great. Christian Bale gives the performance for which all his future work will be rated against. The script is funny, dark and gloomy whenever it feels like it. The look and feel of the movie is very 80's. For some the shots of skyscrapers reminded me of that old TV show 'LA Law'.<br/><br/>-From this point on there are things that can be classed as spoilers. Ranging from small ones to heavy ones -<br/><br/>
Some people may not like this movie for 2 reasons. The lack of plot and graphic violence and sex scenes. but the thing is the violence is hardly graphic (I think the most gruesome we get is when the serial killer swings an axe at someone and blood gets splattered on him and the floor). And the sex scenes... well they are graphic, but they are actually funny. Same with the murders. They all have this hilarious undertone that [to me] had me laughing through the entire 100 or so minutes.<br/><br/>We start the movie off with black credits on the left of screen while on the right a red liquid drips down. We think it is blood since the movie is about a serial killer, but later on we find out it is actually a red berry sauce being served over a nice little meal at an expensive restaurant. Inside that restaurant we meet high power, 80's yuppie Patrick Bateman (the delectable Christian Bale). The movies anti-hero. Him and his fellow workmates talk about why they aren't getting served. Their thinking... because Patrick wont give the waiter oral sex. Later on we meet his fiance Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) as well as her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis), whom Patrick is having an affair with. Aswell as Courtney's fiance and patrick's workmate, who happens to be a closeted homosexual. We also meet another fellow worker on wallstreet Paul (Jared Leto).<br/><br/>In a hilarious running joke through the film everybody thinks Patrick Bateman is really someone else who they talk about Patrick Bateman with. Saying he's stupid, annoying and down-right pathetic. The humour in American Psycho is very black. Infact it's probably safe to say that the humour is so black, it's impossible to ever gain colour again. BLACK! What do I mean by really black? For some reason I found myself in hysterics with a scene in which Patrick chases a prostitute around his apartment wearing nothing. Absolutely nothing... but unfortunately good ol' Mr. Bateman has a chainsaw covering his ""area"" and we don't see anything. Later on in the scene we have the girl running down the apartment stairwell and at reaching the bottom Patrick drops a chainsaw on her. Funny? Hell yes. Scary? no, not really.<br/><br/>This movie isn't really scary. Scary as in Scream, Halloween etc because it is not a horror movie. it is a black comedy/80's satire.<br/><br/>All the performances in AP are good. But the movie does belong to Christian Bale who is looking very buff and sexy in the many scenes in which his he is shirtless or fully naked. Be warned straight men, there are a lot of shots of Christian's body while in a shower though we don't see anything too raunchy. Just a little backside.<br/><br/>Chloe Sivigny does very good as a the doe-eyed assistant to Patrick. Who does the best silent job ever. In the final scenes where she looks at patrick's work organiser and sees pictures of dead people that Patrick has drawn she just stares and is shocked. Even though she doesn't say anything it is very powerful. Willem Defoe is always cool. Here he plays a cop investigating Jared Leto's disappearance. Even the movie's co-writer/adapter has a role and a friend of Patrick.<br/><br/>Over all this movie was great. Very well made but not for everybody. Mary Harron and co have done a very good job adapting the very nasty book (which I have not read). They should've at least been nominated for an oscar. And Christian Bale was robbed of an oscar this year. He simply deserves it... more so than Tom Hanks or Russell -tough guy- Crowe, who showed a lot more talent in The Insider.<br/><br/>Anyway I loved this movie and hope you do too.<br/><br/>And... with the much talked about ending. Try figuring it within a day... or week. I'm still scratching my head as too whether *all* the murders were real or imagined... blah blah blah I'm talking too long.<br/><br/>10/10 or A+"
"GMeanie","10","1","2","8 February 2001"," A brilliant dark satire
","After reading so many bad reviews from people who obviously didn't get this film at all, I feel I have to set the record straight. American Psycho is a satire. A very dark and horrific satire, but still a satire.<br/><br/>American Psycho, the book, is the most mind-blowing piece of fiction I have ever read. It is a very cleverly written book, yet the violence depicted is so explicit that I found it hard to continue reading in parts. The film is only for those with thick skin, but compared to the book, its Disney.<br/><br/>Those who criticize the film for not being as violent as the book obviously fail to realize that if it was, it would have been banned in every country on the planet. While the majority of violence happens off-screen, I don't feel that this is in any way a disgrace to the book.<br/><br/>The best part of American Psycho is not the violence (which serves mainly as a distraction), but the narrative from Bateman, and the opportunity to go inside his head as see what pushes him over the edge. Patrick Bateman is a very wealthy, handsome, young, intelligent Wall St yuppie in the late 80's, who seemingly has everything. So the question put to the viewer is: What would turn a man like Bateman into such an angry, evil, sadistic psychopath? The answer is: The society and people around him.<br/><br/>Bateman's world, and that of his friend's, who all share similar lifestyles to him, is one that is dominated by image, one-upsmanship, and, most importantly, rampant materialism. From the examining of business cards, to demanding of having reservations at top restaurants even when not hungry, to Bateman's flawless knowledge of fine business suits, it is the never ending excessive materialism of the New York yuppie which drives Bateman insane. As Christian Bale quoted of his character ""with Bateman the clothes really do make the man"".<br/><br/>While Bateman comes off as a completely ruthless man who is a master of everything in his environment, in reality its completely different. The materialism which consumes Bateman and his friends, also leaves them nameless. Often, Bateman is mistaken for someone else by a colleague of his. It is only Bateman's bloodlust which makes him feel like an individual.<br/><br/>For those who have never read the book, and watch this movie for the first time the twist at the end (the most redeeming twist ever) may seem ridiculous. However, this is a film that when watched for a 2nd time will make complete sense. There are so many subtle hints throughout this movie (such as in the opening titles when what appears to be dripping blood in fact turns out the be decorative sauce on one of Bateman's ultra expensive power lunches) that will seem so obvious the 2nd time, but were understandably ignored the 1st time around when confronted by Bateman's violence. Remember, this entire film is narrated though the eyes of Bateman, so things are not always as they seem.<br/><br/>All in all this was an amazing film. The acting was flawless. Christian Bale absolutely stole this show. To get inside Bateman's head and do it this convincingly was quite a feat .The imagery was deceptive and clever, and the musical score fitted the film perfectly.<br/><br/>10/10 - the best film of 2000<br/><br/>
p.s. does anyone else find it extremely difficult to even imagine Leonardo DiCaprio playing Patrick Bateman? No way could he have pulled this off."

","wazup... i´ve been reading the book american psycho and was very happy when I first heard that it would be a movie based on the boojm and that Christan Bale was casted as Pat Bateman. Then I heard that Leonardo Dicaprio was casted and I almost fainted. He was not man enough to play a serial-killer with his baby-face. Then (thank god), Bale was again casted and the movie came out. First of all, I can only see 2 people do that part. 1. Christian Bale and 2. Christian Slater. They are both cool and can perform well in a part like that but I think that Christian Bale was perfect. My favourite scene was definitely when he played ""hip to be square"" and killed Paul Allen with an axe in the livingroom and then smokes a cigarette with blood in his face. The movie is very hard to explain since it is a story of a very strange man :-) But I think that the movie was even better than the book, which I thought wasn´t possible.

I yawned.<br/><br/>We were supposed to believe that the characters were high-powered Wall Street types, yet we never saw a single instance of them doing the work that earned them their astronomical salaries. All they did was make reservations and compare business cards.<br/><br/>The lead actor hammed up his part so much that his character lost all believability. Cloe Sevigny, a genuinely talented actor, was wasted. Poor Willem Dafoe. He aimlessly walked and talked through the middle of this mess, then disappeared.<br/><br/>Most good movies have a beginning, a middle and an end. American Psycho, however, was a plotless amalgam of unfunny restaurant scenes, boring sex and comic-book-type violence. No story was told, no characters were developed.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes insulted the viewer's intelligence. How can a killer drag a blood-leaking body across the floor of an apartment-building lobby and never be discovered? How can he chase a screaming woman through the halls and down the stairs of another apartment building, in the middle of New York City, and never draw attention?<br/><br/>How could anyone compare American Psycho with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

Also, you will not hear a more creative screenplay in a film this year  especially in the scenes when Bale's character is describing his version of 80's musicians societal insights as he is nonchalantly murdering and seducing his preys.

"Buddy-51","Null","1","2","28 October 2000"," sharp satire of yuppies
","No doubt about it, Mary Harrion's `American Psycho' is definitely not for every taste and audience demographic.  The good news is, perhaps, that the film is nowhere near as gruesome and gory as both its subject matter and its controversial nature would lead one to believe.  In fact, its tone of ironic comic detachment helps to de-emphasize the more sordid aspects of the material and to instead highlight the film's bitingly satiric message. <br/><br/>
Set in the mid-1980's, `American Psycho' casts a scathing eye on the then-brand new, up-and-coming group of 20-something executives known as `yuppies.'  Patrick Bateman, the psycho of the title, is a man who literally seems to have everything  stunning good looks, a fantastic physique, a beautiful fiancé, a diploma from Harvard and a successful career as a Wall Street executive.  Yet, alone of the young men with whom he consorts, Patrick flatly admits to us in voice-over narration that he is literally an empty-suit - that his perfectly maintained outer appearance, seemingly well-ordered social routine and empty, superficial personal relationships merely mask the moral emptiness that lurks at the core of his soul.  Much of the complexity of Patrick's character comes from the fact that he seems, paradoxically, to be both obsessed with the idea of conforming to the values of the world he lives in, and, at the same time, being strangely conscious of their unreality and meaninglessness.  Thus, we see him becoming almost emotionally unglued because he fears he will not be able to reserve the proper table at a posh upscale restaurant or because he feels that one of his corporate buddies has a more impressive looking business card than he does.  Much of Patrick's madness has its roots in the kind of obsessive-compulsive paranoia that arises from the modern insistence that life should and, indeed, can be converted into a perfect, problem-free existence if one just has enough money and a sufficient amount of the right `stuff' to make it that way.  Frankly admitting that he feels no emotional attachment to any other human beings, Patrick is thereby free to channel his madness into its ultimate anti-social, taboo-shattering shape and form: serial killing.  Thus, as days turn to nights, Patrick begins to rack up his victims and potential victims  a homeless man, assorted prostitutes, an ex-girlfriend, an unctuous business associate, even some policemen who get wise to his activities later in the film.  <br/><br/>Luckily for the squeamish among us, far more of the film's running time is devoted to a comic rather than thriller mode.  The brittle, dryly humorous Mary Harrion/Guinevere Turner screenplay mines the corporate world milieu and the twisted rantings of a values-free mind for all their black comedy potential.  Christian Bale brings a remarkable subtlety to a touchy role, managing to seem coolly alluring, chillingly detached, touchingly pathetic and wryly amusing all at the same time.   Special credit should go to the stark, almost antiseptic look the filmmakers achieve through the art direction and set design, a look that matches in visual terms the moral and emotional emptiness of the characters and their world. <br/><br/>
Much was made of the anti-woman tone of the novel at the time of its initial release. Perhaps because the writers and the director are themselves women, the movie seems to have toned down that aspect quite a bit.  Indeed, as in a movie like `In the Company of Men,' we find ourselves not so much appalled as sadly bemused by the vehemently anti-women comments uttered by Patrick and his cronies because we see what shallow losers these men really are. Harrion and Turner obviously know whereof they speak.<br/><br/>To reiterate, `American Psycho' may not be everyone's cup of cinematic tea, but those looking for a sharp little satire of modern American life will find some definite rewards."

"Shiva-11","Null","1","2","16 April 2000"," Doesn't cut it as serial killer thriller or witty satire
","American Psycho: In the heady eighties appearances were everything: consumerism was king, money was god and the towers of Wallstreet represented financial Sodom and Gomorrah.  Enter Patrick Bateman, investment banker extraordinaire: although he's similar to his colleagues - greedy, shallower than a puddle after an April shower, and a walking Calvin Klein ad - the only thing he likes better than dissecting pop songs is dissecting people.  As he explains it to one of his victims,  ""I'm in murders and executions"".  Stable he is not. I find it ironic, and yet somewhat appropriate, that a movie about a serial killer set during Wallstreet's glory days is getting wide release when the markets are undergoing one of the worst bloodbaths in years. I haven't read Ellis' novel, but I remember vividly the outrage that followed its release - indeed, they tried to confiscate it at the border as obscene material.  Critics accused Ellis of reveling in blood and gore and creating a how-to book for serial killers. This movie is not that book. Harron (the writer/director) opted to shift the focus away from the killings and create a satire that highlights the excesses and obsessions of the era, for example, the scene where the characters compare their business cards feels almost pornographic.  Likewise, Patrick's constant analysis of pop music (he must intellectualize why he listens to it rather than simply enjoying it) is ridiculous as there is little substance to it at the best of times, but again it is an attempt to establish superiority and depth.<br/><br/>
Christian Bale is electrifying as the narcissistic serial killer, but ultimately he is too good - his character is so bereft of humanity that he seems plastic and eventually becomes nothing more than a walking, stalking ken doll who is more laughable than menacing. <br/><br/>What could have been a clever indictment of the Me Decade, ultimately fails for trying to be too clever and impersonal."

I had been told that it was gory and was preparing myself to be completely grossed out.  However, I was not at all grossed out.  I thought that the murder scenes were tastefully done and left much to the imagination.  For me, that allowed me to focus more on the plot and less on just some graphic scenes. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, there is actually a plot.  We slowly follow an already disturbed man into the depths of insanity.  What is especially intriguing is the fact that he realizes that he is insane. I have to say that Christian Bales' performance is definitely oscar-worthy. Just the fact that at one moment you can think that he is a very good looking guy and then the next think that he is one of the ugliest people shows his outstanding range and understanding of the character.  I agree with many, however, that Reese Witherspoon was severely miscast in this part. She does not possess the sophistication (in looks mostly) to portray that part, no matter how small that part was. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to see a movie that stays with them and forces them to think about it for hours afterward.<br/><br/>P.S.

He goes through about 25 emotions at once, amazing. As for the rest of the cast as far as i'm concerned they were wasted. Especialy Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon. Dafoe is a great actor he just dosen't have anything to work with. Reese Witherspoon is a good actress, but I think she was miscast. I also think Chloe Sevigny was miscast as Jean also.

","A film with the history of AMERICAN PSYCHO behind it hardly needs a plot summary but it's still likely a lot of audiences will be surprised by what greets them. The film comes to the cinema with an almost unqualified endorsement from its creator, Brett Easton Ellis. Ellis, whose 1991 novel divided and disturbed audiences, has called Mary Harron's film 95 per cent faithful to the source material. <br/><br/>This is surprising because AMERICAN PSYCHO is a few novels at once: a black comedy about soulless eighties culture; a feminist tome about `crazy insane sexism and misogyny' (the authors words); a trip inside the head of a serial killer. The word `unfilmable' comes to mind, a tired phrase that has been proven wrong too many times before.<br/><br/>To Harron's credit, the film has captured the attention of a strong, rational audience base while avoiding the expected media hoopla. There is no grey area this time around. AMERICAN PSYCHO is played as black comedy and it hits the mark most of the time.<br/><br/>Beginning with a crafty credit sequence that teases the audience, Harron and star Christian Bale proceed to subvert their expectations. Bale hits the perfect note of satire,  ridiculing and patronising the idiot Bateman. In a recent interview, Bale said he hung out with yuppies to get a feel for the character and they told him to watch WALL STREET. Life imitates art imitating shallow, empty lives. Forgive the terribly mishandled twist late on (a costly lapse in directorial judgement) and AMERICAN PSYCHO rewards handsomely. One of the best films of 2000."

","Now, I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel on which this film is based. I thought I should get that right out in the open to start with.  Because many of you may wish to stop reading this review right now, because I didn't really like American Psycho, but I somehow think that would be different if Ihad read the book first.<br/><br/>This film has been out for a week or so now; even earlier if you caught it at the various film festivals around the country.  I rose out my lethargy to write a review of this film after reading Malcolm Knox's excellent article on the book and film in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald Spectrum liftout.  Dig it out and have a read, it is quite interesting.<br/><br/>Anyway, as I said, the book looks like it might be a pre-requisite for not only viewing, but enjoying this rather black thriller/comedy.  It uses the old Kubrick standby of making lots of things very white and contrasted, the direct opposite to what is being portrayed in the film.<br/><br/>So what do we have?  We have a yuppie, Patrick Bateman, going quietly mad with all the corporate life swimming around him.  And he just snaps and starts killing people.  Or does he?<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is that the ambiguity over the deaths is left right until the end, to allow the viewer the chance to fully wallow in the murderous spree Bateman revels in, without the distraction of thinking ""now did that happen or not?"".<br/><br/>To give him his worth, Christian Bale is quite good as the killer; a well mannered, precise kind of 80's music loving guy who suddenly starts having a lot of bad days.<br/><br/>He typifies in all of us perhaps what we would like to do in real life.  Who can honestly say that at some point in their lives they haven't wanted to kill a work colleague?  Without getting too much into Monty Python territory here I will leave it at that.<br/><br/>As I said, I truly believe an appreciation of the book is important to the enjoyment of this film, even if you just read some well researched reviews of it first.

","Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel AMERICAN PSYCHO had some of the crazy snap you read about from first-time consumers of NAKED LUNCH back in the day. Universally condemned, its anti-eighties satire was none too subtle but beautifully fashioned by Ellis: the tale of an outwardly impregnable but inwardly demented un-soul, told in the voice of an irritable, funny, quick, spoiled, slightly gay frat boy. The power of the book comes from that voice, and from Ellis' virtuoso use of form--as we imagine ourselves into Ellis' fictional space, we find ourselves trapped in an airless, characterless, mannequin-filled vacuum.<br/><br/>But it's funny--explosively, forbiddenly funny. That's the one element the writer-director Mary Harron gets on the nose in her adaptation, the first hour of which scores in the same way Milos Forman's MAN ON THE MOON did--by ripping off a really funny guy's best routines and just playing 'em straight out. Harron and her co-adapter Guinevere Turner find some nice opportunities to make Ellis' designer-drone prose cinematic--like wacko Patrick Bateman's choice to preface every murder he commits with a full-career review of an eighties AM-radio hack. (The exegesis on Phil Collins, followed by bloodbath, suggests the influence of the Ezekiel shtik from PULP FICTION.) And Christian Bale, an unlikely-looking Patrick Bateman, gives a daring conceptualized performance. Conceiving of Bateman as a non-self, Bale playacts goofily, as if cutting up for his fellow actors between takes. Since no one takes anything Bateman says seriously--even his confessions of gruesome crimes--Bale is free to thumb his nose and make googly eyes at everyone in the movie. He does so with an enormous charm that recalls Malcolm McDowell abjuring ""the old in-out.""<br/><br/>In the last twenty minutes, as Bateman melts down, Gets Real, and enters a hairline-fracture maze of what's-real-and-what-isn't, Harron seems to take cues from Cronenberg's distorted-self tragedies. Well, she ain't no Cronenberg--though John Cale's score seems to ape Howard Shore's music for the Canadian master, and the production design tries (and fails) to be DEAD RINGERS punctilious. The movie ends with an unsatisfying splotch. (Ellis' draft of the script ended with a musical number outside the Statue of Liberty--an equally hopeless but more game solution.) In small roles, Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe are, as they say, ""overcast,"" and Chloe Sevigny forms a small delta of sweet hurt feeling as the overlooked secretary who needs someone to tell her she's pretty. Sevigny responds to kindness like a shy cat getting a rub on the neck. Her byplay with Bale is worth diamonds."

","Sometimes it's hard for movie reviewers to adequately discuss heavily artistic movies.

The movie is so heavily dosed with abnormal scenes, viewers have to decide for themselves the message being sent.<br/><br/>	Christian Bale plays a successful businessman in the 1980s with an insatiable appetite for killing. The movie is more of a confession than it is a story, with Bale's character becoming more insane with each passing scene.<br/><br/>	""American Psycho"" is a bit like ""American Beauty"" in its overwhelming artistic endeavors. What ""American Beauty"" did for suburbia in the 1990s, ""American Psycho"" tries to do for yuppie life in the 1980s. Both try to act as examples of what actually happens behind the facades of those who are rich and successful.<br/><br/>	The movie also has a pretty remarkable, although underused, cast. Reese Witherspoon, Chloë Sevigny (nominated for an Oscar in ""Boys Don't Cry"") and Willem Dafoe all make appearances in the film, but really not much more than that.<br/><br/>	However, Bale is spectacular as both a stuck-up yuppie and a psychopathic killer. What makes his performance - and the movie, for that matter - so disturbing is how believable Bale is at playing both parts at the same time, as well as being able to make the transition from one character to another.<br/><br/>	Another disturbing element of the film is the haunting mixture of comedy with horror. One of the most amusing scenes in the film shows Bale's character becoming angry because of the impressive embossing of his co-workers' business cards. It's humorous, yes, but sickening when combined with the fact that he plans on killing one of the men because of the business card.<br/><br/>	In spite of some troubling scenes in the film, ""American Psycho"" still has the ability to be a rewarding film for viewers.

He has gotten a job in his daddy's firm and spends all day listening to CDs while his secretary does his work for him. Whenever he and his equally despicable buddies (or is that ""cronies""?) get together, they brag about their business cards. When Patrick sees that his friend Paul has a ""better"" business card, that's the end of Paul.

","*Contains Spoilers*<br/><br/>While watching this movie I had the feeling that someone wanted to make a basically ordinary slasher movie, but ended up doing an ordinary slasher movie trying to masquerade as some kind of intelligent movie, so people watching the movie can say what an intelligent movie they have watched lately. But the movie is not intelligent. I know this movie is based on a book, but since I haven't read it I can only talk about the movie itself. First of all, the dimwittedness of the movie is betrayed by the character called ""Luis"". The idea may be ok that he admits to be in love with the other man and always kept it a secret up to now, since this shows that the emotions the people show are fake. But this all is spoiled by adding the usual brainless cliches attached to same-gender attracted men to the character: his effeminate behavior etc. From the first moment you see him, you know that if the movie is as bad as you think it is, he will be revealed to be same-gender  attracted. And the scene where he reveals his love is so ridiculous! Sure, if somebody puts his hands around my neck indoors in black leather gloves, the first thing that comes to my mind is that he loves me! There where one or two more scenes that betrayed the usual odd uneasiness of this kind of movies with same-gender attraction. The final scenes in the flat, and the killing of Christie are just the usual slasher-movie scenes. But, the idea that when he throws the chainsaw at her from the top of the stairs while she is at the lowest level and *actually* hits her while running is so dumb I couldn't help laughing! I mean, if this was just an ordinary slasher flick it would be ok, maybe even big fun, but *this* movie wants to pretend to be intellectual? Please! In his final speech Paul simply says nothing, but in a very complex way.<br/><br/>Oh yes, and his name: Bateman. Hmm, does this ring a bell? Norman Bates? Boy, how original. But I liked the characters of Christie and Jean, and the actresses portraying them. I also liked the actress that had the line ""Don't come back"" at the end of the movie. But what I really didn't like was that a song by the Mediaeval Baebes is wasted in a trashy movie like this! Sure, Bale has a hot body, but that doesn't save the movie. So, don't waste your time."

","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) has a problem. It's not work. It's not women. It's definitely not money. Nor is it his IQ, looks, shower routine or sense of fashion. You see, Patrick just can't stop killing. Men, women, friends, foes, cats, dogs, you name it he'll slay it. Butcher knives, kitchen knives, nail-guns, hand-guns, axes, chainsaws, coat-hangersyou name it he'll use it. And yes, at a glance, American Psycho may sound, seem and look like your average, banal slasher flick, but it isn't. In fact, it's far from it.<br/><br/>Adapted well enough from Brett Easton Ellis' seminal novel, American Psycho is a sharp, blacker than black character driven comedy. Yes, comedy. Comic in that the silkiness of the satire is so finely woven into the somberness of the subject matters (violence, rape, mental- illness, social decay) that the end product is sheer flimic and lyrical porn fit for any cult following. And even though its dry, wry humour may not be for everyone, writer/director Mary Harron's big-screen spin on one of modern fictions' most important texts is wildly entertaining; not as deep or profound or cutting as Ellis' original tale, but as a stand- alone film- it's a success.<br/><br/>Like the book, Harron's Psycho is set in a mid-to-late 1980's Manhattan but speaks for today. It centers on the life of 27 year old Wall Street high-flier and our least noble of narrators, Patrick Bateman. A neurotic, athletic, vain and designer-branded emblem of the mass- consuming chauvinists whose focal thoughts involved, well, money, sex and status. But Bateman is going through what can only be described as an identity crisis-cum-killing binge (""I need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale""). His ""mask of sanity"", as he so metaphorically states, is beginning to slip and after taking an axe to one of his firm's finest chief execs', Bateman has to juggle his homicidal, sadomasochistic hobbies with unwanted attention from both Detective Donald Kimble (William Dafoe) and flakey fiancé Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) all the while remaining on the ball at ""work"" and vigorous in his grooming and exercise routines (he can do a thousand stomach crunches y'know).<br/><br/>American Psycho, then, is a quite excellent, frivolous yet brain-teasing depiction of the distinct and now laughable mentality of the coke-fueled souls who reveled in the sheer bliss of 1980's pulp pop-culture. Released a decade on from its passing, Harron is able to channel the mindset of so many money-obsessed egomaniacs through just one, all be it extreme, character. And what a character. Bateman is erratic, embarrassing, dangerous, a Whitney Houston nut, Huey Lewis buff and connoisseur of all things mainstream. A character so deeply consumed by himself that he's an important yet utterly ridiculous commitment to fiction; an absolute blast to watch and behold (""I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?"") Christian Bale operates so well within the role of Bateman that it's hard to think of any other actor that could've done a better job. It's a breakthrough performance riddled with humour, horror and meaning; emotion, class and confidence. Not only does the Welshman's captivating performance personify the mood and pacing of the tale, but shuns any memories regarding the likes of Edward Norton and Leonardo Di Caprio being originally cast for the role. He brings Ellis' icon to life and is, perhaps, the finest thing to come out of Harron's adap' (excluding the hilarious business card scene).<br/><br/>Credit also has to be given to Harron, though. Converting one of the most violent and controversial novels of all time into a film was never going to be easy. The unproven female director has tailored the tale for the screen well enough, though. It's refreshing to see the female half of the craft take on a film so unconventional, daring and, when the chauvinistic mannerisms of the male lead are taken into account, paradoxical.<br/><br/>Harron is able to inject ample substance and candour into particularly violent scenes by positioning the camera just a few inches away from the actual point of visual violence. An effective technique that evokes not visual shock, but mental. Harron demands that we imagine what the camera isn't showing us. Which is often worse thus paying off. Especially in the set-to-be infamous yet cult-embraced ""Huey Lewis and the News"" sequence. Which brings me smoothly onto John Cales' decade-defining soundtrack. Chock full of memorable eighties hits from Robert Palmer to Phil Collins, New Order to Chris De Burgh, Cales' song selection is straight-out of the pages of Ellis' book and is as bolstering to the placement of the tale as the sophisticated, counteracting piano score that overrides Bateman's humorous monologues.<br/><br/>As far as black and bold comedies go, American Psycho is right up there with the very best. It's a stylish, ingenious and disturbing revamp of a better book which brings to mind the likes of John Landis, Stan' Kubrick and the Coens. It's a candid, instant-success on behalf of the cast, Mary Harron and Christian Bale especially. Expect more from him."

","I love Christian Bale just as much as any other Welsman, but the movie, ""American Psycho"" was NOT, I repeat, NOT credible to the book. It moved so quickly, and seemed really to have no point. I read the book before I saw the movie, and was really excited to see the movie. My boyfriend and I went to Movie Gallery every weekend to check to see if it was in. Finally, when it was we rented it. By the beginning of the movie, it started in like chapter 7! This might make sense in essence of time, but it made Bateman seem like a senseless killer who randomly puts on plastic coats and axes people in his apartment. It doesn't touch upon the subject of him losing his identity and falling into the pit of the eighties, just him discussing Evian with his friends, then at a club, then killing someone. I am not sure if it really is supposed to be a movie because so much of the book is internal. For example, the description of Phil Collins was its own chapter in the book, but in the movie he was describing it to the two prostitutes. This does make sense, I guess, but it is just another flaw that really did deplete from the character of Patrick Bateman. To someone who hadn't read the book, they would have just thought, ""This is a man who is really full of himself, likes sex and kills people for no reason. What an asshole!"" Essentially, that is how it could be viewed, but the aspect of his identity, esteem and human need to really be accepted was not thrown into the mix at all, and I think that's what it was missing. Also, it was not bloody enough. Haha, I'm kidding. Oh, yeah, and we watched the edited version, maybe that was the problem. No, I don't think it was. More blood could have only made it 40% better."

But after reading a few explanation articles, it seems that the director herself admits that she didn't execute it well, and that Bateman actually did commit all those crimes. It's just the Wall Street elite lifestyle that saved his a**- the common mistaking identities problem, and of course the fact that no one wants to believe you're a murderer, cause of course that's not possible, right?<br/><br/>I'm guessing the book is better than the movie, as they ALWAYS are, although I haven't read it as of yet."

","It's just as well a woman directed ""American Psycho."" She's transformed a novel about blood lust into a movie about men's vanity. A male director might have thought Patrick Bateman, the hero of ""American Psycho,"" was a serial killer because of psychological twists, but Mary Harron sees him as a guy who's prey to the usual male drives and compulsions. He just acts out a little more.<br/><br/>Most men are not chain-saw killers; they only act that way while doing business. Look at the traders clawing each other on the floor of the stock exchange. Listen to used-car dealers trying to dump excess stock on one another. Consider the joy with which one megacorp stock-raids another and dumps its leaders. Study such films as ""In the Company of Men,"" ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" ""Boiler Room"" and the new ""The Big Kahuna."" It's a dog-eat-dog world, and to survive you'd better be White Fang.<br/><br/>As a novel, Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 best seller was passed from one publisher to another like a hot potato. As a film project, it has gone through screenplays, directors and stars for years. It was snatched up for Oliver Stone, who planned to star Leonardo DiCaprio, before ending up back in Harron's arms with Christian Bale in the lead. (To imagine this material in Stone's hands, recall the scene in Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"" where Tchaikovsky's head explodes during the ""1812 Overture,"" then spin it out to feature length.)<br/><br/>Harron is less impressed by the vile Patrick Bateman than a man might have been, perhaps because as a woman who directs movies, she deals every day with guys who resemble Bateman in all but his body count. She senses the linkage between the time Bateman spends in the morning, lovingly applying male facial products, and the way he blasts away people who annoy him, anger him or simply have the misfortune to be within his field of view. He is a narcissist driven by ego and fueled by greed. Most of his victims are women, but in a pinch, a man will do.<br/><br/>The film regards the male executive lifestyle with the devotion of a fetishist. There is a scene where a group of businessmen compare their business cards, discussing the wording, paper thickness, finish, embossing, engraving and typefaces, and they might as well be discussing their phalli. Their sexual insecurity is manifested as card envy. They carry on grim rivalries expressed in clothes, offices, salaries and being able to get good tables in important restaurants. It is their uneasy secret that they make enough money to afford to look important, but are not very important. One of the film's running jokes is that Bateman looks so much like one of his colleagues (Jared Leto) that they are mistaken for each other. (Their faces aren't really identical, but they occupy empty space in much the same way.)<br/><br/>The film and the book are notorious because Bateman murders a lot of people in nasty ways. I have overheard debates about whether some of the murders are fantasies (""can a man really aim a chain saw that well?""). All of the murders are equally real or unreal, and that isn't the point: The function of the murders is to make visible the frenzy of the territorial male when his will is frustrated. The movie gives shape and form to road rage, golf course rage, family abuse and some of the scarier behavior patterns of sports fans.<br/><br/>You see why Harron has called the film ""feminist."" So it is--and a libel against the many sane, calm and civilized men it does not describe. But it's true to a type, all right. It sees Bateman in a clear, sharp, satiric light, and it despises him. Christian Bale is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor.<br/><br/>When Bateman kills, it is not with the zeal of a villain from a slasher movie. It is with the thoroughness of a hobbyist. Lives could have been saved if instead of living in a high-rise, Bateman had been supplied with a basement, a workbench and a lot of nails to pound."

"Style_is_Substance","5","1","3","26 June 2016"," Underwhelming and Basic
","A film like American Psycho is one that attracts a certain type of person. Its primary fan base is youthful people with high adrenaline and desire to watch entertaining violence while also longing for more meaning that is easy and accessible to them. The meaning this type of people long for doesn't even have to be of much substance, as long as these viewers are able to understand it and justify their taste with a comment on the lines of ""no, it is good because it is satirizing violence, not condoning it"" even though there is a good chance this type of person also just enjoys this type of content already, rendering the satire aspect useless for the person's argument. <br/><br/>I don't think American Psycho is a particularly bad film, but I don't think it is a particularly good film. I believe this film relies too much on entertaining violence and its satire is rather flat. One should make close attention to Bale's role as Patrick Bateman. Bateman is rather a caricature, or at least his character is fairly static. However, while one could look at that as a negative, it isn't necessarily bad. The superficiality and lack of (for the most part) real dimension of the protagonist character can be argued to benefit from the notion that such people in his position of power themselves take on a public persona that in turn becomes who they are. Adopting said persona in this position could lead the individual to lack normal emotional and mental depth. Patrick Bateman as a character has little depth, and because of this, he fills the empty hole with the satisfaction of fulfilling hedonistic fantasies including misogyny and murder. The film opens with a scene of Bateman narrating about who he is as an individual, practically noting how superficial and empty he really is. To further the point, they have him applying a materialistic skin mask to develop who our protagonist is. Now, this is what the film sets up and has working for it. Unfortunately, as the film progresses, I feel the film focuses on the entertainment aspect of murder and misogyny (which admittedly is good in some scenes) up to the point that it overshadows satire and leaves it somewhat undeveloped. <br/><br/>I feel that American Psycho does not live up to what it sets up leading to a rather underwhelming and predictable climax. At least it was to me.<br/><br/>With this in mind some may wonder why certain people flock to defend the film? The answer is that it fits a formula and adopts tropes that some impressionable people like. Such tropes include insane serial killer protagonist, violent and sexual scenes played comically and set to popular music, and of course surface level satire to make the viewer feel smart for noticing and not guilty for enjoying the violence and sex. The film has its moments to shine, but ultimately falls flat. Not the worst, but far from the best.<br/><br/>I expect just solely due to my lukewarm rating and negative title, there will be fans who will mark this review as ""unhelpful."" Well, maybe not as much now that I addressed this."

"dunmore_ego","7","1","3","25 April 2008"," Exotic Psychotic
","About a yuppie serial killer who finds he is slowly going insane, not from killing people, but from the BOREDOM of doing so. This comedy is not just black - it's black with sprinkles on top and a human head on a spike.<br/><br/>From the hilariously disturbing Bret Easton Ellis novel of the same name (screenstoried by Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner, directed by Harron), *American Psycho* defines a new angle on the internal world of serial killers. <br/><br/>Our Hero is Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, ripped like a suspension bridge cable), a VP of his company, a 1980's uber-executive, whom we never see do any actual office work, narrating his obsessive-compulsive behaviors; petulant, trivial, rich, ensconced in yuppie consumerism; in a loveless, close-to-tears-of-exasperation relationship with his empty-skulled girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon), who is oblivious to his ambivalence and neuroses. He's also a serial killer. <br/><br/>Bateman's life is an endless succession of vapidity  exec friends who speak and never listen, women who speak only as prelude to bonking, fake parties, fake emotions, plastic girlfriends, all status and wardrobe and petty gossip. Every time he needs to exit an unsavory social situation, his excuse ""I have to return some videotapes"" is taken without question because no one is listening; when he is loading a body bag into the back of a taxi, a fellow exec catches him, only to marvel at the excellent ""overnight bag"" It is no surprise that Bateman's only grasp on ""reality"" is the solid hack of his axe on someone's skull. <br/><br/>When Bateman narrates an album review or describes pedantic rituals, his voice takes on the clinical detachment of an outside observer. And in that persona, his murders take place  observing himself as he is committing them. We feel the incongruous juxtaposition of personalities as he puts on a Whitney Houston CD and starts proselytizing on the philosophies of *The Greatest Love of All* as a prelude to killing two girls. And the black humor shines when he tells his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) during a date, ""You'd better go or I might hurt you,"" she thinking that he refers to the discomfort of office relationships, while he means it LITERALLY. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, the two FEMALE film-makers retain verbatim Ellis' misogynistic Truth about women with ""good personalities,"" voiced at a Boys Sitdown by Josh Lucas: ""There are no girls with great personalities. A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard-body, who'll satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her goddam mouth shut....""<br/><br/>With all the *CSI*s and *Law and Order*s abounding on our inculcating airwaves, one gets the impression that most murders are eventually solved. But *American Psycho* leaves us with the reality that there must be thousands of unsolved murders perpetrated by people like Bateman  murders that we will never hear of because they are so graphic; that would never air on *Cops* for fear of making the steroid bull-stars of that show look as impotent as we know they are. Though a detective (Willem Dafoe) passively questions Bateman on suspected missing persons (that he has eighty-sixed), the reality is that if someone in Bateman's VP position WERE a serial killer, the kid gloves would stay on; were he indicted, the charges would be harder to stick; were he convicted, his sentence would be commuted. This is how a money-based society treats its moneyed criminals. <br/><br/>It takes more brains, organization and creativity to be a serial killer than a cop. We are made privy to prosaic details when Bateman kills Paul Allen (Jared Leto); putting newspapers down to sop up the carnage when he chops him up, meticulously cleaning his fingerprints, packing a suitcase for the victim to make it look like he has gone on a trip, changing the message on the victim's answering machine, body bags, skulking skills, alibis, lying to the police so convincingly it's quite a task, and we almost admire Bateman for these forward-thinking skills, but then, maybe it's that same skill set that *all* vice presidents possess. We've always known you need to be pretty morally bankrupt yet a decisive mover-shaker, to attain executive corner offices. <br/><br/>With its plastic, pastel-tie soundtrack (featuring Phil Collins, Huey Lewis, Robert Palmer, et al), *American Psycho* captures the era when cellphones were the size of cereal boxes, also conveying the ultra-upper-class hedonism and juvenility of these spoiled-riche business-boys (Bateman is vexed when a colleague's eggshell-colored business card is better than his; simply devastated when another colleague's card has a watermark); and reminds us of the blasé sexism once accepted in the office (""Don't wear that outfit again - and wear high heels"")  but the movie never quite captures the disturbing horror or unbridled carnage of the Ellis novel.<br/><br/>Two reasons: Firstly, the book is the most violent story you will ever puke your guts out over - I especially remember the scene where Bateman grinds a circle saw into a woman's face and marvels at her teeth splattering outwards  and there's only so much disturbing gore the gutless, hypocritical MPAA will allow onto the screen at one sitting; secondly, the movie has been screenstoried and directed by women. Yes, it's a sexist comment  directly criticizing the fact that the female sex is trying to convey the male sex's point of view. And that can't be done  not by the most intelligent woman, not by transgenders, not even by Richard Simmons. Women cannot possibly fathom the sexual intent of *normal* red-blooded men, let alone the perverse sexual depravedness of a serial killer. How graphic, how ""sexually realistic,"" how authentic can the movie possibly be with these two hampering aspects? <br/><br/>The most extreme this movie gets is showing a naked Bateman, covered in blood, chasing a hooker through his apartment complex with a roaring chainsawand we've all done *that* before"

His life seems built on life's excesses and peer status - a typical upscale Manhattan yuppie in the 1980s. But he anything but typical: we learn he has a very dark side ... as a sadistic killer.<br/><br/>What was really fascinating to watch was his (and his friends') petty ""yuppie"" mannerisms and lifestyle. Their superficiality was very well done. A scene involving ""who has the better business card"" was amazing to watch.<br/><br/>However, the movie came up a little short in the second half. It is focused on his dark side. It was presented so as to be abrupt, sadistic, and shocking. However, it didn't quite come off as intense as intended. Maybe in 2000 it may have been more effective, but it wasn't too surprising to see a person with a normal side coexisting with a secret killer/crazy side.<br/><br/>It seems that this movie appeals to people who have read the book - so if that's you, you'll probably want to see this. For everyone else, it's not really worth the 100+ minute investment."
"labolabo","3","1","3","9 May 2007"," Very overrated
","I have just, for the third time, tried to watch more than just 15-30 minutes of this movie, without succeeding this time neither. Actually, I think it's a boring and exaggerated and unrealistic movie in many ways. Poor direction, poor acting (including the lead role), and disturbingly high (although quite good) music. I have nothing against movies about psychopaths or serial killers (like ""Henry, portrait of a serial killer""), but this movie just seems so very shallow and bad. I can't even see what's good in it. Why not instead create a more realistic movie? (English is not my native language so apologies for writing errors.)"
"film-critic","10","1","3","26 March 2007"," You're so vain. You probably think this film is about you.
","Who is Patrick Bateman? <br/><br/>A valid question for those reading this review. One must wonder if he is the socially elite of the New York business world, the prime example of an obsessive compulsive, or the face of evil itself with an endless expense account and an unquenched need to kill  kill  and kill again. Just like the illusive Tootsie-Roll Pop, the world may never know. Bret Easton Ellis penned him, director Mary Harron gave him the paved road, while Christian Bale gave us the face, the mannerisms, and the world of the unknown Bateman. For those unfamiliar, Bateman is a new sort of serial killer. Not quite the BTK or Bundy, but the terror certainly ranges from within. Living in a posh apartment, eating at the fanciest of restaurants, and enjoying all the pleasures of 1980s New York, Bateman struggles with himself and the need to kill time and time again. His victims, mostly prostitutes and business cohorts, suffer the worst (far worse in the book) punishments alive either from ax, nail gun, hanger, or the ever popular chainsaw. Pulling from pop culture, dark obsessions, and eerily our own desires, Bateman shows no conscious, no compassion, no rational thought for these crimes, he just kills and kills and kills.<br/><br/>Where this film takes a different element than you a-typical slasher film or horror genre is that midway through you begin to question the sanity of our anti-hero. Events transpire that catch both Bateman as well as the viewers off-guard. The biggest question is Paul Allen. The phenomenally understated Jared Leto delivers a mirror performance to Bale's as another suit in the business world. Due to accounts and business cards, Bateman dissolves the friendship  yet, everyone continues to see Allen walking the streets and having lunch with him. Even the detective hired for the case, one Donald Kimball (played by Willem Dafoe) seems to prove otherwise. Yet, something nags at our belief. This is only confirmed with an ending that will make you stop, rewind, and watch again. Questing everything from the mouth of Bateman, as well as his surroundings. Slasher film? Um, this reviewer would rather place it into the genre of self-discovery. There was a film entitled ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" that attempts to understand the meaning of life, but for me, ""American Psycho"" can do it like no other.<br/><br/>For anyone looking for that film that contains an amazing score, an ensemble of known actors giving us performances of a lifetime, and direction that both mimics and mocks the lifestyle in New York during the 80s  than ""American Psycho"" is the film for you. For me, I don't understand why it isn't further a staple of the film community. Christian Bale could not have been a better choice for the face of Bateman, his ability to transform himself into the character was outstanding. His character wasn't over the top, nor was it Bale being a character  he was Patrick Bateman. What is it with Bale  there hasn't been one underscored performance yet. ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", ""Velvet Goldmine"", and the ""Machinist"" are all within my top films of all time. ""American Psycho"" ranks above them all. Scenes, for me, that stand out are (2) major ones. The first, which proves that Mary Harron was the perfect choice to direct and that her decision to cast Jared Leto was directly on target is the scene with Leto and Bale as he prepares the ax and explains the lyrical juxtaposition of Huey Lewis. The language, the motions, and the choreography of the scene remains in my eyes, one of the strongest in cinema history. The second scene, while less cinematically inclined, is that of Bale running naked through the halls of his apartment, dawning only his tennis shoes (naked to the bone), with chain a-blazin' as he chases one of the escaping prostitutes. Again, maybe not the best in history, but a scene that constantly makes me laugh, shiver in terror, and remain in awe of the skill known as Christian Bale.<br/><br/>I would go so far as to say that this is a flawless film, though I must admit, the only issue that I have trouble with is the ever lacking bonus features on this disc. I have the original version released and it only has a handful of extras which are not anything to overly write about, but what ergs me is the ever lacking audio commentary that would have been great to hear about this story. Perhaps it would have included a bit more about the ending, less fog surrounding it, but not to worry  there is a newer version, the ""Uncut Killer's Collector's Edition"" that should remedy all of these missing elements.<br/><br/>Overall, ""American Psycho"" ranks among one of my favorite films of all time. While my list constantly grows, this remain a constant. I cannot speak any higher of Bale, or of Harron's direction which continues to impress me during each viewing. The music is what stood out in my eyes. There is a scene where someone laughs half-heartedly at a comment made by Bateman about liking Whitney Houston. I loved his interpretation of a Phil Collins song. It was these small elements that all came together perfectly for this film. ""American Psycho"" is a look within the business soul. As I watched this film, I thought of it as an extension to the ""Wall Street"" arm, could Gordon Gekko be Patrick's father? The insanity of New York, the pressures of working in a constantly obliterating corporate world, the standards of humanity  all blend together just far enough to make you question the existence of the man sitting next to you. For anyone who has ever worked for Corporate America  this is the film for you.<br/><br/>Now, I gotta go return some videos.<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"
"her_orion","10","1","3","8 March 2007"," Brilliant, a must buy!
","I watched this movie the first time not knowing that it was an adaptation of a novel by Bret Easton Ellis. I loved the movie. It's very rare to see a movie that makes me want to read the book, it usually works the other way, but I had to buy the novel, and now Ellis is one of my favorite authors. It's definitely a ""must buy,"" don't even waste your money renting it, BUY IT! Then buy the book!<br/><br/>The film doesn't have nearly as much content as the book, but none the less, is a personal favorite. It captures the superficial, materialistic aura of the 80's and exploits it in a beautiful way. Christian Bale captures the character ""Patrick Bateman"" in a way that is indescribable. I've always enjoyed his films, but now I'm a fan of Bale's work.<br/><br/>Like I said before, I watched the movie before I read the book. After words, I watched the movie again and was so disappointed about the amount of material that was cut out in order to make the movie short and easy to follow for movie-goers, but that's expected. Yet, the movie captures the essence of what Ellis is trying to portray in ""American Psycho."" Either way, this movie is easily in my top 10 favorite movies."
"cpt_morgan","10","1","3","6 March 2007"," Great Ending!
","I think the ending of American Psycho is a further step toward the completion of 'reaching for a masterpiece of art movie'! I do fully agree with the comment of ""grendel-37"" made in 2001, though the only part i have a different opinion is the ending of the film. I believe, there enough hint given as what happen To Bateman, it is what he chooses to do! Because ""his layer HAS BEEN IN London"" that night when he killed his competing colleague; in fact he was not! And that explains that he is not going in jail for his murders! And this ending is anxious for Bateman, because he just had a catharsis and now when is going to be the next one!? And i think that terrifies him, as he acknowledges it in some movie sequence!<br/><br/>And I do thoroughly, completely agree that the Directing is stunning... One more thing that entirely blew me away was camera work! Hitchkogian Cinematography! Brilliant!"
"Torgo_Approves","10","1","3","15 January 2007"," A video tape you'll never want to return!
","Christian Bale proves why he's the best actor of his generation, and one of the greatest in film history, as he dominates every single scene of this blood-splattered, sadistically hilarious, strongly and bluntly satirical, well polished and freakishly enjoyable work of comic art from one-hit-wonder Mary Harron. This is Bale's best performance, and most likely the one he'll be remembered for; I'm positive that long after the mega-hype for Batman Begins has died down, people will still be quoting the charming sociopath Patrick Bateman in their daily conversations.<br/><br/>We follow Mr. Bateman (successful, rich stockbroker at day, narcissistic, cold-blooded psychopath at night) through his repetitive, meaningless life - meeting friends at expensive restaurants, cheating on his fiancée, comparing business cards, unsuccessfully trying to get reservations at Dorcia's, watching the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, quoting Ted Bundy for laughs, having a slightly better haircut than Markus Halberstram - as his mask of sanity slips further and further down his chiseled face. No matter how good he looks, no matter how rich and pumped he gets, no matter how many girls he bones, he just cannot find pleasure in his life. There is only one thing left to do to get that adrenaline rush: chop your friends up with axes, chainsaws, and power drills! <br/><br/>The movie is very violent, although not in the pornographically gratuitous way that the Saw- or Hostel-type films are violent: we never really see anyone take an axe to the head and the actual acts of violence are left to our imagination. It is also not a movie to show to your grandmother (no matter how much of a sadist she might be) since it features some graphic sex scenes (nothing above soft-core level, though). Neither sex nor violence is the movie's main focus, however: this is a pitch-black comedy which is revoltingly, side-splittingly funny if you ""get"" its type of humour. The comedy stems mostly from the absurdity of the uber-shallow characters and their stuffed egos. Almost every conversation is absolutely hilarious and you'll find yourself quoting the film for the rest of your life. It truly sticks with you.<br/><br/>The acting is superb with Bale outdoing everyone even as the supporting cast delivers solid performances left and right. The supporting actors definitely know how to make the dialogue comical and I'd love to see more of Justin Theroux (Timothy Bryce) and Matt Ross (Luis Carruthers). Jared Leto is spectacular as always, providing one of the film's most memorable scenes (and most hilarious quotes) in a small but important supporting role. An underused Willem Dafoe also makes a very eerie guest appearance as the scariest police detective of all time.<br/><br/>The direction is also marvelous. Mary Harron successfully melds exhilarating segments of music with high tension, comedy, and scenes which are a little of both. The final result is nothing short of a masterpiece. I still can't find a flaw with it.<br/><br/>I haven't read the novel by Bret Easton Ellis (yeah, yeah, I know, I suck...) and cannot compare, but if it's anywhere near as good as this film I really have to seek it out. The film, on its own, is in my opinion one of the best ever made, and one of the most sadly overlooked. Trust me, you'll never listen to Phil Collins or Huey Lewis and the News the same way again. <br/><br/>Simply put? American Psycho rocks, period. It's a playful, but mysterious little movie. You'll love it."
"maximeslaperle","9","1","3","21 December 2006"," a great movie that delves in the psyche of man
","Sometimes, I cannot amaze myself enough of how a female director can understand the mind of men, so eloquently. In such, this is one of those violent movies that breathes a certain plastic beauty about it. It's not the kind of a plastic beauty that comes from a Scorsese movie, for Scorsese uses editing purposes to achieve that. For Mary Harron, this could be for her of a defining picture. It seems so good, that it relatively has no flaws. But we have not probably yet seen the full capacity of Harron as a director, the masterpiece could still be in the works. <br/><br/>What intrigues me is the very ""how"" of what makes her actually tick about men, despite the fact that American Psycho is an adaptation of an painstakingly horrible book written by Brett E. Ellis. It explains the huge difference it can make from one medium to another. To be honest from it's own writing style, it's a very sh--ty book. Not even amusing for one single bit. You throw it out even after ten pages. <br/><br/>It looks likes Harron can be very faithful to the novel's mentality, but adding on her foremost philosophy on men, coming from her own views. The movie is very crude in depicting the nothingness of male yuppies, living in the dystopia of N.Y. Everybody knows that new-yorkers are despicable bastards on their own time. And this shows this stereotype as it was evident, like morning daylight. Rich people don't have a speck of guilt in their whole f---ing beings, bourgeois and ignorant a--holes, who act like they own everybody, even the bums. This is what makes this movie bring out the just psychosis of it all. <br/><br/>You absolutely need to see this movie,a must. Then take my word for it, because it's one more good reason : i'm a goddamn proved literary genius."

","It has been a while since I saw the film ""American Psycho"", but I remember that it did not impress me. The film is about an executive who fantacizes about having affairs with and killing women with blond hair. The killings are gruesome ones reminiscent of slasher films. I remember there to be far much more gore than there was an artistic psychological aspect. All in all, this film was fairly disturbing and it is not the sort of film that you can expect to enjoy. I probably would not recommend it when you're about ready to go to bed either. Also, it was fairly boring and slow-moving. It probably makes a better book than a film."

","This is a great film adaption, that's very entertaining and somewhat disturbing, with a wicked cast, and a knockout performance from Christian Bale!. All the characters are great, and the story is very good as well, plus Christian Bale is simply incredible in this!. It's not overly graphic, but it still has many disturbing scenes, and while I have never read the book, I really enjoyed this movie, plus the ending is especially good, and will really make you think. While the performances were all very good, Bale carries the movie, as he played Patrick Bateman perfectly, and actually managed to give me the creeps, and I thought it was very well made and written as well, plus I also liked how unpredictable it was. The phone call Patrick made to his lawyer, was somewhat funny but also very disturbing at the same time, and I also found his obsession with music to be quite fascinating, plus I loved the dialog as well. All the characters are extremely likable, and Reese Witherspoon is a lot of fun as Patrick's whiny girlfriend Evelyn, plus everyone was perfectly casted. This is a great film adaption, that's very entertaining and somewhat disturbing, with a wicked cast, and a knockout performance from Christian Bale, I highly recommend this one!.<br/><br/>The Direction is great!. Mary Harron does a great! job here with very good camera work, solid angles, adding some good atmosphere, and just keeping the film at a very fast pace.<br/><br/>There is a little bit of gore, it is disturbing but not overly graphic. We get a person killed with a chainsaw (off screen), bloody bodies,severed head in a freezer, Axe in the face (off screen), gunshot wounds, and a bit of blood.<br/><br/>The Acting is outstanding!. Christian Bale is amazing as always and is incredible here, he truly is Patrick Bateman, he is chilling, creepy, likable in a weird sort of way, played insane incredibly well, was extremely intense, was simply fascinating to watch, and could have totally went OTT, but he Didn't,this is truly a dynamic performance! (Bale Rules!!!!!!!). Chloë Sevigny is very beautiful, and gives a charming performance here, she played it very simple and it worked, I really liked her, she is an underrated actress. Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always, and is brilliant in her role as Evelyn, I know her character is supposed to be annoying but I actually found her to be hilarious, especially her crying scene in the restaurant with Bale, sadly she Doesen't get enough screen time. (Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Josh Lucas does what he has to do very well I liked him, he is a great actor. Justin Theroux is OK with what he had to do which was not much. Samantha Mathis is cute, and does fine as Courtney, I liked her. Willem Dafoe is excellent as always, and here is no different he has a small but great role here, and as always had commanding screen presence (Dafoe Rules!!). Jared Leto is good as the pretty boy and was quite convincing. Cara Seymour is fine as the hooker, I felt sorry for her. Rest of the cast do fine.<br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5"
"selenedm999","5","1","3","13 August 2005"," the book was ahead of its time**possible spoilers**
","and the movie was a bit behind.<br/><br/>Although I try not to compare books and movies, because they are NOT the same medium, and for this reason don't occupy the same headspace, this movie made me realize all the reasons I enjoyed the book so much.<br/><br/>Bret Easton Ellis' novel was shocking for its time for a few simple reasons: mostly, in the movies if not in real life, the late 80s were perceived as a time of tremendous greed and affluence, but also of a strange kind of innocence, like little kids at play. Bateman's existence was one of endless consumption and of doing all the things that people watching beer commercials could only dream about. This led to a complete lack of morality or consequence, and his boredom led him to kill (at least in his own mind) because there really wasn't anything that he couldn't have or experience. He's the perfect textbook narcissist/sociopath, and at a time when psychology was still hanging onto the idea that killers are made out of abuse, not simply born to consume until something external takes care of them.<br/><br/>Next, the book was shocking because of its explicitness. The scenes of gruesome killings and the gratuitous sex were things that back then had only been around in the porn industry, but that was the point--if you have everything, where's the next kick? And in the late 80s (I believe the book came out in 1990 or 1991), when there wasn't nearly so much access to every kind of appetite imaginable, this concept still had the power to raise eyebrows. And turn stomachs.<br/><br/>The movie tries very hard, and it has its high points (particularly Christian Bale in the shower, whoot!)...but it was released a decade too late to really accomplish anything close to what the book did. And through the Nineties, with access to the Internet and sadomasochistic imagery on billboards, our access to the dark side of our own appetites has made Bateman's sex and killing kind of pedestrian, almost quaint. ""Oh, look, he's videotaping himself f**king a hooker, how cute!"" Even the D-I-Y spirit of the movie, casting Bale instead of a big Hollywood name draw, is just one in a long line of movies to take risks like that. ho hum. I was waiting to see the scene where he cuts off a head and screws it, and the only reference to that was the head in the refrigerator. What a letdown! And there were so many cruel yet comical scenes in the book that could have been in the movie without getting censored, like the scene where he dips a urinal cake in Godiva chocolate and feeds it to his girlfriend...where was that? Why was it cut in favour of his asshole friends yakkety-yakkety? At the end of the movie, you don't get the sense of relief that none of it was real the way you do reading the book. In fact, you only get the sense that it's another day, and for some reason, this doesn't bother you at all. I don't think that's quite what the director intended. It's not a bad movie by any means, and Bale is great eye candy, but it tries hard to remind us of the late 80s and we're made all the more aware that it's 2005. (or 2000, when the film came out)"
"leejgoldie","9","1","3","3 May 2005"," Appreciation of this film is found through watching it more than once!
","This film is the worst film i have ever seen in my life...was the first thing i said when i first saw it.<br/><br/>However after watching it a second time, I came to realise one thing...he is a PSYCHO! This might seem obvious given the title, but when watching it the first time, i was sitting there thinking, ""ok so he is going around killing people, big deal"" But on watching it for the second time it just hit me as he digs the axe into Jared Leto's back, this guy is a frigging' psycho!!<br/><br/>Again, this might sound stupid and obvious, but as i was watching it the first time i was like, ""ok so he is going around killing people for NO REASON, big deal"" Once again, during the second time round I realised that he psychotic mind WAS his reason! And thus i came to appreciate the meaning of the film! <br/><br/>Also, something that made me appreciate the film even more, was before watching it a third time, i came across ""American Psycho II"", i watched this...it was the worst film i have ever seen...but not in the way ""American Psycho"" was, this ACTUALLY was the worst film ever. Therefore, i decided to watch ""American Psycho"" again. My love for this film grew once more as i saw Christian Bale feeling the need to slaughter one of his best friends - just because he had the same business card as him! <br/><br/>You see, this film is not just about senseless violence, but more about the insanity that this anal, pedantic, American psycho brings to the screen (flawlessly by Bale)<br/><br/>Most definitely a film to see before you die!"
"imdb-20-scaramanga","6","1","3","26 April 2005"," Some books can't be turned into movies...
","If this film was a piece of its own, it would not be bad, but anyone who read the book sees: This film misses the monumentality of the book. While reading the book, you are disgusted by this man and his surrounding and get a deep insight into a society which always follows the money, a society which has used the ""American Dream"" that excessive that it is in danger to die. The reader of the book is bored by Bateman's wealth as he is. The reader misses any human behavior in that book for the first two third of the 550 pages. The reader is shocked by Bateman's only exciting things in his life of purified materialism: His sex and his violence, which is always connected.<br/><br/>To make that book into a film is almost impossible. No sane mind will produce a 4-hour movie which would be immediately banned in most countries. But even when your aim is not a total conversion of the book and all its aspects, you could have made it better. First: The movie is too short! When you read the book and then watch the movie, you are waiting for some long hours to come, but then, after only 100 minutes, the film suddenly is over. There isn't the growing boredom of viewing (or reading of) Bateman going to endless dinners. Second: The crimes of Bateman are belittled! Yes, there is a man running with a chainsaw (a scene that I can't remember from the book, maybe it even wasn't in it), a head in the fridge and some bodies in a wardrobe, but it does not create the shocking atmosphere of the book. Maybe with voice-overs of the original texts, you could have gotten this effect. Third: The surrealism is missing. When in the book, Bateman says to a barkeeper ""I want to play with your intestines"", the reader is not sure if it is in Bateman's mind or if it is reality. In the film, you see this without questioning it.<br/><br/>All in all the film may be a acceptable movie about a serial killer, but can never be as great as the book."
"irish_psycho","9","1","3","17 November 2004"," Impressive to say the least
","Impressed is the best way I can sum this movie up. In this movie we get a somewhat disturbing insight into the life of Pat Bateman a successful 27 year old living in 80's New York City. By day he works on Wall Street, only cares about himself and lives the yuppie lifestyle. His only interests are to look good and be on top of the social ladder. By night he is quite a different character, hooking up with prostitutes, killing and mutilating people. The whole film centers on Bateman who is perfectly played by Christian Bale and is looked at through his eyes with narration for most of the film by himself.<br/><br/>Direction is excellent by Mary Harron who captures the character of Pat Bateman excellently from the one depicted in the book.<br/><br/>I never really realized the concept of a black comedy until I saw this. Some of the scenes are quite graphic in nature depicting horrible things to people but yet you still find yourself laughing at it. You may think am I a psycho laughing at this kind of stuff but then you realize its OK as the way it is presented is humorous.<br/><br/>For materialistic people you will find a close connection with Bateman and all will most likely laugh till your hearts content from start to finish. In addition I would also recommend the book to anyone who enjoys the film as it expands the story a little more but not essential as the film stands great on its own. I actually saw the film before reading the book.<br/><br/>This film isn't obviously for everyone but if you liked 'The Last Supper' this should be a safe bet to watch and enjoy.<br/><br/>Excellent 9* out of 10"

","Maybe its me as I took 3 watches and a read of the book to fully or think I fully understand this film . But now I finally do I think that this is one of the most cutting an important pieces of work on the society we live in today . Bateman is a parody on what we live in in this day and age whether he did it or not I don't think really matters as if he did then the film is commenting on how people around him are so self obsessed and image focused and he is so unimportant (even though he thinks by buying a new watch or suit makes him important )that nobody pays any attention and that is a comment on life in general that no matter what evil happens everybody keeps there head down and carrys on obsessed with what they have and getting every available advantage (perceived) on there fellow man. If he didn't then it shows the evil of the man and men inside ,I don't think the end is to ambiguous as the comment he makes at the end of ""Inside doesn't matter"" sums up the whole movie in one sentence that Image is the most important thing .The movie itself is practically a comedy there are parts that have me in tears of laughter one minute ,but equally I could be in fits of revulsion the next ,all I can say is that it is just a brilliant satire on Image and life and everyone should watch it it is that important it will go down as a cult classic .As for the acting Christian Bale is excellent as the yuppie serial killer who wants to fit in I think he is absolutely perfect for the role ,Dafoe does a good turn playing on Batemans paranoia as you never no if Dafoe is setting the trap for him or is it just his mask of sanity finally slipping .A final comment on the gore if you have ever read the book then you would understand that you could not put that in celluloid it would be too much Mary Harron has balanced it perfectly the hints at murder and gore are far more powerful then just having some kind of slasher flick which are usually terrible anyway my score 8/10"

","American Psycho was a little too dirty. I didn't enjoy seeing so many nude shots with the prostitutes or the bed scenes with that pot-head chick Bateman was having a affair with, Some of that could have been cut out or shortened, but for the most part I enjoyed this movie. Some scenes were really funny. I feel bad for thinking that Bateman's behavior was funny, because the film isn't categorized as a dark comedy, but there are plenty of scary scenes. Bateman is charismatic, intelligent, classy, and frightening. I applaud Christian Bale for taking on this role. Lately he's been casted as sadistic, scary characters that audiences can't help but take an interest in. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see him as Batman. He'll play it deliciously. I hope he plays the sadist again - he does it so well - not that I don't love his singing, dancing, Disney side (because I do)."

","When I first saw American Psycho, I didn't like it. It wasn't because it was poorly made or anything, it was just wildly different from what I was expecting. A couple years after seeing it, I gave it a second chance and thought it was a near masterpiece. <br/><br/>While the book was great in pushing the limits and seeing how far it could go in the extremities of violence, this was more toned down and focused on the psychological aspect rather than the violent aspects.<br/><br/>This film does great in balancing the disturbing imagery and attitude with the black humor of the 80's yuppie scene.<br/><br/>WARNING: THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS It took me a while to like the ending, because when I first saw it I was completely confused, because it made no sense at the time. But when I look at it now, I like that on a level it changes the entire film. It suggests two things, 1) That he is not Patrick Bateman, that he took his identity like he did with Paul Allen. 2) That the entire film was a figment of his imagination. The fact that he's not able to be caught is his own personal hell. This would also explain why when he would admit to people that he had killed people no one either took it seriously or they ignored it all together. These are the kind of endings in a film that I like, ones that completely changes your perception of the film that you just finished watching.<br/><br/>All in all, even though the book and film are different in tone, both are equally excellent in there own way.

So I bought it at a car-boot sale and read it. Fantastic. It was this made me want to see the film and I loved it.<br/><br/>The movie does the book credit. Details that might have been omitted (in a typical Hollywood adaptation...) weren't and kept the story flowing. Patrick Bateman, played to perfection by Christian Bale, is the epitome of corporate America in the 80's... he just happens to be a psychopath. The recurring theme of mistaken identity is well used and the satire on the Wall Street businesses is excellent.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>I think the ending is not saying that he has imagined these killings. My view is that it is the film going full circle; all the way through, people are referred to by other names and in the end, it is this same phenomenon that allows Bateman to literally get away with murder. Whether he killed the wrong guy (he prides himself on knowing everyone but it would fit in with the theme if he is mistaken) or the lawyer has had lunch with another guy he mistook for Paul Allen, Bateman is off the hook and free to continue his double life. The end scene is an acknowledgement of the fact. If no-one knows or believes that a murder has been committed, has one really occurred...<br/><br/>*** END OF SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as a fan of the book, I must say that certain issues were skirted; I was particularly disappointed with the way the chainsaw was worked into the film but can see the logic behind it. On the whole, however, this is one of the best adaptations I have seen. A cult book has become destined to become a cult movie, I feel.<br/><br/>8/10 as I feel that given a longer playtime, the plot could have been more flowing."

","""American Psycho,"" which was one of the most controversial novels published in the last decade, makes for one of the most stellar, elegant book-to-film translations in quite some time.  An indictment of '80's excess, the focus is on a young, extremely wealthy Wall Street yuppie named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, who's excellent) whose lust for material status and conformity leaves him disgusted with his fellow man.  He vents his frustration and boiling rage by murdering boastful coworkers and vacant, oblivious prostitutes in all manner of ghastly ways (although, to be fair, the film comes nowhere near the graphic detail of the book).  Marry Harron and cowriter Guinevere Turner have done a commendable job of organizing the scattered passages of the novel into something of a coherent narrative, and the film is alive with bright, elegant cinematography and gallows of wickedly dark humor.<br/><br/>8/10"

Christian Bale played Bateman perfectly, so did Resse Witherspoon play Evelyn and Samantha Mathis play Cortney and Matt Ross play Luis Carruthers and Guinevere Turner play Elizabeth and so on.<br/><br/>There was one scene in the book that was omitted from the movie that I would have like to see portrayed.  It was the scene in Barney's where Luis Carruthers is crying and groveling at Bateman's feet in front of a crowd of people and Luis asks why Patrick does not love him and Patrick (in his frustration) tells Luis the reason for this is because he does not ""find (Luis) sexually attractive"".  Patrick then thinks to himself ""I can't believe I just said that"".  That scene would have fit perfectly in this film."

","American Psycho is a disturbing movie filled with the brutal murders and executions of various people (mostly of the female persuasion). What's really scary is that through much of the movie, our funny bone is being tickled. Don't get me wrong, we're not being persuaded to think that bloody killings are good; on the contrary, we're laughing at the complete banality of the man perpetrating these actions.  Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale, in a star-making turn) is a shallow Wall Street banker who lives an empty life. He lives and dies by a soda pop advertising slogan: Image Is Everything. Set in the late 1980s, he is of a time when style reigns supreme over substance, obsessed with his physical beauty, getting into the trendiest restaurants, and nitpicking with his coworkers about who has the best business cards. Said co-workers (Jared Leto, Matt Ross, Justin Theroux, and Josh Lucas), all have the same haircut and business suits, and for all intents and purposes are interchangeable. Bateman's sex life isn't exactly lacking, by any means. He's engaged to the shallow Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but cheats on her with her best friend Courtney (Samantha Mathis). He picks up a hooker off the street (Cara Seymour) and gets her in a threesome with another one of his friends, Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner, who co wrote the script).<br/><br/> His secretary Jean (Chloe Sevigny) also secretly lusts after him. Little does she know that he seems to have knocked off his best friend Paul Allen (Leto), a nameless homeless man, and countless members of the fairer sex, all by increasingly imaginative killing methods (staple gun, chainsaw, ATM machine -- he tries it all). Eventually he finds he's being trailed by detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe), who's investing Allen's disappearance but also seems to know a bit more about Patrick than he should. From this moment on Bateman's inner demons are unleashed as he descends into an unending frenzy of paranoia and murder.<br/><br/> As if we needed proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis can lead to a homicidal rampage, here comes American Psycho to ice pick the point home. Some of the funniest scenes depict Bateman's attempts at foreplay: the dissection of songs he considers classic. Such songs include Genesis' ""In Too Deep,"" Katrina And The Waves' ""Walking On Sunshine,"" Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love Of All,"" and Huey Lewis And The News' ""Hip To Be Square."" His interpretation of ""The Greatest Love Of All"" is especially hilarious.<br/><br/> As Bateman, Christian Bale is absolutely perfect. I remember him as the skinny little boy from Empire Of The Sun and Newsies, and as young Laurie in Little Women. To see him as the buffed-up soulless banker is a complete shock ... and a delightful one. The man is absolutely amazing in the role. Too bad American Psycho barely registered at the box office, because this is one performance that deserves an Oscar. Bateman is continually acting at being a human being. Bale brings the right amount of slightly over-the-top zeal required for the role, and actually succeeds in making us both laugh at and, at times, with his character. The rest of the characters are minor, and barely register, although Sevigny's lovelorn secretary hits a bit harder than most of the others.<br/><br/> Once again the MPAA has messed it up again. There was a huge controversy a while ago about the film being rated NC-17, which in the United States is another word for saying ""X-rated."" Its reasons were that there was a threesome being depicted. I was able to see the uncut version, and I must ask the question and rebel against the standards by asking: what were they thinking? So they show three people getting it on. Big deal. No actual penetration shots were shown ... just two naked women, dancing around and kissing while Bateman flexes and watches himself in the mirror. If anything, it helps reinforce the complete emptiness of Bateman's personality. The violence and gore, on the other hand, makes one almost queasy at times. Even with the amount of bloodshed, enough of it is off-camera that I wouldn't quite stoop to give it an NC-17 rating, but American Psycho is definitely an R-rated picture. Just goes to show once again what prudes the MPAA are. ""Yes, let's torture women and show their severed heads as much as possible; but don't show any naked people even though we're born that way: kids might get the wrong idea!""<br/><br/>While most definitely not for all tastes (I don't think this is high on the Mormon Church's ""required viewing"" list) American Psycho still manages to be both funny and disturbing at the same time. It's not as powerful as Fight Club, but it definitely packs a wallop. If you can get past the subject matter, you'll find yourself challenged and yes, even entertained. Skip the popcorn this time around, though."
"jangu","7","1","3","24 October 2002"," Almost perfect despite the ugly storyline
","Oh, it could have been a very very bad movie indeed. The infamous novel is very horrifying and contains the most graphic descriptions of murder and mayhem I have ever read. Oliver Stone, who was to direct, probably would have made a much darker movie with the violence turned up at least a notch or two.<br/><br/>As it is, Mary Harron has chosen not to be too graphic but stays tasteful all through the picture, even when the action gets bloody. And there is still plenty of gushing gore and since you don't see everything, the impact of the murders, when they arrive, is even more immediate. However, don't expect a slasher movie.<br/><br/>
But at the center of it all is Christan Bale as Patrick Bateman. Shallow, self-aware, greedy, narcissistic and completely nuts! As a portrait of a man who has no soul and only exists when he can experience the `high' of murder or have the most stylish business card in his firm, his performance is truly chilling. He is machine, not human, who delights in others pain and degradation, except for one scene in his apartment with his sweet secretary. When he realizes that a murderous rage may be imminent he tells her to get home because `he might hurt her'. Hmmm, in what sense one may wonder? Just kidding. Anyway, at that point, there is a subtle sense that he MIGHT be salvaged by this girl and that he longs for a life that is real.<br/><br/>
Christian Bale was apparently not a first choice for the part but seeing him here I doubt that anyone could be a better choice (certainly not Leonardo DiCaprio). He is excellent. Actually I didn't know he had it in him and thought of him as a child actors who's work as an adult had been, at best, indifferent. Clearly playing the part of Bateman is a challenge and had American Psycho been a turkey, it could most certainly had been one nail in his career coffin. Brave man! The other parts are also well casted and well played, but it is Bale who has the center stage.<br/><br/>
Praise must also go to Mary Herron who handles this unpleasant story in a manner as to say: Look, Bateman is a man just like most other men but he just go a little bit further. The script that she and Guinevere Turner has fashioned is an extremely interesting look at male behavior. However, if there is something amiss, it is the lack of someone remotely sympathetic. ChloÃ« Sevigny is the exception but she is too bland to be really interesting. All the others are people you would cross the street to avoid! That way you are never very upset when one of Batemans victims `gets it' because you don't really care. But otherwise excellent!"

","The complexity of Patrick Bateman (and the style in which Bale portrays him) are what carry this film from beginning to end.

I can't write much about this film without referencing the great scenes which carried it (the Paul Allen-Bateman interaction is excellent), but since I will do my best to avoid spoiler-status, it is a film that should be watched at least a second time to fully enjoy the evolving introduction to Patrick Bateman!"

","American Psycho was a book I read years ago - and it made a big impression. The book is not for people wanting a quick horror thrill, because the psychology is much deeper (& about 300 pages longer).<br/><br/>I found this movie a very rare treat - an incredibly deep book transposed to film without losing the core of what it was about; a quite darkly satirical comedy.<br/><br/>While much of the material in the book is lost, many subtle details remain: why Patrick has a polished wooden floor, and a fully equiped kitchen (although thankfully the chapter: ""Man Attempts to Eat Girl"" is removed, although still referenced). Patricks nail-gun is a treat for anyone who remembers the book, and made me ask how far the film can go.<br/><br/>Several very funny lines were also kept: Patricks ""Merger and Acquisition"" joke, and of course: ""Why yes Paul, this is a raincoat"".<br/><br/>The films real triumph is Christian Bale as Patrick. I had wondered how Patrick could be created, but amazingly Mr Bale managed to give Patrick the self-serious edge and humour which highlights his insanity.<br/><br/>I recommend anyone serious about analysing the film read the book. Otherwise, remember the book had more about Patricks further decent into madness, and has been so respected such that some sections kept can seem pointless or disjointed.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the books shattering ending is kept: [WARNING: BIG SPOILER] - that in the real world bad people CAN get away with it.<br/><br/>CRobson (Crashinoz)"

","My god, what a mess.  Started off with some interest, was kicky in parts, especially the send-up of '80's nouvelle cuisine, the main character's job that involved no observable work, and the analysis of Huey Lewis, Phil Collins, and Whitney Houston albums prior to murder and mayhem.  It then spiraled into the ground, leaving no survivors.  Imagine being forced to reread ""Hannibal.""  Among it's MANY weaknesses:<br/><br/>1.  Christian Bale's performance:  Contrary to most reviews, Christian Bale gives a completely predictable, unskilled performance.  Anthony Hopkins and Kathleen Turner have popularized the sangfroid of the urbane, sophisticated serial killer, but Bale doesn't even approach them.  There's nothing new here.  Instead of chilling imperturbability, we're given monotone and wood. Monotone and wood.  Monotone and wood.  Then, trying to shock us with contrast, his outbursts of violence look like they were choreographed by Chuck Jones of Warner Bros fame.  Beep beep.  Even his breakdown scene falls flat.  We're left with all the subtlety of his earlier Speilberg role without the final mercy of an American bombing run.<br/><br/>2.  Annoying voice-over:  I'm more forgiving of this technique than most, but the criticism is well deserved here.  It's a poor substitute for tight story and competent direction.  The main character's narcissism, the Wall Street milieu, his shallow and acquisitive colleagues, and his taste for insipid music should suffice to establish his soulless hollowness; there's no need for verbal cue cards.  I suspect it's just the director's attempt to cut through the tedium of the movie and try to legitimize the film by evoking the novel.<br/><br/>3.  Reese Witherspoon:  Knowing what she's capable of, I can only conclude that she was hobbled by a bad script and sophomoric direction.  Just a one-dimensional rehash of Madeline Kahn from Young Frankenstein and Gloria Upson from Auntie Mame. Talk about poo-poo undies.<br/><br/>4.  Running gags:  How many times does the audience have to see the same jokes about business card fonts and the inability to get dinner reservations?<br/><br/>5.  Dead-end plot devices:  A private eye played by Willem Defoe and a case of mistaken identity that go nowhere.  Was this bad editing or did the filmmaker forget herself.  ""Excuse me, I was looking for the set of 'Talented Mr Ripley'.""<br/><br/>6.  Direction and cinematography:  Makes ""Sliders"" look pretty slick.<br/><br/>7.  Derivative:  There was NOTHING in this film that was not already done in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Bright Lights, Big City,"" and ""Serial Mom.""  In short, I've seen this film years ago at least three times, which corresponds to the number of IMDB stars I'd give it."

"sean_36","5","1","3","10 December 2001"," disappointing
","British actor Christian Bale stars in the role (that Leonardo Dicaprio turned down) of Patrick Batemen, a wall street hot shot who has a nasty habit of killing people, and for no good reason. Based on the conraversal book by Bret Easton Ellis the film was adapted by director Mary Haron who went though lots of difficulties to get this film made.  So was it worth it ?  Not really.  I'm not saying American psycho's a bad movie, but it's not a good one either.  It's more like in the middle. Among problems are the casting, although Bale looks like a psycho he goes over the top with the acting.  I would never believe him as a real person never mind a complex killer, which brings me to the second problem.  He wasn't complex enough! If you compare him with other crazies like Jack Nicholson in The Shining or Malcom McDowell in A Clockwork Orange you could see what they were going through which made it frightening because they seemed so real and believable.  Then there's the other problem of the pointless subplot with Willam Dafoe as a investigator, which didn't seem to go anywhere.  It has it's creepy moments though, like in a scene where Batemen works out while listening to the Texas Chainsaw Massacar or when he chases a women through an apartment wearing nothing but a chainsaw.  Maybe the film would have been better if it focused more on his mind and less on his crimes."

The business card stuff was great.  There are plenty of others as well that show good humor and sharp wit.<br/><br/>Also, the 80s timeframe set for this movie was a good choice for the strange clique that Bale's character keeps.  His interaction with his friends is great.  The notion of this unstable psychopath milling about (and strangely fitting in with) these stiff businessmen with their rigid routine is pretty original.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for American Psycho, these weren't enough.  They added some nice spice to the film, but man cannot enjoy basil alone.  Watching this movie is like eating bread dough with some rosemary on top.  You can detect some interesting stuff in there, but it's bland for the most part.  Most of the time spent watching this movie I was glancing at my watch seeing how much longer I had left to wait till it was done.<br/><br/>Baseline is that American Psycho has some good parts, but you have to sit through the rest of the movie to get to them.

","This had all the ingredients of being a good film - sadly, it turned out to be anything but. I'm sure you'll hear this a lot, but this is genuinely one occasion where you'd be mad not to take my advice to read the book that this film is based on instead. <br/><br/>The film changes the book to suit its purpose and Bateman, the wall-street yuppie and psycho of the title, is turned from an engaging character deep in existential angst into nothing more than a comic-book killer. The idea behind the book was that in spite of his detestable behaviour, the reader is forced to engage with more with Bateman than his shallow friends. In the film, Bateman's actions and psychology is never explained, leaving a sub-par slasher flick laced with heavy handed satire about the supposed greed of the late 80s.<br/><br/>That isn't to say the film doesn't have its good parts. Christian Bale is extremely convincing as Bateman, and it's only a shame that he was working to a poor script and poor direction at the hands of feminist director Mary Harron, who emasculates the book and turns it into a feminist critique of male mysogynism. Major yawn. To exemplify, in the film, it is a subject of some argument whether the murders are all in Bateman's head, but in the book the murders are very vivid and very real.<br/><br/>However, the sets are excellent (if a little too modern for a period piece) and there are some great moments of comedy which shine through the heavy-handed adaptation, and it's worth watching for these reasons alone. Legend has it that Bret Easton Ellis wrote a screenplay for this film himself, but it was rejected. The only question is - why? He was the only person who could have done this film justice.<br/><br/>This film is a hit and miss -- but mostly miss."

Christian Bale plays a good Bateman, but he should have been portrayed as taller, more brutal, powerful and on the edge!<br/><br/>2. It should have started with a look back at the eighties, and not just take it for granted that the audience knows. Bateman should have entered the movie later, and on a time that we were not expecting it.<br/><br/>3. Bale is more than ok when it comes to Batemans coldness and numness. On the other hand you never see a glimpse of Patricks insanity: that crazy look that tells you he`s gonna eat his victims brain for dinner, or stick a knife through someones eye really slowly.<br/><br/>4. In the book you get a much greater sense of how Bateman treats other people as thin air. In the movie it seems like he actually care sometimes.<br/><br/>And most important:<br/><br/>5. It`s totally impossible to make a movie of this book and not let the audience see any terror, fright, physical and not least the mental hell Batemans victims go through. All you can see is a few corpses hanging in a closet, when he kicks a dog and shoots a few people. This is not Patrick Bateman from the book, it`s a regular thriller movie about a man gone bad. Not a man gone monster.<br/><br/>I understand that the film has gotten many good rewievs becouse of this. I could not disagree more. The fact that kids (15 year olds) are allowed to see it in Norway tells a lot...<br/><br/>I hope one day another director with a vision to realise Patrick Bateman comes along.<br/><br/>Untill then, I prefer the book."

","Let's start with the good since this movie has far little good to say about it. <br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is a big firm Wall Street guy who has his own personal assistant, lives in a luxury apartment in New York City, and hangs around the snobbiest douche bags you can imagine in the world of big financial firms. The typical cocaine and fancy restaurants crew who have tons of misogynistic bullshit to throw around and treat each other like some Harvard/Yale fraternity, which by no surprise, Bateman mentions he has an MBA from Harvard. <br/><br/>Christian Bale is a great actor.. His acting as Patrick Bateman, who we find pretty early on in the movie is a psychopath (Surprise, surprise!) with a fetish for killing hookers and prostitutes, is very believably and spot on. Kudos to him for his acting in this movie.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk the bad. <br/><br/>This movie has no plot, no real story, and no viable message at the end of it. Some bad sex scenes, a Jared Leto cameo (his part is very minute), a good amount of gore and an ending that is completely absurd, that spoiling it would actually be doing you a favor, as it might save you from watching this terrible movie sums up the entire movie, if you include the introduction I gave you about Patrick Bateman. <br/><br/>Now let's add a few more details because you're probably still curious enough to watch it.. In the firm he works for, people barely know Patrick Bateman. A few of his cohorts confuse him for other persons, calling him by the wrong name and the typical big firm kinda crap you see in movies. What makes Bateman different? He's OCD, obsessed with his image and taking care of his body and face (which they do just an okay job of showing with one scene), enjoys Phil Collins and likes to banter about seemingly irrelevant facts to make himself look like a pop culture connoisseur right before he murders his hooker victims.<br/><br/>Sadly, that last description probably makes you more interested in watching it than not.. Let me save you the time by letting you know that, they do not in any way shape or form portray why Mr. Bateman becomes the way he is.. He simply just ""IS"". this way in the movie. <br/><br/>If you really try to dig deep into this movie and try to shovel a message out of this pile of crap, you might be left with this: It seems the movie tries to suggest at the end that all the people around him in his career field are also pretty much psychopaths in their own way.. Snobby, fancy suit and designer wearing, cocaine and Chardonnay, obsessed with booking dinners at fancy restaurants, aroused by having the most fancy business card out of their colleagues (actually possibly the only interesting scene in this movie was the card scene), having apartments that overlay Central Park, and ragging each other about their Ivy league schools with a handful of homosexual jokes, almost oblivious to the world below them..But besides that, there's also a suggestion of no one really knowing who he is because he, himself, does not know who he is.. Even his lawyer at the end calls him by a different name, and doesn't realize he's Bateman. <br/><br/>But let's not get carried away, since the message is not clear and there is no plot to this movie. Nothing ever reaches a climax or height.. More like a rampant buildup, then a frenzy, before a dull haze and then boom it's over. This movie lacks anything clever or meaningful whatsoever. It's just a sex, blood, hooker movie with Christian Bale's great acting and amazingly impressive physique. More work went into that physique than went into any directing, production or writing of this movie, for sure. <br/><br/>VERDICT: If you value your time, skip this movie as there is only one or two scenes that are ""good movie"" material.. If that."

She does a very good job of adapting the controversial novel of the same name.<br/><br/>Christian Bale stars as a reserved rich kid who's has a do nothing job in his father's company. He spends his days doodling and hanging with his co-workers. His nights are spent expressing his unusual dark side. Just how whacked and crazy does he get? That would be too telling. Trust me, pick up a copy of American PSYCHO, you wont be disappointed. I guarantee it! Co-stars Reese Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, Jared Leto and co-writer Guinevere Turner.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","This movie is an inside joke in my family about the ultimate in cheesy badness. Bale is pretty to look at, this the biggest compliment I can offer American Psycho. If you aren't offended by graphic violence the movie really shouldn't bug you, but I and everyone who watched it with me found this movie very flawed. By about half way through the movie, I was just shaking my head and quite honestly don't know what kept me watching it, other than Christian Bales beautiful form. The movie is well acted and there are some suspenseful moments, unfortunately the story could have been presented in a much more engrossing manner and with fewer gaping holes. Throughout the film I found myself shaking my head and rolling my eyes."

","I give every film adaptation from Bret Easton Ellis at least one chance because so far, I haven't liked a single movie. I don't get this man. First of all, the cast of characters are all WASPs in each book/film- as if the world is devoid of anyone non-caucasian. It's unrealistic and a tad racist, don'tcha think? The only non-caucasians are a homeless man (""Psycho"") and a coked-up drug dealer Rupert (""Rules of Attraction""). Those seem to also be some negative stereotyping. But then again, ALL stereotyping is a tad negative.<br/><br/>To me, the film was dreck. I'm surprised it outgrossed its budget for the short lived time it was theatrically released. The movie was boring, and I just didn't identify with Patrick Bateman. Perhaps if I were affluent and living on the East Coast I'd think differently. That seems to be the norm to Easton's characters. What was up with every chick (except the prostitute) all having blonde hair? They were all starting to look the same to me: Reese Witherspoon/Chloe Sevigny/Samantha Manthis/Jared Leto...<br/><br/>The only thing this movie had going for it was the production design and the cinematography. No doubt- I thought I was watching outtakes of ""Bright Lights, Big City"". I give the DP major props for the job. Funny how Christian Bale was about 10 when this film was supposed to take place. But after the Willem Dafoe scene, there was no suspense, and the movie just kind of shot itself. So the ending wasn't suspenseful at all. You just sat there and thought, ""I sat through two hours of THAT?"" I'm glad to see that this film was able to garner a straight-to-video, ""American Psycho 2"" and ""...3"". If only the first one did and disappear like a fart in the wind.<br/><br/>I'm done."

I heard one guy on the way out shout, ""This sucks!!! I'm getting a refund!"" That was funny.<br/><br/>The movie, to me, seemed really awkward.  In certain areas it was hard to keep from laughing, so I cut loose and found the rest of the audience start to laugh.<br/><br/>The script, however, did bring up interesting social pressures that high powered office holding men go through.<br/><br/>peace out I gave it a 2, but that is my opinion you might find otherwise."

I defy anyone who has seen this to name me one.<br/><br/>The women are all pretty and dumb.  Samantha, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon are given nothing to do.  Willem Dafoe, one of the world's smartest actors, plays a private investigator who is presented with dozens of clues to Patrick Bateman's guilt, and he acts upon none of them.  If he were a real PI, he'd be starving due to his lack of skill at his profession.<br/><br/>The ending is likewise anticlimactic and bad.  This is a professionally shot and well-acted film, I'll give it that.  Christian Bale gives a very good performance.  But why do we need to see this person's life ?

"jboothmillard","8","3","23","15 June 2005"," American Psycho
","Based on the popular novel by Bret Easton Ellis, this is a great satirical black comedy horror drama, from (female!) writer/director Mary Harron. Basically Patrick Bateman (a brilliant Christian Bale, with a convincing American accent) is a successful, wealthy twenty-seven-year-old Wall Street businessman with quite a good reputation, and he takes good care of himself to maintain good looks and health. No-one would suspect that he was a psychotic serial killer, but after viciously killing an innocent tramp and his dog, and then the annoying workmate, you know it. As the film continues, local cop Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is questioning Patrick for a reliable alibi, while Patrick is having ""fun"" with prostitutes (that he first whips, and later kills), watching pornography, and being irritated by his apparent fiancée Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon). Also starring Super Mario Bros. star Samantha Mathis as Courtney Rawlinson, Chloë Sevigny as Jean, Mulholland Drive's Justin Theroux as Timothy Bryce, Josh Lucas as Craig McDermott and Guinevere Turner as Elizabeth. The memorable moments for me are Patrick explaining his routine for good living (including the poster picture of him wearing the blue ice pack mask on his eyes), the sleazy threesome, the human head in the fridge, Patrick running naked through the corridors with a chainsaw to kill the whore, and the murder of Paul Allen (Jared Leto) while talking about music (his passion). The dialogue is very witty, the violence is really cool, and Bale has never been better. The ending, after his breakdown and confession of his horrific crimes, is a bit weird, you see the words ""This is not an exit"" on the wall, and you don't know if it is his imagination, or an insignificance to other characters, but apart from this weird ending, the rest is a must see. Very good!"

","I watched this movie, seeing its good reviews; in hopes of having: 1. a good movie villain who I could root for 2. a good hero, whom I could also root for and 3. a good story line......I got none of them. I only watched about 1/2 this movie before I shut it off because I was falling asleep. Patrick Bateman is such an idiot, he tries to be all sophisticated yet evil at the same time, but he fails miserably. He's trying to copy Hannibal Lecter but sucking at it. You could tell from the start that he's evil, he says it about 50 times. And he always says ""Im gonna kill you"". Thats really subtle. He does NOT have the style of killing that Hannibal Lecter does either, Lecter kills people in unique, interesting, and sneaky ways. Bateman does it so blatantly. His first victim is a homeless guy and his dog. He sits there and taunts a homeless guy, then stabs him. Then his dog barks at him so he stomps the poor thing to death. What kind of wuss is he? Can he not fight someone face-to-face? His second victim is a co-worker. But, he gets him drunk first. Then covers the furniture and carpet of his house and invites him over. They talk for 10 minutes then he hits him while off guard with an axe. I could tell for 10 minutes that he was going to kill him, hes not sneaky at all. Then...I guess I dozed off. And he describes himself as some kinda super villain. Hes pathetic!"

","This movie had all the potential of being a quality suspense/psychological thriller. Unfortunately it tries too hard, relies on a horrible script and leave the viewer feeling numb and asking himself why did I just waste almost two hours on this. The main actor (Bale) does about a good a job as possible with the material given to him while the surrounding cast add absolutely nothing to the film. At first, the movie was strange enough, but interesting enough to make me feel like it was some strange blend of Fight Club meets Clockwork Orange, but this film lacked any depth so the morbidity of the scenes just leave you feeling ill for no purpose. The sets weren't all that great, the little things that set the main actor off were just stupid, and their commentary on upscale, snobbish life in New York in the 1980's was at first interesting, but then mind-bogglingly exaggerated and idiotic. If anything, one might get this for the gore and horror effect, but alas it falls short in that area as well as the movie has only a sprinkle of blood and wouldn't scare a 5 year old. Do not rent this movie unless you like sloppily-done films with no actors and a plot about as meaningless as a traffic cop."

","American Psycho was an intense novel. However, the film adaption is poorly done on many levels. For one, Christian Bale despite having the right build and look for the character is not very believable as a psycho. His over-acting makes him look silly and not in the least bit scary or even intimidating. Not to mention the very selective approach to the sequencing of the film in comparison to the novel and the limited character development. Go to your local book store and pick up the novel but definitely pass on the movie."

"writ74","2","1","5","19 September 2000"," Paced excruciatingly slow, American Psycho fails on all levels
","When I read this book in the mid-eighties, one of the most interesting aspects of it was its listing of the items that seemed to intrigue the consumerism aspects of the yuppie's soul.  Sure the book was horrificly violent as it followed Patrick Bateman on his random acts of homicidal violence, but it was a quick read--thought provoking, disturbing and over soon.  Many hated the literary qualities of the book as the prose was based on a shopping list quality that I thought made the book even more intriguing.  The movie starts off interesting as Bateman, played by Christian Bale, who should win an Oscar for overacting, tells the viewer of his facial cleansing regime and I'm thinking this is going to be pretty good.  But that's where the fun ends and the movie begins simply following Bateman from one grisly incident to another.  Problem with this is these scenes are not interesting.  They show us nothing about the soul of Bateman and seem intended as nothing more than shock value.  The premise of the book which was the utter shallowness of yuppie consumerism has been lost.<br/><br/>Not only is the film painfully slow, it is dull to the point that I was glancing at the clock every ten minutes.  I soon realized that director Mary Harron's film is not an interesting piece about one man's utter descent into madness, glazed over with his yuppie pretensions, but a film about a killer that offers the viewer nothing more than your average slasher film.  At least your average slasher film has some suspense where Harron's film has none of that.  AMERICAN PSYCHO could have been a great movie, but obviously it got into the wrong hands and ends of being a cold passionless story about a man that stirs absolutely no emotions in the viewer."

","There was so much hype around this film that it was hard to go into it without any preconceptions.  I tried to read the book ages ago but was bored stiff by the descriptions of what Patrick Bateman wore and all his expensive doo-dad's.  <br/><br/>When I heard that the movie was going to be done very tongue in cheek I was pretty apprehensive about it - that could go so so wrong.  In actual fact it did not go all that wrong.  It was not funny (at least not to me) especially in the way I thought it would be done and the way it was portrayed in the teasers.  I expected it to be cartoonish and it was not.  But I also expected it to be disturbing to some degree and it was not.  I find the fact that it was not disturbing very disturbing.  This is a story of a sociopathic serial killer - who kills many people and kills them fairly graphically on screen.  And yet it was not all that disturbing..  I guess that says something about me..  I was bored and just wanted the movie to be over.  I guess some of the book really did creep through to the film."

Also, I was unsure of whether or not the main character was actually killing people or just imagining it. His name is Patrick Bateman - probably - but some doubt is supposed to be planted about that as well. But his secretary calls him by that name and other people seem to recognize him. He travels a New York City oddly devoid of people. At the end of the day, even as a psycho he is not that interesting, nor is anyone else in the film."

","I did not understand the concept of the movie at all. It did not have a beginning nor an end, which many would see at a positive angel. There are many great movies without any beginnings or ends but this one was not one of them. <br/><br/>The unique mind of Pat Bateman fills you with such wonders and awe that in some way that awe whitewashes the entire movie altogether. You get drawn into his world and I for one did not understand it which was the negative part of the movie. You were never informed of almost anything, the only reason you were there for was to observe, listen to what he had to say and that was it. A lot of scenes and plots in that movie were left in confusion or unanswered and after a while I realized they tended to keep it that way. <br/><br/>What I did like was the acting of Christian Bale. So drawn into his character I sometimes forgot he also is the savior of Gotham. Maybe I'm at fault for comparing two completely different characters, but that is what got through my mind as I observed Bateman. Instead of making a character out of a movie Christian Bale made a movie out of Batemans character. In my opinion he raised the movie into a whole new level. A level that made me feel confused about this movie. Was the movie good or bad? <br/><br/>One other thing leaving me a bit frustrated was the fact that the movie seemed to try being more than it was. The content weighed too much for the movie to be able to perform good and that kind of ruined the whole thing. Something THAT new like a whole new mind, thinking and world such as Batemans would've been something so good to work with if they hadn't rushed things too much. They tried to put it all into 102 minutes when we just had adapted ourselves into his way of thinking. If I had created this mind I would've at least had several movies about this or a series, because something like this, in my opinion, takes time. We didn't learn everything about the vampire, a whole new creature, with just one or two movies did we?"

","In the late 1980s, twenty-seven-year-old Patrick Bateman-a shallow, narcissistic, and affluent businessman who works in mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street-lives the indulgent high life, and feels the need to fit in...but he also has a dark secret: he's an impulsive, psychopathic murderer who despite having all the characteristics of a human being, finds it increasingly difficult to control his nightly bloodlust. To watch this film is like seeing a natural disaster unfold right before your eyes; part psychological horror film, part dark comedy, part satirical thriller and character study with a vicious barrage of overkill, this surreal, uneven blend is not for the faint of heart, yet it's well-cast and very interesting, spotlights some memorable 80s tunes, and is carried a long way by Bale's devastating, undaunted performance.

Love this film, I wish the ending was a bit more conclusive as I like closure. An open ending that makes you think can work, and this is probably an example of one. But still I would of preferred a definite ending.

","I was really excited for this film to see the very positive reviews from my favorite critics. However, to my dismay, this film was merely a two and a half hour of nothing but violence.
I have nothing against violence; my second favorite film of all time is A Clockwork Orange. However, in A Clockwork Orange, there was an interesting story to follow and the violence was a plot device used by the director in order to truly make the scene as dramatic as possible. But if violence is all you have to offer then the film would have nothing to entertain
The main character is a man named Patrick Bateman who is played by Christian Bale who gives an outstanding performance. The character himself is quite interesting and has some great dialog. I love how in ever since he gives off a feeling of depressed haterade, and as a result, it gives a suspenseful tension where he could just lose it all.
But sadly the conflicts that follow that the character most goes from are doll and reprieve for we see time and time again a pointless violence murder committed by the main character that serves not to further the story but merely to show since that are pleasing to the eye with the great cinematography but this may never rid of the feeling of your time being wasted. There was a single interesting premise that suggested that the whole thing was in his head. However, this is in the last 20 minutes of this two and a half har film. I would for preferred that they payed more time and attention for this plotline rather than show pointless murders over and over.
I have heard in an interview were the author of the novel defended those arguments of the film saying that it was supposed to be a dark comedy. Now as I have not read the novel I canot say if this is true or not. However, this film is ever clearly presented as a drama. And even If it was a comity I would need more than just senseless violence,<br/><br/>And that is why I give American Psycho a 5 out of 10"

Too bad the same was not true for the movie.<br/><br/>The voice over at the end even tells you that nothing happened, nothing changed. So why did we spend money to watch a movie where nothing changed? No idea! That's why it got a 5 from me. Right now, I am thinking it should be 4 but the cinematography was good. 1 point. Everything was in focus. +1 point. The sound was good +1 point. And the audio was good +1 point. So that gets us to 4. So why 5? Not sure. Maybe that it did not run overly long. It certainly was a combinations of several killer styles. Finding a gas powered chain saw in a modern, New York apartment was odd. And throwing it at someone about 50 feet away and hitting them was odd. It is a noisy affair. One could hear it coming and move enough to avoid it. Maybe that's some of that satire that someone mentioned. It was lost on me. It just looked stupid! Some of the characters were almost embarrassing to watch. Cringeworthy is a modern term for it. They made me nervous watching them. Maybe that was part of the effect the director intended. Keep the viewer on edge.

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","1","8 February 2017"," One of the best films in Christian Bale's career.
","This film is based on a book I never read and talks about the life of Patrick Bateman, a successful New York stockbroker who lives for appearances because of his exacerbated materialism. He loves appearances, personified on his perfect face, on his business card, in his home and ostentatious way of life. However, he feels that something is missing, and that he can not be complete with just that. Then he begins to kill and maim all those he can (prostitutes, beggars, people he hates) in order to extricate the contempt he feels for others and feel a more intense emotion. Thus, this film becomes a huge criticism of the world of appearances in which we live, and in which a monster only needs to look beautiful and successful to be well accepted by our society. However, its such an implicit criticism that many people focus on the crimes and ignored the philosophical reflection around the character. Christian Bale was huge in the lead role, and his strong and impressive acting is undoubtedly one of the main reasons to watch this movie. He is definitely to be congratulated, having made in this film one of the strongest roles in his career. The rest of the cast gives the actor a strong foundation for him to grow and shine. In spite of all this, it is a hard-to-watch movie, with very crude and violent images of murders and mutilations. Some consideration is needed before watching, which includes taking all the minors out of the room."
"suite92","5","0","1","12 September 2016"," Great visuals undone by script and direction as well as inconsistent sound capture and editing.
","The protagonist talks directly to the viewer. This is bovine scatology. The entire film is about a delusional protagonist, so nothing is to be trusted in the plot lines, such as they are. Just because some action is depicted on the screen does not mean that it happened outside the sour operations of this afflicted mind. One might as well be suffering through Walter Mitty, except that the lead has bloody fantasies instead of Mitty's pleasant ones.<br/><br/>So, since nothing of the exposition is to be trusted, what is the point of this vile mess?<br/><br/>As one navigates through this maze of false threads, that is the central question. The hideous ending casts everything even deeper in doubt. The film is reminiscent of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) which was heaped with praise since Terry Gilliam directed it. That does not change the fact that after watching the film, one wonders whether Depp's character did any of the actions shown on screen. In American Psycho, the disappointment was much stronger because the production values were so much higher. Whereas FLiLV looked sleazy, AP looked exquisite; interspersed with the shock segments, that is. I expected some sort of value for having suffered through the recurring horrific images, the type one expects from a slasher film or a mild gore-fest, but done by someone like Hitchcock.<br/><br/>If American Psycho is considered as a collage, bits of the film were good for witty conversation or for commentary on the 1980s and the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent. The collage as a whole, though, is just an incoherent collection of high quality materials badly assembled. <br/><br/>The last two minutes were almost interesting, but the rest of the film did not support the message. The effect as a whole is doubled: who cares? It is all delusion and of no point at all."

","I think the main issue I had was that most of the actors seem to have been directed to talk in a flat, monotone-like voice. I'm guessing this was done in order to make the characters show that they are cool and sophisticated...or at least to make other characters *think* they are such. Thing is, when you have to hear movie characters talking this way for most of a movie's running time, it becomes boring itself after a while. Or so I found.<br/><br/>Then there were at least two contradictory moments. The main character is supposed to be a hygiene freak, yet he seems to have no problem 1: having sex in his work clothes; then 2: hitching up his pants up without showing the slightest interest in cleaning his private parts. Really? Later on, after having made it clear what a clean freak he is, he flicks a cigarette ash on the floor of his office. Really??<br/><br/>These may seem like trivial moments to some, but I found them distracting.<br/><br/>What did I like about the movie? Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon and Willem Dafoe.

"Angelika_New_York","6","0","1","20 April 2016"," American Psycho (2000) Movie and book review.
","I honestly didn't know it was based on a book prior to the release of the film. Sometime in the fall of '99, I thought the brief trailer for it looked intriguing. Seeing it in the theatres however, I've been on the fence about it ever since. This is a middle-of-the- road movie for me. Adequate would be an accurate word to describe it. There isn't anything really extraordinary about it. There's nothing really to hold onto after it ends. <br/><br/>Now being familiar with Bret Easton Ellis' material, I consider the novel to be basically on par with his two previous works: Less Than Zero and The Rules of Attraction, respectively. Apathy runs rampant within his characters. He certainly has a wild imagination. He explicitly details some of the most graphic sex I have ever read. For some strange reason, the further the lead character slips away from reality, the funnier it gets. It somewhat makes it captivating on a certain level because of its absurdity, but it becomes more inconceivable as it goes on. The best way I can describe it is as a dark comedy. I have wondered that it could ultimately, in a roundabout way, be a book about mental illness, but it does not change how silly it can get. His writing is sufficient, but he kind of writes interesting trash. How he writes his subjects isn't bad by any stretch. I feel it helps his material; sort of like writing a trashy article, as ridiculous as it may be, it cannot be helped but to read further. However, I have come to the conclusion that it is one of the dumbest books I have ever read. It's easy for me to read a book, which a film is based on without the influence. I kind of picture Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman. Ultimately though, just as the rest of the characters, I picture nondescript people; basically average looking; nothing remarkably charismatic about them, including the main character. Sort of imagining the casting of a Whit Stillman movie. To me, Bateman is someone basically blending into a background, but he's front and center in this story. His colleague Timothy Price who is his best friend seemingly, is quite arrogant; probably equally as Patrick Bateman if not more. At one point early on in the book, Bateman mentions that Price is the most interesting person he knows, which adds to how incredible this book is. The second chapter consists of the detailed description of Bateman's apartment and him getting ready for work. That's it. There is even a chapter that is strictly about the musical career of the band Genesis all through the eighties. I continue on because of how astounding it is; even reading it out of order doesn't hinder its overall effect. <br/><br/>To me, Bateman comes across as a trendy character. He wants to fit in and keep up with all of the latest fashion and gadgets. He even goes into this whole diatribe about making America great and supporting civil rights and equal rights; pretty much saying what an ideal democrat candidate would say, yet he's thinking about murdering animals and peoplewell, thinking about it at least. None of it is proved just as the movie. In the end, his lawyer doesn't believe what he confesses. So I just think that it's what he thinks about constantly. He is also quite an unreliable narrator. There is usually someone mistaken for someone else. Essentially everyone looks like everyone else in the Wall Street yuppie world. Later when the investigation occurs, it could be for some other matter. Who knows. Who cares.<br/><br/>So, my grade is a C+"

For me, this movie is truly a work of art..<br/><br/>PS: The initial scene in question for the following conclusion is the fact that nobody seems to recognize Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) no matter the setting, this occurs in scattered moments throughout the movie, but the topic of discussion is the fact that Harold (Batemans lawyer) doesn't - even after Patrick Bateman clearly testifies to committing all of the murders in the movie, over the telephone.<br/><br/>:The Idea:<br/><br/>""""Patrick Bateman does not exist physically but rather is the narrative occupying the minds of all the characters we see and this is eluded to numerous times. The opening dialog itself states ""I simply am not there"" which was timed so it's said when he peels off the mask. The entire dialog once the mask has dried eludes to his lack of physical existence and being the ""spirit"" that occupies all of these people. He's talking about the emptiness inside these people he represents and the elitist vanities they use to try to fill them and justify their despicable personalities. The Bateman is used as a scapegoat or mirror image, but he simply doesn't exist physically. When his secretary says ""thanks Patrick"" he says ""I'm not here"".<br/><br/>Even the friends of Bateman humiliate him and in the beginning they don't even know which man is Paul Allen. When we see this person, whoever he is, he is drinking himself into an early grave.<br/><br/>Notice the head is there as a projection? It could actually be anybody sitting there but it's The Bateman driving him to sleep with his coworker's fiancé. The spirit of The Bateman.<br/><br/>Bateman telling people what to do, what he thinks, the standards he sets etc. is the inner voice driving all of these people and sometimes it's internal and other times it's external but we see him as Davis who really exists or Allen who really exists when they are all being The Bateman. <br/><br/>Get it? <br/><br/>He is the manifestation of consumerism, materialism, capitalism, the greed and lust of the supercharged society they all live in. You notice in conversations everyone centers around him, praises him, seek his approval?<br/><br/>Every emotion he describes is a reflection of every character in the movie right down to the murders but they leave out the ""if I could get away with it"". There's copious amounts of evidence validating what I'm saying. There's at least one example in every scene that verifies what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Not only is there no Patrick Bateman but the physical character we are following doesn't exist. If however, you watch it a few times in a row you can see Patrick Bateman's physical existence represents many things not just thoughts or actual people. Sometimes someone shows up and we see an opportunity to accept this theory as the Bateman unleashed was in fact Victoria's inner Bateman. We are seeing The Bateman inside of everyone. We are watching a movie about all the secondary characters who are in fact the leads but only when they are being The Bateman.<br/><br/>Of course the one last concept is indeed Bateman exists as a Phantom and passes from body to body.<br/><br/>It's as close to art as film making can ever get and one of the few films out of hundreds of thousands that deserves to be called art.""""<br/><br/>I hope this fascinated some of you.."

"luke-a-mcgowan","10","0","1","4 February 2016"," A masterpiece for Mary Herron and Christian Bale
","There aren't many movies this bizarre that I would consider masterpieces, but Mary Herron's American Psycho (yes, a woman directed this!) deserves no lesser title. <br/><br/>It would be disrespectful to the hugely talented women behind the camera to say that the film is all about Christian Bale, but he deserves a huge amount of its praise. Bateman is a flat-out psychopath but never feels overacted. Bale is completely at home in Bateman's skin, whether he is displaying gross levels of narcissism, ranting like a maniac or just walking around bearing a grim scowl. The accent that Bale chooses for Bateman is inspired; generic and mellow yet bubbling with madness. The way a smile slides straight from Bateman's face conveys that he does indeed only feel disgust and greed. He's wildly funny and yet greatly horrifying. The perfect anti-hero.<br/><br/>American Psycho is so much more than a well-acted black comedy, and that is thanks to the incredible direction of Mary Herron (who has done nothing of note since and has so much to offer!) along with the script she co-wrote with Guinevere Taylor adapted from the Bret Easton Ellis book. American Psycho is a commentary on corporate America, where everyone is the same and no one stands out but everyone seems to think that they do. This is best seen in the business card scene, as well as a less famous and openly funny scene in which men are all doing cocaine in the toilet cubicles and yet shouting at each other for bothering their private business. Characters note slight differences from each other that are not objectively apparent to audience members whilst flat out ignoring similarities. Bateman's instructions to really listen to the music ""It's Hip to Be Square"" are just as much for the audience - the world says that it is great to be uninteresting and fit in.<br/><br/>The script adds more layers in commentary on what rich people are like. Devilishly scripted scenes such as corporate idiots trying to sound smart talking about world issues - ""don't you know about Sri Lanka? The Sikhs are killing like a tonne of Israelis over there"" - are as much a commentary as that listed above. Bateman and the other corporates are constantly trying to impress people with their connections, ability to book last minute restaurants, and social status. The casting of Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's glamorous fiancé whom he utterly despises contributes perfectly to this aspect of the film, a stark contrast to the unglamorous Chloe Sevigny and Cara Seymour.<br/><br/>Many can get through the first viewing of American Psycho and be pleasantly entertained by wacky and hilarious moments. But the loose grip on reality is what might turn some off. The last 20 minutes is almost impossible to follow unless you have decided on an interpretation. I interpret the film as being fantasies in Bateman's head, all the murders simply being doodles on his compendium (as he is never seen actually doing work). Mary Herron's brilliant direction never favours one interpretation over the other, rather she shades the film from every angle (see the splicing of Willem Dafoe's suspicious scenes with his friendly scenes, representing Bateman's lack of connection to reality).<br/><br/>American Psycho is sheer brilliance. It is daring and not enough film are like this. A wildly funny what-is-happening black comedy on the surface, Psycho has so many layers and mysteries that it not only warrants repeat viewings, it deserves them."

There is a spoiler disclaimer at the top, but I must clarify that there are some fair sized spoilers further on in this review.<br/><br/>I'll start with the humor. For some, it's difficult to see humor in a movie so intensely dark and grotesque. However, I'd say that killing someone with an ax to the tune of ""Huey Lewis and the News"" is fantastic. What makes it even funnier is the fact that it was all over a business card. <br/><br/>Next, the psychology. I'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers, and this is no disappointment in that category. We slowly see the lead character slip into insanity, and catch a glimpse of what's going on in his head. <br/><br/>That brings me to the next point, the main character himself, Patrick Bateman. The charming sociopath may seem like a hackneyed character, but this sort of character was unique. He's rarely friendly, cold, but somehow cunning and able to be a serial killer when he's not eating at Dorsia.<br/><br/>The ending is a major plot twist to say the least.

"cetuh","9","0","1","30 October 2015"," American Psycho is a movie with a twist.
","The movie ""American Psycho"" is a manic tale of a businessman who is trying to further himself in his position. Patrick Bateman, The American Psycho, is a man who is seemingly descending further into madness. As the story progresses, Patrick progressively commits acts of murder and other heinous acts as he slowly kills more and more prominent figures, from a distraught and suffering homeless man to a fellow business partner that would obviously be noticed if they went missing. His madness intensifies to the point that he went on a psychotic rampage, even to the point of trying to shove a cat into a ATM machine. The characters in the movie besides the main character all show the consistent greed and selfish attitude that's common for the businessmen Patrick was surrounded by. Patrick was shown to not fit in as well, joking about grotesque things that unsettled most people or just talking about murder lightly. Patrick Bateman was shown to have a blatant disregard for the feelings and opinions of others in matters he felt he knew best which happened to be most things, even going as far as murdering some for their ignorance. The movie shows an intense spiral into madness but also an interesting side to the movie when at the end of the movie ,it shows that he might have just imagined the events of the movie or perhaps fantasized them when the coworker he killed in his apartment with an axe was shown to be alive and coming back from a business trip. This twist and how it's presented leaves me with the feeling that this movie deserves a 9/10. My only few gripes with the movie is that it doesn't show his coworker alive again to solidify his existence or survival.

","A social satire on the materialistic, self-obsessed & greed-driven upper society of the 1980s America which also mocks male narcissism, American Psycho presents a community made up of people who have all the luxury that money can buy yet no individuality of their own, a world where everyone looks, dresses & acts exactly the same and measure themselves only by their external appearances & material possessions.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman; a wealthy, narcissistic & material-obsessed investment banker living in New York during the late 1980s who's a stereotype of the yuppie generation & leads a secret life as a serial killer. But the mask of outer perfection he's put up so well to hide his psychopathic persona from his co-workers & friends begins to slip when he delves deeper into his darker fantasies.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Mary Harron, American Psycho is a captivating study of a madman who simultaneously obsesses & criticises the shallow culture he's a part of and attempts to hide his chaotic personal life through excessive vanity & beautification. Harron's direction is good for she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction & reality and although the ambiguity is maintained for the most part, it inadvertently falls apart in the final act.<br/><br/>The screenplay is no slouch for the story maintains its stringent focus on its lead character, who is present in every scene of the movie. Everything is told from Bateman's perspective and it is through his decadent lifestyle that the writers are critiquing the hedonistic society he simply happens to be a byproduct of. The script also showcases a fine balance between the elements of comedy & horror and there are moments which will be disturbing to few but hilarious to others for the exact same reason.<br/><br/>Production design team does a stellar job with extravagant-looking set pieces that suit the environment this film tries to establish. Cinematography is much dependent on which side of Bateman we are witnessing for the camera exhibits calm, controlled movements when he appears normal and turns chaotic whenever he reveals his true face. Editing steadily paces the whole story and sustains the ambiguous nature of the unfolding events to some extent. Lastly, the soundtrack cleverly puts together some existing songs that ties into its events.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, American Psycho features an excellent cast in Christian Bale, Chloë Sevigny, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon & others, and all of them are thoroughly convincing in their given roles. Bale however takes it to another level with a truly committed act that finds the actor transforming his body to match the physical aspects of his character and then diving into the psyche of a psychopath. He's also responsible for the humour that forms an integral part of the story and while he's well supported by the rest of the cast, this is his show all the way.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, American Psycho is an intriguing blend of comedy & horror that rides high on Christian Bale's knockout performance which ultimately brushes away many of its shortcomings. The equivocal aspect of this tale is almost destroyed by its poorly executed final act and is destined to compel most viewers to incline towards a simpler interpretation. But if one takes into account the mistaken identity theme, which is consistently addressed throughout the movie, then its satirisation of the 1980s yuppie-greed culture gains an even greater depth. Although its impact lessens on every subsequent viewing, American Psycho nevertheless deserves a watch or two for Bale's swashbuckling inputs alone. Don't miss it."

","American Psycho stars a Brit and is filmed largely in Toronto with much of the music provided by Englishmen (exclude for Huey Lewis who's golden retriever countenance and cheerfulness couldn't be much more American). Title aside the film based on the overrated novel plays out the idle fantasies of an unseen office-dwelling narrator named Patrick Bateman who imagines himself really, really, really, really, ridiculously good looking (as Derek Zoolander might say), wealthy without actually having to do any work, and with his greatest challenge securing reservations at popular NYC restaurants of the time. He also fantasizes about extreme sex and violence scenarios recording them in a notebook in his office. The book and movie try to leave this ambiguous mistaking having a definite ending for cleverness. Of course, others have their own interpretation of events but ultimately the movie is not sufficiently interesting to argue about. While it does handily provide an critique of 80's yuppie culture, that wealthy entitled lifestyle has always existed in prosperous Western cultures; in the 80's it just had a name. In short, for as much ink and outrage spilled about the film, you would think it would actually be more thought-provoking."

","Dark, funny, clever and mind-bending. American Psycho shifts between the first and third person perspective of Patrick Bateman's yuppie-defined life. Our introduction to Patrick Bateman gives us a perfect insight into his life and mindset. We can tell how he has a healthy lifestyle, is wealthy and takes care of his skin. Yet we are also given the impression that he is callous and simply 'not there'. From killing women to comparing business cards, this movie doesn't fail to surprise. By the end of the film, you are left questioning whether any of Patrick Bateman's endeavours actually occur or if it was all just in his imagination. It is up put to the viewer to decide. A dark-comedy classic novel, told brilliantly 10/10."

Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner are faithful to the book's concept but are forced to go their own way with the story's structure, and they do it as good as anyone possibly could with such a unique novel; and Christian Bale will forever have props for bringing Bateman to life so perfectly, a character that could've easily have been mis-portrayed.

"dhaufrect-1","8","0","1","6 May 2015"," ""American Psycho"" is a thrilling thriller.
","American Psycho"" is a thrilling film currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. It is directed by Mary Harron. And it is written by Bret Easton Ellis with the screenplay by Mary Harron. Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people."" It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time. In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone (""I just had to kill a lot of people!"") or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' ""Fore"" album before hitting an associate over the head with an ax. Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal – he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster – complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, ""American Psycho"" is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era – sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong – and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, ""American Psycho"" hits strong and hard – this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle – it never was. The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and ""Hip to Be Square""; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein. Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role. Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co- starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home – he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre."

","American Psycho (2000): Dir: Mary Harron / Cast: Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon: Extremely violent film about man's detachment from reality. Intriguing shocker with brilliant technical value starring Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman peeling off a face mask to reveal the new him. He identifies himself through business cards while pulling away from humanity. He ignores his fiancé, disregards his secretary, and his apartment is strewn with bodies. Director Mary Harron is stylish particularly during a sequence where Bateman pursues a prostitute through corridors while hoisting a chainsaw. Confusing at times yet observant character study. Bale struggles to maintain his sanity as everyday life eludes him and grim images become a difficult battle of reality and fantasy until we are unsure his future. Willem Dafoe plays a cop investigating a disappearance and he hints too close to the facts during questioning. Chloe Sevigny plays his insecure secretary who faces his crass behaviour yet open to a date where she is unknowingly spared until she views his thoughts upon a sketch pad.

","American Psycho is a lot of different things...80's period piece, satire and social commentary. There also has a heavy dose of black comedy, along with horror and brutality. Combining the various elements work well as the team of writer Guinevere Turner and writer/director Mary Harron laid the groundwork for a very good film. Without being preachy, Harron has a lot to say about the yuppies and many of the social problems that existed in the 1980's. Christian Bale did an excellent job as a NYC executive that does his best to fit in and has terrible taste in music. He also is an amoral psychopath and brutal serial killer. To tell the truth, if all I had to lisen to Huey Lewis and Whitney Houston eventually I would go crazy as well and leave a stack of corpses behind me for sure. American Psycho is a great film that works on many levels and shows the dark side to yuppie culture that was huge in the 80's. There is a lot of truth in this film and is well performed and structured."

","My-oh-my! What a winning team! Feminist writer/director Mary Harron (who's F-N clueless about hardcore horror) and schlep-actor Christian Bale (who's F-N clueless. Period) Wow! What a winning team! <br/><br/>By putting these 2 mental-midgets together for the making of American Psycho it resulted in a potentially promising horror movie getting reduced to its absolute candy-assed worst. <br/><br/>(Well, hey, what the hell did I expect?) <br/><br/>Some years ago I had actually read Ellis's novel (this film is based upon that story). And, I'm tellin' ya, even though the book wasn't much to rave about, at least it did deliver a substantially horrific punch.<br/><br/>But, as expected, director Harron didn't do the book even the slightest bit of justice with it her snivelling screen-play, nor with her half-assed direction.<br/><br/>With Ellis's book the total focus of the story was on the graphically-detailed descriptions of mutilation and dismemberment. And, believe me, his story was downright hideous in its detail.<br/><br/>But, on the other hand, under Harron's direction, this F-N clueless bimbo completely sanitized the story's gore to the point of almost eliminating it right out of the story. And, this, in my opinion, was a big no-no.<br/><br/>Harron literally reduced the ghastly-cruel American Psycho character to the level of being an disinfected American Namby-Pamby boy. And, this really sucked, big-time.<br/><br/>This film didn't come anywhere near to generating the same gruesome horror that the book did. And, it should have been right on par with it.<br/><br/>And, speaking about gross miscasting. It certainly didn't help matters, at all, that Christian Bale was the one chosen to play the title character, Patrick Bateman.<br/><br/>Ha! What a pathetic joke Bale was in his part. His performance (as usual) was totally forgettable. He was nothing but a big, dreary bore who, under Harron's incompetent direction, came across as being some sort of a dimwit stand-up comic whose high-point in the story came about when he gave himself a facial.<br/><br/>(Spare me!) <br/><br/>On top of the terrible dialogue, the shallow characters, and the endless scenes involving expensive dinners in chic restaurants (ho-hum!), this picture (much to my annoyance) turned into one, long commercial, blatantly selling its 1980s, pop music soundtrack.<br/><br/>A good part of American Psycho's story was dominated by one tired, old pop song after another. There were 30 songs in total. And, I swear that from this day onwards, I absolutely refuse to ever listen to the likes of Phil Collins, or Huey Lewis ever again.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>This is a perfect horror movie for people who want to see a horror movie that isn't a horror movie."

","If you haven't seen the film yet, after 14 years since it's release, be prepared for spoilers. The soundtrack is mostly distracting. Except for when you know that Patrick is listening to the same thing as us - the viewers - the soundtrack seems to want you to believe that this is the music that everyone listened to during the 1987 and it didn't matter who they were. Even trying to believe that this is Patrick's soundtrack, I found him boring and cliché. Truly, the soundtrack did not live up to the personality of the main protagonist and who he believed himself to be. The theatrical release of this film was edited poorly as you get to the conclusion : at no point is the big reveal, well, big. It seems like an afterthought. It leads to confusion, not the great, ""A ha!"" You are never given the opportunity to rehash the film and understand that it was mostly in Patrick's head. The only other downfall for this film would be that given the satirical tone, most of the time the satire was boring. Christian Bale was fine as were the other actors. The cinematography top notch. But for what must be a heavily edited film, I did like it."

","American Psycho is highly regarded on IMDb, many have listed it in their favorite movies lists, this movie is based on the book by the same name. But I just don't understand what's so good about it. <br/><br/>American Psycho is basically a story about a man who goes on a rampage killing everyone for no apparent reason, apparently he is a sociopath, a psychopath, a man who has mood disorders or multiple personality disorder or something else which is never made clear. One time before killing he has a sudden change of heart and chooses not to kill. He just doesn't kill but completely mutilates the bodies of the victims and cuts them to pieces and displays them in his second house which he uses for most of killings.<br/><br/>Now I enjoy stories about serial killers, and Bateman shares many of their antics and method of operations, which is a plus point for me, I have also read stories and articles about serial killers and investigations, and also watched movies like Silence of the Lambs and Se7en which were both fantastic mind you. But while those films were very violent they had a meaning behind the killings, in this films there is no excuse or reason for Bateman's actions other than he is mentally unstable. Perhaps some therapy sessions with a psychologist or psychiatrist could have been used to make all this seem clear and find out what is really in his head and what's going on in his mind. Many directors alter the stories in movies as compared to the book so why not? <br/><br/>The main part which bothers me is the investigation part, Bateman kills so many people in the film but apparently the cops don't care about investigating the whereabouts, finding out what happened and find out who maybe involved, gather a list of suspects, perhaps try to find Bateman's house where many people went missing, other movies based on serial killers had this aspect but it is missing in American Psycho? It could have seriously made this film more fun to watch. Instead we have one detective who investigates the disappearance of Bateman's business rival but still finds nothing after his minor and very brief appearances.<br/><br/>The cops in the climax come after Bateman in force and overpower forcing him to escape, take refuge and confess all killings to his lawyer, but the cops did not go after him because of all the murders but because he shot an old lady who saw him trying to kill a cat. Right!. Then we are left with a wonderful twist in the ending that the murders were all Bateman's imagination. Bateman's flat where he did the serial killing was empty up for sale and not even his, apparently he killed no one all this was in his head. Again the ""it was a dream"" concept used to get rid of the cop investigation aspect. The director of the film said that she did not want the people to think it was all Bateman's imagination, but honestly that is the only way to analyze the ending otherwise the ending makes no sense to me at all. <br/><br/>No matter how you analyze the ending, dream or no dream the film's overall plot is boring and the ending is nothing we haven't seen before. One way or the other this movie will confuse the hell out of you to decide what is real and what is Bateman's imagination. Bateman's conversations with the investigator were they real? Was his assistant being in his flat real or not? Bateman attempting to attack that homosexual businessman in the toilet was that also real or all in his head? Seriously this movie messes with your head. Movies like the Usual Suspects and even Fight Club which follow a similar concept, made it all perfectly clear by the end.<br/><br/>Other than Bateman's serial killing the movie is filled with a lot of boring dialogue which is too cliché and almost painful to sit through, that dialogue bores me out of my mind and is not even a contributing factor to any of his killings apart from one perhaps, when he kills a businessman. The Investigator and Bateman's conversations are also nothing special. Bateman also spills out random threats for no reason but the people pretend they did not hear him as if he did not say anything, which ends up looking stupid. <br/><br/>Christian Bale's performance in the only saving grace of this film as he is really into the Bateman character and is given almost all the screen time, the other's are honestly nothing special and only there to fill a gap. Obviously if you enjoy tons of violence in films and the gore you will also find it as a high point, I don't, I am fine with violence but not only this is too much, there is no real meaning behind it all but the ending makes it all meaningless. I don't understand why this film is so highly regarded. Maybe the book makes things more clear and may make an interesting read but this film was a chore to watch in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall: 4/10"

","I never liked Brett Easton Ellis' book and I didn't intend to go and see the film. This may seem odd for a lizard with an interest in serial murderers but I am very choosy about the killers I choose to study and the way they are presented, whether they are fictional or not. For instance I have totally lost interest in Thomas Harris and Hannibal Lector. Harris was a wonderful author and Manhunter was a wonderful film. Harris continued to be a brilliant author with ""Silence of the Lambs"" but this was ruined forever, as far as I am concerned, by Anthony Hopkins hammy interpretation. I suppose Jonathan Demme has to take a lot of the blame even though I admire some of his other films. But Lambs killed Lector for me and I can't be arsed to read ""Hannibal"" even though I bought it almost on the day of publication. I think only Michael Mann directing and Brian Cox as Lector could restore my faith in this franchise.<br/><br/>The selective clips of American Psycho shown on TV and the interest of my family and friends in serial killers persuaded me to go to the multiplex. You should know right away that the film is very true to the book i.e. it is nihilistic, narcissistic and several other things beginning with n. All right-minded people and reptilians will hate it. I can confirm this because I saw it with Warrior Mouse, Princess Lizardess and a famous musician and film-score composer (no, really) who shall remain nameless. (But lets just call him Monarch of the Glen for now shall we?) To a man, woman, mouse and lizard we all thought it to be utterly tedious, boring and a complete waste of celluloid. In summary there is one joke, repeated several times, which is mildly amusing and at the expense of Phil Collins and other godawful 80s singers, an admittedly excellent performance by Christian Bale, given the pointlessness of the whole exercise, and long minutes of tedium.<br/><br/>It was nagging away at me for some time what this film reminded me of. Then it came to me. It was obvious. American Psycho is the big budget version of The Blair Witch Project. Think about it. Both films are full of characters that are so hateful you wish they would get chopped to pieces by the psycho killer after spending five minutes with them. After 90 minutes in their presence you are prepared to wield the chainsaw yourself in order to end the torture of watching them. Both films have been hyped by their publicists and failed literary critics (i.e. film critics) as being masterpieces even though my cats have a better understanding of what makes a good film. Both films last for around 95 minutes and both films feel as though they last for 95 hours whilst you live through them. Both films feature characters who are afraid of things that normal citizens don't give a second thought to; in the case of Blair Witch, a fear of twigs, in the case of American Psycho, a fear of naff business cards or failure to get bookings at snotty restaurants that only women who want to become stick insects so they can star in more crap Hollywood products would want to eat in anyway. None of the characters in either film can tell the difference between fantasy and reality; no audience member of either film cares."

Nevertheless biggest flaw of the movie was while he was killing people, police was almost absent from the scene. Is it possible for a guy to kill someone in a apartment premises and have not even one policeman come and inquire into that? hard to believe.... It looked as if he is just doing anything he is wanting to.

And if all the right-wing lobbies that complain about sex and violence in movies spend their whole time watching the stuff in order to complain about it, then how come they're not converted into our very own Patrick Batemans? The film actually raises this point itself, with Bateman (Christian Bale), watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre while exercising.<br/><br/>What bothers me more is that films which usually attract such controversy as this usually have the saving grace of being actually quite good - A Clockwork Orange being a notable success in that field. American Psycho, meanwhile, is a fairly average movie, with gory violence that neither shocks nor compels, and thus fails both ways."

","Attempting to outline the breakdown in human society, American Psycho is the story of a so-called serial killer and his spiralling journey as he falls deeper into his psychotic state.<br/><br/>As a woman, watching the beginning of American Psycho, I thought I had hit jack-pot; Christian Bale, ( thankfully 'Batman' Bale rather than 'The Machinist' Bale), butt naked, oiled up and in a shower. But sadly this mouth-watering ambiance was not to last. After I snapped out of my trance and was engaged back into the words of his character Patrick Bateman, I began to take account of the intense depth of his skin routine, and how this was so focused upon. This was just the beginning of a number of clues pointing towards Bateman's insanity.<br/><br/>Together with the monotone narration of Bale's character, the in-depth analysis of what seem to be meaningless aspects such as business cards and skin routines are what makes this film so eerie and odd. The direction and camera work attempt to capture the mess inside Bateman's head, drastically contrasting the atmosphere of the scenes, from a brutal murder scene, straight into massage therapy. By highlighting Batemans obsession with his outer self, it implies that society similarly tries to perfect its outer body to cover the guilt of the uncontrollable nature inside most of us. It attempts to portray how nothing is ever good enough, and that you will always want more, or something else.<br/><br/>Bale plays the role brilliantly, twisting and turning his character to depict an 'American Psycho', exactly I imagine as director Mary Harron wished for. At one point he even became so uncontrollably crazy, that he depicted every character that Jim Carrey has ever played, which doesn't say a lot for Jim Carrey, but indeed a lot for Bale! However, as an audience, you never learn to like or relate to any of the characters, which sadly sets you back from the film. If Harron was attempting to describe society as broken, then relating to at least one broken character would have allowed the audience to step into their role, however, not at any point during the film do we feel any closeness to any character. Although Justine Theroux and Josh lucas were brilliantly cast , fitting the parts perfectly of Sexist, Womanising, Businessmen.<br/><br/>Perhaps this would have worked better as a TV series, much like Hurron's other work, as the techniques she induces upon this film, would be much more appropriately suited to TV. Adapting this film from a book was a good idea in theory, deep concepts, brilliantly depicted characters and an intriguing plot, but perhaps Hurron was the wrong person for the job, as it just did not work in practise.<br/><br/>It may have been captivating, and Bale may have been brilliant, but in all reality, I would have been quite happy just watching the first shower scene! 5/10"

","spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler I'm writing this because i just wanna give my opinion on the movie and its meaning and ending .. people seem to be confused as to whether he killed AL those people ... yes he did kill all those people... at first he enjoys it he loves it .if you notice the Paul Allen murder hes dancing hes happy hes doing moonwalks, its exciting to him.. as time goes on and more and more people die Patrick starts to loose his mind ... the first time we are shown this is when the ATM say feed stray cat, after which he shoots a women who witnessed him torturing the cat, this is the first time Patrick is hallucinating hes simply is loosing his grip.. if you notice the police show up instantly which would never happen also he shoots them and 4 shots blow up 2 cops cars and kill everyone.. and if you pay very close attention everything gets silent and he stares at his gun in confusion suggesting that even he cant understand whats happening .. also he goes into the buildings and kills 2 more men and then goes to his office and there he sees helicopters flying around outside ....ofcourse there were no helicopters just his paranoia in his office he makes his confession.. now the next day everything goes back to normal he goes to Paul Allen's place where he was taking the hookers and storing all the bodies.. everything is gone the walls are painted and there is a very strange spooky women who tells him to not cause any trouble and to just leave and never come back... she simply disposed of the bodies and painted the walls because to her it was interfering with her job and her pay... she didn't care about justice only money and greed .. so he gets away with it.... the movie is not a slasher film its about the wall street boom in the 80s and how everyone looked the same wore the same glasses ties went to the same restaurants all had business cards ...that is why everyone confuses each other people often say Patrick isn't how we see him cause everyone says through out the movie that Patrick is a looser.. Patrick is indeed fit like a model and does look very well taken care of .. and he did kill everyone in the movie except for the police car and the 2 men in the building ... and the ending suggest that even tho he wanted to get caught even tho he told his friends his lawyers they all took it as a joke for the simple fact that he is a wall street investment broker for instance take the scene when he drag Paul Allen's body thru the lobby with a huge blood trail across the lobby the doorman doesn't suspect anything because of the way Patrick dresses and where he lives. same with the girl at the dry cleaners.. when he says its cranberry juice.. if Patrick had a beard and jeans and a hood on his head I'm sure he would have been caught... appearance is everything... there is a great line in the film when timothy Bryce played by Justin Theroux says about Ronald Reagen look at him on the outside hes just a gentle old man but on the inside... suggesting he hides a deeper character we don't no.. and Patrick Bateman says only to the audience but the inside doesn't matter!!...i simply love this movie and i have only recently discovered it maybe a week ago and i watched it over and over because it leaves allot things for the viewer to not only figure out but to make answers for themselves.. i hope i helped those of you confused on this movie"

","""American Psycho"" isn't a clichéd thriller involving a serial killer as always-- at least. This film has a weird story about a man obsessed with his body who kills lots of people, getting away with murder very strangely. For instance, there are cops and cops in front of him shooting him but they miss all the shots, while he just shoots twice or three times and the police cars explode out of nowhere. His name is Patrick Bateman and he proves to be a very annoying man, talking and talking about the most irritating things on earth. And Christian Bale isn't that good in this character; when he cried, I thought it was the character acting to fool people, but actually, it's the actor himself acting lame. Not to mention the irritating conversations about restaurants and reservations.<br/><br/>The good thing about this film is the fact that it's oddly very entertaining; aside that, it shows no originality, surprise or strong performances, but spending 102 minutes in this isn't a total waste of time."

","Christian Bale is one of the best actors of our time, and he really showed it back in 2000 with his underrated performance in American Psycho. American Psycho, in my opinion, is his best performance. With every film he does, he always tries very hard, and you can tell with his performance in this film.<br/><br/>Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a wall street worker who cares too much about appearance and not really about anyone else. But secretly, he is a sociopath that murders a ton of people, including hookers and co-workers.<br/><br/>Thats basically the movie. It may not sound like a lot, but oh yes it is. The scenes with the murder are the most engaging. American Psycho is non stop entertaining, and its Bale who holds out interest.<br/><br/>Never before have I seen a more disturbed maniac than Patrick Bateman. Bale brings the life into this psycho, and you can't take your eyes off of him. Though he's such a horrible person, I liked him, and its hard to like a sociopath. But when Christian Bale is that sociopath, its hard not to.<br/><br/>Bale is the heart and soul of American psycho. Besides him, you won't be able to take your eyes off of it, and there is some dark humor here that takes off. I have seen American psycho numerous times, and there are tons of scenes that I look forward to. As demented as this film is, its also brilliant.<br/><br/>A"
"oneguyrambling","5","0","1","8 June 2011"," Worth a look if only for Bale's full-on performance.
","American Psycho owes more to the 80s than the Wedding Singer, if it was set in the present day it would likely still see some acclaim due to Christian Bale's intense gonzo performance and achieve notoriety due to the scenes of sudden graphic violence, but it is the 80s setting that separates it from the pack.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is Patrick Bateman, a handsome, privileged man with a great job (that he never seems to do), a beautiful fiancé played by Reese Witherspoon (whom he despises) and an immaculate home furnished with only the best and most stylish.<br/><br/>Patrick spends hours in the home gym, on tanning beds and in the bathroom using a vast array of creams, gels and treatments that even metrosexuals might think ""too much"", he seems the perfect catch, an ideal employee and a great friend – aside from one thing oh all right heaps of things – he's the f*cking titular psycho after all! In this Gordon Gekko era America where Boy George is still deemed supercool everything is a p*ssing contest, colleagues aim to get the best tables at the most exclusive restaurants not for the food but the satisfaction of subtly letting the fact slip to others just for their expression, suggesting the wrong restaurant is perhaps worse than death. In most cases when they actually get to the restaurant their inner cynic won't allow them to enjoy the food anyway.<br/><br/>My favourite line in the film is when someone says ""I'm not hungry but I'd like to have reservations someplace"", this pretty accurately describes the level most of the characters in American Psycho inhabit.<br/><br/>Everything is like this, the desire for more and better is everywhere: the hottest partner, the nicest apartment in the best spot with the best view, even new business cards that seem exactly the same as the ones next to them are thrown down like gauntlets to be scrutinized and rated with envy and embarrassment – especially if one made the mistake of choosing the off-white over the ivory-white! Each conversation is full of similar one-upmanship, vacuous banal bragging and specious empty statements. At one point Patrick keeps his dinner companions transfixed with line after pandering line about world peace and fairness to others, and far from the eye-rolling treatment that he would rightfully deserve he is congratulated for his obviousness.<br/><br/>Each day is eight or nine hours of sitting in an office not working followed by the inevitable dilemma of where to go to be seen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately aside from being a fairly superficial human being Patrick also battles inner demons, demons that sit on each shoulder and suggest that he do horrible things to random people, things involving axes, chainsaws, agony and dismemberment.<br/><br/>Patrick constantly battles these voices though he fears is fighting a losing battle as his rising hatred and disgust at the state of society requires some form of action. He attempts to keep a grip even though at times it seems the only reasonable course of action is terrible violence and the slaughter of those beneath him. Given the fact that no-one seems to actually pay attention to others at times Patrick casually describes his homicidal thoughts and acts, but these horrific words fall on deaf ears tacked on to vacant heads.<br/><br/>Eventually Naughty Patrick starts winning the battle for booking Patrick's day to day activities, something ""normal"" society should be wary of. Let's just say if Patrick starts expounding on the merits of a particular musician or band – just run for the door.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have an extremely high body count but some of the visuals are very graphic and shown in some detail. The elaborate façade that Patrick has created once a colleague goes missing and the investigation lead by Detective Donald Kimble (Willem Dafoe) repeatedly circles back to him. The stress Patrick feels in these casual questionings is palpable, as is the sweat that almost immediately forms on his brow as he searches for an excuse to close the Q&A session. It seems the only sane and grounded person around Patrick is his wide eyed and perhaps a little naïve personal assistant Jean (Chloe Sevigny), and eventually Patrick decides to throw her a bone and ask her out for dinner To say more would be unfair, American Psycho isn't so much a horror film as it is a statement of how society has started drowning in its own apathy – at least according to the film – the film sees Patrick take whatever actions necessary to maintain his tenuous connection with sanity and release his frustrations. When a situation gets too stressful for him his go-to exit line is always the same ""I have got to return some videotapes.<br/><br/>I found it odd that this film was directed by a woman, given that in general women are treated as mere objects of conquest or lust – when the credits rolled 90% of women aren't even granted last names – I'd think about it more but I need to return some videotapes <br/><br/>Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. A film defined by the 80s, I found the ending to be disappointing, but in reality the film itself only sporadically held my interest. Worth a look if only for Bale's full-on performance."
"garyvanhorn","8","0","1","11 January 2011"," A very good film that requires some thought to enjoy.
","Christian Bale is an enormously talented actor and he is on full display as a psychotic wall street businessman. I usually pan slasher/thriller movies, they tend to annoy me with meaningless gore and overused clichés, but not so with American Psycho. The movie really takes the time to get inside the head of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) as he acts out his frustration and jealously over life, work, relationships, pretty much everything in increasingly violent and spectacularly homicidal ways.<br/><br/>The entire time you can just feel the madness writhing beneath the surface of Bale's character, and often it slips out in blatantly obvious ways that are overlooked by others or taken as humor, much to their dismay after he hacks them to bits. There is a reoccurring theme of mistaken identity and/or locational confusion. This is important but I don't really want to tell you why, I think it's better if you figure it out for yourself and then wonder. I need to get my own copy of American Psycho so I can see it again at my leisure so that I might pick up on every small detail that might unlock the secrets of the film."

"Boba_Fett1138","9","0","3","30 November 2010"," The fabulous, insane Patrick Bateman.
","This is one very well done movie, that got greatly directed and acted out by its impressive cast.<br/><br/>It's not really a movie that follows a clear main story but it instead gives us a view in the head of a young, successful and handsome guy, who seemingly has it all but behind his human mask actually is being an emotionless, murderous psychopath, who starts executing his weird fantasies during the nights. He more and more starts loosing it and looses both his grip on reality and the ability to keep himself and his urges under control. In all honesty, the best serial killer movies are all like this and instead of picking a real storyline it focuses more on the madness and its main character.<br/><br/>It's a pleasantly directed movie, that picks a more light approach, rather than an heavy serious one and it takes us into the insane world and mind of the main character. The movie doesn't ever really become an odd or eccentric one but it still does a very good job at capturing the right mood and atmosphere.<br/><br/>But it's also really definitely true that the movie and its characters work out due to the acting. Christian Bale is really perfect and quite amazing that this guy still hasn't been nominated for an Oscar, considering all of the great roles he has played over the last couple of years, this movie of course included. He's perfectly obsessive, cocky and charming and he was for a huge part responsible for me liking this movie as much as i did. But the movie also really has an impressive supporting cast list. It aren't really the names that are know by the big audience but it are names that are always respected and liked by the experts. Not to sound nit-picky but I wasn't as pleased with the casting of some of the female roles. Not because they're not great actors but more because of their very plain looks. The character of Bateman is supposed to be surrounded, admired and chased after by the most beautiful women and I'm sorry but most women in this movie just aren't that impressive looking. Perhaps it's due to the fact that this is a movie that got directed by a female, so she might not have had such an eye for it as a man would had. But this is about really the only thing that slightly bothered me about this movie, which should tell you something about how great it is.<br/><br/>It's really a movie that I liked watching because of how beautifully insane it all got done.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"geoff-hollingsworth","9","0","1","28 October 2010"," In a word...
","Excellent. <br/><br/>The way Bale portrays Patrick Bateman both engages the character with the audience and keeps us guessing his true nature. The constant changes in personality given a further presence of darkness and intrigue, which is only heightened by the ending. The artistic feel of the film, which I feel if symbolised straight after Bateman kills someone then is seen drawing the details of their death as an infant gave greater depth to both him as a character and the story, and made it all that much more complex.<br/><br/>However, there are some minor details which personally, took away from the realness the movie delivered. Such as Bateman standing on the stairway, simply watching his victim run away then just 'dropping' the chainsaw which, lucking for him, hit her. Also, the confrontation with the police where a single bullet blew up and destroyed two cars was both over the top and unnecessary."

","During the 1980s, a Wall Street yuppie leads an alternate life as a serial killer. This starts out as a delicious black comedy, with Bale delivering a terrific performance as a man who is not only a cold-blooded killer but a connoisseur of pop music. It's quite amusing listening to him analyze the music of Huey Louis and Whitney Houston. Unfortunately, the film falls apart down the stretch. Harron's direction is crisp, but the screenplay fails to reach a satisfactory conclusion, perhaps a difficult feat to pull off given the nature of the source novel. There are too many loose ends and the ending is much too ambiguous."
"toddheltonrules","5","0","2","24 June 2010"," Falls Short of the Book
","To say the least, this movie really falls short of the book. I was a huge fan of the book and have read it two or three times. Easton Ellis did a masterful piece at painting descriptions and being as graphic as possible. While it would have been impossible to include every element of the 300+ page book, the movie fell short of my expectations. Bale did a fantastic job as Bateman, but outside of that, I couldn't really point out any other top notch performances. With the bad acting and the forced details, it just seemed like a terrible attempt to capture Easton Ellis' masterpiece.<br/><br/>My favorite scene of the movie was the business card scene, which captured the jealous Bateman had perfectly, but again, outside of that there was nothing entirely special. The prostitute murder scene was stupid, the laundry scene was decent, the dinners were boring and contrived. This movie really could have been something special if they put ANY effort into it, but sadly, they did not.<br/><br/>For that, I must give it 5 stars. The 7.4 rating is an absolute joke and this is coming from arguably the biggest fan of the book."

","American Psycho is one of those movies that will leave the critics divided. Is a kind of movie that if you don't get the point of what's going on you are just going to think about it as an awful mess. I got the point ( i mean i read Bret Easton Ellis's book, but i read it long after i watched and loved the movie) and i loved it. Christian Bale (who i might say is one of the best, if not the best, actors currently working) does a great job playing socialite Patrick Bateman, who's only obsessions in life are taking extremely good care of himself (using a large variety of beauty products, obsessively working out, etc.), going to the bests night clubs and restaurants, and last but not least, satisfying his increasing homicidal impulses. In fact early in the movie we see that Patrick Bateman isn't at all how he wants to be seen by his peers (he is shown as a charming stock broker who has friends and a girlfriend), in fact he is an increasingly psychotic homicidal man who is so bored with his yuppie lifestyle that the only way he feels alive and really feels in touch with the world that surrounds him is by engaging in disturbing and gruesome murders. The worst part is that even with his increasingly chaotic and erratic behavior, he seems more aware about the disconnection from humanity that this yuppie lifestyle gives to the people in it than his peers (theres is a scene in which Patrick and his friends are literally drooling over some presentation cards). I don't think that Harron's approach to the story is at all perfect (having already read the book), and as i said is a pretty tough story to understand. But in her defense, one of the greatest things of a story like American psycho is that you have to keep an open mind to see beyond the violence and the massacres, which also happens while reading the book. As i said Bale's performance is just plain excellent, it might seem over the top sometimes, but believe me, thats Patrick Bateman: a man constantly over the edge of psychotic boredom who could snap at any moment. The funny thing is that their co-workers are so clueless about everything and so self-centered that they don't seem to realize the homicidal maniac they have next door (not even by the fact Patrick sometimes playfully confesses his urges to them). Bale deserved at least Oscar buzz for this role, he is just plain perfect. As a side note, i hope Hollywood starts rewarding him for his carefully methodical performances or he could easily become the next Jeff bridges (a great actor whose every performances are nearly flawless but doesn't get the recognition he deserves): i know Bridges won the Oscar this year, but it was long overdue. The supporting cast is very good too. By playing clueless and self centered characters the wrong actor might look stiff, but the cast does a great job with their roles. Chloe Sevigny, willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas,.. All the cast do a great job with their respective roles. All in all is a great movie, and one of my all time favorites. Is the kind of movie in which with every new viewing you start noticing new elements and themes that are being developed and satirized. Great Performances, Extremely great cult classic."

","I had been looking forward to seeing this for a long time and I've got to say that after finally seeing it, I was a bit disappointed. It's not that it was a bad movie. It just wasn't what I expected it to be. I thought the film would be right up my alley, but instead it was just way too out there and weird for my tastes. Not to mention the ending completely baffled me. There are some good answers for any questions I may have had when the film was over, but when I was trying to piece things together, there always seemed to be something that totally foiled whatever theory I was going with. Perhaps, this is the whole idea behind the film. It's possible that the filmmakers wanted to leave the ending open to interpretation and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In the end, I'll say that I thought it was good, just not as good as I had hoped. I wouldn't purchase this myself, as this is not a film I could ever see myself watching again, but I have no problem referring this as a rental to anyone who isn't squeamish and easily weirded out."

","Well I'll do it anyway: Patrick Bateman is an average businessman. He has his suck-up friends, his so-called fiancé, and an expensive apartment. He is in good shape, he's healthy except for the use of cocaine, and is on a diet. He hates it when somebody has an more expensive or more exclusive version of whatever it is that he has. He loves Phil Collins music. He brings prostitutes to his home. He kills homeless people. He kills the people he hates. He performs violent experiments with women. He IS the American Psycho.<br/><br/>This movie went way beyond my expectations. This not a slasher film, although it has the same characteristics. It's about a man living in a shallow life. A life where a man is only worth the sum of his possessions. A life where the exterior and the suit is more important than your personality. And Patrick Bateman handles it in an unusual way. If you have seen the trailer you've seen him with knifes and chainsaws, etc. but this is not all that is to this movie. yes, it is violent and not for the faint of hearth, but it was a lot less gory than I thought. Then again this is a psychological thriller and in many ways that can be almost as scary.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman: ""I have all the characteristics of a human being: blood, flesh, skin, hair; but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why. My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip"". If you're a person who understands complicated films, and you've just read this quote, don't tell me you're not intrigued. Believe me this movie will blow your mind. And just wait 'till the ending, it's amazing.<br/><br/>This movie is a 10/10 in my book. If you can handle it, watch it, this is a must see film. And a severely underrated film."

","Impossibly vain and hot-bodied Christian Bale (as Patrick Bateman) enjoys looking good, eating in fine Manhattan-area restaurants, and blondes coming in pairs. His yuppie world is shattered when cute colleague Jared Leto (as Paul Allen) shows off a better business card, and an ability to score Friday evening reservations at ""Dorsia"". So, meanwhile, or coincidently, Mr. Bale's homicidal tendencies veer out of control. Previously, Bale killed a random night-time pick-up; now a rampant blood-lusting ""American Psycho"", Bale begins to kill almost anything that moves <br/><br/>This bizarre satire on 1980s serial killers, musical tastes, and Reaganomics was based on a more gruesome (than even this ""Unrated Cut"" film) novel by Bret Easton Ellis. The level of gore aside, director Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" is very different, in tone; and, that's entirely acceptable. It's stranger on film to see Bale getting away with so much mayhem - and his aim with a chainsaw is to die for - but, the film's flaw, in my opinion, is that the story ""twist"" (the questionable reality concerning Bateman's crimes) is not possible according to what you see on screen.<br/><br/>Mainly, this is due to very strong performances by a couple of women in the cast. It's impossible, for example, to consider pining secretary Chloe Sevigny (as Jean) operating in the protagonist's psyche solely - this is painfully obvious when she sits at his desk, and looks through his doodles. The ""point-of-view"" is clearly off the mark. Prostitute Sara Seymour (as ""Christie"") is another registering such a strong characterization. These lovely, vulnerable performances are too hip for the room. Others in the cast operate in the killer's world. Bale's lead is excellent.<br/><br/>******* American Psycho (1/21/00) Mary Harron ~ Christian Bale, Chloe Sevigny, Sara Seymour, Guinevere Turner"

Every now and then I pick it out, and say to myself: I wonder what this is about? I then watch it. It is quite watchable. A couple of days later I've completely forgotten it. I think I've watched it about 3/4 times, perhaps even more. It must be the most unmemorable film I've ever seen, and I don't really know why. Possibly it's because the things that are shown to be happening aren't really happening. If they didn't happen, why bother recalling them ? The hero has problems, that much is certain, and the reason, it seems, is because he wants to fit into a totally shallow lifestyle.

I kept on waiting for the ""good parts"" until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Let me also tell you that for any movie reading a book should not be a pre-requisite....if there is , then that is a flaw with the movie.<br/><br/>The movie deals with a psychotic character Patrick Baleman who hides his psychotic part from his co-workers and friends(?)....In reality Bateman has no friends, everyone is superficial...As the movie progresses Bateman's veil of sanity slowly falls off....When you watch the movie, you are unable to interpret what is real and what is imaginary....The film depicts how these could co-exist.....It depicts the movie from the view-point of a psychotic So why did i find it boring???? 1)Because there were no clear explanation of why Bateman became a psychotic....it is not necessary that a movie explains this...but I find it interesting only if that is explained...Then the movie can be enjoyed ....You find fun to see a mind unravel...FightClub is a good example...Apart from the fact that FightClub deals with a more ""visually interesting"" psychiatry case viz MPD....there is a proper logical explanation of the main character became a psychotic....not the case with American Psycho....Add to this the fact the condition he suffers from is not a very ""visually stimulating"" one and that it is in fact depicted in a boring fashion, makes it a forgettable movie experience.<br/><br/>Let me give you an analogy....People enjoy playing chess, its fun to use our mind designing strategies...Its even fun to watch a game of chess....You find it fun to watch the moves, how one player uses a strategy and how the other counters it....But can u enjoy a game of chess if you don't understand whats going on -if the game goes above you head(like if two top level players are playing)....Now imagine a situation where two fools are playing it...Again u can't find it interesting to watch their game....u don't get it, because there is nothing to get!!!! I don't see where is the fun in knowing just that Bateman is paranoid...Afterall you are seeing American Psycho and Mateman himself declares from the start that ""I am mad"" 2)Also because..some psychiatry oriented themes can be interesting even if u don't get an explanation of the psychosis...if the premise is interesting...""Identity"" is a good example, there is no explanation as to why there is the disease per se.....but the premise was interesting...In American Psycho there is no premise, because the boundaries between real an imaginary is not clear...You see hallucination after hallucination or delusion after delusion...interspersed with reality -but you don't know which is which and you soon loose interest (atleast I did) In short I found nothing interesting with American Psycho I believe people find it interesting because they think this is a masterpiece and you are supposed to like it.<br/><br/>One guy has said (in another comment) American Psycho is fascinating because Bateman is a complex character..yes it is complex...its more than complex it is psychotic, but not interesting....I don't find it interesting to know that how a psychotic can exist with a a very thin superficial mask of sanity....Here i think the director is at fault or the writer of the book...that they failed to make it interesting.....Why would anyone want to know about someone just because he is psychotic The only thing I found interesting in American Psycho was to note how Bateman's co-workers could be so indifferent to his problems...in fact they don't even realize there is a problem!!!!!"
"TheSteelHelmetReturns","10","0","1","1 October 2009"," One of my top ten favourite films.
","American Psycho is a bit of a no-brainer for me, I loved that it was one of the first films during that time (I think with The Wedding Singer being the other example before that) to be a modern film set during my favourite decade, the eighties, and about the eighties. Not only that, it was set during the best part of that decade – the late eighties. The vastly underrated Mary Harron brings out the satirical edge of Bret Easton Ellis's novel and Christian Bale gives the best performance I have ever seen from him. Watching him argue with the Chinese lady at the dry cleaner reminded me of an eighties leading man like Tom Cruise or Richard Gere and to see him change from the confident yuppie with a sinisterly dark sense of humour to a pathetic whimpering psychotic bearing his soul to his lawyer's answering machine is made of win. Luckily, American Psycho goes beyond being just a showcase of Bale's acting ability thanks to the film's attention to detail in set pieces including Patrick Bateman's morning routine and the uber-modern restaurant dishes as well as a strong cast to help complement Bale's madness like Chloe Sevigny, Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto in ""that"" scene."
"DylansFearFiles","10","0","1","13 August 2009"," The Best Satire Since Fight Club
","I like the satire and thriller genres. American Psycho is a spoof of yuppie-culture in the 1980s. The movie is basically about how some people see material possessions as more important than human life, which Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his murders symbolize. The movie is based on the controversial bestselling novel by Brett Easton Ellis (Less Than Zero, The Rules of Attraction).<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman has everything, a beautiful fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), wealth, a great job at Pierce & Pierce, a big circle of friends, nice clothes and most of all: an addiction to murder. Patrick Bateman descends further and further into insanity as his murder spree goes along. He murders and sometimes rapes colleagues or even strangers without hesitation. This great film also features a great supporting cast including Willem Dafoe as Detective Kimball and Chloe Sevigny as Bateman's secretary, Jean.<br/><br/>American Psycho is a disturbing and intelligent trip into the life and exploits of a madman. This is probably Christian Bale's greatest performance, it shocks me that he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. But then again, it isn't that surprising considering that the Academy usually gives their happy movies the awards. Since when has Christian Bale been disappointing?<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is an interesting character. Who is likable at certain points but mostly downright despicable. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times even praised Bale's performance as ""heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor"". Indeed, he is right.<br/><br/>The movie also has a lot of humor. Mainly the humor comes from the character's personalities. Each of these characters that Bateman hangs out with are total embodiments of the many stereotypes about yuppies. <br/><br/>American Psycho has even spawned an LARGE cult-following. People on the IMDb message board even constantly quote the film, I have never seen that on any other board here. I guess that just shows how great the movie is. I hope that one day American Psycho earns a spot in the Top 250. I don't see how it hasn't made it yet.<br/><br/>American Psycho is also not just about a man running around killing people, like another consumer satire, Chuck Palahnuik's Fight Club (I also recommend the film and the novel of that), American Psycho produces a good and true message about consumer culture and materialism. As I said, it is about how people sometimes see material possessions as even more important than human life.<br/><br/>Here is a couple of notes about the fantastic book by Bret Easton Ellis and how it compares to the movie. The movie and the book are both great but the book, as usual, has so much more detail and you hear more of Bateman's sick thoughts. The movie is more like an examination of a sociopath's daily life while the book is basically a descent into Hell. It even starts with the lines from Dante's Inferno, ""Abandon all hope ye who enter here.""<br/><br/>This movie almost did not get made. It had developed so much controversy from feminists and animal rights groups before and after it had been published due to its graphic violence. The filmmakers had to remove a lot of the graphic violence and disturbing acts that Patrick Bateman commits (including cannibalism, only mentioned in the movie and necrophilia, both are described in great detail). I wouldn't watch this movie without reading the book. Beware, if you don't have a strong stomach: do not read the book, I found it hard to read on some parts.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tha_mongoose","Null","0","1","13 August 2009"," And tonight... I just had to kill a lot of people!
","While agreeing with most of what has already been said here about American Psycho, namely that Christian Bale (Patrick Bateman) pulls off what is evidently a complex role in a film with otherwise stellar supporting actors - Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny, who plays the adoring and sexy secretary very well, Justing Therou, by far the best of Bateman's colleagues acting-wise, and Jared Leto, who plays the bragging ""gun"", the associate who always has to have the last word and the best things, perfectly - there are some aspects of the movie that remain incomprehensible.<br/><br/>At the end of the picture, it is difficult to make sense of things. Harold the lawyer tells Bateman he had dinner with Paul Allen ten days ago, even though Bateman supposedly bludgeoned him to death with an axe.<br/><br/>So, has all we have been seeing thus forth in the movie been inside Patrick Bateman's head? What about his secretary - she uncovers his planner and realises he's nuts - scribbling and drawing murder scenes and clearly exhibiting an unhealthy psychological make-up. Why doesn't she do anything about it? In any case, the movie is well-crafted, of that there is no question. Not having read the book, comparisons are futile. A good pace and a well-presented main character, who appears obsessed with the most trivial details, keeping himself visibly fit, with his 1000 stomach crunches and facial masks and whatnot, but this ""outer shell"" hides darkness within.<br/><br/>8/10."
"Samiam3","8","0","1","24 July 2009"," Deadly movie
","I have not read the novel, but I couldn't care less, American Psycho is a pretty sensational picture horror picture. The whole thing is seductive and weird, sexually twisted and extreme, but strangely intelligent. <br/><br/>You can interpret this film many ways, but I guarantee you'll come away with something from watching one unstable man played brilliantly by Christian Bale, who is the most interesting fictional killer since Hannibal Lector. This is not a fun slice and dice picture, so do not go into this expecting a Friday the 13th or a Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Like Alfred Hitchcock's 'regular' Psycho, this is deep, thought provoking horror."

","Incredible Movie! First and foremost! This is a review in disregarding that specifics from the book were left out which would have been fun to see on screen but I understand that it may not have been possible.<br/><br/>Now this Movie as it is an incredible masterpiece, Patrick Bateman is a corner stone in Psycho's for movies after this movie, and due to that was because Christian Bale played that role to perfection! We have all come see what an incredible Actor Bale has become, he is a true method actor with every stretch of the word, he goes to the extreme to fulfill his roles in any movie he is in and this was no exception. This captures the insanity of a successful business man in the late 80's who has to put on a face for civilian life but behind closed doors he is a sociopath psychopath that has to feed on his murderous thirst of human life.<br/><br/>As stated earlier many things from the book were not put in however the movie is still a magnificent piece of art and Mary Harron did a great job with it, it is a shame she directs such few movies over her career I would love to watch more ""true"" films by her instead of all those television shows.<br/><br/>This has reached incredible plateau with everything it has achieved, and Patrick Bateman's character is something many have come to mimic the way he was created for film. This movie has also become a strong point of conversation piece due to the script writing which was phenomenal, next time reading something related to this film see how many references you can catch that come back to this film.<br/><br/>10/10 ~XTC <br/><br/>Ps. do you mind?

"ellieforpeace","9","0","1","11 July 2009"," A Dark and Bloody Satire of Capitalism and Masculinity.
","American Psycho had to be the most surprising movie ever for me. I just watched it because the title was intriguing, I had heard about it before, I figured it couldn't be so bad. I was very tired and about to sleep, but this kept me up with various conflicting emotions.<br/><br/>It is the story of a wealthy bank executive (Christian Bale) who is greedy to reach the top, and just as bloodthirsty. As his greed grows, so does his vanity, his sexual virility, his desire for success, his yearning to kill.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant, and the direction, nearly so. Mary Haddon did both, which is stunning. She calls the movie a feminist movie, and if you think long and hard enough about it, it really is. The man, Bateman, is so vain and egocentric in a distinctly male way, and it is this that leads to his yearning for blood. Nearly all the male characters are the same, and they usually all mark their manliness through the exploitation of women.<br/><br/>This also surprised me because of how deeply funny the movie can be at times. It is a satire of corporate greed and capitalism. There are a few points that are simple laugh-out-loud funny. Near the beginning, our main character boils with rage when his business card is outdone by another that looks exactly like his. In a scene a little later, he videotapes a threesome between himself and two hookers. He doesn't seem to derive any sexual pleasure from the women, but from admiring himself in mirrors. His long dissertations on conformity in popular music to his victims are highly amusing. He is the ultimate symbol of capitalism.<br/><br/>I didn't really want to like this movie because of Christian Bale. He seems like a horrible person. But his acting is superb, grade A, so I cannot complain about that. This is one of his best performances (I like to think because he relates to this character so much).<br/><br/>The only thing I have to complain about is Haddon's portrayal of violence. Bret Easton Ellis's book's very graphic descriptions of violence are what made it so controversial. However, Haddon backs away from the violence. She doesn't show much of it at all, which is a fault, because it shies away from the symbolism, and in a little bit of a way, makes the violence less of an issue, which it should not be (I subscribe heavily to the message of Funny Games).<br/><br/>But overall, I think it's brilliant. It's demented, it's substantial, it's funny. It's kind of like an even darker American Beauty. And it all completely works."

","This is a great movie that should have won an Academy Award. It is extremely compelling and Christian Bale could'nt have done it any better. He plays great, the character that people were picturing in their heads for 9 years (The time between when the book was released and the movie wasn't). Not only Christian but others as well, such as Reese Witherspoon and much more. This film is one of the best with such an art-house effect to it which really shows Batemans inside of his head. You couldn't know anymore about Bateman after viewing this film, as it goes deeply into every single part, chapter into Batemans mind and life. He really has no other feelings for anyone in his life. Well this film is worth viewing strongly. People may find it silly and weird as some of the stuff is very coincidentally happening. And also the way Bateman acts sometimes. But that just shows his character. So see it now. It is a great movie. One of the best. American Psycho..."

","American is just an evolution kid. His ideas and opinions about things like art are real (a connoisseur) while he being a pure intellectual .We can see this every time he confides his opinion about music and his political views (at the bar while ridiculing the gravity of the srilankan problem). He was sure no one things the way he things and is only sure they are hinting more of affectation. He knew there is no one who finds joy in himself and are only posing arguments then of reading their mind. In every way he is superior to everybody he sees. But the day he finds out that someone else was promoted to the vice-president to him, he was battered, perplexed. As he finds no reasons for this, he decides to kill those in line for the post and he does these killings not in pure conscience but the beastliness in him because his conscience will never finds the answer to the question why wasn't he promoted? As fail to kill those men for various reasons he only finds joy or mitigate his pain only by killing mean people whose lose of life will not be probed by police to a greater extent. Every time he fells perverse he tortures and kills prostitutes so on.. I heard somewhere there might also be another perception that he isn't killing people by only perceiving them and is only believing that he did them. This can't be fully true there may be some perceptions(like the cat,beggar etc..) but considering what he did with prostitutes there isn't much weight to this argument."

","The film is a pretty deep portrayal of yuppie culture. Yuppies may have a comfortable, extravagant lifestyle but lack identity.

The plot, particularly the ending leaves a large hint of ambiguity, allowing the viewers to have their own interpretation of the film's important elements. The dialogue is amazing, totally memorable, fun to pick apart and quotable. The atmosphere is bizarre and unbelievable, and that includes the actions of Pat Bateman. It gets even more interesting as the film progresses, and I love every bit of it.<br/><br/>This film can either be a deep character study or a movie to laugh to.

","I have just crossed with this DVD; for me American Psycho was one of those films that you know about its existence and you know that probably will be for your taste but you never watch it. Of course now I'm glad I finally watched this film. Anyway, it has a character that goes to an extreme and that deliver amusing situations from a ""world"" where a presentation card is amazingly relevant for the satisfaction of a person. The film moves really fast so it is impossible not to be attached to it with its many unique situations: at a point is absolute unique and also hilarious to hear the words that Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) express about his favourite music with such seriousness. In this character Bale is simply terrific, probably his best work to date, and the support cast is full of familiar faces: Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Justin Theroux and Chloë Sevigny and all making great performances.<br/><br/>In short, American Psycho is a very recommendable film and it is very easy to enjoy. It is all about the mind. 9.5 out of 10"
"vdecaire","7","0","1","21 July 2008"," The slippery-sloppy social and moral satire pays off in only a few categories.
","Something for the guys: brutal killings and tense chase scenes. Something for the girls: Racy photos of Christian Bale were reveled around the opening of the movie on the internet, but then it was said they were just stills from the movie, also Reese Witherspoon's presence will attract swarms of viewers eager to see her be legally blonde again. Something for the critics: A dynamic performance from Bale as Patrick Bateman, the supple design and layout of the 80's is superb, and the direction by Mary Harron. Something for the trashcan: The sloppiness near the end, and the fact that it's too off-beat to ever deem a particular genre. Horror? Drama? Comedy? Musical(certain parts throughout the film have Bale doing rather interesting things while listening to Genisis and other 80's bands)? I can't say without giving away much, so do I recommend it? Yes and no. Again the off-beatness makes it one of those fast-forward-certain-parts, scenes that are okay are really okay, and parts that aren't, well, aren't. Lets say for example you are one of those who liked the book - to let you know, your one of the fifty in the world that weren't mad at Bret Easton Ellis for making what woman-support groups called ""filth"" - then you might not like the book, it's a politial satire rather then slasher, a character focus rather then a character study and most importantly you can see the killings, they didn't exactly jump out of the page did they? Jered Leto, Willeum Dufoe and Reese Witherspoon have nice appearances."
"dfle3","6","0","7","19 June 2008"," Fortunately not as horrific as the novel extract I read
","Many years ago I read an extract in The Age newspaper of Bret Easton-Ellis' novel ""American psycho"". Didn't even manage to real all of it-I found it so absolutely vile I stopped reading it and knew that I would never read that book (the extract was the literary equivalent of coming across those photos from SBS TV autopsy shows in The Age-God knows why The Age feels that a TV guide needs shots of actual autopsies-again and again). The book then and now, presumably, requires it to be wrapped in a plain brown paper bag for taking away after purchase (as it's rated R).<br/><br/>Anyway, the other night a commercial network here in Australia screened this movie around midnight. I PVR'd it and watched it soon afterwards. I'm assuming that it wasn't different to the cinema release.<br/><br/>The plot: Christian Baile plays Patrick Bateman, a corporate high-flyer in the 1980's (with a touch of the Jim Carreys about him)- a time of corporate piracy and excess. He's about to get married, or so his girlfriend thinks and the petty jealousies at work fill him with such rage that he becomes quite the nasty psycho killer (Quest que cest?). This is the kind of slasher movie which has more in common with Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" than Carpenter's ""Halloween""-i.e. you get a fleshed out portrait of the murderer and not some automotan killing machine. As in those movies, it isn't really a gore-fest, though one or two scenes in it are not very pleasant-to do with dismemberment.<br/><br/>Apparently the novel was a biting satire of the excess of the times.That does come across in this movie, though I wonder if the book itself says more about the rivalry between artists (Easton Ellis) and the corporate world he seems to despise-in other words, perhaps the sickness of the novel says more about artists as a class than supposedly bad corporate raiders.<br/><br/>There are a couple of telling scenes in this movie where others precisely pigeon-hole Bateman and you know they've nailed his character.<br/><br/>Bateman is a very odd character-stylised and amusing at times."

Then there comes the ""uplift"" into meta psychology or philosophy. the final words. so, actually it's the question about life. Who am I?

He still just struggles like any other human being, because of not knowing weather it is right or wrong or even one of that, what you do in your life.

","The ending of the movie is really left open to interpretation, but I do believe there is a specific interpretation that the film maker wanted the audience to receive. I do believe that Patrick Bateman was imagining all of his murders. The first clue is when he drags Paul Allen's body out of his apartment building, blood trails behind- BUT, when it goes to the next screen shot there is no trail of blood. Also, have you ever noticed that his three friends can never find dinner reservations? I think it's because they don't actually exist. I think a lot of the scenarios he creates are in his head, but his whole world (and the people in it ex: Jane or his fiancé) isn't imaginative. Also, Paul Allen and Patrick's lawyer confront him about Patrick Bateman being a ""loser."" When Paul Allen does it you don't think anything of it because he is a superior to Bateman, but when the lawyer does it, it's questionable. The detective is obviously fake because he has so much in common with Bateman that it is unreal; also, the detective is never particularly suspicious of Bateman despite his suspicious actions. If you caught the first scene with the detective, he whips out a CD that Bateman obviously would have liked and referred to the music just as Bateman would. Bateman says he doesn't listen to music because he is freaked out by the similarities."

","American Psycho was not the worst piece of crap I have watched over the years, but it falls dangerously close to being in that category.<br/><br/>It is another well worn formula from writer Bret Easton Ellis, how rich Americans lose their soul in the pursuit of pleasure and material excess. It worked with Less Than Zero, but it doesn't work here.<br/><br/>Part of the reason is that Christian Bale is totally unconvincing as our 80's American Psycho. Whether he was miscast in the role or given bad direction, I don't know. He did not play a creep as true as, say a Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino. He more or less comes across as a Hollywood actor trying to play a crazy guy, and not pulling it off.<br/><br/>Moreover, the film seemed disjointed, like they had different strategies for what they were trying to accomplish. I could almost tell that certain shots were taken on the same day, and other shots taken on other days had a completely different feel. <br/><br/>It was also unclear to me if the murders were real or just imagined by our Patrick Bateman.

"locoxman56","10","0","2","30 January 2008"," Quite possibly the most important film ever made
","I'm 19 years old. The first time I saw the film was in the summer of 2006 when I was 18. Since that day Ihave approximately viewed American Psycho 25 to 30 times and every time I see it I am simply more and more mesmerized by this piece of film. I may only be 19 but I have seen my share of great films over the years(i.e. The Godfather, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Sling Blade, etc.) These films that I just mentioned along with a very select few are those rare films that have no flaws whatsoever. American Psycho is one of these films. After viewing a movie I like to think back and review each and every aspect of the film, what could have been better, what scenes could have been cut, etc. I didn't need but more than a few seconds to realize this film was absolutely flawless. American Psycho is hands down the best film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie with a friend of mind, he was also astonished at how brilliant this film was and told me what he heard about the novel by Bret Easton Elis. He heard that in the book there is much more detail and a lot of questions could be answered and there is much more graphic detail than the movie. I then purchased the novel and read it. And like the movie the book opened my eyes to a new world. The novel was quite controversial at the time written in 1991. The brilliance of the whole thing though is the adaptation from novel to film. Obviously some of the detail in the book could never be shown in theaters and was cut for like I said for obvious reasons. But every single character is played to perfection, some of the names are different in the movie thats not uncommon in movie and novel comparisons. The movie to me is the perfect length for what detail is need from the novel. If you haven't seen the movie read the book and I will guarantee that you appreciate the movie more regardless of your current view of the movie.<br/><br/>I had actually saw the movie Batman Begins before I had ever seen American Psycho and this was the first film in which I had seen Christian Bale.I viewed the movie and was blown away by Christian Bale's performance as this new aged Batman. So when I had heard about him playing the lead role in American Psycho I was very excited to find out if Bale was as talented as he was in BB. He was even better. I don't think I've ever seen a better performance by an actor in any movie. And after reading the novel it is even more amazing. When reading the Patrick Bateman lines in the novel, I could literally hear Christian Bale's voice in my head. Patrick Bateman is arguably the most complex fictional character every created. Not only is he misunderstood by most around him he also doesn't understand the significance of his own existence and for those who have seen the movie would recognize that you wouldn't even know that he feels this way by the way he acts around others. Patrick Bateman is 27 years old (in the novel he is 26) and works on Wall Street for a company called Pierce and Pierce. The extent of his job is actually not known as we see him just listening to music or watching TV while in his office. I don't want to give too many more details but Bateman his considered a ""yuppie"". Yuppies were considered to be the young , up and coming business men in the '80s. But if you have not seen this movie or not seen Christian Bale you are truly in for a thrill, this is not only in testament to the character Patrick Bateman but to the acting ability and talent of Christian Bale.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie at least 25 times and this is what I wish I could see in every film and this is one of the aspects that makes American Psycho so brilliant. It pretty much sucks you in. You can't help but want to know why certain things in the movie happened and you just will not be able to find the answers.<br/><br/>Performances by Willem Defoe, Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, and Jared Leto are mindbogglingly good. Willem Defoe plays Detective Donald Kimball and is at his absolute best even though he only appears in 3 scenes, those of you who have seen the movie can agree about why his performance is so excellent. Not too many people are huge Reese Witherspoon fans because of some of her recent disappointing roles but her role as Bateman's supposed fiancé Evelyn is second to none.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen American Psycho I suggest buying the DVD as opposed to renting it because you will most likely want to watch it a couple of more times. If you have seen the film I'm sure a lot of you might think I'm over the top by me saying that this is the best film ever made. One thing I forgot to mention is the humorous quality of the movie especially Patrick Bateman. This movie has so many different background stories, questions, and thoughts. But it is so important because of the world Patrick Bateman lives in. But what world does he want to live in? I think you might know the answer if you have seen the film.

"anduarto","6","0","1","15 January 2008"," Stylish thriller that ultimately doesn't add up
","This is one of the those movies I like less the more I think about it. I gave it a 7 shortly after I saw it. Not a great movie, a little gratuitous, but with a lot to recommend it. I boasts a top notch cast led by a compelling performance from Christian Bale. It's visually beautiful if at times grizzly. And, for those of us who survived the era, there's a certain perverse nostalgia for New York in the '80's. <br/><br/>Having slept on it, however, I had to come back today and pull my vote down to a 6. The strong parts remain, but the weak ones grow more blatant with reflection. I have two major complaints:<br/><br/>1) The portrayal of men in the movie is predictably dismal. They're all shallow and horrible and the movie is not without the faintest hint that the men only differ from the homicidal protagonist in the degree of their violence and contempt. I don't know many men like this. In a movie purportedly about the human psyche, such a skewed understanding of the ""norm"" is a substantial flaw.<br/><br/>2) Ultimately, it stretches credibility too far. How can he possibly get away with all this? Perhaps I missed something. There's a mistaken identity thread that runs through the movie, but even that doesn't seem sufficient to explain the movie's ultimate outcome. <br/><br/>If it wasn't for this site's obsession with ""spoilers', I could go into more detail, but many aspects - large and small - just don't ring true.<br/><br/>American Psycho is a stylish thriller worth seeing if only for the magnificent transformation of Bale. He is very good. But if you're looking for a deep probing of the human psyche - or even a plausible one - look elsewhere."
"johnmichael-2","8","0","2","5 January 2008"," Better than the book, but that's not saying much
","I love books, and I always think you should read a book before you watch the movie; or, if failing that, you should read the book sometime after. But, for the first time and probably the last time, I am telling you: if you want ""American Psycho"" skip the book ENTIRELY! This is a review of the movie, not the book, so I'll start with what the movie did right as opposed to what the book did wrong. Firstly, I'm glad Mary Harron directed this, because a woman is sometimes better able to satirize the egos and self-posturing of men simply because she isn't one; she has an objective viewpoint. In the first hour especially we see Patrick Bateman's weaknesses as he tries desperately to appear richer than his coworkers. He applies more lotions and creams than a stereotyped gay man, he actually cares whether his business cards looks better than those of his friends, and he is enraged with jealousy when he finds out that Paul Allen's apartment is even richer than his. ""I'm trying to fit it!"" he snaps at his girlfriend, Evelyn.<br/><br/>Who is this Paul Allen? He is one of the early victims of Patrick Bateman, murdered with an ax. Bateman, see, has a peculiarly strong bloodlust that is even stronger than his lust for music and opulence. He kills people an awful lot and really enjoys it. And he has not a scrap of remorse; the only emotions he can feel are greed and disgust.<br/><br/>The last half-hour, however, reveals the weakness of the source material. The ending in the book was a mishmash mess of epic proportions, and in following it the movie can only make it so much better. It is when the viewer realizes, though not as acutely as while reading the book, that a serial killer is such a stock character that no halfway-decent person can ever hope to portray accurately. Not even Christian Bale's great acting can fully dispel the fact that Bret Easton Ellis had no idea how to make a convincing antihero.<br/><br/>Now that we're on the subject of the book, here's my chance to explain how the film improved it. First of all, the book was just too long. It was endless in its descriptions of the yuppie lifestyle--so endless, in fact, that I felt I would kill myself if I ever saw the words ""Argyle socks"" or ""Ralph Saint-Laurent"" again. Thankfully, Mary Harron (and her co-writer Guinevere Turner) have condensed the first 100 pages of the novel into their appropriate 10 minutes. They have let Patrick's love for music show itself through the dialogue and acting rather than spending whole chapters' worth of material describing various bands. They also managed to introduce Detective Donald Kimball within 30 minutes when Ellis took 2/3 of the book to get there. While Ellis' horrid editor saw fit not to excise any of the endless tracks of puffed-up prose, the medium of film required it to be cut, and it was automatically an improvement.<br/><br/>Yet if Mary Harron improved the pacing and the satire, she didn't manage to improve the killing scenes. While Ellis committed the sin of going too far, she committed the sin of not going far enough. Since Ellis's style hinted at an ego bigger than Patrick Bateman, the pornographic scenes of fantastical murder were horrible to read--not at all disturbing, just plain ridiculous. But Mary Harron didn't go far enough; it was as if she was purposely trying to avoid the dreaded NC-17; though of course she got it anyway and had to cut 17 seconds from the threesome. And yet she could have gone a lot farther. She was doing a satire, not a puffed-up fantasy like Ellis, so a great deal of violence would have been a lot more excusable. I am not saying that more gore would have made the movie better; I'm saying that she needn't have handled the scenes so gingerly.<br/><br/>In all, a fair film. I think I would have appreciated it a bit more, however, if I had never read the book, because my hatred for Ellis' pile of crap did leak over a little into my movie experience. Which is why I'm telling you: if you want to experience ""American Psycho"", skip the book and go directly the movie. That's the first time you've heard me say that, and it'll probably be the last."
"illk9","9","0","1","3 December 2007"," Excellent Psycho Movie!! Excellent!!
","This movie is superb in so many ways. It is a must see for a lover of psycho movies as far as I'm concerned. You follow a man through a dark and disturbed series of events in which he shows no remorse. Also being a true serial killer his victims have very little in common. The only thing in common with some of them is the killer himself. In many cases there is no rhyme or reason for his victim's demise other than his personal pleasure.<br/><br/>He clearly has a competitive side which comes out several times, but once in particular when he is comparing business cards with colleagues. They are in public and clearly he can't stand and nearly can't cope with the outcome of the business card comparison. However in private Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is always in control. He has a very authoritative demeanor just before he kills and makes it look like a party. As if this would be a great time or a fantastic way to plan a weekend.<br/><br/>The movie has an excellent ending as well. Not your typical good guys win bad guys lose fantasy movie. I don't want to give anything away but I was pleasantly surprised it didn't have a fairytale ending. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a suspenseful, dark, disturbing, and violently bloody good time."
"ackstasis","7","0","2","29 November 2007"," ""I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""
","I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Bret Easton Ellis' novel, ""American Psycho,"" completely sickened me. It's a fascinating dark satire, but mostly for all the wrong reasons, with chapters of indescribably graphic sexual content and violence. If Ellis was aiming to receive a strong emotional response with his novel, then he certainly succeeded. I most definitely didn't enjoy it  in fact, I felt so uncomfortably filthy that I could hardly get to sleep  but he certainly knows which buttons to push. Thus, it was with some trepidation that I approached Mary Harron's 2000 film adaptation, which starred an up-and-coming Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, a murderous psychopath who finds himself caught up in the rampant materialism of the 1980s and early 1990s. Thankfully, and I say this with the greatest relief imaginable, the intense violence of the novel was toned down considerably for its translation to the screen, and, despite some weak direction in various scenes, Christian Bale's performance is positively awesome.<br/><br/>To look at him, you would never have guessed that Patrick Bateman was a disturbed serial killer. He is 27 years of age, handsome, intelligent, impeccably-stylish and holds a high-paying job at the respected Wall Street investment firm of Pierce & Pierce. He tries everything within his power to fit into society, but cannot suppress his distaste towards it, erupting into nightly sprees of blood-lust, during which he tortures and murders women and others who evoke his revulsion. Though we are not offered any concrete explanations for Bateman's psychosis, these acts of incredible violence appear to act as a distraction from the frustrating monotony of his 1980s yuppie lifestyle, and as a means of overcoming the intense feelings of inadequacy he harbours among his peers. Though Bateman candidly speaks of his horrific crimes on more than one occasion, the people around him are seemingly so absorbed in their chaotic, materialist lives that they hardly acknowledge his presence. In a stark indictment of American life, society is so busy comparing business cards, booking restaurant reservations, using recreational drugs and discussing fashion trivia that nobody even notices when one unhinged mad-man slaughters dozens of innocent people.<br/><br/>Less than a decade ago, Christian Bale was pretty much an unknown, having starred in a few notable films {such as Steven Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun (1987)'}, but nothing that would make him a household name. After a string of actors  Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio  showed a passing interest in the film's main role, the opportunity fell to Bale, who delivers an absolutely extraordinary performance, portraying the infamous Patrick Bateman as cool, calm and collected character on the surface. However, to the scenes of violence, he brings a frenzied intensity to the role that is both disturbing and darkly amusing. Bateman's cocky lectures on 1980s pop music, prior to each of his killing sprees, are delivered with relish. It's perhaps a good thing that the film's director, Mary Harron, was a female, otherwise much of 'American Psycho' might easily have been misconstrued as sexist. In actual fact, the film always stops short of glorifying its gruesome protagonist, following his exploits with obvious disapproval and repulsion.<br/><br/>Now we come to the most fascinating question posed by the film: how much of what Bateman does may we accept as reality? In the novel, Bret Easton Ellis cleverly keeps the answer to this completely ambiguous, offering scattered hints that support each of the possibilities. In media interviews, director Mary Harron has stated that she had always intended for Bateman's murders to be completely real, though I think that this is where her direction was a bit weak; I'll wager that almost everybody who hasn't read the book finished the film with the belief that Bateman had imagined all the killings. The final scene, in which Harold Carnes (Stephen Bogaert) claims to have recently had dinner with one of Bateman's victims, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), was handled quite well, since we already know that, throughout the film, it is commonplace for characters to mistake each other for somebody else {indeed, at the start of that very conversation, Carnes refers to Bateman as ""Davis""}. The scene of which I am not quite so enthusiastic is Bateman's revisit to Paul Allen's residence, where he finds a perfectly-clean apartment and a real estate agent. In the novel, it was written in a way that made the reader wonder ""why has the real estate company covered up the horrific murders?"" In the film, we're left without any doubt that Bateman is delusional."

","I saw this movie about 2 years ago from a friend who, in retrospect, to a certain degree patterned his life after patrick bateman.<br/><br/>The title is certainly misleading to some who might think this is a horror/slasher flick. and while it may have a bit of blood, it is more on the order of a socio/psychological character study on what happens to an elitist nobody trying to fit in, and never quite fitting in.<br/><br/>Now, i can't speak for the book that it is based on as i have not read it. however it does certainly stand on it's own two feet.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely remarkable remaking the 80's yuppie scene. the music, the clothes, the attitudes of the young urban professional trust fund babies is so well done, that it is too good to be a caricature.<br/><br/>Movies like this that are so good rarely need to have long diatribes written about them as they will most certainly speak for themselves, so i will leave this review with two more points.<br/><br/>Point one, this movie should be taken somewhat introspectively. don't just watch it and then put it away on the shelf or return it to your choice of rental establishment. think about it. think about what happened, why it happened. it is an intelligent film. somewhat artsy at times, but nothing that is so esoteric that you have to be an initiate to understand what happened.<br/><br/>Point two. if you do enjoy this movie and you decide to learn more about it and the person who had written it, you will inevitably find out that he also wrote ""rules of attraction"" (in fact james van der beak played batemans younger brother in that movie, although it wasn't spoken about...). be forewarned that if you do enjoy this movie and go out of your way to see ""rules of attraction"", don't expect to see the same kind of depth. in fact, don't see it at all because it was a waste of time.<br/><br/>Now if you will excuse me, i have to go and return some video tapes..."

","Think of this as a very witty, dark, psychotic look at the 1980's in New York City. We follow a group of young money makers, especially one individual (a very talented Christian Bale), through the daily, income creating, label wearing, name dropping, reservation making life of empty objects, hollow relationships, and rich mental lives. The story has some twists to it, so I want to be careful here, but prepare yourselves for a film that makes you want to laugh and vomit at nearly the same moment. You will definitely appreciate Bale's acting, along with a nicely subdued Chloe Sevigny, a typical fritzy Reese Witherspoon, and a dogged detective played Willem Defoe. This is a VERY black comedy thriller, with lots of sex and violence, and cultural visions focused on our brand of consumerism. It's not a pretty sight, but it IS disturbingly funny."

This is one of those movies you have to watch to really understand, but at the same time you may not understand it even after watching it the first time. I think it requires a second viewing to really get a feel for it and also to do it justice. The music that he plays during some of the killings is just hilarious -- not the type of music you would be thinking about if you were about to kill someone! The ending of this movie is fantastic! I won't spoil that for you, but I loved it! The only thing bad I can say is that I thought it was too long at 101 minutes.

Well, surprisingly, the film is more or a dark comedy than a horror.<br/><br/>The kills were not squeamish. Yeah, they were kind of violent, but not in a crude way. They were played like a satire so you really do not feel mad or disgusted by any content of this movie (expect maybe for some random sex scenes).<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this film was the uneven pacing. Sometimes the movie passes really fast and sometimes it halts for a slow scene. It wasn't a huge deal, though. Christian Bale's performance is really different from what I've seen from other films of his. It may be in a good or bad way. I don't know.

","Christian Bale plays a MARVELOUS psycho. In this movie his American accent is nearly flawless (if overdone a bit in spots); the tics, the facial expressions, everything - outstanding!

There wasn't a single other character that stood out. Everybody else could have been played by ANY-body else.<br/><br/>The movie really started to fall apart for me when the shooting spree began. It just went nowhere, and fizzled out in a damp corner. I was left unsatisfied.<br/><br/>I will say that I liked the chainsaw interlude, I liked that Jean gets out alive, and I will say again that Christian Bale was fantastic in his loony rage - bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, spewing sometimes but only an implied threat at other times. He did well.<br/><br/>Suggestions I would have made? - I think Luis should have had a special torturous death waiting for him, detective Kimball should have almost-but-not-quite bought it at the end, and Patrick should have died a gloriously gore-ific death.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth seeing, but only because Bale did such a good job. The directing was interesting (up until things went kerflooey...almost like an intern took over the script and directing when the shoot-out began), but I was basically struggling to see what so many others have seen before they sung the praises of this movie.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 because of Bale, -2 because the movie fell apart."

","First off, know I laughed the entire movie. And when I wasn't laughing I was covering my gaping smile with my hands.<br/><br/>If only every movie Bale did was this awesome. He brought that dark/sexy/maniacal/obsessed role to an apex. Nicholson's crazy in the Shining, but Bale is the best f'n crazy guy ever! I'm not gay, but I would totally let him give me a speech on shitty pop music, boss me around, then, I don't know, take a nail gun to the back of my head. Jesus, this movie was fun.<br/><br/>The lampooning of the whole '80s excess' point was exercised excitingly and was bitingly hilarious. Notwithstanding the business card scene or the opening monologue, there are smaller, i feel more significant, parts that really twist the darkly comedic knife a little more: 1) He is finally alone in his office (after the high-power setup) and he turns the TV on and its 'the price is right'. end scene. hilarious.<br/><br/>2) Once the movie picks up more and you know the dude's psycho, he goes out to eat and there's this little inner monologue where he gets so mortified that you think someone that he's killed is stapled to the ceiling but the ""flood"" of anxiety is because he was unsure about the availability of seating at the restaurant. also, equally, hilarious.<br/><br/>More so, there was excellently selective directing. It was beautiful and taut, with a great Edward scissor-hands-esquire feeling of a fantasy world (i.e., dragging a bag clearly full of 'body' past the front door man, i.e., the whole damn movie). everything works so well in its unbelievability and graveness that once the movie is on its way, it stops being an issue and allows the viewer to simply enjoy the film.<br/><br/>To further toot Bale's horn, it seems like the rest of the cast could have been Popsicle sticks hung by fishing line in every scene because he TRULY did make this movie. It kind of makes you try to think of other movies that were so good because of the main character's portrayal. And if Leonardo DiCaprio took the role, heaven forbid, it would have been such a misplaced decision that 'American Psycho' could have been another 'Basketball Diaries' (because, hey, didn't he look like a twelve year old junkie?). Great casting.<br/><br/>And don't get me started about the clearly audible, yet somehow indistinct, comments he makes to people about his psychosis (See ""murders and executions, mostly""; ""i like to dissect girls""; ""I need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale""). All of that was almost too much to bear.<br/><br/>All in all, this is such a fantastic film that has proved difficult to talk about in public because whether imitating or discussing, people look at you like you are a sick piece of sh*t.<br/><br/>What could be better?"

Christian Bale as I have read many other users comment previously, is magnificent in the role of the film's main character, as he has been in several films since, seems to play the nut-case/tormented genius rather well.<br/><br/>Where American Psycho does, perhaps, fall away somewhat is in maintaining the audiences attention and enthusiasm past half-way through the film.

","Impressive adaptation of the brutal satire detailing early 90's yuppie excess, Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel comes to sparkling life with equal measures of hilarity and depravity. In ripping the often referenced book for a cinematic reincarnation, director Mary Harron certainly had her work cut out for her. Substituting some of the unbearably graphic images which would fester inside readers heads for a more suggestive style, Harmon brilliantly recreates this hard-edged satire for the silver screen with very few discrepancies.<br/><br/>Thriving off of the psychotically committed effort from lead Christian Bale, American Psycho might not be as bluntly effective as some of it's harsher passages would beckon, but nonetheless remains one of modern Hollywood's most brilliant and scorching satires on the materialistic excess plaguing the late 80's early 90's for many ambitious Americans. It is that memorable time period that is captured so convincingly amidst Bateman's psychotic urges that makes the film larger then it's subject. Many will classify American Psycho as a horror film on the warped mindset behind a serial killer, though it becomes clear by film's end that a sharply cutting comedic commentary on those highly egotistical years play more of a role in describing what makes this violent and sadistic man tick then expected.<br/><br/>In turn, American Psycho becomes a glorious dark comedy, even if a little repetitious, whilst Bale continues to terrify audiences with his disturbingly perfect portrait. It is a character definitely prone to caricature, completely convincing in the rare evil silences we witness when Bales becomes engulfed in his struggling darkness, which viewers will, upon further viewings, analyze further due to an ambiguous ending. Though short of the character study masterpiece I had ideally hoped for, the film will remain a nihilistic joy with stinging psychological sentiment for years to come."

","My first question after belatedly watching American Psycho is this: why isn't Christian Bale more revered? Every time I have seen him in a film he has been excellent, and as Patrick Bateman he was nothing short of electric. The film itself made a valiant stab at capturing the essence of the novel whilst also structuring it as a workable movie for the casual viewer, and was never going to be as jaw-dropping as the book. However, a top class cast and some shrewd writing and directorial decisions delivered a film that was better than I expected it to be, and Bale's mesmerising Bateman made sense of the pointlessness of his actions, creating a monster that needs no back-story  he is simply what he is and does what he does because he wants to. This lack of cohesive motive actually works in his favour and it was nice to see no compromise ending. Good film."

","""American Psycho"" is a difficult film to review because one, it's never clear whether or not the events in the film are real, or are just a figment of Patrick Bateman's (Christian Bale) warped imagination. It's deliberately never stated and is something that is best left up to the viewer to decide. The Bret Easton Ellis novel from which this film is based, caused a stir upon its 1991 publishing, which satirized yuppie culture, Reaganomics-gone-amok, and crass materialism during the 1980s.<br/><br/>As it would turn out, Bateman, a successful Wall Street investment banker, finally decides to give into an insatiable blood-lust that begins with the cold-blooded murder of a homeless man, followed by a colleague (Jared Leto), and an assortment of call girls and prostitutes. Why Bateman does these horrific things without provocation, purpose or explanation, is all part of the film's bizarre appeal and is not just for shock value.<br/><br/>Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich in ""Scream"") rhetorically asked why did Hannibal Lecter eat people? Why did Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers slash up promiscuous teenagers in their respective film series? So why does Patrick Bateman butcher prostitutes in his apartment? Maybe because he's a pretty sick guy? Who knows. All this can be debated for hours on end in a criminal behavior class (for which I'm reviewing this as part of an assignment) about Bateman's motivations.<br/><br/>Bateman does not fit the profile of any known serial murderer before him. He's educated, wealthy, respected by his co-workers, and has a well-preserved body to kill for (no pun intended). So why does he one night, out of the blue, decide to chop a guy's face in two with an ax? Nobody knows, but my theory is that he just does it for because he has an unquenchable blood-lust that he suddenly feels the impulse to give into. To the world at large, however, he retains his businessman persona. To his fiancée (Reese Witherspoon), he's an all right if not somewhat shallow guy to want to be engaged to. He's also very sensible: he's often the one to straighten out his colleagues when they make a**es of themselves in public by making racially insensitive remarks.<br/><br/>""American Psycho"" takes a shockingly funny and horrific look at Bateman's twisted reality, all without the safety of a net. Director Mary Harron looks at the Wall Street world of male bravado, closet homosexuality, materialism, and masculinity without a single flinch. (Is there anything more blatantly homo-erotic than comparing the print on business cards?) When we look at this world, we wonder: Did the '80s really look like this? Did an insane Wall Street investment banker go on a naked rampage, chasing a hooker out of his apartment with a chainsaw?<br/><br/>Perhaps they did (I was too young to remember), but Ellis certainly remembered, and caught considerable flak from it. That Bateman is able to wonder why his murder spree goes unpunished, why he can't inflict his inner pain onto an uncaring world and why a detective named Kimball (Willem Dafoe) doesn't think to ask him harder questions about his nocturnal activities, all escape him, and us. ""American Psycho"" is a confusing, funny, and oft-shocking expose of a world that is best forgotten in history, but will still be nonetheless fascinating to criminal justice and psychology majors until the end of time.<br/><br/>10/10"

He knows which exfoliating creams his face needs and which water-proof bath gel works best for him. He does a thousand crunches a day and gets himself artificial tanning and regular manicures. With this level of self-love, comes an overpowering sense of narcissism and the insatiable desire to get attention. Obsessively name-dropping, sporting the most desirable brands, and being seen at some of the most exclusive places is most of what Bateman and his ilk do. As the life of conspicuous consumption carries on, we see his conversations becoming trite, relationships losing any meaning, and quick ways of getting high taking precedence. Most of Patrick Bateman's social interaction are shown as awkward and understandably so, as a person as self-involved as him will not be able to carry on a normal conversation with anyone.<br/><br/>Things slowly start getting out of hand as his craving for attention turns into uber-competitiveness that turns lethal for those involved. The hunger for highs, the callousness from having all luxuries one can ask for, and a lack of purpose push Bateman into a darker world where he prowls the night soliciting prostitutes and potential slashing victims. Things slowly take a turn for the fantastic as ATMs start demanding feline offerings and random people getting shot by the dozen. After a certain point, it doesn't even matter whether these things happened. And it is at this level where the film works its magic.<br/><br/>There is a distinct quality of surrealism throughout the film. In this topsy-turvy world, people talk in a strange tongue and give importance to the oddest things. The symbolic and satirical tone of the film works perfectly, and it seems like there wasn't another way that would have worked. The extremes shown in the film do efficiently what a more direct way couldn't have. This is certainly not one of the easiest films to watch or appreciate. But to say that it serves only to shock you would be doing disservice to it. It doesn't preach and instead shows us the despicable psychopath that lives in a small corner within all of us."
"p_adkins2004","7","0","3","23 January 2007"," Bateman is the only sane character.
","The novel, by Bret Easton Ellis, of which this film is based on is outstanding. Horrorific, darkly funny and completely entrapping it is a modern classic, and a great statement about the yuppie culture - so I had high standards for this film.<br/><br/>Bale as Bateman was not how I envisioned the character, despite being a Bale fan I probably would have said he was mis-cast. Although he gets the charismatic and yuppie side of Bateman down to a t, the dark psychotic and broody side of Bateman is portrayed in the same over-acted manner.<br/><br/>The film, thank god, does not choose to 'Hollywood' the novel, with the viewer still being left with an ambiguous ending, in which one must decide how much of the events actually happened and what was in Bateman's fantasy or delirium, it is never clear as it is both hinted at the he did everything and nothing - which is great. By doing this the film manages to portray the book's clear statement on reasons and not the means.<br/><br/>Interestingly, despite being called 'Psycho' the film manages to portray one of the book's best factors - the interesting point that perhaps in Bateman is the only sane man. In the Yuppie culture and circles Bateman runs with, he is the only one with enough self-awareness to realise that the life they live is hollow, meaningless and futile - thus creating his blood lust.<br/><br/>This film scratches the surface at what the book means and is no where near as dark, but for a 100 minute film it succeeds far more than I thought it would. Bale makes an admirable effort, and yet despite the flicks clear downfalls, there lies a enthralling and thought provoking film."

","I understand that instead of the Texas Chainsaw, Friday the 13th or Halloween type insaneness, the movies gone out to try and be clever. But maybe, just maybe it was a bit too clever. The title leads you to think you're in for a real gore-fest type massacre when really it's nothing like that at all. You have to stay on the ball and thinking throughout and that's not really what those kind of people like to be do. So I can see it losing a few fans there. Secondly for the people who do like to combine intelligence with gore, it may have taken the intelligence thing it has going a bit far, thus confusing people. No doubt there will be those people in the middle who it was just right for and that's great. But the question that must be asked is, is there a high enough percentage of those people? <br/><br/>Personally, I was unsatisfied at the end. But it's the type of movie that if you took 5 people who'd just seen the movie, sat them down and asked them what they thought, they'd probably all give you a different opinion. Christian Bale truly is great in it, so no matter what I'd recommend giving it a go."

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Relatively speaking, that is.<br/><br/>This is an interesting, if a bit over the top, portrait of a psychopath gone bananas. Presented in white, white, and more white so that the red, red, red of the blood will be all the more contrasting, this approach coincides with the ultra, ultra sophistication of the Harvard and Yale grads working on Wall Street who are so, so very venal and superficial. This is a slasher film that will appeal equally to heartlanders on a date night, and to those blue coasters who need a little titillation.<br/><br/>(And then suddenly Bateman takes over my review): Yeah, RIGHT. Who cares.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't usually watch slasher films, being above that kind of stuff, but this is stylishly done--and I do like style in my blood splattering. Where director Mary Herron screws up is in not realizing that only an idiot sociopath would be so stupid and self-destructive as to so carelessly kill so many people. If there is one thing a sociopath never wants to do is to bring pain upon himself. Don't you think, considering the ending, that Bateman is going to be caught? Huh? (Resuming control of my review and droning on): ...although the terms ""sociopath"" and ""psychopath"" are often used interchangeably, there is a clear tendency for ""psychopath"" to be reserved for violent sociopaths. Another reason ""psychopath"" is correct is because this is a postmodern update of the classic Hitchcock slasher movie Psycho (1960) starring...<br/><br/>(Again taking over): Shut up. Who cares who it starred? The point here is that this film--we're talking about MY film-- is a TOTALLY INACCURATE portrait of a true psycho--I mean sociopath. We don't make ourselves so vulnerable to the Criminal Justice System. We are NOT intent on self-destruction. Believe me if I ever decide to get my jollies by slashing someone up, I will make absolutely sure I can get away with it. Only low IQ psychos like Scott Peterson get caught. And, by the way, what is with this chainsaw business? I mean he tosses it down the stairwell so that it crashes on the floor from how many stories above, and it still works so he can use it on ""Christie""? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Oh. You think that it hit her while still running, huh? Ha, ha, ha! Nice shot, dude.<br/><br/>(Again resuming control): ..notice too that the ending allows for a sequel, yet has all the trappings of an ending. We know that he is going to be caught and yet...<br/><br/>(Coming back out of the screen...): We know nothing. The cops are stupid. Nobody will believe...<br/><br/>(Shoving him back in...): ...the emphasis on the conspicuous consumption of expensive food and wine, drugs, cigars, the indulgence of any kind of animal pleasure is, on one level a statement about our society--well, Wall Street society--but on another level is part of the usual Hollywood seduction of the audience. This is the fast lane. Wouldn't you like to live in the fast lane for a bit, but of course come back (after they run the credits) to your own way of life? Isn't this the essence of escape? Go to the movies, rent a DVD, kick up your feet and escape for awhile, and maybe there will be a catharsis, as the Greek tragedians intended. And when you turn off the set and go to bed you realize that nothing in your life is so extreme and nothing in your life is really that far gone, and yet you have experienced vicariously an extreme emotion, and as a bonus you can feel superior to those Ivy League sickos.<br/><br/>In truth this is a slightly tongue in cheek slasher/serial killer flick. It's a satire of sorts. It is as slick as slick can be, thoroughly engrossing with fine acting from especially Christian Bale who plays Bateman. The direction is as tight as a well-strung banjo, the script nearly hypnotic in its seductive power, the New York ultra hip sets eye-widening as seeing the Taj Mahal while the sidebar-like satirical commentary, which (on a third level) parodies the genre, is very funny. Best joke: they're in the restroom of a fancy eating establishment and doing some lines and the guy in the next stall gets a little uptight because they're loud and screams out, ""Will you keep it down. I'm trying to do drugs!"" Also funny is how Bateman says what he really thinks and nobody takes him seriously, and how he slips up from time to time and nobody notices.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Reese Witherspoon has a minor part as exactly the kind of clueless woman who might very well marry a psychopath. I liked this touch because I have known a few non-violent sociopaths and I often wondered if their spouses had a clue. Clearly Reese's character did not.<br/><br/>Also excellent in support was Chloe Sevigny as Jean, Bateman's adoring (but also clueless) secretary. The idea here is that women are so bowled over by Bateman's alpha male credentials that they can't see the real person. The only character to really realize who Bateman was (and she ended up listening to that knowledge a little late) was the streetwalker. Well, Jean gets the picture finally as she peruses Bateman's graphic notebook. (By the way, somebody got paid to draw all the stuff in it. I wonder who that was. Was there a mention in the credits, something like, sick psycho doodlings by...?) Finally: real life irony. The character that Bale played in a movie immediately before this one was Jesus of Nazareth in a TV drama called Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999). As Casey Stengel used to say, you could look it up."

","Let me be up front and say I am not sure I understood this film. It appears to be a dual of Taxi Driver, the self-proclaimed elite of this movies conflicts in a strange way with the self-hating Bickle of Scorsese's masterpiece. However, they are both people to be loathed by the common man. The character in the film starts to view himself as Neitzche's superman, I believe. Excess takes him over; the film is purely set in an 80's context for this reason. He is part of the ""Me"" generation, but this ""me"" leads him to kill. It is only he that matters. But I am puzzled with what led him to be that way. I prefer films that at least make some effort to discuss how a character came to be; rather than just placing an artificial construct in front of the film and expecting us to sympathize. The movie isn't bad per se, but you get the sense that the main character is there just to shock...<br/><br/>ZooTrouble"

","I long have had this movie on my mental list of things to see. I was expecting something totally different.<br/><br/>The movie in essence is a parody of the modern American businessman, especially those in the financial and trading businesses in New York. The lead is Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman, good looking, fit, but shallow, really empty, inside. A really funny scene has men comparing business cards, and at the end Bateman can only see murder of the one with the best card as a way of saving face.<br/><br/>There's quite a list of good actors here -- Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Chloë Sevigny (as Bateman's secretary), Reese Witherspoon (as Bateman's fiancée), Jared Leto, and Willem Dafoe as Donald Kimball, the detective trying to solve the disappearance of one of Bateman's co-workers.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. We see Bateman murdering co-worker Allen because his were the most impressive business cards. He hires hookers, has fun with them, and murders them. In one scene we see several bodies in a closet, wrapped in clear plastic. But in the end when he tells his attorney he has killed Allen, and many others, the attorney says that's impossible, I had lunch with Allen in London just recently. And, near the end we see a character that supposedly was murdered. So how much of it was in his mind? Maybe it doesn't matter, his whole fixation on himself was his psychosis."

Can someone explain that? When he goes into that other guy's apartment and it's for sale and totally scrubbed clean? I didn't get this dialog between Bateman and the real estate lady or why there weren't cops and police tape all over the crime scene...What am I missing there? As far as his lawyer calling him Davis and saying that he had seen the dead man recently in London, that was funny and when the whole thing clicked for me, but I am still wondering what the heck was up with that apartment scene.

","American Psycho is one of my all time favorite books. That being said, the movie left me highly disappointed. One thing I've learned over the years is that if you've read a book and really enjoyed it, you will ultimately be disappointed by the movie adaptation. The book is highly disturbing and for some sick and twisted reason, highly comical.<br/><br/>When reading the book, I got the impression that it was intended to be a dark comedy. I could have been wrong and was just laughing at things when I shouldn't have been, but the movie didn't really have a whole lot that made me laugh. The movie was just lacking in spirit. I am a big fan of Christian Bale, but his character seemed a little too robotic, much like his character in Equilibrium.<br/><br/>The movie just didn't live up to the legacy of the book. Had I not read the book first, I probably would have enjoyed the movie more. That being said, anyone who has seen and enjoyed the movie, go read the book.

","I read the book a few months ago after learning that it stirred up controversy when it was first published in '91. Complaints from feminist groups said that it painted a bad picture of women in the '80s, so the publisher dropped it and the author was force to take it elsewhere. The movie can boast no such controversial reputation simply because it doesn't hold a candle to the book. In the book, Bateman kills dozens of people in horrific ways. In the movie, he kills only four people (not including the rampage at the end where he kills an additional seven, arguably) and none of the deaths are especially graphic, when compared to the book. But I guess you have to be a reader to understand why the book didn't translate too well on film, but the fact is, most don't."

Christian Bale is fantastic in this, he is the film's credit. There are lots of scenes in the film that are very tame compared to the book, I read the book a few years earlier and it is..... terrifying, scary, macabre!! The film has a softer edge, with a lot of the violence from the book not used in the film it makes me wonder if a German or other European filmmaker made it would it be more true to the book? When it comes to the end of the film and he has committed all these murders you want there to be a great ending, which it doesn't quite have.

"Kiernaan","10","0","1","9 October 2005"," Perfect!
","This movie has it all. An atmosphere, great satire, violence, and replay value (for me anyways).<br/><br/>The acting by Bale is superb of course. No one else could be casted for this role by a long shot. The tone in his voice is completely jerk-filled and you want to give him a high five every time he acts like the way he does. <br/><br/>Through some well shot scenes, a good score and good acting, this movie managed to accurately display an exaggerated 80s Reagan era society. There are so many good lines that add to the cockiness of Bateman that it makes you smirk every time. I especially liked the dinner table scene where he talks about ending apartheid, world hunger, and stress less materialism, etc. but he obviously doesn't care about any of this. He just cares about being the epitome of knowledge...as well as looks, money, and being psychotic as well!<br/><br/>I really don't see why the ending was such a problem for people. It's obvious it really happened. If it didn't, it would make the movie's message a complete failure. Why I think it really happened:<br/><br/>1. Everyone uses each other's names. Everyone looks the same. Therefore, there is much confusion to which each person really is. Paul Allen confuses Bateman for another character and it goes like this for everyone. Also, every man is cheating with everyone else's girlfriend. It creates this cycle of lost identity. <br/><br/>2. The detective says Bateman was at dinner, so he couldn't have killed Paul Allen at the end. Obviously this is another case of what I discussed in the first point. Stolen identity.<br/><br/>3. The violence was another extension of the satire. To make it over the top and completely out of control indulgence, why not add murder to the mix? If Bateman can get away with anything because he's the king of everything, why not it be murder as well? It's a great mix really.<br/><br/>I also do not get the book vs the movie comparison failures. Yes, this is a movie, so no, they can't devote a complete hour to discussing the band Genesis, only a segment. Lets cry about it. The movie wasn't as over the top, OK well, you again have only so much time in a movie. Also, lets not take into consideration the ratings that fly with this extra violence. To me, it is harder to accurately convey Bateman and his over the top behavior with less violence, yet this film achieved it. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but the movie is an adaption, and a perfect one at that. It is its own world.<br/><br/>To top it off, the fact that Bateman couldn't cope with no consequences for his over the top actions was pretty great. Like many serial killers, they leave clues to try and get caught. What if you walked into the police office as one and they laughed in your face? From a serial killer point of view, I'm sure it would make your time a complete waste. So overall, his consumerism, materialism, intelligence, greed, murder, reached its climax and the only end result he would have liked was punishment, but now he has to live with this and he can't take it. He can't go any deeper with his escapades. <br/><br/>I'm sure for a character like Bateman's, the only end would result in suicide so you would have to abruptly end this as did the book if you want to keep it going in the satire world."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","1","24 September 2005"," ""Don't touch the watch."" (spoilers throughout)
","I guess one of the main debating points when it comes to American Psycho is whether the murders are reality or fantasy. Before I read the book I was firmly of the opinion that everything was in Bateman's head. But after reading the novel and watching the film again I'm not so sure that you can definitively tell either way. After all, the whole point of the film seems to be that Bateman exists in a society that is so overwhelmingly self-absorbed that it doesn't even listen when he's begging to be caught. No one believes him and no one really cares. So if everyone turns a blind eye to the excesses of the rich, how can we tell whether he really did anything? <br/><br/>Another factor that clouds matters is the way that everyone confuses the identity of the people they associate with. Bateman gets confused for other people, he pretends to be other people and no one seems to have a clue who they're really talking to. It's a nice little dig at the conformity of the 80s  people are homogeneous. But it also ensures that we can never be truly sure whether everything is reality or fantasy. At the end of the film Bateman talks to his lawyer, but his lawyer doesn't even know who he is. Yet his lawyer apparently had dinner with one of the people he killed. But seeing as people are continually lying, name-dropping and making mistakes, how can we be sure of the truth of this? On the one hand Bateman could be lunatic with murderous fantasies, but on the other he could be a psychotic murderer trapped in a personal hell where no one believes him and where there's no one to put him out of his misery.<br/><br/>Either way I think the film is a resounding success, much more so than the book. The book is pretty good but it's self-indulgent and excessive. And while that's the point  the 80s were shallow, get it?  I can only take so many descriptions of suits before I want to hurl the book across the room. ""He was wearing a"" Plus the film gets rid of most of the gory killings. And while I'm sure there were a few nutters out there that got themselves riled up about that, focusing more on the satire of things benefits the film immensely.<br/><br/>But however you interpret the reality of the film, the message is really the same: contrary to Huey, conformity is bad. A couple of times Bateman says that he wants to fit in, but in actuality he has nothing but contempt for the people he works with. All the time he's competing, trying to outdo people with his business card, his suit or his haircut, but no one even knows who he is. He's not really a person. So his anger at being a non-person that's overlooked and outdone spills over into murder or fantasies of murder. It's one of the few releases he has.<br/><br/>Sex is another release. The scene with the prostitutes is hilarious. It's more like masturbation than anything. For foreplay he demonstrates his understanding of Phil Collins and during the act itself he's continually looking at himself and narcissistically flexing his muscles. It's the American Dream, baby  sex, a buff body, hookers and, er, 'Sussudio'.<br/><br/>But on the subject of the music, I like the Whitney Houston speech even more. I love how emotional he gets  it's like he's reciting some pretentious music review he's read  and I like the way that you cut from his tears to him having vigorous sex with a drugged woman.<br/><br/>But speaking of Bateman's speeches, I also like the way he quotes restaurant reviews. There's no original thought at all. He's just a suit, a haircut and a lot of second hand knowledge and opinions. The latter is best illustrated in the Espace scene where he gives off a long speech about how America as a society has to return to traditional values. The audience is well aware of the irony, but Bateman isn't.<br/><br/>But Bateman's a perfect embodiment of Reagan's America. He's fearful of homosexuals, hateful towards the underclass (""Why don't you get a job, Al?"") and he earnestly spouts empty platitudes (""Just say no"") while taking lots of drugs and having lots of sex. He's a hypocrite and a liar but he's 100% all-American.<br/><br/>And like some American males he has a strange idea of masculinity. He's a misogynist, a racist and he's oversexed, but he pampers himself like a woman. But although he takes a lot of care over his body, his mind is left to rot. But then again when you're a privileged young man whose work consists of going to lunch, reading Playboy and listening to 'Lady in Red', perhaps your mind is best left well alone (maybe his choice in music is what drives him to insanity  listen to Collins and DeBurgh and be damned forever). But I also like his childish need to impress. If only he could get into Dorsia And I also love Bale's reaction in the scene where one of the prostitutes asks him how much his apartment cost. He snaps that it's none of her business but then smugly says that it cost a lot. Along with Whitney Houston, it's the funniest moment in the film.<br/><br/>And it's the humour that makes the film worth repeated viewings. Sure there's a lot of fun in trying to work whether it's real or not (is his blowing up the police car a lucky shot or a fantasy? And is 'feed me a stray cat' merely a delusion or is it a delusion brought about by the killing rampage he's engaged in?) but I keep coming back for lines like, ""Huey's too black sounding for me."" <br/><br/>Now if you don't mind, I've got to return some videotapes"

The business card scene was just great! I skipped through the two commentaries and both seemed to be decent but I didn't really care for the featurettes much.

","American Psycho is an amazing movie. It is a brilliant satire. The acting is amazing especially by Christian Bale. When you strip this movie down it is not about a serial killer. The movie has a much different and deeper meaning. In American Psycho, the dark 80's satire the message is very clear. In the 80's all the Wall Street Yuppies are the same. They only care about themselves. They all want to be perfect. Since none of them present their own personalities it is hard to distinguish them. This is why everyone confuses everyone else for other people. These people aren't all friends. They are all just using each other to get ahead. Patrick Bateman does not even know who he is. He questions his very existence. That is the first aspect of this film. The second thing is Patrick Bateman did indeed commit the murders. The only person who remotely cared about the murders was Detective Kimball. All of Patrick's friend's alibis said that he was there when in fact he wasn't. This is another example of mistaken identity. Nobody seems to care that Patrick murders. He makes it so clear to everyone but they are all just so occupied with their own lives that they don't care. At its core this movie is very similar to Wall Street. The point of this film isn't to show a serial killer killing people. It is to show that in the 80's on Wall Street most people were just obsessed with getting ahead and they didn't care about anything else. Patrick is just so annoyed with this normal lifestyle that he goes absolutely crazy and starts killing people. He already had problems to begin withyet a few things trigger him off and he goes crazy. He murders people because he wants to do something different he wants to be different from everyone else. Everyone he knows is the same type of person. That is the reason for all the mistaken identities. Although when no once even acknowledges his murders it drives him more crazy. This is why at the end he says "" My punishment has eluded me"" meaning his punishment escapes him. He will never be punished because no one really acknowledged that he killed these people. Then he says ""My confession has meant nothing"" meaning his confession didn't mean anything because no one cared. <br/><br/>Well anyways I think I got the meaning of this movie right. I loved this movie. The acting is incredible. Especially Christian Bale."

","Of course I already had heard of this movie before, but it took me until today to finally give it a try. I knew that this was a movie about a serial killer and in my opinion there is no movie with such a subject that reaches the high standard that once has been set by ""The Silence of the Lambs"". But it was my brother who told me that I shouldn't hesitate. He's an absolute fan of this movie and he was convinced that I would like it too.<br/><br/>During the day time Patrick Bateman appears to be a normal young man working on wall street at his father's company. But he has a dark secret. At night he turns into a homicidal maniac who likes to kill for fun. He doesn't really need a reason to murder, but it always helps when he is extremely envious of for instance his fellow co-workers. But he also murders out of pure hatred or complete insanity. Gradually his insanity increases, making him kill more than 20 people, ranging from models to homeless people, co-workers, friends, and anyone else who stands in his way. The only person that seems to be save for him is his secretary Jean, although she too almost becomes one of his victims. But is all this actually true, has it really all happened or is it just a product of his imagination, a psychotic delusion. No-one really knows, certainly not Patrick Bateman...<br/><br/>I guess there are two ways of seeing this movie. You can either see it as a pure slasher movie full of gore or you can see it as a satirical thriller that tries to show how empty and shallow society can be. I prefer the second opinion, as it is clear to me that Patrick Bateman may well be a typical yuppie from the eighties, but still feels relevant today. Murders still happen and many people still don't seem to care all that much about it, as there are always enough people who will never be missed by anyone.<br/><br/>In the end, this certainly isn't a perfect movie. There are just too many imperfections in the story for that. It's for instance a bit slow and sometimes you don't really have the feeling that the movie is telling anything that you haven't seen a few minutes earlier. But it's thanks to the wonderful performance of Christian Bale that I'm willing to forget about that. What he did with the role of Bateman can't really be improved by any other actor. He's absolutely stunning in his role and was by far the best actor in this movie, even though the others did a good job too. It's thanks to Bale's performance that I liked this movie and that's the reason why I give this movie a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10."

"latino_kurt","9","0","2","14 July 2005"," American Psycho - the title says it all
","Christian Bale leapt into the public eye with his stunning, dead-eyed performance as Patrick Bateman, the higher-class of serial killer. I agree entirely with one of the review citations on the video case, 'Best movie monster since Hannibal Lecter.' Bateman is darkly humorous at times, but like a true psychopath, he feels only for himself and requires instant and full gratification, and the lengths he goes to in order to achieve this are truly shocking. The yuppy lifestyle of the Eighties is beautifully epitomised by Bale - one of my personal favourite actors - and captured by Mary Harron, who did a brilliant job with the film. Supporting performances by Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis and Jared Leto et al ensure that Bale is not left to carry the burden alone, but when he has to he does it in style. Leo DiCaprio displaced Bale for the part before Bale won it back, and judging by his performance, he was the right man for the job. Ultimately, like the Lecter movies the critics compared it to, this is not simply a tale of gore and frenzy, but a tale of light and dark, woven together inextricably in a single insane mind. Simple tasks that Bateman performs every day remind us that he is still, to a degree, normal, and that there is part of him in all of us, for better or for worse. Brilliant, brutal stuff."
"marknix2000","10","0","2","6 July 2005"," Underrated!
","American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman, a Yuppie who works on Wallstreet to add to the vast wealth he was born with. He has it all, looks, charm, money, popularity and even social standing. However not all is at it seems, as Patrick inexplicably descends further into madness This is by far, an excellent, underrated film that disserves more then simple ""cult"" status. There are of course several attributing factors. Batman star Christian Bale amazingly plays the role of Patrick Bateman. He projects the image of Patrick's cold yet unfulfilling insanity remarkably. It's increasingly interesting throughout the film, to watch the phases in which Bale takes Bateman through. From his over eccentric attitude before his many killings, to his subtle wonder of himself in times where he approaches some form of humanity. The best thing about Bale in this film is each facial expressions is important, a simple thing as a smile can lye a hundred feelings behind it. The best example of Bale's acting in American Psycho is the ""Death By Heuy Lewis"" scene in which he needlessly kills fellow businessman Paul Owen (you may have seen him as ""Angleface"" in ""Fight Club""). In this scene the eccentric behaviour of Bateman is pushed to the extreme, followed by the climax of pure anger; which again is played beautifully by Bale.<br/><br/>But it's not just about Bale, many of he inspiring Dialogue (See below) is taken exactly from ""American Psycho"" the original book by Bret Eastin Ellis. Each line has obviously been painstakingly considered especially since the entire book is written in the first person of Patrick Bateman American Psycho was directed by Mary Harron, whom admitting is not well known in the industry. Many find it interesting to not that Mary is obviously a woman. Considering the fact that the book was almost banned by Feminists when first published. When Mary took the helm, she allowed the story of insanity to be told but with taste.<br/><br/>The only Fault of the film was the choice of Rees Wetherspoon, whom has yet to impress me in any film whatsoever. I personally find her stale and her acting transparent and 2D. Also, Bateman's ""friends"" such as Timothy Bryce were given little screen time; though they may not have been huge characters they were given more flesh in Ellis's classic.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, these faults can be over looked when you can simply admire the glorious acting by Christian Bale and the wonderful Dialogue brought to us by Ellis and Director and Screenwriter Mary Harron. The film is not one for the light hearted, but defiantly one worth watching. An incredibly interesting story of insanity and a look on 1980s culture in America. If you haven't already, see this film! It's a must! 9/10"
"katyggls","9","0","2","5 July 2005"," American Psycho; Great Film With A Lot To Say
","I highly recommend it. The movie is based on the controversial 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis.<br/><br/>The film stars Christian Bale (Little Women, Batman Begins) as Patrick Bateman, a young, handsome, affluent executive in late 1980's New York City. He seems to have it all, cushy job, pretty fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), posh apartment, powerful friends. What he doesn't have is a soul. As he says in the beginning of the film, ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there."" Patrick is a serial killer (or is he? watch the film, what do you think?). The film graphically portrays his nightly homicidal habits, without becoming too slasher flick about it. This film isn't for the faint at heart, besides blood and gore, there are some pretty graphic sexual encounters and nudity. But there is comedy here as well. You'll find yourself laughing at some sequences and feeling terribly guilty about it. The next moment you're wincing at it's raw violence.<br/><br/>If Patrick is the hyper prototype of the 80's yuppie male, then his friends are more realistic reflections of it. In one scene, he and his friends are discussing women. One of his friends asserts that the ideal woman ""consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb f***ing mouth shut"". In another scene, he and his friends are discussing some of the world's problems. When Patrick lists some of the ills that society needs to solve (he doesn't really care, he just wants to be seen as knowledgeable), his friends are amused. The people around him in this yuppie society are obsessed with surfaces. They keep all of their real thoughts, concerns, and emotions buried, and only care about what people wear, drive, own, and buy. For this reason, Patrick, who actually has no inner emotions, is able to move undetected among them.<br/><br/>The film is an exposition of the morally bankrupt 1980's male dominated corporate culture. But this theme is still relevant today. Our culture idealizes the macho, ruthless businessman who treats women as objects and possessions. In a scene of the movie, Patrick tells a woman that he later murders that he's into ""murders and executions"" and she mishears him, thinking he said, ""mergers and acquisitions""; it really comes to the same thing. It is these same men who are now running corporate America. Is it any wonder that corporations seem to feel so little responsibility to their employees, stockholders, the public, the environment, the law, or virtually anything at all? Indeed, Patrick's broad choice of victims in the film (even more in the book) mirror those who are often victimized by corporate America. Women, the poor, the homeless, minorities, the elderly, even animals.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film with superb acting by Christian Bale and a few others, including Chloe Sevigny who plays Jean, Patrick's secretary. The end is perplexing and will cause you to watch the entire movie again to see if you can figure it out."

Murder ensues as a result. This divergence into violence from the neat, wall-street appearance is captivating and oddly humorous and the allusions to the many serial killers and horror films that lead up to that time are very entertaining, and have dual effect of showing the unoriginality of the lead character. Overall, it's a very good film; however the movie dips into absurd towards the end, leaving the viewer to question whether the psychotic events of the film are real or simply imagined by Bateman."

","American Psycho really struck a chord with me when i first saw it at the theater when it came out in 2000. And after seeing it a couple of times more on DVD i can say that the fascination still lives.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call myself a fan of the Brett Easton Ellis book that this movie is based on. While i felt the book did have it's points, i was put off by the overly crude descriptions of violence. While i understood the points Ellis' was trying to make i thought it was excessive and not at all to my tastes. Also the book became somewhat tedious in it's descriptions of pop culture and 1980's phenomena.<br/><br/>The movie however i feel has removed much of what put me off with the book. The brutal violence and gore is toned down (but still present enough to get the point through i think) and the references to 1980's culture are more easily and quickly done in the format of a movie. In this way i felt the satire was more pure and focused in the movie, of course many people are likely to think that the experience is diluted because much of the extreme aspects are gone. I do not, however, share this view.<br/><br/>The first aspect of the movie that strongly appealed to me was Christian Bale. He's just perfect as the well-cut, rich, successful and utterly insane yuppie Patrick Bateman. The casting overall is excellent, but i must say Bale stands out as something of a sensation.<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of discussion on many different message boards about whether the murders in this movie were real, or if they were just a figment of Batemans imagination. My return question is immediately: does it matter? Bret Easton Ellis was on to something when he wrote his book, and that point is further refined here. In a world where every man just cares for himself, and nobody cares about anyone else, it's possible to get away with almost anything. For instance ripping a company apart leaving thousands without a job, or maybe even murder... The idea of the psychopath being allowed to do whatever he pleases without punishment, be it physical or economical harm. To me the concept is what's interesting, not whether he did it or not. The fact that he had fantasies about doing it is enough, the only thing really stopping him was his own inhibitions. Getting away with it was the least of the problems for one who was so inclined.<br/><br/>I think that American Psycho will appeal to many people for many different reasons. Some people will see it as plain comedy, others will recognize it more for what it is. I found it interesting and well worth watching, no matter if you have read the book or not. I rate it 7/10."

Anyway to the film, Bale is absolutely superb in his role and I could not of thought of anybody more suited to it.<br/><br/>A very well put together piece of film as well, showing that because everybody is so into fashion, nobody really has an identity.

The film actually enhances the book, because you find yourself reading in Christian Bales' voice. It sounds strange, I know, but it happens. I really enjoyed reading the book again. The choice of scenes to leave out and those to briefly touch upon was obviously deliberated. I feel that the right decision was made. The film isn't short, but it doesn't drag either. My favourite scene is where he tells Evelyn that he has to return some videotapes. Bale gives someone off-screen the ultimate don't-mess-with-me look, for no apparent reason. It's the small things he does in the performance which truly makes it one of the best of all time! I really hope a special edition is released after the new Batman film launches him to where he belongs. A true masterpiece of an adaptation. Superb!"

","I think the film did OK. Even though on the DVD and VHS covers give a Warning label, I don't think it was THAT graphic. I've seen others that should have had the Warning label. Since Christian Bale is my favorite actor, I can't say bad about him. I like his character and I think he looks SO DARN HANDSOME in business suits. And JUST business suits. I find the movie interesting because this was the first time I saw a movie that was from the ""villian's"" point-of-view and how he sees the environment surrounding him. And I think that was just brilliant and something different. Although, I became I bit rebellious that the fact Patrick Bateman was ignorant and sexually aggressive towards the women he fools around him. What about the prostitutes and the woman tied up on his bed yelling while Patrick is doing sit-ups? And the revolting blood stain on his pillow sheet at the cleaners. But I suppose that was all part of the story. It's a very realistic movie. Who knows? There may be perfect looking men out there with some mental problems out there who go through the same situations like Patrick Bateman. However, my favorite part was when Patrick and his business buddies fumble over business cards. I thought that was just ridiculously hilarious. I guess he doesn't want anyone to get the best of him, but SERIOUSLY, who on EARTH would make such a competition over business cards. Like the clients would notice the ""impressive details"" and the ""watermarks"". Overall, the movie is good. It kept me and my pals at the edge of our seats. But I still can't believe Patrick Bateman ACTUALLY had the guts to confess his murders and yet his lawyer or business partner, whoever he was, didn't believe him the next day."

","I have seen this film a number of times and it just continues to grow on me. It is the most quotable film I have ever seen and Christian Bale's Bateman is probably one of the best acted film villains I have ever seen in cinema. Christian Bale is so totally underrated for the talent he has and displays in every single film he is in, I would say even starting with his role in Empire of the Sun, to American Psycho, to The Machinist, that he has set himself up to be a great character actor. Besides his stellar performance in this film, everyone else I think does an excellent job as well, and the translation from Ellis' novel to the script by Turner and Harron give this film a satirical feminist edge that really subverts '80's pop culture and reganomics. Greed is the creed here, and Bateman is the product of such a heartless society. Perfect film."

In his world of luxurious apartments, fashionable restaurants and expensive clothing nothing matters more than appearance and admiration from others; the ""I"" is in focus and nobody cares about others.<br/><br/>For all those who like the movie I recommend the book (with the same title),...it is probably the best one I ever read.

","I was passed the book from a friend some years ago, and way before any violence occurred I was finding it a hard read. The first few chapters where so full of over descriptive babel I found it hard to believe it had ever been published, there was just too much attention being paid to what seemed like trivial things. I got it in the end, Bateman's whole world thrived on detail and statement, many films may give you ""a slice"" of the eighties but this one gives it in a way that wont make you grimace with embarrassment and say ""jeez do you remember wearing things like that or listening to that"" its more likely to leave you feeling ashamed of a decade where everything became disposable and fake. But all this is just the backdrop to Bateman's world.<br/><br/>Mary Harron did a fantastic job in bringing this to film,I didn't think anyone would go near it. I have had endless arguments with people about whether or not the murders where just all in his mind. Its my opinion that they did occur, but that nobody really cared.Why would they?, as long as they got the south east contract and could get into the most exclusive bars and restaurants. Something that I feel lost its impact from its move to film was, as a male; the uncomfortableness it left me with. There was chapters in the book that where quite obviously meant to arouse you, and they did. This would cut quite sudden to Bateman torturing and killing women. This was a very alarming place to find yourself in. Maybe I feel the film lacked this because I had already experienced this, and maybe because by this stage I realised it was it was a trick employed by Brett Easton Ellis to get you somehow closer to Bateman's state of mind, and get across the idea that the line between his enjoyment of sex and murder had blurred.<br/><br/>This film got a lot of flack from women's groups who claimed that it promoted misogyny and depicted women as victims. All of my female friends that have seen the film or read the book have not seen this at all. They have in fact, compared to myself and male friends that have seen/read it; found it the least disturbing.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was superb. While at the time I only knew him from his childhood film, Empire of the sun. I was a relief to hear he was getting the role as rumours had it that Leonard DiCaprio's was being considered for the role. I am not DiCaprio's bashing, but everything about the role demanded someone who could portray a powerful man and Leonard frankly wasn't built for the job."

","American Psycho is the portrait of a group of individuals within a certain scene in a particular era. The very fact, that those horrible occurrences take place on the top floor of society, and the fact, that this era has passed us by only a short while ago, lets the audience shiver. Here is someone, who enjoys all the material privilege in the world and who is yet all alone and emotionally empty. But is not the fact, that his mind is crammed full with the surface of things, the cause for his indifferent and inhuman behaviour towards his fellow men and (particularly) women? Is not the very fact, that he creates himself a world of norms and values solely from worldly goods (clothes, shape of body, restaurants, food etc.), the cause for his lack of self? The competition for the most impressive business card, suit, restaurant, apartment or whatsoever, which Patrick Bateman usually looses against his fellow workers at Wall Street, forces him to develop substitutive types of satisfaction, which will help him regain power, self-consciousness and inner peace of mind. In his world, those substitutes are sex and murder, both happenings', in which he can (permanently) suppress his opponent' in the one or the other way.<br/><br/>The first disturbing element in this movie, which unleashes the most extreme forms of the American Dream, is the (more or less) willingness of the women to offer themselves as a piece of flesh to the materialistically superior man, who, due to the subordinate behaviour of the respective woman, regains (sexual) power. Another disturbing factor is, that those people, who are aware of Bateman being a serial killer (Bateman's lawyer, the broker), do not report him to the police, and that because of the simple fact, because he belongs to the most 'civilized' class of people (in the eyes of society). What a scandal would that become, if a young man, who has enjoyed the best of homes and education (Harvard) turns out to be a mass murderer? Such things simply do not exist, at least in the preoccupied world of the media. Whereas it is quite common here to read stories about people from the lower classes to commit such horrible crimes (due to a lack of financial security) one rarely reads about an upper-class serial killer. And, as one can read in the first lines of the book, Price tells the reader, why society can not afford to loose his kind: I am creative, I am young, unscrupulous, highly motivated, highly qualified. That is why society can not afford to loose me'. Not even, if I am a serial killer! What must disturb the reader/audience really, is the scene, when Bateman enters Allen's apartment, and he sees nothing but the white and clean walls. The bodies have been eliminated like an error in a pc system, as if they never existed, as if those killings never occurred, as if Paul Allen in fact moved out of the apartment, to have it handed over to a young and innocent couple, so they can enjoy the miraculous view over Central Park now.<br/><br/>A last disturbing element is, that still, after Bateman has admitted all his horrible crimes on the phone and face to face, no one believes him or takes what he says seriously. In this particular social ""league"", it simply does not matter, if he committed those crimes or not. Still it seems of much more significance to keep up appearances of glamour and glory, in order not to let that world of material perfection fall apart. Therefore, Bateman, who is a culprit on the one hand, but who is also a victim of that system on the other, in which worldly goods take possession of mind and soul, is an easy target to sacrifice, so the shiny world of materialism and superficiality will not loose its stability. So, as all his victims, who disappeared like that, he and his psychological trouble are simply being ignored. He simply is not there, as he already states at the very beginning of the film: ""I simply am not there"". No one in that world of superficial riches is actually in a state of being (except of course for the money, that is being in a constant state of (ex)change), which is also why there are no limits left whatsoever."

","""American Psycho"" is a grotesque and satirical fabrication of the deception and tolerance of society and what is designed to unleash our wrath against complying with the social crowd and conformity. This is a gory, yet honest tale of a self-obsessed, arrogant, and repulsive New York yuppie (Christian Bale) in 1980s Wall Street, who wakes up behind a mask, is addicted to cleansing and grooming, listens objectively to Phil Collins music, goes to work, inflicts his verbal rage upon his clientele and friends, arrives back at his penthouse apartment with a lady friend or two, and proceeds to literally mutilate his company, as the cycle goes every day. We can hardly sympathize or even begin to understand this man (Patrick Bateman)'s troubles, frustrations, and compulsive wraths, for he hasn't anything to be infuriated about: he's young, dashing, rich, and can afford any possession or woman of his desire; when his violent rampages manifest, it's anyone's guess as to who or what is perturbing Bateman: perhaps he is manufacturing rages for no apparent reason other than out of sheer boredom and lack of interest. He is one of the most arrogant, superficial, vapid, and utterly detestable figures imaginable, and if we weren't conscious of his fascination with Phil Collins and his adoration with looking petite, we might surmise that Bateman hasn't any sensibilities and is virtually inhuman, making him more of a creature than a man. ""American Psycho"" is perhaps a social commentary on how appearances can be very deceiving: as oblivious characters are enticed into the deranged trap of Bateman, they can only mistake him as being a regular, well-to-do man, without any noticeable deficiencies or dangers, which we realize is quite the contrary to the figure we have come to know and loathe. The film doesn't demand or even any sympathy or understanding for Bateman, but rather, acknowledges his various victims, who are regular dupes in the social landscape of America: they (particularly prostitutes) don't really become acquainted with someone, and yet make themselves perfectly available for a deranged psycho such as Bateman, to have them in their possession and proceed, unsuspected by them, to decapitate their body! This is a chilling, engaging, and ultimately surprising film that sometimes gives overabundant weight to its subject (in the purpose of having us despise his repulsive tendencies), and not enough insight as to the reasons behind his psychopathic behavior. Yet perhaps this is excusable, because some psychopathic figures are not worth examining for their inconceivable features, as they haven't any conscience to examine! Christian Bale is fantastically loathsome as Patrick Bateman, in a film that defies to manufacture excuses or insights for its subject's insanity, but rather, suggests that his actions are all concoctions of his own bewildering, despicable, nature.

This is a movie everyone should enjoy as it is a pleasure for the eyes and the ears!!2 hours never went by that fast..."

","Brent Elliss' book is superior to the movie and the story can be appreciated a little more.He uses a lot of description,and the graphic nature is far more gruesome in the book.I would like to know however why it is Paul Allen in the movie but Paul Owen in the book? If they would have copied the book to the letter there would be no chance of it ever coming out.This I presume is why they added the chainsaw scene which I thought took away fom the movie,but you can't show what really happen to those pros or the audience would make a mess in the theatre.

I gave this film an excellent rating for its depiction of hilariously superficial Harvard-educated Wall Street types. This is not the usual depiction of the smug rich as comical boobs, but as deeply twisted and fundamentally empty people. In my experience, the latter depiction is closer to the truth.<br/><br/>The main character's complete self-obsession is illustrated through his egotistical practices. These range from his endless physical workouts and ""metro-sexual"" attention to his looks, to his ravenous desire for sex and violence. The on-screen sex could offend more sensitive American viewers, and th on-screen violence will offend most European viewers.

","Now this is a good horror slasher flick. It is much more than that as well. Not only does AP bring some class and wit to this genre, but it also brings an eerily realistic and masterful acting performance from Christian Bale. Absolutely perfect. Thinking that Leo was being considered for this makes me nauseous. There's no way he could've pulled it off anywhere even close to the magnitude that Bale did. On top of his acting, he looks perfect for this role...a normal good-looking guy on the outside, but with something very dark and sick just under the surface. You can see it in his eyes. For this film alone, I eagerly await to see him in more films. <br/><br/>Now I will say that I have not read the book, so anything I bring up or comment on is strictly for the film itself, as a film. It's usually a fairly pointless routine to compare books and movies anyway.<br/><br/>Set in the snooty materialism days of the 80's in New York, all of the film's characters only care about two things, money and themselves. This is a recurring theme that pops up continuously throughout the film, most importantly attributing to the fact that Bale doesn't seem able to be caught because people are too wrapped up in these two things. In that sense, the film is a mockery of sorts, a satire of the time period and culture. Bateman (Bale) cares about money, but has become bored with the way his life has become, and really simply cares about his outward image and his desires that he cannot completely control. <br/><br/>Through witty narration and random speeches Bateman gives, we realize the extent of his obsessions and how they completely run every aspect of his life. The best example of this is given in one of the first scenes where he's talking about how he prepares himself for the day. Great stuff. This film also has quite a bit of comedy contained in it as well, at least if you have the right sense of humor. There are several classically funny parts throughout, mostly attributed to the subtle yet clever narration. <br/><br/>Not only that, if you leave out the book when interpreting this film, it leaves itself quite open and is a cause for much debate here on IMDb. It's one that can constantly be debated as long as the book worms can't leave out the fact that it's based on a book. I stand somewhere in the middle but on neither side. After all, films should, in all rights, stand by themselves. Visit the AP message boards after viewing for more of what I speak.<br/><br/>Overall, an immensely funny look at materialism and murder, and the perceptions contained in our world and or lack thereof. All but perfect. Not for everyone though (especially children), and it's probably a little misunderstood, hence it's curiously low rating. If you enjoyed Fight Club, you'll probably find some intriguing elements here.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

Patrick Bateman gets rather bored of it all and embarks on nights of murder and ultra violence in order to brighten up his dull little life. I found this film very entertaining and was surprised and full of joy by discovering the shocking truth at the end. If you like films like that (Fight Club, Vanilla Sky or Phonebooth) then I would really recommend this film to you.

"scogden","Null","0","1","5 May 2004"," 'There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,.. But there is no real me'
","American Psycho is a dark comedy taken from the popular book written by Brett Easton Ellis and it focuses on the life of mass murdering 'yuppie' called Patrick Bateman who works for one of the top banks in New York owned by his father. This cleverly constructed film is focused around the central theme of conflict between having some individuality but also fitting into a society where looks are everything.  Appearance is all important; the right suit and shoes make or break an individual; the right grooming products are vital and where you live is key to being liked. To ensure acceptance Bateman's social group all dress alike. Thus the clothes that they all wear become uniform. It prevents expressions of individuality and this denies Bateman an identity of his own and is frequently mistaken for other businessmen. There are many factors in this film that attracted me such as the way we constantly hear Patrick Bateman's thoughts through voiceovers and this feels like he is addressing us and draws us closer to him on a personal level. Even though we witness killings and sick acts, we leave feeling sorry for him and not for his victims. Instead the film makes us blame society. The music in this film is used very well as it makes us laugh in scenes of extreme violence. When one murder occurs we hear an upbeat song playing on his stereo and this lightens the mood completely and makes the scene very surreal. There are certain aspects of this film that let down the glowing performance of Christian Bale as 'Patrick Bateman', such as the supporting actors and actresses who are at turns humorous, tragic and touching in their roles but luckily this does not let down the flow of the movie in a noticeable way. There is one aspect of this film that can confuse the viewer and that is the ending which leaves the audience asking themselves many questions. This can be seen as a positive effect also. The characters in this film are all likeable, especially Bateman who we connect with the most. All of the supporting actors roles combine in a way that makes Bateman appear even more twisted and his role more surreal. Rees Witherspoon plays a very convincing role alongside Bateman as his girlfriend who seems only interested in money and a rich lifestyle. Overall this film is just as stylish, slick and successful as Bateman himself and although a lot of Ellis's book is not in the script, this black satire movie successfully portrays a society where no one has their own identity and where Patrick Bateman shows us the his inner thoughts.<br/><br/>
'Bateman is a paragon of conformity in an amoral society where to conform is to be amoral.'<br/><br/>An excellent film that should be seen.<br/><br/>5 stars"
"Chainsaw Slasher","Null","0","1","9 May 2004"," Brilliant, Amazing
","I absolutely love this film.  The first time I saw this film, I enjoyed it. The second time I saw it is when I bought it, I then loved it.  The third time was a charm and I began to delve deep into the film and the personality of Patrick Bateman.  It then drove me to read the book.  And let me tell you, if you think this film is twisted, try reading the book, it will blow your mind.  Not only on a violent level, but on a perverse one as well. <br/><br/>
After reading the book, I just became amazed at how Harron handled making this film.  She captured the feel perfectly, as well as Bateman's personality. It's said that DiCaprio was a choice to play Bateman, man am I glad he did not! The film wouldn't have the right affect.  Christian Bale has that everday looking face of gentleman, while DiCaprio doesn't. <br/><br/>
I just have to say I'm religous about this film, even more so about the book.  So glad they made a film for this book.  Rarely do we have films that are from the perception of the killer.  We have films like ""Maniac,"" or ""Dahmer""  that truely deliver the inner most thoughts of madness, and now we have ""American Psycho.""  What makes this film special is that there's nothing there. No reason for the madness, no vengeance, just born from hell madness created by the materialistic U.S.A.  <br/><br/>Watch this film."

"citizenchris","7","0","1","18 April 2004"," American Psycho and movies based on novels.
","I'm a movie guy, what can I say. I wish I were `well read', I'm just not a book guy. That's not to say I'm an illiterate boob. I enjoy a good novel every now and then. But usually I rely on the printed page for books of the non-fiction variety.  I'm almost always irritated when I hear some snob complaining how the movie they just saw wasn't as good as the book. You know what I'm talking about. At one point in you life you have been on one side of one of those kinds of conversations. I'm usually on the side that says.'well I don't know about the book but the movie was swell' or `well I don't know about the book but the movie sucked' Either way I feel that a movie should be judged on its own merits. The two art forms, novels and films, are completely different.  At least I that's how I felt before I read Bret Easton Ellis's novel `American Psycho'. I picked it up because I was in love with the film. I sorta went into the whole experience of reading the novel expecting it to be a sort of `un-cut' version of the film. This intrigued me a great deal. Needless to say upon reading this great novel I came away less a fan of the film and more a fan of the printed work. The novel sort of ruined the film for me. And I in subsequent conversations with my pals I ended up on the other side of that afore mentioned book to film comparison conversation. I remember viewing my DVD of American Psycho right after I completed the novel and being completely disappointed. It now seemed that so much of Patrick's character arc was just ignored. His relationship with Jean his secretary was entirely ignored.  Characters names were seemingly arbitrarily changed. There wasn't enough narration, after the entire book was told almost completely from Patrick's narration. And that one scene in the film where Jean reads his journal and finds the macabre sketches seemed a complete betrayal of the story's first person nature. My problem at the time was that I was making all the comparisons that I think shouldn't be made when a film is adapted from a novel. The theatrical film medium is extremely limited in the narrative it is capable in bringing forth to the audience. Traditionally you get 2 to 3 hours and you have to rely on what is primarily a visual medium to adapt a written one. That is one thing most filmmakers and audiences forget. Filmmakers rarely utilize the picture tells a thousands words school of filmmaking and stoop to cheesy music and bad dialogue to get the point across. This is true for most films nowadays let alone those based on novels. And audiences foolishly expect a scene-by-scene adaptation of their favorite literary work. Once I re-examined my criticism I viewed the film sever times over. I came to the conclusion that it is indeed a good adaptation. It is brilliant how they incorporated the music review chapters. I also realized its not that the violence in the film is a watered down version from the book. It's more that those ultra-violent scenes are simply not in the film. When you think about its amazing how much of the book Marry Haron and Guinevere Turner managed to fit into their script. The answering scene confession stands out as one of the best scenes in recent memory. Bale deserved some recognition for this scene alone.<br/><br/>So what we are left with is a good film with a verry Kubrick like feel. A film with amazing performances and witty dialogue, much of which was lifted strait from the novel. Though many of my complaints still stand, they don't ruin what is otherwise a worthwhile movie experience. One could do much worse when choosing a Friday night rental."

","I saw American Psycho 4 times at the theaters. Few movies make it in to my 4 timers. There are some people out there that go and see movies 10 times or a hundred times, but that's a waste of money, just buy it when it's released for home systems! This movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich, good looking, yuppie with a secure job, and a perfect life. Unfortunately Patrick is completely mad. This film based on the book American Psycho was a breath of fresh air when it was released. There were a lot of movies coming out that just seemed like products, and really had no substance. Although a lot of people didn't understand the movie, and expected something much different. What you need to understand is this movie is a dark comedy, and the things in the movie are not to be taken seriously. I even got scolded for laughing at parts while in the theater. The only thing that could ruin a great movie like this is if you made a sequel...oh, they did that. One of the great things about this movie is you can talk to people about what you think happened, whether he dreams everything, or it really happened. American Psycho 2, which is not written by the Author who wrote American Psycho the book, pretty much just shoved their opinion of what happened. So if you are going to see part 1, there is no need to see part 2. I can watch this movie over and over and never get sick of it."
"Ben_Cheshire","8","0","1","19 April 2004"," One of the darkest, most cynical movies ever made - but maybe not for the reasons you think.
","I think this movie deserves to be controversial, but not for the reasons it has. I don't believe it is in any way irresponsible filmmaking - never did i feel the filmmakers were endorsing the behaviour of Patrick Bateman and the society he was a part of (1987 New York Yuppie) - if anything, they too strongly hint to the audience that they are satirising this materialistic world through turning character into charicature. In fact, this movie gives new viciousness to the word ""satire.""<br/><br/>It is a fascinating movie - absolutely compelling, in fact. Its cartoon-like characters are marvellous to watch, and often it is very funny, though we are constantly reminded that the jokes are at the expense of these obnoxious characters, who in turn are sending up an entire way of life now referred to as ""the excesses of the 80's."" But through this very specific period-grounding of the film (1987, constantly reinforced through the soundtrack and the fashion victims...badum, ching!) the movie creates a very dark picture of human nature in general, and warns against letting society become like this again, where material worth and surface value are all that matter.<br/><br/>At one point Bateman's girlfriend says to him, ""We have to talk."" He replies: ""You look gorgeous, there's nothing to talk about."" This precice bit of dialogue encapsulates the lack of real human interaction in this society. No two characters properly have a conversation in this movie - everyone is constantly performing a monologue at someone else, to satisfy their own whims.<br/><br/>The director described the movie as having dual stories: Bateman's group of ""friends"" and business associates provide social satire of this vacuous society, and the other story follows the misadventures of Patrick Bateman, Serial Killer by Night. This part of the movie is really no different to any other crime movie, where we follow the criminal. Certainly not as controversial as i had heard, because the filmmakers are constantly trying to make a point.<br/><br/>(spoilers... what i think that point is...)<br/><br/>These two stories are not totally independent, they very much serve each other. The central point of Bateman's being a serial killer is a very dark demonstration of what one does if one loses all contact with other human beings. If you only care about surfaces, and not about anything deeper, then there's no reason not to go out and slaughter people, if this satisfies you. In this way, Bateman is enabled by the society around him (which encourages the worship of surfaces). This is perfectly presented in the final scene of the movie, which may seem not very climactic action-wise, because it is mainly a climax of the unification of these two story lines. No-one will listen to Bateman when he tries to confess his crimes. No-one will hear him, because everyone only cares about themselves and surfaces. The irony of Bateman's uncontrollably going out and killing people at whim is that this then becomes a secret for him, something deep and real, that, perhaps for the first time, he feels emotion over. It is something that goes beyond the usual ""where should we make a reservation"" or ""check out my new business card"" chit-chat that is the level this people live on. So when he tries to tell his lawyer this, the lawyer suddenly pretends not to know him.<br/><br/>(spoilers still!)<br/><br/>Identity is a big thing for Patrick Bateman, which explores the issue: if the physical/material is all that matters in this society, what is a human being? At the beginning Bateman tells us he has all the physical attributes of a human being, but on the inside, there's nothing, just an empty shell. This is why Bateman's mentioning ""the inside"" again in the final scene is significant. Ghostly visual references to Bateman only being an empty shell abound: Bateman's face is constantly shown hidden, distorted through translucent glass.<br/><br/>(end spoilers)<br/><br/>I think its a movie to see. I saw it again, and liked it a whole heap more the second time. The more you see it, the more of its satire you pick up (not that its subtle, but you laugh at it more)."

The movie also built the tension all the way up to the end and then leaves you with a twist but the kind of twist you leave thinking about until you agree you have to watch again."

","So, after watching it for myself I have come to my own conclusion, which is that this movie was brilliantly written. It's almost as though the writer is mocking the corporate world with the character Pat Bateman. Some of the lines for this character were quite obviously a stab at corporate conformity, (eg. ""Because I want to fit in!"") but my boyfriend didn't seem to grasp the concept as well as I had and was left felling as though the writing was sloppy, and the movie just all around confusing. Maybe it was. But Christian Bales performance really brings the script to life. Non-stop laughs all the way through, that is if you pick up the sick humor right from the beginning. There's also some very hard hitting scenes with a character called ""Christie"", which manage to show us just how inhuman Bateman really is by how she acts and behaves around him and later on, his friend. Lovely movie, but please watch it with an open mind and *Look* for those cocky hidden messages in between what ""seems"" to be meaningless sex scenes."

","Again not having read the book, I can't say how good of an adaptation this is, but as a film, it's exceptional. Add to that, this is the role Christian Bale was born to play. I just can't see anyone else doing it. A special thumbs-up must also go to Mary Harron for giving the whole thing a very enjoyable off-beat feel. The performances are overplayed, but on purpose and it works like a charm. It would be totally wrong to call American Psycho just a horror movie. The film is a delicious satire of yuppies and I can't remember laughing so hard recently. Loses touch a bit in the last reel, though, but not enough to make it standard fare. Simply brilliant! And by the way, that's **** for my Rules of Attraction comment. I urge you to give Patrick Bateman a chance.. or are you afraid you might like it? ""Is that Ivana Trump?!""<br/><br/>**** / *****"
"kumayl_patel-1","10","0","1","31 December 2003"," A movie about wall street and a psycho being the backdrop!
","By Kumayl Before starting out I would like to give you readers a brief introduction. American psycho was a very extreme and violent novel that was also infact due to its content the most 'controversial' piece of literature ever produced. But what the director has done, she has basically 'toned' down the graphic nature of the book and converted it into a materialistic and worldly psychopath killer: The 80's Wall Street greed.<br/><br/>On a personal note, American Psycho is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen! It is truly my favorite film of all time.<br/><br/>Now, I know the name Psycho presents material violent in nature but director Mary Harron has portrayed this movie from the innermost feelings exposed directly from the main character being Patrick Bateman outstandingly played by actor Christian Bale.          (Who currently is working on a new `Batman' movie scheduled for release in the summer of 2005).<br/><br/>
Patrick Bateman is a complete definition of a perfect young upcoming urban professional, a.ka. `Yuppie'. He has all the characteristics of a human being but not a single clear identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust. All his friends and coworkers talk about is money and Donald Trump and although Patrick tries to embrace these money-oriented issues he simultaneously transforms himself into a sick repulsive madman.<br/><br/>
American Psycho teaches us that there can be a Patrick Bateman everywhere. He could be our neighbor, our colleague, a person we brush into while we walk into a supermarket or even a person at Kashmir Road! The fact that we cannot recognize a psychopath is that they easily blend into our society making us think that they are normal. I mean in the final chapters of the book author Bret Easton Ellis shows Patrick Bateman losing his sanity so badly that he resorts to drinking his own urine, sleeping under his futon and eating handfuls of sand on the beach while his fiancé manicures her nails.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this movie to people faint of heart or children. This movie is not about killing in any way. Its about how our society itself with all its glamour and greed can make a man transform into a complete sadist slaughterer. It's a movie which will be enjoyed by young people living in the Manhattan atmosphere at where this movie and book's plot is located."

","A good friend of mine don't wanna see the movie just because he thinks the film can only be a letdown because of the brilliance of the book, I myself never read the book so I can watch it without prejudices that a good book never can match the equality on celluloid. The story is known...a great businessman Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) lives a double life : at office he's the arrogant businessman who cares about the design of his visitcards but outside he is a serial killer (prostitutes are his fave targets) and his life that is dominated by designers and extreme care for the way you look like, but he also is addicted to pornmovies and yuppiemusic (before he starts killing someone, he first reviews a cd...all yuppiemusic like Whitney Houston, Genesis and Huey Lewis And The News). We all know our Patrick Batemans in our world (perhaps your manager huh?) and Christian Bale plays his role in a perfect way, you just hate him from the early start and you just hope he'll be caught as soon as possible, perhaps it's jealousy. The film itself is filmed like the decors Bateman lives in, all pretty cold and no real depth (the kind of yuppies who pretend to be it while their life is just one bulb), never that violent (except the images afterwards) and tons of sex...and for oldies like us, great songs from the eighties!

","I've seen American Psycho perhaps 10 times; and it still rules.<br/><br/>It's funny, it's cool, and it's got a point to it. I saw it the movies with a couple of mates, and afterwards one goes to me 'so did he really kill all those people or not'? I replied 'it doesn't matter', with a sufficiently cold stare. They thought that was the most psycho line of the night. I was pleased.<br/><br/>I tried reading the book but stopped when I realised the guy writing it was essentially, a pretty sick guy. Really, why isn't that guy locked away? Lock him up. The violence in the book is thought to be there to enhance the message of the book, and to provoke some kind of distancing from the story itself. The point was made early on. It continues, maybe for noteriety, maybe because the guy is really that messed up. It's uneccessary.<br/><br/>The movie stays away from this. It tells the story the way it could be told, and is probably even more effective than the book. The monologues are fantastic and Christian Bale is excellent. I heard that Leonardo DiCaprio could have been Bateman for this, which would have been the next biggest shame; apart from of course the rest movies he has been cast in.<br/><br/>William Dafoe and Bale have great interaction together and I look forward to their scenes when I watch the movie again.<br/><br/>The music is great and whenever I get the chance I like to discourse about art/pop bands from the 80's to whoever will listen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, don't waste your time with the book, you'll just be appalled and needlessly so.<br/><br/>Check out this movie.

","I was uncertain about this film.  I knew of the book, but had never read it. The controversy intrigued me, so I rented the movie.  Since I haven't read the book, I cannot comment on how it compares with the film.  The script has some great satirical moments and the direction is cautious - perhaps too much so.  I actually found myself amazed that there was such a controversy over this film.  Many main stream movies are far more violent and sexually graphic than American Psycho.  While I didn't find the film as offensive as I thought I would, I wasn't incredibly impressed with the story and in fact there is only one element that elevates the film as a whole from okay to great:Christian Bale's performance.  He is so superb that one cannot help but be captivated by him from beginning to end.  It is a technically flawless performance and he deserves far more recognition than he received for his portrayal.  In fact, this film is a rare example of a single performance being so impressive that it turns an otherwise passable movie into a must-see.   So, next time you make the decision to watch a violent movie, skip the popcorn slasher flics with their drippy teen sensation stars and instead watch Christian Bale's mesmerizing performance in American Psycho."

To me, this movie is a satire of corporate/upper middle class life, and actually gets to be pretty funny at times when you think about what's really going on (not to give away the end, which actually works for a change).  Watching the main character struggle with trying to fit in, trying to be noticed, and trying to maintain an image of what he thinks his co-workers want him to be, and then having this glaringly contrasted with his inner rage at having to do all this and having it not work so well...there's a great scene when christian bale's character is just seething inside because someone upstaged his new business card...it's perfect. and so funny! unfortunately the satire and necessary humor are downplayed too much at times, and the movie loses its footing, getting a bit too serious and letting the satire (which is its main pull for me) slip away almost entirely at times - like the director couldn't decide what he wanted the film to convey.

","The first time I watched this movie, I expected to see some stupid slasher flick, with a crazed anonymous killer killing people for no good reason, the goal of the film merely to scare people.<br/><br/>Well, American Psycho is basically the opposite of that.  The whole idea here is to open up the killer to you, to show you his mind, why he kills, what his world is like.  This is really a much more interesting subject than the fear of random attack victims.  <br/><br/>Inside Patrick Bateman's mind (masterfully played by Christian Bale), we are introduced to a mind where nothing has value, where even the idea of value is absent.  All that is left is fashion, having a great body, eating at the most popular restaurants, having a good job with the best business cards. Particularly poignant is the way he relates to music.  He has heard what music is popular and has clearly read reviews of it but he can do no better than mechanically quote these, since he doesn't know what is valuable about it.<br/><br/>What's more, Bateman can never succeed in any of this, but instead finds an urge to destroy, both out of jealousy, and as some kind of misplaced sexual urge.  Part of this is inscrutable, of course, as (for most people) it is impossible to truly relate to someone like this character...<br/><br/>There is a great deal here to be consumed by a voracious viewer.  Don't just watch this movie once, watch it repeatedly and you will begin to understand better and better.  Even if this isn't your aim, Bateman's unique brand of creepiness is radiant and infective.  <br/><br/>And this will scare you way more than any slasher movie... though it may not make you jump quite as much."

","What keeps us from doing evil?  A capacity for empathy, hopefully, plus our subconscious belief (ingrained by, among other things, our habitual shortage of money) that you simply can't do anything you want.  As neither of these attitudes characterise the yuppie, the idea that such a person could become a psychopathic killer is quite a good one.  Nonetheless, ""American Psycho"", based on exactly this premise, is not really a successful film. <br/><br/>
There are two linked reasons for this.  Firstly, the idea that the yuppie is as inhuman as the murderer is introduced at the outset, a position so extreme there is no onward journey that can be made.  Secondly, the killer's actions are a response to his life in general, rather than to particular stimuli, hence there's no plot in the conventional sense.  Christian Bale does a good job playing a man with no soul, but there's nothing new to learn once the concept is grasped.  The emphasis on the 1980s settings also serves to dull the film's satirical intent, de-stressing its own relevance to us, today.<br/><br/>Brett Easton Ellis can certainly write, but this is not a great adaptation of his famous book.  For a really disturbing and suspenseful look at the world of American business, try Neil La Bute's ""In the company of men""."

As Bateman, his wooing technique that Serial Killers undergo to lessen the victim's defences-is scary, his persuasive gibberish to make his victim's unaware of his deliberate actions onto them can give you the shakes.<br/><br/>Reese Withespoon is wonderful and a great-looking actress to play Bateman's fiancée who is not treated well, and Matheson as the Mistress that does not get treated any better - they get cabs to go out with Bateman, but he later rides in a Limo to attract Victims!!<br/><br/>Chole Sevigny kicks ass as a naive Secretary, who later is pardoned by Patrick Bateman.<br/><br/>There are scenes that are wrong about Serial Killers, for example Patrick is running around with a Chainsaw in a public condo-which is too noisy for any Serial Killer to use because they must be stealthy to kill a victim, and avoid getting caught. That also includes being butt naked!<br/><br/>But on the whole, it is a movie to show people what is it like to be a Serial Killer-and it can be a B****, when a lot of fantasies of violence run though your mind at any given time and you gotta allure people into your trap to ease your urge to torture and murder, oh and don't forget a souvenir and dispose the body, visit the scene of crime to get more satisfaction of your urges ...Oh boy! it is not easy huh!?!<br/><br/>(Spoiler starts here) This movie is not half-bad, better than some movies I have seen, especially American Psycho 2-what a waste of negatives!!<br/><br/>You can tell number 2 is crap when somebody who is not 'Christian Bale' is now playing Bateman, and how can a weak little girl kill off a Serial Killer that has a good physique? what I dread is that girl said<br/><br/>""I want to track down other Serial Killers - I can't wait to grow up"" Agggggggggghhhhhh! why did I rent this darn film??<br/><br/>Then Yasmin Bleeth look-a-like Mila Kunis from the 70's Show turns up, OK!! she is attractive, but her acting and her vocal narration -Sheeeeeesh let's not go there! and how did she ever get to be a surviving Victim? Chloe Sevigny was the only survivor-it does not make sense. I beg of you, save yourselves and don't watch American Psycho 2, because American Psycho 1 is far better."
"Lily_Light","Null","0","1","23 February 2003"," A thought-provoking study of the inner workings of a dark and twisted mind.
","Tonight I finally caught American Psycho. First I must say I found the title somewhat misleading as I fully expected it to be another slasher flick, but it's actually a psychological thriller with a dash of satire.<br/><br/>
Christian Bale, as Patrick Bateman, gives a striking performance as a young, wealthy Wall Street yuppie, representing corporate America in the 1980's, where he and his peers are obsessed with getting into the trendiest restaurants and which of them possess the finest business cards. They all have the same haircut and wear the same business suits, rendering them nearly interchangeable and making for frequent cases of mistaken identity.<br/><br/>
Bateman, whose idea of foreplay is pontificating on the merits of his favorite 1980's songs, is disgusted with his fellow man's lust for material status and conformity. Lacking emotion, he acts on impulse and murders co-workers and clueless prostitutes while maintaining the facade of shallow, materialistic conformity. Unfortunately, the shallow lifestyle is the very thing that leaves him feeling empty inside and provokes the killings.<br/><br/>
The conclusion of the film leaves it to the audience to determine whether Bateman actually murdered anyone or if he merely fantasized the killings. Perhaps it was yet another case of mistaken identity, one which allowed Bateman to get away with murder. Of course American Psycho II (which I saw before part one) answers the question of whether or not he was a murderer.<br/><br/>
Directed by a woman, American Psycho is a thought-provoking study of the inner workings of a dark and twisted mind."

","Having read the book, and thoroughly enjoyed it, I have come up with an order in which to partake of them:<br/><br/>1.Watch the film. 2.Read the book 3. Watch the film.<br/><br/>In short, watch the movie to help you visualise the book, read the book to help you understand the movie, then sit back and question your own sanity as you actually laugh at the poignant Eighties Satire throughout. It makes Reese Witherspoons acting seem a lot less wooden for one, but the one thing that reading the book did for my appreciation of the film was to let me know things the film just didnt have the time or space to do-like the history of Patricks family, most notably the fact that he has a brother, who is so similar to Paul Allen (or Owen as the book would have us believe) in many respects, that Batemans reasons for not killing his own brother are as shallow and meaningless as himself-suitably hilarious too, but I wont spoil it for you.<br/><br/>But is it any good? Oh yes. It is very, very good. If not for being the first movie to incorporate Robert Palmer into its soundtrack, then for its sheer visual impressiveness, the crisp feel of the restaurant linen portrayed ON SCREEN! It looks fabulous, and the plot is, albeit shortened from the book, a very immersive one, with an ending as killer as the main protagonist.<br/><br/>A resounding 9/10 from me."

","Okay so it wasn't a patch on the book. As a movie and book buff I can safely say the only film I have ever seen which DID surpass the book was 'The Shawshank Redemption' and I don't think many would disagree. So I wasn't expecting this film to wow me as the book did - the book is a classic in every way and I've read it over ten times, one of my all time faves. The film simply cannot convey the depths of emptiness that Bateman has sunk to, though it still provides for a highly entertaining, funny and brilliantly acted piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Bale is perfect, Dafoe a pleasure (as always) and even Leto charmingly stupid. Witherspoon I can't stand and although this film did nothing to change that, I grudgingly admit she was perfect as Evelyn, though one has to wonder whether she was in on the joke.<br/><br/>As a black comedy, it's confusing - as a horror movie, it's too arty - as a psychological thriller, it's lost control - but as a movie, it's damn good. Just don't try to categorise it, and don't try too hard to analyse it. If that's what you're after, read the book (twice). Portraying modern society's undeniable emptiness and ultimate futility in two hours was never going to be easy, but if that's your cup of tea (it's certainly mine) then this is a great ride. For my money this is far better conveyed in the masterpiece 'Fight Club' but 'Psycho' is worth your time."

"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","2","10 September 2002"," A dark look at the subconscious mind of the typical American male.
","American Psycho seems to be concerned with what it is that Americans really think about, and puts forth a rather disturbing assertion. This movie reminds me of an old video I saw of Jim Carrey back when he was a stand-up comedian. I think this was even before his Saturday Night Live days. He was talking about how we all have these weird, violent urges many times a day, but luckily we all have that voice of reason in our heads that tells us not to act on these urges (`Ah-ah-ah, turning the car into oncoming traffic  is counterproductive!!'). Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman is a guy who has those normal urges, just like any normal American, but lacks the voice of reason. He acts on his urges, and basically becomes what any of us would become if we did the same thing. <br/><br/>Sure, I'm kind of going out on a limb to say that any normal American would turn into the murderous monster that Patrick Bateman is, but there is definitely an element of truth to that. If everyone acted on their urges, the world would be a nightmarish place. <br/><br/>The movie starts out by introducing Bateman as a typical young businessman in the tradition of the guys in Boiler Room. Completely obsessed with money, superficiality, a dizzying array of skin creams and ointments, reservations at the trendiest restaurants in town, the goofy names for the colors of his business cards, etc. You know, things that normal people don't care about. But of course, Patrick Bateman is not a normal guy. These are all things that reflect the heavy undercurrent of sexual symbolism. This film is packed with references to the insecurity of the typical male about his sexuality, and Bateman acts all of these things out in every way from the kind of business card that he has to the kinds of people that he kills and how he kills them. Not a pretty idea, but the film definitely has something to say. This is not just some frivolous exercise in sex and violence and murder and rape, the movie has a message to deliver and it knows how to get some attention.<br/><br/>American Beauty had a million things to say, not the least of which had to do with modern American society's obsession with superficiality and skin-deep beauty. American Psycho has some similar things to say, most of them much darker than anything in American Beauty (which had some pretty dark stuff in it!), but not delivered in quite the same stunningly skilled and complex package. American Psycho is a masculine film about American males and directed by a woman, which is just as well because a male director may have been a little insecure about portraying a deeper level of male consciousness in such a brutally accurate manner."

","""American Psycho"" is purportedly a satire of the 1980s Wall Street culture of greed, but sadly, I don't understand what is being satirized. The characters seem cartoonish, and impossibly venal and corrupted. Is this really the culture of America's big investment banks and its running dogs? After this year's corporate scandals, maybe ""American Psycho"" would be an improvement.<br/><br/>Politics and sociology aside, ""American Psycho"" is an uneven film. The acting is superb and Christian Bale's portrayal of the sociopathic young banker, Patrick Bateman, drips cold menace even while ordering dinner. The first two-thirds of the movie are very effective, walking a narrow line between horror and satire. But during the final third, the film changes direction, loses focus, and doesn't finish well. <br/><br/>I'm conflicted whether to recommend this movie. The film is graphically violent and misogynistic (and as a consequence, disturbing). If you can handle rough films, you might give it a try. But in my opinion, ""American Psycho"" is a near miss."

","With all the controversy surrounding this story, it was no surprise that it would eventually be made into a film.  It's also no surprise that the extreme graphic violence in the story would be missing from any contemporary attempt at releasing it as a movie.  In any event, the picture does capture a lot of the satire of Ellis' story and Christian Bale goes all out to capture the emotionless persona of the self-obsessed killer.  I think the essence of the picture, though, is compromised without the outrageous, sadistic violence of the book.  AMERICAN PSYCHO is not just a mean-spirited study of self-absorption and emotional dysfunction, it's also a view of an alternate moral satisfaction, one based on murder and mayhem and one that was much more successfully presented in film's like Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS or Pasolini's SALO.

","The poster for American Psycho is incredible. <br/><br/>The film, on the other hand, is so pointless it's almost difficult to sum up.<br/><br/>There are certainly many people who will enjoy this movie, assuming there are a large number of serial killers in the world. Because, frankly, unless you find brutal murder funny, there's not much redeeming about this movie.<br/><br/>From the opening, we meet Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). He's well-dressed, has perfect hair, and a penchant for brutally murdering people. This brings us to our first flaw. Director Mary Harron would like you to believe that he's a nice normal guy and then really shock you with that first murder scene. In fact, I was hoping for someone to get killed just so we could get on with her pithy little movie.<br/><br/>Every character in this movie is simply uninteresting. Reese Witherspoon appears at Patrick's girlfriend, and phones in her performance. Chloe Sevigny is superfluous as Patrick's secretary, and Jared Leto is simply in the movie because he sort of looks like Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Bale, on the other hand, does a good job of making me hate his character. Then again, he doesn't do it correctly. I hate this guy not because he kills people, but because he isn't believable. He reeks of phoniness 24/7, and the entire film, we watch as Bale tries to hide his grin, as if he's saying ""mommy, I'm naughty"".<br/><br/>So, while the audience sits there, Bale kills lots of people, and apparently it's funny. The audience who previewed this with me was roaring, as if this was some masterwork of Groucho Marx (who probably could have done a better chainsaw gag if given the chance).<br/><br/>Perhaps the most awful thing about this movie is that it tries to be so witty, when in fact, it's just stupid. Before he kills his victims, Patrick talks about 80s music, that is simply stuck on the soundtrack to make us think it's the 80s, as if it mattered. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful date movie, if you're dating Ted Bundy, or if your idea of a fun evening is Robert Palmer and Huey Lewis intermixed with brutal murder.<br/><br/>I give this movie 1 star out of 5.

And although you may hate yourself for it, you'll find yourself laughing hysterically at the most violent parts--really!<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for a mature audience. It's very obviously not reality, but it may seem like it at times. There is nudity in great quantities, and it is about a serial killer, so there's violence. The 80's satire is bitter and so true, sometimes it hurts.<br/><br/>Back to Christian Bale...he was amazing. Although he wasn't attractive for one millisecond of this movie, and I have to give him credit for that, you can't keep your eyes off the guy. He's just so gosh darn interesting. You keep wondering what's going on in Bateman's mind, and then about a third of the way through, you realize that there's nothing going on in his mind, and that's what's so cool about the whole movie!<br/><br/>I have to warn you that there are some people that came away from the movie a little shaken up. They didn't understand it, or they thought it was going to be something it wasn't. American Psycho is a really messed up movie, but it's supposed to be that way, and it's done terrifically!<br/><br/>And for anyone who's worried that this is a scary movie, the only thing scary about it is that someone was tweaked enough to write it!

His complaints about the homeless, the silencer that he had, the rat with the cheese.  Terrible, Terrible adaptation of the book.

"thescab","Null","0","1","16 April 2000"," Solid adaptation of certain themes in the novel...
","I read the book several years ago and originally thought it would be close to impossible to turn this into a coherent, linear motion picture.  The story didn't strike me as the kind that could adapt itself to have a beginning, middle, and ending.  At least in so far as it could be told in 90-120mins.<br/><br/>I had read several reviews of the film and found myself interested to say the least.  I understood the violent aspects of the book were largely omitted, and the movie tried to focus on more of a satirical depiction of life on Wall St. in the mid-80's.<br/><br/>It was here that I had trouble thinking about how they could really translate the book because it constantly bombarded me with product placements and notions of status based on material wealth. I couldn't fathom how this could be conveyed through dialogue between two characters on screen.<br/><br/>I was surprised how well the film was executed.  Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman in a performance that seemed to have manifest out of my imagination while i was reading the book. He seemed to dissolve into the character.  His physical presence was exceptional, with his facial expressions, body language, and tone of speech.  He gave Patrick multiple dimensions as not only a sadistic killer, but a faceless member of a society so defined by the material, that the inner never really shows through.<br/><br/>
This point is well driven home as many of the characters have no idea who they are really talking to from one moment to the next.  They know the people to speak, criticize, and gossip about them, but they have no idea what they really look like, even if they are speaking to them.  Patrick has conversations about himself with other people who have confused him with some other interchangeable member of the social circle.  It's quite funny to watch.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely funny at times and extremely gory at others.  The violence is REALLY toned down from the book, but what remains is still the gory aftermath of that violence, which is significant.  Add to the fact that once you are left to imagine the violent act itself, it suddenly becomes ten times as vivid.  This film is not for the fragile or faint of heart.  Take heed.<br/><br/>The story is as it is in the book, non linear.  There is no real beginning or end.  It's just a story about this person, and the horrible things he does.  There are some traditional plot mechanisms thrown in to give the movie some sense of linear progression, and they work well, but they betray the sheer randomness of the book, which for me was one of the endearing qualities.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy a vivid lead character. The supporting cast is there, but not really.  Christian Bale carries this film from beginning to end just like Patrick Bateman did in the book.  It hinges on his believability and he responds powerfully.  He is convincing in every capacity.  Every move he makes, every word he speaks resonates the character of Patrick Bateman.  Congratulations and thanks to Christian Bale, for he made this film thoroughly enjoyable for me."

If only ""Satire"" could sue for defamation.<br/><br/>Smug, lame, and lacking any wit probably best describes the humor of this picture. The film makers obviously watched some Neil Labute films but the result is much closer to a Leslie Nielson film. In fact, the average Naked Gun sequel has more relevant social commentary.<br/><br/>Plot lines and characters simply disappear without any explanation (maybe Willam Defoe will have his lunch with Patrick Bateman on the DVD version).

Christian Bale gave the performance of his life and lives up to his billing as the hottest under 30's actor alive and the scene where he runs down the corridor of an apartment block bollic naked with a chainsaw was hilarious.

It was not until the last quarter of the movie when the interesting twists started occurring that it actually arrested my attention.<br/><br/>The main character's, Patrick Bateman, behaviours would be classified by medical science as psychopathic and/or sociopathic in nature, or as being mentally insane.  Whereas, most psychopaths have or appear to have no conscience, Mr. Bateman did possess some conscientiousness, at least toward the latter part of the movie.<br/><br/>Bateman experienced at least one consciousness dimensional shift as a result of the ""black hole"" effect he was experiencing in his consciousness/mind. That shift indicated by the facts that his attorney did not recognize him as Bateman but as Davis, the attorney's knowledge that Paul Allen was alive in his (the attorney's) reality, the apartment where Allen had resided and which was then under remodeling, the real estate representative's apparent knowledge of more than one existence/dimension evidenced by her statements to Bateman wherein she requested him to cause no trouble, to leave, and to not return.<br/><br/>Mr. Bateman wanted, needed, and attempted to get help for his dilemma evidenced by his statement to his secretary on the telephone, ""I need help Jean, I don't think I'm going to make it"" to which she essentially ignored until later and his statement to his girlfriend, ""I need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale.  It cannot be corrected but I have no other way to fulfill my needs"", to which she also ignored as well as ignoring the drawing he was making at the dining table in the restaurant. The poor fellow was surrounded by egomaniacs who were totally engrossed in themselves only.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman's statements at the very ending of the movie illustrate his confusion, frustration, and lack of knowledge concerning the reality(ies) he found himself in.<br/><br/>This is a movie which deals with immortality, infinity, free will, and a host of other esoteric-related philosophies, as well as some quantum mechanics physics' theories.<br/><br/>Under the circumstances, it was impossible for me to not feel human compassion for this gentleman who found himself in a loop in hell with no obvious way out, to his present knowledge."

","I just watched American Psycho. Right now I'm a little confused, a little shocked and frankly worried that I'm not feeling as numb as I should be.<br/><br/>When the book came out, I avoided it. All of the negative publicity, and the shrink wrap plastic cover turned me off. A lot of column inches were filled analyzing the horror of American Psycho. I didn't feel like I was missing much. The release of the film largely passed me by. Tonight, well tonight I'm not sure why I watched it. It was just starting on the wide-screen movie channel as I clicked by; for some reason I stayed. And I was glad I did.<br/><br/>I tend to like black comedies, but it's so hard to get the tone right. For every ""Heathers"" there are a dozen stinkers with an over-stated ironic sensibility that you endure rather than enjoy (Did somebody mention Terry Gilliam?) I don't believe in 'anything goes' - but this is a funny film. There were moments of satirical absurdity which just boggled the mind and yet, and this is the odd part, were so damnably tasteful. They really pulled it off.<br/><br/>For a film based on a book notorious for its unrestrained portrayal of homicidal violence, there is something very restrained about American Psycho. We don't see a lot of actual violence. The real anger is reserved for Brett Easton Ellis' critique of Eighties excess. An easy target? Perhaps, but the real genius of the thing is that we empathise with the villain of the piece. Like Milton's Satan, the apparently amoral anti-hero is the most attractive character in the film. We like him, despite, and occasionally because of the actions we would normally condemn. That's a real achievement.<br/><br/>And the ending? Well, I didn't see that coming. A real surprise. I'm still not sure how we are supposed to read the story in light of that revelation. What's the point of the film if we can't trust anything we've seen? Why should we trust the ending? I don't have any answers for you. Maybe you should read the book. Maybe I should."

"stemage","4","0","1","22 October 2001"," Great idea, great book, not enough movie
","The concept behind American Psycho is an original one, and it is THAT concept that encouraged most people to see it, but it's just so underdeveloped.  There IS some development as far as our ""one"" character is concerned, but most of his ramblings don't explain his strange condition anymore than his actions do (if that makes sense).  Those seeking explanation and understanding of the main character are left with much to be desired, while people just sitting through the movie are left totally confused (but forget those people, this is an artsy flic).  The last line of the movie tries to explain it all in a single blow cutting to the credits even before you really get a chance to consider what he just said.  American Psycho takes the format of a thriller or horror with lulls in between scenes of climactic events.  Basically, while most of these movies put the viewer through a series of situations furthering the plot making you think more, only to be resolved (or somewhat resolved) in the end, this feature sends the mood up and down while explaining nothing.  You never understand what the motivation is behind the murders at ALL, which is understandable if that was the intent, but NO motivation can sometimes translate to the viewer as NO plot, and that is simply the case.  The movie ends with a line that should knock you in the gut and make you love the movie and understand the character, but rather makes you shake your head and want to start the whole thing over to find something tangible.  It is beautifully filmed, and the confession scene is oscar worthy, but overall, the movie shoves itself across the boundaries of ""artsy"" and right of the cliff into nothing. Definitely worth the watch, but it's not life changing."

Instead it carefully builds a very controlled sense of panic, as Bateman (the protagonist) struggles with the schism between his daytime persona and nightime behaviour. This means when the film does change gears it's a genuine shock. Top marks for direction.<br/><br/>Like Fight Club, it's an interesting study of violent desires (from a very different angle, although there's still the identity, branding and schitzoid themes), and like Fight Club the people who will enjoy and understand it most will probably be driven away by it's ""Slasher"" title."

","I had high hopes for 'American Psycho' but was largely disappointed. Anyone who has read the book and can still praise this movie is a fool. The whole thing reeks of compromise to me. The book was a satire on 80s yuppie rampant consumerism true, but ALSO an examination of violence. By emphasizing the satire and down-playing the violence (there is very little, and it is largely implied), Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have turned what could have been a milestone EVENT of confrontational cinema into an average comedy with a few laughs, and less blood than an 'Evil Dead' or Romero zombie flick. While I understand it would be impossible to film the most extreme scenes in the book, I still think more disturbing images were required to make this more than say, The Cell or Hannibal. The audience I watched this with laughed at the corporate culture and Huey Lewis jokes, but they also laughed at Bateman running around with a chainsaw, just like it was Itchy and Scratchy. No-one was DISTURBED or CONFRONTED. Is this the way it was meant to be??<br/><br/>What 'American Psycho' needed was David Cronenberg say, or (and I can't believe I'm typing this!) Oliver Stone. Yeah, Mr.Subtle. But 'American Psycho' ISN'T a subtle book, and the movie cries out for the vision Stone showed in 'J.F.K' and closer to home, 'Natural Born Killers', not the watered-down, playing-it-safe mediocrity we have here.<br/><br/>I must, however, praise Christian Bale's largely excellent William Shatner-esque performance.

But, back to the movie at hand. This was the film that most intrigued me out of that trio above. It was certainly the most gory (not much competition!) but it was both profoundly disturbing, incredibly funny, and wonderfully brought to life. I've not read the novel, but if anything were to convince me to give it a go, it was this film. Basically what so intrigued me about the film was the way it worked on so many different levels - thriller, magic realist, gothic, satire...It was really about (I would venture) our complete over investment in surface, to the point where small details seem meaningful and we entirely loose sight of the bigger picture (see especially the business card scenes, but also the repetition of masks, nouvelle cuisine presentation of food, minimalist furnishings etc). Anyway, a big hurrah to the entire cast, especially Willem Defoe as the spooky inspector (real, or a figment of Bateman's imagination?) and Christian Bale.

Or, a person could sit there dumbfounded for the first half of the movie until they get tired of trying to figure out what the point of it is, and leave to go get some take-out and go watch something good on TV.  I mean, seriously, this may be an attempt to twist our minds and shock us, but there are waaaay better movies a person can rent for that. The movie had very little plot, Bateman's evolving dementia was hardly believable, and the constant mention of ""Restaurant Reservations"" as the definitive status symbol for the 80's businessman was over-killed in the first 10 minutes.  If you really want to see this movie, wait for the VHS, or better yet, the DVD, which I'm sure will be marketed with some sort of ""Extra Uncut Footage"" or ""Special Edition"" packaging for an extra $10."

","I don't know quite what to do with this movie. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a young, Wall Street powerbroker type who, in his spare time, enjoys critiquing albums, kinky sex and murder - and not necessarily in that order! Bale - the only actor in the movie of any significance - is actually rather good in the part, as he shows Bateman descending farther and farther into insanity, finally reaching out for help but not being able to find anyone who believes him. He goes a little overboard at times, but then again that's in keeping with the character.<br/><br/>My basic problem with the movie was that I didn't think it ever decided where it wanted to go. It's publicized as a thriller, and as a thriller it's absolutely awful. I first thought that it might be a serious attempt to construct a psychological profile of a serial killer. Forget that. There's no serious attempt to do anything in this movie. It doesn't work too well as a straight thriller either, for one simple reason: there's nothing particularly frightening about it! It simply contains the normal slasher-type violence you would expect in this genre, and, of course, grotesquely mutilated bodies pop up in the most unexpected places - except that, because we've seen these types of movies before, we expect them to pop up! But, on the other hand, maybe this could be looked at as one of those ""thrillers"" that's so bad it's actually funny. (Or, maybe it's actually intended to be a black comedy. If so, it's not too bad.) And, at times, it really is funny! Let's just say that I spent far more time laughing than I did perched on the edge of my seat!<br/><br/>Aside from Bale's performance (and I'm still not sure if he put on a great comedic performance or a lousy dramatic performance) the supporting cast was mediocre. Willem Dafoe had little to do in the role of Donald Kimball, a police detective who seems to be suspicious of Bateman as he investigates one of the murders, but then seems to do little to follow up on his suspicions except take Bateman out to lunch. The best performance of the weak supporting cast was probably that of Cara Seymour as the prostitute Christie, who becomes a participant in Bateman's kinky games.<br/><br/>So, again, what to do with this? Maybe just forget it and ""return the video?"" (You have to have seen the movie to understand that reference.) Or maybe that's too harsh. I mean, it isn't terrible; it's just not very good. The combination of a lousy thriller and a not-so-bad comedy (and, I might add, that either way it falls apart with what I thought was a terribly weak ending) gives this a rating of 4/10."

","American Psycho is film about greed, power vanity and how a psycho killer sees the world. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman a man who spends hours on his physical appearance but does not communicate on an emotional level with those around him his one true pleasure killing and maiming women (and sometimes men too) To describe this film as a black comedy would be an understatement, however as well as being a rather gruesome film the movie is full of biting sarcasm about the rootless money motivated business world of the eighties. The film uses its central character Bateman as a kind of amalgamation of its self obsorbtion and vanity. He plays  vain company stock broker. He engages in some brutal acts of violence and depraved sexual acts as well but the main back bone of the film is Bateman's analysis of his world where he sees nothing but greed, some of his monologues about his personal habits and music choices are hilarious. The supporting cast is made from his girlfriend and mistress (Reece Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis) and his business colleges Jared Leto as Paul Allen and Willam Defo as Detective Kimball also give good performances. While some may find it distaseful because of its rather over the top (intentionally) violence it is still a well scripted disenction of the power obsessed '80s through the eyes of a deranged killer. In the end Christian Bales performance as Bateman and several funny scenes as well as the main psycho narrative make it an enjoyable and effective film while never being a Classic.<br/><br/>***1/2/*****"

","Okay, I'm usually a fan of pretentious films which other people find to be boring and plotless, but I have to say that this movie was in fact boring and plotless.  Not to mention pointless and valueless.  It seemed to be about an hour and forty-five minutes of gratuitous violence wrapped up at the end with an extreme copout of a twist.  The violence wasn't especially graphic really, there just happened to be a lot of it implied off screen and so forth with very little else of consequence occurring in the film.  The movie is nearly devoid of likeable characters, save perhaps Chloe Sevigny's and Willem Dafoe's characters, both of whom are as underdeveloped as all of the other characters in the film, alleged protagonist included.  I have to say that the complete nothing of a script was fairly well acted and well shot.  If these scenes could somehow be reassembled and added to in a manner which would produce a compelling story or anything at all for the viewer to identify with, perhaps it could have been an excellent film.  Alas, I find it difficult to enjoy a film which has no semblance of a plot or point and therefore have to recommend that if you never see this film, it will be too soon.  It's seemingly an attempt at giving the appearance of a smart and arty film and while visually it does have some art worth commending, it lacks any real intelligence or insight.  It's got an anti-hero and an anti-ending which by all means deserve your efforts to anti-see it.<br/><br/>2/10"

","I knew there was a reason why I hated this film. I made the mistake of giving it a second look because I like Christian Bale, but it was just as awful the second time around. There were only positive things I found ""American Psycho"" possessed;, Christian Bale's performance and the fact that it was over in less than two hours. <br/><br/>At least ""American Psycho"" served one positive purpose, which was the fact that it starred one of the brightest new stars in Christian Bale, whose performance was incredible. The performance of Christian Bale was excellent because I enjoyed how he carried himself. Almost in a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde way, Bale suavely did his thing at night to get his craving.<br/><br/>While I hated this movie, I think that Christian Bale should get nominated for his performance of the devilish, sly, cunning, smooth talking and clever Patrick Batemen. I can not say much for the performances of the rest of the cast they were beyond awful, they were a waste of time ad expense for the producers and directors.<br/><br/>There were reasons why I didn't like the film the first time around. From the lack of creativity in the plot to the stupidity of the writers for making us think there was a reason for putting so many violent scenes in the film. This is not a film to be proud of for everyone associated with this film from the cast to the crew. <br/><br/>This marks the second time I have seen ""American Psycho"" and it still pains me to see good actors in a bad movie.

","Prior to the film's release I remember reading an interview with director Mary Harron who was commenting on the rumor that Leonardo DiCaprio was supposed to star in American Psycho.  She stated it would be totally wrong and ruin the book for what it is.  After watching this movie, I can say that its the director and her whole crew who ruined a book which could have been made into a good movie.  First off, the movie has no feel to it..one would think it would be easy to re-create New York in the 80's..instead it is so obvious that its Toronto being substituted for NY and the director's lack of attention to detail ruins many shots.  Extra's have 1999 clothes, haircuts and I could swear I saw an extra with the latest model cell phone in the back ground.  In addition, the manner in which it was shot felt like I was watching a Canadian made for T.V. afterschool special.  <br/><br/>Secondly, besides the faults of the set director, etc. The casting director should never work again!  Christian Bale delivers such a mediocre and dull performance its a wonder how he ever made it into acting.  This is the type of role an actor could really set his mark with for years to come...instead Bale proves that either he is not ready for these kinds of role's or he's just not made for serious roles.  The director refused to cast a big name in the starring role...little did she realize that there is a reason Leonardo Dicaprio, Edward Norton and Matt Damon are paid the big ""bucks""..they can act and deliver amazing performances.  When she can finally look beyond her ""Hollywood is evil!"" approach she might start making decent movies and not ruin a good book. If you have not seen this movie..avoid it...its a TERRIBLE attempt at making something different and original..in my opinion..the director was too novice for this type of film and really had no clue where to go with it! Avoid this movie!!"

","The first five minutes of this movie summarise 90% of it. A bunch of people talking pointlessly about nothing special. The worst were the commentaries on 80's music during supposedly key scenes. Christian Bale does a fine acting job with the material he is given, and if you enjoy an actor doing the best with weak material, particularly when he has a well-maintained body that is shown off a fair amount, there may still be something to look for here. Put him in a suit and have him yammer endlessly and I'd confuse him with other faceless drones just like some in the movie do.<br/><br/>But this movie really isn't all that, it isn't that shocking or disturbing, and we never even really get to know any of the characters... especially the lead. Frankly I know more interestingly psychotic people in my everyday life, though as far as I know none of them have killed. The most interesting person in the movie to me was the guy's assistant, and halfway through the movie discovered I'd much rather hear her story.<br/><br/>I've heard some say they don't like how this movie ended. I liked the ending just fine: The credits rolled, I put my hands in the air and said 'Thank God it's over!' and turned it off. Not the worst movie I've seen I'm sure, but seemingly the longest 1:43 minute movie ever. Maybe if Mr. Bale had shown off his well-sculpted form throughout the whole feature it would have been worth a few more stars.<br/><br/>It does bug me though -- why do so many directors think that mental illness and having a character exercising in the nude go so well together? At least a half-dozen movies right off have used that connection. So you out there, if you've recently found yourself doing your morning stretches in the nude, get some therapy before its too late!!! :-)"

Another one to add to the long list of them.  I generally like the killer films, unless there's something really bad with them.  When I saw American Psycho the first thing that came to mind as that it wasn't quite what I expected, it was a lot better.  It is a combination of seriousness with surrealness, lunacy and brutality in the darkest of black comedies I've ever seen (a combination I'd never seen all in the same movie).  When I left the cinema it actually took a couple of days to decide whether I liked it or not.  Then I will say that I liked it a lot, it was a strangley pleasing film, probably because you can actually relate to it in a way.  How many times have you bought something and found out someone you know has gone one better.

But somehow all of that has gotten into his mind and seriously screwed him up. He is just emotionless, greedy and narcissistic. That is about everything this film is about, it is a movie about the lifestyle of an eighties yuppie. There is not much more to it, because the film lacks excitement, graphic display of Bateman's deeds and explanation. I think the latter can be obtained by watching the film for the second time, but for the rest, you'll probably have to read the book. What killed' this movie though was it's lack of excitement (fear of Bateman or even thrills when you start wondering what he is up to next). This film is no classic at all, though I think it could have been, if Stanley Kubrick had directed it (even in the same way), for it reminds me a hell of a lot of A Clockwork Orange and because everything Kubrick made is regarded as a masterpiece (although I often do not get why). Without having read the book I can advise you, read it first and then, maybe watch this movie, for the special think about this story could not even be screwed up by the director, whereas the rest could be.

","I may be in a decided minority in feeling that Mary Harron has, thus far, built a career on draining all excitement from her material. I Shot Andy Warhol featured a number of interesting performances and a fine script, but the direction completely dulled any of the fun that you would expect from the Warhol Factory and its hangers-on. Similarly, with her adaptation of American Psycho, Harron has gotten a number of fine performances from her cast, and the writing seems sharp, but the direction is so completely without the necessary flair that it seems largely lacking as a whole.<br/><br/>Bret Easton Ellis's novel of Yuppie Decadence was only barely cutting edge when it came out. Readers have mistake Ellis's flamboyant writing style for substance, ignoring the fact that even in the mid to late 80s, social critics didn't really feel like the decade had much depth. The book is a violent satire that naysayers misread as literal, but which its cult (and it seems that thousands of people still love the book for whatever reason) have mistaken for profound. However, say what you will about it's quality, the book is either a fantastic success or a thunderous failure. It's hard to be ambivalent.<br/><br/>Harron's movie, though, can easily produce a ho-hum reaction. It seems counterproductive to mention it, but it's almost unavoidable to think of what might have happened had the film been made by Oliver Stone and Leonardo DiCaprio, who were both rumoured to be interested at one point. Stone would have been the perfect director to handle the material for better or for worse. In my opinion, Stone probably would have made a horrible, flashy, loud, misguided movie, much in the tradition of Brian DePalma's awe-inspiringly wrong-headed Bonfire of the Vanities. But he could have made the film another Wall Street, a brilliant satire. Similarly, it's very possible that DiCaprio would have been so miscast as to make the film laughable. Or he may have given a wonderful and unexpected performance. Regardless, the film would have been alive.<br/><br/>It's not really Harron's fault that the material is dated. Ellis at least was working in his contemporary milieu. Some of his observations may have seemed biting. For Harron to mine humour from the killer's passion for Phil Collins seems counter productive. The jokes are just obvious. American Psycho has no more currency than any other piece of 80s parody or nostalgia. It's more like Romy and Michelle Kill Everyone at Their High School Reunion.<br/><br/>But the film still remains watchable. And, even more surprising,  after being forced to watch the film a second time, it didn't get any worse, as such surface glosses often tend to. Christian Bale's performance is a comedic masterwork, a super combination of flawlessly dark line readings and chilling physical comedy. Bale certainly has never had so much fun in a film before and it's doubtful that he'll ever get such juicy material again. Willem Defoe is similarly relishes his role as a slightly daffy private eye. However, in keeping with the piece, much of the rest of the cast seems to be sleepwalking through their performances. Samantha Mathis, Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, and Jared Leto all play desicated characters, so it isn't surprising that none of them have the chance to do their best work.<br/><br/>American Psycho is violent, but not overwhelmingly so. It's sexual, but not enough to really offend anybody. And it's intense, but probably not enough to endanger old hearts. The question with Ellis's book was always whether or not it could be adapted for the screen. Well, clearly it can be. The only question remaining is whether Mary Harron should have bothered.<br/><br/>I'd give it a generous 6/10, largely because it didn't bore me the second time around."

Identity is a hard thing to come by in his Wall Street world, even for his male colleagues, with their unexplained misogynism.  Work, living address, clothes, restaurants frequented and particularly the design of one's business card are vital means for providing this.  Attempting to explain the point of everything to his fiancee, Bateman says in his careful pronunciation, ""Because I want to fit in.""<br/><br/>Bateman's story is complicated by his increasing insanity.  He tells us that he's very aware that he's not what he pretends to be.  But he's unaware in his storytelling that much if not all of his overpowering, murderous mental state is not really acted out.  We know this because of the completely outrageous and careless way his crimes are committed.  And secondly his desperate point blank confessions lack supporting physical evidence or response from his listener.  These confessions and Bateman's efforts to maintain composure produce a degree of pathos for a wretched and despicable character.<br/><br/>There are dark humorous touches in the movie.

I just got through working for another one a few months ago, a total and (quite typical)Hollywood A--hole who made Sh--loads of money and drove a Porsche and even had the good looking bitch girlfriend,  being an A--hole 24 hours a day. These people are part of what America produces, unfortunately, and rewards, and a film that satirizes them even semi-effectively is, therefore, valuable. SPOILER ALERT And by the way, in case there are people out there who still haven't figured it out: most of the film is a fantasy going on in Bale's head which by pushing the hatreds and prejudices going on in his head to their logical extremes and showing them in 'acted-out' form serves as an allegory for the more insidious 'spiritual' and less obvious 'murders' being committed by these types of characters on a daily basis, now, today, as well as all through recent and not-so-recent history"

"Starbuck-13","4","0","1","30 October 2000"," Unnecessary brutality
","I'm still a little bit unsure about what exactly this movie wants to express.<br/><br/>Does it simply want to shock us with the evil which ""lurks inside the hearts of men"" (to quote ""The Shadow"")?<br/><br/>Does it want to show the inner demons of a mentally departed, totally insane man?<br/><br/>Does it want to portray the incredible fact that in a faceless society, murder goes unpunished?<br/><br/>To be true, the last suggestion seems a little bit hard to swallow. Neither do I believe that even superficial Yuppies are so unable to tell apart the faces of their colleagues (having myself an extremely well memory of faces, this strikes me as even more impossible), nor do I believe that such a murder spree would not be noticed by anybody. <br/><br/>Of course, the story does not want to portray the whole murder spree realistically - it wants to speak to us in metaphorical ways and you know what? It fails.<br/><br/>The movie left me confused in the end and disgusted in the middle. I believe that there is enough brutality in this world, it does not need films like this or ""Natural born killers"" or any others which portray serial killers.<br/><br/>Though the movie was sometimes good, especially in the first 30 minutes showing life and decadence of Bateman, it turned into a piece of gore the longer it took.<br/><br/>The actors did great jobs - especially Christian Bale, whose face became a mask of insanity - but still, it failed to deliver a decent message."

","I must first confess that I read the book before I saw the movie and loved it. And certain parts of the movie were better than the book. I like the way the way Mary Harron took out a lot of the gore and made it more satirical sounding than the book did (you have to really think about the book to realize that it is a satire, while the movie made it obvious). For example, in the book Patrick Bateman talks about music that he loves in chapters that are seemingly just thrown into the book, while the movie makes them integral parts of certain scenes. Also, the fact reminds that this movie is pro-feminist, regardless of what has been written about it. Mary Harron, the director is mocking the way men act, and seems to say that homicidal rag is something more men would turn to if given the chance. While I don't recommend this movie for everyone, it is is still a very solid movie. Christian Bale is spectacular, Reese Weatherspoon plays her role well and Matt Ross is excellent as well. The other actors are somewhat forgettable, but I still give this movie an 8 out of 10."

It could have gone two ways, into a sharp, biting satire (like, say, ""The Player"") or into a more disturbed, unsettling comedy (like ""Parents"").  Sadly, it floundered somewhere in the middle and delivered neither a rewarding comedy nor an involving psychological thriller.

"movieman-46","10","0","1","20 September 2000"," Slasher, with style and wit.
","American Psycho is a rare and refreshing movie that breathes new life into the horror film genre.  However, to call American Psycho simply a slasher film, is wrong.  This film rises above all genres to become an instant classic.  Ever since the original Scream, killer movies have tried to follow a very familiar and formulaic path.  American Psycho delivers all the horror, but still tells an intriguing psychological tale of a killer in the 1980's.<br/><br/>American Psycho tells the story of Patrick Bateman.  Bateman works on Wall Street, and is basically a rich yuppie trying to fit in.  He listens to all the latest music, like Huey Lewis and the News, and does 1,000 crunches every day.  This is Patrick Bateman by day.  By night, he must satisfy a terrible blood lust.<br/><br/>Patrick Bateman is played brilliantly by Christian Bale.  Bale displays Bateman with an absolute coldness.  It is as if the only humanity displayed by him is when he is killing someone.  I think that Christian Bale is someone to be watched and I see Oscars in his future.  He takes on a role which he describes as being, ""an acting teachers nightmare.""  Christian Bale, however, is an absolute dream as Patrick Bateman.  To think that the role originaly belonged to Leonardo DiCaprio.  Nobody else could have played Bateman except Christian Bale.<br/><br/>American Psycho is masterfully directed by Mary Harron.  She injects the film with a sort of style that is all its own.  Not only style, but substance.  Every scene hints at the psychological make-up of Patrick Bateman.  It's very kinetic, as it rises faster and faster to an unbelievable climax.  <br/><br/>Overall, American Psycho is a must-see movie for those who have the stomach for it.  If possible, see the unrated version, as it shows Mary Harron's true vision."

","The film of the infamous 80's yuppie culture novel is a different affair to the blood soaked, sickeningly twisted and violent book. Anyone who has read the text should be aware of the unsuitability of some of the torture scenes to be filmed. There is violence in this picture but, as is often stated in other reviews, the feel of the film has been (I would say un-subtly) feminised. Christian Bale plays Bateman with a natural slickness, my only criticism of this characterisation is a (at times) slightly ropy accent. Although the plot is the same as the book, I certainly think that the ending doesn't work so well on screen, which could be said about the entire film.<br/><br/>The book was about violence, anonymity, Patrick's decent into madness and perhaps ultimately a psychosis even further removed than the supposed reality he exists in. In the film this cracking up is handled like a farce in a mid-life-crisis comedy. This takes the edge of the satire.<br/><br/>Good Film, as always, perhaps more so than usual, far inferior to the book. still in its own right its worth 7/10"

","American Psycho is Mary Harron's restrained directorial adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's novel about 1980s excess, seen through the eyes of a yuppie serial killer. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works on Wall Street, but he's so bland in appearance that his fiancee (Reese Witherspoon) calls him the ""boy next door"" and most of his colleagues continually mistake him for someone else. Bateman is rich enough not to work, and receives an exorbitant salary  for doing very little. His devoted secretary (Chloe Sevigny) is kept busy booking lunch and dinner reservations for him and his fiancee, mistress (Samantha Mathis) or misogynist buddies at the trendiest restaurants. Always dressed in designer clothing, he spends the rest of the time at his health and fitness club or at the laundrette - trying to get the bloodstains off his sheets.<br/><br/>American Psycho is about Bateman's psychopathic urges spiralling out of control, but the clever screenplay (by Harron and Guinevere Turner) makes it clear he doesn't kill indiscriminately. Bateman is a metaphor for privileged male elites raping and murdering America's homeless, gays, non-whites and women. Harron's film is a lot more audience-friendly than Ellis's book. Christian Bale introduces some welcome goofy mannerisms to his characterisation of the title role. And most of the violence is toned down or takes place out of shot. But Harron is too genteel with her direction; unwilling to have much fun satirising 1980s America. The expensive apartments and restaurants don't look glamorous, they look washed-out. Was this deliberate or a lack of money? More significantly, the dialogue often feels truncated (it doesn't get a chance to flow), so the film isn't as funny as the book. In its favour, it builds to more of a crescendo than the book, and you're not left wondering what the point of it all was."

The opening scene with Bateman taking off his skin care mask was great- under this mask he is wearing another one, a mask which isolates him from any type of human contact. The film refers, although in an ironic way,to the discussion about the postmodern man, who is what he wears. As Bateman himself claims: ""the modern man cannot feel anything but disgust and greed"". I found the film very depressing- there is no ""real"" world or identity; everything we have is our own conception of the word.<br/><br/>There are also other interesting comments about modern culture in the film. The references to Psycho and a Clockwork Orange are obvious.<br/><br/>
I liked the way that the film was arranged. The director didn't concentrate too much on the violence.

Bateman do the ""record introductions"" of the book while playing a totally another scene. Bale presents a totally believable Patrick Bateman, delivering a stunning performance. His performance sadly overcomes the performances of other actors in key roles, but this for me did not present a problem, as I viewed the film as being very lead role centric, anyway.<br/><br/>Although compared to the book the gore factor was downplayed in the movie, it was depicted in a way that conveyed well the essence of Bateman's character yet kept the movie in a class that doesn't end up being raped by censors.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very pleased by the adaptation, and can even recommend it to anyone not having read the book itself as a truly chilling horror comedy / satire."

People talk with authority about how Sikhs are killing the Jews in Sri Lanka. Slowly the hollowness of society dawns on you and you want to put an end to it. Patrick Bateman starts by putting an end to a homeless man on the street and follows it up with some of his friends and then street hookers and then anyone he meets on the road, in this Deadly Satire American Psycho. He is not seeking a solution. He is the problem. There is a hint about the crimes being Patricks figment of imagination. The scrapbook found by the secratary, the blowing up of police car in dream like fashion and lawyer's claim of having met one of the victims in London, point to that direction. Every once in a while, a director comes along and makes a movie which portrays a glossy cover but inside it is an art movie with very boring message (if you can get to it). Matrix did it for religion, Eyes Wide Shut did it for Man Woman relationship and now American Psycho does it for psuedo life of the rich on Wall Street. This is certainly not meant for people with weak heart. If a portion of your brain enjoyed Silence of the lambs, you may be qualified to see it."

","Christian Bale is excellent.  The film is excellent providing hours of laughs and conversation even after the films end.  A must see for any 80's movie buff.  Watch for some very funny scenes including how the lead actor takes care of himself, business cards and one great sex scene."

","American Psycho was one of the most unique and utterly entertaining movies I have ever seen. It had in my opinion 3 essential qualities for having a great movie: violence, sex, and comedy- making it almost flawless. It ranks up there with Pulp Fiction in its creativity and originality, along with its glamorization of violence and subsequent transformation into art. Unfortunately I think only open-minded viewers who are not afraid to experience something a little bizarre and queer will enjoy this movie. It is nowhere close to the mundane and repetitive romantic comedy, drama, and action adventure crap that pervades mainstream cinema today. Also I think the movie would be more accepted by males than females because of the strong sexual content and masculine tone to the film.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was superb in his portrayal of the killer, giving the viewer a real understanding of Patrick's need for self-gratification and perfection. In acting out his inner sexual desires, his need for seeking power and prestige, his obsession with his looks, along with the impulse to kill, we could truly understand his inherent animal instinct and better gauge his psychotic mental state. The dialogue between the characters was utterly ingenuous, making for a dark and whimsical setting, while at the same time indirectly comical and intriguing. For anyone who would like to be thoroughly entertained and amused, I strongly recommend seeing American Psycho."
"barfly99","9","0","1","15 May 2000"," Hilariously vicious satire of the 1980s.
","So let's get this straight: AMERICAN PSYCHO is pornographic and horrific, but also not shocking enough; it's dull and boring, but also overly brutal and disgusting; it crams in too much of the novel, but also not enough. Films like this just can't win when so many people insist on going to see it with such deeply entrenched expectations of exactly what kind of film it ought to be, rather than judging it on its own terms. Surely it is beyond serious dispute that Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is as compelling as you could possibly hope to see. And some moments (notably the business card scene and Patrick's meditations on various MOR musicians) are extremely funny. I can understand the gore putting off some people, but it's actually no more gory than, say, GOODFELLAS, and nobody ever seems to imply Scorsese ruined that film with graphic violence. And I find it astounding that a film that gets its point across so determinedly can be labeled ""pointless"". The portrayal of a decade of image without substance, riches without work, sex without love, and so on, represents, I would have thought, a pretty forthright ""point"", whether you agree with it or not. The film's closing monologue is merely a final reminder that sincerity has no place in a world so vacuous and empty. For me one of the funniest and most telling moments in AMERICAN PSYCHO is when Willem Dafoe, who had previously appeared to be the typically astute screen detective, turns out to be just another grinning Huey Lewis fan - perhaps with dark thoughts and urges of his own. I for one will certainly be extra careful with the next person I hear raving about Phil Collins."

","THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR (so far) AWARD.   First of all,  I have never been to a movie I wanted to walk out of so bad in my whole life.  I agree with the person who said it is like ""Clockwork Orange"" without a plot.  The movie made absolutely no sense at all.  It was a really sad excuse for a film. Sure the twist at the end was interesting, but the movie itself was such a waste of time, I surely would have rather been returning some video tapes. Nothing could save it.  A must see movie???  I think not.  A must see if you want to waste your time and money...  And if you are a very disturbed person.  I knew I should have went to see Final Destination again!  What also pisses me off is Jared Letos' part was cut really short.  I went to the movie with low expectations, and thats what I got.  It was nothing but a disappointment.  I don't recommend this to anyone.  I give it a 2 out of a 10."

","I liked Christian Bale in ""Empire of the Sun"", he was only 13 then but it was a powerful and inspiring performance. He attacks this role with the same enthusiasm but his character is so despicable it's impossible to care. Two other great actors, Willem Dafoe and Reese Witherspoon are wasted in roles that aren't much more than cameos.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone would go to see this film expecting a romantic comedy, but this movie conjures up adjectives such as 'pornographic', 'sick' and 'perverted'. If only I could use the word 'disturbing', maybe then we'd have a film worth seeing, but I'm afraid I'll have to settle for 'disgusting'!"
"francijb","Null","0","1","30 April 2000"," A Clockwork Orange with no point
","There is absolutely no reason to see this movie.  Quite possibly, it was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen.  I enjoyed taking my younger brother to the Pokemon movie more than this dud.  The movie seems to be similar to A Clockwork Orange right down to the threesome orgy scene.  The only difference is, A Clockwork Orange is entertaining.  If only Stanley Kubrick were still alive, maybe he could have saved this ludicrously contrived movie.  The movie had basically no plot, no conflict despite the miserable attempt to create it through a quasi police investigation, no suspense, no shock, not once through the movie did I, or anyone else around jump or shriek in horror.  Most people leaving the theater echoed my feelings. Essentially, i lost 2 hours of my life I will never get back."
"kevin c","5","0","1","2 May 2000"," HIP TO BE SQUARE
","The first hour of this film is very good. Bale manages to make Bateman both amusing, repulsive and boring. In steering away from the violence and concentrating on the excesses and faults of the 1980s, therein lies the film's problem. It begins to get a bit repetitive. Notwithstanding it's good in comparison to some of the competition, and the ending perfectly concludes what we've learnt about Bateman."

","Okay, so maybe not.  American Psycho was quite an interesting show with a subtle twist in the end that will probably leave most movie-goers with a ""Huh?"" look on their face.<br/><br/>Christian Bale played the part of Patrick Bateman perfectly.  To think that Leonard Dicaprio was even considered for this role is, to me at least, unfathomable.  He lacks the depth that Bale gives the part.  Also, Reese Witherspoon plays Bale's girlfriend and really shines in the short time she is in the film.  The story is well written and the casting is superb.  This is a great period piece as well...You have got to love the Eighties and the materialistic consumerism that goes along with it.  I would  recommend this movie to cynics, (and do so with a clear conscience), and people who can enjoy a good film laced with extraordinary amounts of blood.  I gave this film an ""8"" mostly for Bale's job.  He made this movie."
"aggie_bear","3","0","2","25 April 2000"," Were we suppose to laugh?
","I was really excited about going to see this movie, but left wondering what had happened. Not because the plot and story were so confused, but because the entire crowed was laughing. If I'm not mistaken this wasn't meant to be a comedy. Oh thats right, the concept was great, but the execution left something to be desired. A very deep and thought provoking movie that had lots of promise and opportunities to be great but fell way short only to be a laughable mockery.  But the NUDITY was good."
"apocalypse later","9","0","1","25 April 2000"," The Reagan Era, gutted.
","It's an intriguing, if fairly shallow, premise - cross the protagonists of ""American Gigolo"" (Julian Kaye) and ""Psycho"" (Norman Bates) - and offer up the adventures of a designer-clad ""American Psycho"" (Patrick Bateman) as a satire on soulless 1980s consumerism and social hypocrisy.  It works, though not as complexely as such other recent social allegories as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Crash,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Fight Club"" and ""American Beauty"" - and, like those films, not for everyone."
"lavendr","Null","0","1","23 April 2000"," crap on wheels
","this movie was about as bad as any i've seen. the supposed-to-be-artsy-and-disturbing cinematic techniques were a cheap clockwork orange ripoff, down to the dispassionate voice-overs and sweating, trembling extreme close ups. sad thing is, this movie could have been excellent, if the viewer had gotten any actual insight into bateman's psychology. unfortunately, pulsating forehead veins, heavy breathing, and intense, fixated eyes just aren't enough."
"Afracious","8","0","2","25 April 2000"," A darkly humorous and ambiguous satire
","Patrick Bateman is a twenty seven year old wealthy businessman, who resides in a modern chic apartment. He grooms himself with skin lotions, and likes to look his best. But he is not satisfied, because he likes to kill people. An old tramp, prostitutes, and a fellow worker(or does he?) The film is laden with little clues, and the ending makes you think. Bateman can't hide his guilt, but nobody seems interested that he kills people. It is a satire on the eighties, including some good music from that decade, Bateman giving us some info on his favorite artists of the time. There are not many graphic scenes, but one where Bateman is running after a hooker in his apartment with a chainsaw stands out. Christian Bale is perfect as Bateman, suave and softly spoken, and believable as the deranged killer. It's also darkly amusing. One to watch."
"cornchip69","9","0","1","23 April 2000"," Murders and executions
","First off, I'd like to say that this movie was not at all what I had expected it to be...from the reviews of the film I had read, I was expecting something that most critics would find tacky and overdrawn (I don't often agree with the critics), but was very surprised to find a hip, catchy movie. This film is already becoming a cult classic.  Bale's portrayal of the eccentric Bateman is almost flawless;  as you watch the movie, you can even sympathize with Bateman and almost want to be the hip, smooth talking, musically inclined money man himself (that is, until he starts to really lose himself).  Also, as a side note, I thought Reese Witherspoon was exceptional in this movie, peeking in a role that she was born to play. This movie certainly isn't for everyone, and a lot of people won't enjoy/understand it, but it's probably one of the better movies I've seen in the past two years."
"chain67","8","0","1","22 April 2000"," Very Smooth but gory thriller
","American Psycho is a classic in it's own mind. Yes some people like myself might enjoy it, some people will be disgusted by it and some people will hail it as a masterpiece, but overall this is just a very smooth, stylish and entertaining bloodbath.<br/><br/>   But for a bloodbath with a lot of nudity American Psycho has a coherent story, excellent acting and a chilling if not satisfying conclusion. Give 90% of this movies credit to Christian Bale who is excellent as Patrick Bateman the very cool, handsome and smooth wallstreet trader who by night kills for fun. <br/><br/>   The novel could of been translated better had Mary Harron not tried so hard to avoid an NC-17 and cut many scenes. Willem Dafoe gets quite annoying at times as the detective on Bateman's trail and Jared Leto is perfectly cast as smooth trader Paul Allen who has a nicer business card than Bateman. Witherspoon is average as Bateman's fiance Evelyn. <br/><br/>   This movie won't please horror fans as much as it will please fans of smooth, entertaining thrillers. Overall 9 out of 10"
