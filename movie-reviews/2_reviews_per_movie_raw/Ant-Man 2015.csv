","Ant-Man is great Heist film disguised as a superhero film. With great performances all around, I'm surprised it doesn't get the attention it deserves. Definitely a must-see-movie."

","Antman. When I first heard about the plans for this movie I laughed to myself and thought, ""How can becoming smaller be cool?"" Sure enough, Marvel has surpassed my expectations and turned something I thought would be lame and uninteresting into something hilarious and actually pretty cool. I'm not going to include any spoilers, but I will say the fighting style of Antman is much better than I thought it would be. I learned a lot about the story as well as the abilities he has. <br/><br/>Antman gets much more interesting when doing combat. The ability to shrink and grow at will is something Marvel has gotten very creative with. <br/><br/>The language in this film is good enough for my young children to watch. There are no F or GD bombs to ruin the mood and the moment with the family. I'd say I'd surely watch it again."
"lukehiggs","9","205","350","19 July 2015"," I was not expecting this... Brilliant addition to the MCU.
","AntMan is a lesser know character of marvels but by no means does that effect the quality of this movie. First off I thought that the casting of this film wasn't going to work, that been Paul Rudd mainly, just because I have read a few of the AntMan comics and didn't think it was going to work, I was wrong he is brilliant, hilarious and believable, all of the jokes he made actually made laugh out load which doesn't happen much. Michael Pena was great in this film, he plays the same kind of character he always seems too, but it really works, especially the story telling scenes were hilarious. This was a all round well cast film.<br/><br/>The action and CGI Was great, on first thoughts I thought when AntMan shrinks down that the CGI would take you out of the movie but let me tell you it doesn't, it's awesome! Especially seeing the world from that size and scenes where AntMan is shrinking and enlarging when fighting i thought would get a little too much but the honestly don't.<br/><br/>All around I AntMan felt different to all the other MCU movies that have come out, but a good different.    A well cast,directed and acted film that will be a welcome addition to my marvel collection."

","OK, so I will probably target the wrath of a legion of fan-boys but as a PhD Physicist I will categorically state that much of the science in the Marvel universe is total nonsense. For example, it requires a certain suspension of belief that whole cities can be levitated. But it's called ""Science Fiction"" for a reason, right? ""Ant Man"" pushes that suspension of belief to whole new levels. The concept that a miniaturised man, were such a thing even possible, could exert the same moment and force as a full sized person would make Newton spin in his grave.<br/><br/>With these nagging doubts I watched the trailer increasingly comfortable in my view that, (even with a free cinema pass), this was a film I would avoid like the plague. That was until the final scene, featuring Thomas the Tank engine, that was ludicrously and surprisingly comical. Could it be that, like last year's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", Marvel had pulled its pompous head out of its ass and come up with an 'Avengers-lite' that could entertain a broader audience? I decided to risk it. And I was glad I did.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd (""Friends"", ""Anchorman"") plays ex-con Scott Lang who is recruited by brilliant scientist and would-be superhero Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his gorgeous daughter Hope (""Lost"" and ""The Hobbit""'s Evangeline Lilly) to steal a jacket. (No, really). The owner of said jacket, albeit a high-tech jacket, is businessman and all-round bad-guy Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), with evil intent. (You can tell he's evil by what he does to a cute little lamb - this is the worst viewing for sheep since ""Far from the Madding Crowd"".) By miniaturising Lang and securing the help of an army of ants, the stage is set for a heist of a most unusual kind.<br/><br/>This sounds ridiculous to even write. So why does it work? First up, the script by Edgar Wright ( of ""3 Flavours Cornetto"" fame), Adam McKay (""The Other Guys""), Joe Cornish and Paul Rudd himself is as tight as a drum, with some situations and lines that are downright hilarious. A couple of brilliant lip sync scenes, one featuring the requisite Stan Lee cameo, are grin-inducing pleasures.<br/><br/>Supporting the screenplay, the three leading players pull off their roles with enormous panache. Rudd is hugely likable, with all of the smart-whip humour of Downey Jnr.'s ""Iron Man"" but with none of the appalling arrogance. Michael Douglas, in his one outing this year, seems to be revelling in his role and (presumably with the help of some clever makeup and/or CGI) looking very dapper in the 1987 version of his character. And Evangeline Lilly enters the Avenger's world with a bang and looks very comfortable there. In an effective supporting role, Michael Peña (""American Hustle"") adds a comic lightness of touch as fellow robber Luis. Abby Ryder Fortson also deserves special mention (and an Oscar for cuteness) as Lang's young daughter.<br/><br/>Whilst real fan-boys might object to the flippant nature of the film, there are a number of clever cross-overs into the 'mainstream' ""Avengers"" films, with one B-list Avenger guest star and (eventually) an A-list appearance. And (as is common in these films, and notable as 80% of the audience stayed in their seats for the full credits) there is both a mid-credits scene (that's a set-up for the sequel) and a final post-credit scene that (so I'd told) is hugely significant for next year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" (in which Rudd is set to reprise his ""Ant Man"" role).<br/><br/>The director is Peyton Reed, whose limited movie portfolio to date includes Jim Carrey's ""Yes Man"" and ""Bring it On"".<br/><br/>As I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience, my rating, against all the odds, is twice what I expected it to be. I can't believe I'm saying this but I recommend you go see this for a fun movie summer experience."
"schwarz-155-508148","9","83","142","25 September 2015"," A Great Change From Marvel's Previous Movies
","Like many people, I came into the theater wondering how Marvel would make the audience care about such a little-known character with decidedly unimpressive powers. It turns out they used the opportunity to make one of their best movies yet.<br/><br/>Ant-Man was not at all what I expected. I have been a fan of most of the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic universe, but you don't have to be a fan of super hero movies to enjoy this movie. it has good pacing and holds your interest throughout. There are plenty of action and the fight scenes, but unlike the previous Marvel movies, this movie focuses on a heist. This, along with the comedy throughout, makes it a breath of fresh air in the Marvel universe. No Marvel movie since has so seamlessly bonded the genre of action and comedy. <br/><br/>The main character, Scott Lange, is not a billionaire or scientist or ancient god, and he doesn't have super strength or intelligence; he is a thief who deals with holding down a job and being able to see his daughter. This makes him incredibly relatable. Being played by Paul Rudd doesn't hurt either. Rudd, along with the rest of the cast, delivers a memorable performance. The idea of a father trying to reconcile his relationship with his daughter may have been used before, but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas make it work without seeming trite or overused. The role that really stands out is Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket. He is, in my opinion, the most terrifying villain the Marvel universe has seen yet. He doesn't want global domination, he wants money and power, and that makes him a very believable villain. Stoll's performance is more three-dimensional than one might expect in a super hero movie, and adds to the already great cast.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive part of Ant-Man was the visual effects. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D, and the quality was stunning. I don't like most movies in 3D, but this one worked well. The shrinking and growing looked very good as well as the action sequences. Although the action happens on a small scale, it can stand up to any of the other movies Marvel has made. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film yet, I would highly recommend it. The acting, directing, and cinematography all make this film highly enjoyable, even if you haven't seen any of Marvel's previous films."
"shawneofthedead","8","143","257","15 July 2015"," It's f-ant-astic.
","For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym – the original Ant-Man in the comic books – to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product – Peyton Reed's Ant-Man – is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.<br/><br/>After serving his jail sentence, Scott Lang (Rudd) just wants to reunite with his daughter Cassie and get his life back on track. But he soon discovers that people in the outside world – including his ex- wife Maggie (Greer) and her new cop boyfriend Paxton (Cannavale) – aren't particularly kind to former convicts. Beaten down by circumstances, he agrees to pull off one last heist with his eternally optimistic buddy Luis (Pena). It's a crime that places him squarely in the path of Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), a retired, semi-reclusive scientist who decides to enlist Scott in his life-long mission of preventing the Pym Particle – a technological breakthrough that allows him to become the super- small, super-strong Ant-Man – from falling into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Ant-Man gets off to a somewhat shaky start. The tale of an honourable rogue who's looking for a shot at redemption is a well-worn storytelling trope, one that the film initially seems to embrace rather too eagerly. As we watch Scott soldier through a host of tiny indignities, the dialogue – still credited to Wright and his co-writer Joe Cornish, with rewrites by Rudd and Adam McKay – is uninspired, and oftentimes uncomfortably on-the-nose. There's no subtlety here, and the sense of fun that accompanies Scott's attempt to hold down a job in Baskin Robbins feels a wee bit forced.<br/><br/>But the film kicks into higher gear, and stays there, once Scott stumbles onto or, more accurately, steals his second chance. His discovery of the Ant-Man suit and all that entails – working with Hank, meeting Hank's aloof but eminently capable daughter Hope (Lilly), training to prevent Hank's former protégé Darren Cross (Stoll) from replicating the Pym Particle for sale to the highest bidder – give the story the shot of adrenaline it needs. In the blink of an eye, this superhero heist flick finds its feet, and transforms into a whirlwind of action, humour and heart. Reed's camera zigs merrily from Luis' unique method of exposition (brilliant) to Scott's attempts to survive Hope's training (bruisingly hilarious), before zagging into the dark, trembling heart of Hank's troubled relationship with his daughter.<br/><br/>Indeed, what makes Ant-Man work so well is its insistence on respecting its characters and taking their concerns and relationships seriously. This provides the film with an emotional anchor amidst all the madcap chaos and gleeful irreverence. Scott's overpowering love for his young daughter runs parallel to Hank's own concern for Hope, and even Paxton – initially caricaturised as the stereotypical brutish new boyfriend – is given layers and depth beyond what might be expected of a film that seems so silly on the surface. This culminates in the film's best action sequence: one that manages to be utterly ridiculous, as the camera cheekily zooms in and out of a conflict that's entirely proportional to the size of its participants; but also deeply heartfelt, when Scott makes a split-second decision between life and probable death. <br/><br/>For anyone concerned about Ant-Man subsisting in its own little bubble within the MCU, rest assured that there's plenty on display here to please even the most die-hard of fans. The film features not only a welcome cameo from a very popular agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but also ties Scott firmly into MCU continuity with a hugely pleasing direct reference to Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between Ant-Man and a certain Avenger proves that this miniscule hero has what it takes to stand proud alongside the world's mightiest champions. (Stay through the credits, by the way, for two incredibly exciting hints at what's to come for the MCU in the future.)<br/><br/>As with all the other films and television shows in Marvel's burgeoning media empire, the cast of Ant-Man is pitch-perfect. Rudd puts his goofy and amiably sexy charisma to excellent use as Scott, allowing us to believe that this one man can be as silly as he is strong, and as serious as he is funny. Lilly gets the big-screen role she richly deserves in Hope, who's acknowledged at every point in the film as being better, stronger, and more capable than the men around her think she is. Douglas plays a far more palatable version of Dr. Pym (who can be tough to swallow in the comics), and does so with his trademark charm and magnetism, while Stoll gives good psychopath as the increasingly unhinged, patently cruel Cross.<br/><br/>Ant-Man may not edge out the other films that make up Phase Two of the MCU in a straw poll – it does, after all, face some pretty serious competition in what has been an unbroken run of truly excellent superhero films. But it's an incredibly solid effort: smart, rich, deep and funny, teeming with ideas, genres and the potential for so much more. Now if that doesn't make for a great superhero movie, what does?"
"ajetunmobimoji","10","320","604","1 July 2015"," Ant Man is astonishing.
","This movie is incredible. A ton of fun with brilliant action and hilarious dialogue this is another fantastic win for Marvel. Paul Rudd plays a likable and charismatic hero who really makes you root for him and his goals. Michael Pena is the real heist of this film as he steals every scene that he is in. Corey Stoll as the villain was a fantastic choice from Marvel. He can play the corporate business man and an intimidating villain. The visuals are stunning in this film. All of the tiny ant scenes are visually outstanding and hilarious. The are two post credit scenes which are fantastic and really tie into the larger universe. Ant Man is a fantastic movie which is worth your money and I suggest that you see it in cinemas."
"prospectus_capricornium","8","152","279","15 July 2015"," Mammoth in its Tiniest Form
","Had it been too desperate and hopeless, ANT-MAN would have shrunk its way for admission to the almost-complete, Avengers team. But neither such concern nor saving the world from an impending catastrophic destruction, holds weight heavy enough to pull this miniature superhero from his top priority: winning back his daughter. The emotional weight of the narrative comes across as an anomalous content to the generally comedic structure of the film, but they serve purpose for the overall flow of the proceedings, nonetheless.<br/><br/>The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has just been released from prison after committing burglary. He has been prohibited to see his daughter due to his inability to provide financial support, no thanks to his being an ex-con that keeps hindering him from getting a job. He meets the highly-intellectual yet solitary scientist, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who has a job for him: pulling off a heist on his ex-protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who is in possession of a size-changing prototype, that poses massive amount of threats to worldwide security. Using a military suit that allows him to shrink back and forth, in size, Lang carries on with the mission with the hope that by doing so, he would be able to reclaim and earn the reputation and respect he lost, especially his daughter's.<br/><br/>It's easier to see Ant-Man as a beautiful mess, rather than a well-crafted superhero flick with profound depth and sense . There's a lot of illogical nonsense that always nearly sends the film to wreckage, but there's also so much of the fun side to make up for the eventual narrative shortcoming. At the center of its comic efforts, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man shines with his general amiability, pulling off his role with credible wit and comic allure. Rudd is such a delight here, and his presence and effortless take on his character make the mostly messed-up flow of the events, extremely palatable. There's also much to say about Michael Douglas, how his character, Pym, easily integrates well with Lang and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lily) , to provide a firm and well-knitted character framework. Corey Stoll, on the other hand, is less impressive, barely providing the needed threat to make his presence felt and his belligerence imminent. But on moments where he and Lang engage in beautifully-choreographed fight scenes, the ineptitude gets relegated below the more important aspects of the proceedings, and once it does, the breathtaking visual schemes work under the spotlight, capturing Lang's size-changing skill with epic elaborateness. There's magic in every size shift, and the visual artistry is at its peak to deliver the moment.<br/><br/>Perhaps, one of the most immediately-noticeable difference of Ant-Man from its Marvel fellows is that it doesn't engage, nor rush too much, to explosive battles that generally results to immeasurable destruction. It is noticeably evident on the fact that its most interesting and most jaw-dropping action setpiece, happens in a toy train set. Most importantly, this new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe places its comic prowess at the center of its general effort to validate its entry to the franchise, and that is achieved without putting the natural action/adventure tendency of its superhero, nor the inevitable emotional nature of its characters, at risk of getting overshadowed by the rudimentary elements of the narrative.<br/><br/>It's actually hard to gauge ANT-MAN using the same measure that made the rest of its pack, mammoth and omnipotently powerful. But in its own right, and sub-atomic scale, this microscopic superhero is clearly a power behemoth, and it will surely spring back to its even bigger form, once the Avenger call is delivered."
"BiiivAL","8","93","169","13 June 2018"," The smallest superhero
","Undoubtedly, each of us in childhood had favorite superheroes that we admired. They were in demand and needed, because they always taught a good cause: they clearly demonstrated how to be persistent and strong; how to overcome difficulties and obstacles; To reach heights and conquer new horizons; be able to love and offer a helping hand in a difficult moment; and most importantly - to remain yourself, soul and heart. Such acts and good deeds invariably evoked feelings of pride and enthusiasm, and it was so attractive and tempting that they could not help imitating them - fluttering like a smoke out of everyday everyday life and moving towards a huge peace, in the name of his own salvation. Sometimes it happens that patriotism prevails over soulfulness, and after all the lofty and ambitious, at times haughty and arrogant projects about superheroes, I want to take a break, to look at something that is not burdensome, unconstrained, perhaps even modest and simpler, closer to my liking. Following the loud and sensational ""Era of the Altron"", the company Marvel, provides just such an opportunity, providing in his universe a place of an Ant-Man, whose name is not so popular and known as other heroes, but nevertheless, it is needed for the purpose of a full set , and also for the completion of the second phase of this very carnival.<br/><br/>The man-ant. In the past, he was Dr. Hank Pym, now - burglar and thief Scott Lang. People do not shout at all, do not shout out his name, they do not sing praises in his honor, but the gifts given by Pim, in particular the reduction in size, clearly stand out Scott on the background of other superheroes, and, of course, find an interesting and fascinating application for themselves. Scott is far from hopeless, like many others, he also has his advantages, in fact skillfully breaks through protective mechanisms. In the same virtuosic way, Marvel draws parallels between the tiny world of the Ant-Man and our ordinary. This is the highlight of the picture, where from a daily routine, such as the running water in the bathroom, the movement of insects, there is a really exciting show that does not get bored, at least because of its novelty and uniqueness. Ants who are a friendly team, attract a lot of attention, manifesting themselves from different sides, and to discover and discover something new and amazing in its own way is always pleasant.
Without opposition and struggle, the whole picture does not lining up, so you need an opponent, who is a pupil of Hank Pym - Darren Kross, nicknamed the Yellow Hornet. And yet, it is worth noting that in the picture of Peyton Reed there are no strictly negative characters, there are only people who have lost their way. As a matter of fact, the Cross is the same, and its motives are clear and common, as well as Lang, Pim and others. If the ""Man-Ant"" and stands out with some ingenuity, then only by that small world, and as to the decoupling of the plot and the characters - they are submitted in the most elementary and uncomplicated manner. Be that as it may, this does not affect the film, which, in addition to its wittyness, wins and due to a good actor's presentation. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, together with their characters perfectly in harmony with each other, do not forget Michael Penny, with his funny character and funny gang, which makes a significant proportion of humor, due to his absurdity and absurdity.<br/><br/>If you reproach the ""Person-ant"", then only for the accelerated rhythm of the narrative, leaving in the end a feeling of unfinishedness and haste. Shortened actions and incompletely developed relationships experience the same sense of conciseness as the ""Altron era"", but in this case, based on the above aspect, Peyton Read's film turns out to be more advantageous, perhaps because of the lack of trickery and sophistication . In addition to the fantastic, interesting and without exaggeration of the exciting world, the theme of love and family drama is touched upon. Love between the parent and the child, family ties are not just superficial, or for the species, they occupy an important place in the picture, which also gives an impression of a small share of its dramatic and soulfulness. ""Person-ant"" can be safely called the most real outlet, against the backdrop of great pathos and excessive heroism. The film is light, casual, pleasant, sometimes ironic and funny. He will certainly find his place among other Marvel projects, thereby expanding his cinematic universe even more."

","I went into this flick not expecting much. I'm not an Ant Man fan so I was not waiting in anticipation for this as much as I wanted to see Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The character that Paul Rudd plays in this movie is not the Ant Man I wanted to see, and Micheal Douglas' role as Hank Pym, the original Ant man only made me want to see him dawn the suit even more, cause Micheal Douglas was everything a superhero should be in this movie, Charming, really good dialog, and ready for action. <br/><br/>Overall, Ant Man surprised me. It was one of the more unique superhero movies out. Ant Man did things far beyond just punching and kicking that a lot of superheroes are doing on the big screen and went places no other super hero could go making for an action packed adventure. As cool as Ant Man was when he was regular size beating up the bad guys, was as good as when he was shrunken, riding and controlling ants in a world only he can go to.<br/><br/>The villain Darren Cross was actually pretty good too. Not as good as Loki, but just as psycho. <br/><br/>Once again, not an Ant Man fan but this movie is changing my mind. I'm so impressed with what Paul Rudd did with the character. <br/><br/>Not only that, but it's a great Marvel comic movie, in how it intertwines with the whole Marvel cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend seeing in 3D cause it's that type of movie that deserves it."

","I think all the people who've written a negative review of this movie because of its apparent ""scientific contradictions"" are missing the point.<br/><br/>How can people who accept a man turning into a green monster or holes opening in the sky and spitting out an army of hover bike-riding space aliens criticise the science in this film? That's probably the worse case of deluded double standards I've ever witnessed.<br/><br/>No, the REAL problem with this movie is just like any other MCU film. The thunderingly dull expository dialogue, the pantomime characters, the cheap cinematography, the flat and stilted performances, the dramatically compromised script and the infantile tone. And the most insulting aspect is that every single one of these cinematic atrocities spends vast amounts of its running time promising us even more of this trash is still to come.<br/><br/>The problem with Disney and Marvel and the relentless machine they've created is that so much money has been made from this dross that actually MAKING A GOOD MOVIE now seems to be nowhere near the top of their agenda. Another $175m gets spent, it opens, pimply faced kids vomit out their cash for a couple of weeks, then it goes to China, makes more, numbers are counted, accountants smile, Disney smiles, rinse and repeat.<br/><br/>But nobody's making a good movie.

"darrenwolf7-962-309415","4","130","269","20 July 2015"," Unable to adhere to their own rules.
","I am abysmally disappointed in the execution of this film. This film, like it's peers, has all the Hallmarks of a produced-for-the masses, generic, and stereotypical film created for the lowest common denominator. There is no innovation in this film, only mind-numbing clichés that fill the monotonous hours otherwise spent counting the number of in-world errors the films directors manage to commit. <br/><br/>As a cinephile and a resolute fan of super-hero movies and action flicks alike I can forgive a meaningless plot focused once again on a dysfunctional family unit where a well-meaning male protagonist finds himself at odds with a morally bankrupt society, a teary-eyed ""I only want the best for our daughter"" token mother, and a cliché domineering ""replacement father"" with a skewed perspective of our hero's motivations. The daughter managed to swim a little higher than the bottom of the barrel but only just enough to reach the ""I'm a smart sassy kid with more self-awareness than the adults think and I'll express that with a few endearing one liners"" level. <br/><br/>I can forgive the generic antagonist meglomaniac who used to ""hold so much promise"" until he effectively ""turns to the dark side"" using his abilities for evil and/or personal gain and in a way designed to convey as much sensitive information about his intentions to his enemies as possible thereby giving them ample opportunity to thwart his every plan. I can look past the incredibly cliché nameless ""investors"" representing the greed and hunger of a capitalistic world for domination as this amazing, new, and world changing technology is sold to the highest bidder despite the fact that this approach is a clear step below the ability of an motivated antagonist who intends to put their potential to personal use. (Predictably, despite the best efforts of our hero's, our antagonist still finds an opportune time to don his suit to give us our much anticipated climatic battle scene.)<br/><br/>I can even forgive the stereotypical ""wizened"" scientist with emotional baggage who can never allow his creation to fall into the wrong hands, a son/daughter with resentment and abandonment issues, and, surprise, the mysterious death of their spouse illogically requiring them to lie about the details to ""protect"" their loved ones until the right ""time.""<br/><br/>But, in addition to every stereotype, cliché, and generic element of this movie, I am incredibly annoyed at also being expected to lower my intellect to the point where it is assumed I will pay no attention to anything but the most shallow details of a movie so that if/when the producers violate their own in-universe laws I won't care or notice. <br/><br/>Specifically, the suit functions simply by reducing or increasing the distance between atoms of an object. This in turns makes an object more or less dense without altering it's total mass, hence the multiple characterizations of Antman as still weighing and having the strength of a 200 pound man, being able to kill with a single punch, being much faster, stronger, etc. Apparently these details only matter when it's convenient for the producers. As many have already stated, how in the Hell does Antman ride an ant when he is effectively a 200lb man in compact form? If I reduced the earth to the size of a marble I can tie it to my dog but he still won't be dragging it around anytime soon. How is he able to stand on the shoulders of his friends? When he runs he should be exponentially faster, when he struggles to lift things (toy blocks) they should be several times heavier than an object that can be lifted by a 200 pound man or go zinging away like a bullet. The whole purpose of the suit is to reduce the spread of force over a relative area thereby increasing it's overall impact and strength. Think of the Human body like a cannon and the ant suit like a focused laser. Time and time and time again within the movie these in world laws of physics are ignored or turned on and off at whim to suit the needs of a given scene. The enlarged train should have still weighed no more than a toy train, the enlarged ant no more than a normal ant, and the damn tank on the scientists keychain should have been nigh immovable. How in the world is Antman denser upon shrinking and yet a tank appears to weigh about as much as a couple pencils. <br/><br/>Obviously this is a movie. Clearly it isn't meant to simulate the laws of our own universe. However, it's hard to sit back and imagine that either the director and producers are so stupid and profit driven they are unable to take the time to produce something that even appears to try and conform to the rules and expectations given to the audience, or apparently I, as an audience member, am considered so intellectually challenged that I'm expected to focus on the bright lights, cool sounds, and pretty pretty colors at the expense of any clear story-line at all beyond the cliché ""oohs"" and ""aahhs"" we all get when our own personal stories and imaginations are confirmed through the lives of these on screen characters.<br/><br/>I will say, I thoroughly enjoyed the film style associated with the token comedic relief characters monologue scenes. They were beautifully executed and I could probably watch hours of them."

","Once upon a time, Ant-Man was the Marvel movie to beat. A founding Avenger with less baggage of expectation, Ant-Man allowed the studio increasing danger of collapsing under the titanic weight of their own 'universe-building' a chance to shake things up with something small (ha), intimate, and quirky. Paired with the eclectic stylistic flair and consummate comedic timing of visionary writer/director Edgar Wright, Ant-Man was primed to become the breath of fresh air in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br/><br/>Alas. <br/><br/>Wright's departure from the project, followed by shady, last minute rewrites, and the hiring of Peyton Reed, best known for helming despicably generic attempts at comedy, didn't bode well. But Marvel's impeccable track record and the inspired casting of Paul Rudd suggested there was still Hope (ha) an enjoyable romp could be salvaged out of the film's prior potential. Indeed, it's hard not to sneer that the film's theme of ""second chances,"" uttered roughly 1800 times by Michael Douglas with all the subtlety of a children's bedtime story, reads as a meta plea for clemency on behalf of the studio. And yet, even with this growing backlog of worrisome evidence against it, none could have predicted the final product to come. <br/><br/>Ant-Man is, not to mince words, an insultingly poor film. <br/><br/>Inexcusably lazy, under-thought, clichéd, soulless the list of adjectives is endless. Purportedly structured around a heist narrative, the miserable excuse for a script slaps together a slew of loathsome narrative crutches (released con coaxed into ""one last job"", disgraced dad trying to win back custody rights to his daughter, emotionally distant genius forced to confront the demons of his pastyawn), glued together with laughably contrived MCU tie-ins (a dire prologue tacked on to remind audiences that Marvel's Agent Carter still exists, an Avengers cameo so embarrassingly out of place I won't dare spoil it here, ugh) in a shamefully textbook example of 'safe studio filmmaking'. <br/><br/>One would imagine that after the rampant success of the eccentric, daring Guardians of the Galaxy Marvel would push the envelope even further into the realm of clever humour and weird levity. Instead, Reed inexplicably stoops to sassy 'comedic relief' side characters that would have felt stale in the 1980s, otherwise leaning on Paul Rudd's indestructibly affable charisma to keep the film afloat. And though Rudd is nearly impossible to dislike, turning on the charm and puppy-dog pathos and mining the abysmal script for laughs like never before, even he can only do so much to save a sinking ship (it's ironic Rudd's Lang makes a Titanic reference). Running less than two hours and still feeling offensively overlong, Ant-Man plods along at an insomnia-curing pace (Reed may as well have re-titled the film Slug-Man), counterbalancing a stupefying long training montage with terse monologues about morality so repetitive there is a legitimate worry of having entered the simulacrum of Groundhog Day. <br/><br/>The sole consolation: the film's visual effects, while often looking slapdash and rushed, do conjure an ant-sized handful of fascinating imagery. Lang's first shrinking experience into the suddenly desolate wasteland of a bathtub provides a blip of entertainment, and there is brief joy – nay, perhaps even a chuckle or two – to be found in his ant-training escapades (watching him surf through a drainpipe on a skittering carpet of ants is a highlight). Similarly, Lang's accidental descent into the subatomic realm provides a gorgeous feast of Escher- influenced surrealism. But, before you know it, we're back to being pummelled senseless by cliché once again. Sigh.<br/><br/>Speaking of pummelling: despite a surprisingly sound rationalization of the physicality of Ant- Man (small yet compact, ""like a bullet""), the film's action sequences are tragically sparse. It's a shame, as the unique size-changing fight choreography offers a few precious where the film momentarily sputters with some life and vigour. Surely a couple of minutes of Michael Douglas' droning could have been shaved off for a few more shots of unorthodox pounding? Ah, but that would require a director with even a skeletal grasp of energy, pace, or vision (ahem). Among the film's immeasurable log of missed opportunities: no Lang entering the human body and attacking from within, and not even a fleeting glimpse of a triumphant Giant-Man transformation (at least one climactic moment provides an ideal setup). And the Wasp? Shamefully, unforgivably absent. All the while, Christophe Beck's musical score bwomps away in the background, the most hackneyed pastiche of heroic musical clichés yet, and there are even a couple of moments where Reed has the gall to attempt to mimic Edgar Wright's trademark kinetic 'swish-pan' editing and cinematography. Rub salt in the gaping wound, why dontcha. The squandered potential on screen is almost too much to bear. <br/><br/>Even the film's generally talented cast is Hopeless (see what I did there? I used the same joke twice. Just like Ant-Man) at providing any respite from the turgid mess surrounding them. Apart from Rudd – and even he starts to seem tired by the end – Michael Douglas snores through the film, his Hank Pym an unmistakably extraneous mentor archetype, while Evangeline Lily continues her Hobbit streak of astoundingly flat 'token action woman' cardboard cutouts. Corey Stoll, saddled with the worst lines the script has to offer (which is saying something), is so embarrassingly cartoonish here it almost overrides his previously impressive work in House of Cards, while poor Michael Peña is forced to constantly mug for increasingly cheap laughs as Lang's fellow ex-con buddy. The worst of the lot: Bobby Canavale's oafish cop/stepdad rival is hilariously out of place, while Judy Greer is given so little screen time as Lang's estranged wife she may as well have played the Invisible Woman. <br/><br/>In conclusion (just to finish beating that dead horse): Edgar Wright once opined that ""the only bad films are dull films."" Ladies and gentlemen, Ant-Man is a bad film. <br/><br/>-3/10"

","Through this masterpiece, on par with, in my humble opinion, all other Marvel movies currently out in the Avengers Saga, obviously including the side series, Marvel has completely blown me away. <br/><br/>Character development, solid plot, fantastic humour and amazing cast all done flawlessly and did not leave me hoping for more, but rather asking 'When's the sequel coming out?'<br/><br/>With Michael Douglas and Michael Peña, having seen them both in previous movies where their performances are exemplary to say the least, I expect such mastery, but with Paul Rudd, and all the other actors, given this is the first movie in which I ever saw them, I had no idea what to expect. Complete success!<br/><br/>The fighting style of Ant-man is was as I expected since I have some background knowledge of the character, and yet I nonetheless could not have dreamt for such a good combination of just-enough special effects and fantastic actor performances! Ant-man is already brilliantly made, and it only gets more so during the combat scenes, for the ability to shrink and grow at will is something with which, to my great delight, Marvel got very creative, not holding back.<br/><br/>I'm trying to figure out when I can watch it again."
"misterembryo","10","54","110","19 July 2015"," Ant-icipation is over. I Love You, Ant-Man.
","Ant-Man must have been a challenge for these filmmakers. The preceding films from the Avengers Universe featured an epic roster of out-of-this-world heroes whose names alone make you tinkle a little: IRON MAN, THOR, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and then there's Ant-Man. (Womp-womp) While die-hard fans of the comics would recognize Ant-Man as an original member of the ensemble, the general audience may be left to wonder WTF?!<br/><br/>Ant-Man, do you even lift, Bro?<br/><br/>The filmmakers must have been aware of this, considering the tongue-in-cheek treatment of the script. With a screenplay largely penned by Shaun of the Dead legend Edgar Wright, and built upon by other great comedic writers, Joe Cornish (Attack the Bock), Adam McKay (Anchorman), and Ant-Man himself Paul Rudd, Ant-Man does indeed do some heavy lifting, delivering one of the funniest, most entertaining, and visually satisfying superhero movies to date.<br/><br/>The ant super-suit is sick. Red and silver with bulging insectoid eyes, it looks like a modern day motocross version of the Japanese monster slayer Ultraman. As soon as he hits the shrink button, you are sucked into a world so awesome you have no choice but to brace yourself and see where the ride takes you. Stan Lee wanted to make this movie in the 80's but ironically Disney, the production company behind today's Ant-Man, already had a shrinking movie of its own in the works. While ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" was amazing in its time, I couldn't be happier that they waited for the movie effects of today to let Ant- Man zip this way and that, from our world to the minuscule one and back. Coincidentally an ant saved the kids from a giant scorpion in that Rick Moranis classic, and in Ant-Man the ants also play a major role in saving the day. That's right. His power is not only to shrink to the size of an ant, but also to control an army of them. In that respect, this movie is unlike any superhero movie you've ever seen.<br/><br/>The Pym Particle, created by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has the ability to shrink a living human being. Think of the possibilities! Microsurgery, mobility, and of course, warfare! The latter makes Dr. Pym realize just how dangerous this technology really is and he decides to cease research and development altogether. Years pass, and the existence of this technology is reduced to a myth. What Dr. Pym didn't know is that his own assistant Darren Cross (Corey Stoll, House of Cards) had been obsessing over this myth and has been trying to replicate this technology on his own. Stoll has a unique ability to make you sympathize for his character at times, but can also be straight up scary.<br/><br/>Dr. Pym and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly, Lost) know they have to stop Cross but keep butting heads. Hope is a badass, but Pym refuses to let her get involved, which reveals some deeper, more serious daddy issues. Their only hope is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, my man crush), an ex-convict who was a professional burglar, not a robber because Lang insists that implies physical violence, and he's not about that life. To pull off the job, Lang enlists his original heist crew, played by David Dastmalchian, Rapper T.I., and Michael Peña, who offers some of the most hilarious scenes in the movie. What ensues is an adventure, a comedy, an action movie and a heist rolled into one Little Debbie oatmeal cookie crumb of elephantine excitement and pure elation. If you haven't noticed, I like this movie.<br/><br/>Close friends may say I am biased because it stars Paul Rudd, whom I have been enamored with ever since Clueless. When Cher realized she was in love with Josh, I too realized Paul Rudd is my number one man crush. Let me close this by taking a moment to acknowledge how perfect Paul Rudd is in the role of Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He is a master at self-deprecating humor, as seen in movies like ""I Love You, Man"" and ""Knocked Up"" and his role as Mike Hannigan on ""Friends."" This is a necessity when you see how Ant-Man may have somewhat of a Napoleon Complex when he inevitably has to measure up against the mighty Avengers. Paul Rudd has shown his chops as a dramatic actor in movies like ""The Shape of Things"" and ""Admission,"" and again here in Ant- Man as an estranged father, who wants nothing more than to spend more time with his daughter Cassie. While elements of his various roles can be seen in Ant-Man this was nothing like anything Paul Rudd has ever done before, and he pulled it off.<br/><br/>His dedication can be seen not only in the moment that reveals his handsomely chiseled abs. In preparation for the role, Paul Rudd bought an ant farm to study. Even after he finished shooting, he decided to keep it. Just when you thought you couldn't fall in love with Paul Rudd any further. On the week the movie was released, Paul Rudd earned a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and deservedly so. Somehow it's not the star that immortalizes him in film history. It's his stellar performance in Ant-Man, the movie that will shrink and find its way into your heart and stay there forever."

I felt is was a waist of an opportunity.<br/><br/>Way too much time was spent on explaining ""Ant-Man"" and no enough time was spent on action. And as for the Science well while it might be possible to shrink someone by reducing the space between their molecules. If you make anything larger it would tend to have the effect of turning a solid into a gas. (Wait to the near the end of the movie see what I mean).<br/><br/>The Ant man suite itself turns out to be a very flexible thing it can either be warn by Michael Dogulas aka Dr Hank Pym or Paul Rudd, Scott Lang or his Daughter Evangeline Lilly yes one size Ant-Man suite really does fit all? I only wish my clothing was as flexible as this suite.<br/><br/>I could go on but I will stop there. I would suggest go see it for yourself see what you think but only once Terminator is no longer on in your cinema and if you do not have any children with you that might get easily bored. All if you do decided to go see it do not leave until the very last of the credits have finished or you could quite possibly miss the best thing about this movie.

","Its a shame so much money was spent on so little. I'm not talking about the premise of the movie, a microscopic super hero. No I'm talking about the dismal film, Ant Man, represents. <br/><br/>This film, in spite of its budget and reasonable cast, feels a hell of a lot like a badly made B-Grade flick. The kind that goes straight to television. The acting is hammy and melodramatic, the storyline tedious and formulaic and the action badly timed and somehow, rather awkward and clumsy. <br/><br/>In fairness, this is not easy subject matter to migrate from comic book to big screen. The notion of a super hero who can shrink in size is a tough one requiring very careful handling and timing. The fact the subject matter is tossed around like a football is the reason its such a mess. <br/><br/>My advice, give this one a miss. Two out of ten from me."
"billygoat1071","8","29","57","16 July 2015"," Bursting with Personality
","Ant-Man has been through a very long development, it was started with Edgar Wright committing to write and direct the film, but years went by and Marvel finally has a studio of its own, manipulations do compromise Wright's vision which lead him leaving the project. In spite of that issue, the film spares much of his screenplay as it still has his trademarks all over the place. While it's delightful to notice those sequences being left intact, there is still a dejected feeling of what it could have been if he actually handled it entirely. For now, most of the style is basic Marvel. As a movie itself, it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't contain much heavy handed explosions compared to the last few films they gave us. And it's a good reminder that joy can still be found in this genre even at its smaller scale, thanks to its engaging cast and downright appealing personality.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't involve stopping some mass destruction or a general build up for future installments (the reference still exists, but isn't exactly the priority.) People may brag about this as going back to the basic mold of origin stories where you see outcasts living in a city having unexpected fate of becoming a superhero. The difference however is the premise is a lot sillier that is taken with vast self-awareness through that concept. The entirety is basically a mix between family drama and smart comedy. The comedic side is where it thoroughly shines, the film finding energy through its visuals and each actor's charisma. The drama on the other hand is basically to establish the character's pathos through their backstories. It's not quite subtle, but fits enough to breathe after a set of sillier spectacles.<br/><br/>The major plot is basically just a heist, except the main character has the ability to alter his own scale while spectators and their enemies are constantly being flummoxed about what exactly is happening. It's simple, but there is so much going on and yet it is made easily exciting by its own personality and crazier imaginations, you can identify that most of the creativity came from Wright's idea. How the movie recreates his style from the script is fine and it's admirable to retain the same quirk and energy from the vision at some points. At the other scenes, it's typical Marvel flare, and as said, it looks cool, but it's more remarkable at the less conventional turns.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd brings real charisma and some depth to Scott Lang, keeping him from being a generic anti-hero. Michael Douglas establishes actual depth within Hank Pym in a lot of moments. Corey Stoll embraces his almost unbelievably inhumane role, which strangely makes it an effectively menacing villain. Evangeline Lilly appears to be more than a love interest and that is alright. Michael Peña steals all of his scenes, which a role that could have been just another comic-relief, he makes all of his character's greatest comedic moments remarkably delightful.<br/><br/>It's still quite inevitable to keep bringing up the supposed-to-be helmer of Ant-Man, because his fingerprints are really there, while it's actually nice to see it hinting every once in a while, it also feels somewhat exasperating for what daring opportunity it could have been. We'll never know the answer. Still, Ant-Man brings a sheer amount of fun. It's filled with comicbook enthusiasm and memorable laughs that appropriately sticks through its actually preposterous property. The cast helps bringing all of it to life, from levity to gravity. The action is executed with affecting weirdness. Ant-Man is best when it's weirder, because that is where it speaks its own flavor."

"jmcd2007","2","60","131","2 August 2015"," Way too much forced comedy and not enough action or fight scenes
","This film was just plain terrible. This was actually the first film that I saw that had Paul Rudd in it. Besides that fact, being that I've enjoyed most other Marvel films, I decided to give Ant-Man a try. This, film, however, was simply not good. Once the film was finished, I actually walked out of the theater somewhat happy knowing that I used a free ticket that I got through my theater's rewards program to go see it. Otherwise, I would've regretted even spending money on it. As a superhero, Ant-Man seems to be one of the weakest links in the Marvel superhero chain, as his only special ability is to shrink to the size of an ant while confusing his enemies of his presence at the same time. Not much of a superpower, if you ask me.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with this film was that there was WAY too much forced comedy in it. Michael Pena had to be the most annoying person in this film, with his constant carrying on about almost everything, aiming to be funny when in reality, it's just annoying. Quite a few of Paul Rudd's jokes in the film seemed to fall flat, too. The story plot seemed incredibly slow, too, aiming to focus on more of the main character's relationship with his ex-wife and family than anything else. Just when things couldn't get any worse, the biggest head scratcher in the film seemed to be an unnecessary cameo from Falcon, who seemed terribly out of place. The fight with Yellowjacket was lame, too, as it didn't even seem to last that long. <br/><br/>One thing I will mention, though, is how well they managed to make Michael Douglas look about 30 years younger in the beginning of the film. So whoever was in charge there, well done! Moreover, perhaps the funniest part of the film is when an ant is super-sized and was seen walking out of Lang's house. Not only that, but when Lang's daughter Cassie had her toy train (Thomas the Tank Engine) super-sized and then came crashing out of the house onto a police car...that in itself was also moderately amusing. Aside from that, this film wasn't anything to ride home about, and I can only hope that Marvel realizes that by not making a sequel to this...EVER. I'll take The Avengers and Captain America film series over this film any day."

Paul Rudd and his group of friends were the only thing that made this movie bearable. This just proves that Marvel can create a steaming pile of sh*t and people will still love it. Just as lil wayne can rap about defecating on a toilet and make millions. My poor expectations from the trailer were met."
"michaelsharples96","9","35","73","8 July 2015"," A refreshing and incredible addition to the MCU
","Marvel returns to top form after the extremely underwhelming and disappointing 'Avenger's: Age of Ultron' to give us 'Ant-Man'. It is the 12th film in the long running cinematic franchise. A refreshing look at a whole set of new character and a whole new adventure to accompany them. <br/><br/>This for me is without a doubt one of the best MCU films, if not marvel films in general, to come out in recent years. With an intelligently written, charming and HILARIOUS script. WITHOUT a doubt Marvel's funniest movie to date. The dialogue in this movie has Edgar Wright written all over it. There's not a joke that doesn't hit at least one member of the audience. Lines that nobody laughed at I understood the references and found them to be hilarious. It definitely has a style of humour that will cater to all kinds of people. But it isn't a comedy, it's just unbelievably funny, at heart it's a heist film. And a damn good one at that <br/><br/>It never diverted off track as many blockbusters in recent years have done. It was a well told plot, it never really felt convoluted or messy. When one arc was being told it stuck to that one arc and it was clear cut and you always knew what was happening on screen when it was happening. As I've stated in my previous paragraph it's obvious to any one that this was in some parts written and influenced by Edgar Wright. <br/><br/>Some of the coolest and likable characters in the whole of the MCU appear in this movie. Every word that came out of Michael Peña's mouth had me in stitches, he was one of the many highlights of the movie. One of which being Paul Rudd as the titular character. With such charisma and character he graces the screen and the majority of the scenes he's in, well, any scene without Peña that is. Having such a likable person play a very down on his luck guy who's just trying to turn his life around and be a better father to his daughter really adds to the sympathy you feel for the character. And makes you want him to succeed. <br/><br/>I liked how they stuck to the mythos of Scott Lang, having him be a thief and a crook, having him steal the suit from Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) was straight out of the comics. Unlike with Tony creating Ultron instead of Pym. It's definitely one of the most 'close to the source material' marvel films to be released which is something admirable in itself. All the little details like having the daughter of Hank, Hope, added into the mix. The story of how Janet died wasn't exactly accurate but it worked perfectly with the story. It seemed like a good way of going about it, it added emotion and depth to the characters to make you care for them more. To which the critics say there was no emotional weight, but when you have likable characters in a movie played by likable people and a well written script to go along, you definitely start to feel sympathy for them in a way that it doesn't feel shoehorned in. Unlike again, the Black Widow and Bruce Banner love interest or the death of a certain character. It isn't forced in there out of the blue to make you care how they end up. You care because of how well they're written. You may feel like in nitpicking and bashing Age of Ultron but I'm not, these little detours have a reason. That reason is the right and wrong way to do it. And this was definitely the right way. <br/><br/>The villain: He wasn't top tear MCU villain like, in my opinion Loki and, who else? Nope just him. He wasn't in it a huge deal. He wasn't really fleshed out, but I could see from the trailers that he wasn't really going to be. He showed emotion and reasoning that could seem justifiable to some. But he never had a just cause, the story of why he was doing what he was doing wasn't really explained. He just seemed angry at Hank for tossing him aside. It felt in a way like a good old fashion revenge story but with a slightly different agenda more than it did anything else. He could have been a little more developed, but it's marvel, what can you do? He was menacing and Corey Stoll portrayed him quite well considering what he was given. <br/><br/>I think another thing I liked about this movie was it's use of CGI and special effects. It wasn't overbearing like in *Cough* Age of Ultron *cough*, sorry. It was well used, it was easy on the eyes and not shoved right in your face like he whom shall not be named. It was just the right amount. The action scenes are great, there's levels of threat that you feel. You feel kind of suspenseful, not much but it's definitely there. The parts where the main characters were in peril weren't as life threatening as they maybe could have been. But these are minor if not unnoticeable discrepancies.<br/><br/>All in all 'Ant-Man' is a SUPER FUN MOVIE, I had a ball with this film. I was in hysterics as the humour hit a good 90% of the time. Action is realistic and believable and the villain while not very fleshed out was threatening on screen. This movie is, as Jeremy Jahns would put it. <br/><br/>AWESOMETACULAR!!"

","Ant Man is about a likable burglar, played by Paul Rudd, who finds a suit which allows him to shrink down to the size of the ant. The owner of the suit, and previous Ant Man (Michael Douglas) trains the main character to use the suit in order to stop the villain, who is attempting to militarize a shrinking suit of his own. The cast is solid and has good chemistry, and the movie is pleasantly humorous. The action, though there is not a lot of it, is exciting. It includes great special effects, largely in sequences when the hero shrinks and controls ants to aid him. On the other hand the story is for the most part underwhelming, though it does benefit from having a smaller scale than most superhero movies. The villain of the movie, played by Corey Stoll, is wasted, lacking interesting personal motivation or interaction with the main character until the ending."

","From the start I had a feeling this wasn't going to be good. With the other Marvel movies, even if they weren't good films, the trailer at least made it seem fun. But with the Ant-Man trailer I saw nothing to pique my interest. The good reviews gave me hope that the movie was good after all but I should have trusted my gut instead.<br/><br/>Now, as I look back on Ant-Man, the only thing that comes to mind is the boredom I experienced sitting in that theatre. The story has no stakes. They must steal the Yellowjacket suit and destroy Cross's work or else... what? Vague threats about how ""things will be bad"" are not at all exciting so I didn't really care about the plot.<br/><br/>More time is spent on drama between Hope and her father when focus should have been on the main character. And speaking of Hope. Previously I would have said that the romance between Thor and Jane is the worst of the Marvel romances (though I haven't seen the second film) but this just takes the cake. It is not established at all through out the film and the kiss at the end just comes out of nowhere.<br/><br/>And to think - last year we got Captain America 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy. This year it's Avengers 2 and Ant-Man. So much disappointment."

","This reviewer wants to be like Paul Rudd when he turns 46. He first saw the New Jerseyborn actor on the popular sitcom Friends as Phoebe's love interest Mike Hannigan, and loved how he carried off the character with a slacker charm. He then went on to takes on roles in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005) and Knocked Up (2007). Although he played supporting characters in this comedies, there's always that special something which made viewers pay attention.<br/><br/>And now, Rudd is Ant-Man! Yes, a Marvel superhero! If you are like this reader, who isn't a walking encyclopaedia of Marvel history, you probably haven't heard of Ant-Man. Who can take a superhero with a name like that seriously? Not us. Are you sure you need Ant-Man when you've already got Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye from The Avengers?<br/><br/>One thing we are setting straight here – we enjoyed Ant-Man more than the recent The Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The Peyton Reed directed movie, which is also the 12th installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (who's keeping count, really?), sees protagonist Scott Lang (Rudd) help Dr Hank Pym (the always reliable Michael Douglas) safeguard the mystery of a technology which allows users to decrease in size but increase in strength. In the movie, you will hear some scientifically complicated terms, but there isn't really much to know. You just need to be aware of the fact that there is a need to stop a heist that will destroy Earth,<br/><br/>The threat comes in the form of Yellojacket, a thwarted version of the technology helmed by Darren Cross, and coming along for the ride is Dr Pym's daughter Hope van Dyne, and a motley crew of former thieves who will aid Lang save the world.<br/><br/>The 117 minute movie is a very refreshing change from the slew of superhero movies we've been seeing. No overwrought emotions, no excessive self righteousness and no overbearingly dark tones. What you get instead, is a very likable protagonist (thanks to Rudd's appeal, of course) who is an everyman you want to root for. The result is a superhero movie that makes you sit up and watch, laugh and enjoy till the very last minute.<br/><br/>Because it is backed up by a major studio, you can still expect the usual special effects, big explosions and well choreographed action sequences. These are enough to keep fans of Hollywoodblockbusters happy, and to have them feeling that the movie is well worth the price of the ticket.<br/><br/>Credit goes to a wonderful ensemble cast, which includes Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit series, TV's Lost) as the serious but well intending daughter, Corey Stoll (Dark Places, TV's House of Cards) as the villainous disciple and Bobby Cannavale (Blue Jasmine, Chef) as a stepfather to Lang's daughter, as well as Michael Pena (End of Watch, American Hustle), rapper Tip ""T I"" Harris and David Dastmalchian (The Glass Menagerie, Buried Child) as Lang's amusing but resourceful friends.<br/><br/>In this day and age where everyone takes everything too seriously, this is one superhero movie that you'll fine immensely entertaining and enjoyable, without compromising on storytelling and action. Oh, you should also stick around to watch not one, but two end credit scenes which will eventually take the Internet by storm."

I went into this expecting to love it, and I did enjoy it, but for the first time in a MCU movie, the plot holes were just too glaring to over-look, and the script felt disjointed.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie, and I learned long ago, that if I'm going to enjoy a super-hero movie, I can't over-think things. I really have to suspend my dis-belief. I watched this with that same mentality, but I couldn't help feeling like things weren't right.<br/><br/>This movie goes to some great lengths to explain the sci ency parts of what's going on but then completely ignores the things it just told you. Like Scott is told that his mass stays the same when he shrinks... then how can a group of ants or a flying any carry a 200 pound man? How man Hank carry around a key chain of a shrunken tank that would weigh thousands of pounds?<br/><br/>Another thing that kept bothering me... if he can easily make ants and random objects enlarge in size, how come he only shrinks? Why does he never get bigger, or at least mention the possibility? It would seem like that would be just as useful as shrinking. Not mention the fact that ants could no way survive being that size, they would not get enough oxygen. Any when Ant-man is small his voice should get very high in pitch but it stays the same.<br/><br/>Another thing that made no sense, when Hanks wife or Scott shrink down to ""sub- atomic size"" how exactly does this stop a missile or destroy the Wasp suit, if they are really THAT small and shrinking rapidly, it's hard to see how they could do that much damage at that size. Any if he is smaller than molecules, he would not be able to breath because the oxygen molecules would be bigger than him.<br/><br/>Then there was the whole mission that led to the fight with Falcon for some random ""tech"" object, even though it was never explained what that was, or why it was necessary or why Hank couldn't just build a new one.<br/><br/>And then there was the strange was in which Hank recruited Scott, by planting the idea of the safe, but having a friend of a friend tell the story... What if Scoff didn't steal the suit? Why would he bother to take it anyway? There were surely a lot easier ways to recruit him, like just talking to him or offering him money. The money he gave to the girl for telling the story would have been more than enough to convince him to try it on.<br/><br/>They there was the question of why Scott never even questioned this whole issue of the suit ""taking a tole on people"" ""messing with their brain chemistry"" .. you would think he might be slightly worried about that... but no, not at all.<br/><br/>I could go on and on... even with trying to just sit back and enjoy without thinking, these questions kept popping out at me. The movie just really made no sense at all.<br/><br/>I will say that I still enjoyed it. I though Michael Pena did a great job as comic relief, and Paul Rudd was a good Ant-Man, but while I enjoyed this movie, I left feeling sure that it should have been better. It just doesn't quite live up to some of the better MCU movies like Winder Soldier, Avengers, or Iron Man 1."
"p-jonsson","8","13","24","9 December 2015"," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I have to say that I did not have great hopes for this movie. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. As can be expected from a Marvel super hero movie it is not the most intelligent plot around but instead rather heavy on special effects.<br/><br/>Having said that the plot is not bad given the context. I have never read any of the Ant-Man comics so I had no idea what to expect. The little expectation I had was of some guy turning into some ant like creature smashing things left right and center. So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when I found out that the guy was actually shrinking himself to ant size. Actually I went a bit ""what the f"" when I first realized this and felt that this was going to be boring.<br/><br/>However, in the end, I felt it worked out quite well. If it would have just been about some guy shrinking himself then it would indeed have been somewhat boring but the added coolness of this guy being able to command armies of bad-ass ants really helped stave of the boredom.<br/><br/>As I wrote above it is a Marvel super hero movie so it is heavy on special effects and, personally, I felt they where quite okay. There is of course quite a bit of action in the movie as well as a bit of humour. I quite liked the parts where the Ant-Man and his nemesis slugged it out in a children's room and a giant size Thomas the Tank Engine was thrown through the roof and into the garden. Maybe I liked it because Thomas the Tank Engine is a TV show that my kids liked to watch when they were smaller. There where of course a few of the usual Hollywood silly, brain-dead stunts like the tank scene. It could have been so cool but it was really ruined by the total lack of intelligence in the stunt following the cool revelation.<br/><br/>I really liked Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym as well as Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne. I was not too impressed by Paul Rudd but on the while I guess he was not too bad. It is a bit of a shame though that when Hollywood feels they need to throw in a bit of family drama they always have to throw in a divorce. It is rather depressing for us that have lived through such a tragedy after all.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Far better than quite a few of the super hero movies that Marvel/Hollywood have produced like for instance the abysmal Spiderman movies although that is of course a personal opinion."
"Movieandtvlover","9","15","29","7 September 2015"," Marvel is the bomb, not a literal bomb of course....
","I gladly got to see Ant- man on the Thursady night premiere on July 16th, and I got to say Marvel you are literally the bomb. A lot of people were skeptical about this film, but I wasn't one of them, I'm a huge Marvel fan and I own all their movies and watch all their shows , and they haven't let me down once, so why would I have reason to believe they would make a bad film? That's right I didn't. This movie was filled with the most original action scenes, and the humor was hilarious throughout. The script was well written, and that lead to pretty good pacing. The performances from Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Pena, and of course Corey Stoll were excellent, and the rest of the actors did great. The story was good, the direction was good, the costume designs are great as well. The villain is one of the best Marvel has done, even though Ultron was top notch as a villain. Corey Stoll was intimidating and downright psycho, he even was horrible enough to kill a sheep and hold a little girl hostage. I hope we get a sequel real fast, and I think we will, Marvel will be stupid not too. I think Civil War will generate enough buzz for a Ant-man sequel to make money. I'm really looking forward to Marvels next installments, because I love Marvel. I highly recommend this funny, Heist movie, with great original action scenes, and great performances. Please go see this movie."
"thomastobutt","8","2","2","27 November 2019"," EXTREMELY UNDERRATED FILM!
","As said in the title, this film is extremely underrated in my opinion, it may have to do with the smaller stakes amongst such big films in the MCU. Paul Rudd was made for this role (unless the role was quite literally made for him) and he has great chemistry with the actors around him. This films great comic relief through character such as Luis or through the increase/decrease of objects like the 'Thomas the Tank Engine' train set fight scene at the end.<br/><br/>The film is very refreshing and entertaining, definitely worth the watch. Also there's a cool cameo from the Falcon which just reminds you that is part of the MCU."
"Jesse-Hirsbrunner","7","2","2","20 July 2019"," Good entertainment
","I did not expect a masterpiece, i should not get one. I expected an entertaining action movie and that was what i got.<br/><br/>The story is nothing special, there are no surprises. It is a marvel movie. However i did not care about this because the movie is very entertaining with good jokes and nice side charcters. I did enjoy the movie all the time and it feels more like 90 minutes than 2 hours. It really felt like other Edgar Wright movie, and as a big fan of Wright, that is a positive thing for me.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is sometimes amazing (the sub-atomic room), most times good, but sometimes really ugly. I hate the clean Marvel look and here this is always the case. Sometimes the animations look good, but sometimes it is very ugly and too much.<br/><br/>I can however not give this movie 8/10 because i hated the antagonist. Not because of his character and how evil he is, but because he is so boring and there is nothing interesting about him."
"masonsaul","9","2","2","18 July 2019"," Extremely fun origin story
","Ant-Man is an extremely fun origin story and great addition to the MCU. Paul Rudd is great in the lead role with Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña giving great supporting performances. The cg is great and the action sequences are extremely impressive. The humour works really well and it's consistently funny. Unfortunately, it does suffer from the weak villain problem that some other Marvel movies suffer from."
"knoxfan2008","3","43","100","16 July 2015"," It happened...
","I just saw Ant-man, and my review is this. <br/><br/>It was a film I guess. <br/><br/>I mean, if you've seen a Marvel film before, you've seen this film. If you've seen a film in general before, you've seen this film. <br/><br/>The attempts at humour were cringe-worthy, the villain was comically one-dimensional and the acting was so cartoonish I felt bad for the good actors who had to do this film. <br/><br/>The redeeming quality is the great action scenes. they really took advantage of the action scenes and delivered some fun times. But whenever action is not happening, the film is dull, clichéd and just another film simply serving as a set-up to another Marvel Film. <br/><br/>All in all, it was Ant-man, a generic, by-the-numbers film. <br/><br/>If only Marvel weren't such cowards and let a great director like Edgar Wright direct one of their films for once...."
"rbmaclachlan","8","13","25","1 December 2015"," Enjoyable,funny but weak villain yet again.
","In the beginning when i was growing up i knew of Ant man and was never really sold on the character and him able to shrink wasn't something i liked as a power. Thirty years on and the trailer hits and for some reason i got interested so interested i went to my local comic shop and bought some comics and I am so glad i did because I realised that he really cool.<br/><br/>Now on to the movie I found really enjoyable and very funny the chemistry worked really well with all the cast involved, I will say though that the villain of the piece was a big let down it went down the lines of same old story.<br/><br/>The effects where pretty cool to and all the ants was awesome.<br/><br/>I will say also that I would of loved to have seen what Edger Wright version would been like but it is also good that he wrote this.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is great fun and a great laugh."
"dimbost","3","54","130","30 July 2015"," we finally see people realize that this is the end of good movies
","So, i was thinking. Do i ruin this movie for all of the MCU die hard fan boys or should i go easy on them?...<br/><br/>Well i decided to go easy on them, for now. Ant-Man another addition to Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and it uses the exact same formula as every other film before it. Its kind of Why fix something if its not broken?... Well the formula and success of Marvel films is slowly killing the film industry. How you ask? thanks to its huge popularity and their die hard fans people are starting forgive their films plot holes, continuity errors, poor acting and really bad dialogue that is only purpose is to provide cheap jokes at the expense of the film.<br/><br/>Acting: I have nothing against Paul Rudd, but he is not an action or a serious actor, yes he can be okay to good actor, but not great. His performance in Ant-Man reminded me of his character in almost all of his other films. Not to mention that Corey Stoll and Evangeline Lilly were incredibly bad, and please don't even want to go near the David Dastmalchian Russian accent computer tech, that only spoke to make you laugh at his accent.<br/><br/>Story: is exact same as Iron man, except imagine that Tony was to old to be Iron man and so he needed some one young, trustworthy and who would not be bent on world domination. But lets take it to prospective for those defending the film. We are given over 20-30 minutes of the film time to show how Rudd is training and getting use to the suit and all of its unique abilities and its strength and weaknesses. e.g first time he used, he got sucked up by a vacuum, wind blew him, he didn't know how to use it or control it to fight somebody, because that required certain timing and skill. But when all seems lost and the bad guy decides that his only chance is at putting on the costume, and DAMN!!! that has to be a world record speed!! But he is also instantly aware of all of the timings, and knows everything about the difference of being small and or big. Not only that he is actually better at handling himself then a felon who has had specific training for this exact purpose. But hey its just a film. Now lets get to the worlds most St*pid cops in Movie history. There is funny st*pid and then there is just plain st*pid.<br/><br/>I really hope people realize that films like this are hurting movie industry, because as long as people give them good reviews and continue to support them. Studios will be willing to keep on making half attempts movies, while true movies which people write great scripts, have great actors go unnoticed."

","Me and my kids have enjoyed all of the Marvel films so far, so we went to see Ant Man as soon as we could. Big mistake. I was bored, my kids were bored and kept asking if we could go home. Everything about it is just downer and not what you want from a superhero film. Some of it really isn't appropriate for kids either. <br/><br/>Everybody in the cinema seemed disappointed, we heard a lot of grumbling as we left (and no, it wasn't just about my kids complaining, they were still pretty quiet).<br/><br/>Wish we'd seen something else and we'll have to be more careful about Marvel films in future."

","Bad. Growing up with Marvel comics I expected more from this movie, but I felt like I was watching a film that was made especially for pre-teens and teenagers. <br/><br/>The comedy was bad and unnecessary, Rudd was dreadful as Ant-Man (just as bad as Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern), Evangeline Lilly was horrible as Hope Van Dyke, and Corey Stoll was a cliché goof ball as a villain. The entire story was bad, the fact that this guy is completely trained in martial arts in days is a terrible concept, and the idea that the bad guys are shooting guns at ants -ANTS - is beyond ridiculous.<br/><br/>Since Marvel took over production of it's movies, it is rare that I am disappointed - but this movie was as bad as Daredevil and close to as abysmal as Elektra. I would not recommend this movie at all."

"CinemaClown","Null","13","26","22 November 2015"," Neither Amongst Marvel's Best Works Nor Refreshing Enough As A Standalone Flick
","The twelfth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the final chapter of their Phase Two plan, Ant-Man is a small-scale, light-hearted & sufficiently entertaining blockbuster that brings a new superhero into the already crammed Marvel family and although it may not be as heavy handed as some of their biggest extravaganzas, there's hardly anything refreshing about it.<br/><br/>Ant-Man tells the story of Scott Lang; an engineer turned criminal who wants to support his daughter but is unable to secure any job due to his criminal record. Things are set in motion when he decides to commit a burglary with his crew and steals a super-suit that allows him to shrink in scale & amplify in strength, following which he assists the suit's owner in pulling off a heist that will save the world.<br/><br/>Directed by Peyton Reed, Ant-Man was initially supposed to be Edgar Wright's pet project, who worked on it for years before being removed by the studio after creative differences arose between the two. What Reed has done after taking the director's helm from Wright is that he has completely modified the script in order for the film to fit into Marvel's existing universe, which is in contrast to Wright's vision who intended it as a standalone feature.<br/><br/>While one can argue over just how much was chopped out & what all was retained from the original screenplay, it would've been quite interesting to see Wright's take on the minuscule superhero. Nevertheless, Reed's take isn't a total disaster for the movie actually feels like a typical Marvel flick with its simple plot, charming lead, playful wit, fun vibe & family-friendly entertainment. And although it will satisfy majority of mainstream viewers, it could've been much more improved.<br/><br/>The set pieces come in all shape & sizes this time and with added enhancements from the visual effects department, they look detailed enough. Cinematography makes heavy use of macro photography & many interesting point-of-view shots while kinetic camera-work drives its action. Thanks to its predictable plot & some lame attempts at humour which don't work out, its 117 minutes of runtime is felt at times. Visual effects is top-notch as expected while Christophe Beck's score feels pretty generic.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Ant-Man features a good cast in Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Michael Peña & others, and most of them do a fine job in their given roles. Rudd, however, is a revelation for he proves that he can be charming enough in the lead role of a big-budget blockbuster. His performance as Lang is well-balanced and he carries most of the film on his own. Douglas is in as Hank Pym but chips in with a mediocre input. Lilly does well with what she's given, Peńa is annoying & Stoll isn't really intimidating as the villain.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ant-Man delivers the big-budget extravaganza it promised, even if it is on smaller scale when compared to its predecessors but from the storytelling perspective, it definitely ranks amongst Marvel Studios' weaker entries, that may have been avoided if it had added greater depth to its main plot & characters. Even though this film is designated by Marvel as their Phase Two finale, it works more or less as a prologue for Phase Three. A playful introduction to a new character & spearheaded by Paul Rudd's on-screen charisma, Ant-Man is no quality blockbuster but it's still worth one viewing, at least."
"justinwfirestone","7","19","41","21 July 2015"," Let's get small.
","I must admit that I never got into comic books, so when I heard Paul Rudd would be Marvel's Ant-Man, I had to read the Ant-Man Wikipedia entry just to make sure it wasn't some total prank. Stupid me, he first appeared in 1962, no doubt capitalizing on those halcyon days when the young males across America were obsessed with ants, quantum theory, and microphilia in general.<br/><br/>I'm not the only one with a bit of disbelief. While I was waiting in line to see Terminator Genisys, a stranger pointed over to the Ant- Man poster and said, ""Ant-Man?! Man, they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for these Marvel movies.""<br/><br/>But let's not make a mountain out of an ant hill. The Ant-Man movie is the light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek, self-aware, almost campy movie that I wanted Avengers: Age of Ultron to be. Paul Rudd is the best casting of a Marvel hero since Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. Michael Douglas brings some class to the whole affair, Evangeline Lilly isn't given a ton to work with but succeeds at being told she's crucial yet largely relegated to behind-the-scenes work, and Michael Peña provides some nice laughs as a goofy and cocksure sidekick.<br/><br/>Once again, the villain is actually science, or at least cutting- edge science. That's because the technology that makes the Ant-Man possible, the Pym particle, could be used for a lot of good, but in the wrong hands, it will surely be used for a lot of bad. And you can tell immediately that Corey Stoll as Darren Cross is bad because he's bald. He pretty monolithically bad, the only reason for which seems to be that Dr. Pym wouldn't raise him as a surrogate father figure.<br/><br/>All of the summer blockbusters now require some throwaway side story about divorce and wanting to be better parents for their kids. I wish all those side stories would go subatomic and be lost forever, allowing for more time to ""mount the thorax.""<br/><br/>Ant-Man can control ants, too! But he can't until he learns how to clear his mind. So Hope van Dyne tells him to think of his daughter. Simple! Easy peasy, calabrese! He can't fly, though, even though some ants can fly. This all becomes problematic when Yellowjacket shows up and can fly and shoot lasers. Lasers seem lame when Yellowjacket could've had cannons that transform living creatures into small piles of ectoplasmic goop.<br/><br/>As in Terminator Genisys, a total victory for the good guys includes blowing up a server farm. Good thing Darren Cross, just like Skynet, never heard of putting data way up high in The Cloud.<br/><br/>The final battle includes some imagery that almost made me wish I'd seen it in 3D, or at least after enjoying some medicinal tea. It hasn't been this much fun to be small since Rick Moranis shrunk his kids."

It is predictable and slow in its useless 'grab the viewer' tenet. Nothing ever happens of great interest and Paul Rudd is totally not up to the job of his portrayal. The first twenty minutes are a work class in how NOT to make a movie. If Alfred Hitchcock had made this, then you could forget about a future gem like Psycho being made. The directer, Peyton Reed, does not have any imagination and should be ashamed of this abominable mess of digital inferiority. You could not pay me to watch this garbage again. I think, in real life, that Peyton Reed is only 2mm in stature. His movie is much smaller than that. Please excuse me, I need to go and vomit in a thimble."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.7/5 stars<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" may boast the world's smallest superhero but the latest offering from the mighty Marvel studios is big on fun, ingenuity, action, humor, witty dialogues, and most of all, a tight, well- conceived, wholly involving script. Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd, and a formidable antagonist in Corey Stoll along with strong supporting acts by Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michael Peña, ""Ant-Man"" offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale, yet seamlessly manages to firmly lodge itself right up there with the studio's best efforts.<br/><br/>The next evolution of the Marvel Cinematic Universe brings a founding member of The Avengers to the big screen for the first time with Marvel Studios' ""Ant-Man"". Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats. Against seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Pym and Lang must plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.<br/><br/>When you get right down to it, there is something rather amusing about watching a protagonist the size of a fingernail doing ambitious stunt work while he attempts to survive dangerous obstacles; wherein lies ""Ant-Man's"" best quality – it doesn't try to be a superhero movie yet it fluidly showcases all the craziness, charm, wit, and restricted mayhem associated with the best and infinitely more popular comic book characters. What's also surprising is just how hilarious the movie is in its entirety; even becoming a challenger to last year's spectacular ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" in terms of impressive comedic chops effortlessly intertwined within a blockbuster action bonanza.<br/><br/>The primary reason why ""Ant-Man"" packs such an entertaining punch is because it uses big-movie tricks sans big-movie hyperbole. It's fun, frothy, and light-hearted while also being an enthralling and memorable movie-watching experience, and convincingly carves a niche for itself as a worthy part of the Marvel canon. For once the bad buzz and subpar trailers were wrong. This hero deserves a movie of his own, and then a sequel or maybe two."

"Troy_Campbell","6","16","34","17 July 2015"," A light-hearted adventure.
","Even by comic-book movie standards, a thief who can shrink himself to the size of an insect – as well as being able to telepathically control ants – is a totally bonkers premise for a blockbuster. As their sensational Guardians of the Galaxy proved, however, Marvel Studios isn't afraid to take left-field ideas and turn them into cinematic gold. It's a shame then, that Ant-Man is more of a mildly diverting setup for phase three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rather than a wholly entertaining flick that can stand on its own two legs. It's also arguably the least action-centric Marvel film to date, with barely a punch thrown or weapon fired until the final act, save for an unexpected (and highly enjoyable) scrap between the titular hero and a recognisable face. Where this idiosyncratic heist flick scores big points though, is in the comedy department. With a script worked on by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish and Paul Rudd, it's hardly surprising to find a tongue-in-cheek tone and a healthy splattering of jokes; Michael Pena's goofy sidekick bagging the biggest laugh with an energetic monologue. On leading man duties, Rudd is eminently lovable as burglar Scott Lang – his effortless charm ideal for such a breezy adventure – whilst Michael Douglas brings gravitas to mentor Hank Pym. Coming so soon after Terminator: Genisys gave us a decent-looking youthful Arnie, the digitally de-aged Douglas in the opening scene here is scarily good too, with the CGI staying at a top level throughout. Devoid of an interesting villain and largely lacking in thrills, this is somewhat of a missed opportunity in the Marvel universe. Yet with a strong protagonist (who will be superb when thrown into the Avenger mix), a solid gag rate, and a light-hearted mood (resulting in a PG rating), it's an amusing film suitable for the whole family."
"ivo-cobra8","10","5","8","30 April 2017"," One of my all time favorite MARVEL superheros movies
","Ant-Man (2015) is my all time favorite MARVEL film it is my fourth favorite MARVEL film the first three are Captain America trilogy that I love to death while this movie stays right behind them. It is a fun and entertaining film and I have really enjoyed it, I don't have any problem with the film and I never really read the comic about Ant-Man, but watching this movie it is really solid super-hero movie. Ant-Man is MILES way better than Deadpool (2016) who get's so much praise for it! It is MILES way better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse and Hulk (2003) those movies really sucked. Ant-Man (2015) is better than those movies that is just my opinion you even have a solid cast. I love that Ant-Man doesn't kill people and when they blow up the building no one is hurt, that makes him a superhero. <br/><br/>I am a big fan of Michael Douglas and he does an excellent job as Hank Pym he was excellent. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was incredible. I mostly remember him from Friends when he played Mike, Phoebe's boyfriend and he make the movie with Jennifer Aniston also from Friends) The Object of My Affection (1998) he was terrific in Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly from Lost and Real Steel is incredible excellent as Hope Pym who is Hank's daughter. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket was good at in his acting performance as the villain and last and at least Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon was wonderful to see him in this movie I loved it.<br/><br/>Plot: Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world. <br/><br/>I love the film because it has a heart and it has a redemption, everyone deserves a second chance. It also has a strong message bonding estrange father and daughter together. Scott Lang is a former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength. The movie is an origin story of the petty crook Scott Lang who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in. He becomes Ant-Man and he is doing the right things for his daughter. He's ex wife throws him out while her new boyfriend is a cop pursuing Lang, he has one chance to make this right to be in his daughter's life. REDEMPTION.<br/><br/>I have enjoy the visuals effects and the CGI was pretty good creating Ant-Man I didn't mind it. Checked Ant Man out again very fun entertaining comic book movie that didn't use the alien invasion angle, falling buildings or the world is gonna end, just a simple story, great visual effects and likable characters. The Ant-Man/Falcon fight was bad ass and I loved how Ant-Man defeated him. He saved his daughter Cassie and he showed that he is a good father. In the comics he used pills instead of discs to enlarge and shrink things. I think that was a good change they made. <br/><br/>A final battle scene in the daughters bedroom on her Thomas Tank engine train track, imaginative an original and fun. Marvel's latest may not be their greatest achievement but yet another gamble for a character that is less then popular in that Universe. Adding the legendary Michael Douglas to the cast was pure genius much as Robert Redford played along in The Winter Soldier. The overall movie is fun and the execution of performances are fine but Ant-Man doesn't quite have the punch that I was expecting nor rank in the top five of all the Marvel films thus far. However the character should have a few solo efforts in the pipeline not to mention he's be seen in Civil War and most likely the next two Avenger Infinity War movies.<br/><br/>The rating I give to this film is 10/10 it is my favorite MARVEL film I own it on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it watching it, it is a pretty damn solid good movie at least for me. <br/><br/>Ant-Man is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name: Scott Lang and Hank Pym.

"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","17","38","15 July 2015"," Ant music - uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!...
","From the opening scene, which we get *before* the 'Marvel Studios' logo appears, you know things are going to be a bit different with this movie compared to the other Marvel films thus far. It was a nice surprise to see Hayley Atwell (once again rocking the convincing old age makeup) as an older Peggy Carter, who appears alongside a more youthful-looking Michael Douglas as Hank Pym and John Slattery's Howard Stark. After this set-up, we're introduced to Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, the film's hero, in a scene that you think you've watched many times before - the hero getting beaten up, only to fight back and win - but is in fact something else. I appreciated this shake-up to the formula we've become accustomed to over time. And that's this film's main takeaway - it mixes things up a bit (no small feat), which is sometimes a positive and sometimes a negative. The beginning, for example, is much slower-paced than perhaps most are used to. The setting up of the characters, etc is rather low-key in comparison to other Marvel films. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd is likable enough as Scott, who's a burglar, but also a guy trying to do right by his daughter (which is at the film's heart), an ordinary guy who gets some funny lines (Rudd's extra-dry delivery is welcome), but isn't some rapid-fire snark-spouting machine, and thankfully not an a-hole (unlike certain 'billionaire playboy philanthropists' who'll continue to take over EVERYTHING). Playing well off Rudd is Evangeline Lilly, sporting toned arms as Hank's daughter, Hope van Dyne. While in the beginning of the film it seems like she's just going to be filling the 'mean pretty lady' role, teaching Scott how to throw a punch and not getting along with him, she does eventually go from despising him to almost-liking him, and this is where you see her character is much more than she may first appear (just like how Scott's ex-wife's new husband, Paxton, played by Bobby Cannavale, seems kind of a jerk for most of the movie, but eventually shows he's a decent guy). She also clashes with her father, but shares a number of emotional scenes with him, where Lilly displays her range. She's not only capable of throwing a punch and delivering verbal barbs, but also showing humanity when it counts, softening somewhat in later scenes, but never losing her edge. In the mid-credits scene, she even gets to deliver a line which not only serves her character well, but also sums up the viewing public's thoughts when it comes to women headlining comic book movies. Lilly proved herself more than capable in a female action role as Tauriel in the last two Hobbit movies (even if the final one did her character a disservice), and this movie promises more great things to come from her. She does a lot with a little and I really liked her dynamics with Scott and her father. Speaking of Hank, Douglas lends some real weight to the film, playing the old Ant-Man who needs someone to take over from him. The way he tests Scott makes for the film's first action sequence. <br/><br/>The shrinking effects on display aren't the old-style Honey, I Shrunk The Kids type of thing, but more refined, the concept of Ant-Man allowing for something definitely different to what we're used to when it comes to Marvel movie action sequences. Scott's first shrinking was quite effective, conveying just how dangerous everyday normal things can be when you're the size of an ant. The upside is that ants become his allies and he develops a friendship with one particular flying ant who he names Antony (and if you didn't see the conclusion to this friendship coming from a mile away...clearly you haven't seen Honey, I Shrunk The Kids). It's nice to see Scott's bonding with his various insect allies, especially given that at the other end of the spectrum is Corey Stoll's nasty badguy, Darren Cross, whose experiments lead to a virtual Violence of the Lambs horror show, reducing test subjects to bloody phlegm (why'd they have to do that to the cutest lamb ever?! At least Hope was upset by it). His is the latest in a long line of sub-par/underwhelming villains Marvel has dished out (really, the memorable ones can be counted on one hand...after losing a few digits), but at least he didn't get all shout-y (like so many seem to) until towards the end - which I was thankful for. He's adequate in the role, but nothing particularly memorable. Perhaps if he could've worked in ""Dead-ant, dead-ant/Dead-ant, dead- ant dead-ant dead-ant dead-ant..."" when threatening Ant-Man? Scott's heist buddies, referred to as ""wombats"" by Douglas' Pym, are alright. They're mostly played for laughs, with varying degrees of success, but aren't entirely useless either. <br/><br/>Apparently director Edgar Wright, who was a big fan of Ant-Man, proposed his idea for the movie and had begun developing it, only to drop out due to 'creative differences'. After reading that Joss Whedon thought it was ""the best script that Marvel had ever had"", I'm itching to know what that film would've been like. There's some real nice elements to this movie (with, unfortunately, some of the best moments given away in the trailers - like the Thomas the Tank Engine scene, although there's another funny scene involving Ping-Pong), but it feels very different to what's come before. For people having trouble with the concept, remember this is the same universe that asked you to buy a talking raccoon and Treebeard's monosyllabic cousin. While this movie must be commended for bringing something new to the table, it didn't quite reach the levels of enjoyment set by the Thor, Captain America and Avengers movies for me, but others might enjoy it more. Look out for a couple Avenger-related cameos and stick around, while Christophe Beck's catchy/memorable Ant-Man theme music plays, for the mid-credits and after-credits sequences promising more interesting things to come."
"FeastMode","7","3","4","26 June 2019"," funny and awesome
","Awesome, entertaining movie. cool concept taken in lots of cool directions. did a good job of being exciting without needing to be epic. the fight scenes were hard to follow at times but there was a lot of good action. and it was very funny. funny characters, dialogue, and situational humor (5 viewings, 4/29/2020)"
"TheLittleSongbird","7","3","4","30 May 2016"," Minor Marvel, but still good Marvel
","Having enjoyed a vast majority of Marvel's superhero output (more so than most) without worshipping them, 'Ant-Man' is a minor effort from them but there is still a good amount to like about it.<br/><br/>'Ant-Man' manages to be a better film than expected. The character is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that have had longer longevity and perhaps have more compelling origins and stories, hence why they are adapted more. Also wasn't sure what to make of the trailer, which made the film out to be rather bland and too reliant on humour.<br/><br/>Seeing it for myself finally a year on, 'Ant-Man' could have been better. While the humour mostly works wonders, there are a few instances where it's not so funny and not very well placed, like in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches. Corey Stoll also goes through the motions as the rather generic and under-characterised villain.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 'Ant-Man' is a great looking film, it's beautifully shot, very atmospheric, is very slick and the special effects, mostly the rapid size-changing and with the ants, are clever and of the usual high-quality Marvel standards. The music avoids being over-bearing, one-note, too quirky or too bombastic, fitting well tone, mood and pace-wise. Direction is more than competent, keeping the story going at a solid pace and the telling of it interesting enough, though maybe a little more flavour may have been more welcome. While the action is not as much as most Marvel films, it is fun, thrilling, nicely choreographed and tautly shot and edited, especially towards the end. Admittedly there are a couple of cheesy parts towards the end too, but kind of in an endearing rather than jarring way and it doesn't jar with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There is some very smart and hugely entertaining scripting and dialogue here in 'Ant-Man' too. While it doesn't work completely seamlessly, 'Ant-Man' is one of Marvel's generally consistently funniest films, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously or too much of a joke either, instead not being afraid to embrace the silliness and humour while ensuring still that the subject matter is treated with respect. It is especially good with the title character's deadpan quips and Luis' fast-talking patter. The story is mostly diverting, it's narratively simpler than most Marvel outings and less risks here are taken than most Marvel films but it always makes sense, moments of dullness and jarring are few (while not being completely absent either), it's fun and it doesn't try to do too much or try to insert too many characters while not playing things too safe either.<br/><br/>While not complex as such, the characters are mostly engaging and are not too one-dimensional, only the villain could have had more done with him. Paul Rudd is a strong and hugely entertaining lead, while Michael Peña's hilarious in a role that could have been really annoying. The seasoned support of Michael Douglas adds hugely too, and Evangeline Lilly gives the film some much needed heart. Anthony Mackie is good too.<br/><br/>Overall, minor Marvel but good Marvel. Well-made and a lot of fun, but there is a personal preference to the Marvel films that took bigger risks with more and often richer characters, bigger bolder action and more going on in the story. 'Ant-Man' executes a vast majority of its components really well indeed, just that Marvel has done even better before and since. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","""Give the audience what they want"": it's been a staple of Marvel's on-screen storytelling for years. It's produced franchises, crossovers and billions of dollars, but along the way someone forgot to tell the studio giants what keeps movies fresh: variety. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd is Scott Lang, a cat burglar ex-con keen to quit ""the life"" and make amends with his young daughter. After denying several advances from his old crew of bumbling thieves (Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian and rapper T.I.), Lang is approached by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the original Ant-Man, with an offer to steal a copycat suit and prevent it being sold for warfare.<br/><br/>Even a screenplay co-written by the clever Edgar Wright (The World's End, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) can't polish the studio's insistence on returning to the same tired, formulaic jokes time after time. <br/><br/>With each new film, Marvel's cinematic universe continues to cross more broadly the line separating action and comedy. This is all well and good, provided the humour carries some wit or originality with it, which this film does not. Were it not for the comedic sensibilities of Rudd and the malleable Pena, Ant-Man would be the most groan-inducing Marvel release yet.<br/><br/>Rudd makes a very likable hero, and Douglas gives a typically committed performance. Corey Stoll's Darren Cross, though, makes for a pretty goofy villain. His involvement in the story may have worked better did he not take himself so seriously, as he sticks out sorely in an otherwise lighthearted movie. His cliché-ridden dialogue during the climax feels lazy and brutally exposes the character's hollowness as a true threat.<br/><br/>Still, the film has its positives. The story is well paced, and the balance it strikes between a smaller scale adventure and one that still manages to feel important is a welcome change from the unfettered CGI carnage that comes packaged with some of the studio's bigger names. <br/><br/>The refreshing absence of exploding buildings and forty-minute firefights allow director Peyton Reed (Yes Man) to explore fun, unique fight scenes that make the most of Ant-Man's abilities.<br/><br/>The film also does a good job of taking what could've been the lamer aspects of the character – namely, his ability to make actual ants do his bidding – and explaining them in a way that sounds practical and important.<br/><br/>Ant-Man isn't the most insulting film of the summer. It just falters in the same places that have kept the MCU in a rut for far too long.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"

","Baskin-Robbins always finds out. - Scott Lang<br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... Hopefully, Marvel does not take themselves too seriously with this film and we can all have some fun with the action. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4.25 stars Cinematic value: 4.5 stars Big questions value: 3 stars<br/><br/>Marvel is attempting to pull off a heist. Ant-man is their opportunity to prove themselves in another cinematic genre. Paul Rudd (Role Models) as the lead in this miniature hero caper is a stretch to consider for heroics, but the whole concept of Ant-man movie is a stretch. It is possible that this comedic actor could be right to provide the 'nudge, nudge, wink, wink' element of this heist film, but can this film be taken seriously?<br/><br/>Rudd plays the con-man, Scott Lang who is recruited by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to pull off the recovery of another super-suit that provides the same abilities as the Ant-man suit. Pym was the original mini powerhouse and alongside his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) attempts to mentor the brilliant burglar. They strive to use his less than savoury skills as a thief to save the world and to fill the hero role that has been repressed for years. The Pyms and Lang must team up to stop the plans of Darren Scott (Corey Stoll) who has sinister plans for Dr. Pym's formula and the new yellowjacket suit. For Lang, the motivation to save the world comes secondary to saving his relationship with his daughter which provides a fascinating restoration theme to this mad-capped adventure. In the end, can director Peyton Reed (Yes Man) manage the daunting task of making this microscopic hero into a believable superhero?<br/><br/>Let all the doubt and scepticism cease, Reed delivers on this formidable task. He proves that size does not diminish the impact of this superhero within the Marvel Universe. Most comic book adaptations have well placed dialogue and humour placed in between a multitude of action scenes. Reed turns this concept around and manages to make a laugh- out-loud, heist film that is connected by convincing action scenarios. In an era where graphic novels are getting pulled into a darker realm, Ant-man provides a superhero that does not take himself too seriously. Reed even manages to make light of product placement and uses it to provide some of the most endearing lines in the script. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd is perfect in the role of Scott Lang. His portrayal of the smart, comedic, but flawed character is what this film needs for fun and believability. His burgling entourage make for a humorous, mad-capped origin story that leaves you wanting to see more of them in the future. It was great to see Michael Douglas (both young and old) on the screen with the convincing old swagger needed for this minuscule mentor. Evangeline Lilly moves successfully from The Hobbit trilogy to Ant-man to establish herself as a convincing heroine with her understated vulnerability and strength. The makers of Ant-man have managed to do something different with this superhero journey, they make it accessible to a wider age bracket. Having a PG rating, this is the first crusader caper that parents would not have to hesitate taking their children to experience. Overall, it provides the balance between action, comedy, heart and a new puzzle piece to the Marvel world.<br/><br/>Throughout the humour and action, there was an overarching theme of redemption. Scott Lang and Dr. Pym have their own redemptive journeys to travel. Their choices in life have caused casualties in their familial ties. The Ant-man narrative has a redeeming message woven into the central characters lives. In any super hero tale there is evidence of power and strength, which can be seen in this insect dominated story, but without giving anything away, the power of the film comes in the relationships of family and the need for atonement. Both of these men show that their children are the only individuals that need to see them as a hero. This redemptive element adds a depth and freshness to this superhero tale. Coming from a cinematic sceptic, this film manages to make its presence known on all levels, representing a pure exploit in fun and has the potential to steal the heart of any audience member.<br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Ant-man will put your faith back into the superhero genre. It is action-packed fun for the whole family. <br/><br/>What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Does size matter when it comes to heroics? (1 Samuel 16:7, Matthew 13:31-32) 2. Can we become better as humans?' (Genesis 1:27, Mark 7:20-23) 3. Can mankind's hearts change from evil to good?

","Ant-Man is not just another super hero movie from the Marvel series, but a phenomenal expression of team work. Need to see how this movie depicts the strength of the Ant Family and power of leadership is all about trust. There was on classic scene where the Ant-man as a leader shows such compassion for his team. <br/><br/>Ant-Man is also about family values and love for daughters. <br/><br/>Great Casting by the director for this movie and quite a lot of witty scenes. Michael Douglas still rocks Hollywood. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily what a contrast. Corey Stoll does quite the villain. Ant-Man is surely a must watch, especially families with children."
"ddoyle2017","6","13","28","20 July 2015"," Wasn't Marvel's Best
","Marvel movies have become the kings at the box office these days. It seems like Marvel Studios can't fail, at least in the last few years. Ant Man might not be making the amount of money that Marvel was hoping for, but it's gotten a great response critically. i just didn't find it that fun. It was stupid and slow. i didn't feel that it had the flow that regular Marvel movies have. I'll confess that there were some funny lines in the movie, but it felt like they had to add a lot of it in there to make up for the stupidity of the movie. I know what your thinking, ""None of the marvel superheroes make sense. There is a monster called the Hulk on a team of Avengers."" But, at least the Hulk has a good back story and is played by a good actor. He is also a bad ass with all of his strength. Ant Man seemed stupid with all of the controlling ants and stuff. The shrinking was cool and powerful, but the ants were stupid and seemed to crawl out of nowhere when Scott needed them. In the comics, Ant Man didn't rely so heavily on the ant and more on his own powers. I have to say that Yellow Jacket was really cool, especially his suit. The only complaint that I have is that it looks like he could take down Ant Man easily, but he didn't because it didn't fit the plot. He is by far the stronger person. The last thing that I want to say is that the movie started to become to much like Green Lantern when the tank came out of the building. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie could've been better but was still a lot of fun."
"d-mcpeake","5","22","53","2 August 2015"," The decline of the Marvel Movies continues
","The Disney Marvel Engine seems to be running out of steam with this emotionless film that put even the children in the audience to sleep. This film was a bog standard intro movie who's only purpose seems to be to introduce the characters for the next one. 90% Build up 10% anti-climax. The cast didn't seem comfortable being on the same set as each other let alone the same room, with no notable performances from any of the human cast members. Despite a few chuckle worthy moments late on the film remains very disappointing. If this is the future of the franchise, best to cut our losses and savor the memories of those earlier gems. Getting very worried about the next franchise if this is what we can expect from Disney."
"quincytheodore","8","14","31","16 July 2015"," Lighter on the theme and scale, Ant-Man carries robust size of comedy and charm
","For the uninitiated on comic lore, first exposure to Ant-Man movie should be something similar to confused wondering expression or mild amusement seeing its witty poster or advertisement. Fortunately, the movie instills the fun atmosphere as it takes jab on its own diminutive size. This is not the bombastic scale of Avengers, and thankfully it doesn't try to. Ant-Man creates its unique identity with mild fun entertainment, and it's a big merry escapade in its own right.<br/><br/>Story basically follows Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) as he tries to keep his size altering invention hidden from prying hands. As luck would have it, his path crosses with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), an ex-con who happens to be a resourceful thief. The two eventually orchestrate elaborate heist to secure the atom manipulation tech. The movie is practically a heist comedy with a touch of action.<br/><br/>Most of the flair and jokes work due to Paul Rudd's carefree yet magnetic performance. He's embodied the sharp humor and more family friendly approach to the superhero concept. It's good to see that it doesn't venture to overly serious tone or world calamity subject like his superhuman peers.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes, Ant-Man is a fun comedy at heart. The family theme is very prevalent, mostly dealing with parental issue and personal acceptance. The humor works well thanks to the cast such as Michael Pena and Evangeline Lily as they simply look like they are having a good time. There's great chemistry between the on-screen characters as they trade banters, down to smallest easily digestible quips.<br/><br/>Just like Marvel movies before it, Ant-Man possesses quite the spectacle with special effect. Expect lots of fireworks and fisticuffs yet in less harrowing set-up. It's a fresh change of pace after the colossal flying city from last Avengers movie, furthermore it's interesting to see the difference in scope.<br/><br/>A superhero of different size, stealthily captivating and smile-inducing, Ant-man delivers big enough leisure and hilarity to stand amongst the giants."

","Ant-man does a lot of things Right. Paul Rudd was great casting, Michael Douglas pull in a great performance when a lot of actors with his carrier and experience might have just phoned it in. The few times the humour does hit it hits hard, Especially from Michael Peña. Also the micro Cinematography is Beautiful.<br/><br/>But, The Lack of Edger Wright, The rush on the script and The Poor director Choice (Marvel was forced to make) Really shows. The passing is all over the place, the film at several point tries to tie in to the marvel universe and it honestly feels forced. The movie bring up concepts and ideas that could lead us to a deeper Understanding and interest in the charters. Like the reason why Hank Pim cant no longer be Ant- man or Hanks Relationship with Howard stark (Tony stark AKA iron mans dad) or why one charter is effected by (Pim particle exposure and another isn't)<br/><br/>These things could add to the universe and the story as a whole but rather adds to our disbelief. The few times it tries to Pay Some of them off it doesn't work. Also the antagonist of the film Played by Corey Stoll Feel as if at times he was trying to Imitate his House of cards Co-star Kevin spacey the other times he is a serviceable actor to a poorly Written villain.<br/><br/>Marvel hasn't really made a bad MCU movie so me saying this is one of the worst Marvel films isn't very dramatic and holds little weight. Its not as bad as Iron man 2 But, Like it this film Introduces a lot of great Possible Concepts Ideas and future story lines, That makes this movie Worth seeing. Please don't go in to this movie expecting the new iron man but go in to it. As if its something completely new and hold no expectations. 6.5 out of 10"
"Anders_S_Christensen","4","22","54","10 August 2015"," Overrated
","A very enjoyable movie, yet it never meets the very high standard we have come to expect from watching the trailer. For me it never captivated my imagination, based on this movie I'm not convinced that an ant can be a superhero. Overall this is a very good film when you consider acting, direction, effects and everything else. It's the plot that lags behind. Don't get me wrong, the storyline has only minor plot holes, it just isn't actually very interesting. If you want a movie about the beginning of a new superhero, and how they came to be you should watch Batman Begins. If you want a very impressive superhero with plenty of flair, watch Iron Man... What I'm trying to say is that this movie has already been done only better than Ant-Man.<br/><br/>Ant-Man simply does not live up to the standards, that we could have hoped for and were promised."
"3xHCCH","9","13","29","16 July 2015"," Size Does Not Matter
","I was not really aware of a Marvel character named Ant-Man until recently when articles and trailers about this film began coming out. I was not really that excited until I learned that he was actually one of the original Avengers, then that really got my interest piqued to go watch this one and learn about this previously unfamiliar superhero.<br/><br/>Hank Pym was a noted scientist who discovered how to reduce the distance between atoms, enabling objects to be shrunk. Pym suppressed his discovery because of its dangers, which led to the death of his wife. Obsessed, his protégé Darren Cross eventually develops his own shrinking technology but with less than noble purposes in mind. <br/><br/>In order to prevent potential disaster, Pym decided to recruit Scott Lang, an electronics engineer turned petty burglar, to steal Cross' Yellowjacket project. To be able to achieve this mission, Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne, trained Lang to become a micro- superhero who can communicate and command ants to do his bidding -- the Ant-Man.<br/><br/>I did not know anything about the Ant-Man, his origin and abilities going in, but this film made me a new fan of this cool superhero. Director Peyton Reed only had mostly comedies like ""Bring It On"" (2000), ""Down with Love"" (2003) and ""The Break-Up"" (2006) in his resume. But with his first foray into the superhero genre, he totally made ""Ant-Man"" an exciting and riveting film that holds your attention from beginning to end with its excellent action and crackling humor. Reed took over from original director/scriptwriter Edward Wright, who dropped out of the project citing creative differences with Disney. <br/><br/>For me, the casting of 46 year old Paul Rudd in the lead role came totally from left field. Since his breakthrough role as Josh in ""Clueless"" (1995), Rudd was only relegated playing mainly supporting roles in small unmemorable comedies. However, like his ""Parks and Recreation"" co-star Chris Pratt's success as Peter Quill/Star Lord before him, Rudd actually fit right into character as Scott Lang. Rudd had that good-boy charm which was able to make us sympathetic to this small-time crook desperately wanting to do good for the sake of his daughter Cassie (played by Abby Ryder Fortson). <br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly proved that the action skills she showed as the elf Tauriel in the last two Hobbit films were no fluke. Her Hope van Dyne is fierce with attitude, with toned arms and shoulders to boot. I do take exception to her annoying hairstyle that was reminiscent of that worn by Dallas Bryce Howard on ""Jurassic World"". What's up with that ""Dora""-do with the bangs and Hollywood nowadays?<br/><br/>The role of Hank Pym could have been dry and didactic in the hands of another actor, but Michael Douglas really made this character vital and interesting. His sense of humor was on point. His was the character that was connected with everyone else being the original Ant-Man, and he had excellent working chemistry with everyone: Scott, Hope and villain Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll).<br/><br/>Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and rapper T.I. played a comical trio of petty crooks with whom Scott hung around. They provide additional humor to the proceedings, especially when things get serious towards the climax. Bobby Cannavale played a clueless cop Paxton who is now the new husband of Scott's ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer), and step father to Cassie. His character made Scott's life considerably more complicated.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this film were top rate, particularly the amazing visual effects. I really liked the scenes of Ant-Man interacting with the different types of ants. The fight scene of Ant-Man vs. a special guest Avenger was also very well-executed. Those scenes in little Cassie's room where there was a carpeted play area with a toy Thomas train running on its tracks was way better than how it looked in the trailer. The expert film editing was seamless even as scenes (and the sizes of the characters) were shifting so quickly. <br/><br/>Aside from mentions of Stark, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, there were also two scenes in the end credits (one mid-credit, and another one at the very end) which reveal how Ant-Man will fit into the current Marvel Cinematic Universe situation. Unlike the rather disappointing, heavy- handed ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" right before it, ""Ant-Man"" was entertaining beyond my expectations. Marvel does it again! 9/10."

","""Ant-Man"" is a nice change of pace from all the Marvel Universe movies that we have been getting in this 2010s. Instead of being a serious movie, or one packed with superheroes fighting against yet another city that is falling on their heads, it centers on a very simple idea: a heist. And it does a good enough job in making it fun, but it also has a very uneven tone and doesn't make any sense throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>Dr. Hank Pym was Ant-Man many many years ago, but decided to give up and hide his suit behind a safe in his house. But when his former pupil Darren Cross comes close to creating something similar with a new suit called Yellowjacket, he knows he has top Cross. And he decides to get the help of Scott Lang, a former convict, to steal the new suit. Will Scott Lang help Dr. Hank Pym and become the new Ant-Man? And will they be in time to stop Darren Cross?<br/><br/>The movie follows the 101 heist book from beginning to the end, but mixed with the superhero formula. You have the rag-a-tag team of losers that helps the hero, the old person with the info and the mission, the other one that wants to be the hero (in this case Dr. Hank Pym's daughter Hope)... It is not very original, but it is fast-paced enough that you won't even notice. And the acting is good enough (even if the direction comes and goes). The plot development is OK, and as it doesn't have so much overlap with other Marvel movies, it can stand on its own two feet without much problems. And it tries to be funny (too much), and has some nice jokes to keep things easy and not very serious.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it makes no sense whatsoever (it looks as it had a half-baked script), and as said, as the direction come and goes, it falls into some empty moments that distract from the movie. The worst sin, though, it is its over-reliance on special effects, especially in the third act, with way too much CGI that wasn't necessary. It is a problem many of the superhero movies seem to have: an overlong third act with just explosions, punches and things flying around. At least this time they put some humour, but it is still way too long.<br/><br/>All in all, not the greatest superhero movie ever, but one fun and totally enjoyable."

","Ant-Man is the next......... stuff it, you know what is by now, it's a Marvel film, so get up and go see it. This is by far the best origin story of a Marvel superhero so far (Guardians not included), and one of the better Marvel films to date. It did exactly what all or most of the Marvel films seem to do so well and that is the ability to combine action and comedy in a way that provides a near perfect balance of both. Another thing the film makers did amazingly was they made the movie feel like its own individual film and it could stand on its own if you just decided to watch this film without seeing any other Marvel film. Of course, it still had its fair share of winks and surprises, some very obvious and some not so obvious, so you know that this is very much a part of the Marvel universe. Lets talk about the characters in the film, because it is fair to say that those who know nothing about the Marvel comics will have absolutely no idea who any of these characters are, even i was unfamiliar with a few of them. These characters were so fun to watch, both the good and bad, mainly because they were not cliché characters, they all had an introduction and back-story that made them feel like very real people. The other thing that made the characters so great were the actors' performances, Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and even Corey Stoll were fantastic and very convincing in their roles. Even the supporting cast were hilarious and fun to watch and fit into the film really well. <br/><br/>As for the plot it really was pretty simple (""Break into a place and steal some stuff""), but at the same time it was very interesting and a fun ride. It wasn't at all predictable and offered enough new elements to make it different from other heist films. It did take a little bit to actually get going and for the main plot to really kick in, but being an origin story where you have to set up these brand new characters it is understandable. So in the end, if you are a fan of the other Marvel films then you already know what you are getting into, it has all of the fun, comedy and action you expect. If you are unfamiliar with the other Marvel films, firstly, where have you been the last 7 years? and second, to sum it up, it is a great Superhero film, a great heist action film, and even a great comedy. - 8.3<br/><br/>P.S. And remember there are TWO end credits scenes this time around, so remember to stay right to the very end."

Well after seeing this movie I can honestly say I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy. Paul Rudd did a great job of being a guy who is struggling in life and made some bad decisions even if they were for good intentions. He got the humour right and played the action right as well. Michael Douglas was well cast as Hank Pym and the story was really good from start to finish. The humour in this film was brilliant and done in the right areas of the film. The visuals are fantastic and the scenes where Paul Rudd is learning to become Ant Man as well as the fight scenes are top notch and when he shrinks to ant size you really do believe it is real. I thoroughly recommend seeing this film as it stands out well as it's own movie rather than a stepping stone to others. All Marvel fans and superhero fans need to see this.

","'All good things comes in small packages' 'It's not the quantity it's the quality' 'Never judge a book by its cover' - True say! <br/><br/>This little gem took me by surprise and I am glad I finally went and watched this movie as it was not on my priority list. It was released exactly a month ago, with very little hype. The only reason Ant Man caught my attention was because as an unlimited card holder I get to see trailers months before they are due to be released. Otherwise, I would have quite easily missed this film on the big screen. Why? I think because it was not hyped up enough.<br/><br/>Marvel Comics are well known for superheroes that have eye catching suits, skills and ability; they are huge and not just on their egos. They very rarely come singular, most times in pairs or in fours. They have weapons and very large,techy vehicles to wet the audience's appetite.<br/><br/>What does Ant-Man have? Well, he does have a suit that allows him to skilfully shrink in size whilst increasing his strength. He has a senseof humour only a naive thief will get. And that's where his 'jail friends' come in; there is something cute about men who are 'thick as 2 planks put together'. And as for the vehicle, well what could Ant- Man possibly have other than #247, the winged carpenter ant called 'Anthony ' and that's all is needed to 'make mountain out of a mole hill'.<br/><br/>Antastic! Fab performance by Paul Rudd as Ant-Man/Scott Lang. He had an innocent charm about him. I loved Michael Pena as Luis who just gave us something to laugh about every minute. Ant-Man was cleverly made;immersing you into the minute world beneath our feet, looking up it can be scary but the action just kept rolling in. I felt like a big kid-imagine Thomas the Tank engine magnified as you run ahead of it! The movie captured the imagination 100%. Ant-Man exceeded my expectations.

","Ant-Man is a slow and confused movie. Too relational. Too much time spent on relationships. There's the divorced father and divorced wife; the divorced husband and his young daughter; older husband and his dead wife, older father and his adult daughter, his adult daughter and the divorced husband. All this relational stuff took up half the film. The bad guy was predictable and obvious. Couldn't we just get to the ass-kicking of the bad guys? On the other hand, it's hard to kick ass when you're less than an eight of an inch tall. Oh, but you can sting the bad guys into submission. I like super powers and ultra-advanced technologies. Give me Cap America, Iron man and Thor anytime. Introducing Sam Wilson, The Falcon, was a weak and ineffectual reach to connect Ant Man to the Avenger heroes. The best special effect in the film was making Michael Douglas look thirty years younger. How did they do that?"

Like Man of Steel, which was a sci-fi alien invasion film masquerading as a comicbook movie and Winter Soldier which was political thriller, Ant-Man is a genre film, in fact it has more in common with an 80s or 90s heist movie than it does Avengers, and that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>The only complain I have is that certain elements dragged out for far too long, the movie could've been tighter.<br/><br/>Overall this is a solid 7/10 movie."

I personally got to see this in 4D, the 4D wasn't as good as ""Jurassic World"", but it really added to the overall experience. I will say I am very glad that Paul Rudd chose to be in this movie over ""Trainwreck"", he was just so darn likable compared to other superheroes. And Michael Douglas was the perfect choice for Hank Pym. He actually made way more of an appearance in this movie than I expected (which is a good thing). Evangeline Lilly is hot like always. Oh yeah and Michael Pena was also a good comedy relief. The action sequences was really fun to watch in this and executed almost flawlessly and that includes the transition from scene to scene as well. Maybe it's because I didn't have that high of an expectation for this movie, but it really beat my expectations in almost every level. Movies like this show that you don't need a budget of almost 200 million or beyond to make a good superhero movie that has powers.

","Ant-Man hits all the right notes. This is one of my favorite things about the MCU, they match the character to the genre. They're not trying to force them all into the same mold, which makes things more interesting when different characters come together. Iron Man - High tech action, Cap - WWII & Political Thriller Thor - High Fantasy, Guardians - Space Opera and now Ant-Man - Caper flick with an intimate family subplot.<br/><br/>For readers of the Scott Lang incarnation of Ant-Man, Paul Rudd brings him to life perfectly. He's just extremely likable as a regular guy thrust into extraordinary circumstances. As Ant-Man the film explores the full range of his powers with a great deal of imagination. Michael Douglas' Hank Pym is pretty much what I'd expect an aged Hank to be like. The parallel father/daughter relationship stories are very touching. Michael Pena is just hilarious, and you can tell Edgar Wright wrote most of this.<br/><br/>There are quite a few easter eggs for comic readers, and some hints of things to come. There are also some nice cameos and well drawn connections to the larger MCU.<br/><br/>It runs just under two hours and has two post credit scenes, both of which are awesome.<br/><br/>I saw it in IMAX 3D, and it was a very good conversion. The visual effects are just jaw dropping, including some genuinely fine work by the crew that did Chris Evans' pre-transformation look in Captain America:The First Avenger.<br/><br/>I really, really enjoyed this and I'm already looking forward to my second viewing."

Though this could have been good, it minimizes the impact of the action scenes and the overall weight of the threats etc. What was good was the cast : Michael Douglas is great as Hank Pym and does overshadow Paul Rudd who, when taken by himself, works as Scott Lang. A fantastic ""surprise"" at mid movie (the part the Marvel Zombies will prefer I think) and some cool moments help make this not a complete waste but, honestly, I was hoping for more.

"mjk280","5","13","33","27 July 2015"," The Oversaturation Is Real
","I was really looking forward to Ant Man. Paul Rudd was a good choice to take the Marvel formula in a more comical direction. As much as I like super heroes, the Marvel stuff is starting to wear on me. I don't like how hell bent they are on tying everything together and making sure to reference other franchises constantly. I knew Ant Man would eventually show up in an Avengers movie, but the casting of Rudd and the trailer signaled to me that this one would be somewhat off the board compared to what they've been doing everywhere else.<br/><br/>I was wrong unfortunately. The tone of this movie is exactly like every other Marvel flick. Somewhat jokey, never taking itself too seriously, but with a normal plot with high stakes involved. It just FELT like every other Marvel movie to date. I realize that's on purpose. They don't want to stray too far from what made the MU such a cash cow, but that's kinda the problem. Instead of letting Ant Man be its own thing, they made it ""Not Another Marvel Movie."" <br/><br/>Maybe the most unfortunate part is that I've seen better Marvel movies. There was nothing thrilling about Ant Man. The potential to get creative was pretty much entirely squandered aside from what you had already seen in the trailer. I mean come on. You have a guy that can shrink and go back to normal size at will, and all you can come up with is him mind-controlling an army of ants? It was such a letdown.<br/><br/>Rudd is good but they don't take advantage of him. RDJ had more quips in any single Marvel movie he's been in than Rudd does here. Why? This is why you hired the guy! Michael Douglas is fine as is everyone else. Corey Stoll is surprisingly decent as the villain, though they made his character a little too evil (selling to Hydra, who could basically be construed as Nazis? Come on). There's nothing wrong with the acting, it's just the writing and lack of flash that prevent this moving from being anything special.<br/><br/>When we first see Rudd transform to Ant Man, by accident no less, he's in the bath tub of his apartment and I was getting some great nostalgic flashbacks from being a kid and watching Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. I thought this would be a superhero version of that movie, having the same sort of premise. Unfortunately after that scene they don't do much creatively with Ant Man's abilities. He simply works with a bunch of ants to accomplish the end goal, and not much happens before that other than him training and a brief fight with Falcon (obviously shoe-horned in there to tie in with the Avengers). It's just lame, lazy, and as is customary with Marvel movies these days, it reeks of corporate interference. <br/><br/>They also introduce Wasp after the end credits. We need ANOTHER hero??? The last Avengers movie couldn't even give everyone enough screen time, now we're adding two more people? It's out of hand and downright absurd.<br/><br/>My overall impressions were that this movie was a victim of the strict schedule and format these movies (according to the studio) MUST take in order to maximize profitability. It's not about making the best movie possible anymore within the MU, it's about not going outside the box because it's a proved model. I'm sure millions will continue to eat this stuff up, but it's starting to become a broken record for me."

The story is solid and the acting ranging from mediocre to great, depending on the actor/actress. Being a bit of a science geek though, it bothered me when the Dr. Pym revealed the loss of his wife because there was a bit of a hole. If the shrinking device closes the distance between atoms, resulting in an ant-sized human with the same weight as a 200lb man, it would be impossible for one to shrink smaller than an atom, as clearly shown near the end when Scott shrinks smaller and smaller, past atoms into some freaky-effect dimension. In reality, he would have crossed the shwartzchild radii and turned into a black hole, and then abruptly exploded with the force of 10 Hiroshima bombs. Look up Kurzgesagt on YouTube on black holes if you want my source. Also, the Tank on the keychain would be too heavy to hold, precisely a 35.8 ton keychain.

One of the more unique additions to the MCU this throws out some good (if derivative) special effects and nifty action scenes, but it stays strictly within the confines of the origin tale formula making it difficult to shake an inherent feeling of déjà vu.

"CleveMan66","5","19","53","18 July 2015"," ""Ant-Man"" doesn't stand very tall compared to other Marvel superhero movies.
","Any movie adaptation intended to reach and entertain a wide audience, especially a movie adapted form a comic book series, needs to be able to stand on its own merits, and ""Ant-Man"" (PG-13, 1:57) does that. Still, a little background and perspective wouldn't hurt and that's what the first part of my reviews are for, so let's see if I can give you a little context for this movie before I set up its story.<br/><br/>The ""Ant-Man"" character first appeared in a January 1962 comic and was one of the five original ""Avengers"", but is only the fourth of them to get a solo film. (We've been watching Hulk, Iron Man and Thor movies for years and 2015 brings Ant-Man to the big screen, but there's no movie being planned for the character known as the Wasp.) ""Ant-Man"" is the sixth and final film in Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with a new Captain America movie kicking off Phase Three in May 2016. ""Ant-Man"" ties in with the MCU, but is meant to be more of a stand-alone film.<br/><br/>Wow. That only barely scratched the surface, but it's now time to talk more specifically about this film.<br/><br/>In the comics and in the film, Ant-Man is not about one person, but a series of people who wear the costume. Michael Douglas plays Hank Pym, the first Ant-Man, and the inventor of the so-called Pym Particle, which allows the wearer of his suit to shrink to the size of an insect by shrinking the space between molecules and using the resulting density to possess a strength very much out of proportion to his size. We see Pym resign from the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. when he discovers that their scientists are trying to replicate and militarize his formula, which he has come to believe presents more danger than benefit.<br/><br/>About 25 years later, Pym's protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), working with Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), is about to successfully recreate Pym's formula and Pym feels that he knows just the guy to help him prevent this. Pym tricks a very talented convicted burglar named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) into trying out the Ant-Man suit and convinces Lang to become the Ant-Man and help permanently derail Cross' plans. Pym explains that Lang's efforts will help him see more of his young daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson), whose mother (Judy Greer) and new husband (Bobby Cannavale) don't want him around until he gets back on his feet and becomes a more trustworthy father.<br/><br/>Lang soon finds out that being effective as the Ant-Man involves a lot more than just donning a special suit, pressing a button and becoming really, really small. He has to learn to fight better than he had to in prison, he has to learn how to fully harness the power of the suit and he has to learn how to communicate with different kinds of ants, which he can then use to help him get around and accomplish certain tasks. All this requires a lot of training and practice, as well as a little help from Lang's shady friends (played by Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and T.I.) And, of course, someone as greedy, power-hungry and unscrupulous as Darren Cross isn't going to take all this lying down. It's safe to assume that he has a few tricks up his well-tailored sleeves.<br/><br/>I can't say much more without giving away significant plot points, but I do want to offer a few points of interest which may seem random, but which at least MCU fans will appreciate. The first scene includes characters that have appeared in other MCU films, with both aging make-up and CGI de-aging of various actors for the sake of continuity. One of the Avengers makes what you might call a guest appearance in the middle of the movie and again late in the movie. Don't stress yourself out throughout the movie looking for the traditional MCU Stan Lee cameo because it comes very late in the film. Lastly, there are two short additional scenes, one mid-credits and one post-credits, which set up possible future story lines for the characters in this movie.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is different from other MCU movies, but not for the better. The CGI during the shrinking scenes is very good, but not the best that MCU has shown us in the other films and, because of the nature of the story, there's less of a need for the more spectacular visual effects to which MCU fans have become accustomed. This allows more focus on the story and character development, but the lackluster script still fails to create adequate tension or make us care much for the characters. ""Ant-Man"" gets points for originality and good pacing, but is relatively unimpressive. ""B-"""

","Now I'm not too sure if the Marvel bandwagon is suffering from dodgy wheels here but after watching this with my 12 year old daughter I think maybe a few of the Marvel fans may be thinking that this could be the start of a weak link in the chain. Great movie yes,,very family orientated and the special effects while at times both excellent but occasionally a bit tepid do not override the storytelling. Some good laugh out loud moments and hugely enjoyable with a well written script it keeps the audience happy. The only problem is maybe Marvel are pushing out too much stuff and it could start to get a bit overdone. Lots of references to other Marvel heroes started to make me feel as though we were being taken just a little for granted and left just a tiny hint of a slightly bad taste. The ending definitely says sequel and you just know he is going to join the Avengers which made this film feel as though it was just an advert for the whole Marvel bandwagon. It should have been a stand alone film with it's own back drop and ideas. Having said that the audience all loved it(including myself) but I get the nagging feeling this might just be a bit too much too soon. The money taken at the box office for the Marvel movies could and should be used for proper independent movie making and up and coming directors. Little bit of a rant there but I'm sure you can see what I mean when you've seen it."

I didn't find Ant-Man funny; it was formula stuff; I've seen it all before; just think 'Antz' (1998) with an ordinary guy (like Spiderman or Captain America) who gets a suit that can shrink him to a minuscule size who commands insects and saves the world. Ant-Man was clever, but it presumed the audience was familiar with 'The Avengers' and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. Other audience members seemed to enjoy it; maybe I wasn't in the mood."

","Speaking of the ability to shrink to ground level, Marvel's done the same thing with their ""Universe."" While some aspects were fun, the acting on par and they included two of my favorite Micheals: Mr. Peña and Mr. Douglas, Ant-Man was worth a watch for MCU fansat home.<br/><br/>So many scenes were dry and drawn out. Since the movie is A-B-C to the letter and it hardly elevated from the bottom of the MCU films, those scenes were tough to get through. I understand this is yet another origin story, but with a little more editing and much more Ant-Man himself, this could've been much more entertaining. <br/><br/>Still, it's worth a watch on your home screen once it's available in a couple of months. That way, you can fast-forward through the incredibly long credits to see the post-post credit scene (yeah, there were two, neither worth waiting for,) and not have to be bored to tears waiting for a useless scene. (I even brought my phone out during the credits and played some games as I needlessly waited.) I hate Marvel for those scenes. Hopefully DC won't mimic them."

","How can you do a really good movie about a man who transforms into a little man? How do you make it accessible to people who are not aware of the comic world, but also keep it real with the fans of the Marvel Universe? Well Marvel seems to have all the right answers to that. Generally speaking that is, because as always, there will be people who might not like this at all.<br/><br/>But the acting in this, is superb! Getting Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd in the two main roles is genius. Also Evangeline Lilly, who is not Lost anymore. The comedy timing, the story telling, the little things that make this movie work, are all elevating it to an experience you can have, that is a fun ride. Something movies should be, if they are aiming for it.<br/><br/>Because this is not meant to solve world problems, this is not meant to be a heavy drama, this is meant to be what it is. And by those ""rules"", it expands the Marvel Universe ... can't wait to see what's coming up next (Phase 3 has started)"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","5","15 May 2016"," An All Around Very Good Movie
","Ant-Man (2015)<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and plans on going straight but that doesn't go as planned but he's recruited by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to try out a suit that manages to shrink his size while making him even stronger. Soon Ant-Man has to try and stop a bad guy (Corey Stoll) trying to sell the secret.<br/><br/>ANT-MAN is a film that really took me by surprise. I'm not a comic book person so I wasn't familiar with this character or the story. I was really shocked at how entertaining the personal drama was as well as how exciting the action was. When I first saw the trailer I couldn't help but think of HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS and this film actually benefits from the same thing that movie did and that's the rather cool effect of being small and surrounded by large, everyday items.<br/><br/>This is certainly one aspect that makes the film so entertaining because the entire idea of someone being able to shrink and then go back to their regular size in the matter of seconds is just fun. Even more fun is the way he is trained into becoming this warrior because it not only adds some great action scenes but also some very good laughs. You've got the action and the laughs but I thought the film also sold the personal drama that the main characters have.<br/><br/>A lot of credit has to go to the cast for pulling this off. Rudd is as perfect as Ant-Man as Robert Downey, Jr. is as Iron Man. The casting was simply perfect because Rudd can perfectly handle the drama, the comedy and the action and he makes for a complete character. Douglas also adds a lot to the film in his supporting role as does Stoll as the villain. Michael Pena and Bobby Cannnavale are both good in their supporting bits as is Evangeline Lilly in her role.<br/><br/>ANT-MAN also benefits from clocking in under two hours as the film never seems too long. The story isn't dragged on and instead we're given non-stop action and fun. There have been many good movies made from Marvel comics but ANT-MAN is certainly among the best."
"cubsckc","8","9","23","31 July 2015"," Surprisingly Done Well... but...
","I'll tell you what, the first time I saw this movie in trailers, I expected it to completely fail. A dude in an Ant custom that can shrink and kick people's butts? Sounds a bit stupid. The good thing though is that the film was able to focus on the different parties involved in the movie's plot. What helped the film a lot was the infiltration part that of the Ant Man, that for me at least demonstrated his biggest strength. I hope you guys like my review, and appreciate what I like and am worried about in future Marvel Films which include Ant Man. <br/><br/>You have this guy who is a criminal and given a second chance in life due to his skills which are tested by the older Ant Man. Of course, the older guy is basically retired and has a daughter while at the same time having his apprentice turn against him and take away his company and weapons to sell to hydra. Though the main conflict was the fact that Hydra was about to get this new Ant Man weaponry, they were briefly shown and mentioned. Which I think was a good thing, because it gives Ant Man its own spirit as a film. One is drawn to the characters because you see their loses and what they are fighting for. The new Ant Man for example has a daughter and a second chance to live up to, while the older Ant Man and his daughter have a way of rekindling their relationship over the very thing that broke them apart. <br/><br/>All in all, great film. Its hard not to like the characters and the plot. What I did have a problem with was the scene were Ant Man gets into a fight with Falcon from the new Avengers. The fight was kind of stupid and what I was afraid the whole movie was going to be about. I appreciate this film as a separate identity from the rest of Marvel. Are we going to see this dude fighting powerful and almost immortal beings when we get into the rest of the Marvel Universe? It is a bit worrying because the first Avengers was very different from the second in the sense that it worked a bit better."

","A simple(-minded) concept transfigured to better fit the Militainment Mold of Modern Marvel, ANT-MAN ain't, man. What it is, is this: ""America's politics would now be also America's favorite movie,"" to quote the late Norman Mailer (see THE PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS). From STAR WARS to ANT-MAN and beyond, the studios are milking the Mindless Masses for all they're worth; doing their part, as it were, to further the Military Entertainment Complex. Americans, as Mailer points out in CANNIBALS AND CHRISTIANS, are ""eager to slay."" What better way to slay than to play- to live vicariously through soul-deadening video games and, now, movies that offer little more than more of the same? ""Patriotism,"" Mailer pointed out, ""was a football game."" And: ""Wars shift from carnage and patriotism to carnage and surrealism..."" The worst offense of all: ANT-MAN trots out the likes of ""Michael Douglas,"" as if in so doing it'll add something to the movie. It doesn't."
"sonofhades","5","4","8","25 December 2016"," Paul Rudd saves otherwise perfectly average B-movie
","I'll grant it from the start that Ant-Man is not my first choice for a superhero movie. Apart from Aquaman and The Wall, it was the stupidest thing one could think for a superhero. <br/><br/>As it stands, I watched the movie mostly because my wife is a fan of Paul. So far every other movie he has starred in has been my cup of tea. Unfortunately this one is not. <br/><br/>I'll give the movie a few credits. It had some humor effects that caused my to actually laugh out loud (instead of merely stating lol aloud) and some of the special effects used in the movie were decent enough. It also gave tidbits of information about ants. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the storyline was awkward. Granted, the original concept wasn't much better either so I'd guess the screenwriters had to do with the concept of ... sigh ... Ant-Man to begin with. The shrinking / growing up suit mumbo-jumbo is ridiculous from the start, but I expected it and was able to get past that.<br/><br/>It was just that the plot had enough holes in it that were fit for a truck to drive through. I actually laughed most when the sidekick character was worried about the well-being of a security guard he had knocked out earlier and dragged him off the building before it explodes, but paid no attention to the two guys he just knocked out. <br/><br/>Of course, a few days is always enough time to teach a man to fight martial arts well enough to beat dozens of people. I attended Karate for two years and probably could not hurt a fly with my moves. <br/><br/>The villain was a stereotypical bad guy with less depth than the world's shortest book (Swedish military victories since 18th century). Much like any of the bad guys in the very bad Steven Seagal / Chuck Norris / Van Damme movies I've watched in my youth (forgive me, I did not know better). In addition, in this movie he is stupid enough to aim for the super suit that will change everything when he already has a gun that can instantly remove any person from the face of the earth, leaving hardly any evidence of his/her existence behind. No, none of the powers in the world would pay any money for such weapon. Sigh. Supersuit has to have lasers that copy the sound world of imperial troopers.<br/><br/>The idea of shrinking has been dealt in movies such as Innerspace or Honey, I Shrunk the Kids back in the 80s and truth be told, while the effects are slightly better these days, the story of a good movie requires more than a guy who can instantly change his size and use his fists to beat people up. <br/><br/>Truth be told, superhero movies follow the same pattern. It would be more interesting to watch a movie about guys who have to clean up after the superheroes and villains have fought. They have to pick up the pieces, clean the neighborhood and rebuild everything. Only to start from scratch the next time the good/bad guys decide to have a go at each other.<br/><br/>That said. Paul Rudd plays his character decent enough where Michael Douglas and the rest of the cast show up just to collect their paychecks and fail to deliver anything resembling any sort of realistic emotion or character behavior. If you like the guy, you might check this movie out. If not, there's better things to do for the next 2 hours of your life."

","Ant Man is baffling experience even at Marvel's universe. It tries to be as a super hero movie at the same time it is actually a anti hero movie. Marvel has manage to convert many comic books to satisfy movies recently. Ant-Man is not one of the best unfortunately. To me Ant-Man is all new experience and that might be a one reason for me not to be all pleased. Movie has made with quality, but somehow it leaves you cold. It feels like it has tried to make almost too perfect and it leaves no personality to director. It looks good but feels empty. Like some of the worst Spider Man movies. Movie doesn't offer any particular reason to pay full price of a movie ticket. It actually feels B-class Marvel movie and it would be probably best as a television series than silver screen. So if you have even a decent home theatre at home it is best to wait BluRay release. At least then you can pause it as many times as you wish."
"XweAponX","10","6","14","13 November 2015"," ""It's Not a Keychain!""
","""Ant Man"" has been one of my favorite Avengers, even in his other personae ""Giant Man"", ""Wasp"" and ""YellowJacket"". But this version of ""Ant-Man"" is not the same Ant-Man from the comics I read. That version was Dr. Henry Pym, who with his wife Janet van Dyne aka ""Wasp"" (Another version of Wasp), were part of the Avengers, maybe sometimes part of The Defenders, a short lived comic series that included members of The Avengers as well as Dr Strange. What is not told in any of The Avengers movies or even this movie, is that Hank Pym was the scientist who created Ultron- The films have Tony Stark doing it.<br/><br/>This film is based on one of the side stories, where a burglar named Scott Lang steals Ant-Man's suit, but ends up using it to defeat a crook named Darren Cross. That's mainly the story told here. But Hank Pym is a large part of it, in this rendition his daughter ""Hope"" (Evangeline Lilly) partially taking the place of the character of Janet van Dyne.<br/><br/>This film focuses more on the Scott Lang story, an ex crook who works with a couple of burglars and a computer hacker. He can't even keep a job at Baskin-Robbins, because ""Baskin-Robbin's always finds out"".<br/><br/>So he is forced to take a job with his burglar roommates. But it turns out to be a set-up, set up by Dr Pym himself. So, all Lang finds is a cool looking Motorcycle Riding outfit. Fun things happen when he puts it on.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Darren Cross, Dr Pym's ex-protégé, responsible for Pym's loss of his company, has been trying to figure out the ""Pym Particle"" which is the basis of Ant-man's suit... Because he wants to sell it to some creepy looking guy. Pym knows that would be bad, so he wants to Sabotage that sale. But can he talk Lang into helping him, and will he be able to do it?<br/><br/>One of the things from the comics that translated into the movie was Pym's Helmet, which he uses to talk to Ants and Bugs.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pretty pleased with how this film came out- A lot of the things in it came straight from the comics, including the concept of what would happen if the suit-wearer went ""Subatomic"". But I mainly liked how this story takes the original Ant-Man and hands it off to the ""new guy"" (And his Daughter, but that's for a sequel). And once again, an i-Phone is used in a major gag - Watch for it."

I was actually sitting impressed rather than let down at the end of the film and glad that I took the time to watch it, nicely done.<br/><br/>If you're a Marvel fan I believe you'd enjoy the humor in this one, after all it does have some great comics throughout the action.

The story is so superbly balanced, touching upon all the right issues of the super heroes universe, adding just the right amount of melodrama and always countering it with a well placed joke when it's about to become too sappy or too preachy. The acting is brilliant - It's the second time ever that I liked a role played by Michael Douglas (Falling Down was the 1st). Paul Rudd is just perfect for his role, and as he participated in the script writing, he must be responsible for some of his own jokes (and they do seem his own). And everybody else is a perfect fit, so kudos to the casting director. And when everything is working together so well, the director himself must have a hand in and he does. I know very little of Peyton Reed, but I'll be paying attention from now on."
"diac228","9","6","14","10 August 2015"," Ant-Man is a surprisingly entertaining romp with a stellar script and stellar cast
","In the midst of all the behind-the-scenes chaos, what we see here is quite possibly Marvel's best film since the original Iron Man. Containing the extremely-loose approach of the Phase 1 Marvel flicks, the delightful quirks and details from Edgar Wright's script, and the carefree fun of Paul Rudd (Role Models) and Adam McKay (Will Ferrell's best work), Ant-Man is comic book brilliance that substitutes style for wonderful characters and plenty of content to chew at. Of course let's not forget the slew of Marvel surprises that we honestly didn't see enough of in Age of Ultron. Thanks to the strict organized approach from Disney, it is safe to say that Marvel is still leagues ahead of the competition in terms of comic book and summer blockbuster films.<br/><br/>The staff is incredible, and must have made the director's job quite easy. Starting with the always-reliable Paul Rudd and the silently-efficient Evangeline Lilly, we have an excellent entourage bringing what is a relatively unknown comic book to life. Rounding out the staff is the very serious and engaging Michael Douglas, an unexpected addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The themes presented in Ant-Man are a bit more personal than your usual blockbuster fare, with plots involving redemption, forgiveness, and father/sibling relationships all blending in together---and this requires better performances from even your villains. From our villain (Corey Stoll bringing some depth to our mad scientist) to our father figure right down to the partner-in-crime (Michael Pena, also excellent) Ant-Man boasts one of the strongest lineups in all of 2015. Honestly though, what's with Disney and fathers? <br/><br/>Usually creative differences from the writing squadron in the midst of filming will result in mixed content throughout the finished product. Disney's very own Brave is one of the better recent examples, with the first and second half of the movie being extremely different in tone, pace, and even character. Quite miraculously, you don't get this sensation in Ant-Man, from the first act origin story right down to the exciting climax that delivers enough action to cover the extensive prologue. It has obvious touches of Edgar Wright's quick-paced humor and character depth, but has Rudd's clever subtle comic timing and McKay's humorous mayhem. A four-team staff complied the script, and what could have been a disaster actually results in a complete screenplay with a little bit of everything: humor, heart, action, and tons of connections to other Marvel properties.<br/><br/>Peyton Reed has a resume that could raise some eyebrows (sneaky-fun Bring it On, could-be-better Yes Man), but doesn't disappoint here. Although he has far less action to work with, he manages to keep Ant-Man fun, grounded, and simple. It has its share of emotion, but it never drags too far or mucks up the blockbuster glee. He treats it like a heist film, with unique circumstances. Under the hook/line/sinker approach, the biggest sequence is saved for last and will keep you on your toes, while also laughing along the way thanks to the sprinkles of humor flung in for good measure.<br/><br/>Similar to the equally-unique Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man is enjoyable because it never feels like its holding back any punches to save for the next (obviously going to happen) installment. Unlike Age of Ultron and Thor: The Dark World, it feels like a complete story, and will keep you asking for more---especially after the post-credits sequences. It fires on all cylinders with the permission of Marvel and the Disney Marketing Machine, and despite not having the previous popularity credentials of a Batman or a Spider-Man, Ant-Man leaves a nice footprint in the cinematic comic book universe. Don't let the slightly campy outlook of Ant-Man fool you, this is a seriously entertaining picture worth a thousand words of praise."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","6","14","9 August 2015"," Far more fun than expected, ""Ant-Man"" is an easy Marvel hero to root for
","In the midst of ""The Avengers"" and the countless other successful films that Marvel Studios has turned into the mega-franchise of the last decade, ""Ant-Man"" has never felt like a priority. It has taken the studio ages to figure out how Ant-Man, who originated as a founding member of the Avengers in the comics, would fit into their multi-billion dollar machine, and now that they slipped him in, he just might be the most interesting weapon in their arsenal.<br/><br/>Although this is the first ""Ant-Man,"" the film feels far from an origin story, partly in the clever way that the story involves two ""ant-men,"" Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Marvel movie fans are asked to believe Pym was merely an unmentioned part of S.H.I.E.L.D. for decades, but regardless, Pym hand-picking and training his successor is a new dynamic for a superhero film.<br/><br/>Lang is a burglar with a background in electronic engineering, and unlike his major Avengers contemporaries, he's a family man too, albeit his daughter lives with his ex-wife. Fresh out of prison for stealing millions from a crooked organization, Lang gets pulled into a new job by his buddy Luis (Michael Peña), which leads him to Pym and the Ant-Man suit. Pym is in need of someone with Lang's skills to infiltrate his former company, now run by his ruthless former protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who is on the verge of a breakthrough in his attempts to replicate Pym's shrinking technology.<br/><br/>If ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was Marvel Studios' take on a spy movie, then ""Ant- Man"" is its heist film. Although the break-in to destroy Cross' data and yellow jacket suit isn't the sole focus of the movie, it's the highlight in a film that ends up being way more fun than even the most optimistic Marvel fan would've imagined.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" has two tricks up its sleeve that prevent it from basically being an ""Iron Man"" knock- off: a hero who can change his size instantly and a loyal army of ants. The size factor creates infinite creative action sequence possibilities, which is nothing to brush off considering how many times audiences have seen a man in a suit fighting bad guys in the last 20 years. The ant factor is also easy to underestimate, but they add such unique flavor to movie and are integral to the plot.<br/><br/>No fan would ask for Marvel to pick the director of ""Bring It On"" to bring Ant-Man to life, especially when that man (Peyton Reed) was stepping in for geek-revered auteur Edgar Wright, but it's clear by how clever ""Ant-Man"" is that Wright's story and screenplay work were still influential. With a screenplay from Wright and Joe Cornish revised by Rudd and modern comedy writer/director Adam McKay (""Anchorman""), it's amazing that ""Ant-Man"" is a cohesive, exciting action film that's also funny, rather than just ending up plain silly.<br/><br/>There is a definite limit to the praise that can be heaped onto ""Ant-Man,"" particularly as it relates to its conventional plot and a few bland characters, but it absolute hits the mark on the entertainment factor in a way no Marvel film has since the original ""Avengers"" (outside of ""Guardians of the Galaxy""). The humor definitely helps, and one prime example of its keen use is when Lang asks Pym why he doesn't just get the Avengers to do the job. That little bit of self- awareness is good for the tone and rewarding to fans of Marvel films. A scene in which Ant-Man takes on one of the Avengers, though superfluous for the film, is a delightful bridge to the greater universe and serves to put more points in the entertainment column. The tie-ins don't hinder the film as much as you might expect; Marvel Studios definitely strikes a balance between the ingenuity of Wright's original concept for this movie and its overbearing necessity to be part of a ""phase"" of superhero films with bigger objectives.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is a welcome member to the Marvel movie family and he might just even steal some votes as a fan favorite Avenger over time. It's too bad Marvel doesn't plan to let him fly solo again between now and the final two-part ""Avengers: Infinity War"" in 2018-19, but hopefully the reaction to this first installment will change their minds, or maybe they've got bigger plans for their tiniest hero than we realize.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

Instead of it being your typical ""We need to save the world"" movie, it's a heist movie, which is perfect for the character in question. It really makes the movie a lot smaller than other recent MCU films, and almost gave it the same vibe as the first Iron Man (though not as good).<br/><br/>Paul Rudd as Ant-Man was perfect. He had great comedic moments, and you actually felt for his character when he is talking to his daughter. Michael Pena was by far the funniest part of the movie. He will be the character you quote when talking about the film and him and Rudd work great together.<br/><br/>The relationship between Evangeline Lily's character and Michael Douglas's was fantastic, as it goes from a daughter who despises her father to a great relationship. Michael Douglas was perfect as Hank Pym, I can't think of anybody else who could have portrayed the character better.<br/><br/>The villain in the movie, played by Corey Stoll, continues on the trend of Marvel's forgettable villains. He was your typically evil guy doing evil things with other evil people because he's evil. He is probably the weakest part of the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes were stunning in this film, and are probably the best part about the movie.

Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant man was so ingenious, the guys hilarious and I think he will no longer be underestimated as a leading action hero. Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly as a said before were both great but there's one more that comes to mind that might be overlooked by people who haven't seen this movie and that would be Michael Pena, this guy provided non stop laughs throughout the whole movie, it was a genius move to cast him, bravo.<br/><br/>I know this review really doesn't give much insight to the heart of the film but I implore you to just go watch it, it's such a different and fresh marvel movie or any comic book movie for that matter, I guarantee you'll have a lot of fun with it. Ant Man follows in guardians of the galaxy's footsteps being that it's not an extremely popular marvel title that's been transformed into a thrilling cinematic experience and I think you'll really dig it."

","As a latecomer to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I had heard a lot of negative opinions about Paul Rudd and Ant-Man. A few of the preceding instalments in the series (namely Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron) were quite frankly bad films, with very weak plot lines and very sloppy writing. This was much better. I love how these Marvel films experiment in crossing the boundaries between genres. In Ant-Man, we see your typical superhero origins story coupled with a classic heist movie. And for perhaps the first time in the MCU, our title character and hero is a down on his luck, ordinary (and relatable) guy just trying to hold down a normal job and maybe get to see his daughter at weekends. Our antagonist of Darren Cross (AKA Yellowjacket) is also a breath of fresh air, as his motives stem from a want of power and wealth - again more relatable than the Marvel accustomed seemingly groundless want for global destruction and genocide (think Aldrich Killian/The Mandarin, Malekith, Ultron etc). Overall I look forward to seeing more of Paul Rudd as the MCU progresses, right back on track."

"davidmvining","5","1","1","25 November 2019"," Obviously the product of a tortured production
","His movie is intentionally light in contrast to the large movies that precede it. I think it's a good idea overall to vary a franchise's output in tone, scale, and even genre, but Ant-Man specifically doesn't really work.<br/><br/>The problem is the fact that the main character has no real stake in the central conflict of the story. Scott Lang is an ex-con just released from prison for burglary who wants to go straight in order to be a good father to his little girl. After getting fired from Baskin Robbins because of his criminal past, he joins up with some other ex-cons to pull a small heist. He breaks into an old man's house, gets past both high tech and low tech security and walks away with a suit that he finds out later makes him the size of an ant. After some back and forth in prison, the old man, Hank Pym, recruits Lang to steal some technology from the company that Pym founded by had been kicked out of some decades before.<br/><br/>And that's the actual conflict at the heart of the movie. It's between Pym and Darren Cross, the current CEO of Pym's company. Cross is recreating the Pym Particle, the techno-babble nonsense that makes the shrinking possible, a technology that Pym had created many years prior and tried to bury because of its potential implications and uses. Pym doesn't want Cross to get the technology because he sees in Cross some unstable elements, and he's right of course.<br/><br/>What does Lang have to do with this fight? He's essentially a mercenary and never has any stake in the central fight itself. He gets roped in because of his need for money and Pym's desire to use his thieving skills (as well as his desire to protect his daughter Hope, who is also in on the plan), but he doesn't have the right level of interest to be the protagonist in this specific story. That's entirely Hank Pym. Pym is the protagonist, but he's built into the story as a secondary character. It creates a weird dynamic within the fabric of the narrative.<br/><br/>On top of that, the movie's structurally odd. The entire second act is essentially one long training montage, and it drags. It's entertaining in spots, but ultimately it barely moves the story forward in any significant way. It's Lang sort of amusingly learning his skills while we get massive amounts of exposition about rules of the world, especially rules around ants.<br/><br/>And yet, the movie has some entertainment. Paul Rudd is winning as Lang, and his thieving cohorts (led by Michael Pena) are amusing. The two times that Pena tells stories (the first to introduce the heist and the second the end the film and set up a bit in Captain America: Civil War), the editing becomes almost frantic in order to keep up with Pena's quick mouth. They're easily the most enjoyable moments of the film. It makes you wish the rest of the film had been told with a similar energy. The special effects are amusing and different. The juxtaposition of things like a toy Thomas the Tank Engine feeling threatening is enjoyable.<br/><br/>However, the story overall is so poorly assembled with a main character that's not actually the protagonist, a below average antagonist, and a dragging second act, that I simply cannot find the fun in the work as a whole."

Ant-Man was not at all what I expected. I have been a fan of most of the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic universe, . it has good story and time line with ultron and holds your interest throughout. There are plenty of action and the fight scenes, but unlike the previous Marvel movies, this movie focuses on a heist. This, along with the comedy throughout, makes it a breath of fresh air in the Marvel universe. No Marvel movie since has so seamlessly bonded the genre of action and comedy. And when looking for Howard's stark facility the for the stuff that controls the machine for the particle is on avengers soil this is fun when ant man encounters falcon because he breached security
Scot lange played Paul rudd shows a vulnerable side
The main character, Scott Lange, is not a billionaire or scientist or ancient god, and he doesn't have super strength or intelligence; he is a thief who deals with holding down a job or not but when a job comes along he finds something or kinda faith plays a part in a job he stumbles upon that might save his life in San Francisco and her earns to be able to see his daughter. This makes him incredibly relatable. Being played by Paul Rudd doesn't hurt either. Rudd, along with the rest of the cast, delivers a memorable performance. The idea of a father trying to reconcile his relationship with his daughter may have been used before, but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas make it work without seeming trite or overused. The role that really stands out is Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket. He is, in my opinion, the most terrifying villain the Marvel universe has seen yet. He doesn't want global domination, he wants money and power, and that makes him a very believable villain. Stoll's performance is more three-dimensional than one might expect in a super hero movie, and adds to the already great cast. 8/10"

","This is the very first Marvel Cinematic Universe movie that I saw and I love it!!
Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a non-violent and very likeable crook who is just being released from prison and decides that he wants to start over to provide for his little girl. But he is unable to hold down a job. He is offered a job - to break into a safe in an old man's house. But he finds nothing in the safe except for a strange suit. He goes home and tries it on - and winds up getting involved in a breaking-in job to save the world.
(Again, I apologise about the bad movie synopsis).
Paul Rudd is great as Lang. He is charming and hilarious. Though, I have one qualm with Lang's character - he tends to spoil some truly great or emotional scenes.
Michael Douglas is amazing as Hank Pym. The calm, straightforward man who hires Lang, Douglas really brings him to life.
Loved the way they handled the budding romance in this and there is some well-done character development.
The shrinking technology was fun and sometimes hilarious to watch - particularly in the climax.
Some have called this 'weird' or 'odd'. While I can understand why they think this way, I don't think it is. It's science fiction and great fun to watch. Great fun and really engaging. Loved Luis and his storytelling scenes. It's cheesy, but a fun cheesy. At first I really wanted more scenes where he is telling a story, but then realised that it would soon get old and his scenes wouldn't have the same charm. Luis really steals all the scenes he's in.
A definite recommend."

How did they mess up letting Evangeline Lilly do what she does best - good, heartfelt, emotive performances? There was no chemistry with any of the relationships (except maybe with Ant-tony). The villain was mundane and barely threatening. Otherwise, the CGI was creative and dynamic, the potential of the bare bones premises are still there. It just fell flat for me.

As a matter of fact, he has been so successful that he is even considering using his research on humans. And the one thing he doesn't want is for his project to fall into the wrong hands. So in order to prevent that he has kept the most important research strictly to himself. What he doesn't count on, however, is his devious assistant ""Darren Cross"" (Corey Stoll) maneuvering behind his back and taking over the corporation and continuing with the same research with a goal to sell this technology to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, another man named ""Scott Lang"" (Paul Rudd) has just gotten out of prison and is trying to make a new life for himself. Unfortunately, few places want to hire a former convict and in a moment of desperation he is convinced by some friends to break into the home of a wealthy man and steal all the money and jewels from the safe. But upon finally cracking the safe all Scott finds is a strange uniform and nothing else of any value. Realizing that this is rather odd Scott eventually puts on the uniform and discovers that his body has shrunk to an incredibly small size and that there are dangers all around him because of it. It's at this time that he hears a voice in his helmet which advises him on what to do next. What he doesn't know is that the voice belongs to Hank Pym and that he has been chosen for an assignment of incredible proportions. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good ""comic book"" movie which contained a good mixture of both action and comedy. Admittedly, the ending was somewhat predictable but even so it still remained quite entertaining and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

","After three years in prison cat burglar Scott Lang finds it difficult to find work so soon gets involved in a robbery. His criminal contacts have learnt about an old man with a massive safe in his basement they don't know what it contains but given the security it must be valuable. He is rather surprised to discover that all it contains is what looks like an old biker-suit. He takes it and tries it on later suddenly he shrinks to the size of an ant! It turns out the suit's owner, Dr Hank Pym, intended for him to steal it he wants somebody who is a skilled burglar to use the suit for a very specific job. Initially Scott isn't interested but inevitably he is soon pulled in. Hank explains how the suit works and tells Scott that he is worried because his former protégé Darren Cross has replicated the technology and intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Scott won't be working alone; he will have support from Hank, his daughter Hope, his three criminal friends and lots of ants it turns out Dr Pym has developed technology that enables ants to be telepathically controlled! Ultimately Scott, in his Ant-Man suit will have to face Cross who is wearing his fully armed 'Yellowjacket' suit.<br/><br/>Not being a comic reader I wasn't familiar with Ant-Man before this film came out but when heard about it I thought the premise sounded rather fun and so it is. There are some humorous moments, mostly provided by Scott's criminal friends; these are fun and don't detract from the story. Scott/Ant-Man is a good protagonist as he isn't a typical superhero; he has no natural superpowers and the technology he uses wasn't invented by himself. Paul Rudd does a fine job in the role and is ably supported by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly as Dr Pym and Hope. Corey Stoll is suitably menacing as Cross and Michael Peña, Tip ""T.I."" Harris and David Dastmalchian are fun as Scott's criminal friends. The special effects are very impressive making it easy to suspend ones disbelief and accept that Ant-Man can change size and interact with actual ants. I liked the fact that while it is made clear that this film takes place in the same reality as other Marvell superhero films it doesn't guest star any other well-known superheroes just one less well known one in a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates an Avengers facility to steal a needed piece of equipment.

He then uses said suit to go on a heist to retrieve some important technology from a maniac. The film is set in the same universe as the Avengers films and contains some clumsily shoehorned-in references to the franchise.<br/><br/>It's a simple enough conceit, but one which zings with humour and features endlessly great CGI action sequences which really push the boundaries and show off techniques and effects that haven't been done before. It was a lot of fun seeing ants playing the good guys in a similar way to HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS. The heist plot is nothing special but there's enough ensemble acting and humour to see it through.

The film does an excellent job of mixing comedy and action. The gem of the film is the final battle, it is one of the best fight scenes I have seen from hero films in a while, excluding the Civil War airport fight. However the film isn't perfect. The villain is underdeveloped. T.I. is in this film and his acting drags on you. The lady playing the future Wasp is a blank slate, nearly robotic. And some of the ant CGI is outright awful.

","This movie made me realize that we've seen too many superhero films in the last few years and sadly, it looks like thats the plan for the next 5 years too. The film made me realize a few problems that Marvel movies have. First, they try to tie in all movies into the marvel universe. Now a passing sentence or a clever remark are good, they don't detract from the whole movie and pot but here, the plot is sidelined to make space for a fight between a pre existing superhero and the films protagonist. Plotwise, that scene meant nothing and it detracted from the villain that then feels less important. Marvel has a villain problem, they aren't relatable and are very much like bond villains, very similar to each other (movie to movie), always have the same powers as the hero and always die at the end. Lastly, female characters are vastly underutilized to the extent that the plot doesn't make sense. In this film, Hope is the perfect person to use that suit but is put on the sidelines for Scott Lang. Of course this movie isn't all bad, its pretty funny and the performances are good (somewhat too comedic for me), the cgi is breathtaking at times and i really wanted to see more of Scott's discovery of the miniature world. The movie really does suffer from the whole marvel movie universe and has the same feel to it and ends up very bland."

My expectations were met.<br/><br/>I collect silver age comics including Tales to Astonish 1 through 101. Henry Pym's first appearance was in Marvel comics' Tales to Astonish #27 in a story entitled ""The Man in the Ant Hill."" I'm very familiar with the original Ant-Man, Henry Pym (played by Michael Douglas) in the film, but I'm unfamiliar with the modernized Ant-Man played by Paul Rudd. This is not a movie for silver age comic book collectors, but it's a good movie for families with young kids.<br/><br/>The movie has a good amount of comic relief. Even the Avengers movies include comedic moments, but Ant-Man has a continuous comedic undertone. That said, there are no hilarious scenes in the movie. As for the action, my wife, who religiously watches superhero movies with me and who loves the Avengers, Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, slept through half of Ant-Man.<br/><br/>This movie rates well below Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, but is above Ang Lee's Hulk and both Fantastic Four movies.

"Robert_duder","6","6","15","10 August 2015"," The weakest of the Marvel Franchise but hear me out
","I remember a long time ago when they first released ""leaked"" footage of Ant-Man screen tests or something like that. It was a poor quality video of ""Ant-Man"" kicking some guys butts. I thought it was a joke. Marvel had finally hit rock bottom. This would finally be the film that broke their incredibly impressive streak. I have always said that certain Superheroes simply do not translate well to live action. However, I suppose if anyone can do it, it would be Marvel/Disney who have single handedly changed the face of Cinema over the last decade with their Superhero Universe they have created. Did they need Ant-Man? No. Should they have done it? Not in my opinion. However, its not a total wash. Ant-Man was indeed okay and I'm impressed that they were able to pull off even ""okay."" I think this should have been made into a film geared towards a younger crowd. Start a ""Marvel Kids"" Universe. It would have worked much better because the entire concept of Ant-Man looks ludicrous. Although its also one of the most impressive parts of the film is that it relies so heavily on ""perspective"" special effects, meaning how the world looks from Ant-Man's view when he is super-small.<br/><br/>One thing Marvel has done to near perfection is casting for its Superhero Universe. The cast for Ant-Man is very good but when the plot and concept is so implausible its hard for even the best actors to bring it to life. Paul Rudd struggles (in my opinion) to find the right vibe for this character. His characteristic humour and sarcasm seems almost forced and I'm not sure he fits the role well. I'm not saying he wouldn't make a great Superhero but I'm not sure this script was right for him. One of my all time favourite actors, the legendary Michael Douglas plays Hank Pym, the creator of the Ant-Man suit. Douglas is very good in the role, adds intensity and emotion to the role and probably gets more depth than any other character. I expected him to have a small supporting role and he is actually a main character which was a pleasant surprise. Evangeline Lilly is also good as Douglas' daughter Hope. The romance between her and Rudd is sort of forced and their chemistry isn't there hardly at all which is unfortunate. Corey Stoll is our villain and he is good but not great. Every good superhero movie can be make or break by the villain and he does okay but he doesn't hit greatness. Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and T.I. round out the supporting cast as Rudd's buddies and comic relief for the film. They are good but unnecessary and sort of get in the way more than help.<br/><br/>Peyton Reed was a bit of an odd choice for director of this film. I think he's a good director (he did direct the now classic Teen flick Bring It On - no I'm not joking, I love the original Bring It On) and he has far more experience in comedy than action. Ant-Man just feels like it doesn't know where it wants to go. It bridges the Marvel Universe by mentioning Iron Man, Thor, Stark, Avengers and features Falcon in a cameo role. Ant-Man should have been a Marvel One-Shot or as previously mentioned a kids film because it just barely passes as being entertaining and it feels like it has a lot of issues and a stumbling pace. Its okay at best and Marvel is always better than okay. Ant-Man is unnecessary to the Universe and I can guarantee you, there won't be a part two even if he does join The Avengers. This one drags down the overall quality. 6/10"

And this could be the main reason for which I couldn't care that much for the characters, because I actually didn't care about them. In fact, the development of the characters is very simple and basic, it was all just so expected. The presence of comedy in many scenes made the movie go a little flat and because of it I had trouble finding whether the characters were in real danger of if I should just relax as the scene would put them in another comedy moment. I actually got to the movies expecting an intense live-action movie with great visual effects; I believe I only got the second of these, plus a relaxing --and very effective, though-- comedy and middle- action movie. Although, I did have a lot of fun watching this movie, and I'm pretty sure it's going to do great. Watch this movie a Wednesday at 7 pm or a Saturday at 2 pm; they're easy hours for an easy-to-watch movie."

","Granted, ant-man was never really the mostinteresting or exciting of all the characters in the Marvel universe, but this movie definitely isn't up to Marvel's usual high standards. Hell, even the Amazing Spider Man movies were better than this Ant-Man is just plain boring. Granted, there are more than a few moments of humor in this, but until near the last 45 minutes of the movie, there is almost NO action. The majority of the movie is spent watching Scott Lange and Henry Pyme sitting around trying to figure out how steal Pyme's Ant Man suit out of the laboratory. A complete snoozefest. I kept hoping that it would get more interesting, that's the only reason I watched the entire movie. Unfortunately, it didn't. And now in the upcoming Captain America: Civil War, their having this most boring of characters join the Avengers? Give me a break."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","5","5","12","19 November 2015"," Paul Rudd keeps the film afloat, barely
","If you watch Ant-Man just to sit back, watch a couple fight scenes, laugh a little and eat popcorn then it's not half bad. If you expect it to inhabit qualities of good cinema, with moderately original characters or plot, then you will be quite disappointed by this tedious bore.<br/><br/>Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) just got out of prison for burglary. What does a former inmate do once he's out of prison and can't find a job? He does what he knows. Unfortunately, that last job has some major implications and somehow he gets roped into a scientist's mad plan to use a super shrinking suit to pull of one last heist and hopefully save the world.<br/><br/>I'm always down for an anti-hero Marvel flick. The character dynamic is always fun and refreshing in comparison to the stale Marvel method that is churned out year after year. Unfortunately, Ant-Man fails miserably and is the most formulaic of all the Marvel films released. Take guy who reservedly accepts his fate as a superhero savior, add close circle of mentor, bad-guy and love interest and there you have it. The details are purely incidental and are really of no consequence to the film itself.<br/><br/>The most frustrating and infuriating aspect of the film is Evangeline Lilly's character Hope. Nothing about her character is thought out except that she is the generic 'capable girl' trope. Her behavior is illogical in relation to her father, the scientist, played by Michael Douglas. Everything about Hope is the templated tough girl crime show character with a dash of femme fatale and her scenes are cheap and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The saving grace for Ant-Man is Paul Rudd. He injects sly humor and his natural charisma within each scene, providing the film with life and vibrancy. Without Rudd, Ant-Man would have been as flat as the much maligned Daredevil. With Rudd, it is still lame and forgettable without the cool fight scenes or laughs to distract.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all this year's blockbusters."

","In 1989, the scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) quits working for the S.H.I.E.L.D. when he discovers that they have unsuccessfully tried to replicate his shrinking technology named Ant-Man that he considers too dangerous for mankind. In the present days, Dr. Pym was forced by his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and his former protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) to leave his company Pym Technologies to them. Further, he finds that Darren is developing his own shrinking technology named Yellowjacket.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the small-time burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and welcomed by his former cell mate Luis (Michael Peña) that wants him to participate in a heist. However Scott wants to find an honest job to take care of his beloved daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) that lives with his estranged wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her future husband Detective Paxton (Bobby Cannavale). However his criminal record does not give a chance to him and he accepts to participate in the heist of the house of a millionaire. He finds only a special suit in the safe and he is arrested again by the police. Soon he learns that he is part of the scheme plotted by Dr. Pym and Hope to make him a superhero wearing the suit and save the world destroying the Yellowjacket. Without any alternative, Scott is trained by Dr. Pym and Hope in the beginning of an incredible adventure. <br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is a highly entertaining adventure with another Marvel (unknown) hero. The plot is very funny and it is funnier to read reviews showing plot holes based on science and forgetting that the story is based on a comic magazine. The special effects are also great and it is good to see Evangeline Lilly again. There are two scenes entwined in the credits, the last one in the very end.

","Action and humor were well balanced in Ant Man, some of the battle were quite cleverly staged. I was surprised Paul Rudd actually pulled off being a superhero. The supporting cast was good as well. Corey Stoll was a great casting choice as the conflicted prodigy of Pym. Also the casting of Michael Douglas as Professor Pym brought credibility to the film. <br/><br/>At first I wasn't keen about seeing the movie, as it looked too silly in early previews. Fortunately I gave it them the benefit of the doubt (mostly because it's a marvel movie), and really enjoyed the film. I don't know if box office receipts will be enough to warrant a sequel, but I would definitely see a part 2 if they made one."

"KnightsofNi11","6","7","19","17 July 2015"," A dip in quality for Marvel, but still a damn good time
","For the next five years a Marvel Cinematic Universe film will never be more than 6 months away. The Disney owned studio is pumping these things out like the world is ending, for better or for worse. Some end up being dazzling action spectacles and some end up being uninspired disasters. Then there's Marvel's newest film, Ant-Man, which falls somewhere in between as a competently entertaining, yet intrinsically flawed film. It's nothing more than middle of the road superhero fare, and there's really nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>Ant-Man marks the end of Marvel's Phase Two. If Avengers: Age of Ultron was Phase Two ending on a bang, Ant-Man is the quieter fizzle that follows. It also marks Marvel's first return to telling origin stories since Captain America: The First Avenger. Yes, Guardians of the Galaxy was new territory but that's far from the origin story model that Ant-Man so closely adheres to. The film follows ex-con Scott Lang who is hired by Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, to carry out a heist to get Pym's shrinking technology out of the wrong hands. Scott, motivated by the love for his daughter who is in the custody of Scott's estranged wife, accepts the Ant-Man torch passed to him by Pym, and by the end of the film the newest member of The Avengers is born.<br/><br/>I'll admit, Ant-Man starts out rough. I went into this movie with skepticism, mostly fueled by how badly I wanted to see Edgar Wright's version of this film. After seeing what Ant-Man became after Wright's departure I'm not terribly disappointed but I want to believe Wright's insight could have saved some of the weakest parts of this film. Those parts in question surround the human relationships that the movie tries so hard to make us care about. You've got Scott's relationship with his daughter, as well as Pym's relationship with his driving the ""emotion"" of the film. It didn't take me long to realize how little I cared about either. This script tries incessantly to get us invested in the human element at the core of this story, but some of the most sentimental moments played so cheesy, and some pacing issues stuck scenes of important character development in oddly random places.<br/><br/>As the family drama bullshit continued to develop I really started to think Marvel had churned out a dud. Then about 20 minutes in Scott shrinks for the first time and my whole opinion of the film started to change. Despite everything else, I was reminded that this is a superhero story. Ant-Man takes a while to establish itself as what it actually is, which is a strange yet fun mish-mash of genres. At it's core Ant-Man is a by-the-books superhero origin film, but it also wants to be a comedy, which is something it succeeded at about 70% of the time. It's lucky enough to possess real comedic talent in it's lead, Paul Rudd, and Michael Pena who steals the show as the goofy fast talking friend/sidekick of Scott's. Then, in terms of the action, Ant-Man is also a heist film that utilizes all the beats and tropes of bank robbery flicks of the 60's and 70's. This amalgam of genres doesn't always work, but it gives you enough of reasons to enjoy Ant-Man. <br/><br/>I think what will save this film from being lost in the halls of Marvel is the uniqueness of its action. For years we've been so used to big action spectacle from these films. We expect buildings to blow up, cities to be destroyed, and larger than life figures to be punching each other as hard as they can. Ant-Man gives us something so fresh in its macro spectacle, turning the inside of a briefcase into a battle arena and a little girl's bedroom into the battlegrounds for a final act showdown. Marvel continues to work its visual genius here, making the ant sized world come to life and feel so authentic. There is some great use of macro photography that puts us right in the middle of the action making something as mundane as a bathtub an exciting venue for CGI fueled excitement.<br/><br/>In many ways Ant-Man is a breath of fresh air. However, there's a lot in the writing that makes this film feel like a story we've already seen hundreds of times before. All in all Marvel has delivered to us another entertaining use of two hours. This is by no means a bad film. It's a problematic film that saves itself with the familiar spectacle of Marvel given to us in an unfamiliar fashion. There are a lot of other Marvel films that I would recommend before this one, but Ant- Man has still succeeded in being a lot of innocent fun. It teaches us that, sometimes, that's all you can really ask for."
"xmonn","9","7","19","15 July 2015"," Far better than expected - from a non-Marvel fan
","ANT-MAN (PG-13) ***1/2<br/><br/>Beginning with the first ""Iron Man"" through the most recent ""Age of Ultron,"" the series of Avengers films co-produced by Marvel and Disney have all but redefined the comic book franchise model while setting the global box office ablaze. Plans for more movies extend well into the next decade and there's no reason to believe that the multi-character assembly line will ever run out of material. While the collective of films are basically bullet (and critic) proof, it is possible for the occasional effort to under-perform and ""Ant-Man"" will be put to such a test this weekend. It is both natural and understandable, if not exactly fair, to compare ""Ant-Man"" to the other Marvel flicks on a multitude of levels, the most obvious being (all pun intended) size. The title character, aka Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) – with the aid of chemicals and a magic suit – has the ability to shrink down to the size of (duh) an ant which frankly isn't all that sexy compared to the talents of his contemporaries. Thanks to some perhaps overlong exposition in the first half, the quartet of writers apply some clever narrative spin and make the character if not sexy, at least funny, relatable and not nearly as deathly serious as the rest of the Marvel gang. The sense of joy exuded by the characters and the brisk pace of the presentation is infectious. There's no faux soul-searching or ponderous navel-gazing going on here. While some won't care for what's most clearly missing from this Marvel venture, there will be many others that will revel in the (again relative) spare use of CGI, the toning down of the usual overblown audio bombast and a marked avoidance of the typical, tortuously long running lengths. If there was ever a scaled-down Marvel movie, this is it and it is more than welcomed. In addition to the always affable and impossible-to-hate Rudd, director Peyton Reed populates the rest of the cast with performers who all slip into their respective roles with effortless ease. As Ant-Man inventor Hank Pym, Michael Douglas has perhaps the toughest challenge as Pym is called on to be surly and bullheaded most of time while still remaining warm and avuncular. Showing up with clipped anger, simmering resentment and an acid-tongue, Evangeline Lilly co-stars as Pym's estranged daughter Hope. She now works for Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), Hank's one-time protégée and his current principal rival. Unlike a great many of the Marvel villains, Cross is genial, charming and seems to still harbor genuine affection for Hank which makes his character a mystery until well past the halfway point. Think of Cross as a slightly less evil version of Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) from ""Iron Man."" In smaller but no less important roles, Bobby Canavale plays a detective now engaged to Scott's ex-wife (Judy Greer) and Michael Pena, Tip ""T.I."" Harris and David Dastmalchian as three ex-cons who eventually become part of Hank and Scott's unconventional crew. While the main plot includes the requisite ""save the world"" motif found in all of the Marvel flicks, ""Ant-Man"" is mostly a heist movie where gadgets and cloak & dagger elements supplant the usual otherworldly hocus-pocus. It's more James Bond than Avengers. For long-established fans that treat the original source material as sacred scripture this will be unsettling but for the casual viewer, it's major plus. The significantly toned-down violence also makes this the most family-friendly Marvel effort to date. Those familiar with the history of the production are already aware it was a long, often tumultuous haul. Starting in 2006, director Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hot Fuzz"") and his collaborator Joe Cornish wrote multiple drafts of their script and a few years later Wright was pegged by the studio to direct. In early 2014, events transpired that remain unclear but the scuttlebutt indicates it was something akin to the go-to, generic ""creative differences"" excuse between the filmmakers and Marvel. Others supposedly in the know surmised it was Wright's strong reluctance to turn ""Ant-Man"" into a Marvel spin-off and keep it as a standalone single installment. This is the most popular theory and, after viewing the film, it makes the most sense. Marvel and Avengers references are everywhere but it doesn't detract from the overall quality or tone. Reed did a fine job and in the end Wright and Cornish still received producer and writing credits and, more than likely, beyond-healthy paychecks. (Marvel/Disney)"

","Well, it was the only marvel movie that I wasn't crazed about after watching the trailer! Even for Ghost Rider and other similar movies, once I saw the trailer I was like ""I have to see this""!

With Ant-Man, I decided that I wouldn't throw my money at this movie, no matter the cast that seemed really good and promising (Michael Douglas alone was enough). <br/><br/>And then I just went to see if with some friends that insisted... The movie blew my mind! Loved the concept and the technology behind it and after all, this guy was even more masculine than both spider-mans...! I was completely overwhelmed with the connection with Tony Stark and the Avengers connection and I am so looking forward to the sequel or even better to seeing Ant-Man be a part of Avengers! <br/><br/>OK, the concept is a bit far-fetched but come on with this need to rationalize everything and make them plausible in a marvel movie! For God's sake! Ant-Man is awesome in his own way and is better than many many other super-marvel-heroes with better concepts and powers that came and vanished!"
"LloydBayer","8","6","16","30 July 2015"," In comparison to previous Marvel films, Ant-Man is an engaging reiteration that less can be more.
","Along with its mega box-office pull, Marvel's cinematic achievements have also gained a reputation for being loud and repetitive, with emphasis on sheer size and scale. But as we've seen before, it can also be uplifting, laugh-out-loud funny, and thoroughly engaging – all instantly recognisable qualities of Ant-Man. <br/><br/>By cutting out multi-character excessiveness from previous films, Ant-Man is also scaled down to size, albeit literally, with the use of just one protagonist. This works by allowing us to focus on the adventures of an everyday man, but one that is destined for incredible heroics. That man is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a petty criminal desperate for a clean slate. Caught between his reputation as a cat burglar and a failed father, Lang stumbles upon a powered suit that shrinks him down to the size of an ant. ""It's nothing like the Ironman suit"", says inventor Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a former S.H.I.E.L.D scientist. Quite literally, Douglas is saying two things at the same time - don't underestimate the power of an ant, and also that Ant-Man is unlike any other character we have seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br/><br/>Overlooking bland melodrama that has Lang trying to impress his daughter (primed with stock Hollywood cuteness), the film really opens up when we see the titular superhero in action. Filmed with Arri Alexa cameras, visual effects from Industrial Light & Magic is mind bindingly stunning when switching back and forth between macrophotography and life size rendition. Also look out for a de-aged Michael Douglas in the pre-credits prologue (set in 1989), made possible with the use of motion capture technology. And given the context of the story where a lot happens in microscopic proportions, effects are aided with the proper use of 3D, resulting in a rare occasion where it actually works in favour of the cinematography. <br/><br/>With just the right amount of action combined with potent laughs (watch out for Michael Pena Peña as a motor mouth), Reed, in combination with comedy writers Joe Cornish and Edgar Wright, keeps the story simple and easy on the eyes. And owing to the obvious detachment from the juggernaut trappings of previous MCU films, there's none of that city demolishing nonsense that has become a standard in superhero films. Instead, the story remains enveloped in the fantasy ethos that illustrates how an ordinary person can become extraordinary. <br/><br/>The fact that Rudd (up until this point) has been cast in romantic-comedies makes him the ideal choice to play this unlikely hero. Equally unlikely is Peyton Reed, having directed a string of romantic-comedies that nobody remembers. There's a reason why their collaboration in Ant-Man works to everyone's benefit, much the same as Chris Pratt and James Gunn, who were both underrated before 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy. While it's apparently easy to make blockbusters with over the top action (looking at you Michael Bay!), Ant-Man is self-aware of its limitations, resulting in another rare occasion where less is more. That alone should be a educated answer to an age old debate – Does size really matter?"
"Blurviewer","6","6","16","25 July 2015"," Nonsense
","The best experience in this movie would be its shooting and lighting. I was quite enjoying that it showed characters wonderfully though the angles it was filmed and the use of lights/shadows. I did not have the chance to watch the 3D version, but still, I have to say that it brought quite a lot excitement to audience as a sci-fic.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I would say the story is totally nonsense but making fun. A nice try of the special kind of superman and the imaginary is a good start. However, in many scenes, stories are ridiculous without any evidence as basis. It was lack of concrete explanation of how this story line is working and it was like shooting whatever they wanna shoot without making them as a whole, logical scenario. I got fun but also was disappointed."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","6","16","24 July 2015"," The most unconventional superhero movie ever made.
","Ant-Man tells the story of Scott Lang/Ant-Man(Paul Rudd). Scott is an ex-convict who has been freshly released from prison. Scott has a degree in electrical engineering but, due to some unavoidable circumstances, ended up becoming a skilled cat burglar. Enter Dr. Hank Pym(Michael Douglas). Pym gives Scott a chance to redeem himself by advising him to don a special suit, that enables the wearer to shrink to the size of an ant but, increase in strength & speed. Hank Pym tells Scott to embrace his inner hero & become the Ant-Man. Now, it is up to Scott with the help of Dr. Pym & his daughter, Hope van Dyne(Evangeline Lilly) to plan & pull off the perfect heist & save the world from the power hungry, Darren Cross/Yellowjacket(Corey Stoll) & his diabolical plans. <br/><br/>Ant-Man is the most unique, hilarious, weird(in a good way) & self-deprecating superhero film ever made. It's fantastic(pun intended)! The special effects are surreal. The CGI ants look extremely lifelike. The 3D has been put to great use throughout the film. The sequences where Ant-Man shrinks down to the size of his namesake are a treat for the eyes & make for some super fun & exciting set pieces. The constant switching of camera angles between our point of view & how the world looks from the point of view of an ant is one of the highlights of the movie. You can't help but laugh at how insignificant the fisticuffs between Ant-Man & Yellowjacket look like from a human being's point of view especially in the climactic showdown which also involves the beloved, Thomas the Tank Engine toy train. That's the charm of this movie. The film doesn't shy away from just how ridiculous its premise is & takes digs at itself from time to time. Another refreshing aspect of Ant-Man is that it's not just a superhero movie but also, a heist movie. Scott Lang is the first superhero in cinematic history to have a daughter. Cassie Lang(Abby Ryder Fortson) is adorable. Scott's relationship with his daughter forms the emotional core of the film. I loved the fact that they saved Ant-Man's alter ego, Giant Man & Wasp for future films & concentrated solely on the origin story of the titular character. The scene involving Sam Wilson/Falcon(Anthony Mackie) is brilliant. Other than that scene, I was impressed that they kept the Avengers references to the minimum. However, producer Kevin Feige, director Peyton Reed & company make sure to keep reaffirming the viewer that this movie is very much a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As always, Marvel's casting choices are bang on target. Paul Rudd, who has mainly acted in comedy movies thus far, is spectacular as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Rudd is perfect as the slightly awkward, down on his luck cat burglar, whose life changes after he meets Hank Pym. Michael Douglas is amazing as Dr. Hank Pym. It's super cool to see an acting legend like Douglas, star in a Marvel movie. Evangeline Lilly is brilliant as Hope van Dyne. Lilly is the most feisty of all the Marvel women, including, Peggy Carter(Hayley Atwell), Pepper Potts & Jane Foster. Corey Stoll is excellent as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket. Bobby Cannavale is good as Paxton. Anthony Mackie is great as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Judy Greer is impressive as Maggie Lang. Abby Ryder Fortson is unbelievably adorable as Cassie Lang. Michael Pena is hysterical as Luis. David Dastmalchian & T.I. are effective as Kurt & Dave. Hayley Atwell, John Slattery & Martin Donovan are awesome as Peggy Carter, Howard Stark & Mitchell Carson respectively. Stick around till the very end of the credits for 2 incredibly important scenes. According to me, Ant-Man is on par with Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014) for the title of the best standalone Marvel movie ever made. An absolute must watch on the big screen, especially in 3D."

","Although Ant-Man is one of the founders and member of the first Avengers team in the comics, he's quite unknown to people who aren't readers of comic books. But once again, Marvel has proved that the company knows how to deliver a funny, well-crafted and amusing film. The story may not have a large alien invasion, but has what's necessary to present this particular character. When the ant-man appears shrunk, seeing the world in totally different perspective, thanks to the way they produced these scenes regarding the camera takes, the sounds, they're very absorbing making us desire to see more of it. While you're watching, you should pay attention in details, because the director has already said in some particular scenes, there're some easter eggs and you have to look closely to notice. The links with the rest of the MCU and special appearances don't seem forced at all and fit perfectly during the story.<br/><br/>Scott Lang is played by Paul Rudd, he has a solid and charismatic performance and manages to create a sympathy of the public due to his delightful relationship with his daughter, Cassie Lang (Abby Ryder Fortson). Michael Douglas plays Hank Pym, the first Ant-Man, he has a troubled relationship with his daughter, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). Instead of having a happy and lovely relation, they don't get along with each other, this particular aspect provides more subject to be explored making them more convincing. This movie has a strong focus on the family and its maintenance to in the end be a pleasant and healthy relationship with the people you love. Overall, the characters are very well and the performances successfully create each characters's personality, but the one who steals the show is Michael Peña, playing Luis, a Scott Lang's friend. Every scene which he's in is hilarious, the way Luis portrays, how and what he talks is so funny. In the end, Ant-Man is another success by Marvel in the cinema, this film is a very warm welcome to this character in the MCU and I can't stop wondering what will be done with him in the future films."
"SpoodermanDerp","9","5","13","19 July 2015"," Tales to Astonish
","With the departure of Edgar Wright to direct this film (director of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End and Scott Pilgrim), everyone went nuts. Everyone thought this movie would crash (with no survivors) and fail miserably because if you look at what happened with X-Men 3 (wherein Bryan Singer departed as well and Brett Ratner took the job as the director and we all know how that ended up). This film has been on the plans for years and some even stated that Edgar Wright's script for Ant-Man was one of the best they ever had. So without the snappy and hilarious cuts or shots that Edgar Wright usually makes, how did this film fair? Thankfully Marvel did not stray away from their magic and still was, at moments, reminiscent of Wright's style which benefited the film as a whole.<br/><br/>When going into this film, people are generally obviously gonna have mixed feelings for this. Whether you're a Marvel fan or just a general moviegoer, you're seeing this because it's a superhero film and it's by Marvel. Personally, that's how I felt and before entering the cinema. But once again, like in Guardians of the Galaxy, it was utterly surprising. Ant-Man is one of the special marvels that Marvel has accomplished considering the bold moves they've done. Right off the bat, when the Marvel logo starts showing up, the recurring Mexican music and happy-go-lucky feel is there. Paul Rudd is absolutely likable in playing Scott Lang and Michael Douglas provides an excellent and significant character in this film as Hank Pym. The dynamic of passing on the torch hasn't been as relevant and significant in superhero films and it was fascinating to see this play out really well. The acting was hilarious and outstanding. Michael Peña's charismatic and happy-go-lucky nature truly were the scene stealing moments. Evangeline Lily as Hope Pym was great as well and also surprising, is the fact that the villain in this film (Darren Cross/Yellow Jacket) was actually really menacing and had good exposition as to why he's ""evil"" which past Marvel films have suffered from not doing. The villain was like Obadiah Stane from the first Iron Man film and he was on par, if not better than him.<br/><br/>Moving on to the plot, I have to say, it truly is one of the better and special films Marvel has pulled off. The whole idea of emphasizing on a heist brought a whole new layer of excitement to this film. The whole set up in the first act of the film was average at best, but when the second and third act came along, the film started to boost to hyper drive and was nothing but pure fun and hilariousness. It was built with great tension mixed with comic relief that worked as a whole. The dramatic elements of the film was moving and did not feel out of place more or less. Now the tie-in to the Avengers was surprising for most people (who didn't see the TV spots). There were plenty of references that are sure to bring a smile and even hyperventilate some hardcore fans. <br/><br/>Now on to the action and visuals of this film, Industrial Light and Magic nails it once more. Whenever Ant-Man shrinks and if you take a look at his surroundings, it looks so real because it was indeed real. The use of photo realistic CGI to enhance the background and insert Ant-Man in there provided a great 3D experience and gave way to excellent and sometimes snappy and well timed action sequences. The action set pieces were small, however the film brought in a large scale feel into it. There's no city falling down, there's no headquarters being crushed by a helicarrier, but it felt so huge and grand that I was surprised it gave a great taste at the end of the film. Of course the humor was still intact while the astonishing action was ongoing which always have been proved to be a great mix when it comes to Marvel movies.<br/><br/>As for the flaws in this film, there really isn't that much that comes to mind because this film was just downright fun. If it's to be ranked and compared to the Marvel films, it's on par with the first Iron Man and definitely Guardians of the Galaxy. Much better than Marvel's previous film Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>+A well made plot and premise, +Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym and the cast, +An actual menacing villain for once, +Heist, +Action and Excellent use of visuals bringing a great 3D experience. Verdict: 8.6/10"
"kunalkhandwala","8","6","17","6 August 2015"," Unadulterated entertainer minus all the darkness of a superhero
","Analogous to the creation of most superheroes, there is some radical science behind Ant-Man's suit. Dr. Hank Pym invents a serum that can chemically alter the distance between atoms and when introduced through his suit, the wearer simply shrinks to well, ant size. The concept, even by the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) standards, is quite far-fetched to even consider but a credible script and a solid, commanding performance by Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym, makes you believe that those ants can move sugar cubes into your coffee. Director Peyton Reed (""Yes Man"", ""The Break Up"") simplifies a comic book character's origins story, neglecting the usual darkness associated with such backgrounds and makes it a light, fun, family entertainer. Something the MCU has grown out of unfortunately. <br/><br/>The genius mind of Dr. Pym, while proud of its creation, was equally fearful of it being used by the wrong people. With Howard Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. already in its pursuit, Hank abandons his research, which results in him being ousted from his own company. Years later, it is revealed that his apprentice, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is secretly re-inventing the formula for the serum with multiple trials. His desperate ambition is witnessed by Hope (Evangeline Lilly), who is Hank's estranged daughter but an ally to his moral stand in this battle for atomic supremacy. They must find the one who is worthy of carrying the burden. One who also possesses the necessary skills to become an expert burglar when the situation arises. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been in prison for breaking into a very hi-tech facility but is now struggling with finding a job, spending sufficient time with his daughter and of course, monetarily. Here's a simple guy with simple issues that we can relate to, who needs to prove to his daughter that he can be her hero. A ploy involving a break-in at Hank's home reveals the suit to Scott, who at one instance tries it and barely survives water gushing into the bath tub, a growling rat, tumbles through floors, carpets, being sucked into a vacuum and scores of footsteps on a dance floor after being miniaturized. Hank speaks to him through the suit and assures him that once he gains control and understanding of the suit's power, he can be the hero he needs to be and actually make a difference by stopping the real enemy. After some painful practice and learning to communicate with the ants, this superhero can really kick some tiny ass. He will soon have to infiltrate the Pym servers and break into the vault where the serum is stored, before Cross sells it to HYDRA.<br/><br/>There are several easter eggs in the film with references to agencies, an encounter with an Avenger and of course, not 1 but 2 post credit scenes. Ant-Man is one of the original Avengers in the comic series and Peyton Reed acknowledges his strengths. He keeps the story simple, characters uncomplicated and action pertinent. Most of the CGI sequences look credible while the action sequence along the train tracks is fun to watch especially when you watch it from the normal perspective as the toy train simply tumbles off. Thomas the train engine plays a dramatic role which is one of the film's brilliantly imagined scenes. Then there's the weird looking dog bug that randomly pops up. Several sequences are funny the way 'Honey I shrunk the kids' was and that's quite an unavoidable comparison for a movie that's diminutive in a sense. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd isn't the ideal hero. He's not overly muscular, doesn't possess Robert Downey's swag nor Hemsworth's God-like demeanor. But his inability to relate to any of those action heroes is precisely what works for Ant-Man. The responsibility of wearing the suit came upon him. It clearly wasn't his first choice even though he eventually adopted it like a hero should. That just makes him a charming protagonist for whom burglary is his top skill. He won't head a team against an alien invasion but he could possibly break into the mothership's mainframe unnoticed and take the whole thing down. Michael Douglas makes Ant-Man believable. His conviction in his science, communication with the ants and the importance of such technology remaining hidden from society's evils, is what enables such belief. His part failure as a husband and father, together with his weakness against Cross' power is well conveyed in his expressive performance. Evangeline Lilly looks stunning in a bob-cut and her emotions are spot-on especially in the scene where her mother's true tragedy is revealed. Big spoiler at the end for her too. The most entertaining side-kick performance has to be of Michael Pena. He is hilarious in every scene and the ones where he narrates recent secretive conversations in flashback are among the movie's highlights. His comic timing is impeccable and is a welcome addition to the Marvel side- kick universe. <br/><br/>For all the darkness and destruction that Marvel usually brings on screen, Ant-Man is not only a welcome relief but an entertaining one at that. The one true family viewing of a superhero movie that is unadulterated fun. Could it have been more than just that? Certainly and it did have the potential to take everything up a notch. Do we need a stand alone sequel to the tiniest superhero? Perhaps not, but we would enjoy him as a worthy Avenger who can lighten things up. <br/><br/>8.352 on a scale of 1-10."

","Ant-Man is funny, nice to look at, but a little too clichéd at times. As per usual Marvel Studios has put out a film, that is funny, especially with the comedic chops of it's lead actor. The film boasts a talented cast, including the very talented Michael Douglas, and most of the cast members deliver, especially the very talented Michael Douglas. The special effects are good, but that's no surprise, but a big surprise was that most of the characters had good development, and while the villain wasn't a great villain he was serviceable. All in all the Ant-Man is led by good acting, a good story, albeit a little clichéd, and a good sense of humor. While Ant-Man isn't Marvel's best it's still quite entertaining."

","I had a great time watching this movie. It's fun and suitable for the whole family. In fact, it's more a comedy than an action/sci-fi movie. Don't expect to watch massive CGI effects. There are of course CGI, each time Ant-Man switches to insect size, but without any ""Wouah effect"" in my opinion. The movie focuses on the personal life of the characters, father/children mostly.<br/><br/>The negative aspects maybe? Well, hard to relate to the ""Avengers"" community. We saw this issue with the latest posters showing IronMan, Thor...So they try during the movie to stick to the ""marvel universe"" with the words SHIELD, AVENGERS, CAPTAIN America.. But except for one sequence, it's only words. You don't except after the movie to see Ant-Man in Avengers 3."

","Ant-Man<br/><br/>The best thing about being a shrinking super-hero is that when the fighting starts you can just disappear.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the pocket-sized protector in this sci-fi movie isn't as gutless.<br/><br/>Kindhearted ex-con Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) agrees to help his ex-cellie Luis (Michael Peña) break-in to a vault, but instead of riches he uncovers a suit that allows its user to shrink down and commune with ants.<br/><br/>However, the designer - ex-S.H.E.I.L.D. scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) - and his daughter (Evangeline Lilly) want to teach Scott how to use the get-up so he can stop Pym's protégée Yellowjacket (Corey Stoll) from selling the technology to HYDRA.<br/><br/>With astounding action and periodical romance, this origin story shatters any preconceived notions you may have had of Marvel's C-list Avenger.

","Ant-man, the movie that I thought would be an amazing addition to the marvel series. Marvel movies have been a seamless hit for the past 3 years with the top titles like iron man and the avengers.<br/><br/>Ant-Man left me dissatisfied and wishing they followed the story line of the comic books. The start of the movie was pretty accurate, but as you kept going they changed the plots to fit humor and get as much entertainment out of it as possible. Not all of it was bad though, For people who don't know the story lines and history of the comics for Ant-Man, it would be a way better experience. <br/><br/>I do recommend this movie as it was a good movie to watch. But it left me wishing they would have gone more in depth with the characters and the plot lines."

The movie is also for little kids. The ""science"" here is just too unbelievable as well, but that's got to do with the Ant-Man story to begin with. I couldn't watch the movie straight. I had to keep stopping because it was just too boring. And why do we have to put 10 lines so that IMDb would post our comments? OMG!

"autisticreviewers","8","4","10","10 November 2015"," Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.
","I thoroughly enjoyed Ant-Man. I didn't have high expectations because, honestly, the movie is based on a character whose super power is to shrink to the size of an ant. When you think about it logically it sounds ridiculous. But, as Marvel has proved time and again, they can make that premise entertaining. Sure some of it is a little ridiculous but we're talking about a super hero movie here, not a documentary.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is PERFECT for this role. I don't think anyone else could play Scott/Ant-Man any better. He's smart, funny and as Paul Rudd usually is, honest and real. All that just makes the movie more fun and completely hilarious.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly is also fantastic showing a wide range of emotions and acting talent. I'm so glad she didn't quit acting. I hope to see more of her. She did a great job in this film and it really showcased her talents. Just please, do something better with her hair. That do was awful.<br/><br/>Both Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll round out this cast very well. Douglas is believable and really nails this role. Stoll is creepy, mad and evil, just like the villain should be. And I have to include a shout out to Michael Pena who is absolutely hilarious in this movie. I've seen him do a range of characters and this one was his funniest yet.<br/><br/>All told, Ant-Man is a fun movie. It's not ground-breaking and it doesn't try to be as big as Avengers but it does its part well. It plays a small role in the Marvel universe and is a fun ride. <br/><br/>-Jay <br/><br/>Ant-Man was better than I was 'ant-ticipating', it packs a lot of humor, epic set pieces and fun into this fun and surprisingly family friendly (hence the PG rating) since there are some minor violent set pieces) superhero flick.<br/><br/>The casting of Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and such are all great, with Rudd molding the same path as Chris Pratt and Douglas in top form as always and the supporting cast as well pull it off with ease.<br/><br/>Visual effects and the cinematography are all tops, with making the epic scale of Ant-Man seem so realistic and not taking itself to seriously. The music score by Christophe Beck is great too.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is pure escapism and entertaining throughout, it's bound to win the fans of the MCU and set an exciting path for Phase 3 in 2016. <br/><br/><ul><li>Nick</li></ul>"
"MrDHWong","8","4","10","15 October 2015"," A fitting conclusion to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Ant-Man is the latest installment of the Marvel Movie Universe. I'll admit I had my doubts as whether or not it would be any good, but for the most part, it's a fun and action- packed film. It serves as a fitting conclusion to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Set months after the events of Avengers: The Age of Ultron, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a burglar who is down on his luck in terms of finances breaks into the house of a wealthy man and steals a strange looking suit from his highly secure vault. However, unbeknownst to Scott. the suit and house belong to Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who designed the suit to shrink in scale but increase its users' strength. Pym tracks down Scott, and takes him under his wing to train Scott to use the suit effectively. With the help of Pym's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Scott eventually becomes the superhero known as Ant-Man. Scott's training is now complete, and the three of them must now plot a heist that will save the world from a new, powerful enemy.<br/><br/>The film manages to be both hilarious and emotionally deep in all the right places. There were plenty of really funny moments that don't weigh down the film's serious tone to any extent. Paul Rudd, with whom I'd originally had doubts as to whether he could properly play a superhero, pulls off the lead role pretty effectively, even if he does occasionally lapse into his Judd Apatow-style comedic persona. However, the biggest surprise was Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. He felt like he fit more into the Marvel Cinematic Universe better than any other actor in the film. I also enjoyed how his character played a more significant role as a mentor, rather than just a generic background helper.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10."
"Darth_Sneville","10","4","10","27 September 2015"," Looking forward to this movie for years and it somehow exceeded my expectations! 10 out of 10!
","As one of the world's few die-hard Ant-Man fans, I had been getting pumped for the Ant- Man movie for years. There's only one thing that can mean; it's never live up to my expectations. Yet somehow, the little superhero that could did it! The movie was far better than I could have possibly imagined! I didn't expect Scott to be this likable, the relationship between Hank and Hope so intriguing, Darren Cross to be so ruthless, and Luis, well, I didn't see that coming! Peña is so good in the role, and he's not even the best in the movie. That honor would go to Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, closely followed by Michael Douglas as Hank Pym. <br/><br/>Another thing the movie did well was the way it created an everyman. Scott Lang is possible the most relatable MCU character yet. While we all love Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, and Thor, far more of us are just loving parents or job hunters than genius billionaires, World War II vets, or Gods.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is worth a watch no matter who you are. I've seen people who hate superhero action films love it. This is my all-time favorite film, and, though not the greatest movie ever made, it will always have a special place in my heart."
"HelenMary","7","4","10","7 September 2015"," great fun and entertaining Marvel film
","Along with Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor and anything with Hugh Jackman, Ant-Man is my new favourite Marvel film. I was unfamiliar with Ant-Man previously and was pleasantly surprised. The film passed quickly and enjoyably with sufficient action, story and comedy to make for an entertaining family film (rated 12). Paul Rudd as usual was fun and charming, and believable as the ex-con turned reluctant superhero out to protect his daughter (the very cute Abby Ryder Fortson). Corey Stoll as the bad guy was both credible and strangely likable, charismatic I think you could say, but he is a new popular actor having wowed in House of Cards. Michael Douglas was good. <br/><br/>The action and SFX were slick and really well done. Ant-Man's interaction with the ants was really clever and it was fun to see ants with dog-like personalities. Marvel are known for good SFX and I think this was one of their best examples. Suitable for all the family, I think this Sci-Fi/Fantasy Comic Book/Graphic Novel tie-in would be a good addition to any Marvel fan's collection. Worth seeing on the big screen and this is one film where a 3D option would be valid and worthwhile.<br/><br/>As with all Marvel films, look out for Stan Lee's cameo and stay for the very end of the credits for the sneak previews of the next films. Ant-Man will return!"

","This movie was so funny and so awesome but there are some scenes that are not suitable for small children, other than that this movie was hilarious and I definitely recommend this to Marvel fans out there and what made it even more funny were the very cheesy jokes that they were saying. I so cannot wait for Ant-Man 2 because that is going to be so awesome, but yeah I took my Dad & my Brother to see and we could not stop laughing because of the very cheesy jokes even though it does have a lot of violence along with rude and crude humor. Little kids will definitely love this because of the rude humor and all of the very funny but yet cheesy jokes because my Brother could not stop laughing when the movie got even farther and farther the more funny and cheesy it became after all it is called Ant-Man. The cool thing about this movie is that it was like Spider-Man & Mega Mind because Scott is not used to the Ant-Man Suit and messes everything up exactly like Spider-Man and the thing with Mega Mind is that he is bad at first but then he becomes good. Another fun fact about this is that it is about a man who can shrink down to the size of an insect and Walt Disney Pictures merged with Marvel on a shrinking movie and Walt Disney Pictures is know for the Honey Shrunk franchise which is really funny and cool except they have a Shrink Gun and Scott has a Suit."

","WOW! I watched this movie three times and would have no problem doing it 3 more times. The best marvel film behind the avengers. To start off the acting, directing and screenplay were amazing. The characters were good and had chemistry so the villain had his soft side he wasn't all bad. I mean i kinda liked the ants as much as the actors. Paul Rudd made an amazing ant-man. The movie wasn't taken entirely and had its comedic moments especially Michael Pena, who made me spill my drink with laughter. Not to mention that the CGI was pretty stunning. The villain vs hero fight was funny and epic. The story was really well written. And there was a hero vs hero fight as well which was again funny. If Antman dies in Civil War of Infinity War I'm not going to be happy. I hope they make a sequel. GO ANTMAN!!!"
"alphabravomovies","8","4","10","13 August 2015"," All in all, Ant-Man may be little but he sure as hell packs a big punch! Go for it and please stay for the post-credits scene.
","So, when I heard about Paul Rudd taking on the role of Ant-Man, I was slightly apprehensive about how the film would be. I'm quite fond of him in his usual fare but Paul Rudd as a superhero? My doubts were banished when I finally did watch the film because Paul Rudd as Ant Man is awesome!<br/><br/>Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a down and out ex-con (a cat burglar) who has just been released from prison and is on the lookout for a simple job and life so that he can reunite with his daughter Cassie. Cassie lives with Scott's ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her fiancé Paxton, a cop (Bobby Cannavale) who have a strict policy against Scott visiting his daughter unless he mends his ways and leads a decent, con-free life. After a short stint at Baskin Robbins, Lang is contacted by brilliant scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) who was forced out of his company by his former protégé Darren (Corey Stoll) and daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and is worried that the technology he created has fallen into the wrong hands. Pym's concerns are with good reason as Darren has indeed figured out Pym's shrinking technology and has created his own suit, Yellowjacket. Thus, with Pym as mentor and Hope as his trainer and an army of intelligent ants, Lang is trained in the art of fighting, shrinking and more as he dons the Ant-Man suit to break into the Pym headquarters and destroy evil before it destroys everything else!<br/><br/>So like I said, I was apprehensive about the casting initially but I realize my concerns were unfounded after watching the movie. Paul Rudd perfectly lends touches of his quirkiness and comedic prowess to his superhero self and that's what makes him relatable. He's endearing as the dad who would do anything to meet his daughter but is helpless, believable as the guy who thinks he's a misfit for the job but eventually emerges successful and many more. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym is spot on while Evangeline Lilly does a good job as the angry, headstrong yet vulnerable Hope. My favorite in the supporting cast had to be Michael Peña's Luis, who is effortlessly funny and clumsy and a treat to watch. The CGI special effects are awesome and keep you on the edge of the seat especially in the sequences that Lang is still trying to master the suit! My heart was pounding and my head was light in the scene where Lang dons the suit for the very first time and experiences the power of the shrink button. The battle scenes, although quite less, are well done. The references to the Avengers and the scene with Stark Industries are entertaining as well. Although I'm one who runs at the mention of insects, even I felt a tad respectful for the ants and their work ethic and abilities in this film.<br/><br/>All in all, Ant-Man may be little but he sure as hell packs a big punch! Go for it and please stay for the post-credits scene."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","14","23 July 2015"," Ant-Man was kinda marvelous.
","Indeed, action comes in all sizes. Directed by Peyton Reed & written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd. This movie is based on the Marvel comic book property of the same name. It marks the twelfth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last entry in the MCU's Phase 2 slate. It was a great anty-hero movie. Its story follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a convict who is bailed out of prison by retired inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) for One Last Job: to steal Pym's research from his former company, before it can be abused by the firm's new owner Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). To accomplish this, Pym outfits Lang with the ""Ant-Man"" suit, a piece of technology with the ability to both increase the wearer's strength and shrink them down to the size of an ant. Now, armed with this astonishing ability, con-man Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of evil villains. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say Ant-Man pull all sorts of antics! It was alright for the most part, but there were some things that 'bug' me about this film! First off, the whole movie is very clichés. Everything about the protagonist is kinda mediocre. The whole idea of him, having few legitimate prospects, and a young daughter and ex-wife to pay child support to, but wanting to commit one last job in a heist film before he retires from a life of crime is so overused. I saw this trope, in thousands of films. It's kinda boring. Another thing, is the whole corporate sabotage plot. It remind me, so much of the original 2008's Iron Man, film. I really didn't sense, much originality with it. Paul Rudd is alright as Ant-Man. It shows that he put, a lot of work, into the film, not only by helping write the story, but beefing up his body, very physique. Still, I didn't really see much of his comedic side in this film. By far, the best thing about the Ant Man is his ability to work with the Ants. I really wish, the movie focus more ant-training montages, than Scott, working a safe heist with his ex-con buddies. I really didn't like those characters, too much. I found them to be a bit one-dimensional negative stereotypes. Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym was fine, but it was a bit odd, seeing an older season Oscar winning, American actor like Douglas in a film like this. Still, he really deliver in whole, passing the torch, the mentor type role, very well. At first, I was very against Scott Lang being the Ant-Man, instead of Hank Pym, but I can now understand why, Marvel chose Lang over Pym. Hank Pym's past was indeed pretty dark. It might be a little too-family unfriendly for a Disney/Marvel film. However, I wish the filmmakers took the risk, and deemed Pym as Ant-Man, because it would make this film, more memorable. I would love the film to tackle, his several split personalities issues, his abusing relationship with his wife, and his fall to the dark-side, by becoming Yellow-Jacket, and making Ultron. It would make a very complex film. Instead, the movie plays it, off a little too safe. Evangeline Lilly as Hank's skeptical daughter, Hope could need some work. While, I know, she's there to showcase, her wanting to become the superheroine, the WASP. The chemistry between Scott and Hope is a predictable ""opposites attract"" storyline. I could rather, have that storyline, cut from the film. While, the Marvel Comics 2 comics, Hope van Dyne/Hope Pym was an Ax-Crazy villain called Red Queen. Although she is on strained relations with her father in the film due to her mother's death years ago, she's more-or-less on the side of good here. I really doubt, she'll end up as a villain, in the next couple of films. However, Corey Stoll as the megalomaniacal villain, Dr. Darren Cross was an interested choice. He didn't shine, as much as I thought, he should had. While, Corey Stoll is a tremendous actor, his character was a bit underdeveloped and lackluster, when it comes to his plans. I don't why he couldn't sell, the goo gun to Hydra!? That's seem like a powerful weapon! The movie, Yellowjacket costume was indeed very threatening, and menacing. It's a lot better, than the silly comic-looking version. Still, it's too similar to the Ultron comic book design. I got often confused, coming into the film, on who's who. When it comes to the action, the movie did wonders, with the shrinking effects and some of the de-aged effects. I did like it. I did think the movie, overused the CGI, a bit much. Some scenes were really hard to believe in. Then there were some that were hard to see, due to the small ant-man flying around on the big screen. I would had, focus more on close-shots, than wide shots. The movie pacing is an alright, but it get a bit antsy toward the end. The movie has tons of Easter eggs and inside jokes to make comic book fans, laugh or take notice. Look forward to the Avengers and Stan Lee cameos. The after scene after the credits, will tickle your fancy. Still, my favorite, had to be Darren Cross jokes that the concept of a shrinking human sounds like a ""tale to astonish."" Ant-Man made his debut in the comic ""Tales to Astonish"" #27, by the way. Still, there were a few jokes that were bothersome. The whole product placement gag, with Baskin Robbins was a little forced and Michael Pena was a little too annoying at times. Overall: Compare to the other Marvel Cinematic movies. Ant-Man wouldn't stand out tall, but Ant-man won't go away! It's permanent! It's a small wonder worth checking out! Go see it, if you want to."

","I know that, for many Marvel fans, the Avengers movies are the pinnacle of the MCU. Yet I find them over-wrought and, subsequently, lacking in both focus and viewer involvement. For me, they are, largely, unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Ant-Man, if you will excuse the obvious pun, succeeds because of its scale. It's not trying to be a world-shattering blockbuster and, instead, depends heavily on character development. in that, it shares much with the first Iron Man (in my opinion, the best film of the entire Marvel universe). With a single thread, it mixes humor, family, the struggle to do right in a world where doing wrong is always a temptation and a simple plot together in a very compelling package. <br/><br/>The dialog is snappy, the sidekicks are charming, the villain actually has a bit of depth and the lead actors are all very well cast. The effects serve to support the story rather than become it. <br/><br/>Finally, the main plot theme (to prevent the spread of the technology) almost seems to me to be a correction of the mess that Marvel has made of Iron Man, namely that anyone can put on an Iron Man suit, thereby diluting the unique nature thereof."

Just like interstellar, the experience trumped all expectations and left me as beguiled in my theater seat as watching Jurassic Park for the first time in 93', yeah, it's that good.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is a favorite of mine so I am a little biased I suppose. His drab humor carries the show as far as comedy goes. Beyond the humor you had action sequences that managed to be both hilarious and riveting. I can't off the top of my head think of any other action sequences that were that indelibly hilarious and cute, while still putting me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>Go to the movie, stuff your face with popcorn, get all jacked up on cheap movie theater soda and prepare for a ride that you'll not soon forget."

","Going into Ant-Man, I didn't know what to expect. Coming out, however, I was left pleasantly surprised. Ant-Man isn't the tightest or most well-made film in the MCU, but still manages to be quite entertaining. Deftly mixing humor and action, Ant-Man largely succeeds because of its leading man's performance, as well as its more personal and intimate focus, which reminds the audience that not every superhero/comic- book movie needs to end with a bombastic finale. <br/><br/>First off, Paul Rudd delivers a charismatic performance that elevates the whole film which cements him as Scott Lang. Rudd makes the role his, proving the naysayers wrong by demonstrating that no one else could've been better for the role. Michael Douglas also shines in his role as Dr. Hank Pym, the creator of the Ant-Man suit and tech. Decades since his big-screen debut, Douglas continues to be an enjoyable presence in the films he stars in. Pym's daughter, Hope van Dyne, is played by Evangeline Lilly, who is quite solid and manages to be one of the better leading ladies in a Marvel production. The rest of the cast is also quite enjoyable, especially Michael Peña as Lang's former cellmate Luis, who manages to steal almost every scene that he is in. <br/><br/>Although the supporting cast is solid, some of the characters feel underdeveloped, namely Corey Stoll's Darren Cross/Yellowjacket. Stoll's performance is actually quite solid, and he manages to make Yellowjacket a better villain than say, Christopher Eccleston's Malekith from Thor: The Dark World. However, as is the case for the majority of the films in the MCU, Yellowjacket simply doesn't compare to the rest of the film. His motivations for evil are murky at best and he deserved some more development to prevent him from feeling one- note. <br/><br/>However, Yellowjacket is partially redeemed for the role he plays in one of Ant-Man's best aspects: its action sequences. Inventive and playing off of Ant-Man's powers wonderfully, these sequences help Ant-Man avoid the cut-and-paste feeling that now plague action movies and are genuinely captivating, despite the film's smaller scope. The action sequences also help the film establish its distinct identity in the ever-expanding MCU and it will be interesting to see how Ant- Man's powers are shown in future installments. <br/><br/>The plot, which has been described as Marvel's first heist, is straightforward and simple, but not to the film's detriment. Instead of being bogged down by backstory and mythology, the film manages to keep its focus clear until its finale. The heist aspect manages to keep the film fresh compared to the other films in the MCU, and the actual heist is exciting to watch. The film wouldn't work quite as well as it does, however, if it weren't for its comedic side. Sure, not all the jokes land, but the majority do and there are quite a few laughs to be had during the two hours the film lasts. The balance between action, comedy, and drama struck by director Peyton Reed works very well.<br/><br/>Being a fan of director Edgar Wright, I still do question how Ant- Man would've turned out if he had stayed in the director's chair. Reed does a nice job, but if Wright had stayed on board, I wonder if the film would've challenged Guardians of the Galaxy for the top spot in my rankings of the films in the MCU. Alas, Ant-Man manages to impress due to the strength of the performances, its inventive action, and its witty sense of humor."

","Marvel have gave us a couple of good films from avengers to captain America winter soldier and they have also given us some awful films like the first captain America to avengers 2 age of ultron! But this goes to show that if you go back to the original comics you will always deliver and Ant-Man is nothing but spectacular and by far the best Marvel comic universe film they have ever DONE. Paul rudd plays a good scott lang but for me corey stoll (darren cross/yellowjacket) steals the show the action is epic the comedy and gags are timed perfectly which as we know marvel always mess up with this part but can happly say they got it SPOT ON with this film. Ant-Man got the film it deserves seen as tho the original and first ever avengers was Ant-Man and the wasp, pay attention to the 2 yes thats right 2 post credit scenes as it will give you a big glimpse how it all comes together."

","Honestly, I walked into the theater thinking this wasn't going to be as good as other Marvel movies. I thought, 'How could a man that just shrinks get his own movie and be successful?'. And did this movie prove me wrong. The humor was excellent, Paul Rudd played Scott (Ant-Man) perfectly. He kind of reminds me of Tony Stark, with all his humor. The cgi was good, and the part where he sacrifices himself and turns himself smaller than an atom (I think that's what he did, don't remember the actual scientific term) really gave me goosebumps. The only part I had wished they didn't do was Scott and Hope kissing. I felt that was kind of rushed in (like Bruce & Nat) but other than that the film was amazing. Good job, Peyton Reed.

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Brilliant scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), in his desperation turns to con-man Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) for help. Together with a suit that has the ability to shrink the wearer and control hordes of ants, Scott must pull off a heist in an effort to save Hank's research from falling into wrong hands. Ant-Man is the funniest movie in the current Marvel Cinematic Universe. With gut- busting comedy, incredible visuals, and beautifully orchestrated action, this movie clearly shows that the Ant-Man is not to be underestimated. Ant-Man is the perfect blend of action and comedy that makes for one of the more enjoyable blockbusters of this summer.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>It's not surprising that the initial reaction of the general audience when they hear the concept of an Ant-Man is one of ridicule. However, this character has been critical in many of Marvel comic stories. So the question became can they really translate one of their smallest comic book characters on the biggest screen? The answer is a resounding yes.<br/><br/>The main cast of this film were perfect for the tone of the film. Paul Rudd has been supporting character in lot of my favourite comedy films, but here he takes centre stage with his quick wit and charm. At the same time he is not just some joker, and is a completely capable action hero. Whoever casted Michael Douglas as an older Hank Pym was a stroke of genius. Even though he is not the main character he brings so much depth to his role. There is a lot back story to him and in just few moments he is able to convey how that affects him. Also he is not just some grumpy old man, he won't hold back in pulling a punch or two if he needs too. The absolute show stealer is Michael Peña as Luis. I don't invoke God very often, but Oh My God he was hilarious. He is such likable guy that won't let anything take away his smile and so you smile with him. Then, when he starts to tell his stories, prepare for continuous stream of laughter. I would listen to him tell me stories every day. The only weakness for me has to be the villain. I found him to be very shallow and one note. Considering how well the rest of the cast was developed, it's a pity that Corey Stoll's addition was wasted.<br/><br/>Apart from the characters, what makes this movie stand out is the action like we have never seen before. The shifting of scale from large to small was very well used in the fight choreography. The movements had a lot of power behind them and the Ant-Man felt like an unstoppable force. The small scale scenes were ironically the most grand set- pieces of the movie. It was a different way of looking at the world and it was beautiful. Oh, and don't forget the ants! Ant-Man can also control armies of ants and yes they were fascinating creatures that were way more useful in the missions than you might expect. They were basically another member of the heist team.<br/><br/>What I appreciated most about Ant-Man, is the fact that this is a heist movie. With the current trend of comic book movies always setting the stakes higher and higher, with the end of world is nigh, it is nice to pull back a little and tell a much smaller story. The stakes are only high here because of the characters and the father- daughter relationships. In that sense there is a more relatable motive.<br/><br/>So don't underestimate this film, go and watch it. You will laugh more here than most comedies, and meanwhile be enjoying a f-ant- astic cinematic micro world. Paul Rudd and the gang are a great new addition to the MCU."
"The-Sarkologist","6","5","15","18 July 2015"," A rather silly movie
","When I saw the trailers to this film the first thought that entered my mind was ""this is going to be silly"". I guess it had something to do with Antman and Yellowjacket fighting on the model train set and then Thomas the Tank Engine train falling off after cutting away from the superhero fight. After seeing it I'm going to have to say that yes, it was silly, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I didn't like it. Okay, it wasn't great, but it was still enjoyable (though I have a feeling that I am getting a little bored of those superhero fight scenes).<br/><br/>Anyway, I suspect that what is happening is that the creators of the Marvel Universe are in the process of introducing some new additions to the Avengers. This is not surprising since it appears that at the end of Age of Ultron it was flagged that some of the Avengers are retiring (such as Ironman and Thor). However that still leaves me a bit baffled since at the end of the last Thor movie we had Loki sitting on the throne of Asgard, so I suspect that the Thor story arc has yet to be completed (and yes, they will be releasing a third Thor film).<br/><br/>It was cool to see Michael Douglas back on the big screen, at least in an action/sci-fi role, particularly since he seems to only do serious films of late. In fact seeing Michael Douglas once again sort of took me back to my childhood (though I can't remember any sci-fi/action film that Michael Douglas actually starred in – he only ever seemed to do thrillers).<br/><br/>Yes, this film was silly, but that is not surprising since Edgar Wright, the director who conceived the Cornetto Trilogy, had written the screen play. I'm not really all that surprised, especially since I suspect that Wright grew up on comic books, and you can actually see some of his trade mark silliness (especially in the final part where we have the Thomas the Tank Engine grow to full size and go smashing through the roof of the house, or the giant ant that becomes a pet – sorry about the spoilers, but I did warn you). Actually, to me this film seemed to be a lot more light-hearted than some of the other ones, which is probably a good thing, especially after Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>I still want to go back and watch them through again, at least to see the after credit sequences (I always seem to miss them, which means that I should check IMDb before going into the film to make sure than I'm not walking out on anything)."

I mean an Ant man? a power to get your body shrink to the size of an ant? what a ridiculous superpower in my opinion. But, don't get me wrong. i'm a big fans of marvel, and I've followed the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have this question when Marvel Announce to develop this movie ""is he deserve his own movie?"" i mean a film with those kind of power into a 117 minute movie? is it worth?<br/><br/>also, I have this stereotype about superhero movie that usually full of tension and dark. So, When the director name finally shows up. I Confuse with Marvel decision to choose Payton Reed as a director. Why him? isn't he well-known as director of comedy-drama film (Yes man, The Break-up), and now he's gonna direct a superhero movie? Well, in my opinion this movie not gonna be big, and I WAS TOTALLY WRONG. I've got a big entertain and a lot of enjoyment after watching this. <br/><br/>The story is about Dr.Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) who invented the shrinking suit technology to shrink people into a size of an ant. He finally found out that those technology gonna be some big trouble in the future. His mentee Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) made an alternative suit called the Yellowjacket which is used for a war and destructive purpose. to stop this evil plan, Dr.Pym invite Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) a retire-professional burglar. He Stop being a burglar after he came out from jail. and, he promise to start a better living. but, he finally get caught again after got fired from his job, and didn't have a financial support. He finally find a way out to became steal-things expert again. to find redemption and a better live, Dr.Pym offered him to become the Ant Man to save the world.... and her daughter. <br/><br/>the Character development was pretty good. The background of Scott Lang is portrayed by Paul Rudd Excellently. Not to forget, thanks to Evangeline Lilly and Michael Pena who make the movie twice as fun. in the future, I guess Ant Man will have the great impact on Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>i really enjoy the movie! and my disappointment on Falcon because he didn't get enough action on previous film (Avenger: age of Ultron) finally paid off. and, so do my ticket.

"macedones","7","5","15","16 July 2015"," Oops! Marvel did it again
","When Guardians of the Galaxy was announced, all kinds of reactions were triggered. Most of them negative. People who had never heard of them were like ""A talking raccoon and a tree? Hmmm...not interested."". And fans of the comic book were like ""Is Marvel really going forward with this? I don't think they will be able to pull that off."" The movie came out and it proved us wrong. The same thing happened when Ant-Man was announced. And guess what? Marvel did it again.<br/><br/>At first, Ant-Man doesn't sound intimidating and impressive at all. But right after the first fight scenes and visually understanding the skills of this character, you go ""Well, that's pretty badass."". The movie starts tying some knots with some of the past Marvel movies and as it goes, it succeeds beautifully crossing itself with the universe for future events. It has one of the most interesting plots and character developments of all inside the MCU.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd handles Scott Lang just as Chris Pratt handled Peter Quill. You connect with the guy in seconds. Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly also do a fantastic job playing Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne. Their backstories are a great addition to the franchise. And there's one guy who steals the show and makes the movie even better. Michael Peña playing Luis. His character is just hilarious.<br/><br/>There was only one little thing that bothered me in this one: Corey Stoll as Darren Cross. Not saying he is a bad actor, because he is definitely not! It just felt ""same old, same old"" as the villain progressed. The role of the villains became an issue inside the Marvel cinematic universe. Aside from Loki and Alexander Pierce, all the other villains sound and feel just the same. It was not different with Yellowjacket. You don't see him as a big threat, but as a butthurt guy trying to prove he is better than anyone else.<br/><br/>But in short, Ant-Man is awesome. If you're already immersed into this delightful mess that the MCU is, you will certainly have a great time. Go see it!"

","Having seen many kinds of superheroes on the silver screen, Ant-Man was undoubtedly one of a kind. Becoming invincible, having superhuman strength, running speeder than a bullet, flying beyond the sky limit or being a playboy with high-end gadget are some of the few super powers that had been dominating the cinematic world of comic movies. Then there comes the Ant-Man, a superhero who could shrink himself to a size of an ant or smaller & control the insects to complete his missions. Marvel should be appreciated for bringing this ultimate superhero into the screens which were more of a dream back in the years. The comedian Paul Rudd has helmed the role of Scott Lang effectively along with Michael Douglas who plays the authoritative Hank Pym, the scientist who invented the substance that can change sizes. The visual effects showcase a very detail plot making it a visual treat for the audiences throughout the movie. Ant-man is a definite watch for its entertainment, director Peyton's experience with the comedy films & imagination does the trick here."

""I was very impressed by the way you take my safe"" - yeah because good thieves that crack safes don't know that freezing them works good on them. Also how does the suit fit him perfectly when he tries it in the toilet. Also just by the looks of the suit that 10...9...8 timer wasn't enough to do anything especially putting the suit on. What was that ritual to say goodbye from prison - just to show that the hero is also tough? And what was that hispanic music playing? Also have you tried finding something in other peoples homes? I got to say at least for myself that even if they say where that thing is I still need a good chunk of time to find it. He had to find 3-4 things to take a copy of the fingerprint (and this didn't impress Pym but rather the cooling of the safe) and then he had to find the tools to freeze the safe and the process itself - and all this in the 20 minutes when the alarm was off. I am just so disappointed of the movies these days and how people love them (for what I ask?), every movie even if its a superhero movie needs to be comedy which comedy is not funny but just a parody ( I have at the joke not because of the joke but thats me).

","Another of the Avenger heroes makes an appearance. Having seen the other Avenger movies I knew pretty much what to expect. A movie full of action mixed up with a humorous dialog and some classic comedy. And Ant-man was just that. A funny action packed spectacle. However, it doesn't really rise to the level of the other Avenger movies. I don't know what does it, it might be Ant-man's hero ability that is more comedy than action. Or the constant size-zapping that make most action scenes fragmented. Or that Ant-man's ability is not consistent within the movie. Oh, I know and have no problem with that the movie is unrealistic, it is in the genre. But that the Ant-man one moment is heavy enough to dent a car's roof but not the ants he is sitting on. A movie need to be true to itself.<br/><br/>Well, it is fun. It is action packed. Paul Rudd does it well in a role unusual to him.

","For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym - the original Ant-Man in the comic books - to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product - Peyton Reed's Ant-Man - is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.<br/><br/>After serving his jail sentence, Scott Lang (Rudd) just wants to reunite with his daughter Cassie and get his life back on track. But he soon discovers that people in the outside world - including his ex- wife Maggie (Greer) and her new cop boyfriend Paxton (Cannavale) - aren't particularly kind to former convicts. Beaten down by circumstances, he agrees to pull off one last heist with his eternally optimistic buddy Luis (Pena). It's a crime that places him squarely in the path of Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), a retired, semi-reclusive scientist who decides to enlist Scott in his life-long mission of preventing the Pym Particle - a technological breakthrough that allows him to become the super- small, super-strong Ant-Man - from falling into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>Truth be told, Ant-Man gets off to a somewhat shaky start. The tale of an honourable rogue who's looking for a shot at redemption is a well-worn storytelling trope, one that the film initially seems to embrace rather too eagerly. As we watch Scott soldier through a host of tiny indignities, the dialogue - still credited to Wright and his co-writer Joe Cornish, with rewrites by Rudd and Adam McKay - is uninspired, and oftentimes uncomfortably on-the-nose. There's no subtlety here, and the sense of fun that accompanies Scott's attempt to hold down a job in Baskin Robbins feels a wee bit forced.<br/><br/>But the film kicks into higher gear, and stays there, once Scott stumbles onto or, more accurately, steals his second chance. His discovery of the Ant-Man suit and all that entails - working with Hank, meeting Hank's aloof but eminently capable daughter Hope (Lilly), training to prevent Hank's former protégé Darren Cross (Stoll) from replicating the Pym Particle for sale to the highest bidder - give the story the shot of adrenaline it needs. In the blink of an eye, this superhero heist flick finds its feet, and transforms into a whirlwind of action, humour and heart. Reed's camera zigs merrily from Luis' unique method of exposition (brilliant) to Scott's attempts to survive Hope's training (bruisingly hilarious), before zagging into the dark, trembling heart of Hank's troubled relationship with his daughter.<br/><br/>Indeed, what makes Ant-Man work so well is its insistence on respecting its characters and taking their concerns and relationships seriously. This provides the film with an emotional anchor amidst all the madcap chaos and gleeful irreverence. Scott's overpowering love for his young daughter runs parallel to Hank's own concern for Hope, and even Paxton - initially caricaturised as the stereotypical brutish new boyfriend - is given layers and depth beyond what might be expected of a film that seems so silly on the surface. This culminates in the film's best action sequence: one that manages to be utterly ridiculous, as the camera cheekily zooms in and out of a conflict that's entirely proportional to the size of its participants; but also deeply heartfelt, when Scott makes a split-second decision between lif"

","Ant-man doesn't bring any new for a superhero story. It is a cliche of character construction.
There only a relevant thing: the capacity of trying to using a well-based scientific knowledge to construct the ""superpower"", what makes it less bizarre, even when using special effects.
Besides that, there is need to develop a bad critic: the construction of all latinos characters is based on stereotypes of dumb, reckless, crime affected and funny. As a latino viewer, I felt offended about the incapacity of exploring in a less different and aggressive way all of this culture.
However, the acting, directing and cinematography are impeccable and all the characters construction, including the villain (what it is no expected of Marvel), are solid."

","We open almost twenty years before the first Iron Man in Nineteen eighty-nine. Dr. Hank Pym (a brilliant Douglas) is meeting with S.H.I.E.L.D's head of defence Mitchel Carson (a rather slimy Martin Donovan), along with Howard Stark and Peggy Carter. Pym has discovered that S.H.I.E.L.D. are trying to replicate a very special and powerful formula of his for their own use and he vows they will never get their hands on it.<br/><br/>After skipping back to the present time, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Perks of Being a Wallflower) is leaving prison (see the WHiH Exclusives regarding that) and is picked up by his old friend Luis (a wonderful Peña). Determined to now go straight and confident of landing a job with his Masters in engineering, Scott ends up working at a fast food joint in which he promptly gets fired due to his past transgressions.<br/><br/>Unfortunatly for scott he ends up back with Luis and his associates who want him to join up for a job cracking a safe, which they learned about from brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate. Meanwhile Hank Pym has been invited to Futures Lab at Cross Technologies for a presentation regarding a tiny super soldier headed up by Darren Cross, the former protege and student of Hank's. Darren is making huge strides in replicating Hank's formula is ready to sell it to the highest bidder (yup you guessed it, HYDRA).<br/><br/>Now for myself this was an unusual Marvel superhero film. It never really feels like a superhero film and nor does it ever really feel like a Marvel film either. What it does feel like though is a typical Edgar Wright production and the whole film plays out more as a Wright comedy than a Marvel film. All it needed was Pegg and Frost to pop up and everything would have complete in the world. In all seriousness though, I'm very surprised neither were shoehorned in somewhere for a quick cameo (or I missed them).<br/><br/>The plot line is a little convulated and uneccessary but it flows along nicely without any awkward moments and there is never really a moment where the film drags, though the start of the film left a lot to be desired and could have been stronger. The script is actually half-decent and fits the whole vibe of the film, though the comedy and one-liners are typical Wright, so if you are a fan of his you will know what to expect.<br/><br/>Cast wise, everyone is pretty good here. Michael Douglas is excellent as one would expect but I really wasn't feeling Evangeline Lilly at all. She was much better in The Hobbit films. Paul Rudd, while never a favourite of mine is largely excellent and from what little I know, seems to fill the boots of the character very well. The three wombats (as Pym despairingly refers to them) provide the majority of the laughs with most of those coming from Peña.<br/><br/>The special effects are pretty good and while there is nothing particularly outstanding happens in terms of explosive set-pieces, the miniature (or enlarged, depending how you see it) action scenes are pretty well filmed and do add a great sense of scale. There is a little too much blur in some of the sequences but it does not put you off visually too much. Likewise the soundtrack is also good and fades nicely into the background without being in your face (ala Iron Man).<br/><br/>Overall Ant-Man is a fun film (if not a stellar character in Marvel's line up), and it is certainly helped along by great casting and Wrights script. Direction is adequate from (once again for Marvel) a primary television director. I didn't expect to enjoy this one as much as I did and while again the character is rather weak (from an interest point of view) this film does make the most of his rather modest attributes. A middle of the range movie for the cinematic universe.<br/><br/>

","Paul Rudd (""Scott Lang"") commits a crime of principle that results in his going to jail. When he comes out to his daughter and ex-wife (married to a cop), he can't even get a job selling ice cream. Desperate times call for desperate measures and he finds himself robbing a vault in which he discovers a strange suit. When he dons it, he shrinks to the size of an ant and attains super strength. Scared by this, he attempts to take it back but is arrested ninth attempt then finds himself enveloped in a complex plot lead by Michael Douglas (""Dr. Hank Pym"") to regain control of the company that built it all from the megalomanic control of Corey Stoll (""Darren Cross""). It's quite an enjoyable tech-fantasy and Rudd brings a good deal of fun to the role as he tries to save the world... The SFX are cleverly executed and it is fast paced. The dialogue, however is rather uninspiring and the set-piece nature of many of the action scenes grow repetitive after the umpteenth time. At 2 hours long, it could do with a bit of judicious trimming to compact it down a bit - but it is, nonetheless, quite an enjoyable comedy sci-fi."

He's clumsy and makes lots of mistakes, as a new superhero should.<br/><br/>Michael Pena was also very funny with his mates. His one liners gave the movie a light jokey feel throughout. Evangeline lilly was also a strong supporting actress, although her hairstyle seemed a bit odd.<br/><br/>Marvel does seem to have an odd increase in its advertising though by this point.

Ant-Man has been in development Hell for years, it had originally been planned to come out in Phase One. But what we got was a funny Phase Two movie with really likeable characters.<br/><br/>Originally Edgar Wright (director of Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and Baby Driver) was directing this film. But Marvel wanted to put connections to the other films in the universe in there, so he left. Marvel hired Peyton Reed instead, and he did a pretty good job in my opinion, but I would've loved to had seen what Wright would've brought to the table.<br/><br/>The cast is very good, with a likeable charm to most of the main characters. Paul Rudd is very charming, and his goal to make his daughter proud is very well done. He is also very funny. Michael Douglas is great as Hank Pym, this mentor to Scott with an estranged relationship with everyone else in his life. Evangeline Lily is great as Hope van Dyne, who really shows that she should be wearing the suit, which makes it very satisfying when she does in the sequel. Corey Stroll is fine, unfortunately another forgettable villain. Michael Peña is very funny as Luis, and his flashbacks are comedic highlights. The cameo from Falcon is also done very well and is a very entertaining fight scene.<br/><br/>The writing is very comedic throughout the film, but it does have a good heart to it. The father-daughter relationship of both Scott and Cassie and Hope and Hank is done very well, and is very touching. The film is very funny as stated, and self aware about how goofy it's premise is. You can tell some scenes are leftovers from Wright's script though. It also follows a formula very similiar to Iron Man.<br/><br/>The effects are cartoony, but very well done. The first scene when Scott shrinks is amazing to look at, and every shrink scene afterwards is just as good. The final fight between Ant-Man and Yellowjacket is so entertaining, just taking place in a children's play set is awesome. The effects are great.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is the little movie that could, pun intended. The somewhat formulaic plot and weak villain are carried by one of the most likeable solo film casts in the whole MCU. Ant-Man is just a fun side film, and it relishes in that fact.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Ant-Man finally has a live-action movie! 3 years ago, and I watch it like every month. It's one of my favorite characters in Marvel Comics, and it finally has a movie, and it was as i expected.. disappointed me in some points, but as a whole movie, it's so charming!<br/><br/>I found it boring sometimes, because of the slow-telling. I really believe that if they just got attention for some points they totally just let it go in the movie and the comics, it would have been the best MCU movie of all time.<br/><br/>The cast is super-funny together, but once again the creators didn't gave them the chance to unleash their entire sense of humor... But it stills a funny movie though.<br/><br/>The story is rich, but not that rich I wanted as I said up there.

","Okay, I'm a little biased because I've always loved Ant-Man (and the Wasp, but we're not there yet. It's fine), but y'all. This movie is genuinely fiiiine. Please consider:
1. Michael Peña and the rest of the crew are genuinely decently funny
2. Paul Rudd is doing his best and his best is genuinely touching sometimes
3. Evangeline Lilly hot & buff (& sad, find her mom pls)
4. Michael Douglas is... probably trying his best too, could do better though
5. I love Cassie Lang and you can quote me on that
6. The Michael Peña-narrated scenes are genuinely some of the funniest things I've ever seen
7. Tardigrades! Please bring them back in the next movie
8. Ant puns restricted to ant names. Acceptable. Rip Antoni.
9. Far fewer plot holes than average Marvel movie. Damn good heist movie too
10. One star off for sheep jelly and the fact that he had that tank on a key chain despite the fact that it would still weigh as much as a tank
11. Clever use of shrinking abilities to mix up the action scenes in the movie from what we're used to. Excellent job on that
12. Ant training montage. Very good. This pleases us
Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. This has been Ants. Ants. Ants. Ant-Man!"

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Casting and characters. These are two things that Marvel never does wrong. Every character in the MCU is somehow perfectly portrayed by their respective actor or actress. I rarely (not to say never) look at a performance from this franchise and think ""maybe he/she was not the right person for this role."" Once again, they nailed the casting and the character's scripts.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is terrific as Scott Lang / Ant-Man. He is astonishingly charismatic and puts a lot of his humorous expressions into his display. Lang is a highly captivating character with a compelling past which causes him to struggle in the present. People judge him by something he did and not by why he did it. He keeps fighting that unfair discrimination back, but injustice seems to prevail. The writers do a wonderful job of making the audience care for him without it feeling forced. Phenomenal work on creating a new superhero with a great backstory and heartfelt motivations.<br/><br/>Two other exceptional castings are Evangeline Lilly as Hope and Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym. Both share an emotional attachment, and they are connected to the most interesting and touching subplot of the entire film. For a generic origin movie, having such a remarkable yet predictable side-story is a plus since it helps the film's flow by providing more enjoyable scenes.<br/><br/>Hope is an outstanding character, and Lilly grants her this badass personality which I honestly love. She can get herself deep into her role and seamlessly impersonate Hope's feelings, delivering some really emotional moments. Michael Douglas is a legend, and he proves that he still has a lot to give. Excellent portrayal of Hank and fabulous chemistry with Lilly and Rudd. Michael Peña is also very funny as Luis, and he is the main source of the trademark Marvel comedy, spread throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The action is undeniably unique. Watching what would be a regular action sequence in a small-scale is awkwardly exciting, fun and extremely entertaining. I love how Peyton Reed approaches these sequences as well as Ant-Man's training. The CGI is top-notch, and the fights choreography is pretty good. I have to praise the editing of these set pieces because it definitely improves them by transmitting to the spectator a comprehensive view of what is happening.<br/><br/>I don't really have what I usually call flaws. I mean, this is an origin film, so I was not expecting a masterpiece. I never do with this sort of movies. The goal of these films is to introduce a new superhero to the MCU and do it right. Do it in a way that the audience can understand where the protagonist is coming from, what are his motivations and naturally create an interesting and entertaining story that can supplement that character development. As far as origin movies go, this is yet another success for Marvel.<br/><br/>The only thing I might complain about is the villain. Corey Stoll is fine but his character, Darren Cross, is just another guy who wants to make money out of potentially dangerous equipment. There is an intriguing part of his past that he shares with Hank and I wish they could have explored that a bit more. It would have surely given a whole other layer to an otherwise cliche villain.<br/><br/>Besides that, everything is at least good. The screenplay is good. It is nothing mind-blowing or ground-breaking, it is just a generic superhero origin story, but Reed makes good use of it. The comedy is good. It delivers some chuckles, but it does not leave me laughing like crazy. Even the action, while it is undoubtedly unparalleled, is a hair above good. It is not absolutely awesome like Winter Soldier or Civil War. It is a good origin film, that is it.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is another successful MCU's superhero origin movie. Once again, the casting is perfect. I can't see anyone else portraying Scott Lang besides the hilarious Paul Rudd. I feel the same way with Evangeline Lilly as Hope. Both deliver some excellent performances, as well as Michael Douglas. The original action set pieces reduced to an ant-scale, are super fun and exciting. It is a good origin film, and that is it. No mind-blowing story, no incredible villain, no jaw-dropping action, no epic score. It is just good, and I had the right amount of fun watching it. Primary mission accomplished: fantastic casting for a significantly developed superhero and his future sidekick."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","0","0","6 August 2018"," Refreshingly, this feels like a heist film first and a superhero film second.
","'Ant-Man (2015)' is essentially a heist film that's told with the tried-and-tested tropes of that genre, until it suddenly isn't and it ends in the kind of 'hero versus villain-with-the-same-powers' punch-up that marks it as the more generic - and, ultimately, middling - 'Marvel movie' fare it actually is. Still, there's plenty of fun to be had during the swift and sometimes emotionally-resonant narrative, especially considering that it manages to ostensibly be a comedy without calling attention to itself (in the way something like 'Thor: Ragnarok (2017)' does). In this way, it feels very natural and character-driven, comically and otherwise, throughout. It's also able to keep its core players keenly in focus at all times, making for a generally more personal journey. This results in a picture that's actually rather distinct from its peers but still very much sits among them, an example of an entertaining and engaging superhero film that finds its footing as something not entirely encapsulated - or, indeed, determined - by the broadest definition of that moniker. 7/10"

"shakercoola","6","0","0","26 July 2018"," Smaller in size and scale but no less creditible
","Paul Rudd as the would-be hero brings lots of verve and self-confidence and good comic timing to the role. Ant-Man as a film, in comparison to earlier releases in the Marvel canon, isn't nearly as tightly packed and bombastic and it doesn't exhibit the same kind of rapid, choreographed fighting but it is no lesser film for it. We enter the strange world of the miniscule - where science would present big problems according to shrinkage and theories like ontogenetic allometry - but pay no heed to instincts or science - this is an imaginative comic fantasy. Most of the fun is in the knowingness of its place in the Marvel series for many viewers and the unlikely hero quality of Ant-Man compared to the Avengers. The most touching aspect, though, is his hero like quality to his daughter. There is a feeling by the mid-point of the film that it is positioned to step up the gears and become a full epic treat but sadly that doesn't happen. Nonetheless it is a competent heist film and with good support from Michael Douglas as the troubled scientist."

","Ant-Man was commissioned before Spider-Man returned to the MCU's fold, and I reckon it's good that in spite of the wall-crawler returning to Marvel, it's good that Ant-Man is still having his little universe expanded upon further in the Avengers movies; and of course his own Ant-Man movies.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know anything about the character (like I do not) this movie doesn't depend upon you watching EVERY MCU film out there or anything like that; this is not a homework-y type of movie. It's good dumb and Honey-I-Shrunk-The-Kids-inspired fun but with a superhero sleeve.<br/><br/>Ant-Man gets 3.5/5 stars."
"domtaylor","7","0","0","13 July 2018"," It's a little generic, but a lot of fun.
","It's amazing that, despite all of the production issues involving Edgar Wright's departure, 'Ant-Man' turned out good. The film has a consistent tone and manages to feel like one complete vision. Ant-Man's powers make for a unique superhero tale with some interesting action and the origin story is an entertaining one that keeps its characters at its heart. The film also makes a good attempt at humour which, while not always successful, feels welcome as it fits with the characters and isn't out of place. It isn't a perfect superhero film, however. The character arcs and overall narrative are extremely predictable, and the villain is an especially weak one. It never really breaks the mould, but it doesn't seem like it's trying to. Instead 'Ant-Man' focuses on delivering lots of fun and it does that that in spades. Plus, Christophe Beck's memorable soundtrack is one of the best in the entire MCU. 7/10"
"clareizaguirre","6","0","0","11 July 2018"," Paul Rudd, the universal everyman, short, cheeky and always forever Paul Rudd
","I don't want any superhero films, ever. No interest. I gave this 6 stars because it would be unfair to give a film a bad review because of that reason. It seemed fine for those who know the comic or love the genre, good special effects and music and acting. My problem is Paul Rudd. Is it possible to see a film without Paul Rudd perhaps? Yes, he seems lovely. He seems funny and short and loveable and...Paul Rudd. Whether he tries or not he is pretty much always Paul Rudd. I just can't believe he is in such a heroic and powerful role? Why was he cast? Is there really such a shortage in the whole world that little Paul Rudd was cast as a superhero? The dude can act and I on'y have a problem with him personally but he is hard to take seriously in this film, I believe. <br/><br/>He has kind eyes and is reasonable and like an out of shape once cute dad. He's little and geeky-cool. Like always gets the girl but screws up. Anyway, that's just my opinion. I can't believe the film didn't include that kind of camp chicken dance he seems to do often as well, it would have been the icing on the cake.
Just waiting for him to appear in a horror film now as Paul Rudd, with a different hairstyle as that is the only thing that ever changes."
"mistermclazo","7","0","0","23 June 2018"," ""Ant-Man"" - A Strange, Yet Well-Executed and Funny Movie
","Ant-Man is a great film for fans of superhero movies, or the MCU in particular. It tries very hard to be a funny and remarkable film, which it ultimately succeeds in being. The heroes and villains really put this film in a special place where it becomes more like a thriller than a Marvel movie, but still keeps the vibe you would expect from anything with Paul Rudd in it. It mainly shows the titular Ant-Man, played by Paul Rudd, embark on a journey to save the world, but also prove himself to the people in his life.<br/><br/>However, all this film really does for the superhero genre is cement how an experimental film like Guardians of the Galaxy can become a success both in the box office and with critics. The only thing that doesn't truly make it as great a film as Guardians of the Galaxy was is its by-the-numbers elements. But even with its faults, the good far overshadows the bad. It's a hilarious picture, that uses its overuse of action and bright, blinding colors to its advantage. At times, it's very hard to tell whether you're watching an action film or a comedy. It also does the best with what it has: A semi-popular hero with obscure characters and a small fanbase. Even with such a small interest, it knocks so many other movies from that year out of the park.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas really portrays an older version of Hank Pym like that was the role he was born to play. Truly excellent and honest to the comics. Evangeline Lily does the job of Hope Van Dyne AKA The Wasp, and boy does she do it well. She manages to be a total badass, but still keep her character balanced and level. Corey Stoll plays a maniacal villain. Enough said (although I believe his performance was least convincing, he still did awesome). Abby Fortson was cute and charming, and still keeps her dad going, which is heartwarming and sweet. But no one, I repeat, NO ONE, can forget the star of Ant-Man: Michael Peña's, Luis, the funniest and greatest character in all of Ant-Man. His jokes are the best, and he really gives Ant-Man a buddy-buddy aesthetic. Other great performances were given by Bobby Cannavale, Tip Harris, David Dastmalchian, Anthony Mackie, Wood Harris, Judy Greer, John Slattery, and Hayley Atwell.<br/><br/>Overall, Ant-Man is a charming and funny movie. Even if it's just to introduce Ant-Man into the MCU, it still is a great film for casual or diehard fans. It wants to be a defining picture in its genre, but it really is dragged down by its basic elements, even though I liked it. 8 out of 10!"

","REVIEW - ANT MAN<br/><br/>Yes I finally got around to watching the other insect inspired super hero movie who is a cross between Spiderman, Iron man and Batman.<br/><br/>Spiderman because of his insect name,
Ironman because of his powered suit,
Batman because he is basically a normal gut just with a special suit.<br/><br/>When this film first came out in 2015 I really didn't fancy it at all and when I saw the appearance of Ant Man in Infinity War it didn't impress me, so why did I watch this?<br/><br/>Good question.<br/><br/>Yes funny in places which Marvel or is it DC, (can't recall which is which because of the sheer number of super hero films we are being bombarded with at present) tend to learn towards rather than the dark, emotional and brooding films made by the other studio (whatever it is called).<br/><br/>Watching the film, honestly I just thought it was lazy writing, giving the clue about shrinking into nothingness so early in the film and how our anti-hero (hey is that where the name 'ant man' came from) managed to escape this extra small dimension.<br/><br/>Simple to watch and follow, some excellent comedy pieces by the 3 stooges but just (as I predicted) didn't hit home for me personally, but was an enjoyable watch none the kless.<br/><br/>One thing that really cpnfirmed the lazy writing was with the film is the fact that the inventor of the 'Yellow Suit' (as I said lazy writing), was told by Michael Douglas that he was experiencing mental issues due to using the yellow suit, how? he had only just created the zero particle to power or size down the suit as tested on the lambs, so how could he have used the yellow suit previously to become so mentally unstable to sell to Hydra?<br/><br/>Lazy writing.<br/><br/>Personally for me the highlights of the film were Thomas The Tank Engine and the Tank!<br/><br/>Rating 7 out of 10"

","Marvel is great at making the actors own the role of the superheroes. Ant Man is just another example. Micheal Douglas makes a great Hank Pym. While Paul Rudd is perfect Scott Lang. Paul Rudd uses his comedic timing to elevate the scenes which are generally cliched at this point. Film does cover his personal life without it overshadowing the movie experience.<br/><br/>Scott has amazing team to work with. Evangeline Lily as hope is badass. She takes the role of mature hero. It would be amazing to get her as Wasp in next movie.<br/><br/>Scott's buddies are resourceful and fun. But the character that steals the show is Luis played by Micheal Pena. He steals every scene he is part of. It would be fun to watch him paired with other superheroes as well.<br/><br/>The movie stands on its own, without going too much in Avengers. This makes the repeat watching possible.<br/><br/>In MCU, I was blown away by Iron Man in 2008. While next films in MCU have all felt a little flat to me. I did enjoy first Thor movie, again due to the characters that made the film. But after watching this movie again, this is my second favorite solo movie after first Iron Man. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd is my boy. I hope he doesn't get lost in the Avengers clutter."
"jcruz-42957","7","0","0","26 April 2018"," Ant-Man: 7.3
","Despite having a horrible villain, generic flat cinematography, and physics that don't make any sense at all. Ant-Man is actually a good and fun movie. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang and Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym have some really enjoyable chemistry together that make for a cool mentor and student relationship, but the main relationship that is the film's spine is the relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter. It's a story about a dad who wants to reconnect with his daughter, and it emits a pleasant humbleness to the story. The ants are really enjoyable to watch to their thing and be commanded by Scott Lang, and the 
Ant-Man suit and powers are very well done and make for some fun and satisfying action sequences. The final fight is great mostly due to the fact that it takes place in a little girls bedroom. Which inherently lets in some good comedy that the movie as a whole has as well. It's a consistently comedic movie that has more quick laughs than big ones, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Again the physics don't make sense, but it's forgivable because of the surrounding tone of the story. And the villain is horrible and suffers from the curse of the villain going insane at the end, and the film is shot on some flat and dull cinematography that sometimes makes it feel like a TV commercial. Overall, Ant-Man is a enjoyable light-hearted film that never takes itself too seriously by delivering quickly funny comedy. So I give it a 7.3"
"hakrames","8","0","0","6 April 2018"," Marvel's most hilarious film yet
","Ant Man stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/ Ant Man with Michael Douglas, Bobby Cannavale, Corey Stoll, and Evangeline Lilly in this hilarious action film by Marvel. Following the previous event in Age of Ultron, Ant Man dives into the other great minds in the world and the possible small dilemmas created by this privately owned tech and corrupt corporations. <br/><br/>Peyton Reed directs this movie beautifully with its fantastic cinematography and great direction with the combination of CGI and practical effects making this movie feel as real as possible with its direction. Sadly in my opinion I would've liked to have legendary director and writer, who created this script for Ant Man, Edgar Wright, to direct this film instead. Reed does a good job with what he was handed and balances everything very smoothly. <br/><br/>The script is amazingly written with its tight dialogue and hilarious scenes between various characters, and of course Michael Pena being Michael Pena with his amazing execution and flawless acting. The dialogue feels so fluent I compare it to Iron Man and The Winter Soldiers with the feel of them to this. At some points I forget I'm watching a film and feel like I'm on set myself watching magic get made. And sadly with the writing there are some plot holes with the physics of the shrinking and growing and the 'power' behind some things. <br/><br/>Acting overall is flawless. Corey Stoll may be my only pick for a possible miscasting. Up until the final act I didn't feel the impact of his character as an antagonist until that part. I felt more of him being a crazy scientist type of approach. He did fantastic with the script he was handed and he is a great actor but his casting for it to me just didn't fit it for me. Bobby Cannavale I thought was more of an antagonist than him with his sternness and hatred towards Rudd's character for his past actions and even future ones too. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Evangeline Lilly though all fit their roles perfectly and give this movie character and dimensions too with their hilarious yet serious tones throughout. And this movie made me forget how great of a comic Douglas is. <br/><br/>Overall this film is very enjoyable and entertaining throughout and has some very memorable scenes, Retrieving a thing from a place with a fan favorite character. With some physics issues and a possible miscasting in my opinion, this movie isn't flawless but it'll get you laughing enough to possibly forget about them.<br/><br/>Ant Man gets an 8/10"

","This was good, entertaining, would have been great to see in the theatre with the spc effects, kids will like this one. Its a superhero origin story following Paul Rudd as a con artist who gets a shot at redemption when his mentor (Michael Douglas) asks him to don a super-powered suit that shrinks him down to miniscule size, gives him superhuman strength and the ability to control an army of ants. We watch him learn to use the suit, assorted comical training scenes and fight off villains seeking to steal the invention.<br/><br/>I liked Michael Douglas as the professor and the girl from Lost Evangeline Lilly. I thought Paul Rudd would have been funnier. Some holes in the story, although probably only applying to people like me who don't follow the universe ... not even holes really just questions... when he first breaks into Michael Douglas' house how can he scale the wall so easily? He's a hacker not a burglar right? What is the deal with Anthony Mackie swooping in, what's his story? <br/><br/>Anyways, I liked the scenes where Rudd is shrunk down running in the grass, in the ant hills, liked his relationship with the ants in general ""Antony"" .

Also the last fight scene with Yellowjacket was awesome and when he enters the microverse. <br/><br/>However the post credits were useful since we get a sneak peak of Wasp's costume and Hope Pym would become the next Wasp which I am looking forward to in the upcoming Ant-Man and Wasp.

I also liked the interpretations of Paul Rudd who played as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, Michael Douglas who played as Dr. Hank Pym and Evangeline Lilly who played as Hope van Dyne. Michael Peña who played as Scott Lang's friend named Luis was once more hilarious as the comic relief character and Corey Stoll who played Darren Cross / Yellowjacket made a decent interpretation.

","Ant-Man is a film directed by Peyton Reed. Back in 2015, when I saw the trailers for the film I was quite excited for the film. But not knowing much about the character I still had doubts. But I had a blast watching the film. Three years later as the sequel to this film is approaching, I felt it was the perfect time to review this film.<br/><br/>Plot: Hank Pym, a former Ant-Man mentors Scott Lang to take his place and help him with a heist.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Knowing that Edgar Wright would have directed the film, I felt the film would be quite different from what we have got as of today. But this film is not bad. It's quite entertaining and good. Thank God, the studio retained Edgar Wright as the writer for this film. The characters except for some instantly attract you. The jokes also don't seem out of place. They feel natural to the story. The human element of emotions is quite well balanced in this film. Considering the budget was kept lower the what MCU invests in other films, I felt the VFX was at par to the previous ventures. Never for a moment I felt I was seeing CGI. Kudos to the VFX team. But as with positives, do come certain negatives. I felt as a villain Darren Cross didn't appeal to me. He was very lousy and awkward. Also there is a scene post the epic battle that was a bit over-melodramatic. And then the editing regarding some action scenes. This is where Edgar Wright would have succeeded. The editing is quite choppy which is very cringe-worthy which makes some action sequences less enjoyable.<br/><br/>Performances: It will be very hard for me to imagine Ant-Man without Paul Rudd. I loved him and he embraced his character so nicely. Evangeline Lily was great too. Micheal Douglas was awesome. The pain, anger, sorrow he carried all those emotions with so ease. Micheal Pena was easily my favorite character each time he opens his mouth, I was bursting with laughter. T.I. and David Dastmalchian as provided great support to Rudd's character. Corey Stroll was very unimpressive. I couldn't connect with him for even one scene. Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer and Abby Forston were good. It was good to see Marvel Alum gracing this film with their presence. And finally Stan Lee. Although he comes only for about 10 seconds I always will love him.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Scott and Hope have a pep talk and Scott finally learns how to control the ants. This scene was where you could feel the strong bond between Scott and Cassie. This is why this scene resonated with me the most.<br/><br/>Verdict: Although it misses on a few points, I do feel for an origin story it did quite a decent job. Can't wait for this character's appearance in Infinity War and also the upcoming sequel to Ant-Man.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."

And although it may make me sound like a fanboy, I'm still not sick of them - especially when they're still as fun as 'Ant-Man'! Definitely not one of the bigger superheroes (no pun intended), but Ant-Man and Wasp were original Avengers in the 1960's comics and have always been integral to the Marvel universe. The film does well by including the original Ant-Man, Hank Pym (Douglas, holding up well for a 70-year-old) and tying him in with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Howard Stark, as well as showing some of the Wasp. The film also sets up Ant-Man's involvement in future 'Avengers'/'Captain America' films by having the Falcon (Mackie) involved too.<br/><br/>Brought to you by the director of 'Bring It On' & 'The Break-Up', it's surprising it's not a weak rom-com! Reed does an OK job, but it's hard not to imagine what Edgar Wright, the original director (he still gets a writing credit) - famous for 'Shaun of the Dead' & 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' - would have done with it. That's not to say it lacks imagination or humour - as shown by the tank and the Thomas the Tank Engine scenes - but just that it at times feels a little pedestrian. I guess the PG (and not M) rating also contributes to this.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple, as is fitting a non-super-powered/non-Mutant hero - Scott Lang (Rudd) is a burglar (not a ""robber""!) who is trying to do right so he can be in his daughters' life again. Luckily, Pym and his daughter, Hope (Lilly) come along and give him the opportunity to wear the Ant-Man suit, which has the ability to shrink, thanks to the ""Pym Particle"". The film is fast and fun, with Rudd a great choice for the lead role, with his charm and humour (helped by one of the writers being Adam McKay, best known for 'Step Brothers' & 'Anchorman'). There's some 'seriousness' with Cross (Stoll) as the villain, but it is all very fast-paced and the stakes never seem too high. This won't be anyone's favourite Marvel movie, but it's certainly not a bad one either."

","Expectations were low with this one and the movie takes full advantage of it. So many years mastering the ""hero's journey"" plot give us movies like this one. An unorthodox hero whose story needed comedy, and it has it, but without losing its dignity or getting cynical. THE MOVIE HAS WHAT IT NEEDS IN THE RIGHT MOMENTS IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT, without taking itself too seriously nor too lightly. The comedy works, I laughed a lot, but the dramatic bits are just as efficient, and the tragedy of going sub-atomic adds something unique to the family drama and this particular hero's challenge. The adequate shorter running time shows the studio intentions were more humble this time. It is just a nice entertaining movie, nothing more, nothing less, and it accomplishes its purpose brilliantly. <br/><br/>Special mention to EVANGELINE LILLY, whose lack of faith in the training scenes is hilarious. A character well portrayed and well written, brilliant transition from hate to love in just a handful of scenes. Special mention as well to MICHAEL PEÑA, the comic relief. His rambling explanations are a great, original idea perfectly executed. <br/><br/>The fact that this movie is better than The Age of Ultron proves that studios should relax, keep it simple, stop over-thinking and just make entertaining thoughtful movies, which they are more than capable of doing."

","Scott (Paul Rudd) has been in prison for a year or so. He is an accomplished thief who, alas, got caught. This very much upsets his relationship with his young daughter, Madison, who still adores her biological dad. Nevertheless, she also loves her new stepdad (Bobby Cannavale), a policeman, and her mother (Judy Greer) and lives happily with them. One day, astonishingly, Scott receives information that his sentence is commuted. But, there are strings. A famous scientist, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has requested his services in a serious heist. Pym, you see, has invented a special suit, Ant-man, which allows the wearer to shrink to various sizes, mostly that of an ant. But, an unscrupulous underling, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who Pym fired, is also brilliant and has perfected the technology himself with knowledge gained from his former boss. Pym is a good guy while Cross has no problems selling his invention to the evildoers of the world, for a high, high price. Therefore, Scott is needed to shrink down and steal the parts that make Cross' operations work. It's dangerous. Meanwhile, Scott is also distracted by Pym's lovely scientist offspring (Evangeline Lilly), who has been secretly working against Cross. Can Scott pull this risky mission off and will he ever see his daughter again? This highly entertaining film has a, first, a strong cast. Rudd has his comedic ""nice guy with baggage"" role down pat while Douglas is very fine in his secondary part. Lilly, Cross, Cannavale and the rest are also quite nice. Especially funny is the trio of ex-cons who aid Scott in his new life. The script and direction are strong, too. Above all else, the special effects are mind-blowing, with journeys back and forth between the natural world and the microscopic. What a treat for the eyes!

","Ant Man: Movie Review.<br/><br/>Ant Man is a visually gorgeous movie with excellent performances and another beautiful small but big addition to Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ant Man is a small superhero delight. Marvel has done it once again. Ant Man is a movie about a small superhero but it is definitely a very big movie in terms of entertainment, humour and laughs, awesome character development, solid cast performances, awesome action scenes and an interesting story line. The direction of Peyton Reed is well crafted. <br/><br/>The movie looks visually stylish and some photo realistic visuals are perfectly created. CGI, VFX are also good and looks realistic. The movie also looks good in terms of 3D, the 3D aspect of the movie is great. 3D scenes are handled very excellently and some scenes of small Ant Man in 3D are best. Also, Special Mention to the Excellent Screenplay and Story by: Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd.<br/><br/>The performances are great. Especially the performances of Main Characters are very well performed. Paul Rudd has done a fantastic job as the character of Ant Man. Evangeline Lilly as the character of Hope Van Dyne is brilliant and Michael Douglas has done a superb job in portraying the character of Hank Pym with his incredible talent and excellency. But best thing of the movie is Michael Peña and his very awesome amazing super fantastic performance in the terms of humour and as a supporting character. He is one of the many best thing in the movie. His humour comic timing is excellent and feels very realistic.<br/><br/>Ant Man has some flaws and issues also.The major flaw of the movie is a weak villain- the main negative character. The main villain character of the movie that is Yellowjacket is underdeveloped character and feels to be very rushed off. Corey Stoll as the main villain character of Yellowjacket is OK but not very impressive and his character feels very under utilized. There are also some underwhelming unnecessary characters which are not properly explored and they feel just like some plot devices to the story. Some scenes and certain sub plots are not properly structured.<br/><br/>On a special note: Stay for mid and post credit scenes. They are really awesome. And there are lots and tons of references to past and future Marvel Shared Cinematic Universe Movies–through out the Ant Man movie. Ant Man: Movie Ends the Marvel's second phase with a Bang!<br/><br/>(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others.

"EthanBJones_03","8","0","0","29 June 2017"," Baskin Robins ALWAYS Find out
","'ANT-MAN' was directed by Peyton Reed, should have been directed by Edgar Wright and stars Paul Rudd, Corey Stroll and Michael Douglas.​ Decades ago, Hank Pym(Michael Douglas) made the Pym Particle, a special formula that could shrink a human being to the size of an insect. He kept his research a secret for many years but when his old protégé is closing in on the formula, Pym employs Scott Lang(Paul Rudd), an ex-convict and thief to don his suit and steal the formula from his protégé before it's too late.<br/><br/>Damn. I don't wanna work in Baskin Robins now man... I don't need them seeing my life. Weird product placement(I guess?) aside, Ant- Man is a thoroughly enjoyable addition to the MCU and is a refreshing change of pace from what we're used to. Instead of being a standard Action movie, Ant-Man has evolved into a heist movie and takes the leap perfectly. The heist element(a product of Wright's genius I am sure) made the movie infinitely better than it should have been. I've always liked Paul Rudd, he seems like a nice guy, but I've never truly seen him shine before this movie. He pulls of Lang perfectly and I can definitely see this getting him more roles. Michael Douglas supports Rudd and does his role exceptionally well as Hank Pym. His dry tone and sometimes sarcastic mannerisms made him a perfect mentor for Scott and made him a memorable character. My main complaint is with the villain but I will address that in greater detail further along.<br/><br/>The story for this movie is alright. What makes it entertaining is the heist element and the heist alone. Without the heist, this movie would have been flat and have blurred in with the remained of the MCU for me. One thing I will say has been lacking from many MCU movies is powerful and impactful moments. Not saying they never happened but this movie tried to do some properly. Alas, they failed at this. They make a joke midway through a powerful scene and acknowledging it mid scene doesn't make the fact you ruined a good scene go away, it just puts it to the forefront of most people's minds. Not to say it was a bad joke, I just think they should have left it alone. Straight before or straight after - I don't care. Just don't ruin a scene that was working which I cheap gag for laughs.<br/><br/>As previously stated, Rudd and Douglas do exceptionally well so I won't comment any further. Also stated previously was my dislike of the villain, Darren Cross. Corey did a perfectly passable performance as Cross but where he falters is how one note he is. The character is just a mad, evil genius with no layers or interesting motivations. He was very dull and is this movie's main downfall. I don't know much about the Ant-Man comics but, if he is like this in the comics, they should have chosen another villain that had more meaning. Another weakness of the movie for me was Evangaline Lily as Hope. I didn't buy her performance, her character but most importantly I didn't buy the romance between her and Scott. It just felt unnatural and wasn't earned. They could have made a fun, romantic-comedy esc side-plot and even poked fun at that in the movie but they just go for a bland montage that doesn't effectively convey the character's emotions and feeling. Michael Pena's Luis could have come across as an annoying time waster but didn't. It's very hard to make the comic relief work in a movie and I think Pena did it brilliantly.<br/><br/>This is a technically proficient movie and it looks fine but I bet it would be a technical Marvel if Feige kept his grubby paws of Wright's neck and eventually fired him. The effects for this movie are marvellous. I believe that they used miniatures for major segments in this movie. That is not only inventive but also a very refreshing change in pace from the standard CGI fest. Not to say there is no CGI but when it's used it's used very well.<br/><br/>This movie made me laugh, the heist was interesting, the action was top notch. If I had to poke one other flaw it would be a certain cameo towards the middle which I believe should have been cut from the movie entirely. Aside from these flaws, Ant-Man is a very fun ride and I definitely want to know where these films go. I'll rate it 8 Weird A$$ Looking Dogs out of 10."
"mistoppi","8","0","0","27 May 2017"," More relaxed than others, very entertaining
","Ant-Man? Marvel isn't making movies about the actually interesting heroes, but we get a movie about Ant-Man? <br/><br/>I was very suspicious when Ant-Man was announced. Who actually gave a chicken-s@#t about Ant-Man? However my mind changed once I learned Edgar Wright was one of the writers. I've liked his style so, you know, even if Ant-Man had been total rubbish, at least there was some skillful writing - not just from Wright.<br/><br/>The most distinct thing about Ant-Man is how much simpler it is compared to the massive Avengers franchise. The story is simple, mostly revolving around a heist instead of some huge, epic fight that will cause millions of dollars worth of damage to the cities. It's simple, yet still interesting enough to watch. <br/><br/>Another special thing about Ant-Man is how much more relaxed it seems. There's no giant need to make it super serious and stuff a lot of philosophical pondering in there, which usually does go to total waste when it comes to superhero movies. Ant-Man is an action comedy, and it usually manages to make even the most important fights quite funny in rather easy ways. Ant-Man does a way better job at making the situation lighter than, say, Avengers: Age of Ultron, where they just zing kind of cheesy one-liners here and there to get cheap laughs from the audience. Could it be because writers of Avengers are working under this huge pressure and they can't really enjoy themselves, while reaction to Ant-Man being announced was pretty much ""Why the f@#k would you make this movie?""<br/><br/>Of course there are annoyances, which are too common with any superhero movies, and they get recycled over and over again. There's that unnecessary romance, predictable structure, but what's most annoying to me is you can't really watch a Marvel movie unless you've seen like at least three others. I'd love to be able to watch Ant-Man as Ant-Man, because it's actually funny movie, but there's hint to movies I haven't seen, and I don't want to watch. This is the biggest problem with the franchise system - you can't just watch movies individually. Like sure I wouldn't watch Iron Man 3 without seeing the first two, but like this is the first Ant-Man movie and still I have to know so much? It's a buzzkill.<br/><br/>All in all Ant-Man is a very entertaining movie, but it has the same flaws every superhero movie has. Thankfully though it's hilarious and way more relaxed than any other superhero movie I've seen - apart from Deadpool, of course."

","Finally I decided it is time to review the film ,which you can't tell the title with out chuckle a bit , because it seems so outrageous and silly and yet and yet the Marvel Studios still made a decent film out of it and bring one of the original Avengers on the big screen ,despite the lack of size ( ;)).<br/><br/>So in the film we follow Scot Lang ,who is recruited by Hank Pim ,the original Ant- man in order to help him steal his plans of how to change a persons or things size. Add to the mix add some nice slap-stick , Corey Stoll as the antagonist and you have your movie ,which by all the marvel films so far I feel it as the most family friendly of them all, like the Home Alone or Honey I shrank the kids of the MCU. And that is by no means bad ,I actually believe it is good that MCU can make and films like that. <br/><br/>Up to 2015 we had seen already ,WW2 film (First Avenger) ,Space Opera (Guardians of the Galaxy) , the technology genius (Iron Man) ,films about Gods (Thor) and not one but two big team ups (Avengers). In short ,yes the film feels like that has similarities with Iron-man but they are superficial at best. <br/><br/>Also if you are inept in the comic history ,you know dear reader ,that Ant-man from the comics has the most mixed and controversial story from all the Avengers. So to watch a film about him ,been both faithful to the premise and in all honesty removing the parts which no-one want to see it was a pleasure and gave me quite a lot respect to the creating team.<br/><br/>All in all if I have to compare the newest man with a power-suit with the original I would say that Ant-man is better than Iron-Man 2 and 3, but still far behind the first film. So buy or rent it and watch with the whole family."

","I guess I owe Peyton Reed an apology. I wasn't entirely right in saying Ant-Man was going to be bad. In fact, I had a lot of fun with it. I loved how small-scale the movie was, and Paul Rudd was great here. His arc is predictable, sure, but he does a good job giving the character some personality where the script failed to do so. Rudd is a guy who I love to watch in movies, so seeing him get his ""big break"" here is personally awesome for me and honestly would have been even if the movie wasn't good.<br/><br/>However, I had some serious issues with the movie. Now, whenever the film really honed in on the ""heist"" aspect of the story, it worked. But, the MCU references bring the film to a screeching halt. One scene in particular (spoiled by the ads, so I'll talk about it) involves the lead having to steal something for Pym, only to find out the base where this technology is at is actually an Avengers base. This leads to a completely unnecessary and out-of-place fight between Ant-Man and Falcon. Yeah, it was kind of cool, but man, forced doesn't even begin to describe how this scene felt. This is something that definitely wasn't in Edgar Wright's original script.<br/><br/>Speaking of Wright, Peyton Reed does try to mimic Wright every so often, and I wish he hadn't. The montage scene early on with Michael Pena worked, but the fast cuts and other montages similar to what you'd see in Wright's films just don't. You really shouldn't try to imitate other directors, especially one as visually distinct as Wright. Thankfully, Reed doesn't fall back on his style often and has his own voice, even if it is more mainstream.<br/><br/>As a whole, though, Ant-Man is a fun movie that is refreshingly small, but ultimately gets bogged down whenever it tries to tie itself to Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Which is a shame, especially knowing that with Wright at helm, it would have definitely been more of a standalone feature and it probably would have been even better."

","No, you read the title correctly – this isn't a review of Robert Downey Jr's first outing as the man IN steel. This is a review of Paul Rudd's turn as the titular 'Ant-Man' – yet another entry in the – seemingly – never ending 'Marvel Cinematic Universe.' Basically, Marvel has a formula where you have (a) (conflicted) hero (b) incident giving him superpowers (c) nemesis who happens to be the sort of bad version of himself. Now, before any Marvel fans jump down my throat and point out that NUMEROUS superheroes follow this template – I know this. DC and various independent efforts have all done this, right back from their comic origins. However, no other franchise is this prominent and turns out one film so quickly after the next, making it hard to forget what's come only just a year or so before.<br/><br/>'Ant-Man' follows Paul Rudd's character who's a down on his luck ex thief, freshly-released from prison, who gets more than he bargained for when he steals a top secret suit which allows him to shrink down to the size of an ant, along with all the benefits of super speed and strength which goes with it. Now, first of all many people wondered whether Rudd would pull this off. Typically, he's been known for his romantic comedies, rather than his action films (let alone leading man status). I'm pleased to say he did well. He brings a lot of humour to the role without making it an outright comedy, often poking fun at the genre, not to mention the general ludicrousness of being known as 'Ant-Man.' Besides, the typically forgettable villain that Marvel films seem to be known for (whenever Loki's not trying to take over the universe) we have Michael Douglas as the Obi-wan/mentor role to Rudd's fledgling superhero. I was delighted to see him back on the screen again as it seems like a long time since he's been at the forefront of the industry and he brings the charm he used to exhibit back in the nineties to the proceedings. Yes, there's a love interest in there, too and some 'comic relief' characters who you won't be able to remember their names once the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>Then, once the cast is assembled, they proceed to go on what is effectively Marvel's take on a 'heist movie,' i.e. think 'Ocean's Eleven' but with more insects. Did I mention Ant-Man can also control ants? Well, he can. This leads to – in my opinion – is one of the film's only real let-downs – the special effects. Now, for ninety per cent of the film the effects are up there with what you'd come to expect from a big budget film. It's just sometimes the insects do look a little 'drawn on' after the footage has been filmed. I guess I should just forgive this on account of how unfeasible it would be to train an army of bugs to put in a convincing performance (although, saying that – didn't Disney do that in 'A Bug's Life?).<br/><br/>So, 'Ant-Man' hardly reinvents the wheel in terms of cinema or its genre. However, its biggest flaw is also its strongpoint. It goes with the 'winning formula.' It certainly feels like a modern Marvel movie and, when you hold it up closely to others like 'Iron Man' and 'The Hulk,' you'll see that it copies them practically beat for beat. Normally, this would feel like a let-down, but when it copies something so good and just so happens to be such great fun in the process, I really can't bring myself to hate this film as much as I might have wanted to. Ant-Man will never be as big as Iron Man or Captain America, but this film's existence (and success!) proves that there is scope for the lesser-known heroes to also shine. Don't think too hard about this film, just break out the popcorn and enjoy. Oh, and apparently Ant-Man WILL return!"

","Ant-man has a different tone and style to all the other Marvel films. It is surprisingly entertaining and has a marvelous balance between comedy, action, and drama. With an over-complicated plot that relies too much on coincidence, the believability is questionable at times. And like the other marvel superhero films, the villain has no character depth, and is very card-board. Rudd is the perfect choice for Ant-Man, and Douglas and Lilly were fine supporting roles. The movie had some cute and enjoyable tie-ins with the greater realm of Marvel, and has enough references and teases to be a true part of the Marvel universe without being overbearing or obvious to the point of cringe."

","I can't say I've ever had any interest in Ant-Man as a comics reader, so I wasn't chomping at the bit for the movie version. And it's a mixed bag, but I do like the heist movie angle. And when the movie's actually about the titular hero, it's some good fun. There's imagination in the effects, and some solid laughs in shrinking the big superhero fights down to a small level. But the villain was much more interesting when he was named Obadiah Stane, and the tone of the movie was oddly (overly) morose during the Douglas/Lilly portion of the story. And the subatomic sequence was iffy.<br/><br/>Honestly, it's the story. Ant-Man was featured in ""Civil War"" for what, 5 minutes, and he was the movie's highlight. I think I was spoiled by the more comic tone of his appearance in that movie, and I wasn't expecting such a sullen outing here. At any rate, bottom line, this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as enjoyable as it is without Paul Rudd. He is thoroughly likable and honestly what makes all of this work.

","2015's ""Ant-Man"" is a superhero movie with a complicated production history that also manages to be an odd mix of superhero action, heist movies, and high-tech spy-thrillers.<br/><br/>Edgar ""Shaun of the Dead"" Wright and Joe ""Attack the Block"" Cornish had labored for several years on trying to bring Marvel Comics' size-changing superhero/genius scientist Ant-Man (co-created by Stan Lee, his younger brother Larry Lieber, and the legendary Jack Kirby) to the big screen. They eventually parted ways with Marvel, and Peyton Reed ended directing the final version of the film, with Adam McKay writing the screenplay (that was taken over from Wright and Cornish) that was released theatrically in 2015.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is the 12th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and while it's connected to the MCU, it still feels separated from it in some way (sort of like how 2016's ""Deadpool"" is). And even if ""Ant-Man"" still feels like an MCU superhero movie, it doesn't exactly follow the typical superhero movie formula that's become so familiar over the years.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest change from type is the fact that this movie has a much heavier emphasis on the use of humor (though the film itself is not necessarily parody - but it certainly doesn't take itself very seriously), and the fact that its hero, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, who also worked on McKay's script), is a criminal who's desperately trying to go straight after doing three years in San Quentin for burglary.<br/><br/>Yes, in the original comics, Lang (who was created by David Michelinie, who wrote my favorite Iron Man story ""Iron Man: Demon in a Bottle,"" and John Byrne), who became the second Ant-Man, was a burglar who pulled off a heist to save his sick daughter and in the process crossed paths with Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym, the first Ant-Man - who then passed off the mantle to Lang.<br/><br/>In the big-budget film adaptation, the aging Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas) has already had his time in the spotlight as the first Ant-Man, who possessed technology that allowed him to change his size and communicate with insects (i.e., ants), and passes the mantle onto Scott Lang after Lang is released from prison. Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), need Lang's help to pull off yet another daring heist. But this heist is not some simple criminal scheme to get rich off of stolen goods, but is to save the world. (And there is even an appearance from MCU regular Sam Wilson/The Falcon - played by Anthony Mackie - in the middle of the film.)<br/><br/>It turns out that Pym's former protégé Darren Scott (Corey Stoll) is close to replicating Pym's technology, but has militarized it and plans to sell it on the black market in the hopes of making billions off of it. So Lang becomes the second Ant-Man in order to stop Scott, who eventually becomes the super-villain Yellowjacket and who possesses many of the same powers that Lang does.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is a movie that I was initially very wary of seeing, based largely on what I was reading in the news about its production history (usually not a good sign, especially when you consider the fact that Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish were once involved), and the fact that it wasn't really focusing on the original Ant-Man. To their credit, Paul Rudd was a suitable lead as Scott Lang. I liked how they portrayed Lang as a criminal trying to go straight, but keeps getting lured back into old habits. I also just liked how the naturally comedic Rudd doesn't take the role all that seriously, which makes him stand out from other notable superhero characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; just watch him in this year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) for details.<br/><br/>To my surprise, ""Ant-Man"" is a surprisingly entertaining superhero entry into the MCU about a zero who becomes an unlikely hero, saves the world, and manages to get the girl in the end.<br/><br/>8/10"

","A simple story with no major twists and turns , an affable feel, and traditional good vs evil elements reproduced ad verbatim , Ant Man is a well made movie .

In fact the movie for its day and age is uncharacteristically clean . There are only few gross scenes , but nothing remotely as seriously objectionable for young audiences as you would find in Deadpool . <br/><br/>If you are expecting the in vogue super hero-pretentious stuff ( superheroes with grey shades and philosophy) , you will w=be disappointed .

","Well, it started all the same like any other movie. Paul Rudd did a pretty decent job throughout the whole movie. He never claimed to be a hero, yet he was smart, comical and a good father. We can say he was a hero for his daughter. On the other, the amusingly peculiar thing in this movie is the act of Michael Pena, he was totally a dope. I've never seen this part of him (maybe cause I've not seen much of his movies). He is the only guy who's gonna crack you up.

","First of all I have to confess to not being a fan of Marvel Comic movies. I know some people are very much into the genre, but a lot of the Marvel movies leave me somewhat cold. Having said that I have to confess that I certainly enjoyed Ant Man.<br/><br/>The thing that was personally enjoyable to me was the fact that Ant Man is a very fallible character. I will leave it to everybody to discover what his powers are, but the title of the movie gives a bit of a clue. I have to say that I like Paul Rudd as an actor and he is certainly very good in this movie as the lead character Scott Lang or Ant Man. You certainly feel very involved with the characters of the movie and the time fairly zips along.<br/><br/>The credits at the end of the movie leave an opening for a sequel and it's certainly one that I will look forward to."
"FloodClearwater","8","4","12","23 August 2015"," Small Talk About Marvel's Big Hearted Change of Pace
","Marvel comic books were hardly monolithic. Each title had a mood of its own, and dozens of asides, discursives, and idioms sprouted from one serialized issue to the next. The Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, good as they are, struggle to convey this 'stubble' due to their two-hours-every-two years format. <br/><br/>Ant Man delivers some tasty stubble, and solid stand-alone superhero origin storytelling, even if it is, inescapably, a much 'smaller' project than an Avengers: Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd acts brilliantly, his natural, likable yet magnetic everyman posture is in full effect. Rudd's character, a good hearted but unlucky burglar, fresh out of San Quentin, is armed with three ex-con buddies, and they are funny, fresh, and a welcome change in style from the lycra dolts marking time next to Nick Fury in the recent Marvel installments. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas plays Hank Pym, a scientist and (retiring) hero to rival Tony Stark and his father. Pym ""discovers"" Rudd's cockeyed optimist protagonist, ""Scott."" Pym's rival, played by the ascendant Corey Stoll, is Darren Cross, an inventor-mogul wanting to dip toes into the international bad guy business.<br/><br/>Rudd, Douglas, and Stoll make all the dramatic stops, and the production team has fun tweaking the noses of Avengers fans with a naughty 'Capital A' action sequence depicting Scott figuring out the new moves he can make while suited up. <br/><br/>Because this is the 'small' film in Marvel's current phase, the film gets into the whimsical worlds of children and animals, and while these moments are also well executed and story-appropriate, the overall effect is to make the film a bit more cuddly, a la Toy Story, than dyed in the wool Marvel maniacs might prefer.<br/><br/>Rudd is on perfect form here, and Ant Man is a high quality if offbeat super hero flick."
"dnel-s","7","4","12","22 July 2015"," A great ton of fun, for a tiny hero!
","Ant-Man.<br/><br/>Marvel has no limits. First a talking raccoon, and now a movie about a the ''Ant-man''. Marvel proves once again that even the stupidest idea can be made into a fun as hell movie. The movie is about Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a cat burglar who is chosen by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to become the new Ant-Man. Look, I could tell you more, but at this point, you either know who Ant-man is and what he is about, or you just a regular movie goer. Either way you are going to have a blast with this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining, funny and action-packed! The cinematography is excellent, this is a really good looking movie with some excellent camera angels and CGI. The acting is great, I has very impressed by Paul Rubb and the way he sold me his character. Michael Douglas also gives an outstanding performance as the emotional father. I can't forget to mention Michael Pena as the comic-relief, he was great as well, even though every one has their moments.<br/><br/>There are rumors that Edgar Wright left this movie because he didn't wan't to connect this to the other Marvel movie, if that is the cause, then good thing he left (call me out on it if that rumors is bullshit). Cause this is the non-Avengers Marvel movie that actually manages to connect the MCU without stopping the whole movie just the say ''Hey, remember Iron man 3 and that thing that happened in the last Thor movie, huh, huh, we do know about those thing''. This movie has a flow where everything fits perfectly, and thing from other Marvel movie can be mentions naturally. Ant-Man is a great finisher for Marvels phase 2.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is great. In my opinion it is the best Marvel superhero movie since the original Avengers. Whether you are a comic-book person, superhero fan or just a regular person who likes to have fun, you will like this movie and have a lot of fun . I have tried to hold back on telling you anything about the plot, because it is best to go in blind, knowing nothing other than what the hell Ant-Man is supposed to be. I did, and I had a blast."
"dvoon-missy-mcmuffin","6","4","12","19 July 2015"," Kinda enjoyable watch
","This was definitely much better than Age of Ultron, but it was no where close to what Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy had - those were fresh without relying on ""proven"" formula.<br/><br/>Reasons being, there were so much clichés and predictability in the 1st half of it: Such as the compliment given to him before he was fired from his job. The montages of training. The result of the keyhole training. The rejection of the sugar cube from the ants. The almost identical 1-dimensional-alter-ego-villain from Iron Man 1. The heist gone wrong towards the final arc - to name a few.<br/><br/>Then there were situations that boggles my mind during the Falcon fight. Granted the fight was done well, but i kept asking myself, where are the other shield employees in the Avengers HQ throughout that scene? Not that of the Avengers themselves, but the agents, workers of any kind. It was just him and Falcon fighting on an empty area of a warehouse-like-parking-lot-feel with an ""A"" painted on its roof. And yet that scene had Falcon constantly reporting the situation to someone. But no one bothered to come help when there was a breech in Avengers HQ.<br/><br/>It seemed like Marvels so-called cinematic universe only serves as a cinematic universe on certain areas when they deem necessary. And they ignore other aspects of it that were establish from other past films (most of these inconsistencies were started after IM3).<br/><br/>With that said, it was still an enjoyable film amidst some of my negativity towards it. There were aspects that were creative such as the ""flashbacks of news"" that were narrated by Michael Pena. The fighting in his daughter's room, where it felt like it hurts but were actually plastic toys being thrown. And of course the ants.<br/><br/>I doubt i would give it multiple viewings though."
"ThomasDrufke","7","4","12","16 July 2015"," Small Hero, Bigger Universe
","Part of the brilliance of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is how they are able to seamlessly weave the stories together and connect our heroes into one giant story. Ant-Man manages to bring Marvel's smallest hero to life and further the universe/galaxy into an even more thrilling place. I really enjoyed the film. I found it to be one of Marvel's funniest pictures, which is no surprise when you have Adam McKay and Paul Rudd co-writing the script. I thought the action and unique fight scenes were well done. There's a ton to like about Ant-Man, and it's another solid outing for the studio. But I also unfortunately think it's is one of the weaker films Marvel has done. That's not to say I don't think Ant-Man is a good film, I do. I think it's really good, but it's not great. Especially after the last 3 films Marvel had done were Avengers 2, Guardians, and Cap 2. Three near perfect superhero films in my book.<br/><br/>Ant-Man tells the story of Scott Lang, an ex-con who just needs a second chance in order to prove to his daughter that he's worth something. That's the part of the film I really enjoyed. I like that this film is at it's core a father-daughter story. For both Scott and Hank, they are trying to prove to their daughters that they aren't washed up bums. Hank gives Scott a chance at redemption by training him to be the Ant-Man, in order to help save the world from Darren Cross' ugly ideas. Cross plays Yellowjacket, and the main villain of the film. The Yellowjacket scenes were pretty cool and much more entertaining than the trailers led me to believe, but I wasn't really a fan of Corey Stoll's performance as Cross. Perhaps it's because his character is way too similar to Jeff Bridges' character in the first Iron man, or maybe it's because the script just doesn't add depth to him. No matter, I thought that was one of the more glaring weaknesses, and a hero is only as good as it's villain. In terms of our hero, I loved Paul Rudd's performance. He's always been great at pulling off both drama and comedy, and Scott Lang was no different for him. I loved that it never seemed like he or the cast were taking the film too seriously, which is something Guardians also did really well. In these big superhero films, it's important to understand the scope and even the utter ridiculousness of the stories. I mean this film is called Ant-Man for crying out loud.<br/><br/>If we're talking about Ant-Man's buddies, I'll admit I wasn't as grossed out as I thought I would be by all the ants in this film. And I was a little hurt when Scott's main buddy, Anthony, kicked the bucket, something I never thought I would say about an Ant. But I wasn't sold on Hope, as both a character and as Evangeline Lilly's performance. There was an opportunity for a great character here, and perhaps there still is in the future (after credits scene), but I never felt connected to her at any point. Her emotional scenes are carried by Michael Douglas, who was brilliant, and her sassy lines come off really b*tchy. Of course, they have to push her for a love interest to Scott, which always felt awkward, as the chemistry was just not there. But the fact that she's pretty much becoming the Wasp, makes me have hope for the character. but overall, if we're just talking about her in this role, I found her to be kind of off-putting and unlikable, but that's just me. Onto the comedy, Michael Pena absolutely kills it. He's by far the funniest part of the movie and quite possibly of the entire cinematic universe. It would be fun to see him interact with some of the Avengers. Most of Scott's buddies hit the mark with their comedy, and speaking of the Avengers, man was that Falcon scene awesome. I was spoiled with him being in the film by a stupid TV spot, but I was impressed to see him have such a notable role and it never felt out of place. It was also nice to briefly see John Slattery and Hayley Atwell reprise their MCU roles.<br/><br/>So with Ant-Man being hilarious and imposing further implications on the universe, I was pleased with the outcome. It's not one of Marvel's better films and it has way too many plot conveniences and a few clichés here and there, but the film is still enjoyable. I just wish the film felt more special then it ended up feeling. The story is weird, but Guardians felt like nothing I have ever experienced. While the action is different then any Marvel film, I don't think the story built around it was all that special. It was also probably the most predictable of any Marvel film to date. Nevertheless, go see it, and stay for both credits scenes, because they are killer.<br/><br/>+Douglas & Rudd kill it <br/><br/>+Pena is hilarious <br/><br/>+Falcon scene <br/><br/>+Beginning cameos <br/><br/>-Hope <br/><br/>-Villain doesn't have much depth <br/><br/>7.7/10"
"Vivekmaru45","7","3","8","21 August 2015"," The Last Michael Douglas Film I Saw Was David Fincher's The Game(1997).
","After 18 years, I'm seeing him act again at age 71. Though he has aged, his acting remains top-notch. In fact Douglas carries the weight of the whole film on his shoulders, as one of the veteran actors in the cast. In my youth I've seen many of his films, some of which are cult classics.<br/><br/>So there we have it, Ant-man finally comes out of his comic book into a live action full-length feature film. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, Ant-Man's first appearance was in Tales to Astonish #27 (January 1962). <br/><br/>The plot device of the film is a chemical substance (Pym Particles) that would allow the user to alter his size. Armed with a helmet that could control ants, the user wears a regulated suit that employed the physics of the Pym particle, and would shrink down to the size of an insect, preferably to that of an ant. Hence Ant-man is born. <br/><br/>Brief plot: In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his own company. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym.<br/><br/>Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. While visiting his daughter Cassie unannounced, Lang is rebuked by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect.<br/><br/>See the film to find out what happens next...<br/><br/>Verdict: the point of seeing any film of this sort in ""big-screen"" is because of the special effects. These days the computer is evolving so fast, that someday I believe it will be implanted inside a living human being. Right now, it is in the virtual reality(VR) phase. You wear some goggles and some gloves and boom, you are transplanted into another world. VR differs from conventional computing because of the enormity of perception between the two. <br/><br/>The special effects in this film are very good. The plot, I feel is too immature and childlike in its conception. Serious movie-lovers and Grownups will not find it appealing, however children, persons in their early teens and casual movie-goers will like it. Paul Rudd is so much similar to actor Ben Affleck, that I first thought it was Ben who was in the film. Paul plays the titular character Ant-man. Paul's acting in decent, however he fails to stamp his authority in the film, maybe because of the dull script. Evangeline Lilly will be a familiar figure to viewers of the TV series Lost. Corey Stoll plays the villainous Darren Cross (a.k.a. Yellowjacket). His acting is decent, but yet again the script could have afforded him a better portrayal of his role.<br/><br/>More Michael Douglas Films To See/Buy: The Star Chamber 1983, Romancing the Stone 1984 and sequel The Jewel of the Nile 1985, Fatal Attraction 1987(most controversial film of that year and a modern remake of the Clint Eastwood-Jessica Walter film Play Misty For Me), Black Rain 1989, The War of the Roses 1989, Basic Instinct 1992(highly controversial film because of the sex scenes portrayed by actress Sharon Stone), Falling Down 1993(One of the most enigmatic and powerful performances by Michael Douglas. Directed by Joel Schumacher), Disclosure 1994, The Ghost and the Darkness 1994(simply put: Unmissable). These are all the Michael Douglas films I have seen, but there are many other films of his I haven't seen.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review. May you live long and prosper."

","Somewhat off topic to begin in this review, I have to say that some people should have to earn a learner's permit to express their opinion on the internet. That having been said, it's time for me to ""Ride Home"" about this movie. <br/><br/>First off, I have to say that, like most people that have seen Paul Rudd in almost anything he's been in at all, I can't not love the guy. I mean, come on, ""slappin' da bass, man,"" and ""60% of the time, it works every time."" He's funny, he's intelligent funny, but he's also goofy funny, and he's an excellent ad lib. Not to mention that he had a hand in the re-writes of the script after Wright left. <br/><br/>Since I'm on the subject of Edgar Wright... Would Ant-Man have been better if Wright had been able to swallow throwing in a Falcon cameo, and swapping out ten- rings for hydra buyers? It probably would have been, but we'll never know.

"Shengalang","8","3","8","16 August 2015"," If you've always been a marvel movie fan, then you will like this one as well!
","I'm looking at all these reviews on IMDb and I see that literally every review has around 50% down votes. I think people are mostly divided on their views for this movie; some people complained about the fight scenes while others complimented the CGI and vice versa. I was hesitant to go see it after reading the reviews, but I shoved all those negative thoughts out of my head and went regardless. <br/><br/>I'm really glad that I went. I wasn't a huge fan of Marvel and DC superheroes at first – I'm more of an anime/manga lover, but over the years all these superhero movies grew on me and I've since caught up on all of them. I went into this movie knowing basically nothing about the background of Ant-Man and I followed along with the plot just fine. The movie describes Ant-man's humble beginnings very well and I'm sure that kids of all ages will be able to follow along with the plot just fine. <br/><br/>This movie is meant for people of all ages, but if you ask me, I think it's leaning just a little bit towards the younger generation. If I remember correctly (it's been awhile since I've last seen the movie), I don't think there were any nudity or sex scenes. The jokes definitely feel like Marvel jokes; light-hearted, fast pace, quick- wit, and really capitalizing on ""cool"" moments. <br/><br/>I personally thought that the action scenes and CGI were phenomenal. People underestimate how hard it is to make a unique character such as Ant-Man work on the big screen and I think they did a fantastic job. The fight scenes are very innovative, his transformations during the fights opens up a lot of possibility and brings variety to the table. The supporting casts were great as well; Michael Pena tried way too hard to be funny, but it still came out alright. Evangeline Lilly played Hope PERFECTLY. I really like her in this role and I'm glad they are initiating her into the marvel universe.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are the type of person that really likes the Marvel movie franchises, then I think you should give this movie a chance. I really liked it and I'm sure most of you will too."

Paul Rudd is the appropriate hero as the title character who shrinks and goes back to normal in one quick beat.

Evangeline Lilly is the daughter of Douglas' character who also wants in on the action. All I'll say now is I highly recommend Ant-Man."
"RemusGrey","8","4","13","24 July 2015"," Ant-Man is a fun and successful MCU entry
","I don't know why I liked this film so much. It seems like another Guardians of the Galaxy film, but a better Marvel tie-in and more awesome story! This small hero's film may be short and have a small box office (which is not that important), but the film made itself a fun and successful MCU entry.<br/><br/>The movie has more focus on a new Ant-Man with the first Ant-Man being present as an old character. We also focus on new characters like Hope van Dyne instead of her mother Janet van Dyne (also known as The Waps) who has (presumably) died while joining Hank Pym on a mission, Darren Cross who is Scott Lang's first enemy (though he was working with a younger Hank Pym). It has a ""reboot feeling"", but this idea from Marvel was a great idea. Surprisingly, unlike Age of Ultron, has a fewer city destruction (in this film, a building blows up and shrinks) and a lighter tone (though it was 15% percent darker than Guardians of the Galaxy), yet the story is well done. Darren Cross was kind of underdeveloped but even his alter ego, the Yellowjacket, was a more menacing villain than Ultron. Ultron's evil plan was just to destroy the world. That's it? Kind of stupid, eh? Leave it to the Yellowjacket who was more menacing and his evil plan was to take over Hank Pym's company and destroy everyone Scott Lang cares for. That doesn't seem too menacing, but his attitude is really menacing. <br/><br/>Let's move on to the acting. Paul Rudd is as awesome and likable as his character Scott Lang. Michael Douglas as usual, has an impressive acting. Evangeline Lily who will be the new Wasp (as revealed in the mid-credits scene) was much better in her martial arts training. Corey Stroll who plays a menacing villain indeed is menacing in his role. Michael Peña who has a familiar voice and face (I felt like he played a character in Turbo) has a comedy role and seriously was the funny one.<br/><br/>Ant-Man was better than Age of Ultron. It is just like Guardians of the Galaxy with a 5% darker tone, yet very light. Age of Ultron wasn't better than the first one but was still fun. But Ant-Man was such a big improvement that it ended up being more fun and better than Age of Ultron. Again, this is just like Guardians of the Galaxy, but the only similar things about the two are the light tones and comedy. Guardians of the Galaxy was a big success. And this little hero has become a successful Marvel film. Yes, it does also feel like another Iron Man too, but Iron Man's tone is still dark. Iron Man 2 ended up OK, but failed to be better than the first. The same happened to Age of Ultron. Let's hope that the Ant-Man sequel will not end up like Age of Ultron. For now, all I can say on this verdict is this: Ant-Man is a fun and successful MCU entry. <br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>P.S. Unlike Age of Ultron, this film now has two bonus scenes! Make sure to stay for it."

However, after watching Reed's adaptation of the comic book, here I sit with my foot in my mouth. <br/><br/>The film begins in 1989, when Hank Pym (Douglas) – the original Ant- Man – leaves S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering that they are trying to copy his shrinking technology. In the present, Pym is kicked out of Pym Technologies by his own daughter, Hope (Lilly), and his malicious former apprentice, Darren Cross (Stoll). Meanwhile, Scott Lang (Rudd) has just been released from prison after his incarceration for burglary and has resolved to lead a clean life, much to the dismay of his roommate. With his criminal record, Scott has an impossible time getting even a minimum wage job. All he wants is to see his daughter, but his ex-wife Maggie (Greer) will only let him see her when he can pay child support. In desperation, Scott turns to his roommate Luis (Peña) and agrees to join his crew for a burglary that they've received a tip for. However, the tip only leads them to find a motorcycle suit. Later, Scott tries on the suit and accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an ant. Next thing he knows, Scott is the new Ant- Man and is on a team with Hope and Pym trying to stop Darren Cross from selling the shrinking technology to Hydra as weaponry – something that would have disastrous results for the world. <br/><br/>Most of the acting in Ant-Man is spot-on. The writers take advantage of Rudd's comedic pedigree and use him as comedic relief, along with Peña. Still, when seriousness is needed Rudd does come through with an emotional performance; he establishes for the audience the pain Scott feels over not being able be there for his daughter. Peña also gives a notable performance, with his character maintaining a goofy grin akin to Donald Faison's in Remember the Titans. Peña manages to keep the mood from getting too dark and provides the audience with lots of laughs. Lilly, however, does not make such a good addition to the cast. She reminded me too much of a clone of Bryce Dallas Howard in Jurassic World, for starters. Hope is written as a complex character with a tough exterior and a sense of pride to protect herself from being hurt by her father; she initially dislikes Scott because her father has chosen him as his predecessor over her. Lilly doesn't convey this; instead she spends half the movie as an obnoxious bully and then suddenly becomes compassionate and supportive of Scott. Such a dramatic character shift isn't believable.<br/><br/>Another problem I have with Ant-Man is some of the writing. Writers Joe Cornish and Edgar Wright use distasteful foreshadowing. The plot winds up being very predictable; there are no surprises in the film. Despite this, the storyline is still entertaining to an extent. Cornish and Wright also team up with Stoll to create an insufferable antagonist. Darren Cross is quite clearly evil with mal intent right off the bat. Again and again in the exposition, metaphorical neon signs that say ""I'M THE BAD GUY!"" point at Cross. It's excessive and the point is ridiculously over-emphasized. <br/><br/>Although the idea of an insect as a superhero is innovative, this particular story is quite overdone. Controlling and containing weapons is not exactly a new theme in this day and age. This certainly isn't Ant-Man's only lesson, but it is definitely the most central to the story. With no new or diverse angles on the message, this film will undoubtedly get lost with Marvel's other mediocre superhero flicks."

","Me and a friend had the opportunity of seeing an early screening of the movie Ant-man and wow! Finally! A fresh, out of the box movie which has all the best parts of Marvel fit into it. Finally, a superhero movie that really focuses on and showcases the super abilities of its protagonist so well that it makes you wish it existed in reality. By saying that, it doesn't mean the powers owned by the hero our too far fetched because Marvel did a really good job of making it as realistic as possible. The portrayal of the powers were done ingeniously! (A stunning amount of Macro lens usage!) The script was brilliant! Extremely entertaining! And you can definitely feel Edgar Wright's presence through out the film with added Paul Rudd humour which was so enjoyable (FYI: Paul Rudd scripted the film as well). Over all the movie was pretty Amazing and deserves a big screen! the story might be too formulaic but the execution was friggin awesome! And for the people who were let down by Age of ultron, this movie presents itself as a good apology from Marvel. P.S. stick around for an easter egg filled mid-credits and after credits scene!"

","The next evolution of the Marvel Cinematic Universe brings a founding member of The Avengers to the big screen for the first time with Marvel Studios' ""Ant-Man."" Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats. Against seemingly insurmountable obstacles. For once the bad buzz and worse trailers were wrong. This hero deserves a movie all his own. Pick a formula. Include a wonderful actor.

"KJackson-30","Null","3","9","19 July 2015"," It's not how you ride the ant, it's how you pull off the heist.
","Ant-Man, is a man who shrinks to a size of an ant, can control and ride ants, 'nough said. This is great beginning to what is hoped to be a few more (action, sci-fi, comedy) Ant-Man films to come. <br/><br/>The concept is good given that we are establishing a Marvel Comic character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now given that the heart of the premise was more of a heist movie, a Michael Mann/Frank Pierson embellishment would had been nice for Edgar Wright to have been inspired by on top of his Simon Pegg film style that was absent in Ant-Man, within the screenplay.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is defiantly a fan boy and girl film for all ages (although PG-13). Anyone who loves Ant-Man will love seeing him filmed on Panavision. For the non fans of comic books and comic book films this film is pretty much your Summer Blockbuster fair, though better than you would expect. Moreover, that famous comic book relationship between Scott and Hope will have to wait till Ant-man 2, unfortunately. <br/><br/>Ant-Man is definitely an original high-concept superhero for the big screen. Not since Lily Tomlin's Incredible Shrinking Woman, James Bolin's Fantastic Voyage, Meg Ryan's Innerspace, and best of all Rick Moranis' Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, have you had such fun watching a person shrink. A little trivia is that Ant-Man was not developed in the 80's due to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids being made at the time. Waiting twenty-five years for Ant-Man was a bit too long. <br/><br/>""This is your chance to earn that look in your daughters eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are,"" Hank says to Scott. The film's theme wasn't strong enough on the father/daughter relationship as Transformers was with a boy and his car. ""It's not about saving our world. It's about saving theirs,"" was touching line from Hank to Scott and essentially is what the movie was about even though it was weak in delivering that poignant message. Filmmakers state the theme is ""passing the torch,"" which is visible in watching Ant-Man as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, as a stand alone film the theme of 'second chances' seems to out-play the 'passing of the torch.' Moreover, subplots were fair to say the least; some Chinatown-esque subplots would had been nice the enrich the Pym's company premise. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was well done in true Marvel excellence. Kevin Feige is doing a fantastic job and the effort he puts towards these films is to be commended. The predictability, is to be desired, there are no twists and turns similar to those in other work by Edgar Wright. <br/><br/>The characters played well to the comic standards even though you won't be getting any Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) character richness that you would want in this family affair between Scott, Hope and Hank. The casting is superb, Paul Rudd could not had been casted any better; however, his background in the film needed more depth. Michael Pena was fantastic as the comedic relief. Most of all, seeing Michael Douglas in this role was perfect. Pierce Bronson, who was up for the role, would had had a different line on the character, which might have been fun too. Stan Lee's cameo is one of the best yet. Moreover, the villain, Darren Cross, was cookie-cutter and lackluster and is Bug-B-Gone'd by the movie's end.<br/><br/>The contemporary setting in San Francisco, where it was mainly shot, was fine, given that San Francisco seems to be in every major release this Summer, is getting a bit overused. Setting this movie in some other tax-incentive states other than Georgia (where it was also shot at Pinewood Studios) would be a nice change of scenery. Although, the production design was great location scouting in choosing Hank's home. Pym's facility wasn't half bad either. <br/><br/>The visual effects were fantastic. Without giving away spoilers, the ants will stand the test of time, the train set scene is realistically done and the Thomas Train is hilarious. The macro photography used in this film is a what made all the difference in this film being a great ride that we can all enjoy and don't feel we are in some animated world but instead in that of our own live-action world. Superb job! As was the great mime-esque stunts that were executed. The cinematography was done crisply by Russell Carpenter, who had a nod to his academy award-winning work for Titanic in the film with a few lines of jokes about the Titanic ship and movie. <br/><br/>While the story and screenplay is in part done by Edgar Wright, he was to direct before dropping due to ""creative differences."" While the film is well done, it does miss that Edgar Wright touch and it is quite noticeable and would had been a vastly different film than what is presented before us by Peyton Reed of Bring It On (and a few other romantic comedies). Perhaps, this was a bit too much to chew for Reed but he handled it well. Though much like Superman 2 (1980), there is a much added difference between the theatrical film and the Richard Donner cut DVD release. That same difference would apply here in having seen an Edgar Wright directed film. Here's hoping Edgar can be back for Ant-man 2, eh.<br/><br/>Overall: this is a great film to see up close and personal with or without the kids in tow but definitely a must watch now (in the theater) rather than later (i.e. Blu-Ray) type of film. Don't forget to stay till the very end of the credits, it'll be worth it."
"stevendbeard","8","3","9","17 July 2015"," Great, Humorous Super Installment In The Marvel Franchise
","I saw ""Ant-Man"", starring Paul Rudd-The Anchorman movies, Halloween:The Curse of Michael Myers; Michael Douglas-Last Vegas, Haywire; Evangeline Lilly-Lost_tv, Freddy vs. Jason; Corey Stoll-The Strain_tv, Salt and Michael Pena-Fury, Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>This is the newest super hero movie in the Marvel line of movies-and it is connected to them-and like most movie adaptations, there are a few minor changes from the comics. In the comics, Ant-Man was an original Avenger; one of 4, including the Hulk, Iron Man and Thor. Captain America did not even show up until issue #4. Michael D plays Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man and is shown in 1987 as a younger looking man-I guess they used CGI because he looks good-that invents his Pym Particles, a serum that can shrink and enlarge things, and oh yeah, he can communicate with ants with his helmet. Corey is his associate that has other ideas for the Pym Particles-he wants to sell it to the military, to make invincible soldiers. Of course, Michael D refuses and goes into retirement, taking the formula with him. Flash forward to the present, Paul-Scott Lang-plays a man getting out of prison for committing burglary, who just wants to go straight and reconnect with his young daughter. Problem is that no one likes to hire an ex-con, so he can not get a good job to pay child support to see his daughter-his wife insists that he needs to pay her to see his daughter. Michael P is Paul's best buddy and helps him out with a place to stay. Over the years, Corey has been working on perfecting the Pym serum with bad results, and Evangeline-Michael D's daughter-has been keeping an eye on Corey and reporting back to her dad. When Corey starts getting close to getting it right, Michael decides to enlist Paul as the new Ant-Man and put a stop to it. There is a lot of humor through out the movie, mostly thanks to Paul. There is a super hero fight with Ant-Man and an Avenger before the climatic battle of Ant-Man against Corey in his villainous Yellowjacket persona, near the end. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo and there are two scenes at the end; the first one is just as the end credits start and the second one is at the very end, after the end credits and it has two Avengers and Bucky in it, leading up to the next Captain America movie. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"reviewsbycaleb","8","3","9","17 July 2015"," Refrshingly Small
","Ant-Man was one of those movies that was almost hard to believe they were going to try to make into a movie. Even in the trailers they made fun of the name and predictably the general public followed. The buzz for this movie seemed minimal with friends and if anything was said about it, usually it came from a negative perspective. I had some hope for this film though, I think Paul Rudd is hilarious and the overall commitment to a more comedic cast, director and writers seemed like a promising fit for Marvel instead of action guys writing comic relief.<br/><br/>Ant-Man begins with a young Michael Douglas, playing Dr. Hank Pym, arguing with some members of SHIELD about an invention of his and him not sharing it with them. You find out early that his wife is dead and he has no intentions of letting SHIELD use his application, in fear of what could happen if it gets into the wrong hands. Then fast forward to present day, Scott Lang, who is in prison for burglary, (Rudd) gets released in a pretty amusing scene. You learn a great deal about the Lang character quickly. He has a daughter, with a women who is now engaged to a cop, and that he is not allowed to see her until he gets his life together and can pay his alimony. You learn more of his criminal activity that landed him in prison and the almost Robin Hood persona it follows. He gets a job and gets fired due to a background check and a struggle follows of Rudd's character trying to stay away from the life of crime, but wanting to be able to be in his daughter's life.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is absolutely perfect for this role and breaths a lot of life into this movie, same goes for Michael Douglas. The comedy to this point was pretty effective and invoked my laughs and the people around me in the theater. The movie was slow getting to the super hero part, but in hindsight I think that's a strength of Ant-Man because this worked better as a heist and unconventional super hero movie better than it would of as a grand scale typical Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Through struggles and pressures Scott Lang decided to do a heist his friend Luis, hilarious turn by Michael Peña, has set up and has been trying to get him to do. Showing his physical and intellectual skills, Lang gets in with ease but discovers instead of money or gold, their is a suit in the vault. Dr. Pym turns out to be recruiting Scott to be the new Ant-Man and tries to sell the idea to him as he tries on the suit and gets himself into a little trouble. Wanting nothing to do with this he returns the suit, breaking in again, but this time gets caught by the cops and sent to jail. At this point he has no options but to join Pym as he has a plan to bust him out of jail. Throughout the movie you get the antagonist Darren Cross, played by Corey Stoll (House of Cards), revealing he is getting close to achieving something similar Dr. Pym's technology, the Yellowjacket suit. This is why Pym is recruiting Rudd's character, to use him and his own Ant-Man suit to steal Cross's Yellowjacket suit before he sells it to some rather sketchy people.<br/><br/>As talked about earlier, the ant sized scope of this film is refreshing compared to the rest of the Marvel universe. Instead of the fight for the world on a grand scale you get an intimate fight with those same stakes in the background. The obviously coming ""climatic fight scene"" was also surprisingly original and had some interesting and new elements even thought the setting isn't what you would think of as an interesting setting for this type of movie's climax.<br/><br/>The humor overall was a strength of the movie and didn't take away from the dramatic elements as other Marvel films usually are guilty of. There were scenes were they used the same type of punch line over and over which got tedious and corny. Some of the dialogue in the fight scenes were also pretty comically bad and the villain Corey Stoll was a pretty poorly written and uninteresting character in my book. They tried something interesting with the effect the suit and science has on people involved that could of been developed into an interesting development for the Stoll character, but that was completely ditched and what we ended up with was a pretty Clichéd character.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is the best Marvel movie of the year, which is only a moderate accomplishment due to Age of Ultron being so average. With great humor comes great responsibility and overall the cast, writers, and director don't let down Uncle Ben's famous line that I just butchered to fit my review. The intimate scope is refreshing and daring for a Marvel franchise that has become obsessed with destroying whole cities with not much of a thought. Not great but absolutely good enough to catch in theaters for a fun ride following this unique super-hero.<br/><br/>Check out more of my reviews: http://reviewsbycaleb.com"
"cherold","6","2","5","9 May 2016"," Dumb but reasonably entertaining
","One of the problems with many superhero movies is there seems to be a philosophy from the producers that as long as you hit the clichés - evil mastermind, likable-but-flawed hero, a little conflict, a little comedy relief - then you don't need to worry about whether anything makes sense, or whether the characters are more than paper cutouts.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is a classic example of group-think, special-effects driven Hollywood entertainment. The villain does inexplicably horrible things - kill a guy for raising mild objections to his plan, experiment on cute lambs instead of mice (even though this would be prohibitively expensive) - and yet isn't played as a true sadist. A family conflict is exacerbated by senselessly not offering the perfectly reasonable explanation until late in the movie (an explanation refuted in a coda). The choice of a hero is weirdly arbitrary (considering the film's requirements, a gymnast would have been a better choice).<br/><br/>It's not as bad as 2002's Spider-man - the story and characters roughly make sense, at least - but everything is lazy and by-the-book.<br/><br/>The movie also has some rather unfortunate ""comedy relief"" in the form of a trio of borderline inept criminals. The weakness of the humor is surprising in a movie directed not by a director who has previously specialized in comedy; with the director and star, it's surprising how mildly comic this film is, although it does have its humorous moments, mainly involving the ants.<br/><br/>The special effects are decent. Not great, but perfectly serviceable.<br/><br/>The action is pretty good. Once again, not great, but there are some solid scenes and a nicely paced ending.<br/><br/>Neither the best nor the worst of the Marvel superhero films, Ant-Man is perfectly watchable. And that's about it."
"classicsoncall","9","2","5","25 January 2016"," ""I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.""
","For a second, maybe even a third tier Marvel Comic character, ""Ant-Man"" turned out to be a fun movie with a nice blend of action, suspense and humor. I got a kick out of the scientific jargon Dr. Henry Pym (Michael Douglas) used to describe his shrinking technology, a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. In a tribute to the comic book origin of Ant-Man, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) describes the shrinking process as a 'tale to astonish', a reference to 'Tales to Astonish #27' from January, 1962 in which the character made his first appearance. And as usual, Marvel writer, creator and editor Stan Lee cameos near the very end of the movie as a bartender, describing what might have been one's reaction to the picture - ""Yeah, crazy-stupid fine""! is the way he states it. I can go with that.<br/><br/>There's also the cool way the writers tied in the rest of the Marvel universe by referencing The Avengers (see my summary quote), and that scene with Ant-Man battling the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) on top of Avengers headquarters. All of this is played with just the right sort of tongue in cheek humor while miniaturizing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) in the Ant-Man suit and having him sabotage Cross's plan to sell his updated technology to the goons from Hydra. The only time I thought the film makers took it too far was having Ant-Man go sub-atomic and make it back again after Hank Pym's dire warning. That concept probably could have been saved for a sequel, although that idea was telegraphed pretty well.<br/><br/>Quite coincidentally as I watched this movie for the second time, I happened to be reading a novel by Michael Crichton entitled 'Micro' which borrows liberally from the Ant-Man concept. It tells the story of an evil scientific genius who shrinks some prospective new employees after they learn he might have had one of his vice presidents killed, brother to one of the students. The story deals with half inch humans in a novel way, placing their adventure in Hawaii and examining how they deal with threats from nature at ground level. It's a quick read and makes you think about life from a different perspective.<br/><br/>Anyway, like a lot of viewers, I think my surprise at how good this film turned out to be makes me look forward to what comes next. A couple of after film scenes hinted at not one, but two potential sequels. When Dr. Pym shows his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) the prototype suit he was working on with his deceased wife, it's suggested that the follow up movie further explores the sub-atomic world with an Ant-Woman. Then, an eventual Ant-Man team-up with the Avengers is suggested by the Falcon's cryptic words to Cap when he says ""I know a guy""."

","I went into Ant-Man knowing the history and already hating it. In case you didn't know Edgar Wright (director of Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) had a dream to make an Ant-Man movie, and he spent 8 years writing a script. He eventually gained the rights to make the movie and 2 weeks before production started he was kicked out of the director's chair and replaced by Peyton Reed. So I refused to spend any sort of currency on this movie because it would basically be telling Marvel that it's okay to crush one of the world's best director's lifelong dreams. Or anyone's dreams for that matter. Also, it's also a Marvel movie and they have a very bad reputation in my books. Despite all this prejudice, I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>The plot of Ant-Man was interesting. It was big scale while still remaining small enough to feel personal. In was right in the middle stages of becoming a world-threatening piece of unoriginal poop, and I liked that. There was a genuine threat to the world while still being personal, which I found that I liked quite a bit. <br/><br/>The characters were better than I expected. Like I said, this movie still manages to be personal, and the characters are a lot better developed than I expected. They manage to be funny without coming off as obnoxious or unrealistic, which is a plus too. <br/><br/>The fights were actually a lot of fun to watch. Having been told that the fights were more for comedic relief I was worried, considering I like serious superhero movies. However they helped to lighten the mood, especially towards the end. It never felt too serious, yet you knew that it was. Plus I just loved seeing two tiny people fight from close-up and then swap to seeing how it looks in a normal sized human's perspective. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie did give in to a handful of clichés, which was a downside. Although it wasn't a huge deal considering everything else was well done and these clichés actually had reasons for happening which made them more bearable. Despite this, I still found myself sighing with disappointment a few times. <br/><br/>Overall Ant-Man was a success in my eyes. While I still think Edgar Wright would have done a better job, I am happy to say that this is one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen. Next to the X-Men series (save for Days of Future Past), this is the best one I've seen. With a good plot, solid characters, and entertaining fights, this movie is a winner. In the end I would definitely recommend Ant- Man to Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans like myself."

","Having just given Star Wars: Force Awakens a generous 4 stars, not having any interest in comic book/super-heroes, and having hated just about anything out of Hollywood for as long as I can remember, it would be an understatement to say I wasn't expecting much from this. But it came recommended from a credible couple, and when presented by chance as a cheap rental deal on Google Film yesterday I thought what the hell - its Christmas, why not watch a film. <br/><br/>Impressive. Thoroughly enjoyable. Humour was great, CGI outstanding, even moving in places. Plot holes and cringe-worthy sections (the last third got weaker) are all part of the score for comic book fantasy and in keeping with the genre style. But are shrunk away, like out hero going sub-atomic, by the film's better points. I wish the same could have been said for the recent Star Wars. <br/><br/>The film has a few flaws, not anything to make even someone as disinterested as I am think poorly of the production though. It would take something pretty epic and thought provoking to warrant a 9 or 10 stars in my book, and I'm surprised myself to be giving it a 7 (7.5?). But great fun to watch, even for those of you who think you couldn't possibly be interested."
"Merlin-Knight","8","2","5","24 December 2015"," My 2 Cents
","First off I have to say I am rather critical about most superhero movies I know a great many of the original story lines and all to often I find that a lot of writers take a little to much artistic licensing with somethings and as a result they change the back story or even the original story line to much. Sadly I do feel they did that with this movie as well however I am happy to say that for the most part I think the spirit behind the original story line was kept. <br/><br/>That being said I have to say that I thought the acting was well done the characters seemed to have real chemistry between them.. The Special effects though were seen through most of the movie were not so over powering that they would take away from the acting or the story line itself. As a stand alone movie if I had never heard of Ant-Man before I would say it would be a 9 but because I have knowledge of the original story line of the hero I have to say 8. <br/><br/>All in all a very good movie I totally recommend seeing it."

","I love Marvel and just about everything Marvel puts out. In fact, because this was a Marvel character I watched it. I say that because Ant-Man was never that intriguing to me in the comics and it didn't sound anymore intriguing just because it was on film. But alas, Marvel usually does a good production so what's a couple of dollars and two hours on a weeknight? <br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" was able to make an otherwise ridiculous sounding superhero kinda cool. There was a little bit of back story offered to help the audience understand who created Ant-Man and what the potential conflict would be. Of course it always helps if you're a fan of the comic because then you're totally plugged in to the entire story.<br/><br/>This wasn't one of Marvel's best in my opinion but I can see how and why they are expounding upon the movies they release. 1.) It offers more flavors for the general public and 2.) It sets up for a very awesome super movie which can potentially integrate all of these characters into the story (ala Civil War, House of M, or Secret Invasion for all of you Marvel comic nerds like me)."

Ant-Man is a bit different of a movie then the other Marvel films, and it is a great move on their part. The fact that they are building up the franchise is exciting. With all the new characters being added, the future of Marvel is in no worry. Paul Rudd is exceptional as Scott Lang, bringing most of the humor to the film. The fight scenes are hilarious, due to the size of the characters and surroundings, and also intense. The cameo by a certain Avenger is also a nice tip of the hat to the fans.

Paul Rudd really played a good portrayal of Scott Lang! He was the hero we all wanted. Evangeline Lilly was Hope, and she was a very good choice for the role. Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket was a good choice also. He was the evil guy that nobody liked. I was very into him as the villain, much better than the likes of Ronan and Abomination. But the real deal is Michael Douglas! This guy was absolutely incredible as Hank Pym. The action and effects were off the charts, definitely deserving an Oscar nomination. I could ramble on and on about how great this was, but it did have its flaws. Paul Rudd is a funny guy. But he didn't really get to show his humor in this.

Elements like Yellow Jacket loosing his mind(which was actually Hank Pym) A Great, fun movie. I know that people complained about Michael Peña's character stereotyped portrayal of Luis but he's always portrayed characters similar to this character. At a certain point it's not type casting, it's an actor choosing to portray such characters. He's a grown man, same as Tip 'T.I.' Harris. It's on them what kind of characters they portray. Actors need to take some responsibility for the characters they choose to play. Regardless, everyone was great in this film.<br/><br/>I still can't believe Marvel/Disney snagged a great actor like Michael Douglas.<br/><br/>Marvel is still doing a great job trying to tie in this huge series. This is an experiment that has been rocky at times but remains refreshing. Delivering a great product for the whole family."

","Caught Marvels Studios newer ""Ant-Man"" today off Redbox, and was happy with the experience. Although it starts off a bit slowly and drops into cliché on occasion, it picks up well. Director Peyton Reed has cut a good balance of adventure, action, and comedy. Paul Rudd looks to have physically prepared for his big part and pulls it off OK though a maybe a bit blandly. The SFX were very good, and I liked all the ant varieties on display. One can't help but compare to :Honey I Shrunk the Kids"", which was marvelous and trailblazing in its own right, this was more frenetic and energetic. And it was a good watch. (Spoilers) The bug-zapper was priceless. Recommended 7/10."

","""My days of breaking into places and stealing sh*t are done. What do you want me to do? I want you to break into a place and steal some sh*t.""<br/><br/>Is it a plane? Is it a bird? Is it Superman? No, it's just an ordinary guy named Scott Lang (Rudd Paul) who stole from some millionaires in a digital, Robin Hood-like way in the past and who can transform into a superhero the size of an ant by using a high-tech suit. This suit was designed by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and reduces the distance between atoms. Thus, it's not a spider bite or the exposure to certain radiations that created Ant-man. Is it so super hero-like, say, like Spiderman? Yes and no. I don't think there's need for a sequel. The overall content is a bit too ... euh ... I could say a bit to ""little"" for that. But the tongue in cheek humor then again was enjoyable. Pretty much a sort of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" humor. This was already evident from the beginning with this hilarious excerpt: ""Hey, how's your girl man? Oh, she left me. Oh. Yeah, my mom died too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van! ""<br/><br/>Marvel keeps coming up with new action heroes. That's no surprise since they have quite a collection after all these years. Besides the well-known superheroes like ""Spiderman"", ""X-Men"", ""Hulk"", ""Daredevil"", ""Blade"", ""The Avengers"" and ""Iron Man"", they recently introduced several new ones such as ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""The Fantastic Four"". And next year, they'll add some more : ""Deadpool""(I'm waiting impatiently for this one), ""Gambit"" and ""Black Panther"". And now they introduce Ant-Man at the last moment. Although I'm about to succumb to a Marvel-saturation, I'm always keen to see a new super hero at work. The advantage of Ant-Man is that you don't need to be a real Marvel freak to follow the story. And despite being one of the least-known Marvel characters (plus the critics were quite harsh), the film itself managed to be successful. <br/><br/>Ant-Man's objective isn't as grandiose as in most Marvel films. In other words there's no need to protect earth against total annihilation or subjugation. Hank Pym uses a devious way to put Scott Lang in a dilemma so that Scott is forced to help him with the recovery of his invention. And this because of the fact that it could be used for less peaceful purposes. Not very original as you might think at first sight and yet they knew how to make it an entertaining and action-packed adaptation of a action hero comic book. Especially with the emphasis on the comical aspect. A Marvel movie you shouldn't take too seriously. Actually, it's a kind of ""Honey, I shrunk the kids"", the adult version.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the storyline is pretty clichéd. Another poor devil who gets no chance in society due to a mistake and is destined to return to his criminal activities. There's also a rising employee who filches the life's work of his employer. And then of course there's the inevitable confrontation between the end products of the two rivals. But ""Ant-Man"" is still an excellent film. Especially by the use of the interwoven humor (Michael Pena ensures some hilarious moments) and the superb special effects. The learning process Scott goes through to familiarize himself with the designed suit, is hilarious and splendidly visualized. The acting of Paul Rudd (who'll always stick in my memory as Mike of the brilliant sitcom ""Friends"") was acceptable. Although he doesn't look like real superhero material with his puppy appearance, he succeeded in showing an ideal mix of amazement and determination. Even Michael Douglas' performance was plausible.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is an action-packed, light-hearted superhero movie. Especially the end is breathtaking and filled with scenes that'll last a lifetime. Also the various references to other Marvel heroes was original, culminating in a confrontation between Ant-Man and one of the Avengers. Who thinks the hilarious talking tree from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" would be unbeatable, will have to revise his opinion after witnessing this tiny little figure that travels on the back of an ant.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
"largarra","7","2","5","14 December 2015"," Ant-Man (2015): Movie Review
","When I first heard the news that Marvel was producing a film about ""Ant-Man,"" I thought that there was no way it could be good. How could a movie about a superhero who can control ants be interesting at all? Furthermore, my doubts on how well the movie would do were further diminished when I found out that Paul Rudd, a comedian, was going to play the lead role of Scott Lang who would eventually become ""Ant- Man."" I never thought Rudd was a poor actor, just not one who could pull off a comic book hero role. I entered the theater without high expectations, but left pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" turned out to be a fun, different, and off-beat film. It tells the story of a master thief named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who has just gotten out of prison and is trying to make amends and keep a job. Lang is divorced but has a young daughter who idolizes him. Lang eventually comes in contact with a mysterious man named Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) whose plans for Lang end up changing his life. This film develops each one of the main characters fairly well. It shows us that although Scott Lang has a criminal background, he still generally means well. It also builds on Douglas's character as well as on Evangeline Lilly's character, Hope Van Dyne, although in this review I don't want to give away too much.<br/><br/>There are also many little things that make this movie charming. Paul Rudd ends up playing Scott Lang wonderfully. He delivers his lines well and plays the character exactly the way he should. Douglas is great as he normally is, and Lilly portrays her serious character quite well. Corey Stoll's ""Darren Cross"" is a generally interesting villain, although there wasn't much that made him stand out from other villains in the Marvel universe. The comic relief character, Michael Peña, is spot on. His character is a silly, small-time thief who is a friend of Lang's and who accompanied him on his past crimes. Overall, the casting choices proved to be effective.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Ant-Man"" is a film that I believe anybody can enjoy, superhero fan or not. The characters are likable, the story is different enough from a standard Marvel film to make it interesting, and there's plenty of humor, character development, and action to make this movie worth seeing again. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Paul Rudd's ""Ant-Man"" in movies to come. I rate this movie a solid 8/10, and strongly recommend it."
"Reno-Rangan","8","2","5","14 December 2015"," Size doesn't matter if he's a superhero who committed to save the world.
","My confession is I never read 'Ant-man' comics and I never knew such kind of superhero even exist in Marvel till this movie was announced. (But I know Danish film 'Antboy'.) So I'm glad they brought cinematic version of 'Ant-man' and I'm sure he'll return to the next 'Avengers' as they promoted strongly in this film itself to know what would be the audience response. I don't know others, but I definitely welcome the idea.<br/><br/>Another CGI magic, another Marvel's wonder. As long as they pick the right cast and crew with a good story, the sci-fi like this continues to rule the cinema world. It was a great team work, that must be appreciated. As usual the top notch visuals as well the performances, even the sidekicks. But I was surprised to see when Paul Rudd was attached to this project. I believed it would be a comedy sci-fi packed with full of action, and I was wrong. It was a simple tale, a heist theme and of course it was fun to watch, but never was a comedy movie.<br/><br/>A wonderful beginning, especially for the first film in the series. You know strong foundation is the key to raise a building above. I know the sequels would only get better by progressing and it should be. Because in all the Marvel's superhero flicks, this one was the most family and young kids friendly. That does not mean there were no violence, but from the title to the characters and presentation, all were so casual and can be understood by all.<br/><br/>It was so great to see a legend like Michael Douglas to be a part in the modern movie. Now I am eager to see Evangeline Lily as Wasp-girl in the follow-up. It would be like Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, but in a sci-fi version. The extras were very interesting, I enjoyed them as well. If you're are yet to see the film, don't expect anything like Disney's 'Honey' trilogy, after all, if you enjoy the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) then you would do same for it which is the twelfth to follow.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Given the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be. Unsurprisingly with a Marvel Super Hero film, the critical reactions have been mixed, but given it's not as gargantuan as most Marvel pics it proves to have a big entertaining heart. A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.<br/><br/>The effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity. Sure, some of it's just plain daft, our hero's powers are hardly blunderbuss stuff, while the family melodramas bubbling away feel tired, but come the glorious finale, pandering to the child in us all, it's another Marvel winner readying itself for further adventures of Ant-Man. 7.5/10"
"JackGunnerstone","8","4","15","5 August 2015"," Small but Powerful
","Ant-Man is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd, Michael Douglass, Corey Stoll, and Evangeline Lily. The film starts off with cat burglar Scott Lang, played by Paul Rudd, finally finishing his time in prison and being picked up in a van by former cell-mate Luis, who offers Scott to stay at his apartment along with two other people. One day, Luis tips off Scott telling him about a grand robbery that they can do together, and after some time Scott agrees. However, when Scott gets into the vault in the basement all he finds is a weird looking suit, and now we have Ant-Man. <br/><br/>So I liked Ant-Man for several reasons. First, the acting was on point. Michael Douglass was outstanding as the father in a difficult relationship with his daughter character, and as Scott's mentor. At times, it does feel like Douglass's character wishes Scott were his son, and that he devotes more time into Scott than his own daughter. And Paul Rudd, whom I only know from The Perks of Being a Wallflower, was really good in this movie, and I'm pretty sure this is his one of his best performances in any film. He really embodies his character, a criminal with good intentions. Everything he does in this film has to do with the love he has for his daughter, and how much he wants to be with her. This is one of the main points that sets Ant-Man apart from most other Superhero movies. The idea that even a criminal father can save the world is quite original on its part. <br/><br/>Another great aspect of this film was the concept, a superhero who could instantly shrink to the size of an insect. The movie really does a great job with this concept, letting Ant-man play to his strength of overpowering his enemies with insane agility and strength packed into an inch tall figure. One of my favorite shots in this film is where you could see Ant-man running up the slide of a firing pistol and overpowering his assailant. <br/><br/>I especially liked the perspective this film gives us on ants and insects in general. The shots following Ant-man around running and jumping and avoiding the towering humans feet are not only really awesome, but show how difficult it is to live as an insect. The only other film that I can think of that employs this concept is the 2007 animated film Ratatouille, which if you haven't seen, watch it IMMEDIATELY. <br/><br/>Now there is a lot of humor in this film, and at times it does get in the way of the action and the story, at least in my opinion. However, Paul Rudd really nails his part of being a hilarious and likable protagonist. <br/><br/>Overall, Ant-Man had great action sequences, a great concept, great performances, and an astonishingly strong superhero. I'm gonna give Ant- Man a 9 out of 10. Ant-Man is one of those movies that you can just go to and have a blast with. This is a great summer popcorn superhero movie, and I highly recommend seeing it. So what do you think about Ant- Man? Make sure you let me know in the comment section below, and thanks for reading!"

"kieranbattams","10","4","15","17 July 2015"," Smaller scale but heroes.. and films, don't get any bigger!
","I have been following Ant Man since Edgar Wright was set to direct as i am a massive fan of his work. Then he left the project. I was worried Ant Man would just get lost in two different screenplays as i heard Wright's work was still being incorporated in, plus not knowing enough about the character from the comics.. But there really was no need to worry. The film turned out better than i could have hoped and even trumped my expectations. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd does a great job and brings his all to the role of Scott Lang, a thief who has just come out of jail after three years. Over at Pym Tech Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is developing a formula to mirror Hank Pym's (the original Ant Man) and to create a new breed of soldiers called the 'Yellowjacket'. Pym recruits Scott Lang as the new Ant Man to pull off a heist which will save the lives of millions.. and that is pretty much our movie. Michael Douglas plays Pym in this film and he really does it so well. Every time he was on screen he was a blast to watch and listen to and the father/daughter dynamic and storyline between him and Hope (Evangeline Lilly) without giving spoilers, was great to see. When Pym is training Scott to become the new Ant Man, that was so fun to watch and you can tell Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas had a great time working with each other. I was sort of worried at first that the shrinking and growing repeatedly during fight scenes would get on my nerves as at first it takes a while to adjust to (especially in 3d), but i actually liked that a lot and loved seeing the scenes where Scott was training with the ants when he is small.<br/><br/>Speaking of the ants, they were brilliant. The way they are introduced by Pym seemed ridiculous to me at first but i loved watching them. Seeing Scott interact with them and fly around on them, it was so cool and something we haven't previously seen in any film. Marvel aren't very strong on villains and we have known this as it has been shown countless times. Villains like Abomination, Whiplash and Ronan have always felt weak and just as if they were made to serve as a plot device. I loved Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket though. I mean, he is sort of introduced as a villain to start with for not much of a reason but unlike most MCU villains he was expanded upon. When he actually put on the Yellowjacket suit, that was great and something that felt fresh, to see him as well as Ant Man duking it out whilst growing and shrinking and throwing objects that are three times their size. The climax featuring none other than Thomas the Tank Engine was one of my favourite fight scenes in the entire Marvel series. In fact, there is another fight featuring a well known Avenger that you probably know of, but just in case you don't i wont reveal what it is, but i loved that one as well.<br/><br/>Michael Pena also gives a standout performance. These films feature a comic relief character a lot of the time, but if it works then don't fix it. Every time he was on screen i was laughing and i thought he did a very good job. Anyway,to wrap it up, i enjoyed Ant Man so much. I loved the scenes with Scott kicking a$$ as Ant Man, i loved Michael Douglas, Yellowjacket was awesome.. i don't really think i saw any flaws with this one. If Marvel continue to give their lesser known characters such good films then i am definitely on board the same way i was with Guardians of the Galaxy. Plus their are two post credits scenes which i loved. Really gets me excited to see not only Ant Man's future, but the future of the whole MCU. Another great film and i haven't given this rating since Age of Ultron, not because i'm a fanboy.... but because i know good entertainment and if a film entertains me as much as Ant Man does, it deserves this high of a rating.🐜"

","As the Marvel franchise has grown to epic proportions with it's unique and compelling take on superhero movies, some of the lesser known characters are starting to emerge and gain popularity, with Ant-Man possibly being the most unique of them all. I don't know how the story in the comic was, but I can tell you this, Ant-Man is the perfect character for the big screen. The special effects are nothing short of magic and take the concepts of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids to a whole other level. Scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) created a new technology, one that was so dangerous, he buried the research deep in his company archives, but when his successor comes across it years later, he develops it, despite warning from Pym. In order to stop this from getting out, Pym recruits an unlikely hero to help him, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Lang is one of the best burglars around and Pym hopes to use these unique skills to get back his work. The only thing is the company's lab is impenetrable to all, except bugs. Using his prototype, Lang becomes Ant-Man and that is when this film really gets fun. Paul Rudd is absolutely terrific in this movie, as a small, nerdy, awkward guy, he can be hysterical under the right circumstances and this was just the perfect role for his personality. Rudd is paired with Michael Douglas, who 10 years ago wouldn't have even considered doing a film like this, showing just how powerful and influential the Marvel brand has become. Out of all the Marvel films to date this is perhaps the most interesting one. The cast is amazing, the special effects are outstanding, and I may never see Thomas The Train in the same way again. If you're like me, and not crazy about superheroes, don't let that stop you from seeing this film. Ant-Man has a little bit of everything and goes way beyond anything I would have ever expected to see in film based on a comic book."
"hegliehj","7","3","10","10 August 2015"," Absolutely Brilliant
","I must admit when I first heard they're making a movie about an ant man, I thought to myself that it was going to be such a waste of time, but as a movie addict, I've learnt to never judge a movie by its name, so when they've started broadcasting the trailer of the movie, that thought disappeared and was replaced by a must watch. Of course the trailer brings a major effect on how an individual views the contents of the film, but don't let them fool you. <br/><br/>I personally haven't seen a lot of movies for the actor Paul Rudd, but I must say I was pretty impressed by the acting techniques, ability to cope to with each situation he was put to during the movie. I can't say that the same applies to Michael Douglas as he is just THAT fantastic, no word's said, definitely. The whole concept of the the ant man was marvel-ous, and how this basic simple idea can change our world. The power to shift in sizes, imagine what can you do with such power. The concept was well delivered, but the story itself makes no sense, bad story line, but good sequence of events. I've excepted this to be some kind of serious action movie where I hear nothing but a smashing sound here and there, but unlike other marvel movies, this was by far the most the funniest, which is something I pretty disliked about the movie. I'm not saying that they shouldn't have written a better dialogue, and I completely understand they've chosen a specific dialogue of the story to fit the character of the ant man. The casting crew was well chosen, the visual effects and the filming were also well managed and well-done. One thing that completely dazzled me, and had me in an off-shock bizarre state is the 3 or 5 minutes of the movie where he -the ant man dives into a part of the unseen reality of objects around us, there, on that very specific last destination where he lies hopelessly in the darkness within. SO BREATHTAKING. The overall review of the movie is that it's absolutely brilliant."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","3","10","23 July 2015"," This Small Package Packs a Lot of Punch
","The least godly of all the Marvel heroes, Ant-Man is just a mildly intelligent, crafty guy, down on his luck but pure of heart, who catches the eye of a reclusive genius and becomes heir to his technological throne. It's not intergalactic like Guardians, it boasts no billionaire playboys like Iron Man, no political intrigue or mythological hijinx like Cap or Thor, and while all of those absences do make it feel like less of a heavyweight, they also give it a unique sense of relatable identity. This is the little guy (womp womp), one of the unwashed throngs, who dares to climb Olympus and greet the immortals. I can get behind that. It's also a great showcase of the merry Marvel mojo, casually blending well-timed wisecracks with steep ideas, loud action sets and a heavy dose of worldbuilding. That constant sense of a shared landscape, long a cornerstone of the comic book's universe, has begun to bear ripened fruit recently, and Ant-Man profits from the mere association. Truly, it's his interactions with the characters we already know, no matter how secondary they may be, that makes this seem like more than just another origin story. Paul Rudd does a nice job of pulling off the leading role, not too wacky nor too straight-laced, and his essential chemistry with Michael Douglas (the aforementioned genius) carries the picture a nice, long distance. Great effects work gets us the rest of the way, with a whole armload of inventive, fascinating, smirk-inducingly cool expositionary scenes leading the charge. Think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with more balls and a much bigger budget. It's not the best of the Marvel lot, but it's among them, and I can't wait to see where the character goes from here.<br/><br/>Updated thoughts after a recent re-watch (2018):<br/><br/>Inventive and entertaining, if inessential in retrospect, as we now know Ant-Man has very little influence on the rest of the Marvel universe. Paul Rudd is an excellent choice as leading character Scott Lang, plucky but enduring, a perennial sad sack whose intentions are pure, even if his means are not. He always seems to come out holding the short straw, but his real strength is in turning those negatives around.<br/><br/>That endurance is the essence of his character, and comes into play repeatedly during his evolution into a size-adaptive micro-hero. His arc is well-worn and simple, nothing we haven't seen before really, but Rudd's ability to remain off-the-cuff and endearing (plus a few creative screenwriting ideas) keep the general act from feeling too stale.<br/><br/>The real sizzle is in the action, anyway, wherein we see common everyday objects from awe-inspiring new perspectives. The effects team does their job well here. In a flash, a bathtub becomes a vast expanse. A crowded dance floor transforms into a deadly obstacle course. Witty and engaging as the script may be, the film truly lives or dies based on the success of those scenes, and without exception, they come up big. It's a good time, particularly when playing with the theoretical physics of the character's many transformations, but just a touch on the lighter side."

"rgkarim","8","3","10","18 July 2015"," A Marching Start for The Next Wave
","Marvel has entered its third wave and the intended schedule shows a lot of ""origin"" stories in the works. When it comes to these starter films, Marvel has been hit or miss, in my opininon, and sometimes can leave you a bit disappointed. This weekend we got Ant- Man in the works, a tale I didn't have much hope for in terms of quality Marvel movies. However, could there be surprises in store that will make this enjoyable, you never know. Hi I'm Robbie K and this is another Robbie Review. <br/><br/>When you hear the name Ant-Man you might just laugh at the lame title he holds. I mean how can someone like that be a real threat? Well don't count him out yet, as those of the lore know that big things do indeed come in small packages. Ant-Man surprisingly has quite an array of powers, the classic one being shrinking to the size of an ant to infiltrate whatever fortress he is assigned. Yet by reaching this size he obtains heightened speed, strength, and agility that when combined with a training montage led by Evangeline Lilly leads to a top notch weapon. The pint sized hero also gains the technology to communicate with ants, and use their versatile nature in his assignments, which again might sound like a wimpy power but holds incredible potential. This leads me to my favorite part of this movie: the action. <br/><br/>Director Peyton Reed has coordinated his team to make an exciting film that has plenty of fast paced, punch throwing moments that will have you wheeling in delight. Ant- man's action starts with a comedic training sequence to warm you up, but then cascades into some big stunts filled with numerous shots of Paul Rudd disappearing and reappearing in front of his opponent. Sure this gets stale, but fortunately they mix things up as the camera dives into artificial scenes of war, which are often simple areas like carpeted floors and grass but from an ant's perspective. And speaking of ants, the team brought a great dynamic with the ants, establish a foot soldier motif with them and having them coordinate strikes. I felt like I was back in Star Wars again as flying ants led ground troops into the heart of danger, often with accompanying laser sounds to add more galactic atmosphere to it. All of the graphics involved with this are impressive, solid movement, good definition, and some bright special effects as well. Overall the action is decent. <br/><br/>The big factor that most are going to enjoy I feel is the comedy. Ant-Man does a great job of relieving the stress with multiple comedic moments that range from situational slapstick to well timed quips. Paul Rudd leads the comedy with his acting, managing to bring his typical self into the part and leave you chuckling. The writing is clever and delivered with just the right intensity to sell the line and maximize the laughs. Michael Douglas also brings a set of laughs to the mix and his blunt mannerisms are welcomed as he zings the characters with witty dialogue. Michael Pena helps with the simpler comedy, using his talents to please the audience members who love the more ridiculous and exaggerated moments. His voice was probably the funniest aspect of his moments and the director limiting the number of jokes with him was also a smart move. Outside of the actors, Ant-Man has some other fun trinkets, including turning a toy train set into a ""death"" arena, anthropomorphic qualities in ants, and a few comic surprises that cap everything. This film is certainly one of Marvel's most humorous projects, and did a nice job balancing the laughs with the action. <br/><br/>But alas there were a few things that fell off the scale and could have used some tweaking. At the beginning the plot is very rushed, with little hindrance and in depth character development. His initiation is practically dull, his training almost devoid of any real struggle, and even the magnitude of the crime he committed was blown over. Another weakness was Hank and Hope's tale, the tension and drama are there, but the details remain hidden and suddenly are dropped in at once. Then the second half of the movie happens and that is when the entertaining and intriguing moments happen. There is also a lot of predictability in this tale as well, lacking any real twist or surprise, but that is only a minor thing. This is when connections to the other movies happen and the plot development and tension occur. Outside of the plot, the action does get a little repetitive with the whole shrinking and expanding moment, and I could have been happier with more ant moments. <br/><br/>I got to say that Ant-Man is a well done intro film that has a little something for everyone. The action is fitting, the comedy clever and balanced, and the movie overall fun and entertaining. The story needs some tweaking, and it definitely has some other areas that weren't the jaw dropping experience we've had in the past. Yet I feel it is a good and fun blockbuster for the summer. I encourage many to go have fun with this movie, but avoid the 3-D aspect because I don't see it adding much to the film for the extra cost. <br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Action/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"
"rcuttill","9","4","16","5 August 2015"," An enjoyable romp
","An enjoyable romp. Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang / Ant-Man as the bit of a loser but with potential. Michael Douglas plays Dr. Hank Pym as the clever guy who needs Scott Lang's help. He's to stop Darren Cross / Yellowjacket (Corey Storr) as the marvellously cold villain. Hope van Dyne, (Evangeline Lilly) Hank's daughter, is helping them. Scott is supported by his former cellmate Luis (Michael Peña). Scott and Luis provide quite a bit of the humour (humor if you prefer). Dr Hank Pym, Hope and Darren Cross help give it more gravitas. Both the drama and the humour are flawlessly interwoven. Neither seems strained. The action sequences and special effects are good and the concept of being able to shrink things and enlarge them later is given a full airing and clearly the central focus that it needs. All in all an enjoyable romp and if you watch this wait for the extras in and after the credits."
"Njkinny","9","3","11","12 August 2015"," Ant-Man : Big Entertainment in small packing ~ Loved this movie!
","I have to confess, I just love Superhero movies and have diligently followed all the movies till date. But when I heard about Ant-Man, I was a bit skeptical. I mean a small, ant sized hero didn't quite give me the confidence that Captain America with his eight pack abs gives me. How would such a tiny hero fight his enemies who surely wouldn't be ant sized?<br/><br/>Not having read the comics, I wasn't really interested in watching this movie in a theater but I am so happy that I did. Ant-Man took me by surprise with the amount of entertainment it provided me. There is an engaging plot, noteworthy acting, good comic timing which had the viewers laughing and then some amazing stunts with an ample dose of knowledge about the ants provided.<br/><br/>The underdog hero whose lucrative career with a respectable standing in life goes in the dump, the day he robs his own company which is engaged in shady business, is expertly played by Paul Rudd. He is funny, seemingly good-for-nothing but a very slippery and capable cat burglar, a caring father who is determined to turn his life around for his daughter and then suddenly the superhero we love so much!<br/><br/>Michael Douglas with his smooth and captivating voice plays the role of Dr. Hank Pym well while Evangeline Lilly plays the role of his estranged daughter to perfection. She is strong, independent, skilled and in every way as formidable as any superhero with her great ant skills, pro martial arts skills and a sharp brain.<br/><br/>Corey Stoll as the evil and very unhinged Darren managed to frighten and instill fear in me.<br/><br/>But the character that takes the cake, in my opinion, is Michael Pena as Luis, Scott (Paul Rudd)'s silly and comedian comrade in crimes and his cellmate in jail. His comedy had us laughing every now and then and his acting made me a fan of his. He is calculatedly funny, silly, then loyal and finally shifting seamlessly to daring. His facial expressions, voice modulation and overall dialogue delivery brought out the 'laugh-out-loud' laughs all through the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is different from the other Marvel movies in terms of the action. This one is not as action packed as the Avengers. It has a balance of comedy, story, emotional play, daring situations, shocking scientific inventions and then a final fight which despite the action was also comic and had the viewers laughing along with feeling scared and gasping.<br/><br/>The Ant-Man's transitions from tiny to normal are fluid and the graphics here noteworthy. Nothing seems artificial. It all looks real and very possible right from the ants to the tiny Ant-Man to the other realm. The 3D effects are few but well timed.<br/><br/>Overall, Ant-Man is a unique and entertaining Superhero flick that is total paisa vasool (worth every penny spent). Go watch it and enjoy! :)<br/><br/>I loved every second of the movie and can't wait for the next part to release. <br/><br/>PS: Stay till the end of the movie so you don't miss the secret ending! :)<br/><br/>This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff"
"mat-dragonfire","9","3","11","26 July 2015"," I believe I can fly... with Ant-Man
","The new Marvel's Ant-Man is a blow of fresh wind in this hot summer of mega block-busters. I went to see the movie without much expectation but what the movie did was incredible.<br/><br/>First of all, the story. It tells the classic, ordinary man-to-hero story, as do all the Marvel and DC movies. However, the way this movie, or rather its actors tell the story is what sets this movie apart from others. There is plenty of jokes, comedy and things that sound simply wrong (in that comical way) in this movie. The progress of the story is satisfactory and you can clearly differentiate the protagonist at the beginning from the protagonist at the end of the movie. Not just that, some of the supporting characters receive their five minutes of glory as well and they develop wonderfully.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, actors did their jobs brilliantly. Rudd delivers his performance as a con-man and a comedian quite well (albeit not as flawlessly as Pena) and his ""nemesis"" Stoll is perfect as the antagonist Yellowjacket. Lilly has done an awesome job as a supporting character and Douglas, well there's nothing to say about his performance that hasn't already been said. Oh and let's not forget the appearance of our tie-ins, the Falcon (Mackie) and our girl Carter (yay, Hayley Atwell!) who delivered their parts solidly as well.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is something you'll either love or hate (just like the rest of MCU) but might as well be something that'll entertain you for the duration of 117 min. I find the movie to be sticking out of the overly dark lot that the Avengers (and Ironman and Thor and... well just about every Marvel movie I've gotten used to these days) have become. Much like what Guardians of the Galaxy did when they entered the stage, this movie has repeated with its fresh tone, fresh cast and ""fresh"" (the concept is fresh, the premise not so much) story . You've definitely got my recommendation to watch it."
"ryandannar","8","3","11","25 July 2015"," Fun Like a 1950's Pop-Sci-Fi Fantasy
","Given the fact that I'm quite sick of superhero movies, I was surprised to find how thoroughly l enjoyed ""Ant-Man."" This is the most fun I've had at a superhero film since probably the first ""Avengers."" In fact, I may have liked it better than ""Avengers."" I might even call it my favorite of all of the Marvel films.<br/><br/>There are quite a few reasons I found Ant-Man so appealing. For starters, I liked the fact that it tells a small-scale story, centered mostly around a guy, a heist, and his training to perform the heist in a desperate effort to win back visitation rights to see his daughter.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that the stakes are relatively small, at least on Marvel's terms. At some point in the film's chain of logic, the fate of the world would indeed be at stake, but the biggest threat that presents itself in the film is a dude who just happens to have a suit very similar to Ant-Man's suit. Likewise, the most meaningful thing at stake isn't the safety of the world, but a father's relationship with his daughter.<br/><br/>This is a Marvel film that puts a lot of emphasis on the characters. That it does so without lacking in action, comedy, suspense, or the expected trappings of a Marvel film, is quite a nifty trick.<br/><br/>Another nifty trick is how the film turns its absurd premise -- ""A dude can shrink but maintain his normal strength, AND he can control ants!"" -- into a playground of fun, knowingly ridiculous moments and situations. The film doesn't try to excuse its own ridiculousness, or shy away from it. It just presents itself as ridiculous, and has a lot of fun doing things that way.<br/><br/>I really admired the effects-work in this film. While many Marvel films appear to be saturated with wall-to-wall CGI, the effects in Ant-Man have a tangible quality about them. I have no doubt that a great amount of CGI was used in this film, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they used practical effects wherever possible; the film has that kind of visual ""weight."" It looks like real things are really happening. I can't honestly say that about most of the Marvel films; even though Marvel often does a bang-up job with CGI, and even though the results are usually pleasing to look at, they often don't feel ""real."" That might be by design. These are, after all, comic-book films. But I much prefer the visual effects in Ant-Man to any of its Marvel predecessors.<br/><br/>The effects involving Ant-Man's interaction with ants -- especially when he's shrunken to their size -- are especially great! All odds would point to these scenes being extremely unconvincing. However, director Peyton Reed, however improbably, makes these sequences SING. Watching one of these scenes, with Ant-Man infiltrating an anthill and trying to make psychic contact with its denizens, I put the plot and the context of the scene out of my mind for a moment, and just watched action on screen, in purely compositional terms. It was a fantastic blend of 1950's pulp-SciFi book-jacket art, and Salvador Dali-esque surrealist spectacle. It's hard not to wonder what the film's original director, Edgar Wright, might have done with material like this. Wright, who is known for his impeccable visual stylings and clockwork-tight filmmaking, might have made something even better out of such stuff! But Reed, or his filmmaking team, definitely had a strong vision for these scenes. What could have easily been the film's weakest element, in their hands, becomes one of its greatest strengths.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the sheer fun the film has exploring common household topography from an ant's perspective. The ""shrinking man"" film trope dates back to the 1950's, I think, and there's always a bit of kitch involved whenever Hollywood decides to recycle it. How long has it been since there was a successful movie about ""shrinking"" people? Was it as far back as ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids?"" At any rate, the ""shrinkdown"" effect is particularly well-imagined here, giving us a sense of how Ant- Man finds himself suddenly swallowed-up by empty space every time he shrinks, how in the matter of an instant, the bottom of a bathtub impossibly expands to become a vast, desolate flatland.<br/><br/>There's a sequence later in the film when Ant-Man must ""go subatomic,"" which is a no-no akin to ""crossing the streams"" in ""Ghostbusters."" The visuals accompanying his subatomic trek are the purest kind of cinematic joy. Imagine the ""zooming through the Monolith"" sequence in 2001, updated for today's audiences, and done really well. My only complaint was that this sequence was too short. I could have gone on watching it for several minutes!<br/><br/>I caught the film in its ""RealD"" Digital-3D presentation. I don't usually prefer 3D; usually I avoid it. But here, I was surprised by how effectively the film uses the third dimension to express the scale of Ant-Man's surroundings. Visually, this movie is all about ""scale."" When the film is in action-mode (which is much of the time), its every shot is designed as a way of contrasting the size of one thing with the size of another. The film's use of 3D in assisting with that effect is fantastic. I don't usually recommend a film's 3D presentation, but if you don't mind wearing those silly glasses, Ant-Man uses 3D very, very well.<br/><br/>It should go without saying that Marvel films always contain ""extra scenes"" during and after the credits. This one contains two such scenes, and you'll definitely want to stick around for them."
"amitashb803","8","3","11","24 July 2015"," Smallest superhero with super-size fun
","Initially I thought Ant-Man will be Marvel's stupidest film, but I'm proved wrong. After disappointing Age of Ultron, Ant-Man brings a refreshing concept by incorporating a heist film with superhero film. Movie starts with younger Hank Pym having a fallout with Stark Industries as he feared his tech will be misused. Few years later, we meet our hero Scott Lang, an ex-con & burglar who is just out of prison, having a hard time getting a job & failing to provide child support. Salvation comes in form of Dr. Pym who offers him a shot at redemption by asking him to steal Yellowjacket suit from Darren Cross's (Pym's protégé, who invents his own version of Ant-Man suit & Pym particles & plan to sell them to highest bidder) highly secured facility. So Pym & his daughter Hope train Scott to use Ant-Man suit & also to control army of ants! There are plenty of tongue-in-cheek moments with delivery of funny lines throughout. All actors provide strong performances, but the main surprise is Michael Pena's Luis who almost steals the show with his wildly cheerful, hilarious comic performance. Action scenes are zippy & colorful with CGI heavy climax. There's no usual destruction of cities, collapsing skyscrapers or falling landmasses from sky. Wasp does make a small appearance & also an Avenger who picks a fight with Ant-Man. Overall the film is pretty good though it once again brings out marvel's problem in fabricating a very good villain. But in the end, smallest superhero provides the super-size fun."
"burlesonjesse5","6","3","11","20 July 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Ant-Man
","""Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man."" So quips the Michael Douglas character, a radical physicist with a penchant for training ant organisms of the malevolent kind. Me, well I had a ""need"" to see Ant-Man the movie, a ""need"" to like Ant-Man the movie, and a ""need"" to give said shebang a favorable review. Oh well, at least 1 out of 3 ""needs"" were meant. That ain't bad (oops, the saying is ""two out of three ain't bad"". Somewhere Meatloaf is complaining). Anyway, I've heard a couple of other critics talk about ""Ant"" in the same vein as last year's Guardians of the Galaxy. I honestly don't see it except for the whole sly humor- mixed-with-galloping maneuver concept. ""Galaxy"" does a reasonable job while the latter has a concoction that comes off as a bit uneven. It's corny when it should be compelling, it's action as pure exhilaration then action as completely risible (all you gotta do is watch a scene involving good versus evil via a battery powered train set), and finally, it's Paul Rudd showing us the funny instead of maybe expanding his acting repertoire. Truth be told, I didn't want another Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. I wanted Honey, I Shrunk the Badass Superhuman.<br/><br/>Referencing The Avengers multiple times, using enough CGI this side of Bruce Jenner to make Michael Douglas look thirty years younger (this was only in the first frame), and featuring a blink or you'll miss it cameo from Stan Lee (it's a Marvel Studios flick so of course), Ant-Man is something I wouldn't quite recommend. However, it's unlike any Marvel endeavor I've ever seen and heck, it's disparate from any film in general (we're talking some pretty broad territory here). It dares to be different and I give it points for that. The director is Peyton Reed. Recognized for normally helming comedies (The Break-Up, Down with Love), you wouldn't even know it was his baby had you not read ""Ant's"" dossier. He's like a new breed of action kingpin with his camera constantly moving. There are zippy flashbacks, tons of whip pans, and film pacing so earnest, the effect is dizzying. But while you admire his freewheeling technique, you wonder what he's trying to get Ant-Man to be. Was this thing intentionally meant to give off a Marvel spoof vibe? And is it a parody of the superhero/comic book genre? Oh and what's with all the out of place jokes killing much of the dramatic momentum. There was a concluding sequence where the protagonist and antagonist yelled childlike insults back and forth to each other (as shrunken human beings). I gotta confess, it was a laughable run-in that kind of made me wonder.<br/><br/>The story, which takes place monotonously in present day, subjugates thief and chronically absent father, Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd who can't shake his romcom persona thereby staying in his acting comfort zone). He's been in and out of jail, he has no job (despite being college-educated), and his daughter is watched over by his ex-wife and her jerk husband (Bobby Cannavale as Paxton. His character is well, a cop. Ouch.). When he's arrested for the umpteenth time, he's taken out of the slammer (I won't reveal how) and tapped to work for a scientist named Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Pym wants him to put on a suit, a suit which will allow him to shrink down to something the size of a penny. Here's where the ant species come into play: Lang learns to communicate with them via the guidance of the Douglas personality. They begin to act like humans and they help him steal government secrets from Pym's mentor who's also in the shrinking business (Darren Cross played by Corey Stoll). There's a robbery at a heavily secured building and as expected, chaos ensues with Rudd's Lang kicking some serious butt (I'm thinking it wasn't Pauly despite his buff physique. Come on, you knew a stuntman had to be wearing that shiny suit).<br/><br/>Now the strongest performance here, in fact comes from Stoll. He channels the obligatory archenemy. He underplays it with just the right amount of smarmy and slimy. When he executes a co-worker turning him into nothing but liquidity in a tissue, you squirm in your seat and know that he means business.<br/><br/>All in all, despite some eclectic, fistfight concatenations and a heist factor that is carried off with veritable aplomb, Ant-Man seems so small scale compared to other Marvel Studios films. I'm not saying that's a bad thing but the more you watch it, the more you forget that anything is really at stake (stuff like you know, the saving of the world or the fate of mankind hanging in the balance). There were moments to be had but it didn't possess the ""ant""idote I was looking for. My rating: 2 and a half stars.<br/><br/>Of note: So OK, as I viewed Ant-Man, I kept thinking to myself, ""this feels like a Disney movie"". Well I checked the film's wiki page and it turns out I was half-right. I mean it's not a Disney vehicle per se but it is distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Wow, you could have fooled me. This so-called Disney discern was not what I was hoping for and it came off as totally unexpected. Bummer. Also, I left during ""Ant's"" closing credits (after a midday screening) and was told that I missed an extended ending. If you the reader, end up seeing the flick, feel free to comment and let me know if it made things any better."
"DoubleOscar","8","3","11","16 July 2015"," Bigger Is Always Better? Not for Antman!
","When Ant-man was first announced I, like many other people, was very indifferent about the subject. If Marvel pulled it off, it could be great, but if they didn't, then people would start to question even further these lesser known heroes. Well I'm happy to report that Ant-man falls more towards the ""great"" category. It may not be completely flawless, but nonetheless it is very good.<br/><br/>To start, the cast is fantastic. Paul Rudd is charismatic as ever, Michael Douglas made a very compelling Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly rounded out the trio perfectly. Even Corey Stoll as Yellow Jacket, who is a bit underwritten, fit his role well. However, there is one actor who stood out from the rest. Michael Peña. Everything out of his mouth was comedy gold.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it plays out like you normal heist film with a few twists and turns. I'm a sucker for heist films and this is a great one. Following the plans of infiltration is so entertaining to watch that when the action begins, it just adds to the amount of fun the audience is having. Also, there was a surprising amount of emotional depth regarding Scott Lang and his family.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is arguably the action, which is extremely entertaining and the transitioning with the size of the characters is seamless and adds a few more laughs. <br/><br/>As for problems, there are a few but none big enough to take away from the enjoyment of the movie itself. The villain, as with most in the MCU, is pretty generic and forgettable. A few of the jokes don't hit home and seemed a little forced. Other than that, the only other problems would just be nit-picky.<br/><br/>Overall, Ant-man is a surprising enjoyable, smaller scale blockbuster that fits nicely into the rest of the MCU. The powerhouse cast is terrific together and most of the action and comedy hit right where they need to.<br/><br/>""No you can't whistle, this isn't The Andy Griffith Show."""

","Ant-Man is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters of the same name,It is the 12th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The film is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd,Evangeline Lilly,Corey Stoll,Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña,Tip ""T.I."" Harris,Anthony Mackie,Wood Harris,Judy Greer,David Dastmalchian and Michael Douglas. In Ant-Man, Lang must help defend Dr. Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications. Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang,a burglar who breaks into houses and steals stuff.He was arrested many times but now he's decided to change.Rudd is amazing in the role,he's such a nice and welcome edition to the Marvel hero canon.He's funny,charismatic and committed to the role. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym though is what makes this movie even more amazing that it already is.He is so great on the role and it's so nice to see him actually act again.Even his backstory is truly interesting and I would love to see a prequel all about him. Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne is also very good.I like that she's a strong character and does not necessarily depend on others,I really like where they are going with her character and I'm super excited to see her back in the sequel. The visual effects for this movie are mind-blowing and truly impressive.I really enjoyed the action sequences especially his final throw downs with Jellowjacket.The scope of the battles and the way they decided to direct and present them made me laugh out loud in so many occasions,especially the scene already seen in the trailers with Tomas the Train,which is hilarious and perfectly shot. There are a few story lines in this film,one of them being Scott and his daughter.I liked that story line despite most of the people saying that it felt forced and only put in the movie to make us care more about Scott Lang.I disagree actually because it absolutely did make us care but it also gave the character a reason to wear the Ant-Man suit and it truly worked. The villain in this movie (portrayed by Corey Stoll) is also a complain that I've heard quiet a lot.I disagree here also because in my opinion his intentions and motives from his back story are truly interesting and believable.I also truly liked Corey Stoll's performance and the yellowjacket suit looked glorious.He makes up for some really good looking and overall interesting fights with Ant-Man. The movie faced some problems along the production,it changed directors as it was once going to be directed by Edgar Wright but his concepts and basic story did not fit in with the MCU so they changed it and that is totally fine with me.I liked Peyton Reed's directing and style and I also like the humor in it,most of it being delivered by Michael Peña who every time he talks it's just comedy gold and I was laughing so much. I truly enjoyed Ant-Man,it is a nice and pretty different addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe,with the scale of the movie being much smaller (pun intended) and it being first and foremost a heist movie."

","This genre is not exactly the first one I reach for, though I do enjoy it from time to time. There hasn't been any super-hero movie until now that I've seen that I liked without any qualifications. Generally I find with most stories about a bunch of do-gooders running around in tights or a costume, sooner or later I can't help thinking: ""They look really silly"". Well this one worked for me from the git-go through to the de rigeur Marvel post-credits teaser. I thought every actor killed it in this especially Michael Douglas who gave it a certain wry gravitas that not every film of this type is treated to, and of course, Paul Rudd, who found the perfect note for this and ran with it. I knew the film was working for me was when I realized I was emotionally moved by the death of an ant. It's hard to argue with that."

To me it as a movie that screams innovation, in a way that is was more bright than others super-hero movies, it wasn't too dark for it's own good. <br/><br/>If they can bring a sequel without putting too much darkness on it, I want to see more of the Ant-Man, I never thought liking this movie so much."

Plus it's first time we see Michael Douglas in a superhero movie :D I could go on about the rest of the cast, but this movie is an absolute perfection of cast, characters, story, and visual and sound effects.

But what we have up there on the screen is the same pre-processed Marvel, more of the same cookie-cutter missionmaking to retrieve gadgets and avert doom, storynoise where we constantly need to have things explained to us.<br/><br/>I mean, this is a film where our hero has to infiltrate a company's HQ in time before the snarling bad guy sells the all-important thingamajig to shady agencies. 15 years ago that would have been par the course so to see the very same cartoon now that doesn't point at it but actually is that cartoon? Lazy.<br/><br/>What's left is the shrinking action and what way it paves for internal mechanics, how it transforms reality to give us views and imagination that a Mission Impossible film or Avengers won't. An early piece where he plummets through different floors shows the possibility. But we're never far off from I Shrunk the Kids territory, which was at least wholly invested in this transformation of familiar reality.<br/><br/>The climax takes place in kid's playground, we get some whimsy with small and huge toytrains. But with Fury Road and Lone Ranger in mind (as exemplars of imaginative flow) how little they achieve and what ordinary imagination. It seems the only thing the execs in control of these things care about is making sure the product is streamlined to be what customers would expect to find. Corporate."
"siderite","6","2","6","8 November 2015"," Proof that Marvel can't get everything right
","I realized what Marvel is doing. It took me a little too long to get it, but I got it: they are using movies like market shares, including using the speculative nature of market operations. It's not that they don't know people will get tired of superheroes, they just want to push as many movies in before DC does, get the money and let their competitors reap the market collapse.<br/><br/>This is the only reason why a movie like Ant-Man would be made. Not only it is about a person using a special particle to shrink or enlarge objects with no apparent effect on their functionality and interaction with other objects, but they are using these special powers in order to run around, jump and punch people.<br/><br/>But even if I were amenable to completely suspending my disbelief and believe in any crazy thing, the movie was plain bad. Unimaginative, clichéd, even a bit racist, with cardboard characters that are completely unsympathetic, the movie also belies the dated concept that spawned it. It was also a mess as a movie, with scenes from the trailers missing and people getting credit without having any scenes in the final edit.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Paul Rudd was fine, Michael Douglas was boring and bland, while the horrible wig of Evangeline Lily made us ask why we thought she was so hot when she played in Lost. Corey Stoll did the best work, even if his character was the minimal evil mad scientist with nothing else to separate him from any other paper villains. If you want to love Marvel films for a while longer, wait until the market crashes and you get into withdrawal before you watch this."
"nikhil-39604","8","2","6","19 October 2015"," Marvel delivers yet again, though not on the same scale
","Ant-Man. A man who can shrink to the size of an insect. Yes, that's right. And he communicates with ants and acts as their leader. After showcasing various colored aliens, a talking raccoon and a lovable tree (later a plant), viewers who were sceptic will be pleasantly surprised as Marvel delivers yet again, though not on a same scale. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) vows to go clean and stop breaking into places and stealing s**t. That doesn't work out and he is forced to resort to burglary (not robbery, mind you) which brings him in contact with Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a famous but reclusive scientist and his estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) who want Scott to save the world and stop his former protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) – by breaking into a highly secure research facility and stealing s**t. That's the crux of the story – a heist movie with a comic book twist, where the hero saves the world. Nothing new about that, right? But It's so much more than that. The story is about the relationship between a father and his daughter, as showcased by the strained relationship between Hank and Hope, who hates him for his withdrawn nature and for lying about her mother's death; and Scott and his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), who thinks the world of him. It is also about redemption, as Scott desperately seeks to change his ways to be with his daughter, but gets caught in the same cycle of self-sabotage and Hank who wishes to reconnect with his daughter while trying to save the world. The film also deals with legacy as Hank wants Scott to become the next Ant-Man and avoid his mistakes. Aside from being emotional, the film also is genuinely funny, with Paul Rudd and Michael Pena as his sidekick Luis stealing the spotlight with their comedy skills. Paul lights up the screen with his goofy nice guy portrayal (he is known for his comic roles), and Michael Pena charms you with his funny recollections and accent. Michael Douglas on the other hand plays his role as a grumpy old man and provides a few laughs. Corey Stoll is a tremendous actor, and brings everything he's got to Darren Cross/Yellowjacket, but as has been the case in some of the previous Marvel movies, the villain is ultimately somewhat lackluster and wants for dimension and development (Loki is still the best Marvel villain). His motivations, though clear, are ineffective, often occasionally verge on silly. Having said that, Cross actually serves to ""sell"" us on the idea of a tiny soldier. He sweeps us up with his unabashed enthusiasm for the idea and becomes another tool to coax the audience into embracing the notion of a hero the size of an insect. As for his alter ego, Yellowjacket is the catalyst for some inspired fight sequences. In fact, the action is one of the Ant-Man's greatest assets. It's innovative, often side-split-tingly funny in one moment and strung with tension the next, and is entirely motivated by story and character. The fight between Ant-Man and Falcon at the new Avengers headquarters is funny and exciting. The film has also has heist sequences but they aren't as nail-biting like the Ocean's series. Oh, and the final fight has Thomas the Tank Engine. Enough said. The film has tons of Avengers references such as when Dr. Hank Pym mocks the Iron Man suit technology and states that they are too busy because they are dropping cities from the sky (reference to Avengers 2). There is also a Spider-Man reference in the end of the movie (yay!) confirming that the wall crawler will be making an appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016). More references are hidden throughout the movie and are fun to think about. The film is however not without its flaws. Some scenes will feel clichéd, like the training montage and the final heist sequence falls flat despite being fast-paced. And the other members of Scott's thieving group aren't well developed and are stereotyped as the hacker and the getaway driver. Despite its flaws, Marvel delivers another strong standalone film with Ant-Man. As is typically the case with the studio's offerings, Ant-Man works as a showcase to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, but also delivers a straightforward, fast paced entertainer. The film doesn't require much pre-existing knowledge about the previous movies on the viewer's part. Stylistically one does feel Edgar Wright's (the director is famous for his ""Cornetto trilogy"") original concept, but the movie belongs to Peyton Reed. The affection these creators have felt for the characters is felt by the audience too. And that is what makes this movie special.<br/><br/>PS: There are cut scenes during the middle and at the end of the credits in a typical Marvel fashion. Watch out for those too."
"~AleXa~","7","2","6","6 September 2015"," Entertaining and yet underwhelming with a side of predictability
","Ant-Man (2015) Reviewed August 15th, 2015 - 1st viewing (IMAX 3D) Marvel Studios / Disney - Directed by: Peyton Reed<br/><br/>Entertaining and yet underwhelming with a side of predictability<br/><br/>From the beginning, I was thrown off kilter by the uncharacteristic opening, lacking the Marvel theme with the logo. It opens with a comedy of sorts which kind of felt like they were trying to blend the humor and wit of Guardians with the seriousness of the Cap films, but it fell flat for me. The slow beginning served to take me out of the film, wondering when it would pick up. It all felt like it'd been done before to a point, and a lot of the humor was lost due to scenes being present in the trailer.<br/><br/>For months I have been trying to figure out how Paul Rudd got cast, but now I see the character he plays is in line with his usual roles. Despite wanting to like the film, he was just lacking in charisma. Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly were captivating, and stole the show in my opinion. I was more interested in their dynamic than anything going on with Scott. I mean, let's face it—the wayward father who wants to make his little girl proud has been done before. I know they were trying to make it feel modern, but it falls short. The villain is you can call him that was so two-dimensional, predictable, and boring. I can't help but feel the writers hoped to rely on the comedic relief to carry the film over the plot hurdles instead of developing the character more.<br/><br/>Although I appreciated the Discovery Channel-style dialogue regarding different species of ants, Scott learning how to use the Ant-Man suit and work with the ants felt a bit rushed. The scene with Hank and his daughter Hope was moving, but lacked the degree of emotional depth required to truly draw us in and feel what they felt. (I didn't even tear up even though I wanted to). To be fair, it did evoke some emotion from me in that I laughed in places, but I just couldn't help feeling as though the writers did not take the time to polish this one out enough. It is also largely lacking in dynamic locations and a dramatic score, instead opting for more contemporary songs. This model can of course work as in Guardians, however everything in this film is entirely too disjointed to feel like the well-oiled machine it was intended to be.<br/><br/>You're left with a sneaking suspicion that the writers and The First Avenger and Guardians attempted to collaborate ideas for the direction of the film, and had to agree to disagree. It seems very disjointed at times, floating between you being expected to take it with a grain of salt to imploring deep emotion from you that just seems altogether forced. I expected the 'revelation' for what became of her mother—you could see it from a mile away, as well as the post-credits scene, but at least with Red Wasp, we'll have a more dynamic character to look forward to.<br/><br/>So while the film does leave you feeling entertained, it fails to provide the power, emotion, and scale we've seen in previous Marvel productions. (This marks the first Marvel film I only saw once in theaters.)<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Humorous and entertaining, albeit a bit predictable and forced. Even though it was still a decent film with its own moments, in my estimation, it is the least memorable from Marvel Studios to date.<br/><br/>6.5 of 10.0<br/><br/>Rant: Falcon in the trailer! Come on Marvel! Talk about a cheap shot to try to gain box office numbers. I will not be tolerating any of that nonsense for Civil War. That is a reveal that should've only been earned by the fans who went to see it Advance/Opening Day."
"maurice_yacowar","8","2","6","10 August 2015"," cat burglar becomes ant superhero
","The exhilarating Ant-Man is a huge advance upon The Incredible Shrinking Man and Them. But it has one credibility problem. The ultra-brilliant scientist Dr Pym (Michael Douglas) commits a serious grammatical error. He uses ""presently"" as if it means ""at present"" instead of ""soon."" No ultra-brilliant scientist would do that. But that's what our universities are coming to. Once the Humanities die will humanity be far behind? <br/><br/>But that's another film. Or is it? <br/><br/>This delightful, witty entertainment grows out of two traditions. The first is the mock- heroic, which John Dryden characterized as a very small man wearing a very very large suit of armour. In literature, that translates into a trivial issue treated as of major importance. Examples of the mock epic include Pope's The Rape of the Lock. <br/><br/>The very concept of the film is mock heroic. As the giant screen swarms with huge figures of superhuman strength, hulking hunks and tower-sized robots, it was only a matter of time before the estimable Marvel comics would proffer a mini-hero. As Superman begat Mighty Mouse the 3-D behemoths bred Ant-Man. The empowered hero Scott Lang is played by the usually nebbish Paul Rudd, who would usually out-nebbish Clark Kent, except for his extraordinary cleverness as a cat burglar — with a pussy's idealism. <br/><br/>Instead of empowering the weak the essential fantasy in this film is restoring father- daughter relationships. Scott is an ex-con frustrated in his attempt to see his daughter, post-divorce. Dr Pym lost his daughter, the aptly-named Hope (Evangeline Lilly), who now works for his arch-enemy and ex-mentee Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). As the scientist, daughter and ex-con join forces to save the world from an army of evil miniatures, the fathers win back their daughters and a second-generation romance promises to avoid past freezes and neglect. Cross lives out the son's rebellion against his surrogate father figure.<br/><br/>The second tradition reflects the current global military dread. The drama centers on the use of destructive power. As Pym observes, you can't destroy power, just learn to control it. Most films present the war between good and evil as clashes between armies, nations, even cultures. Individual heroes may face off to settle the issue, but wars are between armies. <br/><br/>By miniaturizing the war this film makes the army subordinate to the individual. True, Ant-Man commands an entomologist's dream of obedient battalions, but that just puts him in harmony with nature, contra all the other bombers. (In further harmony, there is even music by Adam and the Ants.) This war is between the goodie Ant-Man and the baddie Yellowjacket. Ant-Man's mobility seems trumped by Yellowjacket's laser shots, at least till he's zapped himself by a patio light. Here the villain is a solitary shooter not a commander of men. That is, Ant-Man here fights off our current dread, the outlaw loner, the suicide bomber, the terrorist cell. Ant-Man may be a familiar kind of hero but his opponent — and the nightmare he personifies — is the dread evil of our times."
"aharmas","10","2","6","26 July 2015"," A Thrilling Hero
","Just when you thought it was Marvel overkill, here comes a hero that is worth paying attention to because the premise is FUN, and there is probably not a better cast film this year. Paul Rudd perfectly embodies the newly minted hero, a scientific wonder who can switch between insect size (while retaining full-size super powers and speed), and at the same time working with a team of artificial swarms.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" goes beyond the action and super-power to infuse the story with plenty of humanity and humour. We have the silly exchanges with the Michael Pena character (very funny performance), and it's fun to concentrate the villain back to one single character, with a defined malevolent goal, gleefully portrayed by Corey Stoll, who appears to have a good time while reaching for his ultimate goal to destroy his former mentor.<br/><br/>One of the highlights in ""Ant-Man"" involves the family relationships, shaded by affection and jealousy. Father and daughter relationships mirror each other. Douglas and Lilly are excellent in their dynamics of a flawed bond, and it's interesting to see how Rudd's character is bound for the same problems, unless he changes gears.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" makes judicious use of special effects, which help the student move forward and keep the action full of energy. Here's a miniature universe, full of energy and believability, and we finally we see a villain mutate into a creation that is threatening and worth of our admiration. ""Yellowjacket"" might be gone here, but we sure hope he's brought back in some fashion.<br/><br/>This film doesn't leave me yearning for comic books or wondering why the technology went haywire, killing some of the originality and humanity of the special universe. I'm glad ""Ant-Man"" is now part of the Marvel Universe and will be joining the Avengers in whatever new enterprise is coming up, and I certainly celebrate Lilly's upcoming turn as the other insect superhero. It's time to celebrate."

","I really enjoy that Marvel movies don't just stick with one genre. Just as Captain America was a war movie and a superhero movie, this is a heist movie and superhero movie. (Meanwhile at DC) It's pretty hard to get excited about a superhero who's only powers are shrinking and controlling ants. Especially because the original Ant-Man is not the main character, so if you're not familiar with the comics you may be confused. It's a different kind of Marvel movie. The theme of passing the torch has not yet been seen in any Marvel film. I loved that we've got the original hero passing on his legacy to a guy who really needs to change his life for the better. This has everything we've come to expect from an MCU movie. Humor, action, a good story, and cameos for the fans. It's reminded me of Guardians of the Galaxy, a lot. And that's a good thing, because I enjoyed that movie a lot. It's because of this movie that Paul Rudd will forever be known as Small Rudd. It's not the best MCU movie, (so far, that's Captain America: The Winter Soldier), but it is a fun little movie that will be known as a gamble that Marvel took, that paid off in the long run.<br/><br/>Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

"ikjonesv","8","1","2","18 March 2019"," Should Be A Bigger Part of the MCU
","This for me is without a doubt one of the best MCU films. If not Marvel films in general, to come out in recent years. But this film is riddled with plot holes. With an intelligently written, charming and hilarious script. My main worries were how they would introduce Ant-Man since in the comics, he would not be suitable for the MCU. They did manage to nail it. Originally Hank Pym was going to be the Ant-Man in the movie. Favorably they changed since there was a lot of controversy with the storylines surrounding Hank Pym in the comics. They did add him as a secondary character because he is a pretty huge part of Marvel either way. The opening was incredible. The film was very unpredictable. I loved the scenes where it presented the plot twist. I was very surprised to see a different superhero other than Ant-Man in the film. Anthony Mackie's Falcon appeared and it was a surprise - I feel like we don't get enough of the lower tier Avengers in these movies.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd played the protagonist Ant-Man, under the name of Scott Lang. He was hilarious in his role. And I can't wait to see him in future MCU films. I loved his aim. Unfortunately, the antagonist did not have a clear goal. Corey Stoll played Yellow Jacket. He was fine nothing incredibly impressive. The other side characters were Hope and Hank Pym - they were played by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly. Their backstory was incredible. I did think the relationship between Hope and Scott was ominous - I don't know why. Michael Peña was a nice addition to the film and he was phenomenal. An amazing way to introduce the Wasp and the Quantum Realm.<br/><br/>I loved about this movie was its use of CGI and special effects with him shrinking. Some great fighting scenes, especially the one in which they make the colossal train. The age of the movie should be PG, for violence and mild language instead of 12. As I mentioned earlier, stuffed with giant plot holes. How does he manage to climb on a gun when small, even though according to the movie's physics - when he shrinks his original density stays the same? I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I love this movie."
"leftistcritic","5","1","2","14 January 2019"," Superhero movie not like the others
","Ant-Man is a bit of a different movie than others I have seen. Sure, it is not like Deadpool, but it does have an interesting aspect: a superhero who does not have superpowers, a bit like Batman & Robin, Iron Man, or Spider Man who each depend on their gadgets but have no superpowers of their own. In that way, this movie sorta reminded me of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Still, it does not subvert the superhero genre but carefully stays inside of it, even tying to the Avengers, even though commanding ants with gadgets is kinda cool. The movie did not have the strongest plot though, with the typical ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" who worked on a government project, and it could have been more developed. For instance, at one point Michael Douglas breaks out of the lab with a big tank, and the helicopter with Corey Stoll and his henchmen. I don't understand why the tank doesn't fire at the helicopter, blowing it up, killing Stoll, rather than Paul Rudd as Ant Man leading the ants to attack. But, plots of these movies don't always make sense.<br/><br/>So this wasn't the worst movie I saw, but if it was between this and other superhero movies (apart from Deadpool), I would recommend this one. Paul Rudd does a good portrayal as Ant-Man and Michael Douglas (as Hank Pym) is always good. While Evangeline Lilly as Hope is good, as is Bobby Cannavale as Paxto, among others, Michael Pina as Luis is annoying. I know he is supposed to be comic relief but he is more annoying than anything else.<br/><br/>With all that is why I rate this film 5 stars."

","4/4<br/><br/>The first time I ever saw this movie was in the theatres on my birthday. This movie has held up over time amazingly, as I have had multiple screening of it since. Marvel's smash-hit ""fun sized"" hero, the Ant-Man has an original and hilarious take on heroism that really can't be missed. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd really brings a comic-book honoring preformance and accessibility to mass-audiences in his role as Scott Lang. He's an every-man disguised in an ant suit. He's the criminal, hero, father, and bro combo package working with the ""old-man-with-a-past"" Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) against the ""evil-capitalist"" Darren Cross. Along for the ride is Pym's ""hot daughter"" Hope (Evangeline Lilly, nice to see her in more than LOST and The Hobbit) and Scott's unwitting pals Luis, Dave and Kirt (Michael Peña, T.I., David Dastmalchian). Every character (and their actor) is truly great and compliments the others well.<br/><br/>What makes Ant-Man better in the ranks of Marvel's many movies to date is its balanced sense of genre. The action is smooth, the emotion is real, and the humor is, well... very funny to say the least. It will definetely be interesting to see how this characters ages in the MCU.<br/><br/>Most superheroes don't have as much going on as poor Scotty. He is juggling trying to be a father, a life of small-time crime, and getting tangled in the aftermath of one of Pym's soiled relationships with a former pupil. He can still pack one hell of a punch when he downsizes, and that's why he's great.<br/><br/>To say that this is one of Marvel's best yet is more than fair. Not many heroes (in Marvel's wonderful universe, DC's not-so-wonderful universe, or anywhere else) capture both the depth of a man and his arguably shallow antics. Ant-Man is a true winner."

Marvel Studios confirmed my faith once again! They presented ANT-MAN seamlessly into the greater Marvel Universe and gave viewers fun, memorable characters. The plot is simple but well played out. Paul Rudd is GREAT in this role and Michael Pena provides wonderfully funny moments as the sidekick. Michael Douglas does a good Hank Pym and Corey Stoll has just the right amount of villainy as Yellow Jacket. Evangeline Lilly is OK in her role as Hope Van Dyne. She does a lot of open-mouthed gaping, so don't paint me as someone impressed with her acting ability. It could have been how her character was written but I think it's telling that she's not reprising the role in the anticipated sequel.

","The title of the movie sounds like a joke but the way it's executed is excellent. Antman was more enjoyable than Man of Steel. Comedian Paul Rudd jumps into this suit that can make him really small and give all the power on earth to control the ants so as to finish missions. Michael Douglas plays the authoritative Hank Pym, the scientist who invented the substance that can change sizes.<br/><br/>When Hollywood movies are beyond technical flaws, the 3D experience does give us the third eye and an extra edge to watch this world. With lots of scientific terminologies being explained, ant-man has a very simple yet interesting writing to it. Lots of organic comedy combined with bits and pieces of action drama. Notable performances from the lead cast and especially the quirky team of three sidekicks of Scott brings lot of laughter with Michael Pena in the role of Luis leading the pack. Mind-blowing facts about the ants, instances where the new ant-man gets trained and not forgetting the mega action block towards the end, Ant-man has lots of engaging moments to rejoice while there are also some intense scenes dwelling on the emotions of the characters.<br/><br/>8/10 from me!"

Never a dull moment. Either filled with action or humor. The kind of movie worth seeing at the movies. I'm actually surprised that it didn't make more money than it did.

","Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has recently been released from prison and vows to put his life of crime behind him in order to improve relations with his daughter. Despite his attempts to reform, Lang is lured back into a life of crime and burgles the home of millionaire Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). However, Lang burgling Hank's home was no accident and was part of Hank's plan to offer Lang a shot at redemption; a plan which involves a daring heist where Lang is able to put his 'cat-burgling' skills to good use by stopping Hank's soon-to-be son-in-law Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) from unleashing one of Hank's creations (technology which Hank considered too dangerous to be used and therefore tried to keep it a secret) giving both Lang and Pym the chance to save the world.<br/><br/>Superhero films in general are always a bit hit-and-miss as far as I'm concerned, but with Ant-Man it's definitely an example of a superhero film that gets more wrong than right....<br/><br/>First and foremost the tone is generally correct and although it does have some mushy sentiment it mostly remains a fun ride (Michael Pena is the 'comic relief' character here and to his credit he is actually pretty funny). The film is also fairly well-paced and although it's close to two hours long it never feels padded out or laborious and the film generally flows well from scene to scene. Director Peyton Reed does a fairly solid job overall; the special effects are impressive, but more importantly Reed uses the special effects appropriately (they're mostly used for the audience to gain an insight into what it's like being Ant-Man so it never feels like Reed is showing off at any point).<br/><br/>The performances from the main players are good; Rudd has a natural charm about him and can make even the most pathetic of losers appear likable (which is exactly what he does here). Douglas is OK here, but I did feel that he was somewhat 'slumming it' a bit here (he's capable of much better). All other performances were adequate although as previously mentioned Pena's character and good acting raise the bar a little bit for this film (he's a diverse and very underrated actor).<br/><br/>The film isn't entirely perfect though;for example Cross' world-domination scheme is established at the beginning and appears to be an important part of the story, but then it seems to get pretty much ignored until right near the end - I appreciate that this was so that the audience could see Lang's training and development, but it probably would have been better if the film would have had a bit more balance between Cross' plotting and Lang's training - this isn't a big criticism as the training aspect was a lot of fun, but I just found the film structurally a little uneven.<br/><br/>On balance, Ant-Man is well worth your time as it is fast-paced film with a generally humorous tone and it provides the audience with a fairly novel concept. For me though it's the sense of fun and likability that Ant-Man brings that won me over in the end."
"Muhammad_Nd","9","1","2","14 July 2016"," A Thrilling Hero
","Just when you thought it was Marvel overkill, here comes a hero that is worth paying attention to because the premise is FUN, and there is probably not a better cast film this year. Paul Rudd perfectly embodies the newly minted hero, a scientific wonder who can switch between insect size (while retaining full-size super powers and speed), and at the same time working with a team of artificial swarms.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" goes beyond the action and super-power to infuse the story with plenty of humanity and humour. We have the silly exchanges with the Michael Pena character (very funny performance), and it's fun to concentrate the villain back to one single character, with a defined malevolent goal, gleefully portrayed by Corey Stoll, who appears to have a good time while reaching for his ultimate goal to destroy his former mentor.<br/><br/>One of the highlights in ""Ant-Man"" involves the family relationships, shaded by affection and jealousy. Father and daughter relationships mirror each other. Douglas and Lilly are excellent in their dynamics of a flawed bond, and it's interesting to see how Rudd's character is bound for the same problems, unless he changes gears.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" makes judicious use of special effects, which help the student move forward and keep the action full of energy. Here's a miniature universe, full of energy and believability, and we finally we see a villain mutate into a creation that is threatening and worth of our admiration. ""Yellowjacket"" might be gone here, but we sure hope he's brought back in some fashion.<br/><br/>This film doesn't leave me yearning for comic books or wondering why the technology went haywire, killing some of the originality and humanity of the special universe. I'm glad ""Ant-Man"" is now part of the Marvel Universe and will be joining the Avengers in whatever new enterprise is coming up, and I certainly celebrate Lilly's upcoming turn as the other insect superhero. It's time to celebrate."

","It's been a while since I watched a flick about superhero's. The reason is simple, mostly those flicks clock in over 2 hours and do have a lot of boring moments. Didn't know what to expect from Ant-Man but I gave it a try due Michael Douglas being in it and Corey Stoll who I knew from the stunning series The Strain. But was I surprised when it was over, this was excellent.<br/><br/>There wasn't any part that bored me and the story itself was rather good. Even when the ants came in I thought this is going to suck real hard well it was again excellent. Towards the end there's a fight between good and evil and even that looked great. But what did offer this flick for me that made it great was a bit of humour here and there and of course the excellent performances highlighted by Douglas.<br/><br/>On part of the effects it was one of the best I've seen in a superhero flick.

If the previous attached director Edgar Wright was the actual director it could have turned into one of the better super hero films of all time and it would have have been unique in every way. <br/><br/>The story is quite good, and has a good development. There's a lot of clichés though, but they are the good ones, and the films overall charm makes you forget them, a bit. The dialogue is also good. There's an amazing part in the film to connect to the marvel universe, though it feels a little bit forced, its so cool you forget that. <br/><br/>The film could have higher stakes, though the films small stakes are part of its charm and what sets it apart from other marvel films.<br/><br/>The characters are good, but the cast obviously is what makes the characters cool and a lot more interesting. The villain is marvel formula, clichéd and bland, but the actor that portrays him makes it a lot more interesting and memorable.<br/><br/>There's plenty of comedy, but little action though. This is more a thriller than an action film, but the few action scenes though small in scope are big in entertainment.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is a quite good film, has tons of charm, thanks in great part to his incredible charismatic cast, and stands as one of the most anti-marvel formula, it feels fresh. But you never can shake the feeling that tons of possibilities are being wasted. The premise has tons of possibilities to make highly interesting and original plots, and some of the most inventive, creative, unique and entertaining action scenes ever. <br/><br/>The film goes for the most conventional things though. But once again, thanks to its charm its hard not to like Ant-Man."

","Best thing about this film is that it bucks the trend of recent Marvel films: it actually has real conversations and, gosh, sometimes minutes go back without any special effects. <br/><br/>It was pretty much what I expected: likable actors (and the villain was well drawn as well), the shrinking scenes were different from other superhero special effects, and the humour was...humorous. All in all, it's closer to the feeling of original comics than recent efforts and I liked that.<br/><br/>Don't expect to be surprised: Marvel don't do that anymore.

"Paynebyname","7","3","12","22 July 2015"," A solid, enjoyable and entertaining film
","I have to say that I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Maybe my expectations were a little lower going in than they had been for Ultron and hence I wasn't therefore disappointed. It felt like a perfect counterpoint to Ultron's over crammed roster and bombastic filled to the gunnels approach.<br/><br/>It was smaller, it was more intimate and it was more fun. Rudd, Douglas and Pena were great to see and I enjoyed their interactions. The scenes with Falcon were good and I like the angle of Ant man potentially being the fly in the ointment and being slightly off the grid of the Avengers.<br/><br/>It sat nicely in the MCU and I liked the fact that Pym was a little dismissive of the Avengers. I think a bit of rivalry or ego between inventors has a useful place.<br/><br/>I agree that the bad guy felt a little underdeveloped though I respected the makers showing him turning people and animals into gloop before he perfected his technique. The romance angle felt a bit tenuous and I think I would have preferred if they hadn't gone down that angle.<br/><br/>There were less action scenes than a normal Marvel film but this then gave them more weight when they did happen and I really enjoyed the going big and going small transitions. I really liked the fight in a briefcase and the one in Cassie's room.<br/><br/>Even though the going sub atomic scene had been telegraphed, I still enjoyed how he was punching his way through the layers of the Hornets suit as he shrank giving him a particularly unpleasant death. Him getting out of the sub atomic zone was also nicely handled with using the previously established 'make big' discs.<br/><br/>I concede that the film wasn't the greatest but it was more satisfying than Ultron and better than Thor 2. The character is intriguing and as playing a real every man (Falcon does have military training) I'm really interested in seeing how he interacts with other members of the Avengers and future Marvel films.<br/><br/>A solid effort 7.5 out of 10."
"grayremnant1","7","3","12","17 July 2015"," Marvel Embraces Comedy While Ignoring Science
","Ant-Man is not your typical Marvel film. Most Marvel movies exist in a universe where the bounds of science are pushed, while comedic elements are incorporated sparsely throughout the film. Ant-Man is different in that science is completely disregarded, while comedy runs rampant throughout the film. This, as it turns out, was actually a really good idea.<br/><br/>Who needs all that science crap, when we can just watch hilarity unfold and laugh ourselves silly? Most of the time I would ask that sarcastically, but after seeing Ant-Man I suddenly understand the appeal.<br/><br/>With Ant-Man, Marvel has made a statement. Marvel films are based in fantasy, not reality. The science in Ant-Man is mindbogglingly unrealistic, but on the other hand, it's one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Marvel has decided that they're not going to be limited by the laws of physics, and that comedy is more valuable than drama.<br/><br/>Simply put, Marvel has doubled down and embraced its silliness, and that's a good thing. It's better to be cinematically pure, than to try to please everybody. Rather than worrying about realism, Marvel is more concerned with making smart characters that make rational decisions in an unrealistic world. The science is all wrong, but the character's decisions are completely fine.<br/><br/>I can forgo scientific errors, mainly because they exist in the background. It's easy to forget about how particles actually work, and just embrace the madness of Ant-Man's ridiculous shrinking suit. It's hard to get over people doing things that they would never realistically do; things that move the plot in the direction the writers want.<br/><br/>Marvel's good at avoiding that because they keep the plot simple, and just let the ball roll down hill, rather than constantly pulling strings. The characters don't need to make ridiculous decisions to move the plot along because the plot moves all by itself. I can't tolerate it when a character does something stupid like walking into a cage that houses an incredibly dangerous animal just to inspect some claw marks on the wall (yes, I'm talking to you Jurassic World!).<br/><br/>Ant-Man is a movie about characters. The suit isn't the star of the film. The physics aren't important. What is important is that every character stay true to him/herself and provide wit and clever dialogue to keep the audience intrigued. That's what Marvel has accomplished here.<br/><br/>This is a new milestone in the MCU, one that incorporates the simplicity of Iron Man, the humor of Guardians of the Galaxy, and the stellar character interactions of The Avengers. Aside from the scientific inaccuracies, this film is highly entertaining and well worth watching. For all its problems, it more than makes up for it in laughs."
"gianlucamarzano16","10","3","12","16 July 2015"," Is it too late to change the name?
","Ant-man is directed by Peyton Reed and stars Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Corey Stoll, and Evangeline Lilly. It's about Scott Lang,(Paul Rudd)a skilled burglar who's given a second chance by Hank Pym(Michael Douglas)to get his life back together and be with his daughter. First off,Ant-man was originally supposed to be directed by Edgar Wright for a long time and than he's wasn't directing it. At that point the movie seemed to go downhill but than Peyton Reed got it and I'm glad to say the final product was amazing. The acting is fantastic by everyone. Paul Rudd played his role great, Michael Douglas was also great as always, and Michael Peña was very funny. It was great they didn't over use him. What made Ant-man amazing was the camera work when Ant-man shrieked down. Peyton Reed did an amazing job of showing how big everything is when your that small. The action was also fantastic, every action scene was shot so perfectly. There was surprising a lot humor and it worked great. Overall Ant-man was a fun superhero action movie with lots of humor, and it fits in with all the other marvel movies. Definitely worth checking out."
"ptcarr","8","2","7","26 July 2015"," An Underdog Of A Film Fails To Disappoint
","Like a good number of people, I was skeptical about Ant-Man since I heard about its development two or three years ago. Ant-Man is a strange, lame superhero, and I was confused as to how Marvel could create a two hour film full of consistently entertaining ant-related action. But that's exactly what Peyton Reed, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish have given us. Ant-Man is a well-paced and exciting film which wins on just about every front. The acting is superb. The special effects are neither overwhelming to the point of distracting or underwhelming to the point of ridiculousness. The story is persistent with very few, if any, weak spots.<br/><br/>Michael Douglass and Corey Stoll were both mesmerizing. It was a bit of a change for Stoll, who played a weak, alcoholic puppet of a governor in House of Cards, to portray the manipulative and evil Dr. Cross, but he skillfully pulls it off. Douglass very authentically presents himself as a man desperate to not see his work's secrets be used against him. He has just the right amount of sentiment and concern to be perfectly believable.<br/><br/>Rudd, on the other hand, left a bit to be desired. While he portrays the emotions needed to portray Scott Lang very well, and his humorous quips between action sequences are well delivered, he simply doesn't come off as a superhero type. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was one of the best casting decisions marvel has ever made. Downey is also a master of delivering funny banter with precision and skill, but during serious scenes, he presents himself as cool, confident, and powerful. He masters both personalities beautifully, which is one of the reasons he has been so well-received as an actor. Paul Rudd is a humorous banter kind of actor, but he's not always the cool, confident, superhero kind of actor. He doesn't come off as a thief who spent three years in prison. He doesn't come off as someone who would attack an Avenger with very little provocation. The pain he feels at not being able to see his daughter just seems a bit lacking. This just wasn't his niche role.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I like the idea of having Lang's daughter be the central motivator for the hero. Something like this is rarely done in Marvel films; the motivation is usually some inherent drive to do good for the sake of doing good. This doesn't come across with Lang, a burglar who continues to pal around with petty criminals even after being repeatedly pushed to turn his life around. I like that change; another generic superhero backstory had a good chance of coming off as boring.<br/><br/>The film is also visually appealing. The sterile white lab worker's coats and equipment in Dr. Pym's laboratory contrast strikingly with Dr. Cross's dark and menacing exterior. The shots of Lang as he flies around on Antony are sensational and playfully disorienting. Lang's 2001: A Space Odyssey-esque journey through the quantum realm is beautiful and vivid.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is a well-directed, well-acted, and well-told piece of work. Congratulations to Ant-Man for exceeding expectations."
"samgiannn","6","2","7","18 July 2015"," ""Ant-Man"" Dares to Be Different
","I'm not one for big action spectacles where we see New York getting destroyed for the four-millionth time, so I'm always a little worried before I go into a superhero movie. Fortunately, Ant-Man dared to be different than the usual superhero flick like the largely overrated Avengers and abysmal Man of Steel by being a heist movie. Ant-Man, based on the Marvel character, Scott Lang has to use Dr. Pym's Ant- Man suit and plot a heist to stop Darren Cross from making more Ant-Man suits. The suit itself allows the wearer to shrink to the size of an ant while their physical strength increases, making them a virtually unstoppable force. The worst thing I can say about Ant-Man is that it's not as neat and controlled as Marvel's best entries. It doesn't match the tight story of Iron Man or the thrilling nature of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it makes up for that by being an incredibly fun and sometimes unpredictable heist movie. A majority of the film is dedicated to showing how Lang attempts to pull of the heist rather than showing non-stop action. It makes Ant-Man feel unique and significantly different than any other Marvel movie I've seen. Most of the action doesn't happen until the final act of the film, but the scenes themselves are very interesting since you see Lang and Cross constantly growing and shrinking. There's also quite a bit of comedy in there, which unfortunately, misses a lot more than it hits. Nevertheless, Ant-Man is an appropriately fun and unique superhero movie that actually tries to tell a story rather than showing fifty skyscrapers fall to the ground."

Michael Douglas was good in it reminded me of the way Michael Caine can just play himself in everything but its still always good. Paul Rudd Was Fantastic in this bringing a lot of humor and some decent acting to the table, i cant picture anyone else nailing such an obscure character like Ant-Man the way he did. Evangeline Lily and Bobby Cannavale were both good in there roles. T.I., David Dastmaichain and Juddy Greer were all very funny in smaller roles. But by far and away the best most surprising Actor was Michael Pena who killed his Role in this film he was the best overall and most funny person in this whole movie. The Directing, production, soundtrack, editing, effects, stunts, writing were all great. This movie has a good story like with a good plot i have to say its one of the better marvel movies in the MCU in my opinion it felt like a Mash up of Guardians of the Galaxy and Iron Man which are to of my favorite movies let alone just superhero/comic movies. overall this movie is a 7.5 out of 10 which i cant give it due to stars so its a 4 out of 5 i recommend this movie to anyone its a perfect cross over of comedy adventure action and superhero movies so if you like any of those genres i cant see why you wouldn't like this movie."

Paul Rudd's likability serves Scott Lang well, there are some terrific character dynamics between various characters (the Lang and Pym family relationships in particular give the film heart, a quality which is sometimes in short supply in Marvel films). There is a lot of humour – no doubt a legacy of Edgar Wright's and Joe Cornish's input – there are fairly obvious fingerprints throughout the movie. The effects are absolutely fine, with the way the action narrative copes with showing things from both the macro and micro points of view being particularly well achieved.<br/><br/>I have seen 3 criticisms – one, that the ants aren't particularly well individualised. Come on, they're ants. And, two, that Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne should have been a stranger female. Well, one, she was, two that was part of the plot and, three, hold on for Ant-Man 2!

"natrc2003","5","2","8","12 December 2015"," Just Another Superhero Cartoon
","This movie exemplifies the entire problem with the glut of Superhero films these days -- they're basically extremely expensive cartoons. Which is fine, if you're five years old and still able to identify with an animated figure, suspend one's belief and go along for the ride. But as an adult, Ant-man, like most of the other Marvel vehicles in the last decade, just falls flat.<br/><br/>When 80 percent of the film -- and 100 percent of the action -- is CGI, there is absolutely no suspense, no sensation that the characters are truly at risk. It's the equivalent of watching a Roadrunner cartoon. Sure, it's funny. But it's no more than that. And a Roadrunner cartoon is only a couple minutes long. Not nearly two hours.<br/><br/>The only thing that can possibly make these CGI films work is the casting - a well-cast actor is still able to overcome the flatness of CGI (Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Robert Downey in the first Iron Man). In the case of Ant-man, however, the cast just feels like a B-team. Paul Rudd's a far better schlubby sad-sack rom-com sidekick than superhero, and the rest of the cast, primarily TV actors, makes this film feel like a made-for-TV movie. (This was especially problematic in the case of Corey Stoll, who is best known for his role as a loser alcoholic - very hard to take him seriously as the villain!)<br/><br/>I found it particularly hilarious when the showed off Rudd's ""new buff"" body -- I sure hope that was CGI too, because he truly looked ridiculous.<br/><br/>But this is another huge problem with the Marvel films. They take themselves far too seriously. It would be a lot easy to sit back and enjoy the CGI if the films would laugh at themselves a bit more."

"cgweinstein","8","2","8","19 August 2015"," Ant-Man - An Unexpected Success From Marvel
","Ant-Man (2015) directed by Peyton Reed PG-13<br/><br/>Ant-Man is yet another marvel movie, but this time with quite a few tricks up its sleeve. Instead of starring a muscular boring hunk, it stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang a.k.a Ant-Man himself, for example. But the biggest twist you can see earlier on and probably know about is the size of its hero, in particular how small he is. However the movie shows that It doesn't have to rely on a gimmick to work.<br/><br/>First of all, I want to say I had my doubts about this film, mainly with Edgar Wright. When I heard that the writer and director of The World's Ends and several other films that I was dying to see one of these days was writing it, I got excited. Joss Whedon himself (the director of The Avengers, and Avengers: Age of Ultron) said that the script Wright turned in was great, I was ready for the first truly superb marvel superhero flick, since the original Iron Man back in 2008. But, then news broke out that Edgar Wright left the project after creative feuds with Marvel and my anticipation halted to an abrupt stop. Since everyone loves this guy's ideas then Marvel must have been wrong to cut ties with him, and while they may have been, they certainly did not make a bad film, its quite the contrary actually. <br/><br/>First of all I'd like to say that Marvel Studios has finally made a blockbuster that I can proudly say is hilarious. It's filled with inevitably soon-to-be quotable lines, silly imagery, and surprisingly sometimes witty storytelling. Sure, there may not have been a single moment in which I was uncontrollably laughing, but there were definitely laugh out loud moments. For example Michael Douglas has a line that is unexpected enough that it got an amazing giggle out of me. But, the real highlight is a couple of the subplots and little stories Scott's friends tell. These scenes in particular have near perfect editing and sitcom qualities that merge successfully with the story being told. They provide entertaining diversions from the story seemingly, but at the same time the two times they are used, they have a clear reason for them. This is one of the funniest movies of the year.<br/><br/>The performances are rock solid in this film for the most part. Paul Rudd while seemingly playing himself, he throws in more emotion and heart then what he would usually be asked of for any movie. While in terms of comedy, he may be serving up the same cup of tea, an exceptional one at that, never has Rudd been this serious in a movie, even though he may be the biggest goof ball in the entire movie. It proves that Rudd has a place to stay in Hollywood, and could take his shot at significantly more dramatic roles. The scene stealer though is Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man. Douglas delivers every line he has with depth, every line has character, charm, distinctness, and emotion to it. He has one of the best voices in Hollywood and puts it to affect quite well. Every line he has is well written, yet has a comic book like feel to it. His performance is exceptional for what it is. The one weak link in the cast is Corey Stoll as Darren Cross a.k.a Yellowjacket. Stoll is a fine actor in general its just his character is so bland, unoriginal, simplistic, and most of all boring that he can't seem to pull out anything worthy of a film. He doesn't add anything to his character, and honestly doesn't do a good job at proving why no other actor could have played his role just as good as him. But, this isn't to big a deal, when the film has some of the best comic book performances in recent memory.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film though, is what any memorable blockbuster's biggest selling point should be, it's action. Using the size of its lead character, Marvel has made creative action sequences that incorporate both humor and super hero qualities.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is one of the best blockbusters of the 2015 summer. It is funny, it's got excellent performances for the most part, and it has great action scenes. Ant-Man get's a B+."

","""We have so many big men fighting this war. Maybe all we need now is a little guy."" - Dr. Abraham Erskine (Captain America: The First Avenger)<br/><br/>Never can those very words be more ironically fitting for this newest MCU entry than any other film in the series. After the huge hit that was ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", Marvel decides to take things back to basics and start Phase 3 with probably the most unlikely superhero imaginable. A great deal of skepticism surrounded this film on whether or not it would be successful, let alone be accepted by general audiences. There was also the concern of a change in directors due to conflicting views of how the story would be presented. Normally, this would cause a film to fail (prime example being the 1998 GODZILLA) but, in an unexpected twist, this film gained a positive reception and after seeing it in theaters, it's easy to understand why.<br/><br/>Plot: Dr. Hank Pym, the first Ant Man, creates technology revolving around the miraculous ""Pym particle"", a formula that allows the user to shrink to the size of an insect while still retaining incredible strength and use tech to control ants. However, fearing what this could do to the world in the wrong hands, he keeps it a secret. As a result, his bitter former protégé Darren Cross not only takes away Pym's company, but also decides to try and recreate this power in the form of the Yellowjacket suit and sell it off to some unsavory parties. Wanting to prevent a global disaster, Pym takes under his wing Scott Lang, a skilled thief who wishes to better himself for his daughter. With the help of Pym, his own distant daughter Hope, and an army of fierce ants, Scott sets out to perfect his newfound powers and steal back the technology from Darren as the new Ant Man! <br/><br/>Similar to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", this whole idea sounds ridiculous on paper, but likewise the film is somewhat self-aware of this and just has fun with it while still making the story and drama substantial. The comedy is executed well, making me laugh multiple times, a lot of that being due to Paul Rudd's and Michael Peña's performances. The effects and actions scenes are definitely the highlight of the film. Ant Man's power to shrink brings some refreshing visuals in terms of scale and the fight scenes are very well-choreographed, especially one involving a certain Avenger. I also like how this movie uses different species of ants, already such amazing animals, and on top of that, each species has its own unique abilities to assist the hero. The climax where it's Ant Man vs Yellowjacket is definitely one of the best in MCU, with all the aforementioned aspects harmoniously coming into play.<br/><br/>The characters are all great. Scott Lang/Ant Man is such a likable protagonist, someone who, despite losing his way from time to time, can improvise and push himself to become something more, especially for his daughter, who by the way is such an adorable kid. He can also surprisingly hold himself well in a fight and with his wit, suit, and ants to assist him, he's a force to be reckoned with. Hank Pym makes for a great mentor figure, just as witty and resourceful as Scott. In the comics, he's got lots of issues but this version presents this trait in a way that makes him heart-felt and sympathetic rather than aggravating. Hope is also a character that has some complexity to her and her relationship with her father is a great parallel to Scott and his own daughter. The villain Darren Cross/Yellowjacket is a pretty simple villain, cruel yet charismatic, but still threatening enough and having a fairly understandable motivation, not to mention that his suit packs some nasty firepower.<br/><br/>While the film does start out a little slow, once it gets going, it's a thrill to watch. With fun characters, exciting action, hilarious comedy, great visuals, nice twists, and a few good themes, Ant Man does not disappoint in almost every way. I look forward to seeing more of the insect-themed hero in future MCU films."
"itsachfigueroa68","8","2","8","28 July 2015"," Very unexpected
","I went with couple friend after waiting almost two week after the release day and we were very surprise to what we found.<br/><br/>I am a Marvel universe Fan , so I was not expecting nothing except the best of the best. From the star you could have just a tease of what is coming for Agent Carter and how the Agent of Shield were build and the that Hydra was already in the background. I love the way they make the character how do they build them thru out the hall movie. I will confess that when I knew that they choice Paul Rudd as Ant-Man I was kind of disappointment, he is a comedian and we have all see him as a funny man, but on Ant-Man I was able to see far more that just imagine he was funny but at the same time he created a new Ant-Man for the viewers. Evangeline Lilly was great as always on her performers. The Drama was dragging at the begging and I couldn't figure out until after the first 20 minutes of the movie but a soon he just accept put on the Suit that were the entertainment begging.<br/><br/>The End was very Funny and make me wonder about Phase 3 in the Marvel Universe and they didn't leave me hanging like they have done in the last couple movies from Marvel. So we all know that Evangeline is the Wasp with that lovely part that she is controlling the Ants like she was born to do that. But the one that got to me was the one with Cap and Falcon with Bucky at old shop , but it as we all should know Cap doesn't trust Tony since he was very clear that he didn't want Tony to know about Bucky and if I recall DR.Hank said to Scott that he didn't want Tony Stark to have his hand on his Suit that definitely is let us know that something is wrong with Tony (Iron Man). Let see where this lead us and with great hopes that Captain American Civil world would be even better than captain America winter solder but so far none of the Marvel movies after Winter Solder has done the impact that this one did on the marvel universe."

The humor was good,the acting was top-notch, and the directing and action scenes were pretty cool.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking a good way to pass some time, grab a bag of popcorn cough up $10+ and go see Marvel's new quirky superhero movie, you won't be mad."
"aesylvia","8","2","8","27 July 2015"," Takes the idea of a shrinking formula, and comedy, to new heights
","While I'm sure most people would have wanted Ant-Man, one of the founding Avengers in the comics, to have appeared on the big screen sooner, the creative team behind the film made it fit into the end of Phase 2 comfortably and gave us much to look forward to.<br/><br/>While it started out a tad slow for my taste, once it picked up speed, which didn't take long, I was never bored, and even during the slow beginning I had plenty to laugh about. Michael Pena added something unique in terms of humor that I had never seen before and he really stole every scene he appeared in (him whistling ""It's a Small World"" was so spot-on for this movie I could have kicked myself for not predicting it).<br/><br/>Pena wasn't the only comedian, everyone involved had great moments, and Scott's initial bumbling while learning how to use the suit and its power was hilarious. The way they used the Pym Particle technology also made for even more one-of-a-kind ways to invent laughs and they really want all-out in using every idea they could come up with, and executed it brilliantly.<br/><br/>The action scenes-let me tell you this is no small compliment (pun intended) that these scenes excited and dazzled me more than the bulk of Age of Ultron, and they managed to throw in a bunch more laughs during them too. The fight between Scott and Sam Wilson/Falcon was enormously satisfying and even provided a very nice connection for the end of the film and the post-credits scene.<br/><br/>The acting was all excellent, I found nothing to complain about and when Douglas got serious, it really got everyone's attention. Corey Stoll as the villain took a note out of Jeff Bridges' and Sam Rockwell's books from playing corporate villains in Iron Man 1 and 2 respectively, becoming a more sinister, more unhinged, and more confrontational antagonist even before putting on a suit, so it set this film apart from being just another Iron Man clone.<br/><br/>The heist angle is something I've never been particularly fond of but I think these guys found the winning formula injecting both science fiction and superheroes into it. The predictability of everything due to pre-planning was off-set by the amazing visuals and the impossible tasks that only the technology in a Marvel film could pull off.<br/><br/>A few questionable things like counting on chance to allow for certain events to transpire, some things that could have been fleshed out better, and the slow beginning prevented me from going to 9 out of 10 but if I could, I'd rate it an 8.5 rather than a flat 8. I highly recommend the 3D which lends itself to bringing the world from an ant's-eye view into full perspective.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're in the mood for a lot of laughs, some amazing action and some of the most inventive ideas put to sci-fi in quite a long time, this is something you won't want to pass up. Marvel is still going strong and just ups the ante on intrigue with each entry."

","ANT MAN: Scott Lang is a criminal and has been in prison for robbery but he wants to make his life better because of his daughter. Ones he is free he gets in touch with Dr. Hank Pym and he wants Scott to help him to protect the secret behind his Ant Man suit. Some dangerous people are behind it only to use it themselves. Hank Pym and Scott Lang must make a plan to defend the world.<br/><br/>I admit to , that I was not very excited for this film , not at all. But this is the kind of film you must first see before you judge. Peyton Reed did an excellent by creating how the world looks like when your small. Those scenes were filmed beautifully. Also I think he did an acceptable job on the script. Some people might disagree with it because they read the comics and now the original story, but he actually made it his own and he did a great job on that.<br/><br/>My opinion always was that Marvel Cinematic Universe did not gave much Female Superheroes, like d c Comic. So I was very glad with the character of Hope which is just an amazing character, maybe my favorite on MCU. Though I understand the pity of the die-heart fans who waited for the really Wasp. But on the other side it might be good sometimes to, as a filmmaker , make a movie your own. And that is what Peyton Reed did. What I didn't particularly like was the jokes – some were great like the train coming out of the house and the tank out of the building. But I didn't like the character of Luis at all he was rather annoying than funny.<br/><br/>Also it was good to see Agent Carter en Howard Stark in it, because than the story feels more a part of it. It was great seeing them. I give this film 8 out of 10."
"peterhill-84900","9","2","8","20 July 2015"," A Tale to Astonish indeed!
","A couple of years ago I would have scoffed at the idea of an Ant-Man movie. The name is pretty silly and to see someone shrink would have looked silly, especially in a cinematic movie with gods and super powered individuals. <br/><br/>But this movie kicked my ass! Every expectation was blown away and I had the time of my life. It's certainly a Marvel production and yet had it's own unique twist that made it stand out. Michael Douglas, Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily are fantastic as is the main villain. <br/><br/>The action is mind blowingly awesome as Ant-Man shifts from small to big when he takes on foes...and the final fight? Awesome. <br/><br/>There is however one fight scene that I did not see coming and was not shown in the trailers. <br/><br/>Falcon vs Ant-Man is by far my favorite moment in the entire movie! And Michael Pena may just be my favorite person in the entire cinematic movie...him and Anthony the ant ;)<br/><br/>One gripe is that the main villain Darren Cross seems a bit like Loki (trying to prove himself to someone close to him) and I wish Marvel wouldn't kill off villains all the time. Cross to me didn't have much time to grow. From the start he was always this angry millionaire who was a total jerk. <br/><br/>Overall it's a really fun movie. I don't usually see movies more than once except Guardians of the Galaxy, but I saw Ant-Man twice and I'm more than happy to see it again."
"bensonmum2","8","2","8","19 July 2015"," ""This is not some cute tech like the Iron Man suit!""
","I'll keep this short and sweet. Just got back from seeing Ant Man and what a blast! I don't know when the last time I enjoyed a movie this much in the theater. It's not perfect, but it's close. The final third is as action-packed and funny as any super hero movie I can remember seeing. The special effects were awesome. The scenes from Ant Man's shrunken point of view were a lot of fun. The cast was a hit with me. Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, and Evangeline Lilly all worked together very nicely. I wasn't familiar with Michael Peña but her literally steals every scene he's in. The story was a bit predicable, but more than adequate. It's a super hero movie, after all, so I wasn't expecting the second coming of Citizen Kane. Overall it's a great summertime popcorn movie. I'm already looking forward to seeing it again on video. And I'm even more excited about seeing Ant Man and The Wasp in future Marvel movies. An 8/10 from me."
"estebangonzalez10","8","2","8","19 July 2015"," Surprisingly fun and entertaining. Better than Age of Ultron
","""Imagine a soldier the size of an insect, the ultimate secret weapon.""<br/><br/>I wasn't too excited about this film considering the premise of a hero who can shrink to the size of an ant and telepathically communicate with them seemed a bit too far fetched even for a Marvel film. That and the fact that Edgar Wright decided to back down from the director's chair after a dispute with Disney; it looked as if everything was set out for failure. Despite not being a huge fan I've enjoyed all the Marvel films, but I have become increasingly weary of them as well. The Thor films and the first Captain America being my least favorites, I was sure this one was going to rank somewhere among them. I definitely wasn't expecting Ant-Man to be better than Age of Ultron, but I have to admit that the light tone worked here and this movie was much more entertaining. So, how did they pull it off? They got Peyton Reed to fill in for Wright as the director, and continued to build on Wright's screenplay. If Reed was able to make a film about High School cheerleaders entertaining, than this Ant- Man premise would be a piece of cake for him. By lowering the stakes, approaching the material with a lot of tongue in cheek humor, and aiming at being a crowd pleaser, Ant-Man ended up being a fun and entertaining film. I wouldn't go as far as saying this was as clever as Guardians of the Galaxy in its approach to humor and pop culture references, but it did come close. Perhaps it helped that I went in to it with very low expectations, but I walked out of the movie with a smile on my face. For once this felt like an origin story that worked on its own and didn't have to be a gigantic setup for the next Avengers films. The premise is silly and stupid at times, but the film is big on laughs.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons why Ant-Man worked so well was because of Paul Reed's lead performance as the titular character. Rudd delivers with his usual charm and perfect comedic timing. He embodies the character almost as well as Robert Downey Jr. does with Iron Man. With his smirky and cocky delivery, Downey Jr. makes Tony Stark more entertaining than when he's wearing the actual suit, and that felt very similar with Rudd here as Scott Lang. He plays a con-man who is trying to make an honest living, but finding it incredibly difficult due to his criminal record. He has a seven year old daughter, Claire (played by the adorable Abby Ryder Fortson), who he isn't allowed to visit until he can find stability and provide for her. Dr. Hank Pam (Michael Douglas) has kept a close eye on Scott and seems to have big plans for him. Hank has developed a special suit which allows him to shrink a man to the size of an ant and also increase his strength. Hank is too old for the suit now, but he believes Long is the ideal man for the job. He begins mentoring Scott, although his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) believes she should wear the suit. Ever since his wife died, Hank has had a terrible relationship with his daughter, but she has approached him after discovering that his former protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has developed a similar technology and wants to sell the formula to the wrong people. Scott's mission is to infiltrate Cross's building and destroy what he has been working on before it is too late. <br/><br/>Although it does follow a similar structure as most superhero films, Ant-Man feels at times more like a comedic heist movie. Of course due to the subject matter it also reminded me a lot of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (which also seems to be very fond of ants by the way). These elements gave the film a more breezy and light touch. Even in the final act of the film where the superhero movies tend to go big with a climactic battle scene, there are some great comedic moments involving a Thomas the train track and so forth, which continually downplay the film and lighten the mood. It is definitely a huge change of tone from Age of Ultron and The Winter Soldier, so it manages to stand out on its own as a superhero movie although it still shares some of its generic flaws. Despite the great visual effects during the shrinking scenes, there are still some structural elements that don't work as well. The family dynamic between Hope and her father and between Lang and his ex (played by Judy Greer) seem to be recycled and silly at times. Hank waits for too long in the film to explain what happened to his wife, which was more of a plot convenience than anything else. However, Paul Rudd's comedic performance elevate this film, as do the supporting cast. Michael Peña as Rudd's sidekick, stands out during his scenes (especially during his monologues) and he delivered some of the funniest moments of the film. Lilly also proved to be a strong female character, while Douglas is someone you can always bank on as a solid actor. Stoll wasn't a very menacing villain, and that seems to be a common flaw in most Marvel films, but considering the stakes were much lower here it wasn't that much of a letdown. Ant-Man was a pleasant surprise despite its silly premise and I'm actually looking forward to what Rudd can bring to the Marvel franchise. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"Pumpkin_Man","10","2","8","19 July 2015"," A Cheesy Good Blast That's Reminiscent of the Old School Comic Book Movies!!!
","Ant-Man is cheesy good fun in the best way possible. It almost feels like an old school 1980's comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (Like most DC comic movies nowadays) and has the right amount of comedy with crazy action. There are plenty of references to the other MCU films and even some surprise cameos. I would say this movie is equal to 'Guardians of the Galaxy' I loved the concept of a cat burglar wanting a chance of redemption by doing what's right and trying patch things up with his family. Paul Rudd seems like the best choice for Scott Lang. He doesn't seem like he'd be the superhero type because of his past, but by the end of the film, he proves that he's worthy to don the Ant-Man suit. This review WILL contain spoilers.<br/><br/>After being released from prison, Scott Lang swears off crime for good because he wants to do right by his daughter, but he can't hold a job because of his edgy past, so he's forced to pull off one more job by breaking into a house and finds the Ant-Man suit. Little does he know, the house he broke into was set up by Hank Pym, the scientist who created the technology of the Ant-Man suit. Hank thinks Scott is the perfect man for the job. He's to use the suit to break into a top secret building and steal the deadly Yellowjacket suit, which if used in the wrong way could cause major wars and destruction.<br/><br/>With the powers of the Ant-Man suit, Scott is able to shrink down to the size of an ant. He can control ants and other insects with his mind and help aid him in his mission. In conclusion, I thought this was a very decent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Filled with good action, good comedy, good storyline, and cool references. If you love comic book and superhero movies, I highly recommend ANT-MAN!!!"
"MrPorkuz","8","2","8","18 July 2015"," A new breed of Superhero
","Ant-Man is the newest movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which stars Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Corey Stoll and various other stars. <br/><br/>The movie revolves around Scott Lang a likable yet imperfect hero, as he is released from prison for burglary a crime him and his friends commit on a regular bases. This approach is very uncharacteristic to generic formulation of superheros however Lang's personality, relatability and relationship and drive to be a hero to his daughter is what makes the audience root for him through out the movie. <br/><br/>Eventually during the first half of the movie Ant-Man is born through the use of a revolutionary suit which can shrink the wear to the size of an ant while still providing the strength of a full sized human. If this technology where to get into wrong hands chaos who ensue to world which is why our villain Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) a corporate entrepreneur set on providing a breakthrough regarding shrinking technology exists . Darren Cross is by far the weakest part of the movie as all superhero movies need a good villain and Darren Cross just does not cut it. He is ruthless but with out reason at times and his backstory and reasoning behind his objectives are vague and generic. His character lacked character development which could have made him a more relatable character than a crazy psycho billionaire.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is not your typical blockbuster Marvel movie it is a lot slower paced which I enjoyed as it allowed for the film to develop a more comedic aspect which it harnesses in the movie very well thanks to Paul Rudd and Michael Pena. I honestly did not think I would have laughed as much in any Super-Hero movie but I had an enjoyable time. Although I did not watch the movie in 3D ,I would defiantly recommend watching it in 3D as much of the movie involves Ant-Man shrinking down. These scenes and the actions scenes look great and would probably look even better in 3D.<br/><br/>Overall Ant-Man was one of the most enjoyable movies of this Summer and I would definitely recommend seeing it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"utgard14","6","3","15","1 December 2015"," Fun but nothing special
","I'll admit I wasn't looking forward to this one. I was barely looking forward to it when Edgar Wright was attached, but after his very public break from the project I had zero expectations this would be anything but a trainwreck. I'm happy to say that it wasn't as bad as I feared. It actually isn't bad at all. A little ""meh"" perhaps but not bad. I enjoyed it for what it is, even if it's probably one of the last Marvel movies I'll be in any hurry to rewatch anytime soon. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are fine but do little to impress. Corey Stoll is a generic villain, forgettable in every way. Michael Peña and T.I. do a good job in their comedy relief roles. Anthony Mackie is fun as Falcon in his brief appearance. The best part of the movie, somewhat surprisingly, is Michael Douglas. I had doubts he would approach the part seriously, as a lot of actors from his generation look at comic book movies as an excuse to be campy. But he doesn't approach it that way and shines throughout the movie, easily overshadowing everyone else. I thought the scene where he was de-aged with special effects was nicely done. The effects were pretty good overall. The major negatives for the movie are that it never feels like it amounts to much and there are no memorable set pieces. There are so many ways to approach the character of Ant-Man, humorously and dramatically, that would have been more effective but also more risky. They chose to play it safe and I suppose I can't fault them for that. As it is, it's an enjoyable lightweight action comedy."

Being a die-hard Marvel fan (though I won't let that cloud my judgment of the film), I was mad at MCU for cutting Ant-man out of the original Avengers lineup, so I wasn't really expecting anything great about this. But lowering my expectations actually paid up. I'll admit, the plot was pretty formulaic and full of cinematic clichés, but thanks to director Reed's sleight of hand, the film didn't look boring. In fact it's ""fun"" factor can rival Guardian of the Galaxy's comedy. The performance of the cast was also a delight. Paul Rudd is a charming new addition to the ever-growing superhero roster of MCU, even though I still can't get over his height. The supporting cast was fine but I won't bother mentioning them. The real deal here is Mr. Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym. I really hope we get to see more of him in future Marvel films. Now the saving grace of the film is its CGI, visual effects, and action sequences: the ants and insect chase scenes, the Falcon fighting scene, the fight in the playground, everything! Thomas the Engine has never been so creepier. I recommend this film, whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan, follower of the MCU franchise, or just looking for an entertaining film. Go See it!"

Our lead Scott Lang is charming and likable. Dr. Hank Pym and his daughter Hope are quite compelling.

","Imagine if a female co-lead went through an entire Marvel movie without kissing the protagonist. Imagine a Marvel villain who has realistic motivation and a complex personality. Imagine a Marvel plot that is confident enough to refrain from utilizing humorous quips after every line of exposition. Okay, do you have that vision of a unique superhero movie in your head? Well, you might want to hold on to that idea and head to Marvel Studios with your pitch in the future because Ant-Man offers none of that. It is a little structurally different; instead of a non-stop explosive superhero vs. supervillain tale (a la Age of Ultron), it's actually a heist moviethe same way Captain America 2 is a ""spy movie,"" of course. That means that it's not exactly edgy or narratively revelatory; it's just a refreshing take for kids and families new to the genre.<br/><br/>Ant-Man centers around an adept thief, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has just been released from prison . After failing to reconcile with his family, he is again forced into another heist operation after discovering a miraculous suit that transforms one into an ant—the perfect capability for a man who's required to sneak through various tunnels and vents. I guess I'd have to thank Marvel this time on not giving us another abnormally muscular and chiseled hero. No, we get Paul Rudd, and you know how everyone has their man-crush even though they don't want to admit it? Well, Rudd is definitely mine. The guy is so charming, and thankfully, Marvel allows his quirky-toned sarcastic humor to truly shine from time to time here. He's the perfect man to play this goofball who ruins emotional moments between father and daughter and endlessly struggles to finally adapt to his superhuman abilities, and that's why he's one of the best characters/heroes in this universe alongside the guardians of the galaxy. Unfortunately, he somewhat gets lost in the shuffle as Michael Douglas brings his terrific acting chops along and Evangeline Lilly once again showcases her sheer badassery (the woman refuses to pick gender-humiliating roles).<br/><br/>At that point, Rudd is expected to just stick to his guns and play the typical action hero with the ultimate goal to save the world. The more I think about it though, the more I absolutely love the cast that was assembled for this film—probably Marvel's most intimate and lowest- budgeted production. We also get Michael Peña and rapper TI together, and they totally deliver when it comes to nicely-balanced comic relief (even though Peña is basically playing the Mexican stereotype). These two are not solely present for a couple of scenes. No, Peña is given ample screen-time to steal the screen whenever he's there, rambling on with his convoluted monologues that bounce from stories about one contact of his to another and on and on until we finally get to the point with a dumbfounded expression on our faces. It's certainly one of the film's most clever elements, which makes me wonder if it was due to Edgar Wright's prior involvement (before he unfortunately left the set for a new director, Peyton Reed, to step in—few films made me lose enthusiasm quite as fast as the day those news came out a year ago).<br/><br/>Now, I feel like I mention this every year, but Marvel simply doesn't understand the importance of introducing stakes into films and occasionally taking itself seriously in order to successfully convey the true danger of the situation. This movie, more than any other of theirs, commits this narrative crime. It continues to juxtapose action scenes between Ant-Man and his equally-sized rival with a wider shot that reveals just how silly this concept is. So, for example, Ant-Man's fighting on a train with the villain in what looks to be a cool action sequence. Cut to a further shot that reminds us this epic fight is really transpiring on a toy train, which lightly bumps into another object. At this point, Marvel is more focused on producing a light comedy that we can all laugh at than a legitimate action movie with a menacing villain and a hero who's fighting against the odds.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Douglas is given a lot of meat to work with in a role that I surely appreciated. He's a once-successful scientist who chose to shut his work and the company behind him only for the wrong person to take his place. His daughter, Hope (Lilly), continues to profess her desire to stop this corporation from leading down the wrong scientific path while also working there. She's the kind of female character that's understandably stubborn and ambitious at first only to hand over the reins to the leading man halfway into the movie. ""Okay, my work here is done. Time to let you save the worldand now I just really want to be with you even though we spent a lot of time competing with each other earlier in the film."" When we go back and consider Black Widow and Gamora in addition, we come to the epiphany that Marvel can't resist the temptation to create boring and useless female characters. Speaking of boring, phenomenal actor Corey Stoll plays this evil mastermind, Darren Cross, who plans to use these shrinking experiments/technologies for–of course– murderous means. It's yet another villainous role in this world that has nothing to offer beyond ""I'm evil just because!""<br/><br/>Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/ant-man-review/"

","I really enjoyed it! It's got action and a solid story without being to deep or serious! After all it is a comic book superhero movie about a hero who can shrink! I loved it and thought it was really well done. I liked the acting and the chemistry between them. I wasn't sure about Pym not being the Ant Man but loved how they worked the story and back story. I'm also not the biggest on humor in an action movie but found it to be well balanced and on point. It was also nice to see some Avengers in the movie! I will be seeing it again with some friends and usually I hate that but this one I can handle a second round of.

I give it an A-/B+."
"griffolyon12","9","2","9","19 July 2015"," Superbly Entertaining
","It almost seems like people are just waiting for Marvel Studios to stumble at this point. Well, those people will have to wait even longer cause Marvel has done it yet again with Ant-Man. Ant-Man is perhaps Marvel's most unique movie to date featuring a superhero who can become the size of an insect at will and use his special helmet to control ants with his thoughts, not to mention the fact that our hero, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), is an ex-con trying to go on the straight and narrow. <br/><br/>We first meet Scott as he is being released from prison for basically playing Robin Hood with a major corporation. Now vowing to go straight so that he can reconnect with his daughter, Cassie, Scott finds it harder than he initially thought to get a job thanks to his past, ultimately resorting to thievery yet again. Scott and his hilarious pals (led by a scene stealing Michael Pena) break into Dr. Hank Pym's house and crack open his safe to find what appears to be a weird motorcycle suit. Later, when Scott puts the suit on and shrinks, he realizes that this is no ordinary suit and that the man they stole from, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), is no ordinary man. One thing leads to another and Hank recruits Scott to help him and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lilly), save the world by stealing a dangerous piece of technology that Hank's former protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has developed, and thus, Ant-Man is born.<br/><br/>I really don't think there has ever been another superhero movie where the hero started out as someone who would ordinarily be the bad guy and by the end has become the ultimate good guy. That must have been a tough feat to pull off for the writers and director Peyton Reed, and yet they did it, they made Scott Lang such a likable guy that you are rooting for him the entire time (of course it doesn't hurt that the crimes he committed were ones of an altruistic/Robin Hood nature). However, the real x-factor in regards to Scott Lang is Paul Rudd. Rudd infuses his natural everyman vibe with his charm and goofiness, making Lang a character we care for in regards to achieving his goal of overcoming his past to be closer to his daughter. In a nutshell, that idea of either overcoming or succumbing to your past is the thematic spine of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Scott wants to actually earn the look in his daughter's eyes by being a better man than he was in the past, while Hank Pym is trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter and come to terms with what happened with his wife's death, and Hope and Darren are both trying to wrestle with their complicated feelings toward Hank's treatment of them growing up. Ultimately, with Scott, Hank, and Hope, being the good guys, and Darren being the bad guy, you know who overcomes their past and who doesn't, but the fact that a superhero movie features such ideas as redemption and atonement as well as the dangers of hate, is a great added bonus. When it's all said and done though, the main reason I absolutely love Ant-Man is because it's just so much fun.<br/><br/>This movie is chock full of jokes and even in the dramatic moments there is humor to keep things from ever getting too stuffy. Few movies nowadays are brave enough to just be silly and have a good time, and that's what Ant-Man does. You can tell the filmmakers know that this whole concept is absurd and they don't care. The characters take their situations seriously and believe in what they're doing, but they also make jokes at almost every turn because that's just who these characters are and that is, in my opinion, the mark of every Marvel Studios movie thus far and why I like what they're doing more than DC. So if you just wanna have fun at the movies, go see Ant-Man, cause I can guarantee you wont regret it.<br/><br/>P.S., the musical score by Christophe Beck is sick!!!<br/><br/>I give Ant-Man a 9 out of 10!"
"Shad_Critic","7","2","9","17 July 2015"," Awesome And Funny
","It's very refreshing seeing a non-sequel Marvel movie. I loved Ant Man very much. The first 20 minutes was kinda boring but it gets interesting after those 20 minutes. The humor in this one is great. The story is pretty much good. <br/><br/>But there are still flaws. First flaw is the villain, Darren Cross or Yellowjacket. He almost has no motivation as a villain. His background story wasn't enough, making his character underdeveloped. Second Flaw is, we only get to see Hank Pym as Ant Man on a very short footage. If there would be an Ant Man prequel and we'll see Hank Pym as Ant Man, I'd love to see it. But even with these flaws, it's still a lovable Marvel movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Ant Man is awesome! Great humor and great story. It was a good treat."
"drawlife","7","2","9","17 July 2015"," A decent twelfth entry for the MCU.
","Ant-Man, another gamble for Marvel Studios and in a long time coming. The film doesn't hit an immediate home run, but thankfully makes it to home base and it's not afraid to poke fun at itself. Ant-Man is quite different compared to the other MCU films, it obviously has some similar origin story beats, but it works due to the fact that we haven't seen super powers or ants like this before. <br/><br/>But lets get into some of the problems I had with the film. The tone was consistent, but at times I don't think the film really knew what it wanted to be. The starts off very rocky in the beginning. It tires to set things up too eagerly, you don't have time to embrace it, there wasn't much subtlety to it and a lot of the times it feels forced. It eventually picks up steam, but it can be a drag to sit through and is arguably the film's dullest spot. When Ant-Man tries to hit on the heavier notes, there are some moments where it works, but also at times it feels forced when it's trying to be sincere, it's sort of a mix bag, there are plenty good, but it comes with some slightly above average qualities. <br/><br/>Like all Marvel villains, with the exception of Loki, Winter Soldier, and Ultron, the villain is so weak and treated almost like fodder. Poor Corey Stoll. I like him, he's a good character actor. I would have loved more backstory on Darren Cross, I can get by his issues with Hank Pym, played by the great Michael Douglas, but it's not really all fleshed out. It's very two- dimensional so to speak. Marvel really needs to improve this aspect of their movies. It's becoming more and more annoying the deeper we go into this cinematic universe, we are twelve movies in and only three villains of those twelve movies are decent at best. I really hope Thanos is done right after all this build up. Anyways, Stoll's action sequences and his Yellowjacket suit is killer though. It's more materialistic and more advance than the Ant-Man suit and provides eye candy. <br/><br/>Speaking of Michael Douglas, his role as Hank Pym is very smooth. He does provide a lot of exposition, but his presence in the film just elevates every scene he's in, also being apart of SHIELD for sometime was quite interesting(with a surprise cameo from two MCU veterans). I felt a good chemistry between his character and his daughter Hope Van Dyne played by Evangeline Lilly more so than I did with Rudd and his daughter. Lilly holds her own on screen and isn't a typical damsel in distress, in fact she is the opposite and kicks butt with an attitude. I liked the parallel of the relationship between fathers and daughters within the film, which is what the film operates under. <br/><br/>Speaking of that, lets get to Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, he carries this film quite well. He isn't just an everyman per say, but a burglar who tries to do right for his daughter, and we kinda haven't seen that at all. He's likable and fun to watch, and the foundation of this film's success is his spot on performance. Credit for the out of the box casting choice. Normally I dislike child actors, no disrespect, but here his relationship with his daughter Cassie played by Abby Ryder Fortson was tolerable. Rudd has some quippy lines and fun moments, but his sidekicks, mainly Michael Pena's Luis has the funniest moments on the film. T.I. and David Dastmalchian also provide nice supporting roles. I will point out that at times, for me there was just too much comedy, and it made me a little less invested from time to time when things mattered. Bobby Cannavale has a small role, who sort of in a way does not end up being the character I thought he'd end up being which was a nice surprise. <br/><br/>The shrinking and expanding element brings a whole different dimension within the action films. It brings something new to see on the big screen and it's quite a joy to watch. Just the use of microphotography and first rate special effects are stellar. Very innovative action, clever, and adventurous. You'll have to see it for yourself to comprehend what I mean, the trailers only give you a taste. <br/><br/>With all the drama that took place, Payton Reed does a good job taking over the director's chair over Edgar Wright. Obviously there will be people who would wonder what Wright could have done, one can't help it but think that, but the film shouldn't be judged under those merits. In the end Reed does a commendable job at selling a far-fetched superhero, and making it work overall. Not to mention this film doesn't go into the Iron Man 2 territory, it's a nice blend of references without denting the main narrative. We do get a nice cameo from Anthony Mackie's Falcon which is great(not a spoiler, shown in the TV spots). <br/><br/>I'd like the mention that you'd be surprise that the ants in the film are not just drones or used for set pieces, they actually have some cool moments and kinda have characteristics. I've never been more intrigued by ants after seeing this film. You'll leave the theater thinking just how cool the ants are. <br/><br/>As for the end credits scene, they are very solid. It ties in very well into the future of the MCU perfectly. Bring on Civil War. <br/><br/>7/10"
"Eliott-Smith","7","2","9","16 July 2015"," Great addition to the Marvel Universe!
","Ant man is a fun family friendly film, great character development, kinda good chemistry, and awesome action sequences, but the most hilarious thing about this film is the fact that supporting characters are funnier then Ant Man himself. Peyton Reed delivered well being his first Marvel film, some comedic moments kinda ruin emotional moments that you get attached too, but hey this is Marvel after all. Russell Carpenter did an amazing job with the cinematography it was extremely on point! After credit scenes we're awesome! and totally worth it unlike Guardians of Galaxy or Iron Man 3 ones.<br/><br/>Solid 7/10 Reason is because Yellowjacket should not have been killed off, he would've fitted in well with Civil War, I think they kinda wasted his character, its happened three times now, Amazing spider man 2 Age of Ultron and now Antman, Marvel and Sony is in the habit of killing villains of they don't necessarily need too, anyway just my opinion."
"truemythmedia","4","1","3","10 July 2018"," Edgar Wright's Loss is Keenly Felt
","The film just seems so tone deaf. Losing Edgar Wright off the film was a huge blow and a great example of why cinephiles follow directors and writers more than actors. Paul Rudd is a funny guy and a decent lead but when he isn't being written for and directed by a person with as much talent as him, he's just stuck in a middle-ing movie, delivering middle-ing lines.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Ant Man"" seems more like the sort of film Edgar Wright would normally make fun of, not write."

","I'm not a big fan of super hero movies, but this time i made an exception and i wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Honestly, its this is one of the better Marvel movies, it has surpassed my expectations, thought it was going to be cliché like the rest of them, but it was much much different. Just because he doesn't rush into explosive battles at the start of the film, they added a lot of backstory to this character, and its not just some ""freak accident"". I think Marvel picked the right actor to be Ant-Man, they both have similar characteristics. Just the concept of shrinking somebody to the size of an ant and smaller is quite amazing.<br/><br/>Its comedic, action packed and child friendly as per usual. I found myself enjoying this film and laughing quite a bit.<br/><br/>Its definitely worth a watch."

","A man who fell to the depth of misery crawls up to a tiny but big hero ant-man. The story line and concept is quite interesting. But I have one question that why Scott is chosen as the ant man. In the hours, the reason is unnatural and unconvincing. <br/><br/>The description of the small world is funny for real. Mixing real world and small world, the constant change keeps interest. Especially I like the scene that Scott wears the suit in a bath room for the first time. In the viewpoint from ants, we can directly realize the fear of water. In fact, the expectation was not high before watching this movie, so I feel it surprisingly interesting."
"brando647","8","1","3","18 June 2016"," Paul Rudd's Ant-Man is a Welcome Addition to the MCU
","Marvel Studios loves to flaunt their skills. They made comic book/superhero movies a cultural juggernaut, nailed the idea of a shared cinematic universe, and proved that even their strangest properties can have a home on the big screen where audiences will embrace them. If GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY didn't prove that Marvel can pretty much do whatever they want, ANT-MAN does. ANT-MAN was probably their highest risk venture since the original IRON MAN; a wealth of behind-the-scenes struggles gave the impression that the movie might never see the light of day and left some of us wondering if whatever was left would taint Marvel's amazing track record. Well, ANT-MAN has come and gone and, no surprise, Marvel nailed it. Our hero in ANT-MAN is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a cat burglar freshly released from prison who hopes to turn his life around so he can spend more time with his young daughter. Society proves hesitant to forgive a feloneven when his crime was punishing a corporation for ripping off its customersand Scott starts to wonder if a life of crime might be his only option after all. Rumors of an easy score lead Scott to break into the home of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a genius inventor with former ties to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the discovery of the fabled Ant-Man suit. Of course, Pym was the one who started the rumor to test Scott's thieving skills because he needs the ex- con's help. One of Pym's former apprentice's, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has nearly cracked Pym's technique for shrinking matter by lessening the space between atoms and he intends on selling this incredibly dangerous tech to the highest bidder. Pym needs Scott to become Ant-Man and use the incredible shrinking ability to pull off his most incredible heist yet, saving the world.<br/><br/>ANT-MAN, from director Peyton Reed and a handful of screenwriters, is so much better than it had any right to be. I was admittedly bummed when Edgar Wright left the project, citing creative differences, because I was excited to see what such a uniquely creative force would bring to the project. I understand some of Wright's contributions survived to the final product and I couldn't tell you who contributed what, but I really like the end result. ANT-MAN continues a trend that'd been developing within Marvel's second ""phase"" of movies where they experiment with the idea of creating superhero movies outside of the usual ""good-guy-punching-bad-guy"" genre. ANT-MAN is a heist film that just so happens to utilize a superhero that can shrink and communicate with ants. And it's just as much a comedy as an action film. Ant-Man's first big screen outing could've easily just aped IRON MAN and followed a familiar route but instead they took some risks that paid off in one of the more fun recent Marvel movies. Perhaps taking a cue from Chris Pratt's casting as Star Lord, comedian Paul Rudd was cast as the shrinking hero and he knocks it out of the park. His charisma and sense of humor make him a perfect hero, and he's got great chemistry with little Abby Ryder Fortson who plays his daughter Cassie. Moment of honesty: I get a little choked in the big (small?) final battle when Cassie is in danger, Scott Lang arrives on the scene and pops his faceplate up with a ""Hi, peanut!"", and Cassie just smiles broadly, forgetting for a moment she's being held captive by a super-villain. I can't not (yes, double negative) feel for the guy and, because he's Paul Rudd, he's just inhumanly likable. The character of Scott Lang, as played by Rudd, is a welcome addition to the Marvel franchise.<br/><br/>I also can't get over how strange it is to see legendary Michael Douglas acting in a Marvel film. And he's not some throwaway side character like Glenn Close in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY; he's Hank Pym! And he's not phoning it in either so, you know, extra bonus. He's having some fun here. I'm not sure the same can be said for Evangeline Lilly as Pym's daughter Hope van Dyne. She's cold and humorless for most of the film and doesn't start to warm up until we're nearing the big heist, so it makes it a little difficult to cheer for the inevitable hookup with Scott that the movie telegraphs from miles away. Coming out the worst is poor Yellowjacket/Darren Cross. Marvel's notorious for having trouble putting out three-dimensional villains in the films and Cross is one of the worst examples. He's motivated by anger toward Pym for not letting him in on the world of Ant-Man and I guess he's also going sort of crazy from shrink-related malpractice. He'll never stand up along the likes of Loki (has anyone?) but we do get a super-fun battle between the tiny hero and villain in a child's train set. Speaking of the shrinking, the visual effects in this movie are fantastic. I love the shrinking/enlarging effects and the ant design, and every time we get to explore the world from a micro-level is a blast. So congratulations to Marvel for this one. ANT- MAN went from my biggest concern to one of my more anticipated franchises. This movie teases fun directions for future films and I'm excited for any chance we'll get to revisit Ant-Man's unique perspective. Just keep the light-hearted sense of fun and humor and I'm sure this series will continue to stand out in an ever-growing sea of superheroes."
"Blazehgehg","8","1","3","17 April 2016"," Sharply written and more of a comedy than anything else
","If there's one thing that Marvel has been really good about with their ""cinematic universe,"" it's that they don't pigeon-hole any of their characters in to a specific genre. Super Heroes come in all shapes, sizes, and colors, and Marvel gives their movies enough room to be more than just costumed crusaders punching each other.<br/><br/>Such is the case with Ant-man, a movie that knows how ridiculous its concept sounds, and plays with that in fun, funny ways. It kind of reminds me of the original Iron Man movie in a way, as it sort of comes out of nowhere to blindside you with an undeniable charm and a sense of humor you weren't really expecting.<br/><br/>And, unlike most other super hero movies, this one doesn't concern itself with ""the fate of the world"" or even the fate of a city. Perhaps more than any of Marvel's other movies, this movie keeps its feet surprisingly grounded in normal human drama. Sure, yes, okay, there's technically a villain who is gearing up to do something big and villainous, but that almost takes a back seat to a deadbeat dad trying to get control back of his life.<br/><br/>And that, I think, is the secret to Ant-man's success, and Marvel's success with these movies as a whole: they aren't ABOUT the super heroes, they're about the people inside the costume, and what really matters to them when they aren't saving the world. Ant-man makes that clearer than ever before."
"BillSims28","7","1","3","13 March 2016"," Five-Word Review: Breezy, Funny, Exciting, Good Fun
","If the idea of Edgar Wright helming a Marvel film didn't excite you, then you need to go and see some Edgar Wright films. Therefore the news that he wasn't directing the MCU's 12th film came as something of a disappointment. However, with Wright replaced by Peyton Reed (Yes Man), comedy superstar Paul Rudd (This is 40) as the lead, and a solid supporting cast including Michael Douglas (Wall Street), Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit) and Corey Stoll (House of Cards), it would've been hard for Ant-Man to fail, even if it is about the hero who is one of Marvel's most derided in the modern age.<br/><br/>After the city-destroying, world-threatening relentless onslaught of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man makes the wise decision of downsizing its scale - smaller hero, smaller stakes - as this is, for the most part, a heist movie. Hank Pym (Douglas), who created the Ant-Man in the 1980s, begins to worry when an unstable and ambitious worker (Stoll) at his company develops 'The Yellowjacket', a variation of Pym's suit, which could be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Enter ex-prisoner Scott Lang (Rudd). Blocked by his ex-wife (Judy Greer) and her obnoxious new husband (Bobby Cannavale) from seeing his young daughter, the master thief is recruited to help Pym and his own daughter (Lilly) steal The Yellowjacket, with a crew made up of Michael Peña (The Martian), David Dastmalchian (the snake guy from Prisoners) and rapper TI. This fast-moving plot allows for an easygoing, pretty light-hearted tone, evoking feelings of MCU's best film, Guardians of the Galaxy. Characters are funny without being unrealistic quippers like in Age of Ultron, the script (with a clear Wright influence) zips along with style, and leaves room for heartfelt father-daughter substance between Pym and Lang and their respective daughters. There are also some great references to other Marvel films and products, with a great Civil War setup, and the two scenes where Peña's character tells an elaborate, multi-character story are as funny as anything in any comedy of 2015, along with some other genuinely funny humour (including the best use of Thomas the Tank Engine outside of the Island of Sodor ever). Ant-Man himself is a surprisingly cool hero, with exciting, superbly edited action that ISN'T mind-numbing. Shrinking and growing with ease, he proves a worthy foe for all enemies, and it will be interesting to see how he fits in among the likes of Iron Man, Captain America and Hawkeye in the upcoming Civil War.<br/><br/>Ant-Man has few pitfalls beyond the regular Marvel ones: it's obviously quite formulaic and often mindless, and the villain is still pretty forgettable. At least they addressed the problem of Marvel films ending in an destroyed city - yet this ending seems very similar to that of 2008's Iron Man. Overall though, a solid, entertaining romp, a good Civil War setup, and a better way to end Phase 2 than the endless teasing of Age of Ultron. Pretty good, witty, entertaining fun. 78/100"

Of course, with a history such as Ant-Man's (with Wright leaving the production merely months before filming and multiple script re- writes), I was personally among the majority who were worried about the outcome of this movie.<br/><br/>When the first trailer dropped, it did nothing to quell my worries. If anything, it seemed to make a good case as to why Marvel shouldn't make origin stories anymore. Quite honestly, when the second trailer dropped, it shocked me with the wit, tone, and surprisingly well-developed action sequences.<br/><br/>From that moment on, I was fully on board the Ant-Man train, and it became one of my most highly anticipated movies of the year (apart from a little space-oriented indie coming out in December). And I will tell you now, I was not disappointed. This movie delivered on nearly every level, boasting top-notch performances by Michael Peña, Corey Stoll, Evangeline Lilly, and of course Paul-goddamn- Rudd. Ladies and gentleman, Marvel continues to utilise their Midas touch.<br/><br/>Following the constant high-stakes, end of the world scenarios present in nearly every MCU movie of the last five years, Ant-Man is a breath of fresh air, presenting a more contained, smaller-scale (pun intended) aspect to the behemoth franchise. A heist movie at heart, Ant-Man manages to fit in perfectly with other Marvel films while not overflowing the film with Avengers references (Iron Man 2, anyone?). Paul Rudd is a welcome addition to the MCU, his likability and performance alone making this movie possibly one of the best standalone Marvel films since Favreau's Iron Man."

","Once again, there's a guy who needs to take over the world and side with a horrible group. He has money and fame and yet he has to go over to the dark side. In this case, he has taken previous research and molded it to his own devices. Michael Douglas first developed the ability to close up molecules and make things turn smaller with intense strength and capabilities. Then he loses his wife and drops from the scene. His right hand man, an ambitious jerk moves ahead and plots evil use of the findings. Paul Rudd plays a poor guy who is divorced. He was sent to prison for a burglary which had some unfair circumstances that led to unfair results. Pyn, Michael Douglas's character, realizes that he has to stop the next step or these bad guys will take over the world and brutalize it. Rudd becomes Ant-Man, not just because he can become small, but because he learns to run with the ants. Of course, the whole thing is high on the hokeyness meter, but, then, it is comic book stuff. It is fun and exciting and works pretty well. It leads to some pretty sappy results, but this is not Fellini or Bergman. It's a joyful effort, using the Marvel trademark."

","Directed by Peyton Reed, Ant-Man is an origin story about Scott Lang (Paul Rudd); a reformed ex-convict who is trying to put his old ways behind him to become a part of his daughter's life once more. Struggling to find work, he reluctantly crosses paths with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a scientific genius who has invented a revolutionary suit. Granting the wearer the ability to shrink to the size of an ant, it also makes them 50 times stronger.<br/><br/>Training alongside Pym's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), it takes Scott some time to master the suit, leading to some comical mishaps. What follows is essentially a heist movie, proving once more that Marvel can explore different genres while maintaining a cohesive universe.<br/><br/>Shrinking audiences down to a whole new level opens up a new playground of creative opportunities; one that hasn't been properly exploited since Honey I Shrunk The Kids. It'll also add a new dimension to future Avengers films, as everyone will seem like giants in comparison.<br/><br/>Ant-Man lacks an emotional punch of the likes of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, with the tone being kept lighthearted throughout. It also felt like Yellow Jacket; the villain of the piece, could have been given more to do before the inevitable final showdown.<br/><br/>Audiences are advised to wait until the end of the credits, for some of the best bonus scenes yet.<br/><br/>Marvel has successfully established another exciting character into their growing cinematic universe. Rudd is a charismatic and likable lead, with Douglas and Lilly in great supporting roles. Antastic fun!"

","The film is stupid and rather insulting. Don't worry I am not one of those losers who watches Marvel films with their endless sequels and crappy universe films. This came on TV and I watched it (with bathroom breaks during the commercials).
There is a giant ant that has morphed inside the house and runs out past the local pigs. The cop looks at it and says ""that's a messed up looking dog.""<br/><br/>Yup.

","I just read (most of) an unflattering review of the film that seemed a bit longer than the script itself! The author went on and on, ripping apart every aspect of the film, as if his life depended on it, mewling about the film's dialog, it's ""pathos"", it's sub-text, etc...Dude - it's a comic book SUPER-HERO movie! What were you expecting - Shakespeare In The Park? So, having said that, are there better super-hero flicks? Sure, but let's face it - Ant Man is a minor character for a reason - how is he supposed to compete with Norse Gods and less-than-jolly green giants? Anyway, bottom line, from where I sat the actors and characters were enjoyable, if not believable. The plot (Yes, as predictable as it was) kept me guessing enough be entertained, the action sequences, while not mind-blowing, were satisfying, and with a dash of light-hearted humor, it all worked well for me! Would I see it again? Maybe not at full price, but I'm glad I did see it this time! Now, if you'll excuse me I'm headed over to Shakespeare In The Parking Lot - gotta grab me a bucket o'deep-fried pathos!"
"bombadil-esquire","9","2","10","23 August 2015"," Opposite of a complaint
","Given that this movie is directly in a lineup that started from the Incredible Hulk, being a lineup of fine action movies, the *only* reason to complain about a lack of action is if you haven't seen them, or aren't having the broad MCU storyline in mind. That is to say, Ant-man can be considered as a ""break"" from the MCU films that have specifically lots of action, namely every MCU installment except for Iron Man 2. It doesn't fail to be funny, particularly with the character Luis, and even succeeds in slipping one Avenger appearance in there (which turns out to be a funny encounter between him and the main character) to make fans happy. This film lacks ""missed opportunities"" , and the movie-makers did a good job of doing something so small as having there be a Hydra-buyer present in Cross' company towards the end - a simple allusion to the bigger antagonist-sphere of the MCU. (that is, Hydra)<br/><br/>It doesn't have the thrill that exists in both Avengers movies, but that isn't a disadvantage - that's made up for in the fact that this hero (Ant-man) is particularly unique. That's what this movie offers, a new to-be-Avenger-hero who turns super teeny tiny, just joining the lineup. No reason to find it a disappointment, if an Ant-man is what you wanted."
"templar77099","7","2","10","26 July 2015"," What a thrill
","Well, I'm surprised. I didn't have great expectation for this one, but Oh My Bloody God it was so good! I always knew the character, but I never cared that much. With that in mind, I never thought the movie could be so amusing and enjoyable. Just Like Guardians, this one is a funny departure from the ""regular"" Marvel movies. And this is the kind of superhero movie I think Marvel could do more, because, for serious comic movie adaptations we already have DC. <br/><br/>Firstly, there is Paul Rudd. When I knew he was casted as Scott Lang, and Edgar Wright was still on the helm of the project, I thought, this is going to be a all out comedy. On the other hand, I didn't thought Rudd could pull of the action stunts. But then he got ripped and tough and everything seemed possible. But then Wright left and I feared for the film. Well, despite not knowing how much of Wright is in the theatrical product, I believe that Peyton Reed did a great job.<br/><br/>Rudd is amazing, with a perfect comic timing and excellent improvisation skills. He is a great comedian. Besides, he has the acting chops and he surely can punch a guy. Then we have Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man. He was as great as Rudd and I never thought he could do comedy so well. Evangeline Lilly also surprised me with the comic skills. She is a very fine actress and I hope we see more of her in the next years. Then we have Corey Stoll as the villain, Darren Cross. He was good, but I think that sometimes he was almost crossing the thin line between acting and over-acting. <br/><br/>But the real blast is Michael Peña as Scott's hispaniard friend, Luis. He is excellent, the best part of the movie for me!He just steals every scene he is in. He has been really hot these past years and he deserves it, he is a great actor and a even better comedian. <br/><br/>The only problem I had with is had to do with the framing. I don't know if it was a problem with the cinema screen I saw it in or if it was a creative statement but most of the time the character's head ended up being cut from frame. <br/><br/>In the end, Ant-Man is my favourite Marvel movie after Guardians of the Galaxy. It's such enjoyable and a blast to see.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, watch it."
"samigrod","8","2","10","23 July 2015"," Don't count this superhero out
","Marvel has proved yet again that they can take any one of their superheroes, turn it into a movie, and money will instantly start pouring into their pockets. Ant Man starring Paul Rudd is about Scott Lang who is a thief and has just been released from prison as he attempts to reenter into his daughter's life. He soon teams up with Hank Pym, played by Michael Douglas, to stop the fate of the world and to do so he needs to get even with his former apprentice by being the smaller man, literally. <br/><br/>Ant Man is the second marvel movie to come out this year following Avengers: Age of Ultron which many people liked but others felt underwhelmed by. I can say that Ant Man is a lot of fun and definitely worth checking out if Age of Ultron was disappointing to you. The jokes in this movie definitely will have you cracking up with Paul Rudd and crew's silly and charming banter, however; I do feel Paul Rudd's character should have been more of an oddball protagonist since he's a comedic actor. Something the lines of Chris Pratt's Peter Quill from Guardians of the Galaxy would have made Ant Man feel more distinct from previous Marvel films. The movie also credits Edgar Wright for the story which made me wonder what the movie could have been like had he continued with the project. Again, the movie could have used some more unique flare to distance itself from other Marvel films and I feel Edgar Wright could have helped in that department. <br/><br/>Another plus is the CGI in this film is top notch minus a few random objects in the background. The ants all looked extremely real with extreme detail. Marvel's production value just keeps getting better and better with every film. Probably the only real problem with Ant Man is its villain. His transformation felt forced and was just a boring character. He had a flat, one sided personality with very weak motivation for his ultimate goal so after he was beaten the victory seemed less rewarding. <br/><br/>After everything, Ant Man is full of fun and a very well executed superhero movie. Aside from its few faults if you're a superhero fan this is one to check out."
"bryank-04844","6","2","10","21 July 2015"," Where does 'Ant-Man' stand in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Find Out Here!!
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues this summer of 2015 with 'Ant-Man', which is a lesser known character and storyline than the usual big Avenger characters. This is a film that i've looked forward to for a few years now, because the story of 'Ant-Man' and his abilities are very cool. When I had my comic book store, I actually had the first five issues of 'Ant-Man' ever. I really dug those comics. Imagine how excited I was when news broke that director Edgar Wright signed on to write and direct the film.<br/><br/>Wright is the brilliant man who brought us 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Hot Fuzz', 'The World's End', and 'Scott Pilgrim vs The World'. With those movies alone, you can only imagine what Edgar Wright could do in the Marvel Universe. However, it was never meant to be. Wright and the executives over at Marvel did not see eye to eye, so Wright left the project after working on it for three years. Marvel does a lot of good things and makes correct decisions most of the time in regards to their characters and stories on film. This is not one of those times. Instead, we got a director named Peyton Reed, who is the guy who brought us the cheerleading movie 'Bring It On' amongst other flops.<br/><br/>This is a different film for the comic book company. Marvel bet big on 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which was not their routine story and set up, like we've seen in the past, but it ending paying off in a big way both critically and financially. With 'Ant- Man' they have a comedic actor, who really hasn't done anything in the form of action, take on the Marvel Universe and will be a part of the 'Avengers'. Again, this is a big bet for Marvel if they can stray from their usual storyboards. With the exit from Edgar Wright, it didn't look like a good bet.<br/><br/>In an effort not to push back the release date of 'Ant-Man', Marvel hired Peyton very quickly, and after viewing the film, it became evident that almost everything was rushed. That being said, 'Ant-Man' is for sure a heck of a lot of fun and will sure make enough money for Marvel to bathe in and provide the already announced sequels. But that's about it. It's just a fun movie. Nothing more. Nothing less. 'Ant- Man' rushes from scene to scene and from montage to montage, leaving us out of any real character development from our heroes and villains. It just isn't really there.<br/><br/>Yes, we get the backgrounds of everyone and some resemblance of a relationship between a few people, but it's all settled with a line of cheesy dialogue with no real emotion. As I continued to watch each scene, I could only think and say to myself, ""Edgar Wright would have done such a better job here."" Unfortunately, that's the way it is, folks. Paul Rudd is fantastic as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. I mean, how can you not like Rudd's genuine and unique comedic timing and charm, and that's where this movie succeeds most. Michael Douglas sure hasn't lost a step either, playing Hank Pym.<br/><br/>He owns the role. Corey Stoll plays the villain of the film and while he is an excellent actor, the role and dialogue for him is so over-the-top and cliché, that you can't help but roll your eyes. Then there is Evangeline Lilly, who plays Pym's daughter Hope Van Dyne. She does an excellent job in her role, but again, the clichés are there and comes across as more as a character we've seen many times before.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of the film are not with any of the superhero action, but with Scott Lang's criminal trio of friends, played by Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and T.I. Every time they are on film, I laughed till I hurt. They were fantastic. Unfortunately, they don't have much screen time. There are very small moments here and there where you can see Wright's hand prints, but they don't come along very often. Of course, you'll want to stay through the entire credit sequence as there are two extra scenes to get you excited for future films. That all being said, 'Ant- Man' is still fun, but doesn't hold a candle to any of the previous Marvel films we have grown to love."
"zardoz-13","10","2","10","21 July 2015"," Antastic!
","The Marvel Comics Universe keeps getting bigger and more spectacular with each appearance of ""The Avengers,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" ""The Fantastic Four,"" ""X-Men,"" ""Wolverine,"" and ""The Guardians of the Galaxy."" Consequently, it comes with a sigh of relief that the latest newcomer, ""Ant-Man"" (**** OUT OF ****), shrinks from such apocalyptic pretensions. ""Bring It On"" director Peyton Reed, who replaced British writer & director Edgar Wright, has helmed what could possibly be the most imaginative as well as the atypical superhero saga of the summer. Miniaturization is the cornerstone of this clever little yarn. Mind you, nobody can completely appreciate ""Ant-Man"" who hasn't seen director Jack Arnold's seminal science-fiction feature ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957) where an unfortunate fellow--through no fault of his own--found himself reduced to the size of a toothpick and tangled with predatory house cats while taking refuge in a child's doll house. Similarly, the next major movie to magnify shrinkage, director Richard Fleischer's ""Fantastic Voyage"" (1966), scaled down scientists to microscopic dimensions and injected them into a comatose scientist's bloodstream to save him from a lethal blood clot. Appropriately, television capitalized on all things minuscule with Irwin Allen's ""Land of the Giants"" (1968-1970) where the crew and passengers of the Spindrift, a commercial sub-orbital transport spaceship, traveled into treacherous outer space turbulence and then crashed on an unknown planet. Everything loomed twelve times larger on this peculiar planet than anything on Earth making for 51 exciting episodes. Of course, other honorable mentions include the Dennis Quaid comedy ""Innerspace"" (1987) and the Rick Moranis farce ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989).<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" opens in 1989. Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) hands Howard Stark (John Slattery of ""Iron Man 2"") his resignation and leaves the espionage, law-enforcement, and counterterrorism agency SHIELD. Naturally, Stark regrets Pym's departure. Pym exits because SHIELD went behind his back and endeavored to duplicate the Pym Particle with his Ant-Man shrinking-suit technology. Pym lost his wife while during his experiments with that technology, and he deems it is far too dangerous for anybody to trifle with. ""As long as I am alive,"" proclaims Pym, ""nobody is ever going to get that formula."" This early scene fascinates because the filmmakers have given actor Michael Douglas an incredible, computerized, makeover so he appears twenty years or younger. For the record, Hollywood has altered some of the Marvel Comics canon. In the comics, Pym—not Tony Stark and Bruce Banner—originally created the villainous Ultron, who menaced our heroic quintet in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron."" Meanwhile, the years have not kind to Pym. After he exited SHIELD, he formed his own company, Pym Technologies. Sadly, Pym's evil protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll of ""The Bourne Legacy""), has seized control and feverishly schemes to replicate the prized Pym Particle. Ironically enough, Hank's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly of ""Lost""), appears to be working in league with the treacherous Cross.<br/><br/>Meantime, idealistic thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) leaves San Quentin after serving a three-year stretch for burglary. Actually, Scott qualifies as the most sympathetic ex-con in cinematic history. Since he divorced his wife Maggie (Judy Greer of ""Jurassic World"") but hasn't paid a penny of child support, Scott cannot visit his adorable daughter, Cassie (newcomer Abby Ryder Fortson), who misses him as much as he misses her. Not only does Maggie stonewall Scott, so does her smarmy fiancé, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale of ""Spy""), who happens to be a cop. Reluctantly, Scott boards with his former cellmate, Luis (a scene-stealing Michael Peña of ""Fury""), who lures him back into a life of crime. Scott struggled to go straight, even landed a job at Baskin-Robbins, but his boss learned about this prison record and fired him. Desperate to make child support money, Scott resorts to his burglary skills. He breaks into none other than Hank Pym's house and steals an exotic helmet and suit. Later, he discovers the outfit enables him to shrink to ant size and enhance his fighting prowess. ""Second chances don't come around all that often,"" Pym warns Scott. ""This is your chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are."" Scott joins Hank in an outlandish plan to prevent the megalomaniacal Cross from selling the Pym Particle to SHIELD's nemesis HYDRA. Silly, superficial, and preposterous, ""Ant-Man"" delivers scores of hilarious, but suspenseful shenanigans. <br/><br/>Until Marvel/Disney released ""Ant-Man,"" Hollywood had ignored all things petite in pursuit of the big, the bigger, and the biggest in its blockbusters. Meantime, the ever creative intellects at Marvel had been planning an ""Ant-Man"" movie since ""Shaun of the Dead"" director Edgar Wright had embarked on the project about a decade ago. Creative differences forced Wright out, and Reed took over the helm. Now, ""Ant-Man"" has emerged as the revelation of the summer, rather like the goofy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" did last summer. From concept to casting, everything about this mighty mite of a movie is nothing short of brilliant. Consistently entertaining on all levels, ""Ant-Man"" plumbs new depths in the superhero genre and provides former superstar Michael Douglas with his best role since director David Fincher's 1997 thriller ""The Game."" Romantic comedy leading man Paul Rudd of ""Role Models"" is the last guy you'd imagine as the diminutive Marvel hero. Nevertheless, the self-deprecatory Rudd succeeds with a combination of panache and charisma. He is a funny guy who doesn't try to be funny and comes off being even funnier. Like the eponymous creepy-crawlies that can tote ten times their body weight, ""Ant-Man"" delivers ten times more entertainment than most superhero sagas despite its downsized spectacle. Not surprisingly, this origins opus covers the roughly same ground that ""Iron Man"" did, but it does so with greater creativity on a considerably smaller scale. Clearly, those pests that habitually ruin your picnics have undergone a massive publicity campaign that places them as well as formulaic superheroes in an entirely different perspective.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""Ant-Man"" is antastic!"

"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","7","2","10","17 July 2015"," Ant-Man Review
","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Ant-Man. Again, Marvel is taking a risk bringing in another property that many people do not know anything about ah la Guardians of the Galaxy which turned out to be the sleeper hit for Marvel last summer. Sadly, Ant-Man does not compare to Guardians of the Galaxy and how good it was, but that is not to say Ant-man is bad--far from it--but, unlike Guardians that had me wanting to go see it again as soon as I could, Ant-man gives us a stand alone movie sort of.<br/><br/>What we get is pretty much the origin stories for a lot of new players going into Phase III next year, and whenever you are introducing new characters, you always have the difficult time of balancing their introductions and telling the main story. Ant-man has this problem at the beginning of the movie because they are trying to introduce Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and give us his motivation for doing the things he does, and it really falls short (maybe not ""fall short"" per se, but after seeing the reasons, you really don't feel for Scott and his plight). Scott was an employee for a big corporation that stiffed their costumers out of the money that they were due, and so Scott breaks in and steals the money back for the people. In doing so, he gets caught and sent to jail and his wife divorces him; at this point in the story, he is getting married to someone else. So, yeah, he had good intentions, but does that really make him a superhero?<br/><br/>Then, we get Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) who, in the comics and in the MCU, is the original Ant-man, and we are introduced to him as a man that does not want his tech to be used for nefarious means. Now, the man he groomed, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has taken over Pym Industries, found the old files of the Ant-Man project, and is doing exactly what Pym was afraid would happen.<br/><br/>So, much of the story could have been solved if the people in it had been honest and up front with those closest to them. Hank Pym pushed his daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), away from him when his wife died and kept her at arms length with a story that Hope knew was a lie. For the story purposes, I can understand why they did it; it lets us see a character that we probably wouldn't have seen otherwise. Secondly, his protegee, Darren, had heard hints about the Ant-Man project but was constantly told by Pym that it was just a myth. If Pym didn't want anyone finding out about his suit, why keep the files at his company instead of somewhere safe.<br/><br/>Now this might seem like I didn't enjoy the movie cause I am nit picking; and that is true, I am nit picking, but that is what we reviewers do, right? Paul Rudd, though, still doesn't feel like a superhero to me; he was good on screen and his humorous personality had me chuckling. Michael Douglas is great in his role as Hank Pym, and I was always looking forward to seeing him on camera. Evangeline Lilly had a few moments where she shined, and by the way it ended, we will be seeing some more badass moments from her. I am sorry to say the villain they gave Corey Stoll to play is just another one-dimensional bad guy that they throw at the hero so he has someone to fight against. Honestly, tough, I don't know the villain gallery for Ant-Man, so I don't know who else they could have brought in that might have been a bigger, better baddie. I wish Marvel would stop with these one-and-done villains. I know they are trying that with Thanos, but he is the only one they seem to be doing that for. Well, I guess Loki could be looked at in that light as well.<br/><br/>Like always, there are a ton of Easter Eggs to watch out for in this movie. You also get a mid-credit and end-credit scene, so make sure you sit through all the credits, and I will say that both of them were very good and leave you asking a lot of questions, especially for those that do not know a lot of the comic lore that is coming out in phase III.<br/><br/>My Recommendation:<br/><br/>See It.<br/><br/>For More Reviews Check out WWW.Shepfromtamp.com"

","""Scott, I've been watching you for a while, now. You're different. Now, don't let anyone tell you that you have nothing to offer."" Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas)<br/><br/>The little Ant-Man movie has much to offer: a likable, understated Marvel hero, a believable story of families in transition, and fewer explosions than any other blockbuster this summer or any time for that matter. In other words, it's my fav Marvel, a shrink-wrapped Iron Man with more humor than Tony Stark has altogether in his Avengers canon. Think a minimalist Guardians of the Galaxy to get an idea of the fun.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang/Ant-Man, an ex-con with a big heart, who wants to win visitation rights with his young daughter. Rudd has the sweetness, comic timing, and athletic composure to be a pint-sized hero with a smile: ""No, I'm the Ant-Man! I know, it wasn't my idea."" <br/><br/>Join him with classy-actor Michael Douglas as the scientist, Dr. Hank Pym, who started it all by creating the suit that could shrink Scott to bug size but with very big power (in the comics, Pym also created Ultron). Pym says, with characteristic seriousness and only a hint of sarcasm: ""This is not some cute tech like the Iron Man suit!""<br/><br/>It's not Hulk's size or Thor's hammer giving Ant-Man the otherworldly strength—it's the suit and the armies of insects he commands that can infiltrate even the most secure system. Rudd's low-key charm makes him standout from most Avengers for his diffidence and sense of irony. Tony Stark has the sense of humor but lacks Scott's everyman subtlety. Because Ant-Man is essentially about family bonds (even Pym needs his daughter's affection and allegiance), it has a more congenial and humane feel than other spectacles in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>Notice how CGI can take 30 years off Michael Douglas and also make us believe we are in Lilliput where our hero, Ant-Man, rides ""Anthony,"" a sizable flying insect. It's all summer fantasy but done with unusual grace and humor: <br/><br/>""Sorry I'm late, I was saving the world. You know how it is."" Scott"

","Ant-Man is the greatest, funniest and one of the most visually amazing movies to date. Scott Lang is armed with the ability to shrink but increase in strength and speed. X cat burglar Scott must harness the power of his Ant-Man suit with the help of its creator Hank Pym. Hank founded a science company called Pym-Tech and he hired a long time ago a young genius named Daron Cross, Daron was obsessed with knowing Hank's secret to his Pym particle. He voted Hank out of his own company and began research and development for the Pym particle all over again as Hank wouldn't give Daron the formula. Hank used to save the world as Ant-Man and his wife suited up as the Wasp, the Wasp went subatomic to shrink through the particles to disarm a missile. Daron after killing a businessman and many animals Daron found the correct formula for the shrinking particles and built the perfect battle armour called the Yellow Jacket. His idea was to create an army that could win every fight and battle that America would face. Starring Paul Rudd as Ant Scott Lang, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Evangeline Lilly, and Corey Stoll as Daren Cross, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Pena and Anthony Mackie as Falcon. As usual there is an after credit scene in this movie, It starts with Hank and his daughter Hope are walking into their basement which is where Hank keeps all his research. Hank tells Hope that her mother and he were working on a new Wasp suit and then he says that he realises that he was working on it for Hope. Ant-Man actually has two after credit scenes. The next one is of Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Sam Wilson (Falcon) have captured The Winter Solider and Steve says ""Don't tell Tony (Iron Man).

This is a slow-burning origin film and as such is driven solely by the characters in the story, thankfully, these characters, like the great origin film THOR, are well worth our attention. <br/><br/>The script is great and gives us plenty to enjoy and the effects of the shrinking are so well done that we barely think of them as effects (Always a good sign), the direction didn't detract and I never felt like it was lagging in any way and SPOILER ALERT when one of the characters was killed my 9 year old son was inconsolable END SPOILER ALERT. <br/><br/>Overall I was very impressed with Ant-Man and would recommend this simple narrative over the cluttered AGE OF ULTRON. Yes, Ant-Man isn't setting up three future movies but its simple tale is done terrifically well and I recommend it as a great cinema outing for children 8 and above.<br/><br/>Funny and Fun. A solid 8 out of 10."
"Bruce722","8","2","11","23 July 2015"," Great movie!
","Ant-Man was actually a really good movie, one of the better movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as of late. Paul Rudd was perfect for the role and the rest of the cast did marvelous (get it?). The movie took a little while to get going and it had one of the same drawbacks that the first Iron-Man had (where the villain can operate his suit with no practice whatsoever even though a large portion of the film is spent with the protagonist learning to control his ""powers"") but once it got going, the humor, action, and excitement was non-stop. Surprisingly, there was a fair amount of emotion as well, which helped connect the audience to the film. Overall, it's a must see for MCU fans and superhero fans in general but I think casual movie-goers will also appreciate it."
"atlihafsteinsson","9","2","11","22 July 2015"," The Surprise of the Year
","So far, 2015 has been a pretty disappointing year for blockbusters. The recent additions to the Jurassic Park, Terminator and, yes, Avengers story lines have all been fairly underwhelming and let the theater public down. But along comes Ant-Man, a lesser-known character in the Marvel universe, and stars in the most entertaining movie of the summer and, what's more, a well-deserved addition to the Marvel saga.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is excellently cast as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who longs to turn a new page so that he can be with his daughter. Just as he realizes that society isn't intent on giving him a chance, along comes someone who is - Hank Pym, who has invented a method of scaling a human being down in size while simultaneously increasing their strength. This technology has fallen into bad hands in his company, in particular the hands of maniacal CEO Darren Cross, whose shady intentions with the technology are plain. Thus, Pym and his estranged daughter work to put Scott up to a heist where he destroys all copies of the technology, with the help of the most undetectable partners imaginable - ants.<br/><br/>I can't imagine anyone but Paul Rudd pulling off Scott. He's got the comedy and humanity of the character down to a tilt, but he's frequently upstaged by his loudmouth friend and ex-cellmate, Luis, a theater-roaringly hilarious performance by Michael Peña. Ant-Man is fun across the board, exciting and plays with its themes of a man in a supersized world in consistently inventive ways. It strikes the balance between the themes of fun, action and serious that Age of Ultron so missed.<br/><br/>If you're a Marvel fan, you owe yourself not to miss Ant-Man. It's more than a worthy addition to the Marvel roster, and one of the most entertaining movies of the year. Don't be in a hurry to leave the theater, either - two last scenes that Marvel loves to put in their movies are really worth your time."

","This film tells the story of a criminal with a masters degree in electronic engineering who tries to take the right path for the sake of his daughter. Through strange twists of fate, he becomes an unlikely superhero called the Ant-Man.<br/><br/>The many posters for ""Ant-Man"" only emphasises the diminutive size of the new superhero in the Marvel collection, but to me they do not entice me to watch the film. After watching ""Ant-Man"" though, I was completely blown away.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" has a long build up because it is introducing an entirely new superhero. The build up is good, and characters all have distinctive personalities to make them different and interesting. I was captivated by the plot. It has so much action going on both action-wise and emotionally and I am still spell bound despite having left the cinema and arrived home. I really like the fact that there are two emotional subplots, one involving Paul Rudd and his daughter, and the other one between Michael Douglas and his daughter.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is an unlikely superhero film, because ants are not usually adored by people. To turn it into a great superhero film is quite an achievement. I really enjoyed watching ""Ant-Man""."
"sir_kerfy","9","2","12","6 August 2015"," Marvel's best movie of the year
","This movie is sheer fun from beginning to end. Even though it does suffer from an underdeveloped villain (which isn't too uncommon in Marvel movies)and a tie-in to the MCU that feels a bit forced, the chemistry of the actors, fun characters, amazing action sequences, beautiful CGI, and well-done comedy make Ant-man's flaws forgivable. It also proves that Marvel doesn't have to make everything on such a grand scale, as they did in this year's Age of Ultron, by making a movie that is enjoyable on a much smaller scale than many of the studio's other movies. To me, this was the best Marvel movie of the year and the funniest the studio has produced to date. I will never look at ants the same way."

","I have finally seen ant man and I can confirm that this film succeeds in its execution and ant man is a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe. The film Sees burglar Scott Lang forced to help his mentor hank Pym and become the ant man to do a heist to save the world. Now Paul Rudd plays Scott and he does a great job in the role because he isn't really an actor you could imagine as a superhero and they play that up. He is funny and relatable to the audience in the role and I though he got all the dramatic scenes he needed to do right as well and is one of my favourite heroes in this universe. clearly the best actor in this film is Michael Douglas as hank Pym and he is fantastic in this movie he nailed this character. He was funny when he needed to be he was dramatic when he needed to be and his chemistry with the other main characters was great too. Evangeline Lilly is an actress who has got her career back on track and she was great as hope. She was tough, but fun and likable which made her a good character in this film. Michael Pena is really good in the film with his humour being a good addition to the film. Corey stoll did a decent job as the villain it's just that he wasn't given much to do in this film and his character wasn't given allot of depth at all. The idea of the heist was a good story of the redemption of Scott Lang and I really liked how this story was a more personal story with Scott. I also liked the back stories of hank Pym and hope. But I think that they didn't give enough depth to certain aspects of the film like the villain and Scotts relationship with his daughter and it didn't hit the emotional punch that it was meant to. The script was mixed with some good humour and drama but sometimes it felt like that it didn't hit sometimes and that was due to different elements but it is a weakness of the film. The style was fantastic, all the cgi was great and the shrinking scenes really delivered like I hoped they would. The action scenes were all great and it really helped make this film great. Overall this is a great film and a great addition to the marvel films."

"mober1996","10","2","12","23 July 2015"," Stellar Movie for the Summer
","I have always said that Marvel has been able to conquer many things. Technological barriers, space, animations, and now the laws of physics. Not many know whom Ant-Man was before Marvel started production on this film. Most people associate Marvel with those such as The Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America. And it's because of this that gives me such a reason to love Marvel. Because basically, they do whatever they want, and I find that amazing.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is one stunning achievement and probably one of the most hilarious Marvel movies since ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"". Many people were worried that this film wasn't going to be anything astounding and over-hyped. But I am pleased to see just how wrong those people are. It was hilarious, the cast was impeccably well selected, and the visual play was incredible.<br/><br/>Honestly? There were no real problems with this movie from what I was able to tell. Not for me anyway. It was so easy to keep my interest throughout the entire film. And that is what matters most. And the post-credit scene? It is a bit of foreshadowing to not only Civil War, but also Infinity War. So make sure that you stick around for the VERY end.<br/><br/>There isn't a ton to review on this film that can't be summed up easily. So here is a thing to talk about. Why does Marvel do so much better than DC in the box office. Well I came to a conclusion that I believe most people can agree with. The characters of Marvel are more relatable. And no I don't mean you can gain super strength and green skin by being exposed to radiation and all that jazz. But the stories among all of the DC characters are about gods amongst men. They are not meant to be relatable anyway. The stories are there to have people cheer them on and say ""Wow."" Where as the characters of Marvel are meant to be seen as real people who have undergone extraordinary circumstances. Not become legends, but to become heroes. And that is what everyone wants to believe in. The story of Scott Lang is relatable, and most people would do what he would do to achieve his needs. ""Ant-Man"" is amazing and definitely worth a look. Final Score: 10/10"
"brandon_shinigami","9","2","12","17 July 2015"," The movie was a delight to have seen, I greatly recommend it.
","I watched this movie on it's opening, and I have to say, I wasn't disappointed in the least!! While it is similar to the Marvel origin movies before it, it takes an unique approach to the characters. The mentor/pupil relationship between Hank Pym/Scott Lang is a refreshing new addition to the series, along with Hank Pym's own relationships with his family. The chemistry between the three main characters is stunning, and the acting is spot- on, you'll never feel like you're simply watching an origin story. The new enemy of the series may not seem so unique on the surface (business man gone wrong), but Corey Stoll does a magnificent job in setting himself apart from the other villains of the series. Paul Radd's Scott Lang is also a great addition to the already great cast of the Avengers. He does a great job of not only making Scott Lang a very relate-able character, but you end up rooting for him the entire movie, even against some wonderful characters. The amount of humor he adds to the story feels well-paced and timed, never making the audience feel like the jokes are out of place or unnecessary. Ant-Man's unique powers are also a nice addition compared to what was seen before, his abilities to control ants and shrink really set it apart and not making you feel like it's just a battle of ""who's stronger."" Lastly, the fact it's a heist film in soul also adds much to story. It allows the character to understand and grow as the hero, while also allowing character development and drama that just ends up making you very invested in what's going on, while feeling well-paced. While still being a superhero Marvel film (so there's not as much worry in wondering if he will complete the job from the beginning), it endeavors to pull away from some hero stereotypes, and this is especially true near the end when the heist begins to start. I personally really loved the film, and think it's among Marvel's best. Much like Winter Solider, which had elements of a spy drama, it really sets itself apart from what we've seen, and reminds us that these movies still have much to offer us."

","Paul Rudd stars as ex-con Scott Lang, jailed for a lovably anti- corporate crime, now struggling to hold down a job and reconnect with his estranged daughter. Ant-Man nips nimbly back and forth between sizes, often within the space of a single leap. It's a peculiar superpower of which the film never quite gets the measure: bath-tub terrors and in-briefcase battles are fun, but action sequences in which Scott (Paul Rudd) mounts flying insects. Not great in action sequences, nor does the humor lasts. Instead, we're left pondering how much less engaging Rudd is than Robert Downey Jr, and how much more we laughed at the properly peculiar Guardians of the Galaxy. Ant-Man is another Marvel disappointment."

","Antman was something of an unusual beast as it scales down previous Marvel films and bumps up the comedy. Pretty strange for a superhero movie. But somehow it works. With the exception of some unrealistic reactions to situations or discoveries, the film really did a great job keeping me entertained. This movie utilizes traits from Iron Man, while not exactly meeting up to par with it. However, this movie exceeds many of the latest Marvel films that have been released.<br/><br/>With his comedic undertone and sarcastic wit, Paul Rudd is well-casted as the unlikely superhero. Simply put, he knows how to make a bizarre story work. Additionally, his character's friends really do confirm Ant-Man as the funniest Marvel film I've seen.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film for the people who are exhausted from Marvel's temptations to go for size rather than story."
"mockfilmreviews","7","1","4","24 January 2016"," Marvel takes a big chance with a small character.
","In the final stage of Phase 2, Marvel comes out swinging with the hero least likely: Ant-Man. This title made the general population not in the comics-know snicker at how silly a hero called Ant- Man (2015) sounded. But to the naysayers, I must protest. Least you forget the laughter bellowed through the internet as we were told that Vin Diesel would play a sentient tree or that Bradley Cooper would be voicing an anthropomorphized raccoon (which Rocket denies being, of course)? ""Marvel has lost it!"" we cried as our beloved heroes were becoming ridiculous. But in retrospect, it was a genius play by the filmmakers and our hearts were Marvel's once more. And Ant-Man is no exception.<br/><br/>When a newly paroled burglar Scott Lang (Rudd being unknowingly charming as hell) needs money to gain visitation rights to see his daughter, reclusive scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas, having a blast on screen) hires Scott for a heist that could save the world. Given a top secret suit, capable of shrinking the wearer to the size of an insect while retaining the strength of a full grown person. Oh yeah, and he controls ants. OK. It's a bit much to take in.<br/><br/>Like most all Marvel releases, Ant-Man keeps that tradition of page to screen sharpness and awe with both it's brilliant cast and tight link to the rest of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe. You're welcome.). Paul Rudd brings a lightness to the character that is hard not to like.—"
"dragoscarabet","7","1","4","13 January 2016"," A funny movie
","I didn't knew anything about Ant-Man before seeing this movie, but I really had a lot of fun watching it. I liked the actors, I found that Michael Pena (playing as Luis) is really funny, I wish there was more of him in the movie. The main actor, Paul Rudd which plays Ant Man was perfect for the role. The only reason why I gave such a 7 is that's not my type of movie and because I found everything happened way too fast (the training, the plot, the action etc.) My opinion is that this movie was made for teenagers who don't want any detailed explanation about how things work (the costume, the ant control etc.) and just want to see a lot of action. Maybe if I was still a teenager, I would have been more impressed by this movie, but I still recommended though."

It's always the superhero against the evil guy that wants to rule the world. And it's not even a spoiler if I say to you the superhero will win at the end because everyone knows that will be the end of the movie. Nothing wrong with that though. You know that's what you are going to get with Marvel movies. And this one is like that as well. When I read Ant-Man as the title I was wondering what an ant could have as super power considering we already had the bat, the spider, the hulk, the captain or whatever other hero. But in all fairness it was refreshing. I enjoyed it. Nice action movie with good actors. If there would be a sequel I probably would end watching it as well. Fun entertainment."
"jb_campo","8","1","4","2 January 2016"," Ant-man is Cool!
","Ant-Man is a cool movie that delivers the right combo of action, seriousness, drama, and comedy. The story revolves around the original founder, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) who discovers technology that can shrink a human to the size of ants. Not only that, but his technology also allows him to lead ants to help him in various ways.<br/><br/>20 years or so after the fact, Pym's protégé, Cross (Corey Stoll) is on the verge of finally replicating Pym's work, but he intends to make money from it, not benefit humankind. The battle is on between Pym and Cross, with Pym's daughter Hope (Evangenline Lilly) working undercover within Cross's organization.<br/><br/>Then enter Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a cat burglar extraordinaire who Pym deems as the best candidate to put on his Ant-Man suit that he has kept hidden all this time, and use his skills to stop Cross before it's too late.<br/><br/>The story is fascinating. The CGI is incredible, with the small sized combatants doing incredible stuff, and funny stuff too. The acting is really terrific from Douglas and Rudd, but a huge kudos to Rudd's partner in crime, Luis (Michael Pena), who delivers some incredible dialog that really blew me away with the editing to make it work big time. Cory Stoll really reminded me a lot of the performance of Ted Levine in Silence of the Lambs - very good stuff.<br/><br/>There's also a fantastic flashback scene of Pym when he was 20 or more years younger, and there was Michael Douglas, when he was late 30's or early 40's. How the CGI people do this is incredible - like the latest Terminator Genisys movie with Schwartzenegger from now fighting against the original Terminator.<br/><br/>At almost 2 hours length, it's just the right amount of story, as the movie moves along quickly. I had never heard of Director Peyton Reed, but after this success, I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him. It also looks like Ant-Man will get somehow tied into the Avengers series, based on the number of cross references between these movies.<br/><br/>Ant-Man delivers an excellent non-stop film that will leave you cheering. Crawl on down to watch it. Enjoy."

"Dr_Aristotle","8","1","4","26 December 2015"," The most fun I've had with a Marvl movie
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and it may end up being my favorite Marvel movie to date.<br/><br/>Like most of the recent Marvel movies, Ant-Man adds superhero elements to a different type of film, in this case a heist movie. A lot of the excitement and fun in the film comes from the merging of these two elements, which are otherwise carried out in a standard way. The movie is full of staples and clichés from both genres, such as the criminal who wants to go straight, the hero having a troubled personal life, the ""impenetrable"" building that has to be broken into, and so on. While this makes the movie fairly predictable, the advantage is that the movie maintains a brisk pace. Backstories, motivations, and relationships are all quickly established, formed, and explored, allowing for the humor and action to shine. <br/><br/>The characters, while not being particularly deep or complex, are still a lot of fun to watch. The performances are mainly good and invest you in the movie, Paul Rudd uses perfect comedic timing, which works all the more well because of how effective Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas play the straight men. Though all the characters, even the minor ones characters, get humorous moments throughout the movie. A lot of the enjoyment comes from the characters themselves having fun, which has been absent in a lot of superhero films. The characters enjoy what they're doing which adds levity to the movie and makes it engaging.<br/><br/>The plot itself is pretty standard, but provides a good backdrop to explore the abilities of Ant-Man, which are fantastically portrayed. This movie does an extraordinary job making ants, the ability to control them, and the ability to shrink all very cool. This is due to how the powers are used, with the ants and shrinking being used creatively and shot in a visually eye-catching way. The shrinking effect wonderfully conveys the scope of the environment, while the CGI is magnificent. There is a particular instance in the beginning, when CGI was used to de-age some characters, and it is unbelievable how realistic it looks. The movie makes sure to convey the size and space of everything in relation to the characters, making easy to understand who's doing what and where they're doing it.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much it's own thing, making it so that you don't have to have seen the other Marvel movies/TV shows to enjoy it. There are some easter eggs and cameos, one of which is particularly cool, none of which interrupt the story or flow of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this movie to all that want a fun, funny, lighthearted flick. I found it to be refreshing and highly enjoyable and look forward to the sequel."

","First of all I would like to say that I was one of the many people who thought that this film would not turn out well due to all of the problems and changes that happened during pre and post production. When the news broke that director Edgar Wright left the project and parted ways with Marvel, I was extremely worried about how this movie would turn out . I've always been a huge fan of his films and I consider him to be one of the most innovative and creative directors in the business but the bottom line is that he refused to tie his Antman film with the grander Marvel Cinematic Universe and he spent ten years developing the movie with no results. Anyways I truly think Peyton Reed knocked this movie out of the park. Paul Rudd was awesome as Scott Lang and the entire supporting cast was great. There was just the right amount of humor and the pacing and editing was top notch. The movie never drags and the special effects and action sequences were unbelievable cool. The best part of the film is seeing how Antmans powers work and the micro-verse he inhabits while he's in his shrinking form. I think Marvel really did a fantastic job and I can't wait to see the next installment in the Antman franchise. I consider Antman to be on the same level of entertainment as Captain America the Winter and Guardians of the Galaxy."

","Let's be honest here a movie called Ant-Man, which is about a guy who shrinks and talks to ants, has to be bad or at least belong to the ""It's bad that it's good category"" right? Well believe it or not Marvel did it again. Even though, this isn't that surprising since Marvel has been making pretty good movies over the years, many considered this one to be the big bomb of the Marvel franchise. This is because of a couple of reasons that I'll discuss in the review. So let's shrink our low expectations and let's enjoy Ant-man.<br/><br/>The movie starts with an exposition scene set in the past, which introduces us to a particle that can shrink a person or object. From this we go to the present and we see our protagonist Scot Lang who is being released from jail. He is a good, funny, everyday guy who wants nothing more than to spend some time with his daughter. However, because of problems that occur at the beginning of the movie he is only left with one option become the Ant-Man.<br/><br/>I know, the story sounds clichéd and I've still not persuaded you to watch this movie right? Well let me ask you this: What type of /or genre movie do you think this is? You're properly thinking about action, maybe a bit of drama or some of you may even have answered it's A MARVEL MOVIE!!, right? Well, believe it or not it's actually a Heist movie (compare it to Oceans Eleven) with a lot of good humor. The reason why I am really recommending this movie is because we don't see these type of movie very often, at least anymore. When is the last time you've seen a funny movie (good jokes, funny NOT OVER THE TOP moments and great timing), with a well-balanced atmosphere of action and feel good/warmth, AND It's actually good.<br/><br/>Credit has to be given when credit is due and personally I think the actors did a great job. Not with the acting mind you, but with their comedic timing. The protagonist played by Paul Rudd did a great job delivering his dialogues and expressions, which made it all feel very natural. Other great actors like Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly provided the necessary balance and gravitas to the movie. It has Michael Pena how can you go wrong! The music is nothing special by Christophe Beck, which is a shame, but it gets the job done. The movie uses a lot of CGI in combination with some practical effects, which helps the movie to ground its story. Based on the three act structure, the movie has a funny beginning, funny/great middle, and action packed ending. All in all, it's one of the best POPCORN Flicks of 2015 and I highly recommend it. Believe it or not but this is the first movie I've seen twice in a movie theatre since The Lord of the Rings Part 1.<br/><br/>Does that also mean that it is a good movie? Well that is a matter of perspective, but a dumbed down answer would be: it's an average movie. That is because, apart from all the positives, the movie does have some big negatives. Firstly, the story is told at a fast pace (good thing), but because of this some scenes are dumbed down to exposition, maybe with some script rewrites they could have fixed it. There are some plot holes (What movie doesn't). However, the biggest problem has to be the Antagonist, which the movie completely forgot to properly flesh out. However, apart from all of that and placed in the right context and genre MAN this is a good funny movie.<br/><br/>So what are the reasons why people thought this movie would bomb? The first reason, as aforementioned, is the premise of the movie, which is understandably a silly concept. Secondly, Marvel has been mostly making action/drama movies and even though The Guardians of the Galaxy was a funny roller-coaster ride, it was still mainly an action movie. This movie is a humor movie, which is uncharted waters for Marvel. And the third and biggest reason: the great Edgar Wright (producer/director of the CORNETTO TRILOGY) worked on the script for years and in the end dropped out. The script was then pushed back and forth and had some rewrites resulting in the current end product, which was a cause for concern for some people.<br/><br/>But hey I've been talking long enough. So all in all what am I saying? Ant-man is a GOOD funny movie with a lot of heart. And I certainly recommend this to everyone. No, you do not have to see any previous MARVEL movie, but if you have then it would only become better. Normally, I would type something funny or a movie related pun, but I'm tired and I've to get up early for work tomorrow, so I'll just say this: Watch this movie it's well worth your time.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7."

A superhero version of Honey I Shrunk The Kids. Paul Rudd was the perfect choice for this role. These movies have become review proof, either you are all in on this series or your not.

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","7","1","4","5 December 2015"," Nothing special
","MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) has given us some spectacular movies (The Avengers; Age of Ultron), some great movies (The Winter soldier; Guardians of the galaxy) and some good movies (The Incredible Hulk). All in all, MCU never let us down and always gave a good time. The quality was always top notch, but the movies themselves varied form just fun (The Incredible Hulk) to really great ones (The winter soldier). So, as the last movie in Phase two, a question emerges - where does Ant-Man stand in that interval? <br/><br/>The truth is, Ant-Man is closer to the fun movies than the great ones. It delivers exactly what all the trailers presented - a fun entertaining flick. Now, if this was not a part of MCU where no collision with other MCU movies and superheroes was present, this would have been a flop. And that says a lot. <br/><br/>Now, the acting itself is quite good, Rudd is as always fun to watch, and his ability to cross over between a likable comic goof and a real dramatic superhero is to be respected. So to cast him as Ant- Man was a success. Douglas is as always, great and gave a lot to the MCU franchise. He did not impose too much on the others and gave them enough space to develop and show what they have to offer. A gesture not many would do. Lilly was a bit of a letdown. I expected more form her but it goes to show that she was not right for the role. Her beauty is distracting (as it should be) but when combined with good acting she can be a lot more impressive (like in the Hobbit series). Here, I had the feeling, she didn't quite know how to approach the character or portray her, even with the help of an acting master such as Douglas. But aside from the main cast, Stoll was the worst. I don't like to say someone gave a bad performance but he really did a bad job. An MCU villain needs to be psychotic, crazy, have world domination plans etc., etc. Stoll's character was all those things, but Stoll just didn't portray him properly. The black and white characterization is something MCU does best, but an actor has to do the job right. He really didn't have that hard of a job, and he blew it. So the villain part just wasn't acted out right. Unlike Iron man 3 where it is unclear what is going on with the bad guys and no true villain actually exists, here that is quite obvious and that saves the storyline and the movie altogether. <br/><br/>As for the story, well, MCU never really had spectacular Oscar winning story lines and scripts, but they were always functional and fun with no real loopholes or problems. That is also the case with Ant-man. A fun story with predictable but likable outcomes and good character development with a nice emotional layer and an Avengers crossover. So all in all Ant-Man does the job just right. <br/><br/>What is the problem? Well, the timing. Ant-Man would have been a lot more interesting as the first movie in phase three than the last one in phase two. Simply putting it, it just couldn't compete with Age of Ultron or Winter soldier. The audience was staggered with Winter soldier and Ultron that when Ant-Man came out, everyone expected something like the last two installments. That is a natural human reaction and is completely understandable. Does Ant-Man deserve to a part of MCU - definitely. Is it as good as the rest of MCU movies - yes. A better timing with the release of the movie and a wiser casting could have made this movie better. But all in all, just like The Incredible Hulk, when it's on TV I'll sure as Hell see it over and over again."

","I grew up in a time here in England when the BBC used to show wonderful late night movie seasons on BBC2 (sadly no longer)there were Hammer and Sci-Fi seasons and a wonderful film called ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" was brought to my attention, a wonderfully scripted film by Richard Matherson.<br/><br/>Ant Man is something of an updated version of that film for a modern MARVEL generation. This is at the other end of the spectrum of MARVEL movies to the likes of The Avengers, Iron Man and Captain America and i'm grateful for that, it's a wacky, quirky, fun movie more akin to ""Guardians of the Galaxy""<br/><br/>I'm delighted Marvel aren't just focusing on the crowd pleasing all-action Blockbusters (although they are fun aren't they?) and i get the feeling that the upcoming ""Dr Strange"" could be something quiet different again.<br/><br/>Ant Man is a delightful Superhero heist/origin movie with some fun little in-jokes (i liked the Poltergeist one) and Mr Rudd gets a role that should catapult him up to superstar!<br/><br/>A great support cast especially from the beautiful Evangeline Lilly but it's Michael Douglas that really stood out for me (it's been awhile since we saw this truly great actor in a great role) and as Pym Marvel choose wisely as he added much needed gravitas to the film.<br/><br/>I would guess that most having seen this film would comment 'Yeah, Better than i thought it was going to be' as it's a crowd pleasing, fun film and look forward to seeing Ant Man join up with The Avengers, he's a quirky addition to the Marvel film universe (like Star Lord)"
"sanjayvjr","9","1","4","29 November 2015"," Phase 3 in the Marvel Franchise has taken a new attempt that should be applauded for, even if it doesn't pack the best performances.
","REVIEW: ANT-MAN(2015) Cast: Paul Rudd, Micheal Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, and Micheal Peña Directed by: Peyton Reed Release Date: July 17, 2015 Production: Marvel Studios Rated:PG-13<br/><br/>When people make fun of you for being short and puny, you can now say that isn't something to ashamed of. As of July 17, 2015, you are a superhero. Ant-Man is Phase three in the Marvel Universe and is directed by Peyton Reed, the director of movies such as ""Yes Man"". It stars Paul in the main and Michael Douglas as the bearded scientist. Ant-Man is a rollicking amount of fun, and by far is the best movie this summer. It's an extremely fun visual popcorn adventure. <br/><br/>Forced out of his own company by former protégé Darren Cross, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits the talents of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a master thief just released from prison. Lang becomes Ant-Man, trained by Pym and armed with a suit that allows him to shrink in size, possess superhuman strength and control an army of ants. The miniature hero must use his new skills to prevent Cross, also known as Yellowjacket, from perfecting the same technology and using it as a weapon for evil.<br/><br/>As usual, the main character's boss gets in a complete mess and it's up to the superhero to fix it. What's really nice about this movie is how they portray it. Throughout this movie there are many Civil War developments (spoilers,especially the end credits scene), and are portrayed very smoothly and nice. The characters make you care for them in every bit of the story. Now, Paul Rudd is honestly the king of the show. He shows himself as a bad-ass good guy and also as a protective father. The only major drawback in this film was the villain. Corey Stoll's HoneyJacket was overdone and played awful and to be honest, Corey Stoll is just an OK villain, with an evil look. Hey, that's all you really need. But still, it was a major drawback. Also, as Michael Douglas is getting older, his emotions and actions seem to be fading away. A once amazing actor has nothing special to offer in this movie.<br/><br/>The graphics in this movie are simply superb. The graphical train fight scene and all the others were shot and edited with heavy perfection and effort. Running through the movie, not once would you notice the difference between the graphics and reality. The BGM draws you in to that deep extent that most superhero movies don't achieve. They lit the performances and action with their fast and heavy-beated music, and also broke the laughter at times with the rock music in the middle.<br/><br/>Yes, this is definitely what every superhero plot sounds like, but just with a different kick. The superhero is a ant. The screenplay moves along just fine accompanied with Michael Peña's and Paul Rudd's witty one-line comedies and Paul Rudd packs a fine performance even if you would expect less from him. The BGM Is just breathtaking and it just moves you off the edge of your seat. Overall, Ant-Man is a well executed superhero movie."
"Jerghal","8","1","4","21 November 2015"," Funnier and lighter than most Marvel films
","Once Ant-Man was in the hands of creative genius Edgar Wright. He got removed from the production most likely because he didn't get along with the Disney/Marvel suits who wanted him to bend to their rules. So enter Peyton Reed, director of Yes Man and Down with Love as the new man behind the wheel.<br/><br/>Before the movie came out I was thinking: a tinny man, what can he ever do when you have the Avengers with all the destructive power...but they addressed and even poke fun at those preconceptions and also answer that question.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is cast well as the Ant-Man. He plays it with plenty of charisma and comedic flair. Michael Douglas is also pretty cool as Paul's mentor. Evangeline Lilly of lost fame plays Douglas' daughter and besides a good actress she's also easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>The story isn't as large scale as the Avengers or the Guardians of the Galaxy but that actually is a refreshment and the film lighter and provides excellent entertainment. The VFX are also very well done as they look pretty convincing.<br/><br/>So I would recommend you see it even if you are getting a bit tired of the constant barrage of superhero movies as it is sufficiently different and as such adds something to the Marvel universe."
"mukherjeesubham93","7","1","4","10 November 2015"," A 'small' surprise!
","I didn't have very high expectations out of 'Ant Man', I felt it was just another marvel move to get the cash registers ringing, which they do, but of recently I have felt marvel has erred on their approach to movies. While 'Captain America: The winter soldier' was a great addition, 'Thor: the dark world' was just about okay. Iron man 3 was simply a goofy move which I think didn't go down well, at least with me. The biggest of them all the recent avengers movie was also a bit underwhelming. Though the box office tells you a different story in case of all the above mentioned movies.<br/><br/>Ant man more than anything else is like a breath of fresh air, just when marvel movies were becoming predictable. Also, marvel's recent infatuation with a lot of humor in their movies, seems to sit comfortable on this one, like last years guardians of the galaxy, unlike Aou, humor ruined the movie a bit I think.<br/><br/>Story is certainly not Ant man's usp, but the breezy treatment is. Paul Rudd is great as scott lang\ ant man. His comic timing is perfect and he almost charmes you into liking the movie. Michael douglas as Hank pym is good too. Special mention for michael pena.The shrink scenes work wonders and are amazing. Watch out for the fight between Yellowjacket and ant man in a suitcase!<br/><br/>On the downside, the film has an excuse of a story. The villain is not convincing enough. Also a lot of plot holes do come between you enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, ant man is more of a hit than a miss, humour sits well in this one. A possible sequel is already underway. Looking forward! Rating: 7/10"

","People I know laughed at the title and laughed at me for taking an interest in the film despite my interest in nanotechnology and the subatomic universe. However, after watching it, I can safely say that this film is the best as it is emotional on so many levels and it is hilarious and the best thing is that I have overcome my fears of ants.<br/><br/>When I first seen the trailer, back in November 2014, I was instantly hooked by the theme of second chances as well as the theme between a father and daughter including the trailer music. The trailer music is really uplifting and touches the soul.<br/><br/>I have said it so many times to myself and to people, that Marvel sure know how to please their audiences and I am proud to say that Ant- Man surpassed my expectations by making such a laughable character - to many people especially DC fans - into something enjoyable as well as fun and relatable. Marvel meticulously plan their films years before the release date and the final product is implemented perfectly. <br/><br/>The action scenes are amazing and there is never a dull moment in this film especially with the casting of Michael Peña as Luis - Lang's former cellmate. He is pure comedy genius in this film.<br/><br/>At first, when Iron Man was released, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was relatively small, but like Ant-Man, the universe has grown and it will grow beyond. <br/><br/>Just you DC fans wait! Batman V Superman and the DC Cinematic Universe will never ever replicate the same level of success the Marvel Cinematic Universe has achieved."
"halils6959","8","1","4","8 November 2015"," it's about how you tell the story
","Yeap, this was a good movie for me. Some people wrote things like ""omg ant-man's fighting style is incredibly good"", or ""shrinking is cool bro"" and so forth. But seriously why many critics, viewers and me think that this is probably the best marvel adaptation so far.. it's because the way to tell a story -and sometimes independent of what the story is- may turn a dull film into a great one. Real humor and an above average acting as well as choosing the ""right"" actors can combine into a high quality result. In the core of it lies the script. But directing plays a huge part also. I strongly wish there were more of this kind of adaptations."
"billcr12","7","1","4","7 November 2015"," Good Action
","If you have ever wished to see swarms of ants helping fight evil doers, then this is your movie. Paul Rudd is likable as the title character,a burglar who is released from jail and tries to go straight, and through a series of events, ends up helping a scientist and inventor(Michael Douglas) and his daughter(Evangeline Lily) prevent a bad guy from destroying the world as we know it. O.k., nothing original as far as the story goes, but this is based on a Marvel comics book, not Shakespeare. The visuals are stunning and Douglas and Rudd work well together, so just relax and be entertained for a couple of hours. The film does what an action flick should do, which is provide escape from the real world for a while."
"Prismark10","6","1","4","6 November 2015"," That shrinking feeling
","I guess a lot of people thought (me included) that this could be the one Marvel Film that could flop at the box office. Not helped by the late change in director as Edgar Wright walked out after developing the project for years. The marketing of the film also seemed unfocused.<br/><br/>The opening part of the film did not hold out much hope. Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a down on his luck ex-con. He has recently got out of jail, cannot hold a decent job because of his criminal record. His ex-wife is about to marry a cop and he has trouble getting access to his daughter because he cannot pay child support.<br/><br/>His friends persuade to him to take part in a heist and this is when we find out that Lang is just a little more than a cat burglar but someone rather smart, resourceful and cunning. However his efforts in trying to break into an impregnable safe rewards him with just a funny kind of costume. A costume which he discovers has special powers that shrinks him. Lang is arrested when he tries to give the costume back.<br/><br/>Lang is contacted in jail by scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas.) In an opening flashback we see that he worked for Shield. Now he has been forced out of his company by his own protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) and estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly.) <br/><br/>Pym has mastered the technology in developing a suit that shrinks but also has a device that controls ants. He did not want the project to fall into wrong hands. Cross has been developing his own similar project unsuccessfully. His Yellowjacket so far fails to shrink and we soon find out that he will stop at nothing.<br/><br/>Pym thinks it is only a matter of time before Cross will succeed and Lang is persuaded to develop his skills with Pym as mentor. Hope who has realised that Cross has gone too far is his trainer. Together with an army of intelligent ants, Lang learns how to shrink and de-shrink in an instance as well as learn how to do combat.<br/><br/>Lang teams up with his band of ex-cons to break into Cross's firm and destroy the suit assisted by Hope still in the inside.<br/><br/>There is nothing original about Ant Man in the Marvel film universe, well apart from that he shrinks in size and never gets stepped on. It is the usual case of an ordinary guy, who has got the wrong end of the stick in life, develops superpowers via a suit, learns how to use it and goes after the bad guys. This is the initial part of the set up and the film takes it time getting there. It only really finds the right gear in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>There is very little else in the plot that will shake you. Hank's protégé is bald so just think Jeff Bridges in Iron Man. Cross immediately is shown to be evil so no surprises there.<br/><br/>This leaves with Rudd giving enough of a quirky performance which is mainly the reason why he was cast. He is just right being the every man loser, wanting to do the right thing. He is charming, funny in an understated way and likable, less of a grunt compared to other Marvel Film characters. Of course he needs to be quirky and off beat when the concept is a man that shrinks to an ant.<br/><br/>When you see some of the action sequences, especially at the climax, I think it is clear that Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish's script elements have been maintained with a big influence from, dare I say Wallace & Gromit. Just look at that scene involving Thomas the Tank Engine.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is ably assisted by Michael Pena and his gang of misfit ex-cons. Douglas is solid as Hank, suspicious of Shield, Cross and ghosts from the past.<br/><br/>Although it does not at times feel like a Marvel film their are enough references to Shield and Avengers as well as an Avengers sidekick flying in.<br/><br/>It looks like Marvel were right to have faith in Ant-Man as he was punched above his size at the box office."

","The story was a little predictable, but enough to look past that little problem. The villain didn't seem fleshed out enough, I would have liked to see more of him and learn more about why he does what he does. This problem could be fixed in a Marvel Short. The main character, Scott Lang, was likable and I felt fore him and his cause. Hope was bitchy through like half the movie then just changes in an instant after a single event, this could have been fleshed out more. Also the comedic parts were abrupt sometimes and cut into dramatic scenes, this felt out of place and distracting.<br/><br/>The acting of the side characters were great, Michael Peña was funny, T.I. was funny and David Dastmalchian's character had a bad accent, but it was funny. Michael Douglas did great acting, and Evangeline Lilly overacted in some parts, but still did good throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>The camera work was OK, the only really cool parts where when he was small, the rest of the time it was just OK.<br/><br/>Ant-Man was a good movie, worth a watch, and I will buy it. It feels more like a comedy movie than an action Marvel movie, but since it was written by comedic writers that wasn't hard to figure out. It was a fun time and it was a good break from all the Marvel movies that feel like all they have to be is action."
"dkeitho","10","2","13","8 August 2015"," Action packed and family fun
","The Ant-Man movie was very well rounded. It had a little bit of everything. It's hard to make origin stories exciting, but Marvel seemed to pull it off without a hitch. The best way for movies like these, is when the casting director picks an actor from a different genre. Then, when the actor steps out of their element, and nails the role, everyone benefits. This movie was given a lot of criticism due director change and an relatively unknown comic book character. Any character, as long as you have a good story, actor, director, will come into its own. You don't need big names or big budgets, just talented and committed individuals. Ant-Man arrived in comic books in the 60s, founding members of the Avengers, but always seemed to be a background character. Background characters can be just as interesting or as exciting as the main character. It can be aggravating for a fan when everything isn't included or something is altered in a movie. You just can't fifty plus years of information in a two hour movie and please everyone. I believe Marvel would profit to make an Ant-Man 2, as long as they cast a new and unique villain to challenge this new media hero."

"nicolechan916","6","1","5","12 March 2016"," Great visuals and acting, but awkward screenplay.
","After the slew of Marvel films, one comes to expect a certain level of standard. And while the CGI, costumes, effects and acting were all great, I have a real issue with the screenplay. My overall sense of the film is that it was rushed into production and made in a quick manner (perhaps they had to seeing as Captain America: Civil War was coming out). <br/><br/>I am genuinely surprised that Paul Rudd could pull off being Ant- man. He was both charming and charismatic and managed to capture the essence of his character. Normally when I watch Paul Rudd movies, I tend to notice him as an actor and not the character, but in this film I totally regarded him as Scott Lang. Michael Pena's character is both hilarious and annoying at the same time. His jokes and speech delivery is something that I have not seen that often, and so made me laugh more than it bugged me. As well, the addition of Dastmalchian and T.I. helps to bring some comedy to the film. Evangeline Lilly does a good job with her character and what little she is given to work with. An obvious statement, but women characters need to be given more credit and in particular action instead of keeping them on the sidelines and having them be controlled by men. Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll are both mediocre in their roles, as quite often their delivery and movements come off as mechanical. <br/><br/>Going off that, I found the script to be very cliché and awkward. The dialogue just went from A to B, and though it could be an issue with delivery, I think it is more to do with the actual screenplay itself. Conversations were so one directional in that it was quite predictable what would happen. Also, what I mean by saying that the dialogue went from A to B, is that there was no build up or 'small talk' so to speak. It was all business, and did not feel natural. This didn't happen for the entire film, but it was noticeable enough for me to laugh out loud at how horrible some of the dialogue was. <br/><br/>However, the visual effects were the highlight of the film. I'm not talking about the numerous explosions that seem necessary to any superhero film, but rather the combination of cinematography and CGI. The film displays beautiful shots that plays with levels of depth. Unfortunately, this feels more like an add-on and a side thought, as the shots last for less than a minute and there aren't many of them. One such shot can be seen in the trailer, when Ant- Man runs atop the barrel of a gun and the 'camera' pans to the right. I especially like how in that scene, the background is blurred and viewers are made to focus on the little figure. Also, I thought that the imaging of the ants was pretty cool. Though they do look robotic that might just be because I haven't really looked at ants up close much. <br/><br/>Speaking of the ants, it was cool the way they collectively came together to build formations. In one scene on water, my friend commented that he actually saw ants do that before, and so it is great to know that the film-makers actually did some research into ant formations."

","In many ways this is an odd addition to the Marvel universe. As the films seem to get bigger and bigger with each one, Ant-Man is surprisingly small (as the title suggests). It is not just the character, but also the plotting – it is not really a world-beating foe here, but just a simple robbery (albeit for an unique item). In doing so, the film gets to do what so many of the other films do (have fun at its own silliness), but it benefits by not having to deliver a massive universal conclusion too.<br/><br/>In some ways the film plays to this well, and it has some very funny moments along with a general sense of fun; however at the same time it always feels like it is not quite firing on all cylinders either. Of course Edgar Wright famously left the film in the middle, and one does have to wonder how much more spark he would have brought to the final film if he had been allowed to. There is still a lot to enjoy about its silliness (the final fight on the train, and Thomas the Tank Engine himself being a great example), but too much of it seems ordinary, albeit with the extraordinary narrative device. It is expensively produced, and has some clever sequences, but the most fun moments do tend to highlight that not enough of the film is up there.<br/><br/>The cast work hard and mostly do well. Rudd is fun, although when in shrunken action mode, his key appeal is less evident as he is an effect not a character. Peña is not the second name on the cast list by a mile, however he is one of the best bits of casting, and his comedic delivery produces some of the most fun moments (the story- telling montages). Douglas, Lilly, Stoll, Cannavale, Harris, Donovan, and others are all solid, but nobody really goes out of their way to make it their best work or even close. In the end Ant- Man is a fun blockbuster, even if it is not as consistent, nor as fun, as it should have been."

","I must admit I have seen some rather impressive comic based movies lately, that must have lulled me into a false sense of security.<br/><br/>Somewhat new Marvel offering Ant-Man had all the possibilities to be a rather enjoyable adventure action film: a fun concept about a guy changing size, comic books that nobody really cares so the film makers should be able to paint with almost any sort of brush, good actors cast and above all, the movie was reported to be a comedy, so maybe it would give us something more than the usual fare about a loser changing his life for the better through unbelievable super powers (whilst simultaneously learning humility and that Uncle Ben was right). Even the trailer looked quite okay.<br/><br/>And how hard can a disappointment be.<br/><br/>I haven't despised anything related to Marvel Comics this much since X-Men Origins: Wolverine. And even though Ant-Man isn't quite the same mile stone of ineptitude, the curve of annoyance was pretty much stabilized to pretty much the same level. <br/><br/>But let's start with the positive: the movie is, of course, very visually appealing. That is rather expected from a budget this size, but the pomp and circumstance even has some sense of style behind it.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly is by far the best the movie has to offer, since her role most resembled a real character. Oh, if only this movie would have been about her. Michael Douglas was there too, somewhere, and he is, of course, a very fine actor. In smaller role we had Bobby Cannavale from the outstanding Boardwalk Empire. Even our main lead Paul Rudd didn't seem to be a completely charisma free, zero-interest lump of wasted resources, and if the script would have been something else than a puddle of repulsive night soil even he might have amounted to something.<br/><br/>There is a scene where Ant-Man battles Falcon, and this moment had a real Marvel Comics -feel to it. Luckily it was over in an instant.<br/><br/>Then to those bad aspects. Somehow I have a feeling this list is going to be longer.<br/><br/>The ""humour"" of the film - term here applied with it's laxest meaning - was absurdly horrible. As if a modern, American sitcom that had three episodes made before mercifully putting it out of it's misery was submerged with to the worst humorous episodes of Baywatch. Pseudo-clever, nerdy blathering of nothingness with internet terminology sprinkled in. To take a scene straight out of Spider-Man and do it in exactly the same way, but end it in some forcedly awkward one liner is not, has not ever been and will not never ever be funny.<br/><br/>And don't let me start on the so called comic relief characters, that manage to form a level of nail scraping on the black board all by themselves. These three wacky comrades who come from the rogue-like background of our main character and have no reason to reside in the movie after the first few scenes, even get to say their last words in the piece. They act and talk like an internet meme made flesh with satanic magic and pure evil.<br/><br/>No Rob Schneider, no Adam Sandler, no Marlon Wayans has ever been equal to the grotesque awfulness that this movie calls it's side characters. And decides we should care about them on some level. Jar Jar Binks is the best thing that has ever happened to the art form of film making after these dudes.<br/><br/>Before the release of the film people talked about the main character being an anti hero. This is all fine, since I adore anti heroes. But what does this mean in Ant-Man's case? That the protagonist is contained in a prison in the beginning of the film for braking the law for a really good reason.<br/><br/>Goddamn, you guys. Watch Dirty Harry. Watch A Clockwork Orange. Watch Escape from New York. Those films star anti heroes. This is the same, used and abused Spider-Man again with his troubles with family members and endless babbling about the mythology of heroes than always before, now just with a very slightly edgier, calculated finish. No personality to be found here. Uninteresting banana peel on the floor of existence only fitting for a first person shooter video game.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas gets lost into his wannabe Obi-Wan -role, and the most he gets to do is mumble directions to our protagonist's earplug and have at least five obligatory speeches about the importance of heroism, the joy of helping others and blah blah bloody blah.<br/><br/>The antagonist simply could not be any more boring. Characteristicly speaking ethereal, hairless plank of wood. To have a completely unmemorable block of cheese and then have the same powers as the lead for the end is only horribly stupid and unimaginative. Actually it's so sad state of affairs there should practically be a law against it. Doesn't Marvel have enough baddies to put into their movies? Is this Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III -style nonsense truly necessary? <br/><br/>In the end, what we have here is a movie equivalent for an atrocious, smoking pile of toxic waste. If you want to see a humorous super hero film, rather watch Steel. Yes. Even that is a better film. Or reward yourselves and see Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, for it is actually funny and has a successful adventure plot. I mean, sure; it's overtly cute fun for the whole family, but so is this. <br/><br/>This much of horrible indifference with no soul is that cancer that threats to engulf the entire fictive entertainment business. This could, and should, have been almost anything but what it is - but then, that would have demanded some imagination and love for the art instead of just shoveling CGI spurts to the faces of the wife beater and stench of sweat wearing audience."

","I could care less about Marvel, so my review of Ant-Man is not influenced by how it fits into the Marvel scheme of things.<br/><br/>As a movie, I found Ant-Man to be decidedly so-so. I watched it at home and, while I wasn't bored, I found my attention wandered from time to time. I didn't think anything about the movie (plot, script, characters, acting) was good or bad...just so-so.<br/><br/>I thought Michael Douglas got the best deal in terms of an actual role to play. I think Rudd's talents were somewhat wasted, perhaps because he spent a lot of time being Ant-Man rather than a regular guy, which is his strength. Corey Stoll was reasonably cast as the bad guy, but didn't have much to work with, and didn't do much with it. Pena worked a bit too hard to try to bring some humor to the movie.<br/><br/>I gather the CGI was technically good. I leave the CGI to others to critique. My perspective is that, typically, the more people talk about the CGI, the less good the movie. Ant-Man hasn't made me reconsider this perspective."

I still can't see how Ant-Man is gonna feature in a serious Avengers Movie as the whole concept seems a Parody of itself.. Still!

","I'm not going to complain about the physics of the movie, since, you know, just pretend it's a universe in which this works. What really bothers me is the plethora of exactly-at-the-right-moment coincidences, long shots and the ultra long shots. Picture a plot where an average billiard player aims to hit a ball with a ball to hit another ball which hits another ball and sinks another ball, then sinks two more and itself. Just casually. No one is really impressed after. There are lots of such things in this flick.<br/><br/>Alright, so the movie is really well made, the actors play their part, the visuals are good, the physics are forgivable, but the plot was written by a six-year old.

I love how Marvel ties other superheroes in with all their various films, it's a great way to build interest in other characters and story lines. These movies are making me want to seek out all of the old comic books and collect some of the new ones. I'm truly looking forward to the next Ant Man movie.

","Even though this is a lesser entry in the Marvel Canon, ""Ant Man"" still isn't the failure Iron Man 3 is (at least in my opinion) and provides an average blockbuster with some interesting new visuals.<br/><br/>I feel a bit mixed on the cast. Rudd, Lily and Douglas are definitely the better performances here and even though none of these actors are on their true A game and fall in some missteps they do manage to come through and solidify their place in the MCU and open good possibilities for their future in it. The other side of the cast is really underwhelming in my opinion. I don't see what people are talking about when they mention Pena, I have never been a fan of his to start with but here he is just throwing lines and despite having two bright moments he was just dull for me. Worst of all is Corey Stoll whom I absolutely admire, especially for his brilliant work in House of Cards, but here his performance is one of the worst we have had from the MCU unfortunately.<br/><br/>Visually the film is as always with Marvel overfilled with CGI, yet it manages not to be so bothering and offers some wonderful moments at times. The shrinking sequences especially early on were certainly the best parts of the film. I also applaud the movie for managing to be organically involved in the MCU without ever feeling the need to push it, it stroke a perfect balance and it made for very good moments. Finally the movie isn't as funny as people have made it out to be, there are some laugh out loud moments, but there are many more that fall flat. Overall I almost always had a smile on my face, but I never gasper or rolled on the floor laughing. That smile on the face was definitely kept on it by a very good score, a fluent pace and something always interesting be it visually or story-wise happening on screen. On the other hand, the story is a messy and the characters are uneven, but it never reaches the level of being truly bothering, by the end of the film it does round up things acceptably.<br/><br/>I think that except for Iron Man 3, this is the least palatable film we have been offered by Marvel, it bears much of the same problems the previous films have, yet it doesn't have enough of what made those films really good despite those problems."
"luke-a-mcgowan","6","1","6","17 August 2015"," Ant-Man is fun if you don't want anything groundbreaking
","As the Marvel Cinematic Universe starts to get stale, Ant-Man for me was the one that would make or break it. Either it'd be so fresh that it'd bring on a new wave, or it'd be so generic that it'd kill the whole thing for me. What it does - well, it sits somewhere in the middle. Its not the make or break, it just prolongs the question and I guess we'll see next year.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is Scott Lang ""the Ant Man"" (I was terrified going in that this film would be like the trailers, trying to make fun of the awful name). Rudd is adequate - he's not Hemsworth or Pratt, but he's not Norton's Bruce Banner either. His attempts to be charming are actually quite grating at times - such as one supposedly fun scene where he ruins a nice moment between Douglas and Lilly, and then realises on screen. Oh you shouldn't have said that? No duh. Is this meant to make us like him?<br/><br/>My favourite performances of the cast were Corey Stoll and Michael Douglas. Stoll is a diabolical villain, probably the best human villain in the MCU since Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane. Unfortunately, he also comes across as a frothing lunatic, because his screen time is so minimal that Stoll has to overact in order to establish himself as a villain at all. Its not bad - his disregard for any life makes him truly terrifying, demonstrated in a few incredible scenes that I won't spoil, and Stoll's sheer presence is always incredibly menacing, which Peyton Reed uses to great effect. Michael Douglas is a world class actor, and unlike a few other similar actors in the MCU like Redford, Rourke and Close, he's given a decent role to play AND he does something with it.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly, hiding underneath probably the worst hairstyle brought to screen since the invention of the toupee, plays a character so generic that you can pick the whole movie from her. She's the distant child who calls her father by his first name. She's the tough chick who doesn't actually do anything. The love interest who doesn't like you until the end of the film. She's the assistant to the bad guy who has a change of heart. If she was any more generic, her name would be John Smith. Lilly may try, but its hard to tell when her role is so cookie- cutter. Bobby Canavale is given a nothing role that now prevents him doing anything good in the MCU, much like Glenn Close and John C. Reilly were in Guardians of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>The CGI in this film is amazing - especially a digitally youngified Michael Douglas, and some awesome ant sequences. The sound mixing is also really terrific, and you only notice that sort of thing when its really good. I did really enjoy Peyton Reed's direction of the action scenes in particular - the seamless cuts of big-to-small were delightful, and the two funniest scenes in the film were perfect transitions from high-intensity, high drama action to the zoom out shot that reminds you how low the stakes are.<br/><br/>I will always wonder what Edgar Wright's screenplay was, because this is pretty darn generic. Its the same origins story you've heard a thousand times over, and I'm not going to bother touching on it. Because Wright's script was ditched for more generic fare, however, the only laughs I got were the aforementioned transition shots. The rest of the screenplay is filled with generic lumps like ""clear your mind. Focus on your daughter and it'll help.""<br/><br/>Ant-Man isn't groundbreaking, but its solid. It lacks the enjoyability of Guardians, Iron Man or Thor, but it doesn't insult me like Winter Soldier or Iron Man 3. It ranks somewhere around the middle, which is just enough to recommend it, I suppose."

","This my spoiler free review to the brand new edition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Ant-Man is a superhero who's rather very small in stature but he packs a powerful punch in the eyes of Marvel fans everywhere. The man inside the Ant suit is a burglar named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who tries to make a better living for himself and he does that by braking into peoples houses. <br/><br/>The basic plot of Ant-Man: Scott Lang is a burglar trying to make a better living by doing burglary he then finds the ant suit and is confused as to why it is there. He then turns into the world's smallest hero specifically the smallest Avenger. That's it of the basic plot. <br/><br/>This film has funny plot lines and really great characters. This film feels less Disney than any other Marvel Cinematic Universe film but I'm not the one to complain about that sort of thing. This movie has the best origin story since Spider-Man (2002) and is way better than the first Marvel installment this year and the post credit scene has a hint into the next big Marvel Cinematic Universe film in 2016. This film also has brilliant special effects and one-of-a-kind action scenes from the tiny insect to human sized. Another reason why this is good (opinion) is because it was made from the same studio as Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). So if you are a Marvel fan then this movie is a must see. You have to watch it till the post credit scene (Right at the very end). 10/10 truly f-Ant-astic."

There's some language, more than I remember in any other Marvel film, so come prepared if you have kids. Not overly vulgar, mainly played for laughs.<br/><br/>We were impressed with the way the filmmakers brought the ant size into play. The movie has a fair pace, so it keeps moving along. Battle scenes are long enough to explain the action without going on forever (as in Man of Steel). <br/><br/>Overall, I am thoroughly glad we went and would happily recommend to anyone who wants a fun ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" feel to their superheroes."
"RforFilm","8","1","6","20 July 2015"," There's nothing wrong with a smaller adventure as Ant-Man fills his small stature with plenty of the Marvel wit
","One movie that was a frequent rewatch in the house was Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The journey of these kids as they tried to make it through their backyard (due to their micro size, it's now an elaborate jungle) and back to the house captured my imagination on what the world can hold depending on your size. As a tall man, I get constant stares from children and any small spaces like airplanes and bathtubs are miserable. Though I like my large stature, I do imagine what being a foot shorter could hold. I might be able to take a bath. I could sit anywhere on an airplane without my knees scrunched up to the folding tray. <br/><br/>Of course, there's a difference between being only five foot six and one inch. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is a technical marvel, but for the most part, I rarely see shrinking stories as that interesting. At leas the Disney movie took an existing environment and created a new world. Other existing stories like The Incredible Shrinking Man and Epic are just the same places in a different size. That doesn't create an interesting atmosphere. Ant Man reimagines the micro world much better then the latter two.<br/><br/>Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd) is a thief whose just been released after serving a jail sentence. He tries to go straight in order to pay child support and see his daughter, but that proves hard as any criminal record would do. He turns to another theft job as tipped off by his best friend Luis (played by Michael Peña). He manages to break into a house and open a safe, but instead of money or valuables, he finds a suit that he initially mistakes for a motorcycle suit. He takes it any way and tries it on, only to discover a button that alters his size.<br/><br/>After a scary introduction to the micro world, he tries to return the suit only to discover that that suit's maker, Hank Pym (played by Michael Douglas) had intended Scott to steel it. He reveals, along with his daughter Hope (played by Evangeline Lily), that they are working to stop a scientist/business man Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll) from developing his own shrinking suit, as the latter intends on selling it to Hydra. Scott works on using the suit to his advantage, which increases his strength in the micro world and allows him to communicate with ants, in order to plan the ultimate heist to stop Cross. <br/><br/>Marvel Studios is continuing its streak of interesting superhero movies, as Ant Man does not disappoint. To make it clear, Ant Man isn't much of a crime-fighting story and sticks to more of a heist scenario (Much how Captain America: Winter Solider was a spy story). That makes for a nice change of pace and allows a darker hero to take hold.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Paul Rudd is likable as Scott Lang. He gets some good jokes about his crimes while reacting to the micro world. He shall be a welcome member to the Avengers. Michael Douglass, Evangeline Lilly, and Michael Peña (he steels the comedic scenes) all add their charm to this more comedic Marvel story. The only character who gets the shaft is Darren Cross as the villain. I liked him on House of Cards and hoped he would bring more depth to this antagonist. Oh well, at least he gets some good ""bad guy"" moments.<br/><br/>The star of the film is the micro world. This is a very experimental looking world that looks both intimidating and fun. It's clearly CGI, but it's really spectacular on the big screen.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight Ant Man helmets out of ten. Though not as epic as Avengers: Age of Ultron or as funny as Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant Man gives us a smaller (no pun intended), different marvel story that I'm open to seeing more of."

","As we enter the last film for Phase 2 for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we are taken on a smaller scale and enter the world of Ant-Man. When first announced, Edgar Wright was to helm it but creative differences took the opportunity for Wright to bring his vision to life. However, Peyton Reed took over and Wright still had writing and executive producing credits and helped make the troubled film entertaining as its source. <br/><br/>Ant-Man introduces Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a former criminal who is recently released from prison and only now wishes for a life free of crime and to be closer to his daughter but his past still manages to affect this life in terms of relationships and work. Looking to be a better figure and support himself, he takes a small heist that ends him in get caught again but gaining the interest of inventor Hank Prym (Michael Douglas in top form) and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly). Prym then offers Lang a chance at redemption when his protégé Daren Cross () is on the verge of inventing and manufacturing a suit that enables size capacity and strength for war purposes, an item that Prym himself has created and kept safe from falling into the wrong hands, thus Lang is offered to wear this and help pull a heist that can stop Cross from enabling danger into not only their lives but the world around them. <br/><br/>Storyline was great with the contributions of Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish and supporting material from Paul Rudd and Adam McKay, the plot features a heist theme that makes the film set to a tone and genre (similar to what The Winter Soldier did, mixing political thriller and the superhero genre together) and packs a lot of humour and slight emotion throughout. The humour is what makes the characters likable, and actor Michael Peña (who plays as an ally to Lang) helps to deliver some of the best moments of the film's comedic side, same with Rudd and Douglas.<br/><br/>In terms of visual effects in the MCU, Ant-Man features topping visuals that make it seem Oscar worthy for consideration. When Ant-Man has the capabilities of being small, what we see on screen is purely visual, imaginative and epic on a big scale, this is possibly a mixture of built sets, CGI and cinematography that make it seem so possible and realistic. The costume designs as well were top notch, with both Ant-Man and Yellowjacket's designs being close to the source material and keeping in tone of the realism of the MCU. At times, the pace of the film reminded me of the first Iron Man film where the origin of the hero was developed and kept character development present.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>+ Casting is great, all the performances from the leading and supporting actors were all spot on and there was strong character development from Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Lilly and a great villain role from Corey Stoll<br/><br/>+ Impressive and epic visual effects, costume design and music score was just right for the film<br/><br/>+ The humour is just there throughout, preventing the film to go down a dark path and keep it fun for younger audiences<br/><br/>+ The post-credit scenes and various MCU easter eggs were just exciting and gave a great glimpse of Phase 3 and what's yet to come <br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>Ant-Man is indeed exciting, funny and unexpectedly doesn't take it self seriously (knowing of the comic's origins) and does top over Age of Ultron in terms of humour. Ignore the critics dishing the hate on this film, it's worth the price of an admission ticket and pure entertainment for families and MCU fans."

","Out of all the Marvel films this was probably the one that intrigued me the most, since I first read of it's development. As a bit of a Marvel nerd/buff/fan I was disappointed Ant Man never made it into first phase of Marvel films, as Hank Pym/Ant Man was one of the original founders, but after seeing this I was glad they took their time.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd & Michael Douglas were a good choice as they appear to work well together on screen, their on screen chemistry was a nice surprise. Rudd managed to provide comic relief but also carry himself during the more serious moments.<br/><br/>It's a shame Edgar Wright wasn't able to complete his vision for this movie, would have been interesting to see judging from what I have read, but Reed was able to bring his own stamp with a approach.<br/><br/>The film itself I felt started off slow but gradually picked up steam for a enjoyable ride. The only fault I have was I felt Corey Stoll/Darren Cross was a bit one dimensional didn't bring across the presence for screen villain compared to Hiddlestone' Loki (we have been spoilt there). But didn't spoil my enjoyment of this movie.<br/><br/>Personally I would have liked to see a Hank Pym & Janet Van Dyne Antman/Wasp movie but I can understand Marvel point that going off Pym's issues in the comic (mental breakdowns, spouse abuse, attempted suicide etc) that he wasn't suitable for a family film. Hopefully judging from the mid credit scene we will get to see Hope take up the Wasp mantle and have a Wasp/Antman partnership in the next movie, or even sooner when we see Paul Rudd in Civil War next year.<br/><br/>Looks like Marvel have another winner on their hands, again like last Summer's Guardians Of The Galaxy, a enjoyable funny movie that doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Excelsior n'uff said!"

","Age of Ultron amazed me much more-so than any other movie had when I saw it in theaters, little did I know Ant-Man would do the same albeit to a much smaller extent and for different reasons. After seeing Ant-Man, it is most definitely within my top 5 Marvel Cinematic Universe films, tied with Winter Soldier at third place. It is a must-see for Marvel fans!<br/><br/>The action is not quite as spectacular as that of many other Marvel films, but the shrinking dynamic that is utilized by both the hero and the villain alike was intriguing, especially when it was taken to a quantum level (known as the Microverse in canon). I would have preferred to see more clear and direct hand-to-hand combat as opposed to Scott punching-out opponents with ease at the miniature level, but the action was overall very pleasing. I would also like to state that the minor appearance of the Falcon was a very welcome addition to this film, which even includes a short fight scene! The final fight was pretty spectacular, even though it lacked what was seen in the Steve vs Bucky scenes in TWS in-terms of hand-to-hand combat, simply due to the fact that the usage of everyday items as weapons and the shrinking-growing concept in battle was done very well. Oh yea, and I really did appreciate the concept of the ants assisting and ordering to Scott.<br/><br/>This was probably the funniest action film that I have ever seen! The little quips and jokes made those in the Avengers films look like something you would see in an episode of Spongebob. Unlike the humor in both Avengers movies, the humor in Ant-Man felt very fluent and seamless, and was remarkably hilarious to go along! My personal favorite scene of the ""funny"" type would definitely have to be the inclusion of the Thomas the Tank Engine toy in the climax, which literally ballooned the previously hand-sized toy into an actual railroad (made even more funny with the fact that Thomas' eyes are still motioning around!).<br/><br/>Other than the action and humor factors, there is not much else to discuss aside from the characters. They were all very humorous and enjoyable, and the villain (Darren Cross) was done very thoroughly, although he was oddly similar to Stane from Ironman back in 2008. That brings me to my next point that the Yellowjacket character itself did not appear until quite literally the third act of the film, which was very disappointing in my eyes, but not sufficient to kill my enjoyment of this film.<br/><br/>I would have to give this movie a solid 8.5-9/10. Definitely see it, especially if you are a Marvel fan!"

","The movie is well made but the target audience shouldn't be over 12.<br/><br/>It's the Marvel universe about winning and deserving your daughters love. A bit between ""Honey I shrunk the kids"" (maybe because of the ants?) with the action-theme blended in. Innocent guards being ""man handed"" are for example explicitly saved before explosions. And are just ""knocked out"" instead of being gunned down.<br/><br/>This also means the characters have a lower level of dialogue and motivations. It also makes the movie less dark and ""intense"" as the other superhero movies tend to do.<br/><br/>The graphics are well done, there is a cadence in the movie that is fluid. Some humor is thrown in while the main idea of the movie is about ""fathers loving their daughters"". It does seem there has been an effort to display the ""stephfather"" as a caring supportive role."

","Marvel Comics created many great superheroes that have graced the screen and become especially big in the 21st Century, but the title character of this next incarnation was not a household name, but this movie certainly looked worth a go, directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love, The Break-Up, Yes Man). Basically well-meaning thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been released from prison, he moves in with his old cellmate Luis (Crash's Michael Peña), he is determined to go straight and get a job to provide child support, this is the only way his ex-wife Maggie (Jurassic World's Judy Greer), now engaged to policeman Paxton (Blue Jasmine's Bobby Cannavale), will allow him to see his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Scott agrees to join Luis and his crew to commit a burglary, he breaks in past security systems and cracks the safe, but he finds only what looks like an old motorcycle suit, but he does take this home. Scott tries on the suit at home, and accidentally presses a switch that causes him to shrink to the size of an insect, Ant-Man, he survives a flush down the drain and onto the streets before returning to normal size, terrified by the experience he returns the suit to the house, but he ends up arrested. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the homeowner, visits the jail and smuggles the Ant-Man shrinking suit into Scott's cell to help him break out, at his home Pym explains that he resigned from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering that they attempted to replicate the suit shrinking technology, Pym's former protégé Darren Cross (Non-Stop's Corey Stoll) is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket. Pym manipulated Scott through Luis into stealing the suit, it was a test, he wants him to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket, Pym's estranged daughter Hope van Dyne (Lost's Evangeline Lilly) has been spying on Cross despite her strained relationship with her father, she helps train Scott to use the technology of the suit, to fight and to control ants. Scott is first sent to steal a device from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson / Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hope shows anger towards Pym about the death of her mother Janet (Hayley Lovitt), he explains that she was The Wasp and disappeared, whilst disabling a Soviet nuclear missile, into a subatomic quantum realm, he warns Scott this could happen if he overrides the suit's safeguards. The Yellowjacket is perfected and Pym is invited to the unveiling, Scott meanwhile, with the swarm of ants, flyers, builders and others, infiltrates the building, sabotages the servers and plants explosives, but Cross traps him, he intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra, led by Mitchell Carson (Martin Donovan), Scott manages to escape, Carson flees, and Scott pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate and the building is destroyed. Ant-Man and Yellowjacket fight until Scott is arrested by Paxton, but Cross holds Cassie hostage to lure him into another fight, but this time Scott shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross's suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, Cross is killed, Scott disappears into the quantum realm, but tampers with the safeguards and manages to reverse the mechanism and return to the real world. In the end Paxton covers for Scott in gratitude to keep him out of prison and allow him to be with his daughter, Pym wonders if his wife is also alive in the quantum realm, Luis tells Scott that Wilson is looking for him, and Pym shows and offers Hope a new prototype Wasp suit. Also starring Wood Harris as Gale, David Dastmalchian as Kurt, Tip ""T.I."" Harris as Dave, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes and Stan Lee as Bartender. Rudd manages to pass off being just-about serious and the leading hero, but leaves room for deadpan quips, Douglas is a good choice for the wise scientist, Lilly gets her time being the feisty scientist's daughter, and Stoll is good at being the nasty villain, the supporting cast members get their good moments too. You almost ignore the fact that you may not have heard of the title character before this film was made, you buy into it fairly quickly, and there's small references back to the Avengers, you can just settle back and enjoy the fantastic special effects that take you into the microscopic world of insects and create fast-paced chase and fight sequences, and there is funny stuff too, all together it is a fun action adventure. Good!"
"dyllon_jeng","7","1","7","20 July 2015"," Fun movie that's good for the sake of entertainment
","This movie was fun to watch. It's not the most original story, it's not the most interesting origin story, the character development was satisfactory, and its overall theme is a pretty common one seen in lots of other movies. Still, I had a good time watching it. It had a clever script that brought multiple instances of humor and gave the film an overall lighter mood than most Marvel movies. And like any Marvel origin movie, it gives viewers some nice action scenes (especially when Ant-Man is working with his team of ants as a tiny man) and an interesting look at how the protagonist transforms into a unique fighter of crime. The cast is fine. Paul Rudd does a good job portraying as Scott/Ant-Man, veteran Michael Douglas does well as the watchful and caring mentor in the story, and Evangeline Lilly fits her role perfectly as a serious, determined, and troubled character. The only flaw in the cast is Corey Stoll as the main villain, who can't really be taken too seriously in the story. Overall, it's not truly groundbreaking in any way, but Ant-Man was surely a blast to watch."

","With exception to The Avengers and the Spiderman movies with Toby Maguire, I'm really not into superhero or comic book movies. It's not that they're bad, but they just don't fulfill what I like going to the movies for - I'd much rather a drama, or a psychological thriller. So, it was with weariness that I approached Ant-Man.<br/><br/>My weariness was misplaced. Ant-Man, with the new Mad Max and Spy, will probably be my favourite film of Summer 2015's blockbuster movies. Why? Quite simply, this movie it too big-hearted and jovial to dislike. The story is typical superhero fare, but it revels in the silliness of it all. Its premise is similarly nuts, but instead of trying to take it all seriously it uses this to its advantage, creating some of the most visually inventive sequences I've seen in a long time at the movies. <br/><br/>Part of what makes it such a refreshing ride is Paul Rudd - the perfect choice to play the titular character. He has a charm and charisma that suits the personality of the character, but still tackles the more dramatic moments sensitively and maturely. His comic timing is also pitch perfect - snappy one-liners that might have seemed cheesy coming from anyone else seem perfectly at home here. Michael Douglas is also on top form, looking like he's having great fun playing a much lighter version of similar characters he's played down through the years.<br/><br/>Most of the praise can probably be attributed to the screenplay, though. Wisely, not too much time is spent giving these characters any deep and meaningful back-stories (they give us just enough to care about the characters) and instead they focus on the snappy humour and some pretty dazzling set-pieces. The best moments come when they combine these two elements - there's a sequence towards the end that manages to be both extremely funny, and visually spectacular (it involves a train, and that's all I'll say). My only small critique of the movie is that several characters are relegated to the sidelines when there were opportunities for them to do more - I'd love to have seen the brilliant Judy Greer given more to do, or more dialogue given to Michael Peña. Maybe next time.<br/><br/>It's hard to judge Ant-Man against the likes of The Avengers, because in almost every way it's a different movie - looser, less serious, and more scaled down (the pun not intended - the action here is far less frantic or high-stakes). What it does amount to though is the best action-comedy of 2015 so far, and if that isn't a ringing recommendation I don't know what is."

"CrisMovieCorner","9","1","8","25 August 2015"," Do Marvel deliver in their smallest movie to date...
","12 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe can Marvel keep up their stellar track record? Lets start off with the cast, when the film was nearing production there was talk of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Paul Rudd being favourites for the lead role of Scott Lang, to me both were laughable ideas for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Boy was I WRONG, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang may be my favourite casting in the entire MCU, he was brilliant be it from dropping the typical Rudd jokes we're used to or actually portraying real emotion when talking about his daughter. Not only was Rudd a brilliant call, I loved the entire cast, Michael Peña was absolutely hilarious, he even rivalled Rudd in his comedic ability, Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket was also another inspired choice I mean everybody in this film was spot on in my opinion. Then we have Douglas and Lilly, who had some a wonderful father and daughter dynamic that just felt so real.<br/><br/>Now we have the visuals even in the modern day of the height of CG it is a bit of a baffling thought to imagine seeing a man running around underground with ants and it to not look stupid. However as ALWAYS ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) delivered some truly stunning visuals. I don't want to pick out specific scenes, because really they all stand out in their brilliance seeing him shift from man size to ant size in the blink of an eye is like something straight from the page of a book. There is also two scenes towards the end of the film I know you guys and girls will love they involve an ant and Thomas The Tank Engine (not that part from the trailer, it's even better). Marvel have done it yet again, delivered some stunning effects as they continue to do.<br/><br/>Onto the story, while it is not going to win awards for originality, the story was very fun I thought. Even though Edgar Wright left the project, you could still feel some of his comedic styling in the film, I'd like to know if Tomas The Tank Engine was his idea, feels like a very silly British approach to humour. While the point of the film is not primarily meant to be a comedy, however having Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Paul Rudd and Adam McKay write the script you should expect a fair few giggles and this doesn't disappoint in that sense. The film is filled with laughs, action, nods to the MCU and even heart strings pulling scenes.<br/><br/>The film touches on some subjects that really hit home for me, which was a nice change of pace for a superhero film. I mean we all want to relate to superheroes in our own way, I just think this felt more relatable the whole Hank and Hope relationship was wonderfully done by Douglas and Lilly, if these types of performances continue I can see an actor/actress getting an Oscar nom for their work on a superhero film. Great times ahead for us ""nerds"" yay! Overall, I absolutely LOVED Ant-Man it's very different from the rest of the MCU but exactly the same in some aspects. I will be straight up, I expected this to be easily the worst in Phase 2, I'd say joint second with Winter Soldier after Age Of Ultron for me and I know I gave Winter Soldier a 10 and this a 9, but I still think they are equally as good as each other if that makes sense? No, it doesn't not even to me, but I stand by it. Plus this gets massive bonus points for a certain reference to a friendly neighbourhood somebody :p. Hard to believe that Marvel have delivered again with a character hardly known outside comic readers, they have kicked ass with both Ant-Man and Guardians, here is to the future of the MCU!"

","Ant-Man Review!<br/><br/>With Ant-Man Marvel Studios solidifies its position as a flexible cinematic universe that has proved its ability to make even the weirdest of weirdos into blockbusting characters. In other words, doing the impossible! <br/><br/>The plot follows Scott Lang as he becomes the Ant-Man with the help of Hank Pym and Hope van Dyke in order to perform a high security heist so that a very controversial tech doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Pretty straight forward right? That's the impressive with Ant-Man; it is very contained in its scale, it never grows into a city wide conflict and it still manages to have incredible action and smart entertainment. I won't spoil anything but there is a crossover with another Marvel storyline that perfectly establishes a comparison between our emerging hero and the titans out there. <br/><br/>So, aside from a slow paced and disjointed start, this movie picks up to leave us laughing and gasping at an incredibly creative heist sequence and climax (especially one climactic sequence that got a big surprise out of me). <br/><br/>From maquettes to a helicopter, the action makes stellar use of the environment by cleverly integrating it into the shrinking down sequences. I never thought a bug could be involved in so much action, and with the implemented camera work and the clever use of focus it is now believable! The Ant-Man thankfully takes part in some damn good action sequences sporting some damn cool superpowers. <br/><br/>And what would the Ant-Man be without his alter ego Scott Lang played by the notorious comedian Paul Rudd? Nuttin'. Nuttin' because Paul Rudd is quite good as the main character. He brings a high level of wit and quickness in humour that few others can match and his charisma helps him handle his role as a protagonist. <br/><br/>Secondary players like Evangeline Lily and Michael Douglas also sell their comic counterparts with believability, especially Douglas whose dramatic and comedic queues work perfectly. Michael Peña is also a standout as the comedic relief, as he gets a lot of jokes right aside from some minor flat ones. <br/><br/>My biggest complaint with the film is the villain who has no real relevance aside from putting on the villainous suit and being really evil with some sheep. The actor fit in well in his scenes but there was just not enough material to work with. He only shows up in some random moments that almost give us the impression that the writers where too focuses on the other characters which turned out awesome. This makes his appearance in the climax very meaningless, as he is just some evil guy jumping around.<br/><br/>Ant-Man sports the ""Guardians of the Galaxy Syndrome"". Characters who are so unimaginable in a movie context get a lot of controversy and in the end it turns out to be a really good time and a really big surprise at the same time. The director change got a lot of hopes down too but Peyton Reed may have been the actual best choice. Though we will always wonder what kind of project Edgar Wright would have pulled out of that creative and Cornetto filled brain of his. <br/><br/>Bug-sized in scale but big laughs and action, Ant-Man is another landmark in blockbuster originality and risk taking and it is getting an 8 out of 10! Oh Marvel, please keep pleasing us with your extravagant universes (and if you might consider it, give us an extended Age of Ultron cut)!"

","Personally, I've had enough of Marvel's trite plots with their static hero's and villain's. I'm indifferent to both DC and Marvel, but the latter can learn a thing or two about film from the former.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is a funny, entertaining and oddly informative. After approximately 15 minutes into the movie, any movie-buff can already conjure up the main plot points and resolutions with surprising accuracy. Like almost all of Marvel's movies, Ant-Man's target audience is children below the age of 15; I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has graduated the 10th grade; however, I would recommend this movie to his 10 year old nephew- he would love everything about it. Now, by no means am I advocating cinematic violence here, all I'm saying is; from observation, I have concluded that Marvel's movies have become a ""playground"" for your kids on the way to the work.<br/><br/>By no means is this a professional blight on Marvel's film career; in-fact, it seems to be very lucrative.

","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: A major upgrade for a minor comic book superhero that is lots of fun.<br/><br/>GRADE: B <br/><br/>The battle between man and those pesky ant invaders rages on, with our species usually triumphant having our vast arsenal of insect sprays at our fingertips and our sheer size to trounce them into smithereens. Size unfortunately does matter over this tiny creatures. Granted they readily outnumber us, work extremely well together (as opposed to us), and have mega-strength in comparison. But to make a superhero out of this ant-heap, as with this latest superhero franchise, Ant-Man, sets itself up with limitless limitations of the powers that be.<br/><br/>Yet the film gingerly sidesteps these disadvantages most enjoyably due to its comedic tone, nice use of CGI, compelling action sequences, and some fine acting from its cast. Plus having Paul Rudd in the title role helps make this movie-going experience more diverting than expected.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is the cleverest of major upgrades to one of Marvel Comic's most minor of superheroes. The film never takes itself so serious, its chief virtue. It does dish out the customary exposition heavy-handedly, in larger than necessary dosage in order to try to explain the science behind the superman. The interconnection with that other Marvel Comic's Avenger gang of crusaders becomes weary and unnecessary as this film would do better to stand alone. But the script by committee wisely takes its time to develop its characters and their relationships between all the chases, explosions, and plotting. (Three writers, Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Mr. Rudd himself are credited with the screenplay.)<br/><br/>The cast makes the film work so efficiently. Mr. Rudd is totally appealing as Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man, a petty thief who wants to leave his criminal past behind him. This actor uses his oddball charm and high likability factor to immediately pulls us onto his side as he learns the ups and downs of becoming a superhero. Michael Douglas plays Dr. Hank Pym, his mentor and scientific mastermind behind this great shrinking man plan and he is convincing in his role. Evangeline Lilly is Hope, his estranged daughter and Scott's romantic conquest and the actress has a strong screen presence and great chemistry with Rudd. Our evil villain and disgruntled former protégé of Pym, is Darren Cross, a.k.a. Yelllowjacket, who, of course, is interested in wealth and world domination. This role is wonderfully played by Corey Stoll with just the right crazed menace. Michael Pena adds the comic relief as Scott's loyal and dopey sidekick. Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, John Slattery, and Martin Donovan round out the cast in smaller parts. <br/><br/>Ant-Man's sharp contrast with the real and miniature world is captivates and the film's spirited playfulness within this comic book genre is refreshing. It is never more spot-on than in its climactic action scene between our hero and the film's arch villain, Yellowjacket, set aboard a speeding Fisher-Price Thomas the Train that is priceless fun.<br/><br/>Solidly directed by Peyton Reed, Ant-Man follows its true-and-true formula with a resourcefulness that will certainly pave the way for another sequel. There is lots to admire about these pismires and their human leader and Ant-Man proves itself to be worthy of more than a little respect indeed.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","After being forced out from his company by his former assistant Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a thief who has just been released from prison. Thanks to the training of Pym and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lily), Scott becomes Ant-Man. To be Ant-man. Scott is given a suit that allows him to shrink his size and grow back, possess superhuman strength and the ability to control different types of ants. He uses it and his merry team of misfits to prevent Cross from performing the same technology, found within his Yellowjacket suit, and using it as a weapon for evil.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice about this film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. No one follows this more than Paul Rudd in his performance as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He comes off as likable and his smartly uses his comedic background at the appropriate times. The trio of him along with Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lily work well together and the chemistry which these three have made their scenes very enjoyable. The story, albeit predictable, comes secondary to the performances which are excellent across the board, especially that of Michael Pena's scene-stealing comedic performance as Scott's friend Luis. Corey Stoll did well with what little he had as Cross who's underdeveloped character who does not appear too threatening as the film's main villain. These shortcomings are quickly forgotten when we bear witness to the film's amazing visual effects. The many transitions from big to small were done well and effectively created each feeling by playing with perspectives and proportions. For those concerned about this film's connection to the overall MCU, there are plenty of references to films new and old to keep even the die-hard fans engaged. I was able to catch a few and I am sure there are more that I missed. Of course there are scenes in the middle of the credits and at the end that will offer some reveals to the future of the MCU that I will obviously not spoil but you probably already knew that. The film's biggest action scene, as shown in the trailers, is the best part of the film as it cleverly juxtaposes the characters and their respective sizes with the world around them with the camera smartly zooming in and out as the characters are constantly changing sizes. The film does start off a little slowly compared to other Marvel films but the choice to introduce and flesh-out all of the characters which made me care for them more. Instead of throwing in gratuitous explosions and the like some action films do, the film logically builds up its action sequences making them feel more memorable. In terms of other MCU phase 2 films, this one has to be the funniest one and the funniest MCU film overall since the first Avengers film. To me, this debut film for Ant-Man is the second best debut film (behind the first Iron Man and slightly better than the first Captain America). Knowing what I know now, I can't wait for Captain America: Civil War.<br/><br/>keithlovesmovies.com"

","So the final film of Phase 2 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is Ant-Man; as some of you may know this film has been in production a long time and has had various troubles behind the scenes but how did it end up? Well for starters, the cast is brilliant; Paul Rudd is perfect as this everyman kinda guy who also is a bit of cat burglar, he has some great comedic lines and has good chemistry with the rest of the cast. Michael Douglas is an awesome Hank Pym, he does the dramatic moments excellently and even pulls off a few jokes too. All the other cast were great as well but I do have to mention Michael Peña, he delivers some of the best lines in the movie and is an all- round entertaining character.<br/><br/>Next I'll come to the story. Much like the superhero himself, this plot is scaled down tremendously compared to the other films of the MCU. He's not unearthing a huge government conspiracy, he's not guarding the galaxy and he doesn't have to deal with an apocalyptic A.I. robot; Ant-Man is a heist movie which takes almost a civilian view of the rest of the world, and that's what makes this movie stand out I think. Of course you get references to the Avengers but this really does feel like a small event we're looking into, like a side mission in a game, and I enjoyed that.<br/><br/>Being a Marvel movie the special effects would of course be top notch but Ant-Man goes beyond and has some really breathtaking visuals, the shrinking/growing effect is awesome and the shots of Ant-Man when he's small are so photo-realistic because they blur out all the background and it really does look you've entered this tiny world. The action sequences were pretty impressive as well, some of the best in the franchise, because of his powers they used some very clever ideas to make it very entertaining.<br/><br/>Now for some of the negatives of the film. Mostly the first half; there were some clunky exposition scenes and it just seemed to go really slow in parts; of course they need to explain a lot to new audiences but for some, if you're not that interested or you already know it all then I've heard people call it boring. I for one wasn't bored at all but I did feel the need for the pace to get going a bit. Another negative was the villain; Yellowjacket was fine, he was awesome, menacing and cool to watch but the character controlling it, Darren Cross came across as bit cliché at times and just wasn't generally threatening as a person.<br/><br/>In the end Ant-Man was very funny, very clever and one of the most unique films of the franchise. Be sure to smile at the obligatory Stan Lee cameo and stay through the credits all the way to the end."

Until he realizes it may be the only way he'll get to be with his young daughter Cassie(Ryder Fortson, cute). He ends up in the suit of Ant-Man, a superhero mantle that he is to take up now that the original inventor of it, Pym(Douglas, a mentor albeit angry), who's become something of a recluse, watching the world through a dozen monitors rather than interacting with it. His daughter Hope(Lilly, a strong female character who gets to kick ass) is trusted by Cross(Stoll, also a brilliant scientist, though one without ethics), who they have to steal the tech from, so it isn't spread to the world - as it would end up in the wrong hands, and make for an almost unstoppable force. The three plan a heist, and have to work together, in spite of strained relations between them.<br/><br/>Like Guardians of the Galaxy, this is a far-out concept, which is blessed with an adaptation that embraces that, rather than shying away from it. It took Edgar Wright to get it off the ground, and his departure left a substantial void which Peyton Reed, as game as he is, couldn't fill. What could have been is all over this one. The ending is pure cheese. Like the other origin pictures, which this is one of the best of, there's not much in the way of a villain. Heck, even doing good is limited here. What we do have is essentially one long training montage, punctuated with stunning shrinking scenes that make the 3D worth the extra bucks, and a few solidly planned and executed break-ins. The action is creative, memorable and fun. Dialog is improvised and hilarious, with charm, great interplay and an energized cast.<br/><br/>There is a little strong language and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone persuaded by the cool trailers, which did not give too much away. 8/10"
"Foal24","8","1","8","22 July 2015"," The little super hero movie that could
","If ever there was a movie in the hugely successful Marvel Studio's film franchise doomed to failure it had to be Ant-man. It had everything up against it. I mean, come one!! A Super Hero who shrinks??!! In a world where bigger is better, where size matters, where strength prevails, a hero whose only ability is he can be little??!!<br/><br/>Surely, considering that no one but the absolute geekiest of comic book geeks have heard of this character, Marvel have over-reached this time!! <br/><br/>Surely, considering the fact that Edgar Wright, who wrote the screen play, and was due to direct it, left the project shortly before filming began, it had to fail. Surly, given all that, this had to be Marvel's first stinker!!<br/><br/>No. The franchise which can seemingly do no wrong has got it right again.<br/><br/>The thing about Ant-man is it's just so much fun. The laughs come thick and fast, from go to woah. Paul Rudd is as likable as ever as Scott Lang, the electrical engineer turned corporate burglar who stole from his greedy corporate bosses to repay the consumers they had fleeced for years. <br/><br/>Rudd is well supported by Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, the genius inventor of the Pym Particle and the original Ant-man, who sees more than a little of his younger self in Lang, just as he happens to be looking for a candidate to take over his legacy, since he retired from saving the world back in the 80's.<br/><br/>The always lovely Evangeline Lilly is, well, lovely. I loved her when she was lost on that TV show where all the plane crash survivors were lost together on an island (I think it was called 'Sexy Plane Crash survivors try to stay alive'). I loved her when she donned the pointy ears to play a butt-kicking elf goddess in the hobbit. And, I love her in this as the formerly estranged daughter of Hank Pym. She is fantastic as the corporate heavyweight with a keen interest in martial arts. The montage of her training Rudd's hapless character in the finer arts of hand to hand combat is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>This is a movie, like Guardians of the Galaxy before it, which contains the perfect mix of comedy, action and dazzling special effects. The action scenes of Rudd cruising about with his little six-legged buddies look absolutely amazing. <br/><br/>If you're after a movie where you can kick back, not think too much, and just enjoy yourself this is the one for you.<br/><br/>This is the most unlikely hit movie ever, but it really works. It's the little super film that could."
"captainmike-michael","8","1","8","22 July 2015"," Smaller Scale but Promising
","It's always challenging to introduce new character especially being the final one in Phase II after so many Avengers assembled but Marvel has done it perfectly well in presenting this tiny superhero. The editing is slightly affected by two obvious jump scenes in the beginning of the film and the emotional engagement of the characters is slightly rushing but given the limited 2 hours running time, the progression of the plot is rather fine linking to MCU by covering the background, science, encounter, relationship between characters and mission to fight the villain. Paul Rudd leads a charming performance as Antman, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly also offer some surprise as supporting casts while Corey Stoll as the antagonist is a bit underdeveloped. The CGI and action sequences are at a smaller scale, the shrinking cinematography is outstanding together with scores composed by Christophe Beck but being a less darker superhero film, Marvel has once again delivered successfully."
"schroeder-gustavo","9","1","8","21 July 2015"," Fun, Exciting, but most of all...surprising
","Ant-Man is a movie that really surprised me. Not that I wasn't expecting the great and charismatic performances by Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas, I did, but I really wasn't expecting being entertained as much as this movie entertained me.<br/><br/>It has all the best ingredients to make a great Marvel film, since it combines light comedy and action almost perfectly. Let's talk about the comedy: this movie made me laugh, it made me laugh hard. This is by far the funniest movie I have seen this year and that deserves recognition. Paul Rudd nails it as Ant-Man and Michael Douglas is cast perfectly as Hank Pym. Also, great job by Evangeline Lilly and Michael Peña as well.<br/><br/>One or two things I didn't like so much about the movie is that the CGI isn't always as good as I though it should have been, cause there are parts in the movie that you can tell it's CGI and that's not a great sign. But it's a very small flaw that I can ignore. Also, the balance in the movie between comedy and seriousness isn't always perfect, because at times it just feels like you're watching a different movie.<br/><br/>These are just small flaws to the movie and overall Ant-Man is just a great standalone Marvel movie. It has great action, awesome performances, it's funny as hell, but most of all, it's a surprising movie, showing us an enthralling origin story about a superhero that not a lot people cared about. This movie will probably change their minds about Ant-Man. Did I mention it also fits in perfectly into the Marvel Cinematic Universe? It does."
"mcgregorrowland","8","1","8","20 July 2015"," A little slow at first but keeps getting better and better as each minute goes by
","MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>The Marvel universe has been doing a lot lately. From Guardians of the Galaxy to the Avengers, it has been a hell of a ride. And now they give us Ant-Man, an action- comedy superhero film that fires on all cylinders. I'm a huge Marvel fan and this movie was perfect for me regarding the development of a new hero and it's connection to the other heroes in the Marvel universe. (Note: If you loved Guardians of the Galaxy then you will absolutely love this because of it's humor and action).<br/><br/>OK, so first off, this movies starts off a little slow so don't get impatient when you are watching this. But even the slow start is great character development and it also gives you the background of the Ant-Man suit and how to use it, control it, talk to ants, etc. So, in my opinion, the slow start was worth the view while waiting for the awesome action to come.<br/><br/>Speaking of action, this movie had some mind blowing action sequences and CGI. It was classic Marvel and it put a smile to your face.<br/><br/>The plot was great and a very creative idea to introduce the Ant-Man into the Marvel universe. Also the plot was not your traditional Marvel plot so it was nice to have a different plot than a big bad guy taking over the world with his army.<br/><br/>The acting was spectacular. Paul Rudd, Michael Pena, and T.I. put great comedy into this film just like every Marvel film should have. Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly also did great.<br/><br/>So even though this did start off slow, that did not stop this film from being great. If you love Marvel and Guardians of the Galaxy then you will love this creative film that fits in great with the Marvel universe."
"letthemagicmoveyou","8","1","8","20 July 2015"," Ant-Man: ""It's great. Not Iron Man great, but great.""
","We've seen some ""meh"" films in the MCU. For instance, Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World. Ant-Man is not this. It's very refreshing, with the addition of new character abilities and new possibilities, rather than your Captain America-like punching powers. Ant-Man has punching powers too, but the movie features Scott Lang (Ant-Man) shrinking and growing mid-fight, and using ants to fight. It's also primarily a heist movie, with a Falcon cameo which felt well-placed, and it's easy to jump into if you aren't familiar with the character or previous MCU films. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd makes for a great Scott Lang, and he plays the role with a great balance of comedy and drama. My only problem is that I kept calling him Paul Rudd instead of Scott Lang when I saw him on screen, but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas's Hank Pym was also extremely well-done. The movie portrays him as a mentor and father- figure to Scott Lang but he's also a pretty tortured soul, which makes for good screen time with him and a good tie-in to the comics. His daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), is well-cast and she plays her role well, and she shares great moments with Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd.<br/><br/>On the downside, Darren Cross/Yellowjacket as portrayed by Corey Stroll seems to go crazy and murderous very quickly and for no reason. Michael Douglas mentions that he wasn't very stable to begin with at one point, but he wasn't that fleshed out to make me believe it very much. I'm on board with it, for sure, though. I read a review on the way in and I expected worse, so it was above expectations. <br/><br/>You may have heard that Ant-Man wasn't anything special or it was good, but not great, and I totally disagree. It was a refreshing story with new characters that we'll come to love in this film and in later installments to the MCU (at least, I will). If I haven't swayed you, I advise you see the movie for yourself and end up surprised."
"paul-3991","10","1","8","19 July 2015"," Best movie we have seen in a long time!
","We (My wife & I and 2 friends) just got back from seeing Ant-man and we all were pleasantly surprised! Or should I say extremely surprised! None of us expected it to be much, but WOW, were we surprised! We saw this movie in 3D and it was FANTASTIC! We even plan on seeing it again, something we seldom ever do! Especially my wife, and she is really talking about going again! The storyline built up and developed the characters really well and the movie had a better balance than the normal non-stop fighting and action...action...action that recent ""comix"" movies have given us lately. It also had a really nice balance of humor, thanks to a really effective cast & great writing. Casting was extremely well done, as Douglas, Rudd & the other cast members were perfect matches for their parts. Again, the 3D really did a great job in bringing the Ant-man story to life. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this movie & suggest seeing it in 3D, even if you aren't a fan of 3D. It REALLY added to the ""Ant-man effects "", bringing a realism to what he went thru. I hope they release it in 3D for home use, as it is worth having in a home collection. It is one of the better 3D movies I have seen, and one of the better ""comix"" movies produced. <br/><br/>GO see it....and be sure to watch it ALL THE WAY to the VERY END! (Couple Easter eggs!) <br/><br/>Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
"skoobydoo6789","10","1","8","19 July 2015"," Fun heist/superhero movie
","Ant-Man has been in movie limbo for years. Originally, Edgar Wright was going to this movie, but left due to various issues. So I'm glad it was worth the wait. The movie was amazing. Ant-Man is a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The movie is about Scott Lang, an ex-con trying to do right by his daughter. When he couldn't hold down a job, he turns back to crime. This brings Scott to Hank Pym's attention. Pym wants Scott to become Ant-Man to stop his inventions from getting out into the world.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is an amazing movie. It has a great cast, story, humor, and special effects. The main leads (Scott, Hope, and Hank) work well together. The humor was on point and didn't become annoying like in Thor: The Dark World. The special effects were the best part of the movie. It was amazing seeing the world from the perspective of an ant. The effects look great in IMAX 3-D. Ant-Man is definitely worth seeing. It's a great entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"clerdonna","9","1","8","18 July 2015"," ""Are you not ENTERTAINED?""
","The answer to that infamous question after I watched Marvel's ""AntMan"" is YES YES YES. I am a Marvel junkie, I admit, but even I was suspicious when I first heard the news of AntMan coming out. But being the junkie I am, and knowing I would need a Marvel fix after Age of Ultron, I went open minded and I am VERY happy that I did. AntMan was such a joy to watch-from the quirky humor to Paul Rudd who portrays Scott Lang's offbeat yet hilarious character quite well (mind you, I also had doubts of Paul Rudd's ability to perform as Scott Lang/AntMan so he, too, impressed me.) Furthermore, it's important to appreciate the little-big things of this film, like how they made this movie so epic despite the size our protagonist was fighting in. The effects made you REALLY involved, whether from Scott's perspective, or from an onlooker looking onto Scott's small form. Overall, AntMan truly is a joy to watch-great action, great humor. Is it Avengers level? Of COURSE NOT because quite frankly, nothing ever is or will be Avengers level in the MCU, so it's not fair to compare individual films to such an impractical goal. Still, AntMan was worth the trip, and made me smile the entire 2 hours in the theater and all the way home. Hopefully you'll agree once you see for yourself ;)"
"Bravesfan17","9","1","8","18 July 2015"," A Fun New Addition to the MCU
","Anyone who knows me knows that I highly enjoy Marvel films, and sing their praises. Since the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the first Iron Man in 2008, Marvel has made a hit with me every time. I've enjoyed all eleven installments Marvel has put out, and Ant-Man makes it twelve. <br/><br/>The story begins in 1989, where Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has quit SHIELD after he finds out that they tried to replicate his shrinking technology. He has been trying to hide it away from everyone ever since. Cut to present day San Francisco, where infamous burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is getting out of prison and moves in to an apartment with his former cell-mate, Luis (Michael Peña). Scott wants to see his daughter Cassie, but his ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her fiancé Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) won't let him visit until he can pay child support. He can't hold a job due to his criminal record. To rectify, Luis tells Scott of a job he can pull off. Scott is reluctant because of his desire to stop stealing. He takes the job, which involves stealing from the safe of an old man who is not home, only to find a suit and helmet. As he dons the suit and finds out what it does, he hears a voice as he is being tested right away. Hank is the voice Scott hears. When Scott tries to return the suit, he is arrested and thrown in jail, but his ""lawyer"" Hank recruits him to be the new Ant-Man. Scott accepts the job and is needed to stop Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), a former protégé of Hank's who has replicated his shrinking technology and wants to use it for his own personal gain. <br/><br/>I was always interested in this project since the announcement that Edgar Wright, director of comedies such as Hot Fuzz and The World's End, was going to direct. I became more interested when reading of the preproduction issues such as Marvel seeing the film one way with Wright seeing it a different way. Peyton Reed, who has directed films such as Bring It On and The Break-Up, stepped in and showed that he can not just do things how Marvel wants it done, but be able to add to it. Reed did a very nice job of mixing the action and comedy, and also combing a comedy film with a heist film. Wright and co-writer Joe Cornish had some nice ideas with the script. With Adam McKay coming on to fix up the script, he knows how to write to Rudd's strengths as an actor. Rudd also did some script polishing with McKay. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd has shown in the past that he can be a lead and carry a movie with roles in I Love You, Man, How Do You Know, and Wanderlust. As Scott Lang, Rudd is at his finest with making a criminal likable and showing that he wants to do good. Michael Douglas is just spectacular and elevates the role of the mentor to Scott to someone who is also haunted by his past. Michael Peña is a riot as Scott's best friend. He hilarious with when he tells Scott about the job and again when someone wants to find out about him. Corey Stoll also has some moments as Darren Cross. Everyone else goes from serviceable to decent. <br/><br/>The technical achievements are also great. I liked the use of the 1.85: 1 aspect ratio as I felt closer to the action. I thought the visual effects were spectacular, especially the scenes where Scott is ant sized and adapting to being that size. I also like the visuals when Scott is fighting Darren in Cassie's bedroom. The enlarged ant and the enlarged Thomas the Tank Engine cracked me up. I also liked the editing, especially in the two scenes where Luis is telling his story and the characters involved are talking the same way he is. The sound design was all around brilliant and I liked the use of different sounds. <br/><br/>This is an overall fun addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like Guardians of the Galaxy, this has an overall light tone that makes Marvel feel fresh but be part of the overall universe. I enjoyed the mid credits scene and the end scene makes a nice buildup to the next MCU installment."
"soonerfan0127","10","1","8","18 July 2015"," Minuscule is size, yet large in entertainment.
","When looking at the title for Ant-Man, one would think of this as being a forced comic book adaptation that Marvel is trying to crack open. Boy, would they be wrong, however. Ant-Man reaches audiences of all ages, with its witty dialogue and added elements of comedy. Paul Rudd was the perfect choice for Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He displays a personal effect on many, because he truly cares about his daughter and proves the many layers that his acting ability can show. The rest of the cast was also perfectly cast. There wasn't a single cast member that was miscast. Corey Stoll is the right type of antagonist for this style of movie. Michael Douglas as Dr. Hank Pym added mentor ship in his role, and doesn't disappoint. The supporting cast of Michael Pena and Rapper T.I. make this superhero heist flick even more original and fresh, as they steal the scenes that they are in. Overall, Ant-Man doesn't try too hard to impress, and it shows, as it surpasses the big action sequences of a movie like The Avengers: Age of Ultron. It proves that you don't need all of that, if you have a perfect cast, lined up with a fresh and exciting idea. Marvel's best of the year. Go see it in 3D as well. It'll only enhance the visual experience in this one."
"sujanfaster","9","1","8","17 July 2015"," Perfect break for Paul Rudd
","When Paul Rudd was announced as Antman, I double checked if I was reading it right. With no disrespect to Paul, I never considered him to fit in a big franchise as a leading man. But well, Marvel makes wonders. Instead of bringing a new face for Antman, Peyton Reed brings out a Paul Rudd that we have never seen before. Though the movie is quite independent, there are some connections to The Avengers franchise as well. So you might miss few things if you haven't seen The Avengers or any of other Marvel Universe movies. <br/><br/>Though the script has nothing much to offer, apart from the experiments gone wrong, conflict of evil and good scientists, broke leading character etc, it is the CGI and the camera effects make this movie special. As everyone knows the concept of Antman is very heavily dependent on size and hence the makers have to be very careful about switching the camera angles and the CGI and they have got it just right. As always the tongue in cheek humor of Marvel franchise, is continued here as well. Michael Pena has you in splits. Though Michael Douglas' role is stereotypical, it is adjustable. Evangeline Lilly and Corey Stoll are apt, but it is Paul Rudd who drives this vehicle smoothly. He doesn't try too hard. You almost feel like Paul Rudd has done many roles like this.<br/><br/>Be sure not to miss the Post Credit scenes. I know Marvel fans are not going to miss this movie. If you are not following the Marvel Universe yet, as Nick Fury says ""Its about damn time""."

"CheeseKnees","8","1","9","23 August 2015"," Another successful entry in the MCU
","Ant Man is the latest instalment in the ongoing Marvel Cinematic Universe, of which there are to be 10 more(!) within the next 4 years, and the last in Phase 2, which formally concluded with Age of Ultron. It stars Paul Rudd as a recently released convict who is trying to rebuild his life, get back to work, rekindle old relationships, all that good stuff. However, he struggles with all of these things, and is tempted back to his wicked ways. In the process, he discovers this suit that can shrink him to minuscule size, and, of course, steals it. This brings him to the attention of a scientist, played by Michael Douglas, who reveals that he originally designed said suit, and offers to send Rudd out on a mission to save the world from Douglas' business rival, and reunite Rudd with his family.<br/><br/>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the most ambitious film projects in recent memory, and the fact that a fair chunk of its individual entries have been well received is a testimony to the ambition and though that goes into them. However, it is starting to approach two obstacles; the over-saturation of superhero flicks in the multiplex's schedule, and the continually changing tastes of moviegoers.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Ant Man changes gears by going for a more humorous tone, whilst retaining much of the fast, fun action bravado seen in The Avengers. A lot of these jokes did get a chuckle out of me, especially a string of gags in the climax involving a Thomas train set (one of which has been flaunted EVERYWHERE in the advertising. Thanks for keeping the surprise, Disney.)<br/><br/>The visual effects employed to display the suit's microscopic capabilities are brimming with imagination, and suck you into the trials and tribulations of Rudd as he navigates through shoes, toys and, of course, ants. Yeah, it's mostly CGI, and admittedly it does look kind of fake at points, but it works because I don't think it has been used this way successfully before.<br/><br/>The two main characters as described above are far and away the best characters in the movie. Their contrasting personalities, with Rudd as the good natured rebel and Douglas as the brilliant but seasoned scientist, provides a dynamic between them that carries much of the movie in between the smacking and the punching. Both of these characters are fully fleshed out, and we learn about their motivations and desires as the story unravels.<br/><br/>What about the other characters? They're okay. There are these three other borderline ethnic stereotypes that share an apartment with Rudd, and the Latino guy does provide a sizable portion of the feature's guffaws. Evangeline Lily plays this woman who I don't really remember, and then there is also the villain, the business rival I mentioned earlier. He has patented the Yellowjacket, which has similarities to the Ant Man costume, such as the ability to downsize its bearer. If the MCU had an Achilles heel, it would be its portrayal of antagonists. Although Yellowjacket is not the weakest villain to come out of Marvel Studios (I'm looking at you, 9th Doctor blue-elf-thingy from Thor 2!), as he does come across as threatening at the very least, we don't we get why he wants to destroy much of humanity, apart from a petty spat between him and his old boss.<br/><br/>Oh well, that is just one rogue ant in a colony of fully functional ones, and Ant Man is still a huge (or should that be small) thrill ride to sit through, both on its own, and intertwined with the likes of Iron Man and Captain America."

","while from my perspective this is the weakest offering in the avenger's franchise, with uneven storytelling, paul rudd is still the most adorable man on the planet alive today and it's worth watching for him alone. plus, since (if i am correctly informed) ant-man is going to be in the next avengers movie, it's worth watching just to stay on the storyline. the performances are good, something in the script or directing is just not up to snuff.<br/><br/>not a comics reader, but the avengers movie lineup is probably my favorite story arc of all time.<br/><br/>captain America #1 was better, but was still considered one of the weaker films until winter soldier came out. i would give this one a chance. and i still think it's way better than thor #2."

","Forced out of his own company by former student and protégé Darren Cross, Dr. Hank Pym recruits the talents of Scott Lang, a master thief just released from prison. <br/><br/>With intense training and his engineering skills, Lang becomes Ant-Man, trained by Pym and armed with a suit that allows him to shrink in size, possess superhuman strength and control an army of ants. <br/><br/>The hero must use his new skills to prevent Cross, also known as Yellowjacket, from perfecting the same technology and using it as a weapon for evil......<br/><br/>This is easily the most risky Marvel mainstream movie to date, many could say GOTG, but it had such a bonkers synopsis and narrative that it could only be the success that it was.<br/><br/>I don't know if its because Age Of Ultron was beyond underwhelming for me, but I found Ant-Man to be one of the most refreshing, funniest, and character driven superhero movies that's not a sequel I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>And it's the most family friendly movie Marvel has made to date. Rudd is brilliant as Lang, and the most human of all the phases characters. He has no special powers, and doesn't have the resources like Stark. He just has his intelligence and cunning, and he's the marvel character you can release to the most. Why? Because he's a normal person just trying to be a better man.<br/><br/>But as good as Rudd is, it's Douglas who steals the film, and his scenes with Stoll are the most intense and satisfying moments in the film. Douglas shows us in this film what an intense screen presence he can be, and like Costner in Man Of Steel, it's been a while since he's shone in a movie.<br/><br/>It takes a while for the film to get going, in fact, the first twenty minutes feel really out of place compared to the rest of the film, and Pena really doesn't do any favours for the film, he almost makes the film become spoof like. I'm guessing that Wright didn't have much to do with that characters arc.<br/><br/>But going back to Wright, there is some wonderful, genuinely laugh out loud moments that has the auteurs mark all over it. The training montages are as funny as they are exciting, and there is one part that involves an enlarged garden gnome that had me in fits of laughter for minutes.<br/><br/>The way the humour is handled only makes the action scenes more enjoyable, and Stolls character seem more unhinged than he his, even though he doesn't seem it, he's one of the more formidable marvel villains of recent times.<br/><br/>The film is never going to be as big as Iron Man or Cap, but it ends phase 2 on a high, and it's the most exciting standalone hero movie released since Thor.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's a fun addition to an already wonderful multi-franchise, but it's maybe too family friendly for some, and it goes way over the top bonkers in the final set piece. <br/><br/>But it's all about the bonkers, and it relishes in the bizarre-ness of the narrative.<br/><br/>Well done Marvel."
"jpkwolf","9","1","9","30 July 2015"," Ant-Man is highly enjoyable and a lot of fun
","Top-3 tier for Marvel? I'd say so. Your enjoyment will depend on how much you enjoy epic ensemble action or feel good superhero action with lots of comedy and some feels. So are you more Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy kind of guy? If you say GOTG then I think you'll enjoy Ant- Man.<br/><br/>The movie is very well balanced structure wise and you can feel Edgar Wrights touch in this although he left the project. Corey Stoll is great as the villain and the rest of the cast is great too. <br/><br/>Highly recommended, then again I don't think Marvels own studios have made a bad movie (Except few mediocre ones like The Incredible Hulk and the first Captain America movie) and this is another very enjoyable film."
"robsta23","8","1","9","30 July 2015"," Actually Very Funny
","This isn't one of the best Marvel origin stories out there, but I was unexpectedly very entertained by this movie. If there is anything that has been consistent in this Marvel universe (at least from what I've seen, haven't seen The Incredible Hulk) it's a great comedic tone to lighten things up.<br/><br/>To me, at least, the basic premise of a superhero whose power is to shrink but maintain human strength is a little boring to me. What wasn't boring once I actually decided to give it a chance was the training Paul Rudd's character had to go through to master the capabilities of the suit he is given by his ""mentor,"" played by Michael Douglas. It is amusing to see Paul Rudd repeatedly fail to jump through a keyhole; it is a simple moment in the movie that we can relate to since we all make mistakes and need to try things again from a different approach. It is also relieving to see him terrified of ants at that size because I would hate that.<br/><br/>The movie is almost self-aware that it is a Marvel movie, bringing in elements of the Marvel universe for jokes. At one point, the titular Ant-Man suggests to call the Avengers to do Douglas' work to which his response is basically ""I don't want them knowing about this."" Let's be honest, they could have done better than this. And we actually see Ant-Man fight a to-be-Avenger which is a funny scene, but they don't really explain why nobody is training at their facility that day except for Falcon.<br/><br/>Most of the humor comes from Rudd's character blowing things up in size during a fight towards the film's conclusion, but my favorite part of this movie has to be Michael Pena's character. He over- explains things and is excited when he does so, and this reminds me of a particular family member of mine, so I found it very amusing.<br/><br/>The story itself is just okay which is why I only consider this movie to be a decent Marvel movie, probably somewhere in the middle of the list if I were to rank the Marvel movies I have seen. Essentially an apprentice of Douglas wants to use the technology for the shrinking suit as a weapon to be produced for the military's use, so essentially we have a want-to-be arms dealer trying to make a profit from the Douglas character's idea.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly not up to par with the Avengers movies, but you should see it if you want to experience one of the funnier Marvel movies."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","9","1","9","29 July 2015"," Marvel Has done it Again This was a Cool movie.
","I thought Ant Man was a good Film I thought the performances from everyone were good and I liked the story and the Action.The Story was Low Key but I thought it worked,a Low Key story is Not always a bad thing,The Film also has a Heart. Paul Rudd was great as the Ant man he fit the character perfectly and the guy was very Funny he made me laugh so many times and I really Liked him in this film he plays a cool and likable Character and I was always on his side right from the start. I have to admit Ant man is probably the Funniest Marvel Film I've seen,This movie has the Best Humour in the series in my opinion. I found the story interesting and Ant mans suit was Awesome I especially loved when he shrunk in size then got bigger and beat up all the bad guys I thought that was a lot of fun to watch. The Film also has good special effects and good Visuals and I thought the directing and writing were good.<br/><br/>Now getting to the Main Bad Guy Yellow-Jacket I personally thought he was kind of generic,his motives were typical and clichéd Nothing you've never seen before,and he was never scary or that threatening to be honest,at best I thought he was just Alright.He put up an okay fight against Ant man but the guy was nothing too special in my opinion I also found him too Ridiculous and over the Top to be scary. There are Stronger Villains than him Like Loki and Ultron for example. That is just my opinion though.<br/><br/>The Cast of the film was good Evangeline Lilly looked beautiful in this movie and she was a likable Character I liked her and never had a problem with her she plays the role of Michael Douglases Daughter and she played it well and I also liked that she was tough when she needed to be she was No push over that's for sure. Another thing that this film did well was build characters. I personally thought there was good character development of Ant man and Michael Douglases character and Evangeline Lilly's Character,you knew stuff about them and they were good people and they Helped Ant Man and became his friends so as a result you Liked them,or I Did at least. I also Liked the relationship between Paul Rudd and his family I thought it was nice.<br/><br/>I should also point out the film is Funny and its meant to be Funny you could tell the characters were not taking things 100% serious and that was the point and I do think the people that hate the Film did not understand that,they definitely Missed the point of the movie. If your expecting a super serious film you will be disappointed because this Film is Never totally serious its more of A Fun Popcorn Flick and that's what I liked about it. Michael Pena was Hilarious in the movie his Lines were funny as hell,he also Helps Ant man fight some bad guys.I thought the supporting cast were pretty descent they did what they had to do and were fine.<br/><br/>The Film has a bit of a slow start but they did that to build up characters so it didn't bother me that much,also the Film is not full of Action but that didn't bother me either and that's because I liked most of the characters they were funny entertaining likable characters so they made up for the lack of action.I must also Point out when the Action happens its Good and very Thrilling. I thought the fight scene between Ant man and Falcon was pretty good I also liked the Ending fight against the Main bad guy. I thought the suits that both characters had were pretty cool and I liked the powers the suits had.I also liked how the Film ended.Overall I Think the people that made fun of this Film don't know what their talking about,The Ant man was a cool character and a brave character and I thought He kicked Ass and he even Gave Yellow Jacket a run for his money. Don't listen to the negative Reviews Just go and Watch the movie it's very Entertaining and I Liked It a Lot."

","An Ant Man movie has finally arrived and was worth the wait. Ant Man is fresh, funny and above all entertaining. <br/><br/>Rudd was a great choice for the role of the ant sized hero, making Scott Lang funny as well as a likable hero that we're all rooting for. Michael Pena was hilarious in his role as Luis, who brought a sense of comedy like no other marvel movie I've seen to date.<br/><br/>The visual effects are impressive and the fight scenes are brilliantly done.

","I have seen all the MCU movies to date and Ant-Man is an excellent addition to that collection. When hearing of Ant-Man first and the fact that Paul Rudd was starring in it, I wasn't sure what to think of it. Now I can gladly say that i loved it!<br/><br/>Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lily and Michael Douglas all gave great performances, and Michael Pena was often funny. Also, one of the best things about this movie was the humor, I was laughing my ass off at times. The action was good and I just really liked seeing the environment when Ant- man shrunk, kinda seeing the world from that point of view. The storyline worked well for me and the MCU tie-ins were awesome. It was such a refreshing movie to see and I don't really have anything negative to say.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie I would recommend seeing if you're looking for action, story and fun!"
"marcusodonnell","8","1","9","25 July 2015"," Ant-Man - Marvels smallest hero for all to see
","Ant-Man<br/><br/>Please note there are some spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>This is part of Marvel's phase two of films. It introduces, as the name suggests, a man who becomes ... well not an ant at least. Ant-Man is a different sort of hero in this movie. Again taken from the comic books the movie opens in the late 80s with before Avengers and Age of Ultron. Hank Pym, the creator of a drug discovers people want to be less careful than he. Deciding the only way is to quit, he attempts to hide his formula and suit from the world.<br/><br/>Moving forward in time to present day and a discovery that all is not well. Pym is shown work that presents him with a problem. He turns to a man apparently out of luck, a convicted cat-burglar Scott Lang who himself tried to do what he thought was right. Between the two, along with a few others, they attempt to right the wrong.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is one of Marvels older characters first appearing in Tales to Astonish #27 (January 1962). Hank Pym was the first Ant-Man who became a founder member of the Avengers. The title and all that went with it was handed down to others including Scott Lang, when Pym moved to take up other roles. I won't go into everything but safe to say the character has history.<br/><br/>The 2015 feature film cleverly condenses the history of Ant-Man, Hank Pym, Scott Lang and places it neatly into the current Marvel film universe. Now this is slightly different to the comic universe, which is to be expected. For me the film falls between the feel of the Avengers and the wit and comic effects of Guardians of the Galaxy. The action moves the film along at what is now the accustomed Marvel pace, with hints of other movies, other characters and its own style. The actors are very believable, again well-chosen by Marvel which just adds that extra little something. It has pace, well scripted and a good sound track. All-in-all , the Marvellous package.<br/><br/>Ant-Man may not out gross Avengers 2 or Galaxy but it will keep Marvel on track. There is certainly much more in the pipeline. In fact within a few weeks the reboot of the Fantastic Four will hit the screen and then Civil War breaks out. Add to this Doc Strange, X-Men Apocalypse and others, Marvel is still head and shoulders above their rival. At the moment, there seems no stopping this expanding universe.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10<br/><br/>Tagline: ""The smallest hero with a big ego.""<br/><br/>http://drawnonwords.co.uk/ant-man/"
"gysrules","9","1","9","25 July 2015"," Big Things in Small Packages ! 9.2/10
","Wow! What a huge surprise this film was! The concept of Earth's mightiest,tiniest hero has been in development for nearly a decade. Edgar Wright was originally at the helm to bring an underrated hero to life. However, after creative differences led to a falling out, wright left the project, leaving behind a feeling of worry and doubt for optimistic comic book fanatics. However, this film surprises in many aspects from the comedic range to the almost meta-type humor the film invigorates on itself. The action sequences were exciting and fun, as well as performances by Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas, who steals the show throughout the majority of this film. What a pleasant surprise ant man was."
"ronm07","9","1","9","25 July 2015"," ANT-tastic! Don't Belittle This Marvel Giant!
","I have to admit, when the Ant-Man trailer first came out months ago, I wasn't so sure if a miniature superhero would be viable and be taken seriously alongside the likes of Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, or Captain America, but to my surprise, the movie came on big, strong and powerful!<br/><br/>Of all the Marvel movies, Ant-Man doesn't rely on all-out explosions or gimmickry, but mostly held itself on a good storyline with its character development from a con-man to superhero. Great casting overall, from Paul Rudd who was a perfect cast for the role of Ant-Man - his biggest role to date. Great to see him in the spotlight after starring in numerous comedy movies over the years - including the teen hit movie Clueless which he starred alongside Alicia Silverstone 20 years ago. Kudos also to Michael Douglas as Ant-Man's mentor. Whoever was responsible on making him 30 years younger during the opening scenes should be given credit. It was like a nostalgic trip back to his Wall Street era. Evangeline Lilly also gave a classy performance as Dr. Pym's daughter. Michael Peña, with his fast-talking dubbed storytelling was hilarious and provided a balance of humor in the movie. But the only disappointment in the movie was Corey Stoll. His character Darren Cross & Yellowjacket wasn't developed enough and doesn't exude a vicious threat unlike other Marvel villains. <br/><br/>The visuals and action sequences were amazing and fun to watch. Realistically shot, it makes you feel like you're in there interacting with the ants. I really enjoyed the scenes especially when Ant- Man zooms in and out of microscopic size during the final battle scenes with Yellowjacket. It was done in tongue-in-cheek-style humor. Overall, the movie was enjoyable, lightweight in action, but engaging all throughout. Ant-Man succeeds, and is a big addition to the Marvel lineup of superheroes!"
"Mackiatoe","7","1","9","25 July 2015"," Has it's weak spots, but enjoyable nonetheless
","I hadn't paid too much attention to Ant-Man during the run up to its release, mainly because I'm not a Marvel super fan, so I went into this film without too many expectations. But I have to say, I was fairly surprised at how the movie turned out.<br/><br/>There's a lot to like about Ant-Man; it's a witty, fairly fast paced and well designed film, with a predictable but good story, typical characters and plenty of charm. To say the least, it's no more than a simple blockbuster summer movie, but it fits that mold excellently. It's easy to watch and flows nicely from scene to scene. <br/><br/>Probably the best aspect of the film is its key prop - the suit. As far as superhero flicks go, the Ant-Man suit is a really fun idea that is used to its full potential. The transition sequence is done well and it's not over dramatised as I feared it might have been. Its also well described; the exposition used to explain how it works fitted into the film without a hitch. <br/><br/>Michael Douglas's character is probably the next best thing about Ant- Man. He really picks up his role as Hank Pym with ease, and much of the film revolves around his actions. He's also one of the more expanded characters, with clearly defined weaknesses, which were lacking from others. Although the scene where he gets shot is a bit hard to believe, he's the main component in driving the story. <br/><br/>One of other aspects of Ant-Man that I particularly liked were the ants themselves; Pym's control device helped to add a bit more to capabilities of Scott Lang - the 'Ant Man' himself - and they helped to provide a bit of comic relief, especially during the training montages in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>Lang's three friends - Luis, Kurt and Dave - also helped with the comedic aspect. Although a bit boring at the start of the film, their role in the heist ensured things didn't get too serious, which was important in keeping Ant-Man from verging into the wrong territory. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd, who played Scott Lang, was also good. He was a bit on the simply side, but he played the role of Ant Man rather well. He didn't have a proper fatal flaw (which I would have preferred), but the next best thing - the relationship with his daughter and ex-partner - was used to good effect. It gave him the emotional depth that he lacked in other parts of the film. <br/><br/>That said, there were plenty of weak spots. The biggest one for me was Hope van Dyne; she was way too one sided as a character to justify some of the emotional scenes in the film. This was particularly apparent when Pym explained how her mother died. When she broke out into tears, all I could think of was how cheesy this scene was. <br/><br/>This also relates to another negative point; the back story. A lot of it simply isn't explained enough, and when characters start getting emotional about past events, it just didn't carry the weight it needed to really make those scenes effective. Probably the best example of this is Darren Cross's relationship with Pym. It just wasn't fleshed out enough, and when he got angry at Pym while revealing the Yellow Jacket to the Hydra agents, it felt flat and stereotypical. <br/><br/>The first act of the story was also a bit stodgy; it was noticeably slower than the rest of the film and didn't engage me much. It was only when Lang found the suit that things started to pick up. <br/><br/>The final act too left me a bit confused as to what I thought of it. It was, without a doubt, very enjoyable and genuinely funny in many places. But it was so frantic and ridiculous that made it feel fairly silly; certainly good to watch, but a bit out of place.<br/><br/>Regardless, however, I did enjoy Ant-Man. I don't feel it's a film I'm going to remember for any reason, mainly because it's just big screen, pop-corn action, but as far as that role is concerned, it does it brilliantly. And as far as Marvel films go, it keeps its references to other MCU movies limited, meaning anyone can enjoy it without a problem. In short, it's a fun, get-what-you-pay-for summer superhero movie that does things a little bit differently."

","The movie is truly worth every penny you spent on the tickets. A new major release from Marvel after Guardians Of The Galaxy and it has been one of my favorite. Showing a beautiful story with Marvel's State-Of-The-Art computer graphics, this movies hears the call of entertainment. Unlike, the other stereotypes from Marvel Cinematic Universe, this movie has actually a lot of potential to get an Oscar for comedy. Drama is up to a great extent and the fun it sprouts cannot be denied. It also depicts the feeling of bonds and relationships with one's family, beautifully depicts those times of life, when we have to bend with the wave and of course, Scott, without knowing much of Physics (unlike Stark) is very witty and intelligent and tackles problem with common concepts rather than simply throwing plasma all over.<br/><br/>This movie is really great.

"matthewssilverhammer","7","1","9","24 July 2015"," Fun and Light Marvel Offering
","The best Marvel movies work by effectively bringing their larger-than-life characters down-to-earth with quippy, self-zinging humor (The Avengers, Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy). Ant-Man's creators clearly have noticed this and are running with it. By casting the slyly funny and effortlessly charming Rudd as their size-shifting lead, they've anchored their tone in comedy all the while pushing the larger plot forward (notably, towards Marvel's Civil War). So even though it's somewhat unremarkable and full of the superhero clichés we've come to expect, Ant-Man passes as a middle-of-the-road MCU outing with refreshingly lightness and an immense sense of fun. You know the story: a troubled guy becomes a superhero to fight a bad-guy version of himself. One thing that makes it stand apart is its genre eclecticism. While it's certainly a comic-book movie, its cat-burglaring protagonist gives it more of a Mission: Impossible feel. Throughout its silly scifi contrivances and connections to the larger Avengers-protected world, we get small-scale heist set-pieces to counter the great Honey, I Shrunk the Kids style effects and changing perspectives. This narrower focus enhances the personal stakes between the colorful characters. The performances are great, with some solid dramatic turns by Lilly and Douglas, with Rudd and Pena being wonderfully hilarious. Unfortunately, these two sides to the thespian-coin (comedy / tragedy) don't always blend perfectly, with the tone bordering on goofy when the film tries too hard. Some lame been-there, done-that hero posturing slows the otherwise breezy levity that carries most of the movie. Luckily, that levity combined with unique action and funny people propels this fun little adventure tale past its faults."
"MattBrady099","6","1","9","23 July 2015"," A solid superhero movie
","Scott Lang/Ant-Man: ""Hello. I'm Ant-Man. Haven't you heard of me? No, you wouldn't have heard of me"".<br/><br/>The story to Ant-Man is about Scott Lang who has worked alongside his friend and mentor Dr. Hank Pym but has never truly asserted himself. Now, armed with a suit that shrinks him in size but greatly increases his strength, Lang, now dubbed Ant-Man, will have to find the hero inside himself in order to pull off a heist that may very well be the key to saving the world.<br/><br/>The tiny superhero himself Ant-Man was originally going to be directed by the comedy genius himself Edgar Wright. Everyone and I do mean everyone was hyped about his next upcoming movie since this is the same guy who brought us such films as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. But one day we all got the sad news that Edgar left the protect due to Marvel and him not agreeing on each other. It was so disappointing because I wonder what the movie would be like if Edgar Wright directed it. The movie was originally going to come out in 2014 but got pushed to 2015 due to that big delay. Now after seeing the movie I was surprised of how fun it was and how it was a solid movie even with the behind the scenes problems it all payed well. <br/><br/>Since Edgar was out we got another director that stepped in and that's Peyton Reed who did such movies like: Yes Man, The Break-up and Down with Love. I was a bit worried but at the same time a bit interested of what Peyton Reed will do with Edgar Wright source material and after seeing the movie I can safely say that Peyton Reed did a great job directing this movie. He directed the action scenes and the whole movie pretty well since he never directed action movies before and this is he's first time and he did it good. Nicely done Peyton Reed.<br/><br/>I never thought that Paul Rudd would be great playing superhero character when he was cast as Ant-Man, but Paul Rudd absolutely nailed it as Ant-Man as he had the charm, the right set of humor to balance his character nicely and he was the perfect actor for this comedic character like Ant-Man.<br/><br/>The humor in the movie are the basic Marvel humor that you always see in there movies. Edgar Wright also wrote the movie and at times I can tell what jokes and humor was his, but some other writers change a lot of the script (That's what I heard) adding some of the Avengers characters in the movie and at the end credit scene which Edgar didn't want and I can see why. Now it is good to see one or even more of The Avengers in another Marvel movie just for a little cameo but you know why they there to only set up the future Marvel movies and that's it really. That's just want it is really just a set up for the next movie and not let it be a good stand alone movie without other Avengers coming reminding you about the future Marvel movies. But that's just me. It's funny how I kept bringing up Edger Wright in this review, but what can say the guy is awesome. <br/><br/>The action scenes in the movie are just so stunning to watch. The action was excellently shot and when the character Ant-Man shrinks to ant size and takes down loads of enemies it was just awesome to watch it and it was a very creative action scene. The CGI in this movie really helped those action scenes or just the scenes where he's in ant size and everything around him is a size of a giant. Those scenes in the movie are worth the price of seeing. <br/><br/>I also love how this movie brought up the one thing that people always say ""Why don't they just call The Avengers"". In this movie they explain that it only takes a small person to do this small mission so you really don't need The Avengers to do this one small mission. I just love how the movie brought that up as it's saying shut the f**k up to those who are complaining about that. <br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly, Micheal Douglas, Michael Peña and the rest of the cast all did great in the movie as they were funny and truly enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Now for the problems: The villain of the movie Yellow Jacket played by Corey Stoll was a pretty weak villain and was kind of a cartoon villain at times. I think Corey Stoll is a great actor and I mean he was good in House of Cards and Midnight in Paris, but here he was the cliché I'm evil to do bad things to people and to are my character. He wasn't awful in the movie but he wasn't such a good villain. <br/><br/>Most of the character's in the movie felt like plot device like Scott's daughter in the movie as I could tell for a mile away what she's going to do later on in the movie and it happened as I expected.<br/><br/>Overall Ant-Man is another Marvel movie that turned out great just like Guardians. I like how Marvel are taking unknown comics that people never heard of and making them into big hits and everybody loving falling in love with them. Ant-Man was a lot of fun to watch and I actually like Ant-Man a little more than Age of Ultron, yeah I went there. Never again can anybody doubt Marvel for they next upcoming unknown project as you all known your going to eat it up and love it as always. Ant-Man is worth checking out."
"virindra","7","1","9","23 July 2015"," Very beautiful made,and original.
","I went to the cinema to watch this movie. First day and only 8 people in a very large room. I loved how Douglas played. Terrific actor, love him still. Acting was great, story and the action scenes as well. I had a little deja-vu when Scott shrunk himself and went under ground. It was like ""Honey I shrunk the kids"" but a very modern version of it. The way Scott went in the world of the ants was great.<br/><br/>Now what I didn't liked. The first half of the movie there was not much action. They took the first half of the movie to build up a story. That's way too long for an action movie. If there is going to be a second movie (with ant-woman, very attractive woman by the way) I hope they won't make the same mistake there was made with The Amazing Spiderman 2; First movie was awesome, second movie was an overkill of special effects and no heart to the story. Keep a good balance and don't let one take control.<br/><br/>Loved the movie. Great respect to Michael Douglas, to perform this well, at the same age of my father."

","...That you actually enjoy a movie you pay $10 for... Other than ""Jurassic World,"" the last couple of trips to the movie theater have been underwhelming, especially movies from Marvel. <br/><br/>I couldn't help but doubt this movie with the bitter taste of Captain America 2, Avengers 2, and Iron Man 3 in my mouth, but I decided to go see it with a friend; at the very least we could make fun of it. <br/><br/>Long story short, the movie rocked! <br/><br/>The objective of the movie was pretty similar to other Marvel origin movies: Flawed, underwhelming character becomes a superhero then is thrust into action to save humanity. This movie changed the original Ant Man (Hank Pym), to Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and in my opinion WORKED very well. <br/><br/>The movie was just fun all around. Funny scenarios, funny one liners, some of those ""I Love You Man,"" moments, funny lip reading situations, and just a great supporting cast including Michael Douglas, TI, Michael Pena, etc. This movie didn't take itself too seriously yet it still managed to have a serious note, some solid Avengers references, and some good action. <br/><br/>I was tickled pink when I got home and found that Edgar Wright had contributed to the script...There are several moments in the movie, particularly the Michael Pena involved scenes that are Hallmark- Edgar Wright. <br/><br/>The action, animation, and effects were awesome. The final climactic fight on the Thomas the Tank Engine toy set was both epic and hilarious at the same time.<br/><br/>You won't hear me say this too often, but I would HIGHLY recommend you see this movie in theaters."
"shawn-34613","8","1","9","23 July 2015"," Just a Fun Movie
","I thoroughly enjoyed Ant-Man. I didn't have high expectations because, honestly, the movie is based on a character whose super power is to shrink to the size of an ant. When you think about it logically it sounds ridiculous. But, as Marvel has proved time and again, they can make that premise entertaining. Sure some of it is a little ridiculous but we're talking about a super hero movie here, not a documentary.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is PERFECT for this role. I don't think anyone else could play Scott/Ant-Man any better. He's smart, funny and as Paul Rudd usually is, honest and real. All that just makes the movie more fun and completely hilarious.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly is also fantastic showing a wide range of emotions and acting talent. I'm so glad she didn't quit acting. I hope to see more of her. She did a great job in this film and it really showcased her talents. Just please, do something better with her hair. That do was awful.<br/><br/>Both Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll round out this cast very well. Douglas is believable and really nails this role. Stoll is creepy, mad and evil, just like the villain should be. And I have to include a shout out to Michael Pena who is absolutely hilarious in this movie. I've seen him do a range of characters and this one was his funniest yet.<br/><br/>All told, Ant-Man is a fun movie. It's not ground-breaking and it doesn't try to be as big as Avengers but it does its part well. It plays a small role in the Marvel universe and is a fun ride."
"wjets9","10","1","9","21 July 2015"," Unreal
","This movie is amazing. To be completely honest, when I heard that Paul Rudd was cast as a hero for Marvel, I was skeptical. Was I ever wrong.<br/><br/>Rudd plays Scott Lang, an ex-con just getting out of prison. Trying to go straight, he finds it incredibly hard to make a life for himself being an ex-con. After taking a burglary job he finds only a suit and questions why it is locked up in a vault. Obviously events lead to him eventually becoming ""Ant-Man"" and trying to stop the villain, Yellowsuit.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, The casting of Paul Rudd surprised me. However the script is perfectly suited to his talents, and he delivers a lights out performance. Dr. Hank Pym is played my Michael Douglas, and he delivers another fantastic performance, as a scientist trying to stop technology that he helped to pioneer from being sold to Hydra. Pym's daughter, Hope was cast to be Evangeline Lilly. She delivers a very solid performance in her role. Darren Cross, the villain, is played by Corey Stoll, and again, a lights out performance on him, making his character both crazy and very evil. Lang's ""crew"" is played by Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and T.I. and there are moments where they steal the movie, and definitely cause mass laughter. And always appreciated when an Avenger (Anthony Mackie in this case) makes an appearance.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was absolutely f-ant-astic (sorry I had to), and a must watch for any Marvel fan. I don't know where I'd rank it overall in the Marvel Universe, but this film is definitely near the top."
"StevePulaski","9","1","9","21 July 2015"," A reminder to why we see superhero films in the first place
","Marvel's ""Ant-Man"" is the most enjoyable Marvel film since ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and that, in my mind, is no surprise. Marvel's second tier films have a great deal more to offer audiences, especially ones who are well into their superhero fatigue, than the first tier superhero films like ""The Avengers,"" ""Captain America,"" and ""X-Men."" <br/><br/>To begin with, ""Ant-Man"" comes with far fewer expectations to live up to for no other reason than the titular character isn't popular amongst the masses. I'm willing to bet most of the people who are seeing ""Ant-Man"" over its theatrical run are curious parties that know they love Marvel products and are interested in a superhero of which they've never heard. Of course there are the legion of people who can recite Ant-Man's origins with the accuracy of a patriot's ability to recite ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" but the bulk of the mainstream, I feel, has only heard of Ant-Man from this specific product.<br/><br/>Because of this, Marvel doesn't have to stay firmly grounded in their origin conventions and can liberate the writers, directors, and actors in their respective positions. ""Ant-Man,"" for instance, lacks the sort of candy-colored Marvel sleekness we've come to expect with the onslaught of these superhero films and, pleasantly so, avoids justifying numerous exploding builds and shattering skyscrapers as the climatic event of the film. Like seeing things from an ant's eye view, ""Ant-Man"" toys with perception, captures big action on a small scale (something very revolutionary for Marvel), and packs a wallop that returns to what superhero films should be - unpredictable and fresh.<br/><br/>We begin in 1989, where a scientist named Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. when he realizes the organization is trying to duplicate his shrinking technology. Hank feels his invention was a dangerous accident and wants to keep the technology secret, even from his own organization. In the present day, however, Hank's estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) and Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) have elbowed their way into management, with Cross creating a shrinking suit he calls ""Yellowjacket"" for the purpose of inciting an army of microscopic vigilantes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, upon being released from prison, an amiable thief named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) moves in with his old cellmate Luis (Michael Peña) and his old crew (made up of rapper T.I. and David Dastmalchian) in order to try and obtain some money to support his child and his ex-wife (Judy Greer), who is now married to a police officer (Bobby Cannavale). Reluctantly, desperate to scrap together quick cash, Lang and his comrades decide to pull off another heist, this one on Hank following a tip that he's away for a weekend.<br/><br/>When Lang manages to break through Hank's large safe, he finds what looks to be a motorcycle suit, but upon putting it on, he realizes he now possesses the ability to shrink down to the size of an insect. He is eventually recruited by Hank to stop Cross and his Yellowjacket alter-ego.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is a wickedly interesting superhero for many reasons, but one of which is the fact that his superpowers aren't the result of a cockamamie genetic mutation. Lang, whenever he doesn't have possession of the suit, is a regular guy, indifferent from you and I, and this relatability amongst heroes grounds the film on a considerably human level. Even after some of the more rigorous action scenes (which aren't nearly as long-winded or tiresome as the ones in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""), Lang still shows his human side whilst trying to be there for his daughter and do right in a world where it seems the only way to get ahead is to do wrong.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Marvel subverts its own action formula by decidedly taking its action sequences down several notches in size and scope. Consider the scene where Lang first puts on the Ant-Man suit and subsequently shrinks; he is sucked down the drain of a shower onto lower-level floors, one of which is a nightclub. In this one, blink-and-you-miss-it scene, we see much of the tension and possibilities of this character exhausted, yet we're not even close to seeing what else this character can do even after the credits roll. The beauty of a character like Ant-Man is how visceral he is; when I see Captain America take on villains in every film, or even Iron Man attack his enemies with one quip after another, I still feel like I've seen it all.<br/><br/>Much has been made about ""Ant-Man""'s checkered production history, dating back to the 1980's, and the directorial shakeup that saw Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hot Fuzz"") eventually step down but still obtain a screenplay credit alongside the likes of Rudd, Joe Cornish, and Adam McKay. Peyton Reed's directorial vision is still as vibrant as ever, yet simultaneously not relying on a visual assault, but rather, a colorful palette of creativity, and Wright's influence is still very much felt in ""Ant-Man""'s script, which is littered with zingers. I was worried that much of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""'s lackluster attempts at comedy that ""Ant-Man' would wade in the water in terms of comedy. Like dozens of ants every year, my worries were squashed.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is one of the strongest films of Marvel's recent superhero batch, less predictable, more centered on the kind of free-wheeling, unpredictable fun from which superhero films should stem, and lacking the hardened expectations of the masses in favor of a looser approach. Like ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" there's a commendable level of respect for the titular hero, yet a certain irony that just questions, ""how did we get this far?"" in a way that doesn't end up insulting the respective hero(es)."

","Ant-Man (2015) Movie Review<br/><br/>Stars: Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, and Michael Pena.<br/><br/>Written by: Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Paul Rudd<br/><br/>First of all, I didn't want to see this movie. I thought it would be a failed attempt at a super hero movie like Green Lantern (2010). However, I was pleasantly surprised. Paul Rudd gave a great performance as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He reminded me of mix of Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark and Chris Pratt's Star Lord characters, but Rudd was also something new that worked well for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). I was expecting some good comedy from this movie especially since Adam Mckay (Anchorman, The Other Guys) was on the writing team. The comedy in this movie was great and gave the movie a humorous side. However, I do think that the villain (Corey Stoll) was a little bit underdeveloped. <br/><br/>I really hope to see more Ant-Man and I would be happy to see an Ant-Man 2. <br/><br/>Overall Grade: A-"

This movie is sophisticated, it doesn't bang you over the head with avengers references while still tying into the MCU very well, and it's hilarious. I am a fan of marvel movies and this one is up there with Captain America the winter soldier, and guardians of the galaxy for my favorites. People who go and see this will be surprised by the great performances of the actors/actresses and the great storytelling.

The characters are very elaborate and make what is already a fantastic idea for the franchise even better. This new power allows anything to now be make cool and seen from a new perspective and I think that's what made this film fly by. The story is great (as ever) and just makes you LOVE Ant-Man.

","Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, con-man Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.<br/><br/>For many moviegoers whose knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't extend to its second tier pantheon of superheroes, the thought of a microscopic man in a microscopic suit and mask may sound a bit, well, ridiculous. Neither super nor particularly heroic. However, if you don't have Thor's hammer, Captain America resolve or Iron Man know-how, what's an Avenger to do? The answer is: go small and exude a good sense of humour, which is precisely what floats this latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic firmament. Marvel had more to prove with Ant-Man than any other post-Iron Man MCU entry and Phase 2 closer might be the sucker punch few expected this year. In fact, there never been true classics among human shrinkage wee sub genre, as the format does force filmmakers to visualise the world from a very particular point of view and that never been easy for anyone. After Captain America: The Winter Soldier's conspiracy curves, Ant-Man arrives with a burglar trying to go straight who reverts to crime because the only post-prison job he can get is a McJob. The run time of the movie is well spent on setting fresh character connections. Those links are plotted with satisfying symmetry across a pattern of fathers/children and mentors/protégés. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd nails it as Scott Lang, he's such a likable addition to the MCU and I absolutely loved his portrayal of the character. This guy brings a sort of average-Joe charm, bringing the film to life with his sharp comic timing, almost like Chis Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) he's smart enough to handle these films with a light touch. Rudd is helped by an ace supporting cast. Having an actor of Douglas' calibre on board lends the film some gravitas to balance the humour. Michael Douglas is fantastic in this movie, not just because it's Michael Douglas and he's a hell of an actor, he's talented and it's nice to see him in a good movie; but they gave Hank Pym such a good back story. His relation with his daughter ads a great depth to this film and took it in the right direction. Douglas resumes his Wall Street-ish mentor mode which ads wrinkly warmth, he sells every line as Hank Pym: this genius who, by the way it must be noted, also fathered Ultron in the comic books canon (in earliest movie he was created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner). Michael Pena is comedy gold, every word coming out from this guy mouth is perfect, he nails every line as well. Yet, the villain is purely a plot devices. He's just a big evil guy who's really good at being evil and like to do evil things, like shrinking lambs without even feeling a shred of guilt. He's not a compelling character. Darren Cross acts stupidly and harshly when things are on the line. He doesn't have the demented grand vision that a major villain should have - Ultron would have him for a snack. <br/><br/>Marvel was once again able to take a less known, a lot smaller hero and make it as entertaining as this film was, it really paid off. Writer Edgar Wright mostly perfectly captured the comedy/drama/action balance. The story dynamics are fundamentally silly but the action sequences are very well done. The film deals with divorce, estranged fatherhood, societal alienation which sounds more like a Bruce Springsteen song than a Marvel pitch; but the comic relief is judiciously dished out and the first half hour has a lighter hearted approach. The story central conflict does not involve Scott but rather, Pym and his betrayer. This movie understood that it was a smaller movie. It's knowingly small scaled which is alright because heroes are also small scaled sometimes. Visually, the 3D really ads something to the action scenes at least - god knows I'm not a huge fan of 3D. This has to be highlighted as those scenes where Scott shrank down in size, they blurred out the background so deeply do that the focus was solely on this tiny man running around. It worked very well for those sequences. <br/><br/>Indeed, the action scenes are stunning to look at, the cgi isn't obvious at all, it may be due to the photo realistic aspect of the whole cinematography. Ant-Man isn't perfect. The structure isn't perfectly balanced in the first act. Sometimes it's very funny and sometimes deadly serious. This feels like couple different movies are happening at once. Finally, the comedy prevails in a project that is historically integral to the Marvel map of the world but also seems on the margins of it. I won't spoil anything but I also loved the way it tied into other MCU instalments with references. Marvel did it again. Ant-Man is a lot of fun, I laughed constantly throughout this film. <br/><br/>Overall Ant-Man is a refreshing proposition, in a super-sized summer, the dinosaurs and Arnie-bots won't know what it them. Reed and Rudd's film, is proof that no matter how silly some ideas might sound at first, good things often do come in small packages."
"condillon","Null","1","9","17 July 2015"," Marvel has done it once again!
","Ant-Man follows Dr. Hank Pym, who recruits the talents of Scott Lang, a master thief just released from prison. Lang becomes Ant-Man, trained by Pym and armed with a suit that allows him to shrink in size, possess superhuman strength and control an army of ants. The miniature hero must use his new skills to prevent Darren Cross, also known as Yellowjacket, from perfecting the same technology and using it as a weapon for evil.<br/><br/>Well Marvel, you have done it once again. Peyton Reed certainly gets huge props for taking the sworn duty of directing such a spectacle of a superhero film, after having complications with production, Reed really pulled off a well directed film with a tremendous special effects team that made this little hero come to life.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd, bringing such a magnetic performance as Scott Lang was certainly a sight for sore eyes, he didn't take his role to seriously and brought a carefree guy who really grows on you and just can't help but love. Most of comic flair in this works so well because of this terrific casts chemistry, Michael Peña being one of the biggest highlights of the film brought pure hilarity, not just him but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas were along with the ride as well.<br/><br/>The action which was so stimulating and engaging that you can't take your eyes off the screen, the special effects were so mind boggling that you can't help to applaud the people behind it. The action is really one of the most engaging parts of the film that it gives such a adrenaline rush to your viewing experience, comic from the view point of our hero makes it more funny and strongly compelling.<br/><br/>The villain wasn't really all that menacing to me, we get so little backstory that there isn't much believability to these evil deeds but he did do a terrific job in the action. The first 15- 20 minutes did put a little bump into the story because like Marvel does, we need to know why our hero is doing what he's doing but it doesn't affect the film all that badly.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is definitely a superhero film of a different size, extremely captivating and compelling, AM delivers enough pleasure and hilarity to satisfy amongst the giants!"

","Antman it is. Well then. When you think about it, a choice as smart as long overdue when it comes to Superheroes. The forgotten one, right? The one that literally somehow kept under the radar for so long. His time has finally come and he arrives on the big screen in full glorious swing. Let's have a quick go: the first Cross killing is spectacular in its simplicity. I honestly have never seen anything like that before. And believe you me, I've seen everything to compare it with. OK then, some quick story building, handled swift enough to not walk right into the trap of insignificance. Then ... Old Man has Safe. Followed by Mission Impossible Styles actually done better, swift and crispy. To henceforth bare witness to the initiation is a fun-ride, intoxicating and entertaining, Super Hero Shtick like it should be done, fluid and fast with the kind of light footed timing that will joyfully nail you to your seat with a grin on your face. Pure bliss. Throwing around Drama, interrupted and metamorphosed through the childish carelessness of our Goop Hero, again with flawless timing. It is convincing that this hero (like many others) keeps this sense of naivety, because anyone who would go through such fundamental changes and gain such transforming and up-heaving powers, while keeping stuff under control like he obviously does, would have to remain a jester at heart in a deeply magical and philosophical sense. And have a good laugh at it. <br/><br/>What else have we got? How about Quantum Physics! Ant-agonizing Avenger Bashing! And whose pajamas are those? Subatomic Beauty and...well alright, some heart-wrenching blockbuster blubber to patch it up, but I shrug that off. What remains is a contender for one of the top spots within the Subgenre, All American Fuss aside, Ant-Man reaches heights it may not aspired for, but has managed to do so nonetheless."

","This is probably the best example of a standard modern superhero movie. Of course there are a few things that are slightly above average otherwise i obviously would give it a 5 and not a 6.<br/><br/>I'm happy to see, that the actors and the effects are back being nothing less but great which i thought would be the standard in Marvel movies nowadays but avengers 2 proofed me wrong on that. But in Ant- Man those things are not only back to the way they should be but also slightly improved.<br/><br/>The writing is also back to normal. The script isn't anything near excellent but it's decent enough and the characters are also written in a way that the actors have something work and experiment with. Even tough they are very clichéd.<br/><br/>Otherwise there is nothing much to say. The rest of the film is completely average. It has decent action, standard cinematography, a predictable, but not necessarily bad, story, a generic score, a few jokes here and there, a ton of hints to current and future Marvel movies and the obligatory Stan Lee cameo. But i have to admit, that Ant- Man is probably the first superhero in a marvel movie who i thought had powers that i want to have for myself, because the way they show these powers is really cool.<br/><br/>If you're interested in the movie, give it a watch but don't expect to be blown away."
"kimphan","8","1","10","4 August 2015"," Little hero, Big surprise
","Alright. Ant-Man... Excited? .. nah, not really.. I am a huge super hero/sci-fi fan, I love these kind of movies because they feed my vivid imagination. I've seen most of the superhero movies, lately and even the older ones and the shitty ones. Right now with all the Avengers/Captain America mania the Ant-Man was quite bold to try to compete with those guys. When I saw the trailer I wasn't really excited. I thought ""yea..I will probably go see it, but Ant-Man is meh.."" I'm sure many people thought the same thing. The trailer itself is a little corny and maybe the whole movie is. But it is fun. I didn't think I would say that before I went to see it, but it really is. First of all I don't really like Paul Rudd, I still see him in F*R*I*E*N*D*S and to me he will always be that guy. However in this movie he does a really good job and I liked him! Michael Douglas as well. I didn't really like E.Lily that much but that's maybe because of her stupid wig and the fact that she just looked like a milf. The whole movie is really entertaining, there are some LOL moments when I really bursted into laughter and there's also some great lines. If you can't decide then give it a chance, you won't regret it. On the downside the movie is kinda for kids yea.. There's cute ants and not really much of any violence. A few fights and miniature explosions but that's it. There is also absolutely no suspense, which was a little disappointing. Throughout the whole movie you will not be tense or fear for someone's life. I mean of course every movie is the same, for a little while the bad guy beats the hero but the hero wins in the end. But in this movie the bad guy doesn't really seem to be that dangerous. Other than that the movie was great and I encourage everyone to go see it."

","I went to watch ""Ant-Man"" with the idea of watching another commercial super-hero movie of our days. What a great surprise when I realized that this film was going to hold my attention and make me enjoy during the entire two hours of film.<br/><br/>The story is not too complex: the main character (Ant-Man) has to avoid the bad usage of the Pym technology, which is able to reduce the size of anything, with the help of Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter.<br/><br/>At first glance, saving the world does not seem any revolution in the genre. However, the idea and methodology of achieving this objective are fascinating. The way of dealing with the quantum world is outstanding. I love how the director has mixed the microscopic and macroscopic world and how it is explained during the film. At some point, it reminds me of ""Interstellar"" but applying the quantum theory instead of the theory of relativity. I also like the usage of the ants and the different roles of each type of ant.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" is not the kind of movie that abuses of action scenes, which is welcome nowadays. Furthermore, I find terrific how hilarious moments are introduced during the whole plot. It has been literally irresistible not to laugh at certain moments of the film.<br/><br/>To sum up, I highly recommend ""Ant-Man"". You will not regret spending the price of the ticket."
"RockerJarvis","8","1","10","2 August 2015"," The perfect ANTidote
","Marvel Studios have created something a little different here (pun intended), they have been able to introduce a fan favorite character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, one that loved by many, but at the same time, a character that is unknown to many others too. Ant-Man is a fresh change from the normal Marvel film, or superhero film for that matter. We don't have all the massive destruction, or city toppling events found in many other Marvel (or DC) Universe films, and even through there is the odd building getting flattered here, its not in the fore front of this story.<br/><br/>Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is the new (or next if you follow the comic lore) Ant-Man. He is able to change to microscopic size, which then hyper intensifies everything he does, from speed, to agility, to strength, but (just) being 'Ant-Man' doesn't mean he is a master of his craft from the first second he jumps in the suit, he has to learn as he goes along, and work out how to use the suit to his best advantage. This includes help from the suits creator Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and even a little help from Pym's daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). When Lang changes in size, everything then changes for himself, so the environment that he would take for granted, like a bath, or a dripping tap, once changed size, this environment will become a hyper realistic environment to him (and a wonder for the audience to look at), so that bath will become a canyon, and that drip will become an gushing ocean.<br/><br/>This is where all most of the fun come from in Ant-Man. When Lang changes size, the way this is filmed puts it all to fantastic use. Of course there is CGI here, but there are also camera tricks, and clever filming aspects that make us really think Lang has changed into the size of an Ant. I loved watching these scenes, everything from a simple running through to carpet, which now to Lang felt like a forest, to the rushing and changing sizes to punch a guard in the face as he is about to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>That's not to say the scenes that didn't involve Scott Lang becoming Ant-Man were poor, the likes of Douglas' Pym was awesome and built up his character from the very off to the very end, giving insights into his why, how and who, and the likes of the 'baddie' here, Darren Cross played by Corey Stoll, who might not be the name puller to the general cinema goer, but he was excellent here as Yellow-Jacket, and was actually a scene stealer in a fair few occasions.<br/><br/>In each scene that Corey Stoll was in, be is Cross, or Yellow-Jacket, I enjoyed his presence, and as soon as they built up this character from a friend to a foe he just shone even more. I also loved the look of the Yellow-Jacket suit, this looked both awesome and at times scary. There is a scene where Yellow-Jacket is in a young girls room (building up to the fantastic final act), but just this scene can feel very menacing the younger viewing, plus the play on lines in the scene 'Are you a monster?' were delivered beautifully by the young actress played by Abby Ryder Forston, who plays Scott Lang's daughter Cassie Lang.<br/><br/>We need to give some massive props to Michael Douglas. This is the best acting I've seen from him in years. He played Hank Pym to perfection. We may not have seen all the dark side, that the Hank Pym story is known for (drugs, beatings, alcoholism etc so may have been a good choice considering the family element that Ant-Man is playing to) but the way he conveyed this character on screen, as this father figure looking for someone to take on his work, was a joy to behold.<br/><br/>There is a lot here to love in Ant-Man, the acting from everyone was sublime, the likes of Evangeline Lilly showing that she certainly could be 'The Wasp' if the power that be wanted to take that character into the MCU too. She is Hope Van Dyne after all! It was also great to see loads of little nods here and there to future possibilities in the series, the likes of speaking about the Avengers in general, or the fact that Lang's suit had multiple buttons, some that did not work, could relate to future characters in the Ant-Man verse, the likes of when Ant-Man become Goliath, that could make the next parts of the Ant-Man story massive, on so many levels! <br/><br/>There was flickering of action here and there within Ant-Man in the first hour or so, and in all honestly, the real action only kicked in, in the last 25 or so minutes, which when thinking about a superhero movie is unusual, but I give massive dues here, as it built these characters, and showed the unknowing audience who they are, and why they should be loved.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is the perfect ANTidote to the heavy superhero films that we have had over the last few year. I loved the fact that this was more a character driven story, and even though there is action here, and when the action kicks off it certainly kicks off, Ant-Man just felt different to the others that we are used to in the Marvel Universe, it even at times, felt like a heist movie, I loved that. Ant-Man was a fun ride from start to finish and deserves your viewing, and is a very worthy film to be added to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

","Ant-Man is a ton of fun as a movie. It offers up some of the biggest laughs of the summer, and it shows that Marvel can pull back from their iconic huge action spectacles, and tell a smaller story with just as much success as their other films.<br/><br/>The cast in this movie is literally perfect. Paul Rudd nails it as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. His performance in this movie is so charming, that you just can't help but like this newest addition to the MCU. But Michael Douglas Oh my gosh. Michael Douglas as Hank Pym is absolutely perfect. However, this isn't just because Douglas gives a fantastic performance. It's because the writers gave Hank Pym such a cool and interesting back story that really gets the viewer invested in his character. Evangeline Lilly does a great job portraying Hank's daughter Hope in this film, and I love the how their relationship develops throughout the film. And Michael Pena, who plays Scott's friend Luis, brings exactly the right amount of comedy to the film whenever its needed. Every line out of his mouth is absolute comedy gold, and he was just rocking it in this movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>It should go without saying, since this IS a Marvel movie, that the visual effects are out of this world. The attention to detail with the CGI whenever Ant-Man shrinks is truly astounding, and I love how they blurred out everything else around him when he's small. This allowed me to focus on how this really small man is actually running through a bath tub, or underground, or in an air vent, and that just pushed the action scenes to be even more incredible than they could've been otherwise. <br/><br/>I also love how this movie ties in with other Marvel films. There's actually an explanation for why the Avengers can't come remedy every situation, and it makes perfect sense within the circumstances of the MCU. Also, I appreciate how this film is on a smaller scale compared to the Avengers, as its hero is also very small. This film understands exactly what it is, and Marvel just roles with it, and I love that. <br/><br/>I will say, the first twenty minutes of this film have a couple of conflicting tones; one is funny, and one is serious, and they don't exactly mesh. Also, while I really enjoyed Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket in this film, and I loved all of his action scenes, I thought that he paled in comparison to other villains in the MCU when compared to Loki, Ultron, the Winter Soldier, and Thanos. However, none of this detracts from my immense enjoyment of this film.<br/><br/>Despite the smaller-scale compared to Marvel's other films, Ant-Man is an absolute blast of a movie, and this film definitely solidifies its legacy among the rest Marvel's collection of heroes. It's a fantastic way to close out Phase 2 of the MCU, and I can't wait till next summer for Captain America: Civil War. <br/><br/>Also, there's two very awesome end-credit scenes at the end of the film, so don't forget to watch those."

","I wasn't sure that I would like this, cause after the whole Edgar Wright thing. But I gave this movie the benefit, and did I like it?<br/><br/>Scott Lang(Paul Rudd) a former thief who is trying to make ends meat, but finds himself in a situation by millionaire Hank Pym(Michael Douglas) who is an inventor of a suit that shrink to the size of an ant, Pym himself was a former superhero known has Ant Man, he is looking at Lang to be the new Ant Man.<br/><br/>I really liked this, it was nothing real big like The Avengers but it was a real fun time. The shrinking effects are terrific, just really keeps you glued. A lot of people where not sure about casting of Paul Rudd as the hero, but Paul Rudd has such a likable presence about him, proved to be the best choice. Michael Douglas was also great. Michael Pena really steals a lot of the movie for any scene he is in, cause he just delivers the laughs. My only problem with this is the villain, he never comes across to frightening to the point you'll feel shaken in your seats. But I really was entertained, I hope to see more Ant Man films in the future."

"Quinoa1984","7","1","10","17 July 2015"," a fun, well-made B movie from Marvel
","Ant-Man delivers much of the fun, good (if silly) stretches of the comedy, and the wacky comic-book science fiction stuff that many of us come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's also a movie that caused some movie people to raise their eyebrows when the original director Edgar Wright parted ways with Marvel over some ""creative differences"". What was it exactly, we may never know, though there's been speculation about the studio and producers like Kevin Feige forcing on the other aspects of the MCU onto what is an origin story mostly unto itself about Dr. Hank Pym restarting his Ant-Man design with thief Scott Lang (Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd, both cast by Wright). Whatever the case, we now have the movie we have in front of us. For me, I saw little things that did indicate it was still Wright's work (and he shares script and story credit with Joe Cornish, along with Rudd and Adam McKay), while still being basically a fairly safe comic-book movie.<br/><br/>What I mean by comic-book movie isn't meant to be a put-down, though with the deluge we've been getting in theaters (or it feels like that due to the over-marketing of them) there's always the possibility of fatigue from all of the explosions and daring-do. At the heart of Ant-Man is lots of goofy science that is explained in the way that it is through these kinds of movies, not just of the Marvel kind but just of any goofy sci-fi flick (atoms, and things becoming Sub-Atomic as well, which I'll get to later). At the same time it's also a father-daughter story, as both Pym and Lang are fathers who have to do right by them - it's what drives them both, and the scenes between Douglas and Evangeline Lilly feel strong enough in that regard (her mother, Hank's wife and the original Wasp we learn, died due to an accident in the 80's).<br/><br/>We only see so much of Rudd and his daughter, and for me that was kind of perfunctory for the story: his drive to do right by his daughter is mentioned repeatedly, not least of which by his ex-wife and the girl's new father (Bobby Cannavale, always a welcome presence), but we only see so much of that bond between them, given that Lang's just gotten out of jail. But it's fine - the desire to see her will, I guess, drive him to have better control over his ant army (no kidding) to get into places and ""steal stuff"" as the trailer says. And for what he's asked for, Rudd makes this a fun, likable anti-turned-real hero, and delivers the quips and one-liners given with the comic umph that they're needed.<br/><br/>The action moves swiftly enough and is directed competently. I mention 'competently' not to make Peyton Reed seem like some kind of hired hack - hired, though he was, he shows some visual flair, most notably when a character finally becomes ""Sub-Atomic"", which is as much a credit to the VFX wizards at Marvel studios, but is probably the highlight of the movie for me, when things story-wise get most desperate too - but is it missing its original director? This could be a good example to show in film schools down the line of how a script can have solid comic beats and unexpected moments for characters (primarily the wildest and funniest lines are given to Lang's co-horts in crime, most especially Michael Pena), while still missing a real visual edge. Again, this isn't badly directed exactly, and I'm sure things like the Thomas the Tank Engine gag, and not just what you see in the trailer but everything else, could have been screwed up in even more incapable hands.<br/><br/>But maybe there could've been more to the villain. Here we get Corey Stoll as Cross, a pretty terrific actor (Midnight in Paris, House of Cards especially) and here we know who this character is - Pym's former protégé gone corporate criminal mastermind - from minute one, without any ambiguity. But it didn't make him very interesting, and I felt kind of sorry for such a guy as good as he is to be given a character who is at best two dimension if not less (""I saw too much of me in you,"" Hank basically says to Cross to explain to the audience why he is the way he is, the bad parts magnified). There's also some science with the character and the Yellow-Jacket suit that get rushed in the third act, but really it is another example of a Marvel villain getting the short-shrift; maybe not to the extent of Ronen in 'Guardians', but close enough.<br/><br/>Still, the heroic side is what is most often strong in these MCU movies, and Rudd and Lilly deliver for the characters solid acting chops, and you care (up to a point at least) about the conflicts. Douglas does too, and maybe gives the most... most character, I guess (interesting, captivating, troubled, you pick). Pym has so much that has happened in his life, much heart-break, lost scientific dreams either stolen away from him or, worse, it went to his head. It makes me want to see an Ant-Man pre-origin movie, albeit with another actor (and no more weird CGI to make actors look younger, like in the opening scene of this - weird).<br/><br/>He's the kind of star a film like this needs alongside the other capable and ready-to-do-this players, and makes Ant-Man a fun experience with its complex heist involving (yes) a fleet of ants, and the ability of the hero to shrink and grow large with the push of a button. A cool power, which I hope to see more of in these movies. But top tier for this studio? Not quite."
"peefyn","7","1","11","8 August 2015"," Great gags, but not enough
","Guardians of the Galaxy kept me smiling throughout the movie, Ant-man did not. And I felt it should have.<br/><br/>The movie does a lot of things correctly. It shows how Ant-man's powers actually are really cool. And that he completely holds up as a superhero. It introduces some really cool characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And it has some great visuals at time (though some sequences were disappointing). How it plays around with shrinking/deshrinking is also really fun. They have quite a few really funny gags. But there was room for many more. Too much of the movie is exposition, they could easily have cut down on the opening explanations and introductions. (Or: What do I know what they could have ""easily"" have done or not, I've never made a movie. But it felt like there was way too much.) I had a hard time distancing the movie from Edgar Wright. I knew about his involvement, and I was looking forward to seeing his version from the moment it was announced. And I was really disappointed when it was announced he wouldn't direct it after all. So watching the movie, I kept thinking about what the sequences could have been. Instead of what they were. Hopefully I will be able to appreciate it more next time I see it."

","Have we seen a Marvel heist movie? No, we have not. But then out of the blue, BAM! There we go! We now have Ant-Man, the best heist movie in all time! The plot follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) as he is introduced as this badass burglar who jacked a couple of houses and got locked behind bars. (Paul Rudd was basically himself in this movie). So we are then introduced to Cassie Lang (Abby Ryder Fortson) who is the cute daughter of Scott. Cassie is an important character in this movie as she is basically the moral support of Scott. Scott then is informed by a huge score which Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) intentionally leaked out to sources. Scott breaks in using smart mechanics and finds that there is only a suit. Scott puts it on and tests it out, he is then frightened as the suit suddenly shrinks and he hears Hank's voice. Hank then guides Scott as he trains to adapt to the suit. After rough turns and some training, they are ready to take on Yellow Jacket (Corey Stoll). After a massive battle they defeat Yellow Jacket, and Scott makes out with Hank's daughter. This movie is smart and witty, it makes Age of Ultron go to shame. If I had a bunch of money, I would invest it on making a sequel to this movie. They perfectly introduce Ant- Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they had the perfect cast. This movie is worth buying on Blu-ray! If you like Marvel movies or you like heist movies, I'm sure you'll like this one."

There is not one flaw with the movie, and I recommend that everybody go see it and have a great time. Also, stay for the end credits, as there is two scenes that I won't spoil, but they are amazing.

","22 July 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Ant-Man I have to say, Marvellous Marvel does it again. Is there no end to the stories that come out of that Company. Only this last weekend I voiced the opinion that the market has become somewhat saturated by Marvel in the last couple of years, but this film was very entertaining. Scott Lang (played by Paul Rudd) has been chosen and is being watched by Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), to don a special suit which not only enables him to shrink but also increase his strength. Utilising the organisational skills and strength of various species of ant, Ant-Man and Pym together with Pym's daughter Hope, unite to prevent disaster happening to the world. On the face of it, this film is no different to any other super hero film, but delve a little deeper and you come across some real gems of comedic timing, visual gags and subtle nuances that keep the storyline trotting along quite nicely. There are some great scenes where Scott Lang is training to become Ant-Man, and at first failing miserably, and there are also some fine Avenger references!!!! Don't forget, it's a Marvel Film, you need to stay to the very end of the credits."
"JontheLobsterLover","10","1","12","17 July 2015"," Honey I Shrunk the Kids meets Iron Man
","Ant-Man is an all around fun movie that was obviously made with love for both the comics and the MCU.<br/><br/>All the movies in the MCU have a little comedy in them. With the exception of Guardians of the Galaxy most of the movies however rely heavily on the action to pull people in. Ant-Man is much more relatable to Guardians of the Galaxy from that point. The jokes come flying from everyone, most notably Michael Peña.<br/><br/>I admit before even hearing about this movie I had no idea who Scott Lang was. To me, Ant-Man was Hank Pym, and that's all I knew. Although it was great to be introduced to a new character, I thought it was amazing that hey pay homage to the original Ant-Man with a flashback of Hank in the suit; also for the ride was Wasp; which of course everyone freaked out about.<br/><br/>A lot of supporting characters make their way into the movie, making all the fan boys squeal with glee. Everyone from Howard Stark and Peggy Carter, to the flashback I mentioned above with the original Ant-Man and Wasp. The Falcon is obviously in the movie, as given away from the trailers. Spider-Man Is mentioned in a pretty subtle way towards the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was simply amazing. Paul Rudd did a very convincing job playing his character. You laughed with him, you cried with him, you everything with him. Corey Stoll played Darren Cross aka Yellow jacket. Another character I'm not too familiar with. You really get lost in his cause though and really feel where he's coming from. Until he becomes a complete jerk and you realize that he's just being an ass. He plays insane both inside and outside the suit very well though and I highly commend him for that.<br/><br/>This movie was obviously made for 3D and this is one that I feel would be very worth seeing in 3D. All the scenes were visually beautiful even when not seeing in that format. The bathtub scene when he first shrinks down dropped my jaw. The final act of the movie with the amazing fight sequences were just that; AMAZING. The amount of detail in the choreography makes for scene after scene of amazing beauty.<br/><br/>This movie has it all and I have debated over giving it a 9 or a 10. After much thought and reliving the movie in my head there is no way I can give it less than a 10. It had me from the very beginning and did not let me go."

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","1","2 March 2020"," Make us embark on a story with a content difficult to believe at first, and a good direction and cast
","Just as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy' were a high stakes, so can 'Ant-Man'. The hero was at the foundation of the Avengers in the 60s, but he never held a big solo title or managed to migrate to the top echelon of the publisher and here he gains a golden opportunity to finally get recognition at the hands of director Peyton Reed, known for his romantic comedies ""Down with Love (2003)"", ""Separated by Marriage (2006)"" and ""Yes Lord (2008)"", but who had never taken on a major Hollywood blockbuster. Reed ended up replacing the acclaimed English director Edgar Wright, of the excellent ""Everybody Almost Dead (2004)"" and ""Scott Pilgrim Against the World (2010)"", who ended up abandoning the project due to creative differences shortly before filming began. This ended up worrying fans of the DC universe, but the final result on the screens delivers an exciting and fun adventure, which knows how to fully insert itself in the shared universe together with the other VIngers, but which, above all, manages to support itself only, establishing the hero for the general public.<br/><br/>Forced to leave his own company by former protégé Darren Cross, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits the talents of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a thief who has just emerged from prison. Lang becomes Ant-Man, trained by Pym and armed with a suit that allows him to shrink in size, possess superhuman strength and control an army of ants. The miniature hero must use his new abilities to prevent Cross, also known as Yellowjacket, from perfecting the same technology and using it as a weapon for evil, including selling the technology to HYDRA.<br/><br/>The plot already begins showing Scott Lang the day he leaves prison after three years for committing an assault. Seeking to show that he's changed and wanting to make up for lost time, Scott needs to get a job, a place to live to try to see his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) again, but as a former inmate, he has a hard time getting a job. Because of this, he ends up deciding to return to the life of theft, unaware that he was being watched by Dr. Hank Pym, who sees him as the perfect person, for his willingness to redeem himself in order to live with his daughter again, his intelligence and abilities , to assume the identity of Ant-Man.<br/><br/>When Ant-Man first appeared on the comic book pages, he was attended by Hank Pym, a scientist. Years later, he ends up giving up his secret identity in the name of a new volunteer, former thief Scott Lang. Dr. Pym, as a guardian, is a nearly retired genius, with only mentioning that he was the one who wore the Ant-Man costume previously (even shown in action alongside his wife many years before, when they participated in one of your missions in the past). The biggest hits of the script are precisely the emotional part, which accompanies a thief in the best Robin Hood style (who steals from the rich and gives to the poor) in search of redemption, trying to be a hero to his daughter, being 'the person who daughter already thinks he is'. That's the main motivation for Scott to want to change and start his life over, trying to do the right thing.<br/><br/>In the following acts, we can follow the first contact that Scott has with the Ant-Man costume, the discovery of his powers, the escape from prison with the superhero costume, the initial training in fights to become agile fast and achieve shrink and increase in seconds for the suit to suit your needs, in addition to learning to communicate so you can command your army of ants. It is extremely interesting how the concept of Ant-Man is presented, explaining the various types of ants and how they can be useful with their faithfulness and teamwork, adapting to the need and situation. One could even have invested a little more in these scenes, since they show the evolution of Lang becoming Ant-Man, besides being extremely funny.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd was a wise choice to play the miniature hero. He lends all his charisma to this interpretation. The interaction between Dr. Pym, Scott Lang and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lily) flows fully. At first, considered Scott to be a bad choice to take on the hero's costume and wanting to take the lead herself, Hope starts to get more and more involved with Scott, dividing great scenes together, culminating even in something else towards the end of the projection . Michael Douglas does very well as a mentor and gives complete credibility to the brilliant scientist who seeks to prevent global chaos. Only his shaky relationship with his daughter Hope is overly dramatized. The impression that remains is that a conversation between father and daughter could have taken place a long time ago about the reasons that led him to want to protect his daughter all these years. Also worthy of note is Lang's little daughter, Cassie, who is super charismatic on the scene, in addition to companions and assault Kurt (David Dastmalchian), Dave (T.I.) and Luis (Michael Peña). The latter steals the show whenever he appears. The villain Darren Cross, the Yellow Jacket, played by Corey Stoll is not really a negative point, but the cartoonish tone of his villain clashes with a few more realistic interpretations of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>It is curious to see how the concept of Ant-Man, however unlikely, brings many possibilities through his technological suit. In the last third of the plot, we noticed these possibilities both in the form of resources used by Scott to fight the enemy, so much to be explored in the filming. Peyton Reed delivers a firm and daring direction, exploring camera movements and frames very well that show the back and forth of Scott's shrinking / rising, making us embark on the story and see the world through the eyes of the hero. The dimension changes in the most varied scenarios, causing people and objects to suddenly appear and disappear from the place where the action takes place is surprising and exciting, causing the pace to grow in a surprising way.<br/><br/>We must also mention the links with the Marvel universe. All of them occur organically and not pushed in a way just to show that the film is inserted in the same space / time as the Avengers, who are mentioned by Scoot and Dr. Pym at a certain time. The main mention is related to Tony Stark, whom Dr. Pym has always wanted to avoid having contact with his technology because he considers it too complicated if it fell into the wrong hands. We also see Scott's first appearance before one of the Avengers, Falcão (Anthony Mackie) when he invaded the Avengers headquarters. The fight between Falcon and Ant-Man, besides being fun and creative, is a delight for movie fans. This meeting will result in the future participation of Ant-Man together with The Avengers. Even a quick quote to Spider-Man appears in the final scenes, implying that he is also close to showing up in future Casa das Ideias films. In the post-credit scenes, there are two scenes: one revealing the emergence of a new heroine and one with the participation of an original Avenger and one of the biggest villains in the Marvel Universe.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is clearly a studio film that works very well with the formula in hand. Much of the humor that we already know so well is present, in addition to great visual effects that give realism and make us embark on a story with a content difficult to believe at first, and a good direction and cast. It is a great introduction to yet another hero in the world of the Avengers and his integration with the other heroes should not take long to occur. It's two fun and magical hours that fly by and make you anxious about what's yet to come with the character and the impending Civil War."

","Falling squarely in the ""overlooked and somewhat underappreciated"" camp of Marvel films, 2015's 'Ant-Man' was not our typical effort from the studio. The Paul Rudd/Michael Douglas/Evangeline Lilly-starrer was a little bit goofy, kind of awkward but still fun, and for that reason it remains one of the odd men out among the bigger, badder entries from the 'Iron Man' and 'Captain America' franchises.<br/><br/>'Ant-Man' has a few things going for it, namely Rudd. He's the unlikely underdog superhero in the vein of Spider-Man, falling into his role and needing to live up to sizeable expectations. Rudd is perfectly cast for this part, as his ""aw shucks"" personality and non-intimidating demeanor make him an unassuming agent. Lilly's Hope van Dyne is the kind of unpredictable, cutthroat semi-villain who could be just as helpful as she could be dangerous, and her onscreen father, Douglas's Dr. Pym is a likeable grandfatherly mad scientist type. Together, they make a band of renegades who might just have what it takes to thwart evil corporate suit Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). We also see some surprising supporting roles, from a bumbling Michael Pena to an ""on autopilot"" T.I., plus it's good to see Anthony Mackie as Falcon in a creative, pretty funny matchup with the Ant-Man himself.<br/><br/>But don't go thinking this film is one of the stronger offerings in the franchise. It's not. In fact, 'Ant-Man' feels like it was created just for the sake of giving Rudd's Scott Lang a starring role just so he could make it into other films ('Captain America: Civil War' and 'Avengers: Endgame' come to mind).<br/><br/>'Ant-Man' should be enjoyed for what it is - a fun, wild ride in a modern 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' kind of way."

","In the never-ending array of superheroes feeding into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to support such franchises like Captain America and The Avengers, it can be difficult to make some of the B-tier and C-tier heroes seem interesting enough to devote a whole movie to them. To ensure each movie feels different from its predecessors, certain unique attributes must be applied. Whether it's the sci-fi-themed Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) or the mind-bending visuals of Doctor Strange (2016), each film requires a gimmick to make it work. For Ant-Man (2015), it's comedy.<br/><br/>If you approach Ant-Man as a standard superhero film, you're likely to be disappointed. There are almost too many off-hand references to much of the MCU to make anyone not familiar with the vast array of movies lost and confused. Plus, the hero's ""origin story"" in Ant-Man is almost par for the course. However, if you watch this film with the understanding that it's more similar to comedy/caper/heist films than a superhero film, you're likely to be satisfied. From Michael Peña's third-party information chains to some of the physical comedy involved with the ants, the movie is fun to watch.<br/><br/>And while Edgar Wright (of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) and Baby Driver (2017) fame) didn't end up directing this movie, his influence in the screenplay is certainly recognizable. Of course, Ant-Man also owes a debt of gratitude to other ""shrinking"" films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), just as much as it owes to Bokeh photography and any number of heist films (like Ocean's Eleven (2001)). Sure, CGI made much of this film possible, but without the ridiculous nature of a shrunken world infused into the plot, it would have been more boring than fun.<br/><br/>A fun little movie for fans of comedy and heists, I give Ant-Man 4.0 stars out of 5."

","I did not honestly expect this movie to be so visually stunning and the whole shrinking and expanding looks so good on screen! one heck of an amazing superpower. and boy, was it hilarious. Michael pena is a comic legend. his jukebox style story narration had me in stitches, it was too good to handle! overall, the movie is ideal for taking little kids, they would have a lot of fun with the awesome visuals, and the adults would have a great time with the humor and again the visuals! so basically, everybody who watches this movie, especially together, since there is no romance scenes which would have made it awkward, the entire family, from kids to grandparents would have fun watching this movie. what more could a film achieve? stellar job, marvel!"

","The movie starts very slow and that is why I believe many gave up on it before it got interesting and took pace. The first 20 minutes are boring and way longer than they need to be, but I guess that is the main and only issue. Otherwise, the casting chosen for the movie fits the bill perfectly, Paul Rudd fits so well with the other Marvel superheroes and Avengers that is astonishing how well they know who to choose to play their heroes. I always liked Michael Douglas and I was so happy when I saw him here cause right away I knew he was going to play an important role. Lilly is a well known actor from her days with Lost and many other movies so it was a no brainer to be aware of her acting capability. The CGI was over the top because every time Scott shrinked into The Ant-Man it felt natural, as natural as it can be. Altho it is obvious it is artificial, still it looks so well blended with the real parts of the movie( most of all I likes the interactions that Ant-Man was making with the ants all the time). The antagonist was also great with an awesome looking suit, altho maybe I would like a bit more screen time with fighting(also that fight with Falcon was a very positive surprise)"

If you like action and comedy genre, you should watch this movie for me, Ant-man is the best movie, of the world, the story is so good, this film has a big budget. The distribution is great. The Ant-man is a film by marvel. The creator of the marvel play in the movie in a short moment. The friend of the principal actor speaks extremely fast and it's funny.

","Ant-Man is good it has good stuff in the movie but there are flaws ht instantly make it a 7/10 for me.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
The whole movie felt rushed.
They give Hope a character arc and they resolve it after 40 minutes, they don't even develop Hope as a character, she just is mad at Hank for not telling the truth and all that and then Hank talks to her for awhile and all is resolved.
Scott is a decent character he goes through a decent character having a clear goal that is personal and he cant achieve that goal cause of his background so he has to change which is a pretty good character arc in my opinion.<br/><br/>CGI
The CGI is the best part in this movie.
How it looks when Ant-Man is small is very good and when Ant-Man fought Cross looked beautiful.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain is horrible.
He has a trashy motivation that is to sell the yellow jacket for money.
He has no development at all he is just this lousy villain that cant be taken serious.<br/><br/>VERDICT

","I did not have high expectations for this movie, I certainly wasn't to excited or I would have found a way to see it sooner than two years after it came out. Usually low expectations make it easier to like a movie, it is much easier to meet or exceed low expectations than high ones.<br/><br/>I don't need non stop action a plot with huge implications, save the world, huge revenge motive, or whatever, to like a movie. In fact I often like what I call ""small movies"" with fewer special effects or huge cultural significance or whatever, but just have a good story to tell and some interesting characters. <br/><br/>Ant man was an interesting character in the comic books, but I am certainly not a fanboy who is going to criticize the movie for some minor detail differences from the source material, it just wasn't translated well to the big screen like Thor, The Hulk, or Iron Man. My problem with the movie is that it didn't really succeed as a comic book movie with bigger than life stories, villain and action, and it was pretty boring as a plot and character based movie as well. I don't even mind cliched and formulaic if well done, this one is cliched and formulaic, but it is not well done. The five stars I gave it are probably a little generous."
"chestern-80136","6","0","1","1 February 2018"," Unfortunately standard, with hints of brilliance.
","This review was previously posted on my blog, so sorry if bits don't make sense on another site! <br/><br/>Recently, I've been watching the MCU films again. This is mostly due to the run-up to Avengers 3. I haven't felt the need to do reviews for most of them, but since my last post was semi-related to this film, I thought I might as well review it.<br/><br/>As mentioned in my previous post, Edgar Wright was briefly involved in this film. As a fan of his work, this naturally elevates the film for me. While I can't know exactly what the director was involved with, you can still clearly see his fingerprints on the finished product. The editing is also brilliant at times, keeping the pacing of the film quick. A great soundtrack is present, and some comedy moments actually work, unlike my usual experience with recent Marvel movies. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the OST is a disappointment. This seems to be a frequent problem with most Marvel films. Can you, dear reader, remember an original song from a Marvel film? The only one people seem to be consistent with is the Avengers theme, which is rather odd; you have a cast of such varied and unique characters, and the music could really reflect that. Instead, songs feel like they could be taken from one film and added to another, and nobody would notice a difference.<br/><br/>The cinematography is decent enough. There's rarely anything mind-blowing. Most of the highlights come from various jokes relating to the ever-changing size of the protagonist. Sharp cuts to reveal how mediocre the events occurring actually are happen frequently, and almost always to great effect.<br/><br/>The dialogue was middling. The film falls into a painful trap, where the mentor character dumps a full scene of exposition onto our uneducated protagonist. It's rather frustrating given the fact that most viewers have already pieced the plot together. We don't need a recap. Also, there's various moments where lines are clumsily delivered. I don't know it's that's due to the actors or the writers, but regardless, parts simply don't work.<br/><br/>The actors in this film are also interesting. There's very few poor performances, but at the same time, the writing can often let people down. Evangeline Lily is probably the most consistent of the performers, and Corey Stoll (ignoring the dodgy dialogue and poor writing) is perfectly fine as our antagonist.<br/><br/>Also, rather oddly, the film seems to slip between originality and cliches rather easily. Ant-Man relishes in the standard scenes of a 'shrunken person' film, with small things being scarier, almost being stepped on and apocalyptic baths all being present. At the same time, however, moments are peculiarly mature. The protagonist isn't much of a hero. He's a convicted criminal who's just gotten out of jail. His partner has separated from him, and found a new lover, who is now acting as the father figure for their child. When I first watched the film, I expected it to end with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd)'s wife realising she really loves our protagonist, and has done all along. They'd get back together, and Scott would get full custody of his child again etc. Instead, it takes a far more mature route, and Scott finds a romantic interest of his own, while still remaining on good terms with his previous partner and her new lover.<br/><br/>Typically, the film has quite a few random issues. There's a jarring absence of blood, despite characters being shot. There's also moments where it's clear we're meant to be feeling some sort of emotion (and perhaps I'm just a sociopath) but I felt little to nothing at the 'sad moments'. Also, the villain is simply awful. Again, however, this is annoyingly common with Marvel movies. Still, was a villainous Jeff Bezos the best they had to offer?<br/><br/>The film is ultimately bland, but perfectly serviceable. It's an incredibly average Marvel movie, with depressing glimpses of real inspiration. I'll give it a 6/10. If you're a Marvel fan who's yet to watch it, and are curious as to how important it is to the overarching MCU plot, I imagine you can skip it. The next film in the series, Captain America: Civil War does feature elements of this film, but it's not really mandatory viewing. Still, if you have the time, there are worse ways to spend it."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This time Marvel went small in concept and of course big with CGI effects. I was unaware that Ant-Man was a comic book character until this movie came out. The high level plot is a wise old scientist and his underling grapple with the moral uses of a shrinking suit and person technology. When the suit technology falls into the wrong hands, a seemingly regular Joe gets recruited to steal it back. Throw in a father-daughter relationship conundrum and the ubiquitous shout out to Iron Man (that guy seems to be referenced in all Marvel movies) and those are the shallow plot points that are the bases for the special effect. Effects that are really good. Lots of clever shrinkage scenarios around kids toys and other everyday happenings. Turn off your brain and watch this movie for the fun effects, light humor, silly tone and to see if Ant-Man will save the day."

","Ant-Man promises much but doesn't deliver. Probably the weakest link of every Marvel movie ever made... It depends too much on special effects and there isn't the wit we are used to in other Marvel movies. A likable next door neighbor kind of guy that is a hero in disguise is a recipe that has been delivering for some time but the special 'X factor' we look forward to in a hero just isn't there. And I'm not blaming the actor's performance, I'm blaming the poor writing. Too much time was spent around a computer making sure the special effects were spot on but not that much time was spent writing a believable story that every fan would like to watch.<br/><br/>5 out of 10.

","After watching Marvel's Avengers - Age Of Ultron and Guardians Of The Galaxy, of which I was a little less than bowled over by, I was hesitant to watch this film. I knew this had the potential to be a brilliantly visual masterpiece - which it was. It was also a well thought out story filled with interesting characters and well-shot scenes, both innovative and ingenious.<br/><br/>Marvel needed this film to breathe fresh air into its universe.<br/><br/>Though it's not the Hank Pym Ant-Man that I remembered out of the back pages of the Hulk comic of my youth it still held up to the comic's feel and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Writers, Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Paul Rudd create a good and solid story around this Ant-Man's origin and the threat which the Ant-Man tech could produce. It could also be that the personality of Scott Lang (Ant-Man) is so steadfast and credible is that Paul Rudd who portrayed him also co-wrote the screenplay. I've never been a great fan of Rudd's as I've found his previous work could either hit (Role- Models) or miss (Admission) - this is definitely some of his better work, and he adds quite a bit to the character and atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>Even the rest of the cast do a brilliant job with their characters. I especially liked Bobby Cannavale as Paxton, Scott's ex-wife's new man... and cop! He adds a nice dynamic to Scott's personal life as he loves Maggie and Cassie (Scott's ex and daughter) and tries to give Scott the benefit of the doubt, even though he's an ex-con. Then there's Michael Pena who is outstanding as Luis. It was nice to see Evangelina Lilly in a decent roll and she carried off the role of Pym's estranged daughter, Hope Van Dyne, admirably. She should make a brilliant Wasp in the upcoming sequel.<br/><br/>The other star of this film is the Director, Peyton Reed, who seems to effortlessly weave CGI and reality together. The scenes where Scott pops from miniature to actual size while fighting could have been so bad but thanks to the direction and the animators they're believable and very effective. Reed is also good at switching pace to give his audience a roller-coaster ride of a movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are superb and seamless - respect due to all involved. And it is truly wonderful that Thomas the Tank Engine is finally breaking into the big time.<br/><br/>This film is a must for all comic book and action movie lovers alike. If you've not hopped into the Marvel universe yet this is one hell of a good place to start... though it may make the rest of the films look a little pale by comparison. This is one film I will watch again... and again..."
"MaximumMadness","8","0","1","1 December 2016"," ""Ant-Man""- A fantastically entertaining entry in the ever-growing Marvel Universe, even if it is a slave to formula...
","One of the more interesting things about Marvel's ever-expanding Cinematic Universe is the ability to take second-tier characters that people have barely heard of and generate pretty consistent high- quality adaptations that wow audiences and bring in droves of new fans and supporters. Whether it be with the deliciously subversive ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", the mind-melting fantasy adventure ""Doctor Strange"" or indeed 2015's highly entertaining heist-thriller ""Ant- Man."" Marvel knows how to spin the most peculiar of properties into gold. Not only is ""Ant-Man"" a strong entry into the overall franchise, but it's also one of the most endearing and entertaining chapters yet, even if it can be a slave to formulaic storytelling at times.<br/><br/>Comedic actor Paul Rudd stars as Scott Lang, a genius burglar whose just gotten out of prison and is seeking to escape his life of crime so that he can become a part of his young daughter's life again. However, monetary worries forces him to pull that fabled ""one last job"", which he soon discovers is really a test orchestrated by brilliant scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who is seeking a protégé to take on the mantle of the ""Ant-Man""... a superhero-like figure with the ability to shrink to the size of an insect that Pym once operated as years prior. He needs a new Ant-Man in order to pull of a heist against his evil former business apprentice Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who is becoming dangerously close to discovering the secret behind Pym's shrinking technology, and cannot be trusted with the immense power it affords. And so, Hank and his beautiful daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) must train Scott to become the new Ant-Man in order to save the day.<br/><br/>The beating heart that helps elevate the film is the wonderful cast and the infectiously entertaining tone that it excels at crafting. Rudd, best known for his comedic turns in numerous television and film roles excels as the endlessly likable Scott Lang, a good- hearted man who got pulled into the seedy underworld of crime but never lost his sense of humor or humanity. I was apprehensive when he was first announced, but within mere seconds of being introduced on-screen, you'll completely be behind him. Douglas adds a great sense of class to the proceedings and makes for a great mentor- figure. Lilly is quite good in her supporting role as Hope, and gives a lot of pathos and emotion as a woman who feels somewhat overlooked and neglected by her father, due to a terrible event from their past together. And Stoll makes for an adequately threatening and increasingly unhinged villain who serves as a sort-of dark contrast to Hope... he too feels abandoned by Pym, but rather than trying to deal with it in a healthy way, obsesses over him and tries to out-do him no matter the stake. Supporting roles by the likes of Judy Greer, Abby Ryder Fortson and Bobby Cannavale are extremely well cast. But special props definitely go to outstanding Michael Peña in a small supporting role as Scott's friend Luis. I won't spoil his character, but suffice to say, he's perhaps the breakout here.<br/><br/>Director Peyton Reed crafts a highly entertaining and surprisingly light and breezy atmosphere that aids greatly in making the film a very good watch. He isn't afraid to deliver the gags and thrills at a mile-a-minute and never feels pressured to bog the film down with needless grit and grime like so many other comic-book adaptations. He allows the film to be a stellar piece of entertainment first and foremost. The expert mixing of the structure of a classic heist caper with the broad elements of comedy give the film's structure and core a very unique and warm feeling. Without a doubt one of the most fun entries in the entire cinematic saga Marvel has thus-far crafted. And despite no longer being involved, you can occasionally catch glimpses of former writer/director Edgar Wright's contributions to the film, which gives it a fun, nerdy flair that fans will surely appreciate. Fear not... despite Wright leaving early on in the production, you still feel his fingerprints during key scenes.<br/><br/>However, despite the praise I've sung, I cannot say it's a film without fault. And the biggest issue here is that it is a movie very much devoted to formula. Even a slave to it. If you're at all familiar with film theory or structure, there won't be too many surprises in store, and it can become a tad predictable in its second and third acts. Even though it can occasionally subvert what you expect, it doesn't do it often enough to feel completely fresh, and it may turn some movie- fans off if they can't disconnect from it and just appreciate the film for it's good humor and grand performances.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it's not an issue in any way for me. Yes, you can see the twists and turns coming from a mile away and the character-arcs are all conspicuously obvious... but the film is too much fun for you to care. You'll get dozens of great laughs by the time the credits role, there's a ton of thrilling and wildly creative action that makes good use of the shrinking-man concept, the roles are all ideally cast with wonderful performers, and there's even some nice heartwarming moments peppered in. Oh, and the funniest (and scariest) children's toy ever, which alone is worth the cost of admission.<br/><br/>All-in-all, while not one of Marvel's absolute best, ""Ant-Man"" is definitely a personal favorite, and it comes highly recommended. Everyone I know who has seen it has adored it (and that includes people in their teens, 20's... all the way up through their 70's!) and it's some of the most fun I've had with a film in the past few years. ""Ant-Man"" is a very good 8 out of 10."

I have found all the films to be pretty great, some not great as others but still pretty good. And now comes the smallest in popularity(other than the Guardians of The Galaxy) Ant-Man! However to fans of the comic universe in Marvel Hank Pym. In this film we get the second Ant-Man, Scott Lang. A con-man trying to get a chance at redemption when the old Ant-Man Hank Pym lets him steal his suit. He become's Scott's mentor so that way Scott can pull of a heist to steal Darren Cross's Yellowjacket and save the world. The movie achieved its goal by introducing Marvels strangest and smallest character in a witty and action packed film filled with great sequences. When Ant-Man is in his small scale you get to see the scope of how big everything around him is. The story is interesting since it's a good heist film(which I don't see often cause Tower Heist sucked) and a shrinking film(which is why it wasn't made in the 80's because of the popularity in Honey I Shrunk the Kids) which is what makes it vastly interesting. The performances are very great especially from Michael Pena who is hilarious and kills it with his humor in every scene he's in. Michael Doglus as Hank Pym is like one of the best performances he's ever done. The direction from Peyton Reed is the best he's done since Down With Love. The film ties itself together in the marvel universe by stopping by a certain facility. It has good wit, characters, acting and the best action sequences since Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I'm giving Ant-Man a five out of five."

","The movie was funny and interesting. Quite enjoyable. However, all those ants grossed me out. Also, the idea is a bit absurd and at times it comes across as such. But in the end during the final fight the movie becomes better. It becomes that super hero movie that everyone expects even though at the begging as I said comes across as quite absurd and childish. It is quite a risky plot in my opinion that started bad and saves itself at the end. <br/><br/>Casting: I don't usually have any criticism when it comes to casting in marvels movies but in this one I just think that Paul Rudd was the right choice. He comes across as quite cold and any attempt to make its character funny fails. So poor performance from Rudd. <br/><br/>Storytelling: very interesting story and very well developed. Its a straight forward story that has a beginning, a middle and an end. The end is anticipated and as expected things don't go as planned but it is not so easy to anticipate what will go wrong which made the movie interesting."

It was good and wholesome entertainment from start to end.<br/><br/>The story was good and easily comprehensible. And it was a nice twist with the cut-over into the Avengers universe, for those whom enjoy that type of superheroes.<br/><br/>What appealed to me in ""Ant-Man"" was the comedy and the offbeat character and unlikely superhero character. That and also the performance by Paul Rudd in this movie, because he really carried the movie quite well. It was also nice to see Michael Douglas back on the screen, as it had been some time since last I saw him. But also Corey Stoll was really well cast for the villainous role.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" has lots of action, subtle comedy, good special effects and good acting performances.<br/><br/>All in all, then I am rating ""Ant-Man"" a solid seven out of ten stars."

","Loved this movie. Marvel has shown consistently that you can have comedy in super-hero movies and still have them be taken seriously. Humor is essential to super-hero stories. The very idea of costumed vigilantes is funny. Don't ignore the inherit humor. This movie is clearly another hit for Marvel. The only thing that bugged me, pun intended, is that Hope van Dyne looked a lot like Laura Calvin Miller from The Santa Clause. I mean, her hair and even some of her facial expressions matched up. Did anyone else notice this and do I have an unhealthy fascination with Wendy Crewson. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187724/mediaviewer/rm3007221248"

","I know Ant-Man well. I remember when he first started out in the comic book TALES TO ASTONISH, before he began popping pills to alternate between being Ant-Man and Giant Man. Much like Iron Man, Ant Man was a comic book hero not quite popular enough to merit manning an entire comic book by himself. He would share TALES TO ASTONISH with other super heroes who would come and go.<br/><br/>The surprise is how well Iron Man and Ant-Man lend themselves to cinema. Iron Man is a perfect representative of the digital age which may yet indeed foster upon us mechanical men of all kinds and sizes. Iron Man lends himself to interesting CGI effects much more easily than almost any of the other characters with the exception of Thor and the realm of Asgard.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is another matter entirely. An original member of the Avengers primarily as Giant Man, it was hard for me to imagine viable directions for his character to go. When the Hulk left the Avengers and later fought them to a standstill along with the Fantastic Four, it was Ant-Man and his squadrons of ants who put a stop to all the mayhem and carnage once and for all. It was admittedly a novel twist, how the smallest and supposedly least significant of creatures could stop a thundering behemoth who was the strongest thing walking the Earth; i.e., The Incredible Hulk.<br/><br/>This film improves upon the Ant-Man myth in a number of ways. First of all, this film has the look and feel of the original comic book sans all that 'dark edge' stuff that is really designed to satisfy the sensibilities of adults who have hijacked the Comic Book medium for their own needs and agendas. This movie is an Action Comedy and feels and acts more kid friendly. Michael Douglas lends the gravitas of a great actor to the role of Hank Pym, who as the original Ant-Man becomes the mentor to the Ant-Man to be, Scott Lang, as played by Paul Rudd. Scott is no esteemed scientist, but rather a high-tech computer thief recently released from San Quentin. Therefore we have the High and the Low at work in this current adventure story.<br/><br/>While Ant-Man goes through all his shrinking and enlarging, the plot itself goes through convolutions and permutations on smaller and larger scales and gives a subtle nod to an earlier film called THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN. I found the homage to this film, as lighthearted as it was, something that gave this ANT-MAN just that extra layer of awe and wonder making Scott Lang's Hero's Journey much more evocative in its sophistication. Baby boomers like myself could feel included in the reach of its appeal, even as ANT-MAN began its mission of putting the COMIC back in the term Comic Book Superhero. <br/><br/>As in, this is for kids and adults...<br/><br/>That doesn't mean ANT-MAN comes across as camp particularly. It is a snappy, fast-paced adventure reminiscent of BACK TO THE FUTURE and whizzes in and out of the realms of relativistic physics and quantum mechanics with a knowing verve and assurance that gasps and chuckles at itself. The cinematographer Russell Carpenter is to be commended for the look and the feel of the piece as is the veritable army of an Art Department that gave this film its allure. <br/><br/>The quips and wise-cracking in the face of danger are all back and this Ant-Man is all that a Marvel Superhero should be. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket proves a particularly compelling multi-layered villain. Evangeline Lily is also attractive and exciting as the estranged daughter of Henry Pym, Hope Van Dyne, while Michael Pena and his boys bring up the rear and do street with the comic relief. So the cinema is proving to be a medium that can grant new life and viable evolution to even the most diminutive of heroes, just like it proved to be for one Dark Knight."
"xamtaro","6","0","1","24 May 2016"," contorted into child friendly comedy and shrunk down to superficial super heroics with no sense of peril or tension.
","At 11 movies into its interconnected series of comic book live action movies, marvel studios has cemented its fool proof formula since AVENGERS: lots of laughs, simplistic stories, superficial thrills, and more laughs. The deeper themes of earlier marvel movies be damned. Comedy sells and they have cranked that up for ANT MAN. Number 11 in the marvel comics series of movie adaptations. From the massive scope of countrywide destruction in AGE OF ULTRON, marvel tones it down and goes small. Way small. Small in scope, tone, depth and small in the way of fresh ideas.<br/><br/>Incorporating the most groan inducing aspects of the marvel formula, ant man is essentially the shrinking blue collar Iron Man. We have seen this story countless times. The comedic lovable loser down on his luck, trying his darnedest to be a good man and Father to his kid, he gets a godsend opportunity to turn his life around and sticks it to some big shot corporate dude. Meet Scott Lang, ex-master thief looking to turn away from a life of crime. His caricature of a friend tempts him for one more burglary to rob an inventor but Scott ends up discovering a secret invention: an incredible suit belonging to bitter inventor Hank Pym that is able to shrink its user to the size of an Ant. Where Scott sees a horrible mistake, The elderly Hank sees opportunity to outsmart a former protégé Darren cross who had ousted Pym from his own company and created the weaponised ""yellow jacket"" mech suit incorporating pym's shrinking tech. Now Scott lang is given his second chance to be a hero. He breaks out of captivity using his shrinking suit, teams with hank and his Daughter Hope to master its capabilities, and attempts to take down the power hungry Cross who is close to perfecting the yellow jacket weapon.<br/><br/>Remember what I said about small stakes and scope? Ant Man is not about some international incident or some earth shattering invasion. It is a personal and very focused story and that's fine actually. But what causes a terrible dissonance is the way the humour is handled. True to such movies, we have characters in constant life or death situations but they seem to be treating their plight like a playground outing or a pillow fight. Jokes, snarky banter and badly timed comedy abounds without any sense of peril or desperation making it difficult to take the plot seriously. <br/><br/>Or perhaps one isn't supposed to take it seriously? After all, the plot in itself is a mash up of Honey I Shrunk the Kids with some Adam Sandler style comedy. I mean there is this one part where Scott enlarges a pre-shrunken tank and escapes from his pursuers. A tank! But even looking at it from an action comedy perspective still presents some problems. It's not Witty enough to pass as a comedy, Nor thrilling enough as an action movie. <br/><br/>To his credit, director Peyton Reed does some amazing work with the shrinking scenes and the fight scenes involving our pint sized protagonist are definitely a work of special effects genius. Paul Rudd successfully captures the plight of poor Scott lang with a very earnest performance, though at times overdoing the jokes a bit. The score by Christophe Beck is also of particular note, eschewing the increasingly clichéd action Beats of past marvel scores for something closer to a 1960s spy thriller. <br/><br/>In the greater scheme of things, ANT MAN presents many intriguing concepts,l. Big ideas that were hampered by small minded execution and equally small minded reliance on cheap comedy belittling what could have been intelligent storytelling with cliché at ter cliché. A sprightly little movie that would be right at home as a family comedy if you took out the shrinking. <br/><br/>************Review End**********"

","I'm a massive fan of the Marvel Universe and have been so impressed with all the films thus far, but this one didn't really appeal to me as much when it came out. How wrong was I?!<br/><br/>I've just recently seen the newest Captain America: Civil War - if you've not seen it yet then delay no further because its an awesome film - and wanted to get myself up to date on the backstory of the only other Marvel film I hadn't yet seen. I went in with mild expectations, I mean how could a film about a superhero ant be awesome? But I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The film incorporated an excellent mix of wonderful visuals, a fantastic origin story and the usual (awesome) Marvel humor to make for an enjoyable watch. Don't get me wrong, this one is (even more than the others) targeted at kids but don't let it put you off. Even if you're not a kid anymore, you'll still find yourself glued to the screen."

","While the last Avengers movie was the more popular of the two Marvel movies that came out last year, Ant Man is the better choice. Lots of humor, great casting, and excellent special effects. It's much shorter than Ultron and doesn't drag along. I missed it in theatres yet got to see it on Bluray and saw what everyone was raving about. My favorite character from the movie has to be Evangeline Lilly, who is hot. She will play a pivotal roll in the next movie, while Paul Rudd's character will be in the next Captain America movie. Kids will enjoy the movie as much as their parents. If you get to catch it on Starz, do it. You will not be disappointed."

I am not a die hard Marvel comic fan so this was my first real experience of ant man and I was not disappointed. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, whether you like the Marvel franchise or not it is an amazing film! The CGI and effects were incredible and really helped make the film come alive. A well written script that really introduced Ant man to the world quite nicely!"

","Ant man was a nice movie and new character adding to Marvel. Movie started well showing and creating a proper background for creating Antman superhero, showing Antman to familiarize with all the type of ants which exist in the ground and controlling them was good storyline in the movie. Evangeline Lilly looks amazing in the movie , but would have been good to see her in the action as well, however end of the movie its was shown that a dress was created for her by the parents, so we can expect her to be in action in the sequel of Antman.

","Ant-Man was a breath of old but new fresh air. To me it feels like a present day Marvel Universe, phase one movie. What I mean by that is it was an introduction movie like Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor alike, yet it was set in the present day of the Marvel Universe. So, post events of Age of Ultron. To me, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Paul Rudd played Scott Lange brilliantly, embodying the sarcastic joker that Ant-Man is known for yet still playing the role of a loving and caring father. The comedic point of this movie was on point where I found myself laughing at every line Scott would belt out and especially Michael Peña's character of Luis. Actually, the entire heist crew was an all around riot to witness on screen between Rudd, Peña, T.I. (Dave), and Dastmalchian (Kurt). Comedy aside, the action was just right for how I like my superhero movies. The effects were brilliant to me and this film was one of my favorite 3D movies to date. Overall, an enjoyable film as Marvel continues to knock movies out of the park and continues to make the inner comic geek in me so happy with characters I have grown to love and continue loving in their new present day adaptations."
"Wuchakk","8","0","2","19 April 2016"," Ant-Man?
","Released in 2015, ""Ant-Man"" stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who is offered redemption and the opportunity to be a hero. Michael Douglas plays his mentor, Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly Pym's daughter; meanwhile Corey Stoll co-stars as the heavy.<br/><br/>In my vast arsenal of old comics I have only one issue where Ant-Man is the main star: Marvel Feature #10, which featured Hank Pym as the hero, not to mention his wife, the Wasp, AKA Janet van Dyne. The character's run in that comic ceased with that very issue. By the 80s Scott Lang, a good-intentioned thief, became Ant-Man after stealing Pym's Ant-Man suit to save his daughter. With the encouragement of Pym, Lang became Ant-Man full-time.<br/><br/>The movie is based on these events and I was surprised at how entertaining it is considering how relatively minor the hero is. The movie even makes a joke about this when Ant-Man comes face-to-face with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Speaking of which, it's great to see the Falcon in action. It's also great to see Yellowjacket who, in the comics, was Hank Pym after Lang took over as Ant-Man. In the movie Yellowjacket is the villain (Stoll), which is okay since Pym's Yellowjacket in the comics sort of became a villain when he had a mental breakdown and was eventually divorced by Janet, the Wasp. The filmmakers incidentally did an excellent job with the Yellowjacket suit.<br/><br/>""Ant-Man"" was a surprise hit at the box office and understandably so. It's a quality superhero flick done with style and brimming with confidence. It's nothing more than this, but that's all it needs to be. It's nice to see Michael Douglas who was, believe-it-or-not, 70 years-old during shooting. He shines in the movie as Pym and could easily pass for ten years younger. I also really liked the Quantum Realm sequence when Lang is reduced to microscopic size.<br/><br/>The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Georgia and San Francisco, CA.

","I do not know anything about Ant- man, but from what they showed on the commercials, I thought it was stupid. Sometimes when they show too little trailers on TV, it looks stupid and makes you think it is not good. My husband and I saw it on TV because we thought it would be a waste of money at the movies and was iffy about wanting to watch it. Still a little leary of it, we decided to take a chance on it and enjoyed it. It was humorous when he tries to become Ant- man. I liked it. I also like it that all the Marvel movies are connected in a way and quips about the Avengers or any of the other characters are funny.

I see a movie, Doctor Strange, who I never heard of, but it's coming out in 2016 so in a couple of months. I'm mostly excited about Black Panther. It would be cool if they put Gambit in a movie and they did put him in a movie, X-MEN: Origins Wolverine.

","Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.<br/><br/>I might be in the minority, but I think this is the best film in the Marvel universe yet, or at least in a long time. As the films got bigger, they became more crowded, more full of action, and more full of computer-generated fluff. This film returns to a script, with a solid set of characters. There is still action (because it's a superhero film), but it does not overwhelm the picture.<br/><br/>Also, Paul Rudd makes for a great hero. What Marvel has done well is casting actors who add a light and humorous element, even during universe-altering stories.

We all expect the villain to escape just when things were going well and then return with the super weapon so we can have the final battle to save the world. But one has to suspend disbelief when the hero turns his back on the villain who is just standing around waiting to shoot everyone, just to pamper a buddy who got an owie. What a shame.

"one9eighty","7","0","2","6 April 2016"," Tiny hero with a big heart
","Another movie from the Marvel cinematic universe. This one is directed by Payton Reed and written by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. Starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang and Michael Douglas as Dr Hank Pym. <br/><br/>Scott Lang (Rudd) is a failure in life, he's fresh out of prison, he cant get a job and he's losing his family. He's convinced to do one more big job which will help him out of the slum he's in. Lang inadvertently stumbles upon and steals a super suit which when worn shrinks him down to the size of an ant, giving him the super senses and abilities of the insect too. It turns out that Pym (Douglas) has set Lang up and orchestrated the theft because he sees something in Lang which will help him. Corporate espionage and corruption is afoot, Pym's own company is being threatened and corrupted from the inside and Pym wants Lang to help put an end to it and prevent the bad guys from getting hold of his suit and his scientific advances. <br/><br/>I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as other Marvel films, truth be told even in the comic world I thought Pym and Lang were pretty lame and never truly enjoyed their story arcs. I think this film was done well though, Rudd played Lang as likable albeit unlucky and Douglas did well playing Dr Hank Pym. While not entirely true to the comic books this film was a good introduction to Pym and Lang and is well worth a watch. There is a brief mention of Pym's wife Janet Van Dyne who was one of the original Avengers like Pym was (keep an eye open in 2018 for a follow up to this penned as ""Ant-man and The Wasp""). Van Dyne was the Wasp to Pym's Ant Man/ Giant Man/ Yellowjacket. In this film she is lost in space having shrunk to sub-sub atomic size with no way of getting back. On the topic of Yellowjacket, there is an interesting twist as the bad guy in this film is Yellowjacket which in the comics was an alter ego Pym took up in later story arcs. In this film the Yellowjacket is played by Corey Stoll's character Darren Cross, his corporate enemy. I won't go on about Yellowjacket though as I'm a Marvel fan and I don't want to be seen sulking about comic to film differences. <br/><br/>It's funny and entertaining and packed with action. The CGI doesn't let the film down and the fight scenes where Ant Man is shrinking and growing all come across as exciting and creative. Even the giant ants (when Lang is in his shrunken state) look authentic enough). More of a family film than some of the other Marvel films with a pace which keeps you hooked but without breaking too much of a sweat. It's difficult to directly compare this to other Marvel movies as it feels fresh and unique in comparison. I'd absolutely recommend watching it as it makes a great way to pass the time. An easy 7 out of 10 for this."

","Welcome to the world of marvel comics where whatever is presented is the reality. In that world, lives a guy who can become like an ant and command them as well. The more he does it, the better he becomes and thus a movie is born from the classic comic world. I read Ant-man growing up and never dreamed I would see the day where it would be a movie. Wow. There are some parts in the movie that come across to me as corny and annoying but not from Ant-Man but his buddy boys. I suppose they had to include it to keep the movie modern and from getting too serious plus it gives them a way to make the story-line more plausible. It reminded me a little of Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars. An appearance is allowed but not too much screen time as it takes away. The acting gives us reason to consider the subject reasonably but the special effects steal the show. Not only that, but exploring the microcosm world and coming back from it opens up some really interesting possibilities as that world must exist in order for this one to exist. The movie starts out a little slow, perhaps off the mark, but at some point gels and that is when it become interesting almost to the point of glue as it sticks to you and you want it to. Kudos to how they explain Ant-Mans start-up, his powers and how the Ants want a serious player or they don't listen. You swallow every detail because you want to know what Ant-Man can do and then you want to see him do it. Popcorn for sure or finger foods your call. A tasty drink and a sweet snack a must.

","Total Enthrallment! Marvel Studio must of had their A-Team working on this one, hard to discern any obvious faults without hen-pecking it from every angle. I usually loathe these.....""Comic Book Movies"", however, ""Ant Man"" somehow came together near perfectly, making for a profoundly entertaining, ultra high-tech thrill-ride of a movie. Let's state a few important facts about the movie, great casting (especially the lead villain), mind-bending special effects that are among the best looking yet to be seen, first-rate digital cinematography captures every frame with stunning clarity and detail, the editing is often complex and intriguingly captivating (as it REALLY does tend to draw you into the movie) especially during the action scenes - of which there are many. Great to see an aging Michael Douglas in first-rate movie, as it's been quite a while since I could say that. This movie does a great job of depicting out-of-control megalomania, combined with the bleeding-edge of high-tech and with world conquest being the end-game. The lead villain is brilliantly portrayed, as are most of the other key players. As stated earlier it's hard to find any significant faults (or minor faults for that matter) during the course of this frenetically paced 2-hour movie. It's action-packed, but, unlike most movies of this type, they actually slow it down from time to time and let plot breath in between the murder and mayhem. Yes, there's actually a discernible plot threaded through this movie - and that's a very good thing; as most comic book movie are completely and utterly dunderheaded affairs.<br/><br/>I've had this theory for several years now, and it's this: I suspect the nations collective IQ is slowly being eroded by the sheer amount of (painfully moronic!) comic book movies, that are constantly being thrown our way, invading both big screens and small screen alike. In the world of film, they are the video game equivalent (especially when there's fakey-looking CGI nonsense on every other frame). It seems like there's a new comic book flick out every single month nowadays and it's stomach-turning, though I'm pretty numbed to their presence by now. ""Oh look, another piece of s*** comic book movie"" is my typical inner monologue, when my TV is momentarily taken over by yet another obnoxious movie preview.<br/><br/>.......But, ANT MAN is the rare exception and it could not be more highly recommended by this viewer. I fondly remember seeing Ant Man, and that sure as hell was one confoundingly entertaining first-viewing. A word of advice, don't reduce this mesmerizing movie, by watching it on a PC monitor, watch on your flat-screen TV, anything less then 40 inches is insulting to this modern spectacle of cinematic high-art.<br/><br/>There, so have I sold you? Ant Man fricking rocks!"
"Aaron1375","9","0","3","28 March 2016"," Ant-man bursts onto the big screen, then shrinks...
","Finally able to watch this Marvel movie and now I am all caught up again as far as films in the Marvel universe are concerned. After watching it though, I have to say I wish I had seen this one on the big screen and in 3D as it looks like some of the scenes would have looked really good in 3D. For reasons I cannot remember now though, I never got around to seeing it, and it took me awhile to finally catch it on DVD. This is mainly due to the fact Disney always charges high prices for all their films which is kind of the downside to them owning any movie property as they, like the gaming company Nintendo does also, will almost never drop the price of their merchandise. Fortunately, a friend let me borrow it and I have to say the film was really good. I would say that it is more action than comedy, but there are a lot of funny scenes in this one. The action is pretty good too and it was nice seeing Michael Douglas in a significant role. They always manage to nab a solid actor for their films, like Robert Redford in Captain America: Winter Soldier. This film was a nice way to end the night as I watched another film that was good today too, but the ending was a downer.<br/><br/>The story has a convict trying to reform his ways which proves to be difficult because he is friends who only seem to know how to do crimes. Meanwhile, Dr. Hank Pym is shocked to learn that a man he once mentored is close to replicating his invention, a substance that can close or expand the molecules between atoms. Thus, it can cause things to grow and shrink. Dr. Pym even has suit that allows this to happen without any adverse effects on the wearer as long term exposure to the agent seems to cause neurological damage and it is becoming evident that the man he mentored is experiencing these problems. Pym enlists the aid of the convict much to the dismay of Pym's daughter that wishes to use the suit herself to grab the Yellow Jacket suit. One that the man Pym once mentored wishes to sell to the highest bidder once he has perfected the shrinking agent.<br/><br/>The movie was really good as was the cast and Marvel continues making really good films. I actually like this film more than the Avengers: Age of Ultron as it was different. That film felt familiar to me, as the layout of the film mirrored the first Avenger film a bit too much. This one just felt fresher to me than that film. The next Captain America also looks to be better than the previous Avengers film and more epic as well. This one was not really epic, more of a fun action film that one would expect considering the hero in it. They did change things around, but it is just par for the course, every comic film changes a few things. Here the main thing is Pym is no longer the one who is in the Ant-man costume during the film, but he did use it in the past.<br/><br/>So another very good Marvel film and now I am all caught up and ready to see Captain America: Civil War. Though, this film was not really necessary for that film other than a couple of scenes here and there. It was cool seeing Falcon in a small role, but I guess his role was larger than Ant-man's! Ha! The film is set up to have a sequel and the daughter looks like she is going to be taking on a role herself. I kind of guessed that she might, but was not entirely sure until the scene once the credits role. The one really good thing about watching these movies on DVD is that I do not have to sit through a ton of credits to get to an extra scene or two. No, with a DVD I can just speed through them! So another fun Marvel film that sets up yet another hero in their universe."

The size play was flawless, detailed and didn't get too much to handle.<br/><br/>The cast was awesome but Michael Pena was a stand out for me with his hilarious retelling of the tipoffs he received and I was a little apprehensive about Paul Rudd, I thought he was going to turn the comedy stupid and go over the top but it had a nice balance of funny and serious.<br/><br/>Loved the cameos including of course, Stan Lee, loved the mention of what happened in Avengers: Age of Ultron, little bread crumbs for future Ant-Man films and even a little nod to a certain web slinger!<br/><br/>I would be interested to read or hear how this movie differed from Edgar Wright's version of the film but they still managed to move past all that drama and make a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>Loved this, will see it again in the cinemas, buy it on blu-ray on Day 1 and will be eagerly waiting for, hopefully, some sequels!<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the MCU, go see this!<br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE: There is a mid credits scene AND an after credits scene!"

So, as I have stated and proved. Yes. Paul Rudd is sexy... symbol.<br/><br/>As far as this movie is concerned. The tie-ins to multiple future movies within this franchise will boggle the mind.

","After a three year stretch in San Quentin, brilliant cat-burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) attempts to go straight, but when he is fired from his job at Baskin Robbins, his criminal pals talk him into a potentially lucrative safe-cracking job that leads to the discovery of a special high-tech suit capable of shrinking a man to the size of an ant while increasing his speed and strength<br/><br/>I grew up reading DC Comics rather than Marvel, but the DC cinematic universe has disappointed me far more than it has impressed: in particular, I found the Nolan Batman films and Snyder's Superman movie overtly serious in tone, visually dreary and consequently rather dull. In contrast, the majority of Marvel's superhero films have been colourful, exciting, and, most importantly, a lot of fun. Despite a troubled production, Ant-man also manages to be all of these things.<br/><br/>It might seem like a minor movie in the MCU when compared to the X-Men and Avengers films, which are far broader in scope, but Ant-man succeeds in delivering the requisite action and spectacle, as well as some much needed humour. The script, from Joe Cornish and Edgar Wright, is full of light-hearted moments that acknowledge the silliness of the whole concept, and director Peyton Reed keeps things moving along at a decent pace. The film also ties in nicely with the Avengers series with a neat scene in which Ant-man meets (and beats) Falcon (Anthony Mackie).<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the incredible effects, best of all being the de-ageing of Michael Douglas."
"Wizard-8","Null","0","1","23 January 2016"," Best reserved for when you're in an undemanding mood
","I avoided ""Ant-Man"" when it played in theaters for several reasons. One reason was that this particular superhero seemed minor league compared to most others. Another reason was that quite frankly, I am starting to get tired of superhero movies. There have been so many over the past few years that it's starting to get a bit too much.<br/><br/>Anyway... I finally watched it today after finding a copy at my local library. And after watching it, I can say I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater, and I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see it on Blu-ray. Before I go any further, I will admit that I didn't hate or really dislike it. There have been worse movies I've seen, superhero-related or not. It's not boring, for one thing, despite being almost two hours long. There are some good special effects, and some decent action sequences.<br/><br/>Yet at the same time, the movie has a kind of been there, done that kind of feeling. Many of the characters and situations you will have seen before, or see that they've only been given a slight cosmetic change for this particular story. The movie also suffers from a problem many superhero movies have - being forced to go through the long process of showing how the main character became a superhero. This takes a long time, leaving only a limited amount of time to show the superhero after ""graduation"" to be in action. Also, there are some unclear or simply unexplained plot points, like why the cops took so long to confront the Michael Douglas character.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is kind of minor league stuff. Despite its many problems, the movie doesn't really provoke hatred in the viewer. But at the same time, it's missing real spark as well as originality in many areas. Your reaction to the movie will likely be more positive the less you have to pay for watching it, as well as being more positive the less demanding you are feeling at the time."

","'Ant-Man' is part of the Marvel Universe of action fiction, and in fact Stan Lee has his customary cameo in it. We viewed it on BluRay and the picture and sound are first-rate. <br/><br/>The concept is a scientist (Michael Douglas) has developed a technique to shrink the size between atoms some 25 years earlier but shelves it, and in fact denies it, because his protégé has evil intentions for it, making the world a more dangerous place. <br/><br/>But petty criminal, just out of jail and locked out of his young daughter's life, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, gets a chance to climb out of his hole by helping implement a strategy to defeat the evil scientist. To do this he has to put on and learn to use a suit which can convert him, at the press of a button, into Ant-Man, literally the size of an ant but retaining all his power. So in that tiny package his power is more like a super power.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly has a key role as Hope van Dyne, Corey Stoll is good as the evil scientist Darren Cross, and when dressed in his own suit, Yellowjacket.<br/><br/>There are characters from other Marvel stories, like Anthony Mackie who is in such series as The Avengers and Captain America, plus Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter of 'Agent Carter.'<br/><br/>The story is good and often humorous, Rudd is really good in his role, and the movie overall is very entertaining."
"princhu","7","0","3","10 December 2015"," A gorgeous mess.
","I expected nothing from Ant-man. Nothing. To be short, reason being that the MCU movies lately have just lacked depth. They've been less about the people behind the heroes and more about squeezing in fancy graphics and a massive amount of aloof, sleep- inducing action. Though to be fair, the latter is good fan-service for some.<br/><br/>Back to Ant-Man. I felt like something was wrong with the movie as I spent the first 30 minutes wondering whether this was all just a joke but then the uncanny strangeness over it all somehow grabbed hold of and intrigued me so I just stuck with it. I actually got some great laughs out of it, at one point in which I ended up having a terribly painful cramping fit for about a minute. <br/><br/>Here's how it is, you either love it or hate it and it all depends on what your mind-set's like. If you go in there expecting a serious, deep, dark story surrounding the rise of a hero then you'll be effed. No, really, you'll need to look beyond the terrible, cheesy dialogues, silly stereotypes, the changes of cast from the original comics and the errors in the physics to find that little spark, the twinkly- eyedness and have fun with it as a part of something new entirely to join the MCU movie adaptations.<br/><br/>It all culminates in a gorgeous mess playing around with our perception of relativity, using the size of the Ant-Man as a source of fun and interesting problem-solving. Focus too much on what you don't like and you'll miss the lighthearted fun. Who's to say the story of a burdened hero can't be lighthearted too?"

","You'd think this movie would be really weird but Marvel pulls it off! 'Ant-Man' ironically feels smaller than the other Marvel films, which i like. I enjoyed Paul Rudd as the main character Scott Lang. The other characters where well cast, but Evangeline Lily as Hope van Dyne was underused. I think her character could have played a much bigger role in the film.<br/><br/>I liked the humour throughout the movie, to be honest this kind of movie shouldn't take itself too serious, and it didn't. The movie felt self-aware about it's silly parts.

","Review: For a movie about a superhero ant, I actually didn't find it that bad. Michael Douglas plays Dr. Hank Pym who has a unique formula to shrink people and give them superhero strength but the company that he works for, wants to use his experiment for war, so he resigns and builds his own company to further his work. He takes on a protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who votes Hank out of his own company with the help of his daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), who blames her father for her mothers death. Now that the company is under Darren's management, he carries on with Hanks work to try and create the perfect soldier but he's unable to shrink a human being. Hope soon finds out that Darren wants to do bad things with the formula, so she joins forces with her dad but she still works for Darren and she sends her father reports of Darren's progression. As Darren is coming closer to perfecting the formula, Hank has to find a subject to steal his work back from Darren so, with the help of his daughter, they set a trap to see who can break into his house. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) plays a thief who is recently released from jail and lives with his close friend Luis (Michael Pena) who is also a thief. After getting the sack because of his history in jail, Scott hears about a job, from Luis and his new found friends, Dave (T.I.) and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), to rob a wealthy man whose away on business. When they finally manage to get into the massive safe, they only manage to find a suit, which disappoints the criminal crew but Scott still takes the suit and he tries it on when he gets home. He then shrinks to a ant size human but he's unable to control his new powers so Hank talks to him through the suit so he can control his movements. When he turns back to human form, he decides to put the suit back but the cops catch him and put him in jail. The cop whose leading the case, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale), just happens to be his ex-wives boyfriend so Scott knows that he's going to be spending serious time behind bars because he has just recently been released. Scott then gets a visit from a man who poses as his lawyer, Hank, and he gives him some clues about how to break out of jail. He then sneaks the suit into his jail cell and he manages to break free, with the help of some ants and Hank giving him instructions in his ear. When he wakes in Hanks house and he agrees to go through some training so he can control the suit and get into the mind of ants, who will be his handy helpers while he's in ant form. Anyway, Hope puts him through the physical training while Hank is putting together the perfect plan to steal back his work from Darren. Hank soon realises that there going to need some help to get into the heavily guarded building so Scott brings in his friends, Luis, Dave and Kurt, to retrieve Hanks work. Scott manages to get into the building through the water system and Luis poses as a security guard and takes out anyone whose going to disrupt the process. The only problem is that Darren has caught on to what there doing and while he's in the midst of selling the formula for a large amount of money, he captures the culprits and goes ahead with the deal. Ant-Man then uses his new powers and manages to escape and save his friends but Darren has built his own suit and goes toe to toe with Scott in a epic battle. Its quite a detailed storyline which covers many elements of the comic book hero and there are some references to the Avengers who obviously will join forces with Ant-Man at some point. I was a bit sceptical about Paul Rudd playing Ant-Man but he done a good job alongside Michael Douglas. There is enough material to keep the movie interesting but I don't think that we have seen Ant-Man's true powers yet. He has the ability to become a perfect Avenger because of his unique powers, so I think that the best is yet to come. With that aside, I liked Corey Stoll as the villain and Michael Pena and his crew did make me laugh. It wasn't in the same class as the first Iron Man but it's an enjoyable movie which has paved the way for a new type of super hero. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Director, Peyton Reed, 51, done a great job with bringing this comic book hero to the big screen because it could have easily gone pear shaped. He covered a lot of elements, which could have easily split into 2 movies, and the clever ending with Captain America, shows that there are some interesting plans for Ant-Man. His previous titles include Bring It On, Down With Love, The Break-Up and Yes Man. Its not surprising that he brought a witty script to this project and I personally don't think that it would have worked if he tried to make a movie about a Ant-Man, seriously. I liked the Falcon scenes and when Scott used the ants to take on the baddies but the giant ant went a bit too far. Paul Rudd, a young looking 46 year-old, returns as Ant-Man in Captain America: Civil War, which is in post-production and Ant-Man and the Wasp is due to come out in 2018 so we haven't seen the last of this tiny but powerful super hero.<br/><br/>Budget: $130million Worldwide Gross: $520million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll and Michael Pena. 7/10"

And I was. <br/><br/>This is a movie that is suitable for people of all age groups, but especially the kids. They would love it. The main characters, though not great are pretty good. The visuals are neat, the story line OK. The support characters add in the humor and there are some pretty good light moments in the film.

"tomgillespie2002","7","0","2","3 December 2015"," Fits nicely into Marvel's Cinematic Universe while maintaining a low-key feel
","When the news broke that Edgar Wright, the visionary writer-director who had been working on adapting Ant-Man for Marvel since before Iron Man (2008) and the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, dropped out citing creative differences with the studio, things didn't look promising for the miniature hero. Still, Wright and co-writer Joe Cornish's story remained in tact and the directorial reigns were passed to Peyton Reed, director of such routine genre fare as The Break-Up (2006) and Yes Man (2008). Although we can lament the loss of Wright's take on the character - a version we will now never see - Ant-Man turned out better than anyone could have expected.<br/><br/>One of the Marvel's biggest problems is constantly setting up their heroes to face a big bad with a plan to destroy the world in one shape or another, leading to a special effects-laden showdown in which all is saved (bringing down a building or ten in the process). The motivation for strapping on the suit for cat burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is not to prevent global destruction, but to redeem himself in the eyes of his young daughter, whose growing-up he has missed the bulk of due to a stretch in San Quentin. Following his release, Lang tries to go straight and gets a demeaning job, which he soon loses when they discover his criminal past. Unable to pay child support to his ex- wife (Judy Greer) and her new cop hubby (Bobby Cannavale), he takes a big job suggested to him by old criminal acquaintance Luis (the scene-stealing Michael Pena).<br/><br/>When Lang successfully breaks into the high-tech safe, all he finds is an old suit and some jars containing various coloured liquids. Curious, he tries on the suit (kudos to costume designer Sammy Sheldon for the steampunk creation) which shrinks him down to the size of a pencil tip. Guided by a strange voice in his ear, he escapes a bath filling with water, a packed dance-floor and a hungry rat, eventually working out how to grow to normal size again. It turns out that the voice belongs to Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who perfected the ability to shrink down the size between atoms while maximising speed and strength, but who hid his formula from the world in the hope of preventing its misuse. Pym hopes to employ Lang, with the help of his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly), to break into his own company's headquarters and steal a similar suit developed by his mentally unstable former protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). Or, as he puts it, ""break into a place and steal some s**t.""<br/><br/>One of the key reasons that led to the abdication of Edgar Wright was Marvel (and Disney's) desire to see Ant-Man woven into the bigger Universe. While I have no doubt Wright's version would have been a stand-alone treat full of the visual splendour seen in the likes of Hot Fuzz (2007) and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), the final product of Ant-Man in no way suffers from referencing events of Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015) and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War, and manages to maintain a low-key feel. Anyone who knows anything about the comics will know what a huge character Hank Pym is, so leaving him out of the bigger picture would have certainly been a missed opportunity. It also leaves room for one the film's funniest scenes, in which Lang inadvertently arrives at the new Avengers base to steal a piece of technology, and finds himself up against the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) in the process.<br/><br/>Rudd works those puppy-dog eyes overtime and gains abs to rival Chris Pratt's recent transformation for Star-Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy, helping make Lang one of the most lovable reluctant heroes of all of Marvel's 'Phases'. He is one of the most effortlessly endearing comedians working at the moment, but its Michael Pena who stands out the most as his fast-talking criminal sidekick. Douglas also brings experience and emotional weight as the complex Pym, and Lilly demonstrates some untapped physical prowess while rocking a bob. It isn't perfect of course - Cross isn't a particularly interesting villain although Stoll performs well, and perhaps the script tries to tell one joke too many at times. But any film that successfully convinces you that its protagonist can talk to ants without drawing immediate laughter (even getting us to care for Lang's winged favourite Anthony) is doing something right. Roll on the recently-announced sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>While premise of ""Ant-Man"" (2015) is beyond absurdity, it is quite entertaining flick. While movie is good, i can go with any premise or story, no matter how ridiculous it might sound, and ""Ant-Man"" is no exception.<br/><br/>I don't read comics and i'm not a fan of Marvel movies, although have seen them all. That said ""Ant-Man"" isn't surprising or original like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" by far, but it is nicely made flick. Special effects were good, action is your usual Marvel stuff when things gets blow up but nobody except for villains don't die. Acting was OK by all involved, but nothing serious. On the other hand it just can't be serious when you are playing in Marvel universe movie - no one will ever win Oscar for performance in Marvel movies - it just not meant to happen because of the formula and material. This is why i consider any minute of ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy better by many moons in comparison to best stuff from Marvel movies. <br/><br/>Overall, this flick is very nicely paced so at the running time 1 h 45 min it does not drag. It is also has some humour mostly from coming from the best comic relief currently in business Michael Peña (will he ever will have some serious roles?). It is very easy movie best enjoyed with bunch of friends."

","Another commercial super-hero movie. The plot is very simple, too simple. Between the other super-hero movies from marvel this one seems more approachable to the public, although it is still just another predictable flick.<br/><br/>I wish the main character, the ant-man, would had more focus on the movie (I think the character needed to be more developed) and that the romance involving him needed to be better also, since there will be another movie with her.<br/><br/>It is not a bad movie, the problem is that is also not a memorable or a exciting one."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","2","24 November 2015"," Objectively fine, yet the worst Marvel movie so far
","So far Marvel hasn't dropped the ball with its Cinematic Universe. All of the movies in the Universe have been huge blockbusters, massively successful and, above all else, enjoyable beyond belief. And I'm not saying that Ant-Man is finally the one where they lose it. But it's the one that comes the closest.<br/><br/>I think the biggest reason for this is the fact that this is such a small movie. It tells about a burglar, a likable guy in general, who unfortunately operates on the wrong side of the law, and has thus fallen on some bad times. But then comes a man who offers him one last gig that would set him for life, allowing him to provide for his daughter. And safe the world in the process, because this is still Marvel after all. A classic heist movie setup - aside from megalomaniac antagonist selling superweapons, of course - nothing wrong with that. The problems arise when you compare it to other Marvel films. We've had scoundrel protagonists before. Both Tony Stark and Peter Quill are more than a touch shady. Yet the difference between them and Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is the scope of their actions. Both Stark and Quill save the world, operate on a vast arena, are larger than life in their character and in their actions. Lang saves the world, after a fashion, but it feels tacked on, like it doesn't belong.<br/><br/>I'm also not a fan of the humour in this film. The range of this film's comedy is acknowledging an awkward situation, making a wiseass remark about it, holding a moment of silence and moving on. Sure, when Tony Stark does it, it's hilarious, but when Paul Rudd attempts the same, it's embarrassing. It's the epitome of British humour made by Americans. It doesn't work. At all. I hummed in amusement perhaps once, and that's it.<br/><br/>I also have problems with Evangeline Lilly's character Hope. And the problem is not Lilly's performance, she's more than qualified. The problem is with the script, because at the end you realize that the only reason they were holding her back was for sequel bait. And that's simply not acceptable. The story of the film would have been over in minutes if they had simply done the logical thing and allowed her character to deal with the problem. But no, we have to leave room for a sequel. Cow manure, I say.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much the film in a nutshell. It's a decent heist film with gorgeous special effects, average characters, awful sense of humour and an okay story. My least favourite Marvel movie so far, but an acceptable movie in general."

","First the good stuff.<br/><br/>The film is enjoyable. Action was great as expected and the CGI was excellent.<br/><br/>Regarding acting Paul, Rudd and Michael Douglas were excellent choices. The rest of the case was OK.<br/><br/>Now to the bad stuff: The Film - although being of a superhero genre - requires you to turn off dozens of switches regarding major scientific and/or even simplistic rules of physics. A 80kgr ant-man that weights 80kgr even when shrink-ed, stands on top of ants or other people while retaining the momentum of full weight. Duh ? But we can bypass that, its a superhero movie.<br/><br/>The darn thing we cannot bypass is how on earth did the ""villain"" learn to utilize his suit in a few minutes, while Rudd took an entire week of failures to achieve that. It would be more realistic if he had a sidekick specializing onto suit combat and training. Just as Ironman I, we suddenly get an ultra villain trained to use a suit that was just built. Duh? But the final verdict is that Ant-man was still enjoyable. A solid 7/10 from me."
"Matt_Layden","6","0","2","21 November 2015"," What Could Have Been?
","Ant-Man had the opportunity to be one of the most visually bizarre and interesting Marvel films to date. I think back to the pre-production stages of the film and was pretty puzzled that Edgar Wright was the man behind this project. Could he work with such a big studio, being the visually distinct director that he is? The answer was of course no. He left the project and we got The Break-Up's Peyton Reed. That's not a negative to Reed, he does his job in giving the audience an approachable Marvel superhero film. But...I keep asking myself that questions; ""What could have been?""<br/><br/>Scott Lang is a master thief who just got out of prison. Hank Pym is a genius inventor who's been keeping an eye on Lang for some time. You see, Pym was the original Ant-Man. He has hidden the suit and the secrets to it for years in fear of it falling into the wrong hands. His predecessor, Darren Cross is trying to replicate the same formula and Pym must train a new Ant-Man is stop Cross from achieving his diabolic plans. Scott Lang is the new Ant-Man.<br/><br/>Much like Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man had an uphill battle to be taken seriously. A superhero that is the size of an ant? How can that possibly be good? Well, Marvel has done it again, they delivered a good movie. That's all this film is though, a good movie. The film plays it so safe and by the book that I was actually taken back a bit. If anyone of the new superheroes could fall in line with the rough edged Guardians, surely it would be this one right? Nope. Ant-Man is so safe it could be a kids movie....in fact, it just might be a kids movie. <br/><br/>CGI overload of course, every time we shrink to the size of an ant. Interesting perspective at times, blurry at others due to the kinetic nature of the plot. The most impressive use of CGI has to be in the first 5 minutes, with a young Michael Douglas being all Benjamin Button on us. I was hoping that the effects flipping our protagonist and antagonist would result in something new, something fun or interesting in the fight or chase sequences, but Reed doesn't seem interested in that. He seems more interested in playing ball with the suits behind the camera. ""We need this to be shown so we can see it develop at a later time in another film"". Hence the entire Falcon sequence, which seems out of place, if neat. <br/><br/>Rudd is a decent superhero. He has the comedic timing to be likable, much like Chris Pratt. He was able to work his body into shape, much like Chris Pratt. Also, he walks that fine line of bad-boy, likable schmuck. Much like....you get the idea. Douglas plays mentor here and has one scene where he gets to act a little bit with his on screen daughter, played by Evangeline Lilly. If Paul Rudd isn't funny enough for everyone, Michael Peña fills that void as the sidekick. I think Corey Stoll, who hams it up a bit as the villain, does the more interesting things. Everyone else seems to simply service the role, not taking any chances, or bringing anything new to the table. I'm glad to see Stoll get some bigger roles now. <br/><br/>All in all, Ant-Man is serviceable to the big budget superhero genre. It doesn't really further the Marvel agenda, nor does it re-invent anything. It will most likely be forgotten in a few years and find itself somewhere in the middle road of the list on people's ""Best Marvel Films"". That's the problem with this film, it's just perfectly content with being good movie and nothing more."

","The last entry to the second phase of the MCU. This has a sort of inverse problem compared to Ultron, which was dark and sleek and threatened to end the world but had one liners leaking out like no tomorrow. This is a much smaller scaled movie and the humour is allowed to be fresh because we are only just being introduced to these characters and the stakes aren't that high anyway. Sometimes it works, sometimes it's ridiculously jarring. <br/><br/>Michael Peña is Luis, Scott's Mexican jailmate, who carries an infectious enthusiasm and spends much of the film with a big childish grin on his face as if he's the only one aware that he is living out a Marvel comic-book. His best moments are characterised by these multi-layered flashbacks where he details the dodgy sources of his tips, and where each encounter's edits are accompanied by a loud whoosh like a sitcom cutting to a different scene, and his lovable bumbling voice-over perfectly matches with the larger than life characters in his ludicrous story. The camera zooms eagerly into these little recreations and we are immediately keyed into how unreliable Luis is, but just how much he wants to help. Less effective are the other two wombats. One cannot even be dubbed a black stereotype for how shallow his character is; he provides a distraction by momentarily taking a police car on a joyride and does seldom else. The other is the textbook computer whiz combined with Russian mobster, whose accent is much thicker than need be and mumbles out heist phrases whilst having a grammar crisis. And there's Hope, the partly estranged daughter whom harbours tension and resentment solely because of a secret that needs to be revealed midway through for plot reasons. <br/><br/>She features in one of the worse training montages I have ever seen in a movie. We first get repetition of a small but simple task, which is met with comedic failure, familiar as always. Then there is a need to learn how to punch, which somehow means martial arts with Hope. Why isn't there another way of demonstrating strength in a female character apart from some head-scissors hurricana takedown? In the midst of it we get a jarring insert of plot, where a sly mention of the deceased mother and wife is slipped in, to grins (yes, really). Right after is a more sentimental moment, where Hank Pym warns of the dangers of going sub-atomic (it's better that they don't try to explain it), but of course that is met with tonal whiplash from the cheerful Scott. He later does the same thing as father and daughter reunite and embrace, and this is comedy for the sake of it, except it is not funny, just awkward and forced. And finally we have the ultimate test of...willpower, which seems to be the abstract source behind controlling the ants. As long as Rudd squints his eyes and concentrates hard enough, the task can be done. Is this an anime?<br/><br/>Even amongst a see-sawing tone, there are action sequences that are quite thrilling. The deft balance of macro and life size means that each sensation in the Ant-Man suit is heightened to its fullest. It would be easy to fill the first sequence with many slow motion gigantic objects and people about to crush him, but there are also plenty of shots away from his POV which do a much better job of demonstrating his tiny figure; the tilt-shift selective focus enhances his profile through a crowd of feet in a nightclub, on a spinning record, in a grimy bathtub, on a carpet that seems like a surface inside a toy house. The sound design is also excellent in portraying this; the crashing boom of a huge belt buckle, a tap stream turned into a tsunami, the little dink as he bounces down a pipe and onto the roof of a taxi, barely making a scratch. Later, we have these clever cuts that provide both comedy and context, as we shift worlds. They battle amongst floating giant lolly wrappers, phones and keys, as The Cure's Disintegration blasts and buzzes depending on whether we are inside or outside of the briefcase, before a very frank shot of a simple object falling into the pool. This is later again used as the fury of the battle is contrasted with Cassie's POV of tiny little lasers and little flies buzzing around, and the sound of entire train carriages exploding and the menacing whistle cuts to a dink as Thomas the Tank Engine toys topple over. <br/><br/>It's unfortunate that the main villain is once again disappointing as per Marvel. All throughout we get Cross and Hank verbally battling and clashing egos, and we sense a deeper motive here, but there is almost nothing to go on, zero subtext to interpret. Stoll's performance is very much mechanically generic, playing the usual mad scientist who feels wronged and has to take back what he feels is rightfully his. But his speech is casual, and his threats shallow, and so there is no build-up or moment where he becomes the vengeful Yellowjacket. Douglas murmurs about a younger him, brasher, bolder, more arrogant, but this does not exist anywhere but in the words of the script, or in Cross. Sure, the costume design is sleek and frightening and well animated as a Marvel blockbuster should have, but there is only so much it can do. The best performance therefore must go to the child actress playing Cassie. Unlike her mother and step-father who reek of lazy writing, her character is simple, innocent and displays the most authentic emotions out of the entire cast. Does it really matter if Scott plot-devices his way out of the climax? She makes it worthwhile to sit through and root for Ant-Man."

","When I first heard about Ant-man I was shocked, not only because the concept was new but because it was made by Marvel studios. I didn't expect the movie to make its mark in the audience. But when I saw the movie myself, I was damned. It was a very enjoying action heroic movie. And the thing Marvels created it himself has done half of its work in attracting the audiences. A new superhero with amazing ability to shrink himself has emerged and it gives Marvel a new line of sequels to it. The movie was fun, astonishing & more importantly worth watching. I loved this movie I recommend every action lover to watch this movie. I would go with 4/5 for Ant-Man."

","Going to give 2 reviews as per usual. 1 for if you pay to watch the movie and the other for the casual streamers/downloaders. <br/><br/>Visual effects are pretty cool for this movie. I personally only watched via stream so it would be a lot better at the cinema. Acting isn't bad and the story/script is OK for a marvel movie. I was actually expecting a lot worse to be honest. The movie moves a long at a decent pace. My only problem is the fact they made ant man a comedic figure. If you read the comics and watch justice league he's not really that type of guy. For me that is the biggest downfall for this movie. I know the die-hard comic fans will hate this because of that. If you are the casual movie type than you won't mind it as much. If they spent a bit longer making this movie could of been a lot better. Hollywood seems to be pushing out marvel flicks nonstop these days. I thought the script was better than the latest avenger film with a stacked cast. <br/><br/>So here are my ratings: <br/><br/>if you paid for the movie 7/10<br/><br/>stream/download 7.4/10"
"nathenleeturner","8","0","2","9 November 2015"," Not my favorite
","I suppose there was only so much Marvel could do with this character. But to be honest I was disappointed. Paul Rudd was an odd choice to play a superhero, but he brought a comedy element. And perhaps there was just a little too much of the comedy element present in what was supposed to be a comic book based action/adventure. It was well written and well acted, the scene were well made. But there was just some of the excitement missing that we expect in Marvel movies. And there were several plot lines we never had explained to us from the beginning. If I had to guess I'd say the writers were given the task of creating an Ant-Man movie and just threw it together in a short period of time."
"andrewnmiller","10","0","2","7 November 2015"," Feels more like a heist film rather than a superhero film.
","Having never read a single Ant Man comic as a kid, I went into my local theater speculating how Marvel would be able to make people care about a lesser-known Marvel character with mediocre abilities. Sure enough, Marvel keeps proving me wrong because Ant-Man really surprised me with its great writing and humor, fantastic action scenes, great performances and a really touching story about redemption. After watching it, After watching it, I don't think I've had as much fun watching a Marvel movie in the theater as much as Ant-Man.<br/><br/>The movie begins in 1989 where inventor Hank Pym quits S.H.I.E.L.D. upon discovering that they have tried to reproduce his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Considering the technology to be too risky, Hank vows to keep it hidden for as long as he lives. We than cut to the present where Pym's daughter, Hope and his past apprentice, Darren Cross, have pushed Hank out of the company and Cross is close to finalizing a shrinking suit of his own. Meanwhile, well-meaning burglar Scott Lang is released from jail and moves in with an old cell-mate. While visiting his daughter unexpectedly, Scott is scolded by his ex-wife and her police husband-to-be for not paying child support. Soon after, Lang comments a robbery with a few friends where he breaks into a house, only to find what appears to be an old motorcycle suit, but when he tries it on, he discovers its true powers. It turns out that Hank Pym ticked Lang into stealing the suit and now, wants him to become the new Ant-Man in order to stop Cross from launching the Yellowjacket suit.<br/><br/>I truly don't believe that there has ever been a superhero film where the lead character starts out as somebody who could usually be the villain and comes out as a hero in the end. This must've been a difficult achievement for the writers and the director to pull off and yet, they did just that and made Scott Lang so likable that you're cheering for him throughout the whole movie. In a nutshell, the idea of overcoming or submitting to your past is the thematic thread of the film as Scott desires to earn back his daughter's love by becoming a better man, while Hank Pym is attempting to rewire his relationship with Hope and come to terms with his wife's passing, and Hope and Darren are attempting to grapple with their own difficult feelings toward Pym's behavior towards them. Eventually, with each of the characters defined, it doesn't take the viewer long who conquers their past and who doesn't, but the fact that a comic book film contains such themes as redemption and making amends for your past mistakes as well as the risks of hate and envy adds a lot to the final film.<br/><br/>The screenplay written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd mixes all the elements of a Marvel film by throwing in action, comedy, and even some emotion and it's all written capably which serves the film well. The movie is overflowing with humor and even during the serious moments, there is at least some comedy to prevent things form getting too stale. These days, few movies are bold enough to be a little silly and have a fun time, but Ant-Man really excels at that and one can tell that the filmmakers knew the idea was ridiculous and they didn't care. The characters take the circumstances they're in seriously and have faith in their causes, but are also cracking jokes at every turn which does make a film a lot more light hearted than say Batman V Superman.<br/><br/>The special effects are top-notch, particularly the scenes of Ant-Man shrinking and his interaction with the ants. The action scenes are stunning and very well done with the fight between Ant-Man and Falcon and the end battle between Ant-Man and Yellowjacket taking place in his daughter's room on a play area with a toy Thomas the Tank Engine track with our hero and villain having a massive fight in miniature that manages to be humorous, but also has the viewer feeling fearful and struggling to breathe. This movie is a different turn for Marvel in terms of the action and story and while it isn't epic or action-packed as The Avengers, it has a nice mixture of humor, story, touching moments, dangerous circumstances, stunning technical developments and a concluding fight.<br/><br/>Much like Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy, Paul Rudd is incredibly likable as Scott Lang and fits into the role perfectly, dropping the archetypal Rudd jokes that we know and love, but is also capable of showing real emotion during the scenes with his daughter. Evangeline Lilly continues to show how tough she is in this film as her version of Hope Van Dyne is intense and definitely has attitude to boot. If another actor was to playing the role of Hank Pym, it could've been boring and moralistic, but Michal Douglas makes the character important and fascinating. His sense of humor is on point and has outstanding chemistry with the other actors. Corey Stool is pretty solid as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket and brings some depth to this evil scientist. Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian and T.I. all play a humorous group of crooks who provide extra humor to the movie, particularly towards the end of the film. Bobby Cannavale and Judy Greer play their roles well and Abby Fortson is cute as Lang's daughter. Even Anthony Mackie and Hayley Atwell show up as Falcon and Peggy Carter and give fine performances.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie a lot, it's funny, the actors all do a great job, it has great action and some very touching emotional scenes to boot. Make sure to stay after for two mid-credit scenes. Go see Ant-Man if you haven't already, it's one hell of a ride."
"Prichards12345","7","0","2","10 October 2015"," Engaging and Fun
","Reposting now hopefully some of the pathetic Anti-Marvel trolls have gone.<br/><br/>I didn't have high hopes for this, but Ant-Man is yet another enjoyable super hero adventure from Marvel. It has a surprising amount of character stuff, good performances all round (especially from Michael Douglas, who oozes class) and the action is quirky fun for the most part. It didn't open well, but word of mouth helped bring it steady box office receipts, and now a sequel is apparently on the way.<br/><br/>Ant-Man's first shrinking sequence is astonishingly (sorry) inventive, starting with him washed down a plug-hole in a shower; and Paul Rudd is an engaging hero, playing it just right. You are not going to get The Dark Knight here; it's light-hearted for the most part, and while Yellow Jacket is a bit of generic villain I liked the actor in the role. Marvel do need to get away from villains in combat exo-suits, though.<br/><br/>Other than that Ant-Man is an engaging and likable adventure, with Ant-Man's powers inventively utilised, and an interesting little fight with The Falcon thrown in. There's a great gag involving Yellow Jacket and an Insectocutor, which had the whole audience laughing during the screening I attended. This may be Marvel's most family friendly movie to date; perhaps with the second movie they will go a bit darker. It whipped Fantastic Fail's ass, and now hopefully Marvel will get the rights to that, too."
"linhtinhhambalang","8","0","2","8 October 2015"," Ant-Man, a new Marvel superhero
","Marvel Studios produced another blockbuster hit which debuted summer 2015 based on a DC Comic story, Ant-Man. This movie follows the success of the superhero movies: the Avengers, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man. The director, Peyton Reed, successfully transfers the Ant-Man story from comic to the big screen. The movie surpasses the audience's expectations about the superpowers of Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) defeating villain - Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) under the guide of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) - a former Ant-Man. Ant-Man whose real name is Scott Lang, is a young dad and a master thief just released from jail. Lang does not know that Pym is setting him up to become Ant-Man by letting him steal the suit. The suit Pym designed can shrink a human down to be a small and powerful ant. Pym chose Lang to wear the suit and hopes Lang will take over the duties of Ant-Man. Pym needs Lang to fight against Darren Cross, the CEO of Pym Technologies Company. Darren Cross becomes the villain, Yellowjacket, with the plan to use these powerful suits to control the world. The story ends with a predictable victory of Ant-Man, defeating Yellowjacket. The movie also leads audience to the next Avengers sequel where Ant-Man will join the new Avengers team. Ant-Man has a long and slow opening to the story. The movie opens with many scenes of Lang's life after jail. He struggles with no place to stay and no money to have the custody of his daughter. The reason Pym chose Lang as the next generation of the Ant-Man suit is not reasonable and convincing enough to make the story smooth. However, in the middle of the movie, the audience is surprised by the superpower of the suit and the cooperation between Lang and his ant friends. It brings new and diverse action scenes in the blockbusters that Marvel have never had before. The tiny Ant-Man defeats Yellowjacket's plot and saves his daughter, not the entire world like other Marvel superheroes. Even though the costume does not make Ant-Man look incredible and super powerful like his Marvel fellow heroes such as Iron Man or Captain America, it earns the audience's impression of the conveniences of being small in the suit. When Lang breaks into Pym's company to steal Cross's project, he can go through the smallest path to the project's storage as an Ant-Man. The movie serves fair entertainment with fighting scenes and humorous minor characters. Lang's thief group supports him from outside of Pym Technologies Company while he is stealing inside the building, which entertains the audience. Or the fighting scenes between Ant-Man and Yellowjacket transforming back and forth between the size of human and ant create some fun and interest to audience. However, the director does not create a Yellowjacket villain evil and dangerous enough to push story setting at stake. The fighting scenes might bring audience enjoyment, but they are lacking high attractiveness and extreme drama. The director could have put the world threatened by Yellowjacket to increase the role of Ant-Man in saving the date. Thus, the fighting would be the hit of the movie. Even though Ant-Man did not make as much money as the other Marvel comics-based-stories, Director Peyton Reed succeeds to bring up the story for Ant-Man to join the new Avengers team. Ant-Man begins the story of the new Avengers and makes the tight interconnection of Marvel comic-based-superheroes. It makes audience curious and excited to see how Ant-Man will contribute to the team. Overall, it is well worth two hours of watching."

"rabyisabelle1","8","0","6","25 August 2015"," Don't judge a film by it's title...
","Upon entering the cinema I wasn't too sure whether I would fully enjoy this film, as I was under the impression that it was aimed at a younger audience. Perhaps I thought this when I first saw the title of the film, as it didn't sound as magnificent as some of the other superhero movies out there, or maybe it was because the 'insect superhero' thing had already been done with the Spiderman franchise. I soon realised that I was very wrong to judge the film by it's title. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd's performance as Scott Lang in this film was funny and lighthearted, despite the film being different to the ones he normally stars in. At first I thought it was strange to see him in the role of a thief, however I soon found out that he is just as funny in this film as he is in his other roles. <br/><br/>Although Michael Douglas has primarily starred in films aimed at a older audience, such as 'The Game' and 'Fatal Attraction', he fitted the role of Dr. Hank Pym very well. <br/><br/>The film itself was very fast paced and humorous, and the idea of ant sized human with an army of ants is a truly unique and fascinating idea for a superhero. Even though the idea of an ant as a superhero did sound quite mediocre, the plot certainly isn't. It is full of twists and turns, and kept me on the edge of my seat in the cinema. At certain points the film is very funny, and the rest of the audience certainly seemed to think so too!<br/><br/>The special effects and explosions were fantastic, and when Rudd's character 'transformed' into the Ant-man, I actually believed he was the size of an ant. It was almost as if the audience shrunk too, because of how threatening normal environments suddenly became. The CGI was used effectively to create an amazing-looking ant army, especially Antony the flying ant. <br/><br/>What I liked in particular about this film was that the plot was easy to follow, as I tend to get confused quite easily when it comes to action- type films. I can say that I will most probably watch it again when it is released onto DVD, which is an achievement for me as I rarely watch films twice. <br/><br/>Definitely give this film a shot, even if it seems like something you would not normally enjoy. It is fun for all the family, as my younger brothers thoroughly enjoyed it too. And I know that I will never be able to look at ants the same way again it was weird to see how scary ants can really be!"

","I was not familiar with the ""Ant Man"" story. When I saw this I did not know it was a Marvel film. I enjoyed this movie. Not because of he story, which I thought it was weak. Way too much happen for no apparent reason or explanation. I found the main characters to be dull and unimpressive with the exception of Luis, Kurt & Dave. I would go see a movie about those 3 guys. Their characters could use more fleshing out but I thought they were written well and acted well. It was nice to see one of the members of the Avengers, Falcon. However his appearance also brings up several unanswered questions. I will not ask the questions here as to not throw spoilers out. This was a completely different type of Marvel hero film but Ant Man is like a mid-budget Iron Man."

","I have to admit I wasn't excited about this going in, mostly because I'm a big fan of Edgar Wright and it was disappointing to hear that he was replaced by Peyton Reed. But regardless of the production changes, the film won me over. Most comic book movies (Like the recent Avengers film) are fun but eventually devolve into formulaic beat 'em up smack downs between the good guys and the villain. And while there is a villain fight at the end, the action-filled finale is inventive and fun, taking advantage of the shrinking and growing powers. Not a game changer, but a solid enough entry to keep the franchise going until Civil War."

","Don't go into this movie expecting huge set pieces. I was very surprised how good this movie actually was. I think it was a nice change to be scaled down after the massive Ag of Ultron (which I enjoyed). We've been given so many huge stories that it was actually a breath of fresh air to have something smaller, funny, and enjoyable<br/><br/>The cast: Paul Rudd was perfect. He was funny and charming. Michael Douglas played a great Hank Pym and great mentor. The villain was fairly good. He wasn't any Loki or Winter Soldier, but he was a better villain than anyone Iron Man has faced (in terms of characterization, not strength). He was crazy and you could tell he had problems with Hank. Evangeline Lilly I liked but she wasn't my favorite. I'm not hating on her, she did a fine job, I just wasn't a crazy fan of her acting. <br/><br/>The story: a superhero movie about a man who shrinks to the size of an ant and named antman is a recipe for disaster. BUT THE PULLED IT OFF. Seriously, the story was great. Was it amazing? No, but I throughly enjoyed the story. I loved how it was a guest. The movie was just different<br/><br/>The special effects: seeing Paul Rudd turn small was so fun to see! They handled every shrinking scene wonderfully<br/><br/>Was it the best Marvel movie? No. Was it up there as one of the better ones? I'd say yes simply because it was good, enjoyable, fresh, fun, and different. There were a couple of slow parts, but over all, I recommend seeing it. You'll be surprised"
"boyznick","9","0","6","11 August 2015"," A worthy entry to the MCU
","Once again Marvel has pulled a bunny out of the hat! Ant-Man is definitely a worthy entry to the MCU! Following the success of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel has continued to show us you don't need an A list hero to make a great movie.<br/><br/>I was disappointed when Edgar Wright pulled out from the film nevertheless I think Peyton Reed did an absolutely fantastic job in bringing us one of the funniest film in the franchise.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>The film started off with Hank Pym and SHIELD parted ways but it was good to see Peggy Carter and Howard Stark running SHIELD together (I wish they have kept Dominic Cooper even as the aged Howard Stark which would be consistent to photographs in Cap 2 where Cap & Black Widow located the original SHIELD headquarter)<br/><br/>Skipped right where Scott Lang donned the Ant-Man suit for the very first time, the bath tub scene provided us a genuine thrill experience of what the miniaturize world would look like! It was perfectly captured and I have always been a fan of a superhero's origin story. It was just very entertaining to see Hank passing on the mantle of Ant-Man to Scott (I am talking about the key hole scene). <br/><br/>For most part of the film, I think it holds pretty well as a standalone film until the inclusion of Falcon & the new Avengers facilities but I guess this would serve as a bridge to the rest of the MCU particularly next year's Captain America Civil War. <br/><br/>Finally, we have the showdown between Ant-Man & Yellowjacket (what's more fun when you see Thomas the tank engine crashing into Yellowjacket) and well Hydra did get away with the Cross particles right.. I guess this would serve as a cliffhanger to the upcoming sequels or maybe even for the Agents of Shield? It could be they are now working for Grant Ward after the fall of Strucker, Whitehall or whoever is left<br/><br/>To conclude, Ant-Man has been a fun ride and easily one of the best films of the holiday season. Marvel had us worried after the disappointing Age of Ultron but this proves that Marvel has still got it!"
"jpx400","8","0","8","8 August 2015"," A surprising and entertaining entry in the Marvel franchise
","Ant-Man felt like something of a gamble when I went into the theater because I worried that a superhero with nothing but the powers of shrinking and controlling ants wouldn't be able to carry a whole movie. It didn't take long for it to convince me otherwise.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd stars as Scott Lang, a convicted thief fresh out of prison and struggling to make an honest living and get visitation rights to be with his daughter. He is recruited by scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the inventor of the original Ant-Man technology, to break into his old tech company and prevent its new CEO, Pym's former protégé Darren Cross (Cory Stoll) from turning the technology into a weaponized suit called ""the Yellowjacket"". They are aided by Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lily), Scott's former cell mate Luis (Michael Peña) and two small time crook friends.<br/><br/>Scott's comparatively normal background and sympathetic personality makes him a more relatable and refreshingly down-to-earth character than most other Marvel heroes. He isn't a millionaire, a demi-god or has any superpowers, he is just a normal guy with an empowered suit. And while the name ""Yellowjacket"" may sound a bit silly, Stoll's performance, which sometimes dips into over-the-top territory, and the menacing design of the suit make Darren Cross a surprisingly intimidating villain worthy of the Marvel franchise. However, the hero-villain relationship between him and Scott lacks some punch since Cross' hatred is more directed at Pym than him, making his animosity towards Scott more by proxy.<br/><br/>While Edgar Wright isn't directing Ant-Man, the script, which he co-wrote, has his fingerprints all over it. The story begins fairly mundanely, but gradually escalates further and further before exploding in a colorful and more than satisfying finale. Because Ant-Man introduces an almost whole new set of characters to the Marvel movies, the first part of the film contains a lot of backstory. While this bogs down the plot somewhat, the story keeps a consistent pace with regular doses of action that keeps the more explosive, special effect-filled second half from coming completely out of the blue.<br/><br/>With Ant-Man, Marvel has not only introduced an exciting, if smaller than usual, new angle to its cinematic universe. They have taken a character nobody thought could be cool and made a hugely entertaining movie about him and I look forward to seeing Ant-Man's role in the upcoming third phase of the Marvel saga."

I found myself waiting for him to make an appearance, but when he did, it was short-lived because he was barely in the film at all (Darren Cross as Yellowjacket, that is).<br/><br/>I thought that this film deserved more than the 80% rating it got from Rotten Tomatoes, but this film is definitely a Marvel film that I actually found more enjoyable than a lot of the others.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see Ant-Man in Captain America: Civil War."
"blakiepeterson","7","0","8","29 July 2015"," A Welcome Change for Marvel
","While the last few Marvel movies have been worthwhile, they've also steadily destroyed the sense of wonder I once felt when the fad was still fresh during 2012's ""The Avengers"". Being entertaining is never a problem when it comes to these movies, but being somewhat familiar is increasingly recurring. How many times can Captain America & Co. face a foe that seems unbeatable, ""surprisingly"" destroy him, and cause major damage to a nearby metropolitan city along the way? I hate to be a cynical critic, but I'm not so sure I can watch another ""Iron Man"" movie without liquidy bitterness swirling around in my psyche, castrating any fun to be had. Marvel has become so big, so stake-less, so predictable. I'm not necessarily asking for a blockbuster that calls for the death of the hero; I'm asking for a blockbuster that presents us with something big and predictable but also, cough cough, new-ish. <br/><br/>So when the trailers for ""Ant-Man"" mandatorily began to adorn cinema screens earlier this year, there wasn't a feeling of antipathy nor excitement; I figured it would be nothing more than yet another chance for Marvel to make some more dough and introduce a character that contributes nothing new to the already crowd-attracting assembly line of high- budgeted dazzlers. I wasn't planning on seeing it in theaters, but what do you know: on this hot summer afternoon, I purchased a ticket and found myself dumbfounded. ""Ant- Man"" is an abnormally fun 'hero-based actioner that presents us with something we haven't seen before (while, there I go again, also remaining big and predictable).<br/><br/>I suppose it has something to do with Paul Rudd, a charming actor playing a hero who finally isn't a wunderkind but an everyman attempting to redeem his wrongs. When we first meet Scott Lang, he is being released from prison (back in the day, he acted as whistleblower to his massive corporate company and slyly burgled some goods), barely able to make ends meet. He wants to be a success for his daughter, who lives with his ex- wife (Judy Greer) and her humorless fiancée (Bobby Cannavale), but, unable to pay child support, is shut out. So he turns back to his thieving ways, aided by his former cellmate (Michael Peña) and crew.<br/><br/>His first robbery comeback takes a strange turn when the house targeted does not contain a safe full of money but a safe than contains a mysterious super-suit; Lang, hardly thinking, grabs it in a hurry. He comes back home, tries it on, and finds himself shrunk to the size of an ant — as it turns out, the home did not belong to some random bystander but to Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the original Ant-Man. Pym, you see, has been watching Lang for years, figuring he would be a fitting successor. The position is in dire need to be filled, considering Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), the new head of Pym's company, has designed a similar suit being planned to be used for, you guessed it, evil. Like all men in his position, Lang is reluctant — danger comes fast and hard, after all — but he's at a point in his life where he has nothing to lose; he can either become the new Ant-Man or face more jail time. It's hardly a question which option he chooses. <br/><br/>While watching ""Ant-Man"", I found myself pleased with how small in scale it is. Gone are the GIGANTIC BATTLES, the HULK SMASHES, the OUTRAGEOUSLY POWERFUL VILLAINS; since Ant-Man is, you know, the size of an ant, most of the action takes place (with lovable playfulness, I might add) on, in, or around water pipes, toy train sets, carpets, and ant colonies — the visual changes from ""The Avengers"" and its cousins are enormously refreshing. And isn't it great to bask in the company of a villain not a robot nor a Shakespearian fool but simply a corporate head honcho hungry for control? The film is an assembly line of lightweight thrills, and it's a change worth celebrating. It's nothing new, but at least it's attempting to do things differently this time around.<br/><br/>I would assume an ""Avengers 3"", probably including Ant-Man, will come around sooner than a sequel; but I hope it doesn't end up that way. I've had enough of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner (though it'd be more accurate to say I need a break). More of Scott Lang and his cohorts will do just fine — it's time to make some room for transition, and it's a relief that Marvel seems to be headed in the right direction."

","Once again we see the ability that Marvel has to create an entertaining movie that will possibly be remembered for a long time, all starting from another of its secondary characters of all history of Marvel's Comics. <br/><br/>Ant Man, The Movie, is in part true story of Dr. Hank Pym pleasing lovers of comic books, and brings new things to attract the audience that is not fully inserted in this universe. It's great when a story has contacts through other characters that are not simply ignored, since we know that these stories are connected somehow, they are not direct sequels. This is clearly shown on Ant Man. In this production, initially forget the story of Dr. Hank Pym we know well through the comics of the Avengers, here we see Scott Lang, an electronics engineer who earned his ""powers"" to steal the garments of Doctor Hank Pym. With help from the scientist and his daughter, he needs to solve a major threat to humanity's future when Doctor Darren Cross tries to sell the miniaturization technology to the military.<br/><br/>From that moment Scott Lang becomes the Ant Man, using the miniaturization of power and communication with insects to invade Doctor Cross's laboratory to prevent his evil plans. As usual this production of Marvel is full of comic relief, Paul Rudd in the role of Scott Lang is funny and at the same time convincing as an action hero. The sequence of Ant Man training under the supervision of Doctor Pym (Michael Douglas) works very well and despite the miniaturization of magic, everything up to this point is quite credible. The participation of the daughter of Dr. Pym, Hope (Evangeline Lilly) creates the dramatic atmosphere between father and daughter, besides having the relationship of Scott Lang himself with the family, since the same was arrested for theft before becoming the hero. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the villain, also known as Yellow Jacket, follows the Marvel style and has no plans so appalling as to we find at some point that the good side is not victorious. The villain is shallow and his personal problems are not well developed. So, we think he would do something bad that was not even for money, thus, it becomes less dangerous. <br/><br/>The fight sequences are quite exciting, especially on the initial fight scene between Ant Man and The Yellow Jacket seen on the third act of the movie. <br/><br/>As an expected end, one more great development of story despite the script changes. The interactions between Marvel's movies are increasingly present on this movie. For those who like references, it is really an enjoyable movie."
"georgecoffeynewyorker","9","0","8","2 August 2015"," Very well done, lots of comical features,
","An interesting movie. Was quite amused by it. Plenny of comedy was a plenny. heheehe. The plot I was quite happy with. Was quite simple. A guy Scott(Rudd) of which I always mix him up with Ben Affleck, is a criminal. He is released from prison, and swears to go ""straight"", for his daughter Peanut/Cassie(Fortson). However, the bit I missed thou, was that Dr. Hank(Douglas) somehow hacks into the minds of Scott's friends Luis(Pena), Kurt(Dastmalchain) and Dave(T.I.). So he then is sent back to jail and Dr. Hank gets him out via his Antman suit. Yellowjacket(Stoll) is the villain in the film. I'm very impressed with the film, in particular the action ie the moves. The CGI could have been improved. There's been a promise of Avengers with Antman. That looks promising. My babe Falcon(Mackie) is donning his Falcon suit. He's quite a scorcher alrite. ahahah."
"davideo-2","7","0","8","2 August 2015"," Doesn't do better than when it starts, but still one of the better comic book films
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has just got out of jail, and seems consigned to a life of low rent living and even lower paid jobs. Down on his luck and depressed, he agrees to take on one more big time raid. But he doesn't know that this time, the potential victim is in on the act. For Scott is to rob the home of Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a brilliant scientist who retired from public life many years ago after his serum, which has the ability to shrink living subjects to the size of an ant, was misused by the company he worked for. Now, Dr Pym needs Scott to don the suit he designed and stop the diabolical Cross (Corey Stall) from wrecking hell.<br/><br/>There has been some kickback lately, what with the sheer onslaught of superhero films that are battering our screens, with even seasoned fans of the genre complaining of the 'infantilism' they are forging on people's minds. But they won't prove to be unpopular anytime soon, if things at the moment are anything to go by, and such it's a case of dividing the good ones from the bad ones. Ant-Man, another lesser known addition from the backlog of Marvel Comics, manages to score more hits than misses, and is for the most part a rollicking, crowd pleasing thrill ride that gets the tone just right, even if it doesn't quite know how to guide it.<br/><br/>With a director whose background appears to be more in comedy territory, the tone is never over laborious, and keeps the tongue in cheek spirit of the Avengers franchise in check. Admirably, the film establishes a proper asset up before getting in to the action, really taking time to develop the two main characters before charging in to the action. Sadly, once their paths cross, this doesn't last, and it loses it's sense of coherence a bit. By the end, it feels like it's been going on a little past it's two hour running time. Nevertheless, the film delivers where it's supposed to, the awesome, crowd pleasing set pieces, notably a grimy bathtub being turned into a spacious amphitheatre, people's feet needing to be dodged for dear life, and, more towards the end, a giant Thomas the Tank Engine coming to be discarded on a lawn! Plus there's the novelty of watching a man shrunk in to a grimy pulp, then casually flushed down a toilet (what other film can say that?) <br/><br/>It's neither as great as a lot of people say it is, or as bad as a few people say it is, but it's still a superior comic book film, that ticks all the right boxes and promises a fun filled ride. ***"
"alexgarcia732805","7","0","7","2 August 2015"," 7---A flawed but fun superhero movie.
","""Ant-Man"" is a good time. Of course, it could've been better, but the humor, 'heist' aspect of the movie, and miniature-sized action scenes make it fun enough.<br/><br/>**Michael Douglas managed to capture some of Hank's inner turmoil with what he was given. His anger, cynicism, and some tragic backstory (told to Scott and the audience by his daughter Hope) make Hank a compelling enough character. **Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is perhaps the most relatable of the cast. He's a normal, ordinary guy who works struggles with jobs (such as one at Baskin-Robbins). Paul Rudd brings a sort of average guy-charisma to the role, and you root for him and his redemption.<br/><br/>**Evangeline Lilly doesn't have much to work with as Hank's daughter Hope van Dyne. Her character could've used more development, but at least her dialogue with Scott and Pym is sometimes amusing. ** Ant- Man unfortunately continues the MCU movie trend of forgettable villains, as Corey Stoll plays Darren Cross (AKA cliché villain Yellowjacket). A businessman who wants to utilize revolutionary technology for evil purposes? This is not a new concept, and one already played out in ""Iron-Man"". (Remember Obadiah Stane?) **Michael Pena brings the laughs as Luis (Scott's old cell-mate in prison who he lives with once he gets out).<br/><br/>The movie feels lively and cheery throughout, and I think this is one of the main reasons why it works. The ""heist"" thing going on gives the movie a nice pace. The humor is enjoyable (although some may argue that some of the jokes are crude and only for 'cheap' laughs). At least the one-liners don't feel forced or unwarranted; the jokes and quips are more appropriately timed/placed than in Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The movie uses cliché tropes and story lines (strained family relationships, former criminal goes on quest for redemption, former protégé turns against mentor, etc). There is nothing surprising or ground-breaking about the story, and the scale of the finale might surprise some. However, I guess it's a good thing the world isn't in peril AGAIN in a Marvel movie, cause that has started getting old. (BTW, it has the best use of Thomas the Tank Engine ever!)<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Ant-Man"" is your basic superhero movie, but a fun time. If you like blockbusters and superhero films, then watch it. But if you're more picky about your entertainment, then pass.<br/><br/>I have reviewed 43 movies (on Metacritic and IMDb), some recent ones, including: Minions (Despicable Me spin-off), Avengers: Age of Ultron, Fast and Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, and more. I also review TV shows.<br/><br/>***Minor SPOILERS*** The movie shows the ""quantum realm"", a super- tiny place from which there is almost no return. It's a pretty interesting idea. Hopefully it's explored more. (Also, I get that Darren Cross was never meant to be a big villain, but did he have to get killed off, never to be brought up again?)<br/><br/>Notes: *The beginning of the film, showing a young Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and a younger SHIELD, is pretty interesting. The younger Hank's appearance is made possible using CGI to de-age actor Michael Douglas, and I would say it turned out pretty well. *A good idea for a new Marvel One-Shot might be to have one about Hank Pym and his early adventures as Ant-man. *Expect to see Hope van Dyne return in the MCU. She'll probably take on the mantle of the Wasp, from her mother. *R.I.P Anthony! That ant lived a good life :P"
"lasttimeisaw","7","0","8","2 August 2015"," ANT-MAN should be a staple of the Avengers ensemble and function far more critical than a comic relief
","A 3D cinema-going of Marvel's latest offering ANT-MAN, which has always been in the pickle during its journey to the big screen, originally it had been a brainchild of Edgar Wright for years, then he dropped out in the relatively late development due to creative disagreement, and Peyton Reed takes over the director chair. While Wright has a die-hard fanbase and a distinct visual style (although his geeky smartness sometimes can go overboard, like SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD 2010), Reed can no more than be extolled as a slick journeyman in cranking up comedies like YES MAN (2008, 6/10), THE BREAK-UP (2006, 6/10), DOWN WITH LOVE (2003, 5/10) and BRING IT ON (2000), so fans should automatically lower their expectation. <br/><br/>However, the final product transpires to be pretty diverting and humorous (certainly this should thanks to Wright's original script, which is kept in the movie to some degree), it can expediently reach the upper tier of Marvel's cinematic universe. Deadpan comedian Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a nimble-fingered thief with principles, a divorced middle-age father who always want to prove himself as a hero to his daughter, is selected to be the (second) Ant-man by Dr. Hank Pam (Douglas), who designs a special suit years ago, which can make the wearer shrink to the size of an ant, and indeed he is the first Ant-man. Together with the assistance of Hank's daughter Hope van Dyne (Lilly), Scott needs to learn how to mind- control his own ant army and gets acquaint with his new superpower, since the villain Darren Cross (Stoll), once Dr. Hank's protégé, who later ousted Hank from the company he established, also has managed to design a Yellowjacket suit can do the same, and decides to sell to the evil HYDRA organisation, Scott must stop him. <br/><br/>One plugging of the film is of course the size of Ant-man, indeed, the visual tactic is vastly refreshing when Ant-man shrinks to the size of an ant and the concurrent magnifying of our familiar world into giant environment, it situates us for the first time, observes the world from an insect's point-of-view, especially in the tub scene, when Scott experiences his transformation for the first time; also critically, what Ant-man has to deal with is not all the blasting and levelling bombardment which THE AVENGERS and other superhero franchises have bitten off more than we can chew, the scale of demolition is being crackly utilised, markedly in the big combat scene, it never get out of the bedroom of Scott's daughter Cassie (Fortson), which can at least appease the picture's second-rate arrangement of a super-villain and his rashly concocted ulterior motive, as well as the frustrating standard family fare after Scott shrinks to subatomic size and then cornily returns to the macroscopic world with her daughter as the emotional anchor. <br/><br/>The innovative visual gag aside, one promising winning part is its cast, Rudd has his natural charisma as an ordinary good-looking guy, laid-back and a real hoot, he and Chris Pratt are two new additions in the Marvel universe, and their comedic affinity does dissipate the fatigue of more straight-faced action hero's self-seriousness. Douglas emanates a sympathetic father-daughter bond with Lilly, which coherently corresponds with Scott and Cassie's rapport, and is fairly at ease in his mentor image. But, the real scene stealer is Peña as Luis, Scott's best buddy, his two tip-montage parts are scintilla-tingly hilarious, and Peña is such a gifted actor in comedic timing, and he can even upgrade not-so-funny lines to be a total riot, really impressive and surprisingly excellent! <br/><br/>One thing for sure, the pattern of the first chapter of a superhero-is-born is alway the same platitude, how he acquires the unique power, how to adopt to his superpower and his new identity, and finally how to finish off a villain, but, ANT-MAN provides a fresh angle/scale to widen our imagination, the knowing references to join the Avengers is his next move, and reckoning the prospect, ANT-MAN can be a staple of the ensemble and function far more critical than a comic relief, let's wait and see."

The acting was good, The action was as it should be in an ""Ant man"" movie but I think they still need to develop the action.Story was OK the heist concept was a good addition.<br/><br/>The Sci Fi concept was good it lacks action and was a very fast paced movie it was just 102 minutes and gone very fast. It is not upto that ""Marvel Movie Excitement"" but it was good at its place.<br/><br/>If you will watch this without thinking as a Marvel movie it will feel you good.<br/><br/>Overall a good but not great movie."
"opinionated-alchemist","6","0","10","1 August 2015"," Quite some fun- but surprisingly mediocre
","I wanted, that this movie is great! I seen several reviews, which made me even more anticipating this film. But personally it is over-promised but under-delivered!<br/><br/>Where should I start? The characters are likable. I do agree. But it is the story which is for me bloodless and the ""science behind the fiction"" which is absurd. <br/><br/>First the selection of ""the new Ant-Man""! The whole thing is not delivered believable. Paul Rudd's character doesn't seem really special enough, that he is secretly selected to be the new Ant-Man. Further the fall-out between Tony Stark and Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas) is also not really delivered believable. The whole plotting to get Scott Lang (Ant-Man) signing up, is also very stretched. The worst thing are the whole ants in the movie. While I can get it, to control ants- eventually they can miniaturize any tech to ant size, there are so many idiotic and unbelievable things, the ants are doing. One or two ant can move a sugar cube into a cup of tea? In which universe? A couple of ants can flip a coin? Not in my world.<br/><br/>Another thing is the villain, Darren Cross / Yellowjacket. Hope is suggesting him, that the Pym particle is altering his mind - but how I understood, he never really used the suit before. Even then - why is he so good in controlling the suit, when his arch-enemy needed a lot of training to control his suit.<br/><br/>Physics is also not the strength of the movie. On one hand I do understand, that the miniaturized person quite retains its power and density - but what is about weight? This could be explained with a bit more involvement of ""tech"" but the movie never really answered this phenomenon - and let's not talk about the shrinking to sub-atomic size. <br/><br/>Even further, the whole set up with the step-dad of his daughter, his wife etc. just felt staged. And at the end, the whole movie felt like a modern fairy tail. <br/><br/>I do value the reviews, which congratulate on a more relatable and imperfect character, the fun in the movie etc. Ultimately the ""fantasy"" just destroyed the fun for me. I don't want to turn completely my brain off for a movie. Yes - I can use my fantasy, and disregard some laws of nature, when it is sufficient explained - but this movie let me feel that the filmmaker thinks that I am stupid enough, to not understand how the world works. <br/><br/>Even the mid-credit scene and end-credit scene are just not as cool as I wished. <br/><br/>I have watched this movie in normal 2D - maybe due to the effects, I would have been more impressed in 3D. However personally I think a movie should not convince with the visuals alone (otherwise, they should have only released it anyway in 3D)."

"adamscastlevania2","7","0","5","29 July 2015"," A breath of much needed fresh air for the super hero genre
","(65%) After the somewhat disappointing feature-length video game footage that was Avengers 2 comes this step in a fresher direction. First of all it's nice to get a super hero who is just a normal guy and not a thunder god, multi-billion dollar businessman, or genetic freak of nature. And like a lot of these super hero movies the original origin story always seems to be the strongest because they have the best story arc, so we'll have to wait how Ant-man 2 will stand up in the next few years. This may not be a contender for the best super hero movie, but it is very watchable, consistently entertaining, and with a solid line up of screen talent in which the great Michael Douglas is given plenty of screen time. It's also a good fun watch with plenty of good humour and a lighter tone that works well. This won't last forever in the memory or make a massive mark on the year's best films, but a zesty trip to the cinema awaits all."
"NickMullins","7","0","5","28 July 2015"," Fun! - But missing something...
","Marvel has a wonderful way of making really stupid comic book characters into actually watchable entertainment; they do this by having a wonderful element of self conscientiousness. They know what they are making is absolutely bonkers, so they have fun with it. Because of this their movies are almost always a really good time However in the past after watching a Marvel movie (Guardians of the Galaxy, or the Avengers for example) you walk out with something to remember it by. There is usually at least one element that sticks with you and makes it more than just a good time. In Guardians it was the relationship Star Lord had with his mother, in Iron Man it was Tony Stark's character arc from playboy to much more mature playboy. In Ant-Man this element is sadly missing. The characters are fun, the story is fun, the visual effects are insanely fun...but that's it. Because of this, when the credits rolled I found myself asking ""is that it?"". I really do recommend this movie as one of the funnest summer movies I have ever seen, making it worth your money...But don't expect to remember it for more than a week or two."
"SforSmile","8","0","6","28 July 2015"," ""hahaha!""
","Where other Marvel movies were humorous where they should have been serious or silly where they should have been humorous, Ant-Man was just funny for the most part and absorbed me into a fantastically imaginative, tiny big world from the perspective of ants. <br/><br/>All the actors were likable and committed. Paul Rudd was just perfect for the main role, a completely down-to-earth guy with a very good sense for comical timing. Michael Douglas as Dr. Pym had a huge presence as usual and E. Lilly as his daughter (whom I thought to be Jessica Biel up until the end credits although I loved Lilly in 'Lost' - ""Hey man, he doesn't even know the actors' names, he is not qualified to write a review"") was just gorgeous and also smart and strong and therefore very emancipated. For one of the best comical moments (albeit some suspiciously silly moments too), the robber trio B. Cannavale, D. Dastmalchian and T.I as Paxton, Kurt and Dave (""The Three Marvel Stooges"") was elemental. One great compliment deserves young Abby R. Fortson as Scott's little daughter, she was sooooo sweeet and really could act! Finally, there is the main antagonist C. Stoll as Yellowjacket, a rather whiny antagonist but towards the end, he developed to a worthy opponent.<br/><br/>And for all the Marvel nerds: Yes there were some references to the Avengers (which I found rather distracting) and an interesting intermezzo with Falcon, but beware, there were no fancy Air Battleships and no Armageddon scenario with inter-dimensional wormholes, the movie was more a classical heist adventure peppered with a more or less convincing father-daughter conflict and it derived it's entertainment value not from extraordinary action scenes (which were considerably rare) but most of all from the marvelous sensation of being shrunken and especially from it's often subtle, often child-friendly sense of humor. It also conveyed a unique atmosphere similar to the 50's pulp monster movies, it had a nice retro touch, a bit like the first Captain America installment <br/><br/>Ant-Man is the best comedy of all the Marvel superhero movies."

"troyputland","8","0","5","26 July 2015"," Don't judge it by its trailers.
","Ant-Man's the underdog of the Marvel Universe. The smallest in size, the biggest personality. Paul Rudd's expert thief Scott Lang's the most likable, easy going hero in the MCU. He's a funny, charming ex-con who has a lot to lose if he's caught stealing again. Unfortunately for Scott, he's forced in to a situation where he has to 'break in to a place and steal some stuff', for the sake of the world. His new mentor, Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas) wants Scott to stop his old pupil (Corey Stoll) from building a new range of high-tech weapons for warfare. Ant-Man's not your typical superhero-origin story. What makes it a cut above the other Marvel movies is how he becomes the hero. The suit and its powers are odd. The ability to control ants is a strange but a much more impressive feat than originally assumed. Ant-Man's trailer doesn't do the film justice, because this is a bonafide superhero feast."
"temasavochkin","9","0","4","27 July 2015"," ""A Surprise""
","Sometimes I look forward to some Marvel movies, but I did not expect ""Ant-Man"" to be something great.<br/><br/>But turned out that it is. And I have some reasons to say that. The first thing I noticed when I was watching ""Ant-Man"" in the cinema is cameraman's work - it is a pleasure to watch this film.<br/><br/>And the second is the humour. It always is there in such movies, but in this film it is really organic and natural. Maybe because of Paul Rudd, the actor which plays the main character, he is mostly comic material.<br/><br/>And here we come, to the cast. The main characters do not need to be presented, especially Michael Douglas. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are also very impressive, but for me the icing on the cake became Michael Pena. He has brilliant dialogue and amusing action, Without him I would not enjoy this movie as much as I did.<br/><br/>I hope that Ant-Man is going to become that breath of fresh air that I fell short of when I was watching ""Age of Ultron"". So I wish this character luck and advise to everybody to go and make your own opinion about ""Ant-Man""."
"ditla","7","0","4","27 July 2015"," Ant-Man, a fun and slightly different MCU movie.
","This movie from the MCU tells a different tale than most others. If you as a viewer would sit down to watch this movie, without knowing anything about it, not even the title, you would most probably not believe it to be a superhero movie, if you start watching after the opening scene.<br/><br/>This makes Ant-Man, along with the sequences which sees Scott Lang minimized, a really original movie in this genre and great fun to watch.<br/><br/>The script is well written, because of this the conversations and the motives of the characters feels genuine, furthermore is the humor well timed as well as frequent and we've got mainly Michael Peña and Paul Rudd to thank for that.<br/><br/>The likes of Michael Douglas, Corey Stoll and Paul Rudd, most of the cast really, all stood for solid acting performances. However if director Peyton Reed had seen TIs acting through my eyes the role would've gone to someone else. <br/><br/>It would be interesting though to see Edgar Wright direct the movie, but you could still sense his involvement especially in the story telling moments of Luis' which had a lot of similarities to Shauns survival planning in Shaun of the Dead. <br/><br/>Overall Ant-Man is a fun superhero flick which excites and makes you care for the characters. It was really close to get an eight from me but some scenes and sequences felt carelessly edited which resulted in an irregular tempo and that annoyed me unfortunately. <br/><br/>Either way worth seeing if like cool action effects, great humor and plenty of connections to the other MCU movies, past and upcoming."

Ant Man was an interesting Marvel character, for a while he had his own half-magazine, then he was with the original Avengers, then he got stuck on big size and was part of the new Avengers (this all about 50 years ago). The movie was mildly interesting through an extended build up to the final climatic showdown, but don't expect wall-to-wall action ala The Avengers. Douglas was fine as Hank Pym and Lilly and Rudd also did well in the leads. I don't know whether this has the ammo to be a Marvel staple but I would consider going to an Ant Man II down the line."
"GeorgeRoots","7","0","2","27 July 2015"," What's Good Is Great, But Could It Have Been Better?
","The end of Marvel's ""Phase 2"", work began on an adaptation of ""Ant-Man"" in 2006 with Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. Wright had unfortunately left the project in 2014, creative differences between him and Marvel has been cited as the reason (A shame as Joss Whedon of ""Avengers"" fame declared it ""Not only the best script that Marvel had ever had, but the most Marvel script I'd read""). Director Peyton Reed was brought on to finish the project, along with more script work by Director Adam McKay and the films leading actor Paul Rudd. At the end of all this unfortunate mess Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish still share a co-writing credit, and while I loved the final movie and its many spectacular sequences I was in my seat wondering how much of Edgar Wright's unique visual flair survived, or what could have been.<br/><br/>Still I will not be rude anymore and give credit where credit is due, Peyton Reed absolutely nailed it. Marvel has managed to actually pull off a thrilling heist movie, and the comedy is a fine balancing act between dialogue and action sequences. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the 1st Ant-man has done well over the years keeping his kit away from those he does not deem worthy. Enter Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a recently released convict planning to clean up his act for the sake of his daughter. Problems arise where he must return to crime for financial reasons and Hank finally sees potential in Scott as the next Ant-man, much to the dismay of Pym's daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly). What follows is a daring plan against an old protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), and with help like Luis (A hilarious performance from Michael Peña) how could things go wrong?<br/><br/>While unfortunately the plot unfolds with moments you have seen done to death in cinema history, the pro's far out way the con's. As a reader of the comic I would have loved to have seen the more arrogant and brutal depiction of Hank Pym that is usually given (Remember that this character accidentally created ""Ultron"" in the books), but Michael Douglas does a wonderful job and as soon as I saw him up on screen I remembered why the man has such a strong presence on camera. Paul Rudd finally gets a break with somewhat serious leading man material and he does splendid with it, I could not agree more with this casting decision. Evangeline Lilly did good as well, but the forced trauma between her character and Douglas's is such drivel I got tired of it pretty fast. It gave minimal depth to their characters, and don't tell me it was powerful stuff when it can be cleared up in a 2-3 minute ""your Mother"" scene every blockbuster seems to have. Stoll as the main villain suits the mood of the movie, but again is underdeveloped and evil just for the sake of chasing profit and spite against Pym (In writing all this down maybe they actually did more justice to Hank Pym than I give them credit for).<br/><br/>So after discussing casting, what redeems this movie for me is how creative all the action sequences truly get (No kidding, quite possibly the best I've ever seen from the Superhero genre). As soon as that suit powered on I was reminded of classics like ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957), and there was even a little ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) nostalgia for me. The CGI ants surprisingly look and move the right way what with the 10, 100's or 1,000's that eventually show up on screen, and after everything I've said the only serious disappointment I had is that Ant-man never got to grow super huge (I'm pretty sure that wasn't a budget thing, and I doubt someone at Marvel would've found it too ""outlandish"" given all the preceding events so far).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Marvel continues to play the game well when it comes to popularising somewhat obscure characters, and every actor delivered on the action and comedy in a smart and clever way. Easily I look forward to seeing this character in his next appearance, and this could be the most fun and accessible movie Marvel has made yet. 7/10."
"switchboard85","8","0","2","26 July 2015"," Surprisingly well done.
","Leave it to this studio to take on something this obscure and absurd and make it work for them. ""Ant-Man"" is one of Marvel's funniest and unique projects to date, and that is saying a lot. The action is exciting and kept feeling fresh all the way through the film, despite pretty much playing the same few tricks from different angles. After the departure of Edgar Wright and what I felt was a slightly underwhelming ""Ultron"", this movie didn't look too promising. However, they've done it again. Marvel still seems to be firing on all cylinders in some respects heading into their 'Phase 3'. Although, the villain (as is the case with most Marvel Studios films) is highly forgettable as written and given what we got, one can easily envision an even better movie if Wright had stayed on to direct. His fingerprints and writing style are all over this movie and that can be a bit of a distraction. All in all, while perhaps not Marvel's best film, this is certainly a welcome surprise."

",". . . in which Marvel and Disney want us to believe that a human being can shrink to infinitely small proportions and not only still be fully functioning, but also have the capacity to return to ""normal"" size no worse for wear. Paul Rudd, as ANT-MAN II, is shown floating in a daze amid a sea of SUB-atomic particles, in a tableau smacking of TRON, FANTASTIC VOYAGE, and THE MATRIX. Not only that, but such a person can communicate telepathically with insects when he's their intermediate size. This gets one to thinking, ""How does ANT-MAN downsize the bubble captions that his thoughts normally occupy, as the regular size surely would explode an ant's brain?"" You may argue that Rudd's thought bubbles would naturally be expected to have microscopic sizing when HE does, but that still leaves the problem of retired ANT-MAN I (Michael Douglas), who habitually sends his full-sized musings about ""One lump or two?"" into his enslaved ants teeny-tiny brain pans. I think the ants behind this flick need to give these points more thought before churning out possible sequels."

","Alright I gotta say and admit as well that Ant-Man is definitely an awesome movie.Some of it's positives are comedy and super cool Vfx of surroundings whenever Scott shrinks.Paul Rudd,Evangelina Lily,Micheal Doughlas do their part really nicely.Movie keeps you throughly entertained like ant-man and falcon face-off and key-chain of Dr. Pym is a f**king tank which on my opinion was one of the most LOL as well as awesome scene of the movie.Backstory of Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyme was covered too.I think that there can be a potential ant-man prequel in which Janet shows up as wasp.But there is an equal probability of her showing up in sequels too.<br/><br/>Altogether it's a lovely ride of MCU not like age of dull-tron which failed in almost every dept. that makes up a good superhero flick.Both Micheal Pena and Paul Rudd did a fantastic job in areas of comedy.If you are a hardcore marvel fan watch it and if not then please watch it.It'll be both worth your money and time.<br/><br/>Do watch mid- and end-credits sequence which shows Hope 'll be next wasp and latter one shows Cap and Falcon found the Winter Soldier a.k.a Bucky and set up a prelude to Civil War."

","Either it was a lowered expectation factor or else they really did deliver an instant classic, it's hard to tell at this stage. I love this movie. Somehow it didn't feel epic enough to warrant a 10/10 perfect rating even though I really can't think of one thing I'd change to make it better. Ant-Man is fun first and foremost. It has true heart and soul and the best humor possible without it being too much. I enjoyed the heist angle and the many surprises that kept popping up throughout its running time. Everything felt more intimate and it was the perfect way to follow Age of Ultron for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Everything doesn't have to be large, grim or of a world-changing flavor. This may signal the perfect way to move forward for their phase three. Deliver large and then small as they rotate between Avenger and solo films. Whatever the case, I hope to see more of Scott Lang as Ant-Man and his entire supporting cast. Everyone was absolutely wonderful in their roles.<br/><br/>I saw this with a group of 15 family members and every last one of them loved it. Kids and adults, men and women everyone was smiling and raving about the film... that doesn't happen often."

","Ant-Man is a welcome respite from the overdriven, mile-a-minute spectacle that the average action film has become. In this movie, dialogue is often relaxed, musical cues generally subtle and the scale far more intimate. Not just small in size--heh, heh--but in terms of spending more time with characters doing normal-people things. Sure, there is high concept science-fiction and the usual corporate mustache- twirling, but those elements are tempered by an overall ""relaxed"" feeling. Great cast, wonderfully inspired visuals, and a different sense of humor. If Age of Ultron (or Transformers, etc) made your brain feel like a chia-pet with sensory overload, give this one a try. It's not great, but it is good, and it's different in a good way.<br/><br/>EDIT: Since first posting this, I have noticed a pattern in the reviews at large. Once again--I've seen it before--the majority of the reviews for Ant-Man are positive, but most of them have been voted not- useful, often receiving ""0 out of however many"" upvotes. So essentially, users who liked this film are taking the time to say a few words about it, and users who either disliked it or simply dislike the positive reviews are downvoting those reviews. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the internet."

","I like how the movie evolves around a father who wants to become the hero his daughter already thinks he is. What I don't like and what broke my heart at the end of the movie is how Ant-man forgets his friend Anthony who was with him till the last breath of his life. We all know that Scott Lang became the Ant-man to win his daughter. I'm pretty sure when Ant-man tells his daughter Cassie about his adventure (where he will have to mention about Anthony), Cassie will ask what happened to Anthony. What is he going to tell her? I don't think a true hero would forget his friends like Ant-man did. Just saying! And I found Ant-man a bit silly at times trying to be funny, which kind of doesn't suit the ""Marvel"" standards. That's only my personal opinion. After all it's a cool movie the whole whole family can enjoy together!"
"joeravioli","6","0","7","22 July 2015"," Ant Man's likable performances and visual ingenuity are hampered by limp direction and overall predictability
","Ant Man is standard comic-book fare. It unfolds in an ordinary manner and pace, each scene focused on narrative reeking of scenes we have seen fifty times before. The hero, a good man who happens to be a societal outcast, is given the chance of a lifetime when he is given a superpower. Being the honourable man he is, he uses this superpower for the good of the world, by preventing humanity from descending into chaos and/or destruction as a result of the actions of one man who is usually blinded by something or other, be it greed, jealousy, or insanity. Along the way, he gets to know (and gets super close to) the hot girl, who has problems of her own. Then he challenges the villain, and manages to escape relatively unscathed for the next battle, in which the villain targets something or someone very close to the hero's heart. The hero shows up, battles the villain and eventually blows him up at the cost of what seems to be his own life. However, he lives, makes out with the hot girl, is accepted by society, and cue credits.<br/><br/>Although I've seen this formula played out on the silver screen countless times, I still came out of the theatre feeling as though I saw something worth seeing. Not because Ant Man's plot was at all engaging, but rather that it had a fine cast of likable characters, novel visuals, and a strangely metaphysical climax scene.<br/><br/>Ant Man stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, an ex-con recently out of prison who is estranged from his daughter, living with three other hilarious criminals who spend their days attempting to pull Lang into one get-rich-quick scheme or another. Meanwhile, scientist Hank Pym is realizing that the world as we know it as pretty much about to end. Coincidentally, he also happens to be estranged from his daughter. Pym recruits Lang to go and save the world. Lang agrees. Clichéd training scenes and character development. Random misplaced action scene. And so on and so forth into boring, predictable, comic book oblivion...<br/><br/>Paul Rudd is funny and likable, and the strange ensemble of characters (including a random Avenger) follow Rudd's lead in giving the film a charming atmosphere, reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy (which I believe is the undeniably best Marvel movie to date).<br/><br/>The visuals of this film are undeniably intriguing, the whole concept of a man who can shrink coming off as entirely novel. Massive bullets fly over Lang's head, trickles of water seem like tsunamis, and ants become, well, man sized. This whole new way of looking at things, however, is hampered by Peyton Reed's limp direction and a predictable plot. The visual novelty comes as a given, never exploited to its full atmospheric potential until the climax scene, which I have to admit was powerfully metaphysical for a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Apparently Hollywood has decided to trade in its magic for lukewarm critical appraisal. So if you go to Ant Man expecting to be blown away by the narrative, you'd better lower your expectations quick because Ant Man comes straight out of the ill-used can of formulaic superhero movies, and mildewy at that. But if you go to it expecting to be charmed by the characters and the strange visual novelty, you'll have a good time."

","Even if Ant-Man doesn't aspire to be much more than your typical Marvel release, the film does mark some significant steps forward for the universe in which these heroes live. When one of the Avengers does appear midway through the film, it actually happens in a surprising way, culminating in a standout sequence that could indirectly lead to at least 2 new heroes joining the roster down the line, while serving as a slick bridge between Avengers: Age of Ultron and next year's Captain America: Civil War. Kudos to Marvel for banking on one of their riskiest projects yet, but Ant-Man still falls prey to the studio's formulaic trappings and – aside from those exhilarating shrinking scenes – feels like a remix of the first Iron Man, Ocean's Eleven and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. It's a fun ride buoyed by some clever action beats and Paul Rudd's natural charm, but the conclusion of Phase Two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't exactly pack the same decisive punch as its Phase One closer, The Avengers.<br/><br/>For the full review, visit my site."

Ant-man blew me away, maybe because I didn't have any expectations going in... but still... wow. My theory is because ant-man is so much lesser known than the other avengers, they put A lot more effort into making this an amazing movie in order to stand out amongst all the great Marvel movies. And now, Ant-man is my second fave superhero after Batman. Seriously, this movie... just... wow. I heard other people speaking my mind when they said ""how did they make this movie so good?""

"daveygandthekeyboard","8","0","8","21 July 2015"," Ant-Man is a Small Gem of a Movie
","""They must REALLY be running out of ideas,"" I said to myself when I first saw a trailer for this movie. Ant-Man? Could Aqua Man be far behind? The Wondertwins? But putting this aside, Ant-Man turns out to be one of the more enjoyable movies of the summer (ok, I haven't seen many). It pulls off the right tone and spirit even though it is a fairly ridiculous premise of a man (Paul Rudd) who uses his cat burglar skills to help an old scientist (played by Michael Douglas) keep his dangerous technology out of the hands of the bad guys. Rudd is pretty well cast, as is Evangeline Lilly as the scientist's daughter.<br/><br/>Ant-Man exists tangentially in the same Marvel universe as Tony Stark, Thor, and the Avengers, but this is not an over the top action movie in the same vein. It exists somewhere between action and comedy, and is a fairly nice blend of the two. The scene where Ant-Man fights an Avenger and apologizes every time he hits him is amusing, as it the climactic battle on top of a Thomas the Train Set.<br/><br/>Sure, Hollywood is always churning out crap, with unnecessary reboots and heroes that don't warrant their own movies. But sometimes they find a small gem at the bottom of that barrel they are scraping. And Ant-Man is a small gem of a movie."

","Yet another one of marvels movies, for the climax of phase 2, and yet another smiling face. Ant-Man is packet with action, humour and easter eggs for the comic readers. However the shirking aspect of the film brings all new perspective and scale to fight sequences. It's a breath of fresh air from the go to beat 'em up marvel film. The film follows Scott Lang on his journey from thief to avenger as he meets Dr. Hank Pym a scientist who is responsible for the creation of the Pym Particle, a substance capable of altering the distance between atoms to shirk and grow things while retaining their mass. An evil scientist named Dr. Darren Cross wants to harness the Pym Particle in order to make miniature soldiers capable of taking down enemies. Of course Hank Pym doesn't like the idea so recruits Lang to take Down Cross. The film follows the same blue prints as most other Marvel films however it's not a stale formula and if it ain't broke don't fix it. The mid credits scene shows Hope Van Dyne taking on her mother mantle as the Wasp and the end credit scene is footage nabbed Civil War, the next chapter in Marvels epic franchise and the beginning of Phase 3. Bucky Barnes has been found and Cpt. America is reluctant to call Tony stark.<br/><br/>All in all Ant-Man is another very good movie from Marvel, I give it an 8/10."

","An expert safe-cracker Scott Lang just been released from jail determined to turn away from crime. But his history makes it hard to get a job, particularly with a threat of never getting to see his daughter Cassie again. He turns to his old crew who had a tip about a safe. They help Scott infiltrate the place and Scott easily cracks it, but it only contains an old suit. Scott gets curious and puts it on. He hits a switch, and shrinks to the size of an ant and hears someone talking to him. His friend Luis unknowingly flushes him out. Returning the suit to the house Scott gets arrested. Dr. Hank Pym meets him, suggesting him to follow instructions. He obeys and again dons the suit provided and escapes by shrinking. Back at the house Scott finds Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne. They ask him to be Ant-Man to stop Darren Cross replicating Pym's research and selling it as a weapon. <br/><br/>First Scott must train with the suit, maneuvering in and out of shrink and controlling ants. Scott progresses slowly, making Hope questions Hank's decision and suggests instead she executes the mission, but Hank denies her. Hank reveals a secret about how Hope's mother died. This helps Hope gets easier on Scott, thus she helps him hone ant control. Last part of training has Scott retrieving Hank's technology from Howard Stark's warehouse, but it was given to The Avengers as their new base. Falcon catches Ant-Man breaching the perimeter. But Ant-Man defeats Falcon by shrinking into his suit and tampering the electronics. That night they find Cross sneaked into the house. He invites Pym to Pym Technologies tomorrow. Cross tells Hope, who's been Pym's mole in Cross' lab, that he's increasing security for tomorrow. Scott suggests an idea to bypass the security, but it needs extra men. They add Scott's old crew of Luis, Dave and Kurt. <br/><br/>The next day, Luis infiltrates as a guard and de-pressurizes water mains where Ant-Man goes in. Cross reveals to Pym he managed to replicate Pym's research and selling it to HYDRA, and that he knows Scot's identity. Cross gets Ant-Man trapped inside a glass jar so Hope blows her cover and aims a gun to Cross. Scott throws an enlarging disk and escapes the jar, igniting a shootout which clips Pym on the chest. Cross flees but Ant-Man manages to damage his helicopter. But Cross manages to wear the Yellowjacket suit and fights Ant-Man. Ant-Man manages to swash the shrunk Yellowjacket but then the police arrests him. Yellowjacket goes to where Cassie lives but Scott manages to catch up. They fight in shrunk condition and Scott takes the risk of shrinking between the molecules to penetrate Yellowjacket's armor and tampers with the electronics. As Scott shrinks even more, he thinks of Cassie and inserts an enlarging disk into the regulator and goes back to size.<br/><br/>It's good that Marvel had realized that with all the other studios following their formula of a shared universe, they need more than superheroes on movies to grab viewers. By that they did a decently good effort in adding another sub-genre to the individual movies, particularly the sub-genres which have a close relevance to the superheroes' abilities or backgrounds. We saw more of a spy movie back in Captain America The Winter Soldier, a Star Wars-like space epic in Guardians of the Galaxy, and now some splashes of a heist movie in Ant- Man (2015).<br/><br/>The movie has the complete compulsory ingredients of a heist movie; a crew, an ace safe-cracker or conman, police interactions, double- crossing, successful and botched plans, and of course some jokes. Yes, as a heist movie Ant-Man is still a far comparison to other more focused ones. But still it's a decently nice effort to even incorporate those elements to attain the strong heist movie flavor in a superhero movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes are consequently littered with CGI all over. But still the movie handled the action well enough to keep it a worthy addition into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One thing that's weird is that when the camera changes perspectives from shrunk to normal size and vice versa, the normal size view seldom offer any difference, making the transitions a little bit nagging.<br/><br/>The movie also faces a latent spotlight on the finale conflict setup. It doesn't offer epic scale destruction and mayhem like what we saw at Battle of Greenwich in The Dark World, or Triskelion's destruction in The Winter Soldier, or the Xandarian skies in GotG, or even the falling Sokovia in Age of Ultron. This movie's final battle instead takes place in a little girl's bedroom. The sub-atomic sequence could really explored a little bit more, or at least they could add more screen time to it. It would show up like the time journey sequence in Interstellar or 2001 A Space Oddysey.<br/><br/>The acting overall is just a little above standards. Paul Rudd's performance here surely isn't his best because his face doesn't really convey much emotion, and so did Evangeline Lily. Michael Douglas did well to liven his character as a mentor. Corey Stoll did well enough to make his villain character stand out, too bad there's little time in his character development.<br/><br/>A score of 7 out of 10 is from me for Ant-Man (2015). A recommendation is a so-so. For me it's an okay addition to MCU, and it's good that the movie has a heist movie flavor. Yet I think it could be done even better."

Instead it is fun but exciting family friendly without being childish and has lead actors that have a good chemistry between them.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas who looks amazingly young in the flash back makes a welcome return to the big screen and his expert delivery of lines makes his character believable. Also well cast is the lovely and alluring Evangeline Lily of Lost fame. She looks smart and endearing at the same time. Paul Rudd has finally found a good big screen role and an action one no less that suits his winning style. Instead of lamer and lamer comedies, the role of Ant Man is just right for him. Corey Stoll is such a versatile actor showing he is just as good as the bad guy (without overacting) as a sympathetic good guy.

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","5","21 July 2015"," Fun, action-packed Marvel adventure
","Here we are with another exciting action-packed thrill ride from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but with slightly more comedic relief than Marvel's previous outings like 'The Avengers' and 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'. This new superhero adventure sees Paul Rudd expanding his talent into the action genre, portraying a tiny- sized hero full of charisma and charm. This time around, Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former con man who is released from prison after serving a three-year sentence for robbery and arson. Upon his release, he struggles with securing employment to reconcile his relationship with his daughter. When he volunteers to participate in a heist with his friend and roommate Luis (played by Michael Pena) and his heist team to steal a bag of money, he ends discovering a mysterious suit and helmet that gives him to power to shrink to the size of an ant. He is soon enlisted by Hank Pym (played by Michael Kirk Douglas), the original owner of the suit who sees potential in Scott to make a difference while fearful of putting his daughter Hope (played by Evangeline Lilly) in danger against the powerful enemy Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll) who possess a powerful suit known as Yellow Jacket.<br/><br/>Upon seeing the trailer, it is understandable to find the concept a bit goofy. But with the Marvel Cinematic Universe expanding widely on the popularity scope, it wouldn't be a fair choice not to give his one a chance. With director Peyton Reed taking the traditional superhero elements and lowering the stakes for slightly more child-friendly superhero extravaganza, this film shines light on the much more light-hearted territory of the Marvel Universe. Playing the titular character is Paul Rudd who demonstrates a signature share of humor and charm in what is arguably one of the most likable heroes in the MCU has to offer. Delivering on the laughter with some gut-busting dialogue, Rudd never lets one moment go to waste, nor does he abandoned his great chemistry with co-stars Michael Pena as his roommate or Michael Douglas as the scientist with the quest to help Scott become the man he always dream about becoming. Then there is Corey Stoll who puts his darkly humorous mask on portray the villain Darren Cross. Though his performance stands strong, the context of in which his character is written doesn't quite the make the most memorable villain we are usually accustomed to in the Marvel films. Like many superhero flicks, this movie also leaves plenty of room for some larger-than-life visual effects that capture the eye in a heart beat. Audience are treated to a fair range of exciting action sequences with some eye-popping, most notably in the scenes when we watch as our hero shrinks down to size and navigates through the exceptionally large environments from his ant-sized perspective. It's safe to say these scenes are fun to watch, and the CGI is credible for this. Concluding the film is an intense, but silly action fight scene between our hero Ant-Man and the villain Yellow Jacket, delivered with an incredible special effects galore, all of which take place in the bedroom of Scott's young daughter; and are immensely fun to sit through.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is a very entertaining addition to the Marvel a Cinematic Universe, and makes a terrific portrayal of our hero Ant-Man to the point where we can hope to see make another appearance not limited to a sequel, but also his debut appearance alongside the Avengers. This film is definitely a must-watch for all Marvel fans."

","Former burglar Scott Lang is enlisted by former SHIELD scientist, Dr. Hank Pym, to help steal a shrinkable battle suit developed by his former company. Desperate to win back his daughter, Lang breaks his vow to never steal again and accepts his offer. In the process, he takes on the role of Ant-Man – a role once held by Pym himself.<br/><br/>And for those of you who want to know, 'Ant-Man' contains TWO end- credits scenes.<br/><br/>Despite it not being as epic or memorable as some of the other MCU origin tales (Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy), Ant-Man is still a wildly entertaining film in its own right. It is funny, touching, and packed with pulse-pounding action scenes never before seen in the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Paul Rudd proves that he is more-than-capable in portraying the miniature protagonist. Much like Chris Pratt and Robert Downey Jr., Rudd bursts out onto the scene with his own unique style and likable personality. Even during his more serious moments (and action scenes), Rudd manages to keep his performance consistent. There was not a moment in this film where I wasn't cheering for his character to succeed.<br/><br/>Both Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly both give strong supporting performances as Dr. Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne, respectively – and should only strengthen the incredible cast of characters already in this universe. The film's villain, Darren Cross, is unfortunately wasted as he comes across as one-dimensional and just plain forgettable. Despite Corey Stoll's best efforts, his character just wasn't given enough development.<br/><br/>The script by Edgar Wright and his team speaks volumes to how much effort they actually put in giving a proper introduction to one of Marvel's more obscure heroes. Unlike some of the studio's other ham- fisted efforts, Ant-Man is perfectly balanced with its drama and humour; there are very few times in the film when moments would be ruined because one side crossed the other at an inappropriate time. The story is also fairly straightforward and tightly focused – no need to worry about Infinity Stones or anything else that doesn't have to do with Scott Lang becoming Ant-Man. The film also contains a number of unexpected instances that will have you and the audience burst out laughing, especially during the action scenes.<br/><br/>I only wonder how this film would have turned out if Wright had directed it instead.<br/><br/>Although I don't exactly consider Ant-Man to be one of the MCU's 'A- class' titles, I can safely say that it ranks far above a majority of its predecessors. Ant-Man truly is a film that almost anyone can enjoy."

","'ANT-MAN': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The twelfth film in the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' is this adaptation of the Marvel Comics' super hero character 'Ant-Man'; who was featured in 'The Avengers' comics, as well as a comic book of his own. Several scenes in this movie are setup for his future inclusion in 'THE AVENGERS' film series, as well as other sequels and Marvel movies. 'ANT-MAN' was directed by Peyton Reed (who's previously only directed sitcoms and comedy flicks, like 'BRING IT ON', 'THE BREAK-UP' and 'YES MAN') and it was written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd (Wright was originally set to direct the film as well). Rudd also stars in the movie, as Scott Lang; a highly skilled thief who takes over the role of Ant-Man, from Hank Pym (played by Michael Douglas). The film also stars Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Michael Peña and Bobby Cannavale. I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it's nearly as good as Marvel Studios' best. <br/><br/>Douglas plays a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, named Hank Pym. Pym was a genius entomologist, and physicist, that created technology, in 1963, which enabled him to shrink in size, but grow in strength (immensely). In present day, he's retired; but he's looking for someone to take over as 'Ant-Man, and continue to use his groundbreaking work, for good. An ambitious former protégé of his, named David Cross (Stoll), has taken over Pym's company; and he wants to use the technology for bad (by militarizing it). Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne (Lilly), set out to stop Cross; who's also known as 'Yellowjacket' (when he's wearing his new shrinking suit). Pym thinks Scott Lang (Rudd), a former systems engineer and crook, is the perfect person to take over, as 'Ant- Man', and help them. <br/><br/>The movie is fun and pretty entertaining, if you like comic book films, but it doesn't live up to the quality of other Marvel Studios' flicks; I think it's their weakest movie (it's even worse than 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD', in my opinion). The action scenes are kind of underwhelming and the whole film just feels like it was made on a much smaller scale (I can't believe it had a $130 million budget). The jokes aren't funny, and a lot of the dialogue is pretty cheesy; as well as the score music. I think the film probably would have been a lot better if Rudd and McKay hadn't rewritten Wright and Cornish's script; and if Wright had directed it. Reed seems like an OK director, but he's no Edgar Wright, and Rudd's comedy skills are definitely not their best here. Too bad Marvel Studios' is so afraid of innovative and original art; they make good movies, but they could be even better, if they actually had some balls!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaTQgKVh7fQ"

","There's no denying the unstoppable success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; eleven consecutive number one box office spots, two spots in the top three best opening weekends of all time, critical success on most films, and an entire cache of eagerly awaited characters have yet to be released. Ant-Man, with good reason, seems to be the only one that people were ready to dismiss. It's a ludicrous concept for a hero who simply isn't as exciting as many of the other Marvel heroes. But the early trailers seemed fully aware of that, and it gave some of us hope. I think it's half the reason Ant-Man just clinched the twelfth consecutive number one opening weekend. But is it any good?<br/><br/>Although filled with typical Marvel humor, Ant-Man seems rather serious right out of the gate- until we are introduced to Scott Lang, a likable loser, which seems to be the typecast character for Paul Rudd. He is casually charismatic, funny but not hilarious. I like Paul Rudd, and I liked him as Scott Lang, but I didn't love him. There was nothing particularly distinct or memorable about him, which could fare poorly for him in future Avengers installments. Still, he was passable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the most of the other characters. Hank Pym, played by veteran actor Michael Douglas, is overly emotional- too quick to snap, too quick to cry, and because he is so secretive about everything, we don't find out why he is this way until much later. His daughter, Hope, jumps the line between good and evil. For a good portion of the movie, she is cold and emotionless, and is if a switch was flipped, she becomes just as much of an emotional mess as her father. The only other character I liked outside of Scott Lang was his buddy Luis, played with enormous energy by Michael Pena, a character clearly designed from the early Edgar Wright drafts.<br/><br/>The worst character in the bunch, sadly, is the movie's antagonist: Darren Cross. While Marvel has managed to turn a few good movie villains, they've also had plenty of forgettable and clichéd baddies, and Darren Cross might be the worst of the bunch. He is a combination of several versions of The Yellow Jacket, allowing for the writers to hit every bad guy cliché in the book- mentally unstable, vengeful, power hungry, deprived of a true mentor/father figure, whose only motivation is to work against the good guys.<br/><br/>The movie is also littered with a number of puns and references to size, which may have worked under the direction of someone as quirky and self-aware as Edgar Wright, but under Peyton Reed's neutral tone, these in-dialogue jokes are not underscored and feel rather lackluster.<br/><br/>Despite the many flaws that Ant-Man carried, I still enjoyed it. The fight scenes take the ridiculous idea of someone shrinking down to an ant-size and actually make it interesting in combat. The movie also touches on some interesting scientific concepts, although it really only scratches the surface. It also is a grounded, smaller story, and feels closer to home for the average viewer. And even though the funniest parts are in the trailers, there is just enough humor to keep the movie mildly funny.<br/><br/>Based on the trailers, I think most people were expecting to Ant-Man to sink or swim, but really it just treads water. You'll laugh at some jokes and sigh at others, and Paul Rudd is just likable enough to keep the movie from being devoid of any interesting characters. And while the villain is downright cringeworthy, the action scenes are entertaining enough to make you forget about those things, even if it's only for a little.<br/><br/>Marvel may play it safe overall as a franchise, but Ant-Man feels sub-par beside the rest of the universe. Perhaps it would've worked in the first phase (which could have allowed for Hank Pym to create Ultron like he does in the comics), and it almost undoubtedly would have felt much more alive if Edgar Wright were in charge. However, it's smaller size is a welcome breath of fresh air in an expanding universe, and for Ant-Man's abilities alone, I am excited to see how he will play out in The Avengers.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","Ant-Man - 7.5/10 Possibly my favourite Marvel film so far, not that i've seen them all yet. I'm sure everyone is well aware of the problems that they came across during the production of this movie with regards to Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish leaving the project due to creative differences. A lot of us were probably expecting a mess of a film which has lots of contrasting elements that don't really work. Well the end product here is as good as could possibly be expected considering the aforementioned problems.<br/><br/>The best things about this film are the things that (you imagine) Edgar and Joe contributed; Quirky comedy, sharp visuals and original set pieces. The other side of the coin would be the predictable plot, derivative villain and contrived links to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It may sound like the 'corporate' direction of the film clashes with Joe and Edgar's original script creating a movie that is tonally all over the place, but that is far from the truth. The end product is a solid, if a little too safe, family friendly action film with a lot of jokes that work really well.<br/><br/>The ties into the MCU are tenuous and there really isn't any need for it but that doesn't let the film down too much. Rudd, Douglas and Péna are all superb especially the latter. Péna adds some much needed comedic flair to the Marvel world and i'm sure a lot of people will be hoping he pops up again in the future.<br/><br/>This is probably the first Marvel film i've watched, other than the X-Men films, that I haven't got really bored of halfway through and started clock watching. Guardians of the Galaxy had good moments but on the whole just bored me to tears. This is a much better quirky comedy attempt. Shame they didn't take more risks with it."
"lesleyharris30","9","0","6","20 July 2015"," Smaller, More Character Driven, Marvel Film that Delights,
","Ant-Man is a brilliant movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic cast. It's certainly some very unique work from Marvel, much smaller in scale and story. It's still very significant to the series, but it's a lot more character driven and less about action, which was nice. It was great to see a more humble story from the studio, that relies a lot more on dialogue rather than special effects. <br/><br/>It has a few minor problems, one being that it sets up future Marvel movies too much, it needed to be its own film a lot more. Though the references to the Avengers are fun, I would have much preferred focusing on Scott Lang and his origins in a more intense manner instead of hearing the characters referring to Iron Man and even mentioning the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>The comic relief in the film is fantastic, I found myself in stitches many times. Paul Rudd has some fantastic lines and Michael Peña brings in big laughs with his performance. With the set up for the movie it would have been ridiculous if it took itself too seriously, so Marvel made a wise choice with director Peyton Reed and writers such as Adam McKay to make it a very light hearted and funny movie. Although there were certainly moments, such as the dramatic scene between Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly, were throwing in jokes took away from the drama a bit too much, but for the most part I think the comedy works out perfectly.<br/><br/>It's not Marvels greatest movie, but they bring in great new characters with a fun and easy to watch story, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or sci-fi film. <br/><br/>An ex-convict must become the Ant-Man, a man with the power to shrink in scale and control ants, in order to save the world, as well as getting to see his daughter again. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Douglas"
"Fludlerk","9","0","5","20 July 2015"," Sometimes, a movie is a pleasant surprise.
","I didn't expect a lot from this movie. Now, I am a big Marvel fan but I'm also picky about the films and there have been a few that disappointed me, but Ant-Man was the opposite. The previews were not well done and I was worried it would be a little too silly, but couldn't resist going anyway. Am I ever glad that I did!<br/><br/>Paul Rudd really pulled off his role well. The arc of his character was so well written, you couldn't help but root for him. He showed me a bit more as an actor than I'd ever seen from him.<br/><br/>In fact, the entire cast did well. If there was a glitch at all, it was in the failed attempt to make Michael Douglas look younger in the opening scenes (there's only so much you can do there) but the acting overall was excellent. <br/><br/>The film was a little more family-oriented than most of the Marvel fare, and it was light in comparison to most, but there was enough of the Marvel storyline to keep the fans engaged and also bring in a younger or less hard-core Marvel audience.<br/><br/>The effects of course, were great. There's always a question of scale consistency when it comes to movies relating to altering the size of objects, but they did a good job of making it work so that you could suspend disbelief and just go with the idea. <br/><br/>Also, if you do see this movie (and it's worth seeing it on the big screen, especially in IMAX) stay till the end of the credits. In true Marvel style there are two epilogues...one at the end of the feature credits, and one at the very end, both of which are great foreshadowing scenes of what's to come in the future."

","Based on the number of ants present in this movie, I suppose we can thank our lucky stars he wasn't called Roach-Man.<br/><br/>Within the vast population of Marvel characters, Ant-Man is one of the goofiest of superheroes, and seemingly the narrowest in terms of functionality. The challenge in the new Ant-Man movie is to effectively explain to the uneducated, non-comic book reading audience what a man shrinking down to the size of an insect is good for. Fortunately, the movie is very good at explaining itself. You don't believe one minute of it, and the logic has holes in it that you could throw The Hulk through, but it makes for an entertaining movie that doesn't drive you away with distracting logistical question marks.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is an entertaining movie that feels like a small anti-chamber off to the side of the vast Marvel Cinematic Universe. It feels like a break from the bigger more serious-minded team ups, focusing on a character that many of us don't really know. Yet, it doesn't feel like a forced entry. True, you didn't hear anyone saying ""Gee, I hope they make an Ant-Man movie,"" but the movie works because of some bold creativity and a script that mercifully doesn't take itself too seriously or drown itself in sad-clown drama. Plus, if you need to be sold on this character, it helps that you have a sharp-witted guy like Paul Rudd doing the selling.<br/><br/>The story opens in 1989 as we see a young Hank Pym (Michael Douglas, de-aged by CG) walking into a meeting with S.H.I.E.L.D. execs with a red liquid in a vial that could change the world (brightly colored stuff in vials always will). The substance is The Pym Particle, S.H.I.E.L.D. wants it, Pym disagrees, the meeting does not go well.<br/><br/>The story then shoots forward 26 years where we meet a good-hearted convict named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who is about to be released from The Friendliest Prison on Earth where he has served a stretch for burglary. He's a crook, but he wants to go straight to have more time for his little girl. But the world won't let him forget that he's a criminal, least of all Baskin Robbins which briefly gives him a job and is mentioned so many times in five minutes that it almost deserves a screen credit.<br/><br/>Needing money for child support, Scott accepts an offer to break into the vault of a rich old man only to discover that vault only contains a red leather suit and helmet. The suit and the vault, of course belong to Hank Pym. The suit has been designed by Pym to allow the wearer to not only shrink down to one-tenth his normal size, but also to allow him amazing strength. This means we get the ridiculous sight of a man the size of a bug thrashing and beating up men who are 50 times his own size.<br/><br/>As silly as this sounds, director Peyton Reed and his screenwriters do a good job of setting up how the Ant-Man suit works and what its advantages are. We spend a good amount of time watching Scott learn how to use the suit and how to talk to ants (yes, talk to ants). Scott has control over the ants because Pym is resourceful enough to have figured out how to make them obey his commands. This actually makes a lot more sense when you're watching it.<br/><br/>The best parts of Ant-Man are the action scenes. I've complained as recently as last week with Minions that I was tired of the smash and bash city battles that take up the third act of a lot of movies these days. This one takes its action scenes to clever new places. Using ingenuity that ebbs somewhere between The Incredible Shrinking Woman and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, the action scenes move within a micro-world that is harmless when you're normal height but terrifying when you're the size of an ant. Ant man is threatened by rats, a record player, a vacuum cleaner, a toy train set, a shag carpet, and a room full of dancing feet. The special effects here are really creative, not just at recycling explosions but creating a world for Ant-Man to play in.<br/><br/>The movie is a lot of fun. It's funny and its dramatic but it doesn't become too goofy nor too broody. Yet, it's not one of the MCU's major achievements. Last year I put Guardians of the Galaxy on my ten best list just for sheer cleverness. Both Guardians and Ant-Man are gambles for Marvel and Disney because they aren't properties that most of the general population are familiar with. They aren't brand names with a built-in audience. It's not as much fun as Guardians nor as dramatic as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it flows at its own speed and with its own sense of humor. It's not perfect, but you'll enjoy it."

","Ant-Man was soooo good! I liked it a lot more than Avengers : Age Of Ultron, and I also liked it more than The Kingsman (I know that isn't MCU, but it does fall under ""graphic novel"" movie). So yeah, we'll have to wait and see how well Fantastic Four does, but so far I think this easily could be the best comic book/superhero movie this year. I had already expected that Paul Rudd was going to be funny in this, and some of the reviews I read confirmed that. And after seeing the movie myself, I agree. But how come there was no talk of Michael Pena? He was so hilarious! He stole every scene he was in. Probably one of the best ""sidekicks"" in a movie.<br/><br/>One of the other things that I liked is that Ant-Man actually got his man and saved the day rather quickly. Unlike the other MCU movies where they seem to destroy entire cities or it takes weeks to get the bad guy, Ant-Man pretty much took down yellowjacket within the same night of coming face to face with him. Like, impressive. And yes, there was damage done, but nowhere near the carnage in other films. It was really refreshing.<br/><br/>As for the villain, I'd have to put him somewhere in the middle. Like, certainly more memorable than Malekith (then again, I think everyone is more memorable than him) and also Ronan, but like just doesn't have that screen presence that Loki or even Thanos has. I'd maybe put him in the same place as Ultron, even though they were both different. Cause I liked Corey Stoll and the fact that his villain (Yellowjacket) was a bit more serious than Ultron was, but at the same time I think Ultron stood out more to me. There was plenty of funny moments in the movie. The train scene in particular (which got a lot of laughs in my theater) was great. But it did also have some touching moments.<br/><br/>But it doesn't mean I didn't see some fault in the story. Like, in one scene where Hope and Scott are training she tells her dad Hank ""I don't know why you insisting on lying on what really happened to mom"". And then practically in the next scene, Hanks decides to tell the truth about how Janet died. Like, I know the writers wanted some way to let the audience about how going ""sub-atomic"" was bad (because its kind of important for a later scene). But it just seemed, I don't know, a little contrived. Like, why would he suddenly tell her the truth now? And also, I think Hank's plan relied a little too much on Scott taking the suit and then later on deciding to try it on. What if when Scott entered the vault and saw there was no cash, just simply left and didn't take the suit? Or what if he did, but never tried it on? Just sold it or something to make some quick cash or something? Did Hank think of that? I just think it was rather lucky of Hank that it played out the way it did. And the other thing that kind of bugged me (although it's a small gripe) is at the end where we find out the daughter has kept the giant ant as a pet. A bit eye-roll inducing.<br/><br/>But overall, it was a really fun movie. It definitely is more a heist film than a traditional superhero action flick, which is neat too."

","It seems that the world is so threatened that we can't have enough super-heroes. Certainly the box office takings of the genre remain so healthy that Hollywood keeps turning them out and the Marvel universe seems to have an endless supply of comic book characters ready for transfer to the screen. I'm not complaining - I'm a fan of the genre.<br/><br/>The style of such movies varies though: fluctuating from dark with brooding, angst-ridden heroes to light with relaxed and comedic heroes. On the whole, I prefer the first category, but ""Ant-Man"" is decidedly in the second. This might have been inevitable, given the fun potential of a titular character with a suit that enables him to indulge in ""organic miniaturisation"" and back in a split second. But I'm guessing that the approach also owes something to the success of ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" which really laid on the humour.<br/><br/>With such levity of treatment, we need the right kind of actor and so Paul Rudd - best known for a host of comedy roles - fills the red-trimmed suit. Michael Douglas adds a bit of gravitas as the designer of the outfit, while his daughter is played by Evangeline Lilly (best-known for her role in the TV series ""Lost""). Corey Stoll is an adequate, but unspectacular, villain. There is cross-referencing of, and cross-promotion for, other Marvel characters which will please fans of the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>Marvel always gives us a little extra after the formal end of the movie and this time there are actually two clips in the credits: one fairly soon into them and the other right at the very, very end. It is very clear that Ant-Man - having somehow survived the ""quantum realm"" - will be back. Should be fun ..."

The ""Ant-Man effect"" is pretty fantastic, and though I loathe 3D (and saw this in 2D) there are a number of sequences here that probably would've been enhanced by it.<br/><br/>Overall a solid and entertaining bit of Summer popcorn fare that should satisfy most people, but it's unlikely to blow anyone away."

","ANT-MAN has never been on Marvel's A list in the same way as The Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor; but neither is he on the same level as Moon Knight. The character is essential to the comic book version of The Avengers, and a stand alone film introducing him to the cinematic Marvel Universe is quite appropriate. And if the movie does not swing for the fences in the same way as the first AVENGERS film or last year's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, it certainly tells its story of with wit, charm and just the right amount of action and special effects.<br/><br/>ANT-MAN is an origin story, which some critics mistakenly believe is the easiest to tell; there have been two heroes to call themselves Ant-Man, the first being Hank Pym, a scientific genius who develops the suit which will allow a man to shrink to the size of an insect, while the second is Scott Lang, a guy who has done a stretch for B&E into a greedy corporation, but who also possesses a Masters in Electrical Engineering. The movie is the story of the latter, who learns from original how to master the suit and the science in order to stop Darren Cross, Pym's former protégé, who is planning to sell the Ant-Man technology to Hydra.<br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is filled with exposition, introduction, and set up, but it's done in a way that doesn't drag the movie down and make it feel like forever until the action starts up. We learn about Hank Pym and why is estranged from his former colleagues and daughter; we get to know Scott Lang, just out of prison and weighted down with a lot of back due child support. And we see Darren Cross racing to perfect what Pym has already discovered, but has hidden away from the world. Over the course of the movie, these three story strands become entwined, eventually leading to the inevitable showdown between Ant-Man and his mirror opposite, Yellow Jacket.<br/><br/>As with all good super hero movies, the story works on more than one level. In one way, ANT-MAN is a heist film, with Scott Lang recruited by an elder to steal from the villains before something bad occurs; there is more than one scene that could have been lifted right out of a classic caper film-think OCEAN'S ELEVEN with super powers. In another way it is the story of family and the bonds that hold and break with the unintended consequences of both: Scott wants to provide for his daughter and keep her love now that she has a new step dad in her life; Hank Pym has had a strained relationship with his own daughter, who is resentful about events in the past concerning her deceased mother; Darren Cross is the rejected son of Hank, while Scott is his worthy replacement.<br/><br/>The casting and acting is spot on, starting with Paul Rudd in the title part; after all his roles in Apatow comedies, he would seem to be a odd choice to play a super hero, but they may have the single one he was born to play. Marvel's heroes have so often been average guys endowed with extraordinary abilities through incredible circumstances; Rudd is the personification of this classic character, especially in the scenes where he is trying to master the Ant-Man suit and his new powers. Up till now, Rudd has never been the big star he should have been, hope this movie changes that. Michael Douglas is perfect as Hank Pym, a once arrogant genius, now humbled by loss; Douglas's bigger than life persona and acting style is just what this role requires. Darren Cross's Yellow Jacket is a Marvel staple-the protégé gone bad and Cory Stoll plays the part well. Evangeline Lilly is Pym 's daughter, who may be destined to become the second Wasp, and having an actor from LOST fits right in to the cast. Michael Pena is always a welcome presence in any movie, here he plays one of Scott's friends from prison who comes to play a vital part in the action. Anthony Mackie's Falcon from the last Captain America movie shows up when Scott tries to break into the Avengers HQ and they have a terrific and very funny fight. Hayley Atwill shows up as and older Peggy Carter, as does John Slattery, playing Howard Stark in a flashback.<br/><br/>The special effects are good without being overpowering, they are used in clever ways to show the unique powers Ant-Man and Yellow Jacket have- like a battle to the death on a toy train set or throw down inside a tumbling brief case.<br/><br/>One of the best things about ANT-MAN is its lighter tone, this is not the X-Men or Spider-Man with their weighty themes of guilt and redemption; director Peyton Reed, who took over for Edgar Wright, does a good job of telling a story about a super hero who really enjoys being a super hero. And I don't miss all those time travel and alternate universe paradoxes from the X-Men films one bit. And listen for the references to the Hulk and Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Of course there are a couple of post credit scenes that advance the story along and set things in motion for the next Marvel movie; the most significant one here, ties up a loose end from WINTER SOLDIER and gets the action rolling for CIVIL WAR.<br/><br/>I cannot wait."

","Marvel has done it again! After what I first considered a lackluster performance with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" a couple of months ago (that film does get better with a second viewing), Marvel has bounced back well with ""Ant-Man"".<br/><br/>A few brief quips about the way this film came together: historically, Ant-Man and his partner the Wasp are original founding members of the Avengers. Indeed, Ant-Man is one of the first superheroes of the Marvel Silver Age of comics in the early 1960's. What's more, the first Ant-Man is always Hank Pym, who plays a much larger role in the Marvel comics universe than he has in the MCU. Pym (played by Michael Douglas in the movie) is actually the creator of Ultron in the comics, which was completely redone for the MCU this summer, an oddity considering that it would have been easy to weave Pym into ""Age of Ultron"" some way.<br/><br/>The point is that this movie doesn't exactly follow its source material very well. And yet, it is told in a way that incorporates the source material such that it treats the comics with respect even if a new tale is being told here.<br/><br/>That said, the film itself is Astonishing! Marvel has taken one of its lesser known, B-role characters and established him as a strong independent hero. The story revolves around Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, who we learn had been an Ant-Man a generation ago, recruiting a new protégé, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) to take his place. The story is an origin tale of both Pym and Lang, combined, and introduces other characters in a way that the Ant-Man series stands on its own apart from the rest of the MCU.<br/><br/>Having mentioned that, it was actually quite refreshing to see an MCU movie where there wasn't an extraordinary amount of overlap with characters from ongoing series. There is no setup for an Infinity War series here, and very little in terms of characters from other films at all (some Shield stuff in the beginning and a brief but fun scene with the Falcon being the exceptions).<br/><br/>The effects in this movie are terrific. It's literally like making a superhero movie out of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids!"". I went in a bit skeptical, even though I like Ant-Man as a character, but the film completely won me over. It has strong, good, well paced story telling (the lack of which was my main beef with ""Age of Ultron""). The acting is good, the plot is good, everything rocks.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping me from giving this film a perfect ten is that in spite of how good it is, and it is good, it just felt a little bit off compared to a perfect ten. Actually, that's not true. It's not that it ""felt off"". It didn't--it far exceeded my expectations. But when I think about a perfect ten movie, I think of a great epic, something that is a film that makes a stunning contribution to film or its genre. I think Ant-Man falls just short of that. ""Ant-Man"" is a superb Marvel film that makes a great addition to the stable of MCU films, but it's not up there with a ""Godfather"" or a ""Star Wars"". It's enjoyable as all get out, but it isn't groundbreaking in the way a perfect ten is. And that's why I've gone with nine stars.<br/><br/>That said, I'd highly recommend this film. There are a couple of bad words in the film, including the ""S"" word a few times, so bear that in mind if you're taking the kids, but aside from that this is a movie that young and old should find enjoyable and entertaining. Well done Marvel, well done!"

","Whilst he had to wait for all the Super Soldiers and aggressive raccoons to have their movies, it's finally Ant-mans chance to make it to the big screen. And in spite of the unfortunate departure of Edgar Wright along with a short production time, Ant-man is still able to continue the style and quality of the Marvel cinematic universe. <br/><br/>Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is a con-man and master thief who has recently been released from prison. Impressed by his skills, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) recruits him to become the next Ant-man. He needs him to pull off a heist to retrieve the Yellowjacket suit, a costume with the same abilities of the Ant-man costume, being developed by Daren Cross (Corey Stroll) who intends to sell it to villainous corporations such as Hydra. Motivated by his desire to see his daughter again, Scott accepts his second chance in life and sets out to carry out the heist. <br/><br/>Whilst they try to raise the stakes at points (Pym reminds us every so often of how the Yellowjacket suit could change the world as we know it) the real charm of the film is in how low-key it is compared to the rest of the Marvel films. It's not some epic battle where the fate of humanity is at stake. Instead it's just a cool heist movie and a nice change of pace from the usual large scale tone used in most Marvel movies. <br/><br/>This low key style leaves a lot more focus on the characters to keep the film entertaining and fortunately the actors were up to the task. Paul Rudd is a great addition to the Marvel Superhero roster by being cool, likable and grounding Scott as a human character through bringing the same comedic skill that we loved in films like the 40 Year Old Virgin (albeit with less ""You know how I know you're gay"" jokes). Douglas is also memorable as his mentor and the original Ant Man, being an interesting take on a retired superhero. Instead of just being old and brooding, he still has the same courage and wit he had in his prime. Plus we get a few cool flashback scenes seeing a younger Michael Douglas (made with very convincing CGI) working as the original Ant- man in his prime, which looked so cool that it made me eager to see Pym get his own movie at some point.<br/><br/>Whilst Yellowjacket did seem to follow all the weak Marvel tropes for villains (rushed back-story, lack of screen time etc.) he was still surprisingly entertaining in the film. Largely because of Corey Stoll who not only gives a great menacing presence, but also plays it so over the top that he brings charm to an otherwise charmless character. The only weak character was Bobby Cannavale as Scott's ex-wives new douchey boyfriend. Mostly because the douchey boyfriend character is one of the most worn out clichés in cinema and didn't seem to have any real purpose in the film other than weak comedy relief. Plus it seems a shame that the film spends so much time with him whilst we hardly get any scenes with his wife and daughter (Judy Greer and Abby Fortson respectively) who are far more important to the story and should have had more screen time. It's especially disappointing Fortson didn't get more screen time since the few scenes she was in were amongst the funniest moments in the film. <br/><br/>However the centrepiece of this film is the action sequences, which contain the most creative fight scenes that Disney's Marvel have had in a while. The size shifting dynamic added a whole new element to the fight scenes visually, taking the usual destruction of a standard blockbuster and placing it inside a children's bedroom. Plus the scenes feel like they have Edgar Wright's fingerprints all over it having clever wordplay and great visual gags making the fights hilarious. <br/><br/>Though that's not to say that the fight scenes are flawless. At times their decisions to have the battles be created entirely with CGI are fairly distracting as most of the backgrounds are blurred out in the miniature scenes. It never ruins the fights, but it can be distracting. And it would have looked a lot better if they had been more creative for some of the sequences and used actual sets for some of the miniature shots. <br/><br/>But at the end of the film the lingering thought did remain, would Edgar White's Ant-man had been better? Maybe it would have been more visually creative. Or maybe it much of Wright was still in the film and it wouldn't be much different. But ignoring what it could have been, the films still great at what it does. It packs in the laughs, has likable characters and does a decent origin story. However other than the fight sequences, there's nothing substantially different here that we haven't already seen from other superhero films."
"WilliamOTyler","7","0","3","18 July 2015"," Ant-Man proves that sometimes smaller is better!
","The end of phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes in a form smaller than to be expected. After the over the top hype of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the film series takes a nice, somewhat calmer change of pace with Ant-Man. It branches off from Marvel proper to create less of a superhero action blockbuster and more of a heist comedy with superheroics in it.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is somehow both epic and mundane at the same time. It's first act is slow, but building, introducing the audience to characters and their backgrounds before they actually meet each other to get the fun started. In some ways, this is more of an actor's film than we've seen from the series, and even manages to fit serious beats into a mostly comedic movie. Michael Douglas is heartwarming, Corey Stoll is fantastic and Evangeline Lilly's Hope might actually be the most compelling female character to come out of the MCU yet. THIS is how you do a badass business woman with a bob correctly. I look forward to seeing where she goes in the future of the franchise.<br/><br/>Of course Ant-Man is also great at ruining those serious moments because the film doesn't take itself too seriously to begin with, which is actually a smart way to get the audience into such an outlandish idea. Paul Rudd has been perfectly cast, balancing the line of silly and sympathetic. It's interesting to note that in addition to having a strong female character, this is probably the most diverse cast in a Marvel film, excluding the many fictional races in a Guardians of the Galaxy. At first this seems great! But then again, this is a heist movie, so it seems unfortunate that diversity really comes in when criminal activity is involved. That being said, this supporting cast is great too, with many funny moments.<br/><br/>Ant-Man is absurd on a level that it should only work in animation where anything can happen, but it's pulled off believably well for live-action. It also feels like a video game, complete with boss levels that need strategic timing to defeat. Once we get into the theatrics that we expect from a Marvel movie, they're still very minuscule and mundane in the grand scheme of things, but they are also bold, beautifully excessive and stunning. When big action scenes take place inside of a bathtub or something as small as a suitcase, you know you're in for something different.<br/><br/>Many complained that Ant-Man wasn't included in the original Avengers movie, as the character plays a major part on the team in the comics. But after seeing his introduction into the MCU, it's completely understandable why they would want to save a smaller film like this for after they've well established their universe. Ant-Man is a different kind of dynamic, though still very wondrous. It's not the big action that you've come to expect from Marvel, but that's kind of the point: to be small, and to be enjoyable as just that. Size doesn't matter, it's all in how you use what you got."

","Ant-man is a comedy action hybrid. The subject matter is not promising but it actually delivers a thoroughly captivating experience. Everything about this film is enjoyable: from the humour to Paul Rudd's portrayal of Scott Lang kicking butt! The movie reworks Ant-man's origin slightly, but not so much that people's dreams are destroyed. The story of the film is extremely entertaining taking aspects of the story from Iron Man. This is not something that hindered the movie however, as the performances of Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly are highly absorbing. The screen presence of each actor really breathes life into each of the characters. Corey Stoll's portrayal of Darren Cross is interesting, although compared to the rest of the acting it is somewhat forgettable. Special effects are very good, and the minimizing scenes are convincing. There are many nods to other franchises throughout the film, and I have no doubt that Ant- Man will be starring alongside the Avengers soon. Overall, I would rate Ant-Man 8 out of 10 because the story is well told, the action enthralling and the characters are charming."
"mattslim333","8","0","6","18 July 2015"," Impressive.
","I love pretty much all the Marvel films, except Iron Man 2, which is awful. They often involve big action set pieces, but Ant-Man is a little different. The action is toned down, and the film is much more character driven, and the movie reaps rewards from this. The characters are brilliantly written and they spark off each other and create chemistry between themselves. This is achieved by a fantastic and quirky script, which Ant-Man benefits from.<br/><br/>Michael Douglas is puts in a solid performance along with Paul Rudd and all the other cast. The acting is very solid throughout the film, and Michael Pena's character is a brilliant and well-written part to the film. Ant-Man has moments of brilliant comedy, which mean the film's 2 hour run time just fly by, the film feels effortless in it's cleverness. Now, to the action scenes. They are few, but when they do come, they are eccentric and feel different in the way they are shot/edited from other films. When Ant-Men shrinks, the difference in scale feels real and this is vital to the film's success and is what provides the action with a different feel.<br/><br/>The problem I had with Ant-Man was it lacked a killer punch in the finale. Even though the final act is good, I feel it lacked a moment to make you go ""WOW!!"", and you usually get these moments in Marvel films. I also felt that some strands of the storyline were not followed up on in the film's conclusion, but maybe they will be addressed in later Ant-Man films, as I presume there will be a sequel.<br/><br/>Overall, Ant-Man is a great addition to the Marvel cinematic universe, and it's eccentric and has a lot to enjoy. It's got it's niggles, but it's great fun and Ant-Man will be a brilliant edition to future Avengers films."

","Marvel does it again with Ant-Man! I was a little skeptical going into ant-man, considering the directors changed around and the fact that the trailers weren't overly exciting. This movie blew my expectations out of the water. This movie was so awesome. The action scenes and CGI was brilliant. It all looked seamless. When Ant-Man is running along with all the Ants, it's super fun to watch. Paul Rudd as the hero was a perfect choice. His humour can be seen in this movie also. Michael Douglas and Evangeline lily were an amazing father and daughter in this movie. (Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne). The villain character was also developed deeply enough to understand his motivations. He wasn't just a typical villain. The way this movie links to marvel universe was awesomely done. Nothing felt forced, everything felt natural. The script and dialogue is also very good, sharp and witty. I had a blast with ant-man!"
"babforest","10","0","7","18 July 2015"," Slow to start but overall GREAT MOVIE
","This is my very first review EVER. So here's my take on it.<br/><br/>I seen many good and bad reviews on this movie. I read some of them before I went. I took a chance and glad I did. Paul Rudd (YOU ROCK!) and cast did an excellent job. Many parts of the movie the audience and my family and I where laughing our butts off. <br/><br/>It's a great movie with AWESOME graphics. I highly recommend going to see it but keep in mind, each of us are different. People will either hate the movie or love it. That also includes people will either hate or love the newest superhero, Ant-Man. You decide. <br/><br/>I and my family, of six, saw this movie in 3D and it was AWESOME!! I highly recommend watching it in 3D. It brings the movie more to ""life"" so to speak. The 3 dimensional look is much better than the standard movies, IMO. <br/><br/>It does start off slow but people have to remember, this is the first movie to many more interacting movies of the Marvel franchise. (I'm sure he'll be wrote in somewhere.) <br/><br/>The writers have to start the story from the beginning so we know how Ant-Man became Ant-Man. The same happened for Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and many others. All of these superhero's had their ""introduction"" movies as well. Most of the ""introduction"" movies are slow to start and/or boring. <br/><br/>It's best to go in with no expectations, as we did and just enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>My kids loved it! Hearing them laughing, saying how much they loved it with excitement. All they talked about today, was the Ant-Man. Telling us to be careful where we step, if we went outside. <br/><br/>To my husband and I, it was money well spent. We all had a great time. <br/><br/>Scott Lang name had been mentioned in a couple of the past Marvel movies.(I found out from a Google search on the mentions) I really LOVE the character and the newest hero to the Marvel franchise. At least we know who he is and I look forward to seeing more of the Ant-Man."
"danmooney-57655","8","0","6","18 July 2015"," Great and fun film
","Overall this is one probably one of the best films of the year so far. Ant-man is a refreshing look on the avengers and has a new interesting tone that we have not seen before in a marvel film with the plot revolving around a heist to stop Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) from releasing his interpretation of Hank Pyms (Michael Douglas) ant-man. Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is recruited to be the new ant-man as Pym cannot continue being the hero following a tragic incident with his late wife forced him to stop. Michael Peña shines as one of Scott's friends who helps with the heist. Evangeline Lilly is a disappointment but has the potential to be a lot better after getting with Lang at the end and becoming the wasp. This heartwarming take on the comic (which I also love) is a nice take on the aftermath of the events on age of ultron. The only criticism I have is yellow-jacket as he is a very generic villain who resembles the first Iron mans villain and does not have much back-story and is not particularly threatening. The main thing I love about this film is the references: when talking about other superheroes they reference Spider-Man, when Lang says that they should call the avengers Hank Pym replies with no they'll just send a city into the sky and Antman has a fantastic fight with Falcon (Anthony Mackie) who also shows up looking for Scott at other points and is in the post-credit scene. This is a fantastic film and I think is better than age of ultron because it is something so fresh and not just more of the same. It is a bit like Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) in a way but is still an amazing take on one of the first avengers. I would recommend this film 100%"

"jmoneyjohal","7","0","6","17 July 2015"," Great Innovative fun, if only the story was more novel than the staple good vs bad... Oh well
","Now I know Antman is an original Marvel comic, but I really believe that when it comes to the movie it must be inspired a bit by the highly successful Telugu, Tamil and Hindi Bi- Lingual film Eega,but thats a discussion for another day. Antman as a stand alone film, when being compared to some other superhero ultra budget high tech films like Avengers, Captain America etc is a rather smaller film in scale but Antman does impress.<br/><br/>Though like many other super hero films Antman also has staple story of good vs bad, and most of the film you can predict miles away,but the films innovative action and comedy make it a very entertaining watch. Watching the Antman fight people much larger, is as fun and innovate as you could think. Director Peyton Reed pulls out all stops to make the proceeding very entertaining. The climax deserves extra marks for being full of great action and comedy at the same time.<br/><br/>Acting wise Paul Rudd surprises big time, as the Antman as he suits the role and excels. I mean a very mediocre actor at best has probably got the role of a life time.<br/><br/>Overall Antman exceeded my expectations as i wasn't excepting much but i actually enjoyed this more than the last avengers, now if only the story was more novel.<br/><br/>3.5/5* or 7/10"
"regula1","9","0","7","17 July 2015"," Phase 3 of the MCU goes off with a bang!
","I would not say this lightly: this film easily rivals Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in terms of quality and fun.<br/><br/>I can't, however, say that they are equal because they are opposite ends of the spectrum. The Winter Soldier is a very serious action film with a little bit of wit and humor thrown in to break things up. Ant-Man is a very witty and fun film with a little action thrown in to justify it being called a superhero film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Scott Lang, an expert cat burglar just released from prison struggling to regain his place in his daughter's life. Dire circumstances and a little unseen intervention forces Lang into meeting Dr. Hank Pym, who in the late 1960s discovered the Pym particle, a particle that decreased the distance between atoms, and was the original Ant-Man. Now older and unable to use the suit, Dr. Pym prepares Lang to step into his suit at the cusp of a dire situation.<br/><br/>This film has just enough Avengers tie-ins to firmly establish it as a piece of the MCU, but it also stands apart. We as an audience has gotten used to the same three (or four) characters interacting in the same universe after having their own origin films. We've forgotten how to react when a new character of equal stature is introduced.<br/><br/>This film is carried by the stellar performance of Paul Rudd as Lang as well as a great supporting cast, especially Michael Douglas's Hank Pym. However, the main villain, Darren Cross, seems a bit shallow in his performance and even the climactic battle lacks a sense of large stakes. Rather, the entire last part of the film seems to just happen with no real emotional investment. It just, is.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Rudd's Ant-Man is a great summer blockbuster sure to rake in millions for Marvel and Disney and it cements itself as a firm anchor for Phase 3 of the MCU to expand. Can't wait for Captain America: Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok!"
"sticks901","8","0","10","17 July 2015"," Ant-Man Movie Review: Comedians do make good Super-Heroes
","Well, Marvel did it again. They took a lesser known super-hero with a strange premise and turned it into a really solid movie. Ant-Man isn't as strong as Guardians was last year, though that may be my love of space adventures talking. It's comes close, and I'm wondering if Marvel will ever mess up again. They can; Captain America The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, and both Thor's, are about it though (down Marvel fan boys, back, back I say). Those are still enjoyable movies, they just aren't at the level of what Marvel has churned out recently. Ant-Man takes us on a great ride, and Paul Rudd hits a home run as the title character. The movie works because Rudd is a believable lovable loser. You want him to become the hero and save the day. We start out with Scott Lang, Paul Rudd, in prison getting ready to be released. He is trying to go straight, but gets roped into helping Hank Pym, played by Michael Douglas. What makes Ant-Man work is the comedy interlaced within the movie. Rudd has his handiwork all over the movie. There are only a few jokes that don't really work in the movie. If Ant-Man tried to be serious I don't think the movie would work. It's weird to think that a movie like this can exist in the same universe as the Daredevil TV series. They both are great, and really work within the larger framework. The technology in Ant-Man is great. Pym created the suit and the shrinking technology. The bad guy, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), is trying to reproduce the technology and sell to the highest bidder. It actually has some decent pseudo-science behind the concept. It is at least somewhat believable. You can definitely suspend your belief enough to think a man can shrink down to ant-size and control millions of ants. The ants are something I did not expect. They are my favorite part of the movie. I loved what Lang is able to do with them, and they add to the overall powers of Ant-Man. Ant-Man truly isn't as strong without actual ants to back him up. They play a big part in the movie and help take down Yellowjacket (Darren Cross). Where the movie misses slightly is in the villain. I really like Corey Stoll as an actor. I loved him in House of Cards, but his villain is just too over the top. It was hard to believe someone as unstable as him running a corporation. I also didn't really buy the interaction between Cross and Pym. I couldn't see them every really liking each other. It was hard to think Pym would have every trusted Cross. They try to explain this away, saying Cross has changed because of the Pym-particles affecting his brain. Pym didn't seem affected, they said he was but didn't go into how he was affected. However Pym was affected they did a poor job of explaining the risks to Lang. Will Lang have to hang up the suit because of some form of brain damage in several years? The other weird dynamic is Hank and his daughter Hope, played by Evangeline Lilly. I didn't quite buy into the emotional issues between her and him. They just seemed a little hokey (I really like that word). Lilly and Douglas are really good in their roles, they just didn't quite have the right chemistry together. Douglas and Lilly however both have great chemistry with Rudd. He plays off both of them well, and all three of them together are great on the screen. Without a doubt Rudd is the star of the movie, and he carries the load. You want him to succeed and become the hero. The plot is well done, and special effects are spectacular. I didn't feel like I was watching a something fake when I saw Ant-Man shrink down. There are some intense and funny scenes while he is shrunk, and it is what makes the movie so enjoyable. It feels like Lang becomes the Ant-Man quickly in the movie. It's a good origin story and didn't feel cliché. I had a great time viewing Ant-Man. It was funny, action packed, and has good characters. You can't go wrong with those three components in a movie. We now have to wait a year for our next Marvel movie. We have a bunch of TV shows to hold the fort until then. I'm looking forward to the next Netflix, show A.K.A Jessica Jones, if it's on the same level as Daredevil we are in for a treat. Go see Ant-Man, it is well worth your time and money.<br/><br/>Check out more of my reviews at http://dowerreviews.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>My Rating: Must Own My top five Favorite Paul Rudd Movies: 1.
