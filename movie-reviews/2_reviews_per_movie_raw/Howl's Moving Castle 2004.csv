","Probably many people find the story confusing. I felt the same way when I saw it in the theater for the first time! The story seemed arbitrary and I couldn't connect the pieces together (much like I saw ""Ashes of Time"" for the first time). But when I watch it again on the DVD, I realize the movie is probably about one thing: personal freedom.<br/><br/>Howl is a free person. He doesn't has a heart and even his home (which is usually characterized as a stable point in one's life) can move :-) He is disguised as different wizards in different counties, and when Sophie asks him how many identities he has, he said ""Enough to guarantee my freedom"". When Sophie confronts Suliman, she comments Howl as ""selfish and cowardly and unpredictable, but he's straight as an arrow. He only wants to be free."" But in Miyazaki's world, nothing is black and white. According to Suliman, Howl's power is too great for a person without heart, and he will eventually becomes a monster (some political figures come to my mind).<br/><br/>Sophie, on the other hand, is bounded by responsibilities. She is young, but her heart is old. She refuses the invitation from her friends and keep working at the hat shop. When her sister asks her ""Are you going to spend your life in that shop?"" She replies ""It meant so much to papa. Besides, I'm the eldest."". Even her sister asks her to ""look out for yourself"". When Sophie is turned to an old lady, it actually set her free because the good thing of being old is that one has ""so little to lose"" She becomes more adventurous and takes control of her life. She is very assertive as being the cleaning lady in Howl's castle and even tames Calcifer to cook her food. For Howl, his turning point comes when he refuses to move his castle anymore (I'll leave it to the reader as why he does that) By the end of movie, he regains his heart. He feels terrible because it is like ""trapped under a stone"". And Sophie says, ""Yes, a heart is a heavy burden"".<br/><br/>There are other wonderful things in the movie. For example, this is probably one of the few movies that tell me what it is really like to be old. But I do want to highlight the thread about personal freedom as it will help you to tie up the pieces of the story.<br/><br/>Since there are 1000 words limit in the comment system, I'll write more in by blog: http://web.mac.com/kenlaw/iWeb/Site/Blog/Blog.html"
"surenm","10","309","353","20 March 2005"," A wild and surreal trip into the mind of a master.
","I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie is that it's highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one's own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.<br/><br/>I think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it's one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.<br/><br/>Also, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki's more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.<br/><br/>If you're looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you're not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream."
"soanim8ed","10","267","309","6 June 2005"," This is art
","Howl's Moving Castle is as marvelous and magical as Miyazaki's other great work. Something in Disney's advertising or the description I read gave the false impression that it was going to be sub-standard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything DreamWorks Animation was doing (Madagascar was sooo pedestrian).<br/><br/>While not as awe-inspiring as Spirited Away or action-packed as Mononoke, it does work on the level of Kiki's Delivery Service as a girl is forced to be better than she thinks she can be (well, that's not a big surprise, that's all his films). And as with all Miyazaki stories, the story teaches without being preachy. And the lessons learned are represented in character changes and in the character's physical appearance as well. It's that same attention to detail that has made Pixar so great.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful. The castle is itself is a mesh-mash of so many haphazardly arranged pieces that an engineer would have an aneurysm just sorting them all out and yet it works. Through magic, of course. The magic being Howl's and the authoritative hand of Miyazaki's direction. The airships (wow, airships in a Miyazaki film? Who would have thunk?) are great variations of one's he's used before and there are some rather dark and beautiful scenes of a world at war.<br/><br/>Most of the voice work was very strong including Christian Bale (Howl) and Emily Mortimer (as the young version of the heroine, Sophie). The voice that surprised me was Billy Crystal as Calcifer, the little flame that could. He's the heart of the castle and only annoyed at his first few scenes then becomes a very likable character.<br/><br/>There a few clunky moments in the plot line where transitions between story points weren't very strong, but overall it's another outstanding film from Studio Ghibli. Even my 40 year old partner, who had spent the day mountain biking, was dead tired and had never seen a Miyazaki film stayed awake for the entire 2 hours. When we left at 3:30 in the morning still jabbering away about all the imagery and meaning, we realized we had seen true art."
"cornishogre-1","10","105","120","10 July 2005"," For those who love the book  or wondered about it
","When I read some four years ago that Diana Wynne Jones had sold the rights for Howl's Moving Castle to a Japanese animator, I wondered. The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.<br/><br/>I'd never heard of Miyazaki. Then I saw Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, The Cat Returns, and Kiki's Delivery Service. Wow. I think Ms Jones and Mr. Miyazaki must be kindred souls. His movies share a lot with her novels  a whimsical sense of humor, impossible to pigeonhole into a category, magic and mischief, and a firm respect for the audience's intelligence. I began to pace the floor in anticipation of the movie.<br/><br/>I saw the movie today. I was not disappointed. The soul of the story is intact, Sophie and Howl and Calcifer are nearly as I imagined them. Yes, there are some plot adjustments. Think of it as the Series 12C version (for those who have read Ms Jones' Chrestomanci books.) The main elements are there, some re-arranged, some changed, yet with a full understanding of the original. Much like the 2004 version of Peter Pan  much was changed, but the soul is the same.<br/><br/>For those who wonder, here are the differences between the movie and the novel. I've tried to phrase them carefully to avoid spoilers for either fans of Ms Jones's work who have yet to see the movie, and those who have seen the movie and have yet to read the book:<br/><br/> Why the witch bespells Sophie<br/><br/> Where the door opens when the dial points to black<br/><br/>Sophie's sister Martha, and the plot line involving sister Lettie are not in the movie  Mrs. Pentstemmon, Miss Angorian, Mrs. Fairfax are also missing, but elements of each are woven into other characters in the movie  Michael (Markl) is a different age  The battles  magical and military  are quite different (but equally spectacular)  The dog appears at a different time, with a different, yet just as mysterious, agenda  The scarecrow's relationship with Sophie is different  Thelevel of technology is different. (I did miss the 7-league boots)<br/><br/>My advice: go see the movie. It's magical and beautiful and funny. Then, if you are a Diana Wynne Jones fan, check out the rest of Miyazaki's films. Now is a great time, as many of his films are available on home DVD. If you are a Miyazaki fan, hie thee to a library or bookstore try Ms Jones' books. (There is a sequel to Howl's Moving Castle  Castle in the Air.)<br/><br/>And enjoy!"
"WritelySo","10","143","171","23 February 2005"," My favourite Miyazaki!
","What an amazing achievement! This is by far the best example I have ever seen of animated characterization. The expressions and the nuances and the emotion captured in this film are truly breathtaking. I love all of Miyazaki's work, but in Howl's Moving Castle he has managed to take it to a level that to me sets the standard.<br/><br/>It has all of the classic stunning Miyazaki panoramas, rich settings, exciting and unusual machinery, and brilliantly conceived creatures that are often humorous and fanciful. The characters are all very expertly crafted and developed, but what really enchanted me were their expressions and the subtle but powerful ways that he chose to elaborate on their connections and emotions. It is very difficult to describe, but they come to life in such a powerful way as to seem entirely real and unique.<br/><br/>He achieves this within the medium - not by really imitating or parroting film or live action, but by artfully exploiting the medium to enhance and capture the subtle interactions that make up relationships. He shows his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling by carefully chosen gestures and facial expressions, rather than relying always on dialog, etc. I was completely swept away by this skillful use of animation - I have never anywhere else seen anything that begins to come close to it.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic - I haven't read the novel, but it had all of the elements I have come to enjoy in Miyazaki's work - there is the humour, the lighthearted moments, the strong, insightful, loyal, and honourable characters, the lyrical drama and action sequences. The pace is perfect - it flows nicely and is always exciting, suspenseful - I got very caught up in the characters and their struggles and hopes. The themes were expertly handled with Miyazaki flair - and always richly meaningful and perceptive.<br/><br/>I can hardly wait to see what this brilliant artist creates next!"
"life_on_screen","7","245","328","12 January 2005"," Terrific Miyazaki, although not his best
","""Howl's Moving Castle"" opened here in France on Jan. 12th (as ""Le Château Ambulant,"" natch), and I saw it at an avant-première. As a raving fan of Miyazaki and of Diana Wynne Jones, I feel lucky to be an American living in France -- I see there's no release date announced yet for the U.S. Sorry, folks, and blame Disney! <br/><br/>I understand the feelings of viewers who have criticized the movie as trite. I find it's less imaginative, in terms of character development and emotional profundity, than Miyazaki's best masterpieces. However, even a pedestrian Miyazaki movie is infinitely more rich, frightening, imaginative and humane than any six Disney films put together, and there's a lot to love in ""Howl's Moving Castle."" <br/><br/>I am glad I didn't reread Jones' book before seeing the film; even going on my six-year-old memory of the novel, I can see the movie's a very loose adaptation, and I think Jones fans would do best to try to take the movie on its own merits instead of looking for a faithful adaptation. That said, Miyazaki is surprisingly successful, at moments, in capturing the richness of the novel's characters: the peculiar co-habitation of charm and terror in Howl the sorcerer and his demon companion Calcifer, and the pragmatic strength of will that makes us love Sophie, the protagonist, who embodies both the fairy-tale archetypes of the young girl and the old woman at once.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's directorial trademarks are here in spades. Most of them lend strength and power to the film: his passion for open landscapes, his vision of the power and horror of war, the uncompromised way his movies work to empower children, and especially girls. A few of them are just Miyazaki quirks that fans will recognize with amusement (walrus mustaches, cobbled European squares, and flying machines for everyone!) Richer and stranger, though, are the very successful integration of two things that Disney animation never even approaches: the way even a children's story can blur lines between an enemy and a friend, and the cohabitation of the monstrous and the sublime. Enemy, ally, monster, beloved: Miyazaki gives both visual and moral weight to these disturbing contradictions, and certain scenes in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" evoke a frightening sublimity I have never seen elsewhere than in ""Princess Mononoke."" <br/><br/>I think the film suffers from a slightly hurried pace, especially with respect to the protagonists' character development, and the result is a loss of the subtlety that makes Jones' book such a gripping fairy tale. Her Howl is more ambivalent, and her story is a more complex investigation of adolescent heartlessness and the growth of the heart. The ending, which falls back too much on clichéd imagery and deus-ex-machina, also could have been better handled. All that said, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" contains lots of treasures and will, I think, stand up to repeated viewings. Miyazaki fans will be delighted, and kids around the world should be given the chance to taste this latest rich, respectful children's tale. (Be warned, though: there are moments as terrifying as those in ""Princess Mononoke,"" and younger kids will need their parents with them.) <br/><br/>On a final note, as few hardcore fans of Japanese anime will need to be reminded, the movie is doubtless best seen in its original version with subtitles. The Japanese voice acting is terrific -- although the voice of ""young Sophie"" doesn't strike me as anything special, the actors playing the aged Sophie, Howl, and especially Calcifer are fantastic. Calcifer is a magnificent creation and should delight even the most conservative fan of the novel. I have serious doubts that the inevitable English-language dub will do the nuances justice."
"Andrea_R","10","203","275","1 October 2004"," Thank you so much for this movie Mr. Miyazaki
","I Don't get words to express what I felt when coming out of the cinema, Howl's Moving Castle is an absolutely fantastic film and has even out Laputa and Totoro as my favourite Miyazaki film.<br/><br/>The story is amazing and the characters and creatures are as excellently crafted and fun to watch as ever. The voice actors and music are perfect Joe Hisaishi in my opinion is the best contemporary composer.<br/><br/>My only criticism (very little) is maybe the ending (last minutes) that rises suddenly, far from the habitual perfection of the catharsis final of the Miyazaki's films but nothing important<br/><br/>The movie has a really bad thing of the film: THE LONG WAITING TO SEE IT AGAIN!<br/><br/>ESSENTIAL"
"whitetigah","9","148","198","6 September 2004"," Another wonderful movie from Miyazaki
","(first of all: sorry if my English is not the best out there, but it's not my native language)<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see the world premiere (at Venice Film Festival, September 5, 2004).<br/><br/>Not only the art and animation is breathtaking (with almost no CGI), but the story is also above Miyazaki standards.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful, each one with his (or her) own personality. Among them the best is for sure Calcifer, the Fire Demon, who is actually an almost all-powerful being, but is often underestimated by the other characters (""If you don't obey, I'll pour water on you!"").<br/><br/>The music is one of the best parts of the movie. Even if you don't notice it, it is always there, always conveying the right feeling.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is an excellent movie. If you liked other movies by Miyazaki (such as Mononoke Hime, Spirited Away, Laputa Castle in the Sky...) you cannot miss it."
"chsorley","9","27","33","27 September 2005"," They tried to save each other ...
","I saw this twice, because there was no way I could understand the plot (especially in the second half) after only seeing it once. The first time around I got too carried away watching the animation, but the second viewing helped me understand the story a lot better, as I managed to pay more attention to all the dialogues.<br/><br/>Honestly though I still don't know exactly what happened in the last half an hour or so. I'm going to read the book, and I'm sure I will enjoy it but don't know how useful it's going to be. The film's said to be wildly different from the original setting.<br/><br/>It really doesn't matter, because I don't seem to mind seeing the film once again (& again). The animation is so beautiful & I find the characters cute gorgeous, funny & very heart-warming.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I figure that the face of the old Sophie changes & she instantly looks younger when she feels excited / happy / alive, even as a very old woman (she looks young when asleep, but I wonder if it's only in Howl's vision).<br/><br/>It breaks my heart that she looks sad & immediately turns back into the old Sophie when Howl tries to tell her sincerely ""you are beautiful"". But then both Howl & Sophie must fight the war to save each other & the rest of their newly-formed family incl. their old enemy & the dog. The curse is already gone by the time Sophie comes back to present from the past through the door, finds the wounded Bird Howl & kisses him. She won't look old any more.<br/><br/>Still, I also like the fact that earlier in the film, after the initial shock, Sophie was clearly able to enjoy herself being old. Think she was already in love with Howl when he came back to the Castle & found her, but she didn't have to be nervous or anything because she knew she was no longer a shy 18-year-old.<br/><br/>And Sophie's first encounter with Howl in the back street ... did he say ""There you are, SWEETHEART""? Has he actually been looking for Sophie ever since he (as a still very young boy) saw her & heard her cry FIND ME IN THE FUTURE. That's clever, and most romantic."
"deegola","8","85","126","23 February 2005"," I really enjoyed this film!
","It's hard to make any movie that follow after 'Spirited Away' So, when you watch, you have to try and keep an open mind....which is hard to do since the characters, and the whole feel of the film seems so much like his previous works.<br/><br/>But what fun this film is! And interestingly beautiful. I could watch most any of his movies, just to look at the beautiful scenery. I love some of the incredible imagination that goes into his works.<br/><br/>I could easily recommend this film. No, it's not the better than the rest, but I feel it's definitely worth your time.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing the film again, maybe I will understand some things a bit better."
"chiarasf","9","112","170","14 September 2004"," A poetic anti-war cartoon.
","In a time of war and falsity here it is a dancing poetry from Japan against all the cruelty and pain. The moving castle leads us to a magic place where life has a strong value and elderly people have an important role to play. Also in an apparent hostility or in a scarecrow, Hayao Miyazaki gives us the chance of finding a friend and not letting the dream go down. The perfect technique and the emotional stream are in complete harmony. If the jury of the Venice Film Festival had been more far-seeing, it would have given a more prestigious prize to this masterpiece."
"ngchiho","10","17","24","30 July 2005"," Look in an another view point
","Since 1984, that 20 years ago, I have watch every movie Miyazaki make and mostly on cinema. Howl's is a long wait for me since the Spirit Away. After I seen this movie, it is still very enjoyable to me but there is something in my mind still questioning. Miyazaki want to tell us a love story, that we are sure but may be there is some more. After i read a local film review, the question is entirely clear now I seen this movie into another perspective.<br/><br/>Yea, Sofi is the main character and the story are spin around her adventure. However, Miyazaki seem want to look into the aspects of modern Japanese man through Sofi view point. Howl is a powerful wizard; however his life is not as happy as other thinks. Every success had a price. He was chased by 2 waring parties who want to own his power, he living in a mess inside a moving castle which was keep hiding from one place to another place. Only thing that keep him going is his great style of hair and the believe that he is looking handsome. That why Miyazaki choose Takuya Kimura as Howl casting, in fact, Kimura is a top idol star in Japan which is share a similar burden as Howl, he is handsome, he is popular but he is not free, all the decisions are subject to his manager company, he could not date a girl openly. Yet Kimura married Kudo Shizuka despite all the opposition from his manager company. That strike the similarity that love shall triumph all. Even the war could be stop and the teacher of Howl would not stop him at the end."
"AloysiusWeasley","10","12","16","23 October 2007"," One of the best animated movies of ALL TIME - classic status, STAT!
","First off, if you're at ALL a fan of animation, Studio Ghibli, or even just catching a movie that will bring you back to times when things were simpler and people weren't just up for the 'snatch and grab and screw everybody else', you need to see this movie RIGHT NOW. I will admit to being biased, since this *is* my favorite movie of any (animated or not), but honestly, whether you're 7 or 70, this movie is a guaranteed delight. Every time I see this movie, I'm immediately overwhelmed by feelings of wonder, delight, creativity, and hope, and I must say I've definitely seen this movie over 60 times. It doesn't get old, and it's one of those movies where every time you see it, you see something new in the background you'd never noticed before.<br/><br/>Okay, on to actually telling you about the movie! The animation and musical score are so far above average it's not even funny. I could watch this with it on mute, and I'd still be struck by the wonder of all the scenery, and the excellent emotional responses of the characters. I could listen to the music from this for HOURS, and if you're any sort of creative person (writer, poet, musician, artist, etc.) it WILL inspire you. Also, I haven't seen the subbed version yet, but unlike many dubbed anime, you will NOT feel like you're being talked down to! <br/><br/>Now, this movie is based on a book by Diana Wynne Jones. This is one of the handful of movies where I've watched before I read, and unlike most book to movie adaptations (I loathe nearly all of them), this movie stands on its own with excellence. The book is most certainly a bit different (you will get more of a background on the characters and plot), but for once, I can actually say I loved both equally. It's not necessary to read the book first by any means, but make sure you don't neglect to do so! As a writer, I work with words and their nuances constantly, but even I have immense trouble trying to find words to describe the utter fabulousness of this movie! I'm honestly trying to take a step back and take a critical look at it, but there are NO flaws, no things I would have improved. I wish this movie had actually been released to the public to see in the theaters (I would have had to drive 7 hours to see this when it first came out, and I live very close to a large city - we're talking practically NYC and LA release only!), so many more people could have been struck by the wonder this movie inspires.<br/><br/>So if you need an uplift, rent this movie ASAP. Better yet, buy the DVD - it is quite difficult to obtain outside of stores that specialize in anime and the internet, but it is VERY worth it - the DVD has awesome extras and lots of artwork used in the creation of the movie. I PRAY this isn't the last movie Hayao Miyazaki directs!"
"scififan_uk","10","15","21","27 September 2005"," Amazing!
","First, I must confess that I have never seen Spirited Away so I cannot make any comparisons. Second, I must say this is one of the best films I have ever seen!<br/><br/>What made me enjoy the film so much? The imagination, the romance, and the realistic way Sophie is portrayed - her insecurities, how she copes when she is cursed, and how things change physically as she is transformed into an old woman. And then there's the humour - the Witch of the Waste was hilarious! I never thought I could be so taken by a children's film, but I enjoyed the movie so much I went back and saw it 3 more times, which I've never done before.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend Howl's Moving Castle."
"jotix100","10","19","29","2 July 2005"," Hayao Miyazaki casts his spell on us
","The genius of Anime films, Hayao Miyazaki, shows why he is one of an absolute masters of the genre. Taking Diana Wynne Jones' story ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and creating the magnificent film for our delight, is something that no other man could have accomplished with as much flair and panache as Mr. Miyazaki has done.<br/><br/>The film has such a great look that at times we wonder if one is really seeing an animated film, or not. The images we watch on the screen have such detailed and rich look that we wonder how did Mr. Miyasaki could have accomplished it.<br/><br/>Not having seen the Japanese version, the English one that was released here offers great voices to go along with the many characters in the film. The big surprise was Jean Simmons, an actress we haven't see much lately who does a great job with the older Sophie. As the young Sophie, Emily Mortimes is wonderful and her voice suits the character so well. It was also a stroke of genius to have cast Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, as she seems to be having a great time acting her. Billy Crystal was delightful as Calcifer and Josh Hutcherson is perfect as Markl. Christian Bale is an amazing Howl. In minor roles we hear the voices of Blythe Danner, Crisping Freeman and Jena Malone, among others.<br/><br/>This Anime film will delight young and old fans of Hayao Miyazaki who can look forward to a great time at the movies with this film."
"cursedgnomes","10","12","17","8 March 2006"," Best Ever
","This movie was absolutely perfect. The animation, the voices, the acting. Everything. <br/><br/>Sophie is a girl who does things because she is expected to, not at all because she herself wishes to. When the Witch of the Waste turns her into a ninety year old woman, she immediately sets out to cure her curse. She chances upon Howl's moving castle, and after striking a deal with the fire demon Calcifer, she becomes the new cleaning lady. Fraught with adventure, wizardry politics (of a sort), and endearing romance this movie has everything.... I only wish it were longer. Or for several more just like it. <br/><br/>If you haven't read Diana Wynne Jones' perfect fantasy novel, you should, and read it before you watch this film (if you can wait that long). It will help you in understanding the movie to it's full extent. I was at first afraid that Miss Jones' novel would be turned into something wholly unrecognizable, and without any of her original humor. But Miyazaki captured all of her characters beautiful, and was able to make a great movie, without losing any of the characters' original charm.<br/><br/>***spoiler alert***<br/><br/>My spoiler is for concerned parents, who might wish to know if anything could be considered objectionable for young viewers' eyes. I can name a few things at least. The battle scenes are not particularly horrendous or frightening, except for the black blobs that come after Sophie and the other characters. There are 'mad wizards' who have turned themselves into 'demons' for the war effort, and they attack Howl a few times. There is also a scene where Sophie has a vision/dream of Howl in a monster like form, and he has scary looking teeth. Madame Suliman is a strange 'head wizard' sort of person, who almost viciously destroys any wizards who stand in her own/or the war's way, and there is a scene in the film where she hypnotizes Howl and begins to turn him into a 'monster' so she can steal his magic and, as it appears this way, kill him. This scene in particular might be frightening for very young viewers.<br/><br/>***end of spoiler***<br/><br/>All in all, I did not find these things particularly frightening, and upon viewing the film yourselves, you might find it perfectly harmless. Nevertheless, I advice that you watch the film yourselves before showing it to your younger children. Older kids shouldn't have any problem with it at all.<br/><br/>This movie deserves more then ten stars. And I think the Oscars should give more awards to animated films then just Best Animated Film. They should start doing best Director of an Animated Film, best voice acting in an animated film (male and female naturally), and best animated film soundtrack. If they did that, more people then just California would tune in to watch.<br/><br/>All the voices were excellent, and the animation superb.<br/><br/>From start to finish I felt it was exactly what I had hoped for and wished it could be. Thank you Hayao Miyazaki-San for a truly great film."
"moratt","10","12","17","12 December 2005"," Overwhelming and beautiful
","To me the movie was simply stunning. I have seen most of Miyazaki's movies and still enjoy this one as much as any of the others. Yes, I agree that quite a few of the ideas have been used before - but not in the same context. I disagree that the faceless ink-like servants are anything like 'Null-Face' from Chihiro, and the overall feel of the movie is very different. <br/><br/>The Ghibli trademark of beautiful landscapes is here in large amounts, some of them will make your eyes water with longing for being there, making the images of war even more gruesome.<br/><br/>Some parts of the movie may seem confusing to children and adults alike. It's a bit like a good poem: You might not understand it entirely, but it feels right. Leave daytime logic at the doorstep, this is a fantasy made from images of your childhood dreams and with the same surreal logic.<br/><br/>The war in 'Howl's Moving Castle' is largely unexplained. It is simply going on, killing and destroying. Had this been a Disney movie, we would have known the reason for it and probably even sympathized. Here it is only hinted at, which may seem confusing. But it is entirely on purpose: War IS meaningless, absurd, unnecessary, if you ask Miyazaki. <br/><br/>If you want straightforward action, good and evil easily distinguished and distilled into separate characters, skip this one. Skip any of Miyazaki's movies. Good and evil are present in all his characters. There is no villain to hate, apart from war and greed itself which always ruin people in Miyazaki's world. But oh, what a world that is."
"Raven_Summersong","10","16","24","14 June 2005"," A fantastic fairy Tale from Miyazaki
","Howl's Moving Castle is another addition to the magic of Miyazaki's long list of masterpieces. Based on the book by Diana Wynne Jones, the film takes the basic premise of the story and takes it into a new direction.<br/><br/>The basic story is this: 18-year-old Sophie is a hatter who believes she is an ordinary nobody. But when the witch of the waste curses her to be trapped in the form of a 90-year-old woman, Sophie must go on a grand adventure to find a way to break the curse. Along the way she meets a strange cast of characters including the living scarecrow affectionately dubbed ""Turnip Head"", a wisecracking fire demon, and a mysterious and tragic wizard named Howl.<br/><br/>Fans of the book will realize right away that Miyazaki takes great liberties with the source material. While I found this fine, (as the film weaves the tale in a splendid fashion) I did wish that perhaps he had titled the movie differently and added ""Based on Howls Moving Castle"" as the film is more a taking of the IDEA of the book and using it to form a story, than a faithful adaptation of the novel. However, the changes Miyazaki makes works for the film brilliantly, and I have found I like the movie and the book equally.<br/><br/>A tale full of magic, romance, excitement, and wonder, this is a highly recommended film for lovers of fairy tales and mythology, as well as Miyazaki fans. It will engage both young and the young at heart."
"WizardX","7","95","178","18 January 2005"," Somewhat disappointing
","I'm a big fan of Miyazaki's work, and having seen everything else he's done, I had to see Howl as soon as I could locate a subtitled version. Unfortunately, I must rank it among his weaker efforts. It's certainly not a BAD film - I don't think the man is capable of that - but after the brilliance of Mononoke, and Spirited Away, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The big problem, putting it bluntly, is that the movie makes no sense. It's possible the fansub I was watching mangled it, but I can't imagine a way for the script to be written to make the events cohesive. It takes the dream-logic of Spirited Away, but takes it to a point that it becomes nearly impossible to get ""into"" the movie. With Spirited, you always felt like there were rules to the world, even if as an outsider you didn't understand them. This never seemed the case with Howl.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Miyazaki seems to have dipped into his bag of stock tricks a bit too often. There's little in here that you haven't seen in some form in his previous films. There doesn't appear to be anything new he has to say with this film, it's just retreading the themes that have run throughout his work. I could easily forgive Mononoke as being a thematic remake of Nausicaa, since I feel his message had grown sufficiently in the decade separating those films to be worth repeating. That's not the case here.<br/><br/>But, as I said, it's still not a bad film. I suspect people who haven't seen all of Miyazaki's canon will find it quite enjoyable. The richness and nuance of his character animation continues to grow. No one makes more expressive animated figures than Miyazaki, and the characters alone nearly carry the film. And supported by another wonderful score by Joe Hisaishi, as in all of Miyazaki's works, there are moments of staggering beauty rarely seen in films of any genre or style.<br/><br/>And despite the incomprehensibility of the plot, he makes it compelling and watchable, even as you have no clue what's going on or why.<br/><br/>So, I give the movie an above-average rating and a recommendation, simply on the strength of being a Miyazaki film. The worst of his movies is still better than just about anything else out there. But the purists are likely to be a bit disappointed."
"fwomp","3","37","64","5 June 2006"," Loose Ends Ruined It For Me
","Having little experience in the Anime realm, I have to admit I'm probably not the most knowledgeable reviewer to examine a film such as this. But what I DO feel I'm fairly qualified to do is to evaluate stories. Animated or not, films are a valued method of reaching out to viewers and creating entertainment.<br/><br/>Although HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE had some great animation and interesting concepts, the story was so nonsensical in so many places that I found myself shaking my head wondering why I was watching it.<br/><br/>The story (if I'm not mistaken) is about Sophie, a young milliner (hatmaker) who lives a mundane life until she's afflicted by a curse put upon her by the (initially) evil Witch of the Waste. The curse comes in the form of age, turning Sophie instantly from a vibrant young girl into a ancient old hag. In order to break the spell, she must find Howl and his moving castle. But with the curse comes the added insult that she cannot tell anyone about it. So once our heroine meets up with Howl, she's unable to tell him what she needs and instead becomes the moving castle's housekeeper.<br/><br/>Within the house she finds a young boy who wants to be just like Howl. She also meets and befriends the power that helps keep Howl's castle constantly on the go: a type of fire called Calcifer. And with the castle comes a multitude of problems: Howl's carelessness and difficulties of ""the heart"", a war against outside forces, and the threat of the Witch of the Waste.<br/><br/>Again, the animation in the film was great. It was excellently colored and moved in an almost Van Goghish fashion across the screen. But oh the story! There's never an explanation given as to the war that is constantly circling this strange land. Why and how it got started are never fully explained, even though much screen time is given to the machines of war. Why and how the young boy who lives in Howl's castle came to be there are never explained either. Nor is any explanation given to the powers of Calcifer, the fire that drives the castle (the ending touches on it slightly but very ineffectually.) There are plenty of other non-sequiturs but those are the biggest. Too bad, really, as there were some great voices amongst the cast ...from Christian Bale, Billy Crystal and Lauren Bacall just to name a few.<br/><br/>I don't mind films that leave a certain amount of exposition up to the viewers interpretation, but there needs to be some rhyme and/or reason for the basic constructs of a movie. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE left me howling for too many explanations."

","A very cinematically beautiful film with characters you just fall in love with. I won't lie, the plot is very hard to follow. If you've read the book, you can tell that miyazaki focused less on following the plot, more on making the film beautiful to watch, and as a result we are left with a story that has huge chunks missing and frankly doesn't make a lot of sense in places. But I'm not mad, because it is very, very beautiful to watch."
"thesouthernpansy","9","8","11","11 June 2005"," Wow, excellent!
","I just returned from seeing the Japanese version with English subs thanks to an International Film Festival and I have to say... Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli crew do not disappoint with this one. Whether you're a Miyazaki virgin or a devoted fan, this film is all-around excellent and I'm definitely planning on seeing it again. Perhaps the English version the next time around.<br/><br/>One of the things that stood out for me the most was the sheer volume of references to his other movies that were included. Half the fun was picking out scenes and characters that echoed ones in Tonari no Totoro, Spirited Away... quite a few, really. The movie was laugh-out-loud funny all the way through (the whole theatre was in hysterics) and they did an excellent job of balancing the humor with the drama so that neither detracted from the other. There was one scene closer to the end that I was a bit confused on involving the castle, and one of the overarching plot themes involving a war seemed to be lacking motivation, but otherwise there weren't any plot nitpicks. I'm very interested in reading the book now--those who had read it seemed to think the movie adaptation was pretty faithful.<br/><br/>Aside from the feeling that maybe Miyazaki should branch out from the 'young girl coming-of-age' story, I very much enjoyed the characters. The heroine, Sophie, is likable both as a teen and an elderly woman, and as with many of the other characters, it is interesting to see her character (both physically and mentally) change throughout the story. The dynamic characters definitely kept the pace moving and even seeming-villains could become likable in a matter of minutes without seeming forced. And for you anime fangirls out there... yes, Howl is a bish. A very likable one too, even as he's complaining about his constant need to be pretty. He's another very dynamic character and one that I enjoyed watching immensely.<br/><br/>You must see the movie for yourself to really appreciate what Studio Ghibli has done this time around. Employing a visual style much closer to Spirited Away than to former works, their constant creativity is astounding. Howl's Moving Castle is a masterpiece that ties the family of Miyazaki movies together, yet stands on its own as a true work of art. Run, don't walk. And I mean it. I was wearing heels."
"juska-lampela","8","47","88","24 January 2005"," Routine work from Mr. Miyazaki
","The more you've seen Miyazaki's films, there is a chance you'll less likely enjoy this movie. Why so? Because you can familiarize almost every single element from his previous works in Howl, which is actually quite strange. Before Howl his films were ALWAYS unique and new, when compared with the ones he had made before. But in Howl we can (at least subconsciously) easily compare those black liquid shades chasing Howl to Spirited Away's No-face and the whole ambiance stands somewhere between Kiki and Laputa. Not good.<br/><br/>If you take all those before seen Miyazaki trademarks away, the entity of the movie is frankly said quite fragile; Mages used as part of the military machinery. I haven't read the book version of Howl, but for the movie part I can say, that it is a very traditional piece of Ghibli and also has a worn-out story. The original and thus powerful themes we saw in Mononoke and Spirited Away are gone now, and have been replaced with the used ones: war and love. So ""unmiyazakian"".<br/><br/>Yet I'm quite sure that I would appreciate Howl a whole lot more, if it was the first Ghibli, and above all the first Miyazaki-manufactured movie I've had ever seen. The technical asset of Howl has been substantially improved and Hisaishi's score is once again a top-notch personal performance. The usage of 3D-imaginery has been increased, but the animation is still 99% hand-made, which I naturally appreciate. The characters have variable personalities and especially Witch of the Waste had something, that this movie truly needed.<br/><br/>Maybe Mr. Miyazaki shouldn't have done a book adaptation in the first place, since his purely imaginative mind is meant for bigger things. Instead of ""loaning"" ideas from others, he should be the only source of inspiration, when preparing for his new project. I sure hope that Howl won't be Hayao Miyazaki's final depot in his long career, rather I want to see him leave the ring as a legend instead of a champion.<br/><br/>Rating: ***½"
"jdesando","10","14","22","17 June 2005"," Original and Thoughtful
","Now I know why everyone was excited about Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar winning animation, because his new Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from a British novel by Diana Wynne Jones, is more original and thoughtful than any American entry in that genre. The visuals of flat, classic animation with slow-moving characters and painterly backgrounds are alone worth the experience, the castle itself an imaginative hodgepodge of chicken-legged monsters from Russian folklore and cumbersome war machines from Star Wars. As the director has said, ""I've told the people on my CGI staff not to be accurate, not to be true. We're making a mystery here, so make it mysterious.""<br/><br/>The plot is almost inscrutable as it depicts a kind of late nineteenth-century European city in which hat shop girl Sophie alternately is wooed by a cute wizard, Howl, and cursed by a witch to be shifted into an old crone's body. Her Dorothy-like wandering with, among others, a pogo-sticked scarecrow, takes her to the titular castle of Howl, where she cleans, keeps order, and longs for Howl. Ultimately she confronts a sorceress, Madam Suliman. War ensues but can't defeat the power of love.<br/><br/>The real strength of Howl's Moving Castle is in character diversity and development with a vain, kind, and immature hero; villains morphing into lovable friends and a fire that talks like Billy Crystal and surpasses Eddie Murphy's wisecracking donkey. These are just some of the touches of this hip Asian anime that comments on the folly of war promoted by very neocon-like leaders and the endlessly interesting conflicts between the good and bad angels of each character. Shape-shifting heroine Sophie says, ""I don't want to live if I can't be beautiful!"" Now there's my kind of self-centered lady, heroic and callow in the same film.<br/><br/>No one-dimensional characters for this director, perhaps the most gifted animator in the world."
"pwteatros","2","34","62","28 September 2005"," Form more important than function? Spoiler
","In this movie, form is more important that function. We go from one pointless subplot to the other just so that we can see these wonderful and enchanting images of worlds we have never seen. The movie never comes together because the creators (director, etc) are too busy making sure they create beautiful images and scenarios. I don't see it as a poetic anti war movie. The book may do that, but this movie is not about anything. In the UK version it is not clear why Howl gives his heart to calcifer. It is not clear why Howl, knowing all his problems would be solved by putting his heart back in, doesn't do it --hey, the heart was always there! It is not clear why the witch of the waste wanted Howl's heart. And it is not clear why the Sophie's mother all of the sudden appears in the movie in the place where she used to live. What happened to the hat shop that it was empty for them to move back in. Pointless. I hate it when artists think form is more important than communicating with audiences."
"JTurner82","10","9","13","27 June 2005"," A somewhat lesser yet imaginative fairy tale from Hayao Miyazaki.
","With HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, Hayao Miyazaki takes a popular British children's book by Dianne Wyanna Jones and transforms it into yet another breathtakingly gorgeous and sumptuously animated work of art. Indeed, from the opening shot where we see the title structure--a bizarre amalgam of iron, steam, and unexpected surprises--loom ominously out of the mist, audiences will find themselves on a roller coaster of visual delight and imagination.<br/><br/>The story, set in a 19th century British countryside, involves a young woman named Sophie who is literally swept off her feet by the handsome yet enigmatic wizard, Howl--despite warnings from her fellow friends that this ""lady-killer"" of a magician eats the hearts of young girls alike. Soon after, Sophie finds herself cursed by the jealous Witch of the Waste--where she is transformed into a ninety-year-old crone. Forced to flee from her hometown, ""Grandma"" Sophie (who occasionally reverts from old to young as the film progresses) takes refuge in Howl's fortress, where she makes a pact with a wisecracking fireball known as Calcifer in order to break his own curse, and likewise, her own.<br/><br/>The plot gets a little bit more complicated from here on out, with various side-stories that involve a war, a stern queen who wants Howl to serve in her name, and--wouldn't you know--Howl conquering his inner demons of despair and selfishness through true love. Yet this kind of complex-storytelling has been a well-known trait of Japanese animation, and should be no different here.<br/><br/>Fans of the novel that this film is based on have argued that Miyazaki's movie is a poor interpretation of Jones' story (apparently he changed things from the original to suit his imagination). Not having read the book, I can't comment on what parts of the story have been altered or which remain faithful, but as a genuinely huge fan of Miyazaki's work, I have to say that his adaptation is a charming delight on its own ground. Probably the best way to appreciate this film is to approach it as an inspiration for a masterpiece of animation, and not as an undistorted incarnation of Jones' world.<br/><br/>This is not to say, however, that Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is flawless--far from it. For fans spoiled by his more action-packed classics such as NAUSICAA and CASTLE IN THE SKY, this film offers little in the way of exciting set pieces. The overall story unfolds at a leisurely pace; this worked in favor of his more quieter, gentler children's tales such as MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, and of course the surrealistic SPIRITED AWAY, but here it sometimes comes off as a bit of a detriment. Given the war subplot and a few occasional action-sequences, one would expect HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE to at least have a grand climax. Regrettably, it concludes in a manner that is slower and more drawn-out than SPIRITED AWAY does, undermining its potential for an epic fantasy. I lay this blame, however, on myself; I had unrealistically high expectations for this film, and so I couldn't help but feel a little bit let down by the finale.<br/><br/>Still, in spite of its pacing problems, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE has a lot to offer in the way of visual fiestas, characters that one can identify with, and of course, Joe Hisaishi's richly romantic underscore. This may be a lesser film from Miyazaki, but HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is nonetheless leaps and bounds above the weakest animated features out there and certainly better than the cute but inspired THE CAT RETURNS though not as memorable as his more well-known works. Nonetheless, it earns my highest recommendation; see it on the big screen while you still can, for it's one of the ultimate ways to truly experience this film.<br/><br/>On another matter, I am reluctant to choose a favorite out of the Disney/Miramax-produced English tracks for Miyazaki's movies because I have found every one of them to be of five-star quality and always a pleasure to listen to (even the ones that some folks are somewhat divided about, notably PRINCESS MONONOKE, CASTLE IN THE SKY, and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE). But for the record, Disney once again provides a very capable cast to lend their vocals to the characters and two skillful people to direct them (PIXAR's Pete Docter and Disney's own Rick Dempsey).<br/><br/>As Howl, Christian Bale displays charisma, emotion, and charm; he tends to speak softly, except for when he throws a fit about his hairdo, but this actually works for his character. Emily Mortimer is excellent as the sweet, sincere young Sophie, as is elderly Jean Simmons as her 90-year-old counterpart. This triumvirate is amply supported by the gravel tones of Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Josh Hutcherson as the childlike sorcerer Markl (who can make himself look older than he really is), Blythe Danner as Madam Suliman (an astonishingly minor part for a role that appears to command great presence), and longtime Anime voice-over (and huge Miyazaki fan) Crispin Freeman in a brief cameo at the end. (You can also hear him play various roles in the English version of GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES.) Yet as with all the Disney/Miyazaki dubs, there is always one actor who will steal the spotlight from the others (not that this is a bad thing; I don't mind!), and this time it's the ever-amusing Billy Crystal. As the wily fire-demon Calcifer (who reminded me a lot of Phil Hartman's Jiji from KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE in both sarcasm and tone), Crystal scorches up the scenery and provides all the best moments as well as laughs (hey, he's hot). All told, yet another A+ grade Disney production on a solid little movie from Miyazaki."
"kaisheng","9","9","13","27 February 2005"," Many Parallels with Spirited Away
","I just saw this movie yesterday and I haven't felt this way about an animated movie since ""Spirited Away"" (albeit the latter left me much more in awe than the former, since it was the first of its kind).<br/><br/>This movie had many of Hayao Miyazaki's other movies' trademarks. Lush landscape, endearing characters, haunting soundtrack (courtesy of Joe Hisaishi), great attention to details and all the little quirks, which brings a smile to one's (mine, at least) face.<br/><br/>Its been a while after ""Spirited Away"" was shown, and ""The Cat Returns"" has been rather disappointing, so I was really looking forward to it. And I am glad to say that although I felt that there weren't any breakthroughs in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" (HMC), it was on par with ""Spirited Away"" (SA) and ""Princess Mononoke"" and it was most certainly satisfying.<br/><br/>Spoilers!!!! However, there seemed to be many parallels (coincidence??) between HMC and SA, which seemed kind of bizarre since SA was an original story while HMC was adapted from a book by Diana Wynn Jones (I most certainly will be paying my neigbourhood bookstore for it!).<br/><br/>In HMC, Howl made a deal with Calcifer and it was up to Sophie to find out and help break the enchantment that held them both since they can't tell anyone what it is. On the other hand, Sophie herself was cursed to look like YuBaba (from SA) by the Witch of the Wastes and only Howl could help her, but she could not mention it to anyone else. In the process, she fell in love with Howl. What was revealed to us in the end was that Sophie actually witnessed the event where Howl and Calcifer met and signed the contract with each other, and told Howl to wait for her to help them break the enchantment.<br/><br/>In HMC, there were also many interesting characters, most notable was the Scarecrow named Turnip and the dog (can't remember what its name is).<br/><br/>In SA, Haku made a pact with YuBaba to become her disciple, in the process losing his true name and ended up being her henchman and doing all her dirty job. Chihiro stumbled into the enchanted world and had to become a servant in the land to save her parents through Haku's help. Haku helped her remember her real name. Along the way, Chihiro helped Haku remember his true name and he reveals to her that he once saved her when she was a child drowning in a river. They too fall in love.<br/><br/>In SA, there was the child of YuBaba when he got turned into a fat rat (which has since spawned many soft toys) as well as the crows and the workers which helped Kamaji with the coal.<br/><br/>Similarities aside, I enjoyed both movies. I've been a sucker for stuff like that since I was a child. I thoroughly enjoyed Neil Gaiman's ""Stardust"", which I think Hayao Miyazaki would make a fine adaption as well.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in HMC, Miyazaki explored the idea of war (the 2 countries of the world were involved in a war), making HMC a tad darker than SA, showing the destruction and mayhem brought about by the fighting.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is the best full-length animated feature I have since in 4 years (since SA). It definitely has more heart and soul than any of the Disney and Pixar features. Whilst it is true that ""The Incredibles"" can dazzle one with the CGI and their American-centric wit while Shrek 2 entertained the masses with (by now dated) popular wisecracks, it is the eternal message of hope and love that will transcend time and technology, making HMC and SA timeless milestones."

You can't help but truly feel for the characters. :-) Turnip Head was such a great idea. Oz has nothing on that guy. The castle will blow your mind. The character animation is enthralling, the backgrounds are idyllic. Excellent humanistic storyline! Every writer/director has something to learn from Hayao Miyazaki.

This movie appeals to kids as well as adults. I took my 3 year old daughter to see it and she was completely drawn into it. This movie has an intelligent sense of humor that makes you honestly want to laugh, and not some shallow ""slapstick"" humor. There is plenty of action and drama to be found as well. You will have your emotions going all over the place while watching this. At first I was skeptical about the idea of a ""moving castle"" as the title implies, but once you watch it, things will make sense and you wouldn't want the plot to be any other way.

"Scarlet_Onyx","10","11","17","16 June 2005"," Made me feel like a kid again
","I saw the commercial for the movie a few days before the premiere and it just grabbed me - I had to go see it. Howl's Moving Castle is pure magic.<br/><br/>First, it has an entertaining and charming storyline, but not something that I would consider deep. That's okay though because I didn't go in expecting to find a profound message hidden in there somewhere. There's plenty of humor, including commentary on old age that even my mother chuckled at. Secondly, the animation is amazing. The settings, the people, the vehicles - all are detailed and interesting. I'm told there is 3-D sneaked into it as well and I didn't see anything painfully obvious so bravo on incorporating it successfully.<br/><br/>I said it makes me feel like a kid because it didn't rely on logic. I mean, it has a castle that walks on little stick legs and looks like a pile of junk held together with who-knows-what. But the sheer weirdness of it fit the movie. I didn't once sit there and try to puzzle out how it could move - I accepted its ability to walk. I think we too often expect something as illogical as magic to work by rules.<br/><br/>Not that there weren't things that couldn't be improved upon. The characters were a bit flat: they didn't really develop a great deal as time went on, but again this wasn't a deep movie. Bale's voice for Howl might not have been the best choice as it sounded a bit too deep and forceful for the slender wizard. The rest of the character voices were more or less fine. Jean Simmons did a great job and Billy Crystal's always good with the funny lines. The ending was a bit rushed as if they realized they only had a couple of minutes to wrap things up so a few things happened so quickly that they seemed more like an afterthought.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I was really happy to see it and come out with the feeling that magic still does exist somewhere out there."
"abramzjeremenko","9","6","8","6 September 2018"," Amazing, yet it moves forward to fast.
","I am a big fan of Studio Ghibli, especially this one. I would consider one of my top five. The character are beautifully created, and show many characteristics. For example, one of the main characters, Sophie Hatter portrayed, in my opinion, the idea that even if you're old, feel old, or even no matter how you look, we are all kind, warmhearted, amazing, or even young on the inside. I'd even say that her character shows that we look how we feel. <br/><br/>On one note the story is amazing, beautifully designed, and crafted perfectly, however, I feel as though the whole thing was too fast. As in, I couldn't fully grasp the whole picture. I can see how the fast pace can make the movie more intense and exciting, but it mostly made the movie slightly bad for me.<br/><br/>I do recommend people watch this movie, because almost all of the Studio Ghibli movies are amazing. Some are very depressing like Grave of the Fireflies, but it was still a good movie. So if you want a movie that is has a good plot, character development, and even just camera shots that bring out a the characters, I suggest you watch this."

","I saw this today and went in not knowing quite what to expect. I hadn't seen Spirited Away (though now I am motivated to go and rent it), but I had heard people raving and singing praises for Miyazaki's films. Also, I love manga art and to see a movie done in such an elegant style; made my mind up.<br/><br/>From the moment the film started, I was enthralled. The music was so incredibly captivating, it swept you along with it and the choice of dialogue was just the right blend of serious, moving, heartwarming, and downright comical. I also have not read the original book this was based ""loosely"" on, so I basically went with a very open mind. On the whole, I really cannot fault this movie. In my opinion, it has something for *everyone*. Adults of all ages, teenagers, kids....I have no doubt that everyone can find something to enjoy in this movie and I would honestly be extremely surprised if anyone came out saying ""Wow...I HATED that!"" As I mentioned before, the music is incredible. It flows so beautifully, and the theme tune was been in my head ever since I walked out the cinema. <br/><br/>It was also extremely refreshing to see a film that warms your heart, has no sex scenes or real gore (ie: blood spurting) or swearing and yet still manages to hold its audience in this day and age. *laughs* Just goes to show really. Another thing I really admired was the underlying moral and heartfelt issues throughout. The idea that everyone is beautiful no matter what their physical appearance and also the way the film dealt with the issue of war and the devastation it causes, really made me want to stand up and cheer.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was awesome as Howl. His voice seemed to alternate throughout from confident Howl, to crushed and depressed Howl so easily and with such sophistication. I know it is an actor's job to portray different tones of voice but wow....Christian was beyond excellent. At several points, I really felt for Howl and at others, I felt like melting under the sound of such a velvet like voice. <br/><br/>Personally, this is the best film I have seen for a long long time and I cannot recommend it highly enough."

I've read reviews where folks think that this movie is not as good as the other Studio Ghibli movies (we have almost all of them) and so we were wary. Frankly, this turned out to be such a great date movie! It was truly a love story, and I believe that this was the first of Studio Ghibli's true love stories. At least it seems to be the only one of it's kind in English.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie happens when Howl introduces Sophie to a wildflower swept field, which is Howl's own personal space, and is a memory from his childhood. At that point, my husband and I were completely immersed in the world that Ghibli once again wonderfully and almost magically created. Believe me, when you reach that point in the movie, you will be ""spirited away.""

","Hayao Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is one of the best motion pictures I have seen in 2005. Even better than his last movie, ""Spirited Away"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"" draws the viewer into a world where magic and technology have developed along side each other. While appealing to audiences of all ages, This film is reminiscent the heart and spirit of the early Disney films. <br/><br/>I normally see a movie only once in the theatres, and even fewer do I consider/plan to purchase. I definitely plan on seeing it (again) in the theatre at least one more time, and will be one of the first in line when the DVD is released for sale."
"lippp-1","2","28","53","2 June 2006"," overrated confused mess
","Sometimes reviews assume lives of their own. That seems to be the most plausible reason this film has received so much praise. Yes, it is very visual at times. At other times not so impressive. For example the fire in the castle could have been drawn by a talented fourth grader. But the real elephant in room everyone seems to be overlooking is this film has a very confused, hard to follow plot. In fact the director, Hayao Miyazaki, has as much said he agrees. So why do people sit through a film they really can't make heads or tails of and sing it's praise? Well, probably because you're supposed to. Slapp on the artsy title of animie and Miyazaki's name and you have critics falling over themselves to sing it's praise. I suspect the average movie goer will not be happy with Howl's Moving Castle. When you pay almost $10.00 per ticket you don't really care about credentials, you want to be entertained. And watching visuals just goes so far before you know you've been snookered. Instead, rent ""The Triplets of Belleville"" if you want to see creative animation at it's best."

","This film is fantastic. The voices, visuals, and story are all top notch. Best scene: When Howl starts summoning dark spirits cuz he's depressed. Kids 7 and up will be able to deal with the war aspect, even if they don't get the surreal parts. The story is less a 'war epic' and more a love story. The end is a bit too quick. But its really the journey that counts, no? The kid's disguise cracked me up. Actually there were lots of laughs and lots of wonder. Hilarious, serious, and touching. My girlfriend started crying. The dog and witch being woven into the story seemed kind of rushed. Sophie rocks. Can't wait for the DVD. This one is worth seeing in the theatre."
"jennyhor2004","3","21","39","24 December 2011"," Cynical and manipulative cut-and-paste job of other Miyazaki films with conservative message for girls
","Up to and including ""Spirited Away"", the animated films by Studio Ghibli are of a high standard both technically and in spirit. With ""Howl's Moving Castle"", the soulful quality of the earlier films that peaked with ""Princess Mononoke"" disappears and what we get is an empty shell of a story that exploits typical Studio Ghibli motifs and themes and the studio's technical virtuosity. All the familiar devices of earlier films – a young female protagonist on the verge of adulthood, elderly women, a flawed hero with shamanic characteristics, heroes and villains manipulated by more powerful characters of uncertain quality, sophisticated flying technology in an alternative 19th-century steampunk world – are worked over in a fantasy aimed (cynically it seems to me) at a mainstream Western audience and the result looks very cheesy and manipulative with an ulterior message that superficially celebrates female bravery but channels it into socially restrictive roles.<br/><br/>The story's heroine is a plain-jane working-class hat-maker called Sophie who accidentally meets a young wizard Howl and so arouses the jealousy of the Witch of the Waste who turns her into an old woman. Sophie runs away and meets a scarecrow called Turnip who takes her to Howl's over-sized trailer-park home. Here she meets a fire demon called Calcifer and Howl's child assistant Markl. Sophie insinuates herself into Calcifer, Markl and Howl's lives by claiming to be a cleaning-woman and through her association with the unlikely trio, is drawn into a war between Howl's country and an enemy realm missing its Crown Prince; during the film's course the war also moves into Sophie's country. Howl is forced to participate in this war at the cost of eventually losing his humanity through repeated transformations into a bird creature. Sophie comes to realise that Howl and the Witch of the Waste are pawns of more powerful forces, represented in part by Madame Suliman, the former mentor of Howl, and Sophie's work for the rest of the film is cut out trying to locate Howl's missing heart, the mysterious connection between Howl and Calcifer, ending the war and locating the missing Crown Prince.<br/><br/>Working out all the different strands of the film and connecting them together might take viewers 2 – 3 viewings which would expose them to an excess of saccharine musical schmaltz and a deadly ""love conquers all"" radiation cloud in the tradition of Beauty-and-the-Beast stories. I think if I had to sit through this film again, my hair and teeth will start falling out, my skin will break out into ulcers and bruises will mysteriously appear and spread. Characters are poorly developed and the love Sophie feels for the feckless Howl is so unbelievable as to be laughable; she would have been better off taking her chances with Turnip who performs a noble act of voluntary self-sacrifice in comparison with Howl who fights because he is compelled to, not out of free will.<br/><br/>The war merely forms a backdrop to the events and all the various characters can do is try to stop it without understanding anything about the lead-up to it and why Suliman forces Howl to do her dirty work; or participate in it. Even the animation of the war and its participants looks like a cut-and-paste job of previous Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli films like ""Nausicaa of the Valley of Winds"", ""Porcorosso"", ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" and ""Princess Mononoke"": several flying machines look like those giant bug monsters of ""Nausicaa "" with wing-flaps added as an afterthought. Backgrounds are visually gorgeous at first but turn out to be generic according to the role they have to play so, for example, town scenes have a dreamy alternative-universe quality similar to scenes in ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" which takes place in a similar alternative 1950s universe that might well follow on in the future from ""Howl's Moving Castle"".<br/><br/>The film is too long and its story is too intricate to work as a family film, the characters are shallow and implausible, the animation is cynically overwhelming and unoriginal. Worst of all is the film's message about what happens to girls eventually: they get to play brave heroines for a brief while and once they are adults, they can be either beautiful scheming bitches like Suliman or domestic-goddess workaholics like the geriatric Sophie slaving away for love. Issues like the nature of war – Miyazaki made the movie partly in protest at the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 – are sidelined so much that all the eye- blinking in the world couldn't make them more missed. No way in the world would I recommend this film for families with young daughters. I feel so cheated having seen it."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","4","5","3 April 2010"," Howl's Moving Castle is an imaginative and delightful Miyazaki film
","I love anime, and when I noticed that Howl's Moving Castle was showing today, I knew I had to see it. And you know what, I wasn't disappointed. I admit I haven't read the book by Diana Wynne Jones, but this film is so imaginative and delightful I doubt I would have cared if it was unfaithful to the book or not. The animation here is amazing, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colours so bright. Plus the castle itself was a wonder to behold. The visual style here also has a certain elegance about it, and the atmosphere the visuals create is somewhat meticulous. I also have to mention the score, it was absolutely stunning. Beautiful, magical and poignant themes that caressed my ears, like a Mozart opera would. The characters are engaging and are beautifully voiced by a terrific voice cast. Christian Bale's(not a stranger to voice work, he voiced Thomas in Disney's Pocahontas as well) seductive and silky voice brings vain wizard Howl to vivid life, and Sophie is a very lovable and beautiful character, whether in her younger form or her older form. Her younger form is sensitively voiced by Emily Mortimer and her older self is voiced by the late Jean Simmons with real sincerity. The Witch of the Waste is a character consumed by jealousy, so much so it results in Sophie's transformation from a young 18 year old girl to a pensioner. This character is perfectly voiced by screen legend Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is a joy to behold as Calcifer, one of my favourite characters in the film, and Turniphead was very intriguing as well. The story is a sweet, timeless imaginative one, not the best written one by all means, but it did touch me a lot. Did I notice anything wrong? Yes, but these flaws are minor compared to the overall beauty of the film. The final third is a little too rushed, and the ending is a little over-surreal. But overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enchanting and delightful work from Miyazaki. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"digadigado","9","4","5","15 July 2005"," Outstanding! One of Miyazaki's Best.
","WritelySo's review has said it better than I ever could. So I'll put my two cents worth in anyway.<br/><br/>Of the three big name and one independent feature films I've seen in the past six weeks, this is the best. The first thing that catches your eye (ahem!) is Miyazaki's wonderful animation. His scenes are to film what Hal Foster did to the Sunday comics. They are colorful, lifelike, have great attention to detail and are... well, just beautiful.<br/><br/>A late 19th European setting done to a fare-thee-well by a Japanese artist? You bet. He did it in Porco Rosso and he's done it at least as well here. That's another recommended Miyazaki masterpiece after this one charms you.<br/><br/>I was quickly caught up in the film. The characters are believable and the voices, well it's a shame to call it dubbing. I doubt it was easy to match English dialog to a Japanese film but they did a superb job. What this means to you is that you never, ever notice. The voices are appropriate to the characters and, I think, really enrich the character's personalities.<br/><br/>While kids will appreciate the animation and action, Howl's Moving Castle is really for adults. Take your kids to see it. When they see it again in ten years, they'll see an entirely new film all over again.<br/><br/>If there's any justice in the Academy Awards, this should get Miyazaki another one - I think it's even better than Spirited Away.<br/><br/>When they're worth it (rarely) I pay attention to film scores, and Joe Hisaishi has written one well matched to this fine film.<br/><br/>Did I make the point that I LOVED this film? I hope you do too."

Well, it's just great how they ended up together in the end! All the other ones, they never ended up together. It was usually impossible love or something, but this one was different. Just because it was all happy and they were together until the end was the sweetest thing! I really didn't find anything wrong with the movie though...I thought it was fine, and I think it deserved getting the 3 and 1/2 stars...although I would've like 4 stars better, but oh well.

","I went to Howl's Moving Castle having been a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and was impressed. It was on par with his other movies, which are all equally great. The animation was stunning and the musical score was fantastic. Billy Crystal as the voice of the fire demon Calcifer annoyed me slightly, but other then that the the voices were great. The story could be confusing at times but was still good. The only really bad part for me was that the ending was sort of stupid. Other then that the movie was great, and had great animation. Howl's moving Castle is a good movie even compared to Miyazaki's other films such as Naussica and Spirited Away."
"thinker1691","8","5","7","3 May 2007"," Fire, Magic and a boy's heart
","From the Island of Japan comes this incredible story of an enchanted and magical castle. A young girl, named Sophi is bewitched and accidentally encapsulated into a traveling fortress. Unaware her brief meeting with a handsome and powerful wizard prince, will enrage the Witch of the Waste, Sophie is thus drawn into the struggle to find a lasting peace to a ongoing war. The story is interesting to be sure, but the animation and picturesque scenery add more than enough action and drama to offset traditional venues. Within the film are the talented voices of Jean Simmons and Emily Mortimer as the voice of Sophie, Christian Bale as Howl, the Bird Prince, Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman, the Sourceress. Josh Hutcherson as Markl and of course Billy Crystal is terrific as Calcifer, the Fire Demon. This fine cast adds resilience to the inspirational tale as does the colorful and touching film. To anyone who enjoys children's stories which endure the test of time and mesmerize modern audiences, this is one for the complete library. A classic in the making. ****"
"danielarreba","9","5","7","2 March 2006"," An amazing animated film
","Hauru no ugoku shiro is one of the most amazing animated films that I've seen in a long time. Alredy tired of Disney/Pixar paraphernalia, Hayao Miyazaki's film is fresh air in our mouth. And a sparkling scratch in our eyes. Definitely Miyazaki is a creator who has chosen animated films as the best way to express his ideas. Sophie is a young lady living a bored life in some place in Europe (not defined), at the beginning of XX century (not defined either). War times, and this is an important issue in the meaning of the film. Miyazaki is a pacifist and this movie can prove it. Howl, the young-beautiful man blessed (or punished, it all depends how you look at him)with magic powers, is a struggler who fights at nights breaking down anachronic war ships . Even more, he refused kingdom call which pretends he fights in the front. Sophie will be victim of the trick made by an evil witch (later we will find out that the same witch has been cheated)becoming in an 90 years old woman. Without hope, she'll rove until to find a fantastic roding castle with strange people living in it. The movie takes an oniric twist, in which logic is suspended, plot back and forth following undetermined parameters, as the castle does it.Hauru no ugoku shiro is a powerful visually film, which is not afraid to play with fantasy. It's a political film too."
"BriarRos","9","5","7","21 June 2005"," Totally Engrossing: If you liked Sprited Away, you'll love this!
","I drove for three hours to reach a theater that was playing this film, and it was worth it! The English cast was amazing, and I normally shun all dubbed films. It really seemed like they were the original voices. I never once wished I could hear the Japanese like I usually do, even on Spirited Away. Now that is settled!<br/><br/>This film deals mostly with the character of Sophie. I won't sum up the plot, you've seen that already. The heart of the film is at Sophie accepting herself, and accepting the affection of other people. That's pretty much the moral. The most winning character by far is Howl himself, at least for a girl like me. He is a really complex character, beautiful drawn, and voiced with precision by Christian Bale. He sounds really similar to his Batman voice in this, so get ready for that. Billy Crystal's Calcifer is refreshingly muted. I had worried about him being too flamboyant, but he is really a charming character. The entire cast of characters are so real, as is the world they inhabit, that it just draws you in. I smiled through the first half of the movie! <br/><br/>I saw the film with friends in their mid-twenties, one of which is not into anime, and we all enjoyed it. Many of the folks at the theatre brought children, but it seemed like the adults enjoyed it far more than the children. It is probably too dark for kids under 8, in my opinion. There is a lot of bombing in the second half, and it can be startling. <br/><br/>I all this is a really good film. The plot gets a little complicated in the second half, where it starts to greatly deviate from the book and become more Miyazaki, but there is plenty of action, comedy, romance, and fun to please every age group. I plan on taking my grandma to see it; I think older people would really get a kick out of ""Grandma Sophie."" Best Animated Film of the year, for sure!"
"dballred","8","18","35","2 December 2004"," Enjoyable but Unimaginative
","First of all, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of this film and intend to see it several more times. On a technical level, Miyazaki has elevated the traditional 2-D animated film above the cheesier but more realistic 3-D Computer-generated works that seem to prevail everywhere else. Whether he used computers to simulate the 2-D look is beyond my current knowledge, but I applaud his attempt to abandon the technique that even crept into his previous work, _Spirited Away_.<br/><br/>The film is *very* loosely based on the original novel. In fact, only the basic premise and the main characters seem to have survived Miyazaki's scalpel. As a story, it is unimaginative and trite. Furthermore, the characters lacked depth. Unlike he did with _Kiki's Delivery Service_, Miyazaki failed to improve upon the original work. <br/><br/>All is forgiven, though. This is one-hundred percent pure uncut Miyazaki. I was left with the impression that he was going to have fun with a project, this was the project, and he had a great deal of fun with it. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided excellent musical support. I gave this film an 8."
"MartinHafer","8","6","9","11 June 2007"," Great provided you are not a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan or watch the film with one!
","I went to see this film with my anime and Diana Wynne Jones-loving teenage daughter. And while I enjoyed the film immensely due to its excellent animation, story and overall sense of fun, it was also interesting to see how much my daughter hated it! It was as if we saw two entirely different films. Why? Well, she is a huge Diana Wynne Jones fan and has read and re-read just about everything she ever wrote. And, according to her, the story was so different and so inferior to the book that she disliked the film and said some very nasty things about director Miyazaki. However, my advice is DON'T read the book and just go and see the movie. Then, after enjoying it, read the book ONLY if you are 100% sure you can do this without freaking out because they are so different!! I didn't know the difference and had a great time seeing the film!"
"zephyr24-1","8","6","9","5 March 2005"," Whimiscal wizardry and war drama
","After the Oscar-winning Sprited Away by Hayou Miyazaki, the skates are high for his next animated feature. His adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones' 2001 book Howl's Moving Castle is no doubt an unrivaled animated feature featuring sorcery and wizards against the backdrop of war and a sweet romance.<br/><br/>While the animation is lively and the effects are stunning, the whimsical adaptation suffered from too much layering of plot. There may be occasions where one may be lost in the plot. Though this definitely does not affect my enjoyment of the movie, I thought it would have benefited from better continuity. I have not read the original book but it's surely not an easy task to bring a book to life through the painstaking process of animating every single frame."
"cinephiliac","4","19","38","1 October 2005"," Not upto his own standards.
","'Incredibly disappointing' would be a short (if not sweet) summary. Or maybe just 'average', which is the worst thing you could possibly say about a film from a director who had previously sought to delight through imagination and vibrancy.<br/><br/>In Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki struggles to find original ground and ends up retreading now increasingly familiar ideas and motifs from his previous work, even the opening title sequence seems to reuse music from his breakout hit Spirited Away. We have a teenage girl (Sophie, the protagonist), a silent and ineffective partner (Turnip-head), a humorous sidekick (Calcifer), a collection of wishy-washy tag-alongs (Markl & co), vague enemies which are totally unexplored, and a mysterious and largely undeveloped male teenager, who here happens to be the titular Howl. All characters also suffer from abysmal phoned-in performances for the English dub (I can't comment on the original), in particular Christian Bale (Howl) who barely varies his delivery throughout, and Emily Mortimer (Sophie) who gives an appallingly flat performance for the lead. Only the ever-reliable Billy Crystal gives value for money as the fire daemon Calcifer, though it's nothing incredibly special - more accurately simply a cut-price Robin Williams.<br/><br/>Elsewhere there are more significant problems. The story is a mess both in terms of plotting and pacing and scripting. It begins well enough but falls into predictable buddy-buddy routines all too early, fails to head in any clear direction for a long time and then ends on a half-hearted note (which is to say ridiculously hokey) with a total non-conclusion. Whole ideas are thrown into the mix and left unexplained, like the war which is at the center of the action, the king (queen?), the other wizards. Miyazaki could arguably be even trying to say something about the Iraq war, with a myriad of none too subtle contemporary references, but even that didactic aspect is lost.<br/><br/>You will likely not leave the cinema satisfied, unless you are ten years old - and even the kids behind me were bored to tears long before the finishing line. A rethink is needed over at Ghibli studios..<br/><br/>4/10."
"AhmedSpielberg99","7","2","2","26 July 2019"," Look for what's underneath!
","This is the only Miyazaki film I've seen so far that's what's on its surface is way, way less impressive than what's underneath it. Neither its fantastical story, its visual splendor, nor its understated yet funny humour hold a candle to its subtext. Howl's Moving Castle's weight lies on What's beyond its story. It's actually a meditation on age and love. Miyazaki allows you here to see the world through the eyes of an adult who longs to be young again while conveying a plethora of lessons by his visual storytelling, which is here at its finest regarding practicality, but this is not the case regarding creativity.<br/><br/>The film also has tons of pacing issues, most noticeably in the first hurried 15 minutes and the rushed denouement. It also never fully settles into its storytelling technique. I wouldn't have minded the self-indulgent dreamy-like narration (well, not so much), nor this of the your typical sweet fairly tale one. But the mix of both made everything feels quite messy instead of flowing like a hallucinatory dream or an intriguing fantastical adventure story.<br/><br/>Indeed, these issues had me confused a little bit. But the unprecedented practical visual storytelling I've mentioned above undeniably compensates for that. As the film proceeds, I find myself understand almost every obscure detail without being explained. That's mostly, if not entirely, due to Miyazaki's unmatched ability to tell a story relying on visual symbolism that remarkably keeps paying off till the last second.<br/><br/>Overall, Howl's Moving Castle is the least Hayao Miyazaki film I've enjoyed so far. But that should by no means indicate that it isn't an exceptional work that's as light-hearted and delightful as it's though-provoking and heartwarming.<br/><br/>(7.5/10)"

It had the same names of some of the characters and places - is about the ONLY resemblance to the book. The rest, its completely different. The characters have no real motivation for their actions, other than that its what the script told them. The continuity is *terrible* (I don't mean Sophie morphing randomly between old and young, I understand that, I mean, how come howl can fly at the start and at the end he can only fly when some weird bird thing). It loses the whole part of howl being cursed by the witch, you never know WHY calcifer makes his deal with howl, WHY the scarecrow is following Sophie, and what IS it with all the huge war vehicles with massive guns? This isn't dominion tank police - but you'd be forgiven for thinking it was.

The music used is really good. You'll find the film touching all ages, perhaps some children may not understand the story fully, but ages 12 and above, its a recommended Film. I heard that it will release in USA around June 2004, in Japan it has already been released, France I believed has already been released.<br/><br/>Howl's moving Castle is an emotional story, in which it revolves around Wizard howl and witch in the wasteland, as well as Sophie. The setting is placed mostly on the moving castle which is magically powered by calucifer (a cute evil spirit fire), and basically Howl had captured this spirit from a shooting star as u'll see in the movie. I wont say much, but its a must-see anime film."

","I had the good fortune to see HMC in a theater. HMC and Sen to Chihiro are almost exactly equal in my opinion, although I do think that the ending was a bit rushed. Nonetheless, I couldn't stop smiling until my brother came to pick us up. I especially like Christian Bale's voice as Howl, and his entrance was one of the best I've ever seen. The anime club at school agreed with my suggestion to watch it.<br/><br/>It was incredibly refreshing to find out that the American adaption of Howl's Moving Castle did NOT rely on a boatload of famous actors to draw in an audience; as voice-acting is completely different from on-screen acting, casting celebrities in a Miyazaki film (most notably with Mononoke-Hime) is a mistake that will eventually detract from the impact of the movie. However, in Howl, the lack of easily-recognizable voices is both obvious and rather relieving, as I was more able to enjoy the movie without having to dwell upon any lackluster voice-acting, as I did with Princess Mononoke.<br/><br/>EDIT: Since writing this comment, I have read Diana Wynne Jones' novel. There are quite a few differences, such as the scarecrow's relationship to Sophie, Howl's degree of self-centeredness, and an obvious mistake in translation for Markl/Michael's name.<br/><br/>But in spite of the differences, Howl's Moving Castle is an incredible movie with an acceptable to enjoyable cast, fantastic art that is expected of Miyazaki, and a film that both adults and children alike will be able to enjoy."
"hushicho","1","31","75","15 August 2005"," Surprising Disappointment from Uncommonly Incompetent Miyazaki
","For the first time I have seen a Miyazaki film I actively dislike.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is one of the worst films I have ever seen, period, Miyazaki or otherwise. My reservations about it were totally founded, since Miyazaki does best when he doesn't do overt 'romance' (but then the 'romance' in this was a total joke) and does his own work. The novel upon which the film is based is an annoying clump of nonsense spouted by someone whose writing style is apparently to be as irritating as possible.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's version, which takes some liberties with the source material, is just as sickeningly bad. Visually beautiful, it's incoherent plotwise and has some of the worst acting ever appearing in his films...thanks for casting the talentless Takuya Kimura (boy band singer) as the lead. His lacking, cardboard delivery was as weak as any English dub could be. The 'love' is forced and stupid, between two lame-duck characters who have about as much chemistry as a piece of lettuce and a cork. The ending is a shambles and cheapens the entire previous film, and the forced inclusion of an anti-war message actually manages to be insulting to those of us who are anti-war; it's embarrassing to watch it be handled in such an incongruous and outright embarrassing way in this film.<br/><br/>The stupid, unsympathetic heroine for no real reason gets a curse put on her and stumbles into the realm of the vapid hero (if you can call him that; casting in-type for Takuya Kimura though), and boring hijinks ensue. There's no real reason for anything happening in the film, and you aren't moved to really care about the conflict between these countries, nothing of which is expanded upon in the excuse for a 'story'. Some things happen, people are introduced and subsequently forgotten about, and nobody any impact on the screen; perhaps it's because these were never Miyazaki's characters. They have no strength like his usually do. Their designs are utterly uninspired. Then in the last four minutes, everything gets tied up in the most unconvincing, stupid way that makes you feel like you just wasted two hours of your life waiting for it to happen. It's not made to be an experience like Totoro, it's supposed to be a direct sort of story...but it takes forever.<br/><br/>Miyazaki could've...and should've...taken a few pages from his own book and drawn us into a conflict as in Nausicaa...a film where we could actually understand what was happening and actually care about the outcome, and why these people were fighting. Nausicaa, in the film, was a strong and sympathetic heroine entirely resolved in her convictions. Howl's heroine has little real conviction except what other people persuade her to have. She doesn't suit Miyazaki's usual style of youthful yet strong heroines. She was just some stupid girl on the screen, nothing more.<br/><br/>Similarly, Howl was just a vain, inept 'wizard'. He wasn't sympathetic or likable, cute or endearing, he was just stupid and narcissistic and had no real redeeming qualities. Were we supposed to imagine he fell in love with Sophie or whatever her name was? Uh huh...what with all their powerful scenes together and such...if they had a single scene together that ever indicated anything even approaching so much as friendship until the last five seconds of the film, I missed it. The two had no chemistry and acted as two strangers who happened to be in the same general vicinity. Yet another stupid anime standard, the two characters who 'fall in love' because they just happen to be of the opposite gender and spend some time together in the same general area. Because, you know, nobody ever can spend time together with the opposite gender without falling in love, especially during a stressful period of conflict! For once, the supporting characters were just as vapid. There was not a single likable character in this film, nor did anyone stick in my memory as much as any other Miyazaki film. No bizarre and strange No-Face. No knight errant of Nausicaa. No gentle father of Totoro. There was no one even remotely distinct. It was irredeemable. And that is a shame, because something to which Miyazaki gives such effort should not be. It should be better, by its nature, than anything else put out at the time. Howl's deserves to be forgotten, and quickly. It's really pretty shameful that Miyazaki, in his zeal to make an anti-war statement, chose such a sloppy vehicle to tack it onto, and in such an indelicate way. Where is the subtlety we saw in his other movies, the beautiful message we could take to heart and understand, and love? Compared to a masterpiece like Nausicaa, Howl's Moving Castle looks like any other stereotypical shoddy anime joke. But it's not just a joke, it's a tragedy since it should have been good.<br/><br/>I hope the low opinion of viewers both in Japan and abroad of this film will encourage Miyazaki, if he opts to make another film, to use his own story. Maybe next time, if he wants to make a statement, he can take his time and do something decent instead of embarrassing.<br/><br/>I looked to Miyazaki's films to be different from most anime output, to be a refreshing and unique outlet for beauty, hope, optimism, strength, and lovely morals that are subtly communicated. This film was a joke by comparison. It stumbled through its clumsy storytelling from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet...don't! It's awful, and if you've seen any other of Miyazaki's work it will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth. If you haven't seen any of his work, after seeing this you won't want to.<br/><br/>We should never have to say 'I found your movie terrible'. He's better than that, or used to be anyway. I hope perhaps he will put out something decent before he retires as he's discussed many times."
"Kiarie","10","5","8","2 September 2005"," This -needs- an Oscar!
","Wow. This is THE most amazing movie I have -ever- seen, I repeat, -EVER-, and not just in a range of Miyazaki and anime movies, though Howl's Moving Castle has given me whiplash when bypassing Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke by a mile long-shot. This is the story of a young hatter named Sophie (Zofi) who is the oldest of two (three in the book) daughters and believes the fairytale rule of the-first-is-always-the-worst. On her way to visiting her sister Lettie she bumps into two drunken soldiers who flirt shamelessly. She is saved by a handsome young man, who takes her on a ""stroll through the sky"" while escaping from ""ravenous globs of black goo"". When she returns home she meets an obese, ugly lady-later known to be the Witch of the Waste-who curses her into turning into a 90-year-old-woman. The next morning Sophie leaves her home, attempting to get as far from the town as possible. And she ends up in the house belonging to said handsome young man: Howl (Hauru). If I say any more, you would be spoiled. I have seen this movie 5 times in theatres and plan to buy the DVD, rumored to be coming out in November. If you don't see this movie and are yet an anime/manga/Miyazaki fan, it would be a loss that might cause the end of the world. At least in -my- opinion."
"sach96","10","5","8","11 June 2005"," Loved it!
","I saw the movie in Japanese and loved it. I liked the visuals and the story. I bought the book after seeing it and - I might be in the minority here - I didn't like it as much as the movie. While not bad at all I couldn't relate to any of the characters of the book, I found Sophie annoying and closed-minded and Howl's character was quite one dimensional imo. I prefer the movie which I think does a wonderful job in taking some of the original ideas of the book and creating a new and wonderful story even if it doesn't follow the book. I also think the characters in the movie are much more likable. I would still recommend seeing/reading both the move and the book."
"0carina","6","8","15","21 February 2005"," Nice picture, weak storyline
","OK here's another Miyazaki's film. As always, its graphics are nice, and its feel is dream-like. I admire Miyazaki's imagination a lot (I haven't read the original novel of this movie).<br/><br/>However, the movie doesn't impress me a lot because of several reasons:<br/><br/>***spoilers ahead*** <br/><br/>1, You can always see something familiar from it. Well maybe it's Miyazaki or Gibli's trademark, but when I see characters flying, war, a request to stop the war, etc. etc., I begin to feel a bit disappointed. I'm not saying that Howl's not creative enough, but I was expecting something more creative and original, like Spirited Away.<br/><br/>2, Some ideas are quite vague. For instance, why Howl is always flying around the dangerous war scene, while doing nothing at all but getting tired and hurt? Maybe I'm slow, but I didn't see a point for him doing so. Another example, why that return-to-the-past door suddenly appears in front of Sophie? What's its function besides letting Sophie know Howl's past? To me, this part is not really necessary. Even it's a imaginary world, it still need some logic right?<br/><br/>3, The ending is quite predictable. Well, happy ending. But I can't figure out why the war suddenly ends. They fight so hard, for so long time, the Queen even sends out fluid strange people to gather soldiers, and all of sudden, she agrees to stop the war? It doesn't make a clear sense to me. And the cursed-prince-return-to-human-form part looks a bit stupid and abrupt. I'm not saying the ending is disappointing 'cos it's still a good and happy ending, the story deserves it, but...oh well.<br/><br/>***Spoilers End*** <br/><br/>So, yeah that's roughly about it. I still appreciate all the work and effort, and the movie itself is really nice.<br/><br/>6/10, for the nice wonderful word Miyazaki delivers."
"aamy-83183","4","3","4","12 April 2020"," Just a pretty face
","This movie falls short in what should be the main reason to make a movie: it has no coherent story whatsoever. There's zero character development and they start to care for each other for no reason.
They adapted the original story to be a critique on war, but they failed even on that. Howl fights against a few warships and then what? That's a superficial strategy to fight war, just as superficial as the whole movie. In the end, the war is over as if it where a mere whim of the king's magician!
The only parts of the movie that actually get to your heart are the ones that they got from the book. Such a waste of plots.
The aesthetic is beautiful, but they should put more effort on the character's facial expressions and the script, because a pretty movie with no plot is just a waste of time and money."

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","4","9 May 2013"," Howl if you like Howl's Moving Castle!! WOOOOO!!!
","I like the movie, but the film is way too different than the book to the point that it was a bit annoying. They change too many things. The story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. It's like taking 1939's Wizard of Oz and turning it into turning it into Sci-Fi's Tin Man (2007). It's a re-imagining of Dianne Wynne Jones's classic novel. Don't get me wrong, I love Hayao Miyazaki's vision of the book, Howl's Moving castle; I just wish it would had stay more true to Diana Wynne Jones's novel. This movie marks the first time Miyazaki has adapted another writer's work since Kiki's Delivery Service (1989). It is a really fascinating work with lively characters and incredible imagination through out the film. Sophie (Emily Mortimer/Chieko Baisho), a 19-year-old hat maker who is taking away by the charm of a Wizard name Howl (Takuya Kimura/ Christian Bale) when she was rescue by him when she was trying to visit her sister. For punishment for trying to steal her favorite's wizard's heart, The Witch of the Waste (Akihiro Miwa/ Lauren Bacall) transforms her into a 90-year-old woman. In her old, Sophie (Jean Simmons) must searches for a way to break the Witch's spell. On the way, she makes some new friends: Markl (Ryunosuke Kamiki/Josh Hutcherson), Howl's young apprentice, a scarecrow nickname Turliphead, and last Calcifer (Tatsuya Gashun/ Billy Crystal). The visuals in the movie are amazing. It's a steam punk fan's favorite, the way, Miyazaki use CG to creates a ramshackle structure that looks like it might disintegrate at any moment, but held together by the burning heart of magic is interesting. The film is overflows with eclipsing visuals that range from frightening aerial battles to serene landscapes, and interesting details of everything around. There is also the major themes that Miyazaki's works been known for such as such as environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, and the absence of villains. Miyazaki's Howl has a very strong female protagonist that go against gender roles common in Japanese animation and fiction. Both old and young Sophie were very interesting. I love Jean Simmon's voice as old Sophie. She gives some charm and funny moments. I love the stairs scene. I was laughing my head off. The dubbing by English actors match pretty damn good. Good job, Pixar. I love the English dub more than the Japanese since it's based on a English novel. The Japanese just looks a bit odd with the European themes in this film. The plot in the film is secondary, as it's nearly makes no sense and full of plot-holes. Things are mention at the last moment or not fully disclosure toward the end. There is nothing about Wales, no reference, no mention, no allusion to the place where the novel came from. The fate of a lost prince sub-plot comes nowhere in left field toward the end. Miyazaki turned the the story into a protest against the war in Iraq. I have nothing against anti-war propaganda, believe me, but let's call it what it is, and not try to trick people into pulling out cash from their pockets for what they assume is a film version of one of their favorite books. The story is utterly unrecognizable from the original. Several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. Sophie doesn't have her sorceress powers that allow her to turn things into living objects. While the Witch of the Waste is the villain in the book; the movie instead made her, into a weak, harmless woman. Then it made the male Suliman (Haruko Kato/ Blythe Danner) a alley in the novel into a female enemy in the film. Still, there are some changes I do like. I like Howl portrayed as a deep troubled hero rather than the arrogant self-centered wizard he is in the book. Still there is a bit of that self-centered narcissism attitude in him in the film. Reminds me a lot of the story Beauty and the Beast. I like how Calcifer is a cute cheeky little orange flame instead of an evil menacing fire demon. Overall: You have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him. If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear."
"elfflame","9","3","4","23 June 2007"," One of Ghibli's best!
","Went to see this with my husband, and absolutely loved it. I like it much more than Sprited Away, and that says a lot right there, because I loved Spirited Away quite a bit. We bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. <br/><br/>The voices in this were lovely, and Billy was especially wonderful. I'd forgotten that Christian Bale did Howl's voice until the credits, though. <br/><br/>The plot's not perfect, but what's there is excellent. I was a little worried about this, because one of the bad reviews I saw on Rotten Tomatoes (and there weren't many...) said that the writing sucked. Though there are plot holes, the story moves along fast enough that you don't really notice them until you think back on the movie. And there's so much else to focus on that the holes aren't really a major issue. The movie is humorous and solemn in turns, and there's so much to see that the plot holes just don't matter.<br/><br/>As far as characters, I fell immediately in love with Howl, who's very devil-may-care, but with a good heart. There's a great mix of other characters, from the main character, Sophie, who is cursed by a powerful witch because she's caught Howl's attention; to Calcipher, voiced by Billy Crystal, who is the main source of Howl's power. The characters feel like they have back-stories, even though we never learn most of them, and that's fine, given the limitations of a movie of this type. In fact, it makes me more inclined to like the film, as it makes the characters feel more like real people. Yes, I want to know more about them, but it's not necessary to know, and just knowing that there is a history there is enough.<br/><br/>The world is wonderfully rich--kind of a mix of natural magic and the Great War period, with flying ships of all descriptions, odd tanks and battleships, and fascinating mythology, which, while not given much detail, still feels a part of the world, rather than something overlaying it. The Castle itself is not so much a castle as an amazing moving house, which has its own inherent magics, thanks to a fire demon. There were a lot of things that went unexplained, but given the time they had to explain, they did exceptionally well.<br/><br/>That's really all I have to say, aside from the fact that anyone who enjoys Ghibli films should not miss this one."
"kevin86","10","3","4","8 March 2006"," A profound and exhilarating Miyazaki creation!
","Howl's Moving Castle is phenomenal. Presenting itself initially in an odd way, our protagonist Sophie seems somewhat dry and dull. But this lasts only a few moments until a series of fantastical characters pour into her world. Each of these characters, whether it be Calcifer, Markl, Turniphead, the Witch of the Waste (during the last half) or the quiet dog are immediately likable from the get go. You genuinely care about them and their constant references to one another as a family only make the group seem all the more close. It's not very often I'm immediately pulled in by a group of characters but the colorful cast of Howl's Moving Castle are quick to bore a place in memory.<br/><br/>The animation quality is also superb. Vibrant colors and visuals fill every frame and a great attention to detail is thoroughly evident from beginning to end. Though at times it may seem very basic in style, take a second look as every frame holds something distinctively unique and profound in its beautiful fashion. Howl's dazzling transformations are superbly animated throughout his personal endeavors of self-loathing, missing love, and thirst for power. Wheteher he be taking the form of an enormous blue bird or enshrouding himself in the company of dark spirits during a bout of depression, Howl is a spectacle all on his own. The castle he inhabits along with his family is also a treat to the senses. Other than the obviousness of how distinctively creative and complex the outermost appearance of the moving castle is; the magical functions it performs are just as remarkable and interesting. This magnificent creation serves not only as a haven to our heroes but also as a portal to both time and space. It is a mystical labyrinth filled with humorous and surprising secrets and feats at every turn.<br/><br/>The film has a lot to say on love, life, loyalty, war, bravery, and family. And it succeeds gracefully in bringing all these themes together in a very thoughtful and stirring manner. By the films end there is a lot left lingering with you. I found myself thinking about the film as a whole long into the credits' enchanting music. The overall brilliance of its unfolding story, captivating characters, moving relationships, strong themes, elegant visual beauty, and thrilling conflicts is more than I've experienced in a long time in terms of animated films. Yes his last too works Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke were also brilliantly captivating, but Howl's Moving Castle just stood out to me as something extra special in Miyazaki's body of work with Studio Ghibli.<br/><br/>I have seen all of Miyazaki's films with the exception of Kiki's Delivery Service and must say that Howl's Moving Castle is one of Miyazaki's most impressive accomplishes to date. The Academy Award for Best Animated Picture was robbed from this delightful and exciting adventure. I'd have to say that Howl's Moving Castle is my second favorite Miyazaki film, surpassed only by Nausicaa of The Valley of th Wind. Like Nausicaa, this film was grossly overlooked by both general viewers and critics alike. Heres hoping that the DVD release garners more great rating from viewers on this deserving gem."
"jlevy-11","10","3","4","22 June 2005"," Amazing!
","When I saw that Miyazaki had come out with another film in the US I was so excited. Getting to see his works feels like an honor because every movie he has made is a work of art. He makes his imagination come alive. Howl's Moving Castle is the first of his movies that I have seen in theaters and I felt like I wasn't even in a theater. Getting to experience one of Hayao Miyazaki's films on the big screen was just amazing. I love animation and I love seeing other worlds come to life. If you have an active imagination and love animation as much as I do, this is a movie that you have to see(I am avoiding saying anything about the movie so that you can fully experience it for yourself). This is the first movie I have seen that I didn't want to end because it was that wonderful."
"janos451","10","3","4","27 May 2005"," A unique masterpiece
","Dislocation is rarely a pleasant experience, but when the title object of ""Howl's Moving Castle"" first comes into view, its visual, historical, stylistic ambiguity is downright thrilling.<br/><br/>Master animator Hayao Miyazaki (of ""Spirited Away"" and ""Princess Mononoke"") once again takes the breath away with his bizarre imagination and richly painted scenes. The enormous lumbering Gothic/sci-fi structure looming over the late-19th century Alsatian (!) cityscape reminds one of Hieronymus Bosch, of Pieter Breughel, of Friedensreich Hundertwasser, and yet remains resolutely unique - it is Miyazaki, and no one else.<br/><br/>Neither a Hollywood computer-animated film nor a typical Japanese anime, Miyazaki's work is a phenomenon onto itself.<br/><br/>As a movie, ""Castle"" (""Hauru no ugoku shiro""), at 2 hours' running time, is about a half an hour too long. As a work of art, a visual sensation, it's over much too quickly, although it is guaranteed to continue to run in one's mind.<br/><br/>Adopting British author Diana Wynne Jones novel, Miyazaki tells the story of Howl, a terrifying and yet insecure wizard/demon; young milliner Sophie, who is turned into a 90-year-old woman by the Witch of the Waste; Calcifer, a fiery little demon, who powers the castle; Markl, Howl's young apprentice; and the mystical Madame Suliman.<br/><br/>Heaven forfend that such a work be dubbed (""Spirited Away"" was different - and superior - in the subtitled version), but Miyazaki admirers John Lassater and Pete Docter of Pixar have put heart and soul into the English version, and they succeeded. The voice talent for ""Castle"" is extraordinary: Jean Simmons is old Sophie (the film's main character), Emily Mortimer is the pre-curse Sophie, Laren Bacall makes the evil witch almost lovable, Billy Crystal is Calcifer (not overdoing it), and Christian Bale is Howl.<br/><br/>For ""Spirited Away"" fans, ""Castle"" is a must; for those unfamiliar with Miyazaki, this is a splendid introduction to the work of a creative genius."
"Thunderbuck","9","4","6","15 July 2007"," A marvelous, charming world
","Miyazaki builds these wonderful little universes. Poetic, charming places that are at once familiar and exotic. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely bit of film that provides a great little escape.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is clearly a master storyteller, because it's only after viewing this film that I realized there isn't really much ""story"" here, and what there is has many inconsistencies and unexplained twists. The ending, in particular, seems to just ""happen"". But, frankly, the characters are so involving, and the movie is so beautifully drawn, that any story shortcomings are easy to overlook.<br/><br/>I know some are wary of the ""Disneyfication"" of films like this or SPIRITED AWAY. I think this is something of a labor of love, though, and is motivated less by greed than a sincere desire to bring these beautiful films to a wider audience. Certainly the talent isn't lacking in this English language translation, with great vocals from Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and the incomparable Lauren Bacall. Billy Crystal is quite funny as Calcifer, the fire demon, too.<br/><br/>While I think I preferred SPIRITED AWAY on the whole, it's really just a few minor quibbles that lead me to this. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a lovely place to visit for a couple of hours."

","What do you get when you combine the master Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki (""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Spirited Away"") with the British sci-fi novelist Diana Wynne Jones? The answer is ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" an enchanting (if not altogether understandable) animated feature, filled with beauty, imagination and magic.<br/><br/>Sophie is a shy young girl, working in her family's hat shop, who falls under the spell of a witch who turns her into a decrepit old woman. At a loss as to what to do, Sophie decides to leave home and try to find a cure for her condition in the mysterious land of wizards and witches that lies just outside her city. Not long after she arrives, she encounters the mysterious ""moving castle,"" owned by the enigmatic wizard known as Howl, that not only roams freely around the countryside but seems to exist in any number of different dimensions at the same time. It's when she passes through the castle door and discovers what awaits her inside that the really surreal adventure begins.<br/><br/>There's little point in trying to figure out all the fine details of the story, which often feels as if it is being made up as it goes along - and not always in a way that is completely satisfying to those of us who are trying desperately to understand it. Yet, there is a certain fascination in the way the film chooses to defy all the rules of time and space and feels no real compunction to explain how all of it is supposed to work. The movie asks us to merely accept what we are seeing at face value and to go along wherever it is it wants to take us. This is an easy thing to do, primarily because the film's incredible beauty seduces us into accepting the slightly weird alternate reality the movie has set up for us. Although the animators are all Japanese, the characters themselves are Occidental and the film appears to be set sometime in the late Victorian or early Edwardian era of a century ago. The visuals are so exquisite in every detail that it is virtually impossible for us to turn our eyes from the screen even for a split second. Like the best animated films, it transports us to a world that is both utterly fantastic and strangely familiar at the same time.<br/><br/>In bringing the characters to life, the English-language version employs an impressive cast of voices, including veterans Jean Simmons, Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner, along with Billy Crystal, Emily Mortimer and Christian Bale.<br/><br/>With its occasionally incoherent storyline and deliberate pacing, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" may disappoint and frustrate those accustomed to the more simple, hectic and frenetic animated films churned out regularly by Hollywood. But if you're in the mood for a calmer, more relaxing trip to a world not your own, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" provides just the right vehicle to take you there."

Not long, she is living & working with them but also getting involved with tough situations in their lives, especially with Howl's... but, in fact, Sophie is falling in love with him! so maybe Howl isn't so wicked after all. could love break both Sophie's & Howl's curse? could it just possibly stop the war Ingary, the land they live in, is having? well, you'll just have to watch it & find out! it may be confusing but, don't worry, I'll give you a quick spoiler: the story is a lot like world war II!<br/><br/>anyway, I highly recommend you see this, for both children & adults!"
"pixelberry","10","4","6","30 June 2005"," Howl's Moving Castle is absolutely amazing!
","I wasn't really sure what to expect when I went to see this movie, but I was really blown away by its amazing story. I had never heard of Diana Wynne Jones' books, so I knew almost nothing about the plot. The movie may be confusing at points, but I saw it several times and I think you have to watch it more than once to understand exactly what is going on. But, as usual, Hayao Miyazaki did an amazing job with this movie, and it is well worth the price of a movie ticket.<br/><br/>Some Miyazaki fans feel like this movie was a disappointment after the splendor of Spirited Away. But I heard Miyazaki say that Spirited Away would be his last movie because it was so wonderful, so I don't think his fans should expect Moving Castle to surpass Spirited Away in any form. The story lines are so different that you almost can't compare them at all. While Spirited Away is more elegant and Asian in its themes and its storyline, Moving Castle is a much more European. Because the story is so much more western, the music and scenery are very different from Spirited Away, which I think was very appropriate. Overall, I think the techniques Miyazaki used really fit the story well and that's why I gave this movie a 10 out of 10."
"Chapaev36","10","4","6","30 June 2005"," I was not disappointed
","I went to see Miyazaki's newest work ""Howl's Moving Castle"" with some minor trepidation. This was not a pet project for him from the start so I had reservations as to whether it would be able to match the visual mastery of his earlier works. I was delighted to find out that Miyazaki delivered a film that has become an instant favorite with me.<br/><br/>Being a Miayzaki enthusiast, I have seen all of the master's feature length directorial efforts. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" now only trails ""My Neightbour Totoro"" as my favorite Miyazaki work. What works for me the most in this film is that Miyzaki was able to join together the best of his early and later film-making traits into a brilliant baroque work of art. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" possesses the innocence and quiet beauty of his earlier films and the haunting, darker, more brooding excellence of ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"".<br/><br/>As with ""Mononoke"" and ""Nausicaa"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a deviation of a previous Miyazaki film. It is, in many ways, reminiscent to Laputa: Castle In The Sky when one considers elements such as Howl's castle paralleled with the castle of Laputa, the central theme of war and the multidimensional villains (or are they? Consider how Miyazaki's characters are rarely purely evil, as there are layers of goodness in all of them).<br/><br/>There is a scene in this film that had me in awe and made me realize that I was witnessing a masterpiece within a masterpiece. It is delightfully underplayed. When Howl sends old Sophie to see madame Suliman she winds up climbing a dreadfully long set of stairs with the witch of the waste on the way to Suliman's castle. I was astounded with Miyazaki's craftsmanship here. First of all, the visuals are astounding and and humorously over-the-top. Miyazaki wickedly underscores the age of Sophie and the obesity of the witch of the west to bring out the humanity of both of these characters, their weaknesses in particular. Miyazaki is also very consistently patient here - one would expect in a Disney movie for the director to simply cut from the bottom of the stairs to the top of the stairs as the characters come to the entrance but he lets the viewer in on this amusing experience. There are nice subtle touches here like Suliman's dog who is carried by Sophie to make the experience even more strenuous for her. Miyazaki also goes to great lengths to show Sophie's kindness - this first becomes evident on the stairs when she is surprisingly sympathetic to the witch, developing into a central themes of the film - the theme of kindness, forgiveness and understanding.<br/><br/>These characters are multidimensional, they have human traits and allow the viewer to identify. Miyazaki's approach is the complete polar opposite to that of American animators who worked on cartoons like the roadrunner and the coyote or Bugs Bunny. These characters are mortal - they feel pain, they feel joy and sadness and we are in on this to experience these feelings as well. Miyazaki never cheats the audience with pop culture references or token characters - there is warmth and touching humanity even in the most cunning personages. This is missing today in works by studios such as Disney where we expect characters to be immortal, even in the most violent sequences. Miyazaki borrows more from Russian animation - works like ""Hedgehog in the Fog"" and ""The Snow Queen"" - to make these characters absorbing and devoid of clichés.<br/><br/>""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a film for all ages, moreso than his previous two efforts which seemed to cater to adults, I would say. This film's humour, I felt, was much sharper than in ""Spirited Away"", bringing back Miyazaki's patented light-hearted silliness of ""Porco Rosso"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"". I felt that I had to have been missing something in the character of Howl (as I saw the dubbed version into English) - he is serious, tragic yet also surprisingly goofy, especially in his obsession over his looks, specifically his hair. I am looking forward to seeing this with subtitles so I can admire the Japanese voicework to see if Christian Bale's dubbing was appropriate.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this masterpiece enough. If this is Miyazaki's swan song it could not be more appropriate.<br/><br/>4/4"
"satoarchie","10","4","6","29 June 2005"," Deep story and wonderful images
","I was waiting and waiting for this movie to come out in US and finally did. I saw 4 times already, but try to go see it again. Because every time I watch this movie I find something new. It is like this movie have many layers and if you view this movie from different characters point of view, the story seems to offer something a bit different. (Sophie's point of view is the exactly the same as Howl, and if you watch the movie sympathizing to Sophie you will have a different perspective of the tale....it is not too easy to explain....but basically his characters have a life of its own and you can feel their emotions and reasons why they say or do things!) I think that is a magic of Miyazaki''s movie. He puts so much effort of developing the story line and it is not only one dimension, but all characters have their own. It may seem too much information and too rushing toward the end when I went to see it at first, but then once you (sort of) figure out the story, it is pretty natural that things happen that way. Like the world we live in all of us have different story to tell....<br/><br/>His visual is simply stunning....it is amazing what he show us! <br/><br/>All I can say is you should go to the theater to watch this movie to all people. It is worth watching it in the large screen!"

","When's the last time you sat in the theater with a crowd of all ages and everyone had a good time? It happened to me today.<br/><br/>I've read William Goldman talk about how the director gets too much credit for film, but there are certain directors whose work make his argument ring hollow. To see this movie directly after ROTS (Revenge of the Sith) is a particular treat - Miyazaki and his brilliant low-tech artisans bring more character, surprise, care and intensity to their work than George Lucas and his amazing high-tech staff ever could. <br/><br/>A beautiful film that deserves all its good press. What a nice change..."
"qball_82","8","4","6","12 June 2005"," Miyazaki delivers again
","I love these experiences I get from Miyazaki, I never fail to be moved or affected in some way after watching one of his films. Whether it's transporting the viewer to another world completely or simply portraying the subtle visual nuances of a character, not many film makers can compare.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderfully bizarre, imaginative tale and serves as the perfect basis for Miyazaki's vision and style. Though it's not quite up there with Spirited Away or Mononoke Hime, Miyazaki doesn't disappoint and the film is filled with breathtaking visuals, charming characters, humor, romance, drama, all of it. I was a little apprehensive seeing the dubbed version, but my doubts were unfounded as the English actors all did a great job.<br/><br/>I had a couple of minor gripes about the film. The story doesn't seem as solid and cohesive as Miyazaki's earlier works, if I had to use one word to describe it it would be ""scattered"". The characters also seem to lack the depth of those in other Miyazaki films and I would think this is because much of their histories and motives are left unexplained, the viewer is left to simply accept them as they are, left wanting more.<br/><br/>Compared to other Miyazaki films, Howl's Moving Castle doesn't quite feel as complete. Compared to any other animated offering out there, this film (along with the rest of Miyazaki's), is in a league of its own. An amazing film experience - do not miss it!"

","There is a lot of very high praise being thrown about in these reviews, which I can only imagine is coming from Miyazaki fans who automatically love anything that he does. Because while this animated feature is an admirable piece of visual art, it lacks any other redeemable traits.<br/><br/>The plot is nonsensical and full of loose ends (and loose beginnings). The characters behave in frustratingly random and unexplained ways. The core plot points are half-baked. And the ending is truly terrible. As I neared the end of this overly long story, I was just wishing it would be over already, and when the end did come, it seemed as though the director was in just as much of a hurry for it to end as I was. The ending felt rushed and corny, with a good dose of deus ex machina which still failed to bring sense to the plot.<br/><br/>Read the book - it's pretty good. But give this movie a miss."
"mackiepg","4","9","18","18 March 2006"," The book's assassination
","I love Miyazaki's movies. In fact, I have seen most of his movies.<br/><br/>However, after watching ""Howl's moving Castle"" I was very disappointed. I thought that Miyazaki killed the book ""Howl's moving castle"" by making this terrible adaptation. Did Miyazaki understand the book when he read it? He simplified the story so much, and yet he made it somewhat confusing because there wasn't any explanation to why things happened in the film.<br/><br/>I wonder if any of the people that think the movie is so good has read the book.<br/><br/>First: The most pointless part of the film is the war.<br/><br/>Second: The film didn't explain why Sophie was cursed in the first place. There was no explanation for the pointless war either. It seemed that the story was floating around. The plot was not well developed.<br/><br/>Third: They changed all the characters, and their personalities.<br/><br/>Fourth: There were a lot of clichéd things. Miyazaki preferred to replace parts of the book that showed originality with clichéd scenes that can happen in any fantasy story.<br/><br/>For example: Sophie going to Howl's childhood telling him to meet her in the future. (time travel) Example 2: Sophie kisses the scarecrow, and the scarecrow becomes a human because of the kiss from his true love(Sophie).<br/><br/>If you thought this movie is good, you should read the book. After you read it, you might hate the movie. The book is funny, original, and full of magic. It can't be compared to the movie."

","While I enjoyed the animation and the style of the film, about an hour into it I became increasingly uncomfortable as the true roles of the characters began to emerge. I found the final plot to be somewhat incoherent and very problematic in terms of reinforcing negative gender stereotypes and un-empowering gender roles. For example, why is the main female character and an additional female character attracted to Howl when he is never around, highly volatile and outrageously needy? Why does the main female character give up her hat business to clean his castle? Why are age and weight the predominate indicators of social disgust and unattractiveness? Why does Howl's big scene displaying his love for the main character consist of little more than buying her gifts and showing off his power? Why is the broomstick the most considerate, caring male character in the picture and also the one that no one wants to be in love with? I have very little experience with children's films, but would like to think that a theater full of attentive, undiscerning children would be an arena that demanded a higher level of responsibility in terms of presenting characters that empower the viewers as opposed to propagate oppressive stereotypes."
"toll-8","4","5","9","4 May 2012"," Great imagery but poor story
","Howl's Moving Castle is directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who is a well know Japanese director for producing some of the best 2D animation films since the old school Disney ones. His vision is always extraordinary and inventive, and this trademark is continued in Howl's Moving Castle. Unfortunately though it is not as good as his previous film Spirited Away, which is a lot better. This could be because at least Spirited Away had a story that you can grasp onto. Howl's Moving Castle doesn't have much of a plot to really hook you in, and I found myself floating in and out of the film due to this problem.<br/><br/>The story follows a young girl called Sophie, who is rescued by some obnoxious guards by the notorious wizard Howl (Bale). This moment is watched by the Witch of the Waste (Bascall) who, when Sophie is alone, casts a spell on her out of jealousy, turning Sophie into an old woman. After this change Sophie, who is now known as Grandma Sophie (Simmons), heads up the mountain in search of Howl, in the hope that he can reverse the spell. When she finds his home, which is a giant misshaped castle made out of unshaped metal pieces on legs, she enters it to find a young wizard learning from Howl, and a talking fire call Calcifer. When Howl returns to his home she tells him she is the new housekeeper, and decides to befriend Howl before asking for his help. Whilst she cleans for him she mixes up his box of magic, causing him to lose his power. At this Sophie must go and visit his former mentor, Madame Suliman (Danner), to gain back his power and this visit causes the Madame into uproar and she declares war between two worlds, with Howl seeming to be one of the only ones who can defend it. From here the truth about Howl's magic powers come to the surface, and we find out that he may not be all that he seems. Will Sophie be able to ever go back to her former self?<br/><br/>The synopsis above is rather vague as the story of Howl's Moving Castle is also very vague. It is slightly difficult to follow and doesn't really make much sense. These animated Japanese films, directed by Miyazaki, are often about magic, potions, and objects that are not of this world, but usually we can buy into them easier then what this film allows us to. The characters aren't as well developed as well as they are in Spirited Away and this helps less in enjoying the story.<br/><br/>Half of this problem though could be down to me. This sort of film isn't particularly to my liking, Spirited Away was a slight exception, and due to this I find my mind wandering throughout and not really concentrating on the film. Reading other opinions on the film, I do see that I am not the only one who struggled to really grasp the plot, but I do seem to be the only one that isn't a huge fan of these movies. They can be good just this one wasn't particularly.<br/><br/>I watched the English version of this film, which is why I have credited English actors above. I have been told that the Japanese speaking version is better as some of the dialogue is lost in translation and the Japanese voices are much more enthusiastic. The voices in English are typical of the actor and little emotion seems to be involved, that is other than Billy Crystal as Calcifer who steals the show. Christian Bale doesn't strain his voice, and is so much like him that the minute he spoke I knew it was someone I had heard before. It took me a few minutes to realise and again this was a few minutes that I spent not really indulging in the film. I do prefer a good animation when the voices aren't obvious of the actor.<br/><br/>All in all it isn't the best Japanese animated film. Some of the imagery is beautiful and the moving castle is very imaginative indeed. However this is nowhere near as good as Spirited Away and if you feel the need to watch a Japanese animated movie, I suggest you rent that instead.<br/><br/>2 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","Having seen (and loved) Laputa many years ago and then being re-introduced to Ghibli's work via Sprited Away, I have recently been working my way through the back catalogue. Miyazaki has his name associated with some truly remarkable films (Laputa, Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, etc...) however he has also been involved in making some films which are little more than impenetrable clap-trap. Sadly Howl's Moving Castle falls into the second category (along with Nausicaa IMO). The plot is almost non-existent, and what little story remains is confusing and fragmented. The film suffers from the same problems as Nausicaa, in that an intriguing premise is established, but which never reaches a satisfying conclusion."

Way to short for such a long movie. ""Hey, I'm a cursed prince..."" lol. Well, I don't want to be too harsh, it had really good elements, but I expected much more of it. But that's my own fault.

"Michael Kenmore","2","9","20","19 March 2006"," Miyazaki's most confounding and least compelling film to date
","I don't have much to say about the movie reiterating the points of the plot as already explained by comments below, other than the fact that I thought it cannot be possible to top or even equal the top-notch quality and subliminally emotional power of the magic fantasy hybrid of the Grimm Brothers, Lewis Carroll & Japanese folklore in Spirited Away.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle retains some of Hayao Miyazaki's magic in storytelling and animation but it's not certainly his best. In fact, it's his worst since the embarrassingly contrived Kiki's Delivery Service.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the strange mess of Howl's Moving Castle confirms there is a theoretical pattern that Miyazaki does his best when he creates original stories inspired by the fantastic works of European & Asian literature and turn out fantastic animated films and manga, but his skills do not translate well in the attempted adaptation of previous published works.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I have a great deal of admiration for Mr. Miyazaki. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind comic book series is a worthy companion piece to C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien's famous epic literacy works. He has an incredibly imaginary mind with the penchant for telling outlandish stories reminiscent of Aesop and Hans Christian Anderson. That's the only positive compliment I have for Howl's Moving Castle in spite of its mind-bendingly glaring story and character development flaws.<br/><br/>The story as written by Mr. Miyazaki (I watched the Japanese version with English subtitles instead of awful-sounding English dub) starts all right. . .then it became a confounding mess leading to the bizarre ending that feels rushed as though the production schedule had to be fulfilled on time in time for a projected theatrical release. Tim Burton's horrible 2001 re-make of Planet of the Apes suffered the same ""rushed production"" effect and this lesson remains unlearned.<br/><br/>A further production delay with Miyazaki's storyboard revision to iron out the problems might have improved the ending and clarify some plot points and character development to keep the story consistent, but that wasn't the option. Studio Ghibli and its subcontractors came close to missing the production deadline for Spirited Away (as tensely explained in a documentary as an extra on Region 1 DVD) but miraculously turned out a masterpiece right on schedule.<br/><br/>So Howl's Moving Castle, however visually pleasant, falters in the second and third act in terms of marginal storytelling. The film resorts to Miyazaki's scenarios that border on the incomprehensibly bizarre towards the closing. Not to mention the fact the movie carry the sledgehammer approach to delivering the main theme. It's better to be subliminal than to be so screeningly obvious it becomes annoying that may inspire ""who cares?"" apathy at the end when the two-hour ordeal is over.<br/><br/>I get the point, Studio Ghibli. Try to be coherent and subtle in the next Miyazaki production, please.<br/><br/>The last third of the movie embodies the term ""deus ex machina"". Look the phrase up in a dictionary. That's why the movie is an abominable mess that render the plot incomprehensible that rely on overactive imagination to move the movie along to unsustainable and unnecessarily overlong length. The Neverending Story this movie ain't. It probably isn't faithful to the source material, either.<br/><br/>* out of four, courtesy of a very disappointed Miyazaki fan."

"mysteriouspersonage","1","14","35","22 March 2008"," I have watched this film 3 times, purely because enjoy criticising it
","--before i say anything let me just say ordinarily i am quite a fan of Miyazaki, i have seen Spirited Away and enjoyed it imensly and now own, however all directors make mistakes (Tim Burton directed 'Mars Attacks' remember) and playing with the plot of Diana Wynne Jone's best book is definitely a mistake--<br/><br/>I have to admit, picking holes in things is like a hobby to me but in the case of 'Howl's Moving Castle' I know i am quite right to do so. I can't even give this film a 2 for it's pretty pictures, i hate it too much!<br/><br/>Why do this to that story!? Considering the standard of Diana Wynne Jones' book it is hard to see how this film could have such a weak plot. I can't understand why Miyazaki would take such a wonderful story and put it through a mangle.<br/><br/>When i first heard there was going to be a film made of my favourite book of all time I failed to see how this could go wrong, when I saw what the castle was going to look like i was even more optimistic the style of animation seemed to suit the book rather well, i am now forced to eat my words.<br/><br/>None of the character's look quite right, Howl looks like an inflatable chair on stilts, Sophie just looks plain pathetic and Calcifer looks as if he's just come off the British Gas advert. Calcifer should be genuinely frightening, not comical.<br/><br/>The film had a promising start, Sophie's lines were remarkably corny and she herself was so nice and quiet she became detestable, she showed no character whatsoever and she didn't talk to hats but apart from that the castle looked promising and Market Chipping wasn't too bad either if you ignored the ridiculous aeroplanes and tanks. Then Howl appeared and it all went downhill from there.<br/><br/>Howl is welsh. One of the reasons I like the book so much is it is one of the only books that uses a Welsh hero, when i read it I also give him a welsh accent in my mind. It surely wouldn't be too much to ask to get Christian Bale, who I found out after watching it is in fact welsh, to put on a welsh accent at all? In stead he puts on this dull deep droning voice which I find both dull and creepy simultaneously.<br/><br/>The story is terrible, nothing is explained. Whilst in the book an explanation is provided for why the witch curses Sophie, why the scarecrow roams the hills and why Calcifer asks Sophie in particular to break his contract with Howl no such explanation is provided here.<br/><br/>Before I forget to mention it i must also tell you that I find the characters tedious and dull. Each one being far to perfect. The Sophie of the book is presumptuous, intruding, outspoken and nosey and Howl clearly recognises this and finds her irritating and tiresome. Howl is vain, cowardly, selfish and careless all of which Sophie takes note of and finds him frustrating and despicable, on several occasions she attempts to leave the castle having no patience left. Neither of them are perfect and neither of them so much as pretend to like each other.<br/><br/>As for the love element, it barely emerges until the last few pages. Sophie goes through most of the book without even realising she's fallen in love with Howl, certainly neither of them would confess to anyone but each other in the final few pages and even then it extends merely to Howl saying 'I think we ought to live happily ever after, don't you?' in a welsh accent of course. In the film it's obvious and it makes me cringe. Sophie is too nice.<br/><br/>I won't go too far into the other plot differences although their are plenty but major things this film misses is the intriguing dog-man, the seven-league boots, the chilling English teacher Miss Angorian, and the individual love stories between Sophie's sister Lettie and Percival, and Sophie's half-sister Martha and Michael (the equivalent of the film's Markle but about sixteen instead of six). And not to mention Sophie and Michael's short but amusing adventure into Howl's own world and his native country modern-day Wales.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is clearly weak and far to simplified. Instead of wathcing the tedious and predictable plot of the film unfold why not enjoy the surprising if slightly more complex but far more amusing and likable plot of the book instead? People who read the book love it, in fact the majority of people who have read DWJ's 'Howl's Moving Castle' would tell you it's better than Harry Potter, read the amazon reviews if you don't believe me, they say it all.<br/><br/>Ooo! Now I'm angry! I just read a review on here blaming the book. the Book!!! It makes me angry since this person clearly hasn't read the book they just assume that of so perfect Miyazaki couldn't have made a mistake so blame the book!!! The idea of it!!! I sgree the plot and characters in the film are awful but don't blame the book!!! Read the book, Howl's a coward in the book and he's a lot more likable that way, and he gets drunk at one point read it!"
"trexx-ch","4","4","7","13 April 2010"," uninspired and corny
","I can't understand why so many reviews here are full of praise for that movie. Compared to spirited away, Howl is just weak. Spirited away was charming, subtle and full of great ideas. Howl recycles a lot of these ideas and adds nothing new. It is full of corny dialogs and has a very cheesy ending, which delivers the final blow to the movie.<br/><br/>The main character Howl is a run-of-the-mill anime figure with annoying gestures and facial expressions (funny detail: his hair is always wobbling around, which reminds me a bit of a hair shampoo commercial). Calcifer, the fire-demon, you could also find in a Disney production (which is not a compliment, in my opinion). The evil witch, who becomes a good witch later in the movie, would be nice, if we haven't seen the same ""evil enemy becomes nice guy"" thing in spirited away before.<br/><br/>The general artwork however, is good. The best thing is the moving castle itself, which is the most innovative idea you'll see in this movie. Howl is not a terrible movie, but it's below average - see it when you don't have anything better to do."
"knappster1111","10","4","7","2 June 2005"," Highly entertaining Miyazaki
","Howl's Moving Castle review:<br/><br/>NOTE: (The version I saw was the original Japanese version with English subtitles) Howl's Moving Castle, I can already, say is front runner for best animated feature of the year. Miyazaki has done it again. The magic is still here. So far I've yet to see a bad Miyazaki film, which just shows that he is one of the most creative and inventive animators of all time. His works inspire and enthrall us. <br/><br/>Not too long ago, he gave us his first big film, Castle in the Sky, a good film with wonderful animation. He followed up by the fun family film, My Neighbor Totoro, which was also good but not near as good as some seemed to think (ala Roger Ebert). He made other little hits here and there, but nothing compared to when he made his first big hit, Princess Mononoke, one of the best film's of '98. The animation was that much better than his previous films, and the story was a lot more involving than say ""Totoro's"". Following this, he created Spirited Away, a true masterpiece and definitely one of the bests films of 2002. A film that deservedly won best animated film at the Academy Awards. I think that Spirited Away may become a great classic someday in Anime history, as Snow White has done in Disney history. It had breathtaking visuals and an even more interesting (and totally bizarre) story than ""Mononoke"". <br/><br/>While ""Spirited"" and ""Mononoke"" may be hard to top, Howl's Moving Castle sure comes close. Its visuals are stunning, the characters are just as ever entertaining, (I especially loved the character Calucifer, who is an ""evil"" made entirely out of fire; or there's turnip head who's a scarecrow with magic that makes him alive) and the story this time while mostly fantasy, actually has a more realistic side plot: The war. This adds some interesting twists to the story, and really makes it that more original than any of his other films. Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke may be impossible to beat, but Howl's Moving Castle can definitely stand on it's own.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's films seem to have constant trends, similar characters, and sometimes identical story elements. But that is not to say that all his films are exactly alike. It is just interesting to watch and observe and realize that Miyazaki has made a world of his own and these films inhabit that world. Every time we see a Miyazaki film, we are seeing the world through his eyes. And, oh is it a wonderful place. <br/><br/>You might notice a lot of characters that are alike in his films, especially his usage of young girls as main characters. And what would a Miyazaki film be without: strange, obscure oozing creatures, crazy old woman, and people who can transform into animals. And don't forget, what's a Miyazaki film without flying.<br/><br/>These are all themes of Miyazaki. This is his style, and it may perhaps be the new Disney. While American hand-drawn cartoons are dying out, and computer animated cartoons are becoming the new trend, it's still good to know that we have Miyazaki films to look forward to the good, old-fashioned way."

"arkif1","10","3","5","24 February 2007"," Mut und Willenskraft, besitzt du sie?
","(German: Bravery and volition, do you own them? - Recruiting poster in Sophie's city)<br/><br/>I had to watch this three times. The first time to memorise the different themes in this film, i.e. curses and preparation. The second time to really understand what all this is about. And the third time to become emotionally involved.<br/><br/>""Spirited Away"" is by comparison pretty straight, this film is a little overcrowded. If this would be a Wagner opera, then it'd be ""Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg"". But I like this film more, it only shares its complexity and the corniness of its love theme with that opera. Speaking of music, that's quite a job on this one. From second Vienna school à la Berg over cosmopolitan à la Korngold to Vienna operetta à la Strauss, a fitting counterpart to the visual amalgamation of European architectures and machinery presented in this film.<br/><br/>It's an indifferent could have been land, mixing German, French and English influences, located for most of its aspects around 1900. There is one major deviation from this setting, namely the battle ships, which are a clear WW II reference. In WW I it were the soldiers themselves who had to face the unspeakable, not the civilians.<br/><br/>Now, the film is about love. It makes a vital point. That ""Mut und Willenskraft"" are necessary to steer your course in life, but that you are facing a double challenge, not only to be brave and determined, but also to use your virtue for the right purpose in a world that is specialised in harvesting inexperienced young men for any kind of purpose. It might be for sexual consumption, like the Witch of the Waste is doing it. Or it might be to channel their strength into inhumane efforts, like Lady Suliman does.<br/><br/>The film tells in fact many such stories, stories about people that subscribed their force to aims that make them both unfree and inhumane. And it tells stories about the tasks those face who want to rise to the occasion of their own lives.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful film. Poetical, rich, true. Perhaps too rich, you have to take some effort and time for it to work."
"jluis1984","10","3","5","12 May 2006"," Near-perfect fantasy from genius Miyazaki...
","Director Hayao Miyazaki has always given more than simple animated films. With deep roots in the fantasy genre, his stories go beyond the concept of fable and become epic stories of love, drama and comedy thanks to his highly developed writing style and his multidimensional characters. ""Hauru no Ugoku Shiro"" or ""Howl's Moving Castle"", is a film that serves as very good example of Miyazaki's style; it contains the epic fantasy elements he has constantly developed since his debut in 1984 with Kaze no Tani no Naushika (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds) and also contains the light-hearted comedy of efforts like ""Majo no Takkyûbin"" (Kiki's Delivery Service) of 1989.<br/><br/>The movie is set in a fantasy version of Europe where magic and technology coexist. Sophie is a young girl in a small town of a nation on the verge of war; she is very mature and responsible but is also very shy and unconfident. One night she is visited by the Witch of Watse, and transformed into an old woman. Since the curse forbids her to speak about the curse itself, she decides to go and find a way to return to her real age by herself, but in her quest she ends up in the fabled Moving Castle of the legendary wizard Howl, who is said to be a cruel ruthless monster. She will discover that Howl is very different than what legends say.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Miyazaki completely makes the story his own while still retaining the story's core plot. This in no ways means that the adaptation is not good, it just means it is different. As usual, Miyazaki focuses in his favorite themes of love, redemption and catharsis and gives the story his touch. The humane traits of the characters makes them multidimensional and like in the rest of his work, there is no clear good and evil, only complex relations between characters.<br/><br/>As I wrote above, the film feels like a summary of Mizayaki's previous work and it is probably the movie that most clearly defines the director's style and philosophy. The classical elements of epic quests are present but are mixed with elements of romance and comedy that never feel out of place. Miyazaki mixes genres perfectly and gives the movie an unnatural charm that can only be described as magic.<br/><br/>Of course, the animation is top-notch like Studio Ghibli usually does. The beautiful landscapes inspired by European towns and cities make a great contrast with the advanced technology and the visually stunning magic of this fantastic world. The Moving Castle, a walking metal behemoth, is at the same time imposing and strangely beautiful. There is no scene in the movie that is not either beautiful, mesmerizing or both. The animation by itself is a work of art.<br/><br/>The characters are very well defined and are very likable. It is easy to identify with them thanks to the very well-written script. The detailed emotions the characters have go beyond simple plot points, and it was great to see so complex characters come to life in an animated film. I have not heard the English dubbing, but I must say that the Japanese one truly captured the feeling of the characters and as usual in Ghibli, the cast was up to the challenge.<br/><br/>""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a very enjoyable film that displays Miyazaki's style at its best. It is a great film not only for kids or fans of Japanese animation, but for the general audience. Very few films these days capture this kind of magic, and I must add that ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is not only among Hayao Miyazaki's best works, it is one of the best films of the last years. 10/10"
"Quentintarantado","10","3","5","12 April 2006"," Bittersweet movie about romance and old age
","I think many people are complaining about Miyazake because his movies are starting to look alike and their plots are beginning to get very similar. I don't have problems with that. The elderly Sofi here looks a little like Yubaba in Spirited Away and Dola in Castle in the Sky. However, you can generalize that all anime women look alike with their huge eyes and we can even go racist and say all black people look alike to Asians and Asians look alike to Americans and Mexicans, Spaniards and Argentinians look alike to Asians.<br/><br/>Miyazake is animating and he's doing what he knows best. His Nausicaa looks like they borrowed clothes from his TV series, Conan, Boy of the Future (and his son's upcoming film, Gedo Senki, looks like they borrowed production and costume designs from Nausicaa). I look at it this way, they are riffs of the same theme, similar yet different, and each riff is a gift for humanity and I have no cause for complaint. Miyazake has white hair and I would want him to work on forever but I'm going to break my heart over him one day so I'm grateful for every film he makes. He will never do less than his best anyway.<br/><br/>Despite this apology for his work (which does not need excuses anyway), Howl's Moving Castle has many virtues that makes it stand out from Miyazake's body of outstanding films. The movie has a tender eye for the elderly. It's a better version of the tale told in the Freaky Friday movies and 18 Again, because it's really told by an old man.<br/><br/>And again, Miyazake repeats his refusal to make true villains out of his characters. A villain at the start will appear again in a wilted, helpless form, then still later as a supplicant, then finally as a friend.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, Miyazake, that old master, has made me half in love with Sofi myself, whether she's the old lady with creaking bones, or the young girl with severe, conservative clothes, or the old lady with quick thinking and lightning reflexes or the young girl with hair like starlight, she's a complex creation, golden hearted yet not maudlin, plain in looks yet beautiful whether young or old."

","This movie was a gift for my two children from and Aunt. I have watched it with them twice in the past few days. It is absolutely wonderfully captivating and romantic. I am a grown woman and I fell in love with the character of Howl. There is something about his voice that is every woman's dream---a man that will protect what he loves. Right away you view Sophi, a timid but kindhearted girl working in her family's hat shop, playing it safe and watching her mother hobnob with the rich crowd in town. Suddenly, you are bedazzled as she is swept off her feet by a handsome wizard who protects her from some would-be harmful men. Her life completely changes from there. This movie grabs you and pulls you in!---and I never thought I would be saying that about an anime. Mr. Miyazaki (Director) always seems to outdo himself! I definitely recommend this movie and Spirited Away, too, if you have never seen that."
"derekcsea","9","3","5","3 March 2006"," Howl's Flying Castle is magically ephemeral with heart
","Howl's Flying Castle has that unique Miyazaki flair (Spirited Away). The movie masterfully succeeds in achieving a balance between light fiction and deeper meaning exposition. Miyazaki paints an other-worldly environment filled with flying machines, monsters, princes, kings, and wizards, while maintaining subtle messages about freedom of the heart and persevering will.<br/><br/>The movie at times almost seems stream of conscious. The plot meanders to introduce dynamic, colorful characters. However, the focus on the characters proves artistic and compelling; any tangents taken to introduce new characters breathes more life into a film that radiates with personality.<br/><br/>Howle's flying Castle sparkles from the very beginning with beautiful animated scenes and colors intertwined with compelling and unique characters. However, the one weakness to the movie was the ending. It remained consistent to the simplistic charm of the movie, but almost too much so- the ending seemed like an understatement of the entire movie. Some cliché means were used to break the curses placed on the characters, but overall the beauty of the movie more than made up for a plain ending."

","I haven't seen too many of Miyazaki's movies (besides Spirited Away and Totoro), but this sure beats any Disney productions. The movie was thoroughly enjoyable, though it employs too many tricks from the director's previous works. For those who have seen Spirited Away, I find too many similarities between it & Howl's Moving Castle. I can't remember the name of the dragon wizard in Spirited Away but I feel that Howl is like an adult version of the dragon wizard. For instance, both are ""trapped"" by some form of evil forces and risk turning into demons. the whole plot was also a tad too confusing. I had to watch it twice to grasp the full meaning. (and even after that, I'm not sure I really do understand it). I therefore won't recommend it to young viewers. One wonderful surprise after i finished watching the movie was that the charming Japanese actor Takuya Kimura was actually the voice for Howl. And I so regret not paying enough attention to Howl's voice. That's one reason why you should always watch the original version of the movie."

","Having seen Spirited Away I came to this movie with high expectations. However those were slightly dampened by again seeing the Disney brand attached to this man's wonderful work. I have browsed a lot of sites, reviews, etc to see if anybody else came away from this movie with the same impression as me and so far I have not seen any similar views. Maybe some of this site's users can give me some feedback. The references to The Wizard of Oz are numerous and obvious and yet there seems to be a subtext here that is not so much explained by The Wizard of Oz but is more in keeping with a Japanese man who knows his work will be distributed by a major American company. The images of war and aerial bombings are not in keeping with a treatment of Oz and it is only when you view the ""Wicked Witch of the Waste"" in her powerless state with her bulbous, purple nose puffing on a cigar that only one character comes to mind. Winston Churchill! This movie to me is a Japanese viewpoint on World War II. When viewed in this light even the blob-men who come out at night during bombings take on a cancerous appearance that echoes the mutations suffered by generations of Japanese civilians post Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even the main character, Howl, suffers a struggle of duality where he was once blonde, beautiful and pure but is increasingly in danger of turning into a large black bird due to his increasing involvement in war. The more this movie continues the more his bird-form resembles the black eagle of Nazi Germany. To me this movie is an attempt to explain the duality of Japan's involvement in the war. Continue to fight and end up as the fascist state of the southern hemisphere or withdraw and yield to the inevitable revenge bombings of the US as retaliation for Pearl Harbour. You may call me mad but there are many more instances to support this theory scattered throughout the movie and that is why I don't think this is a great movie. It is too concerned with making a heartfelt point while dressing it up in a more superficial wrapping as a Wizard of Oz-like commentary on age and beauty. However, this is probably the most subversive movie we will see for many a time."

","Hayao Miyazaki has done it again! This lively adventure captivated my heart and took me to where my imagination never dared to go! Sophie, a 18-year old girl, worked in a hat shop, which was passed down to her from her father. One day, while she was walking in a alley, she is confronted by two men who seem to be flirting or trying to get a number. Luckily, sexy Howl (voice by Christian Bale) saves her and takes her through a unforgettable stroll in the sky. But, the Witch of the Waste (voice by Lauren Bacall) finds out about this stroll and casts a wicked curse on Sophie, making her a 90-year old woman. From there, old Sophie walks great lengths to find this witch and comes upon Howl's Moving Castle. She then meets Calcifer (voice by Billy Crystal), a smart-mouthed and witty fire demon and a aspiring young magician named Markl (voice by Josh Hutcherson). Sophie then falls dramatically in love with Howl. Howl often turns into a bird-like figure, trying to stop the idiotic war that is going on, and in result, comes back to his castle in blood or slime. Whenever Sophie would feel beautiful or happy, her true young self would reappear, but vanish if she began negative. Howl and Sophie go through hard times and adventurous moments, but come out OK. This wonderful romance was sweet and simple. DO NOT MISS HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE!"

","This a movie that anyone can enjoy, from your grandmother to grandkids, without being too fluffy. (There are plenty of explosions for those who need them. *laughs*) I saw this while in Japan on vacation and it was certainly worth the 1800 yen (about $18) I paid for the privilege. This is an adaption of the book by Diana Wynne Jones, so don't be surprised when you hear English names throughout. While I normally disapprove of overhauling a novel for the big screen, this is one occasion when it seriously needed it and it was masterfully done. Howl is a far more admirable character in the film than he was in the book and the movie moves along at a fair clip without ever getting bogged down. Sophie's many transformations from young to old to not so old to young and back again (many of them very short-lived) are wonderfully done and add a wonderful dimension to the story that I'm sure Ms. Jones would (and probably does) approve of. The book was perfect as a book, but the screenplay is perfect for the screen while retaining the essence of the book. I look forward to dragging my friends to the theater to see if the translators and English voice actors have done it justice."

"crashmasterd","7","4","8","18 June 2005"," My Personal disappointment
","Having waited eagerly for ""Howl's Moving Castle"" ever since I learned Miazaki was directing it I have to say I was disappointed. In my opinion this is the worst of all Miazaki's films. <br/><br/>Please don't get me wrong, this is a really good movie. It was enjoyable and technically beautiful. The animation couldn't have been better, and at times even verge on genius. The character of Sofi moves so naturally from the young girl to the old woman that you completely believe that they are one person. Sometimes you will catch a turn of the old woman's face and see the perfect reflection of the young girl that is trapped inside. This is something only the greatest of artists can accomplish.<br/><br/>Where the movie breaks down is in it's mishmash of a plot and it's few likable characters. Other than the love story going on here the plot is hollow and lacks any motivation. It seems like there's a whole lot going on in the background that we need to know for it to make sense. Everything is ambiguous, and nothing is ever tied up to any real satisfaction. Then, suddenly a plot point will jump out, make an appearance, and never be resolved. I find this unfortunate.<br/><br/>It's sad when of all the characters in the story the one that makes the biggest impression on me is Hin the dog. This weird little mutt steals every scene he's in! Oh, I think the characters of Sofi and the Witch of the Waste are well developed (particularly the Witch of the waste) but other than that I couldn't get involved with anyone. Even Howl seemed one dimensional and lack lustered. <br/><br/>It doesn't help that I was forced to endure Disney's typically poor translation and awful cast. With the notable exceptions of Jean Simmons and Lauren Bacall I thought the casting uninspired. Billy Crystal is particularly bad. He takes what should be, and is, a very important character to the story and makes a poor joke out of it. Un-funny and unsympathetic, he almost single handedly ruined the film for me.<br/><br/>As a Followup to ""Spirited Away"" this movie was a disappointment for me, but even though I consider it Miazaki's worst film you must consider the caliber of his other films. Everything he touches is magic. The worst Miazaki film is still far superior to almost everything else comparable. This could easily be one of the 5 best movies of the year, however the competition isn't that great.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing."

(Protecting nature) The director's different style is perfect to catch this very wonderful book (that everyone should read) It is of course different from the book, but still great.<br/><br/>It is magic, in more than one way - strong logic and linear storytelling is not to be expected, but, much like a dream, the story has it's own, inner logic.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is in the beginning, walking on rooftops.<br/><br/>It is a true marvel."

","If we go back to Spirited away, and more backwards to Mononoke Hime, we discover that Miyazaki has done with Howl's moving castle like a testament of his artwork. It has all the elements that made him what he is right now. The young hero (Sophie in this case) fighting against events that are over it's understatement, the cursed prince, the war feeling, the evil witches, the bizarre monsters, the charming characters... Is like a crossover of all his movies, like a gallery of paintings where you walk and you see each frame of his devious imagination. With the aid of Joe Hisaishi mesmerizing score, Miyazaki takes us to another ocean of original ideas, without being completely original (well, not every animation movie has a moving castle, and such a twisted plot of spells, curses, war and conspiracy). In a year full of Tripods, remakes, polemic movies and some flaws in the box office, Howl's moving castle is a relief. As they said in a Spanish comic book: I think like go to heaven is like enter in a Miyazaki movie. With Howl's moving castle that's a reality."
"Crap_Connoisseur","Null","2","3","26 March 2006"," Miyazaki Is Still King
","Howl's Moving Castle has everything that we've come to expect from Hayao Miyazaki - stunning animation, surrealistic touches and a whimsical storyline. Miyazaki has almost created his own genre, such is the distinctiveness of his work. Howl's Moving Castle is yet another example of why Miyazaki is in a league of his own.<br/><br/>On the surface, Howl's Moving Castle appears to be a rather standard animated film for children, albeit with startlingly good production values. The storyline resembles a fairytale with Sophie, our hard working, plain Jane heroine being cursed by an evil witch. In fact, for the first 10 minutes of the film I feared that Miyazaki had lost his edge. My concerns were put to rest from the moment the witch of the waste's blob like henchmen emerge from the surrounding walls and chase Sophie and Howl through an alley. Miyazaki moves from Cinderella sweetness to Donnie Darko -esque weirdness in the blink of an eye without missing a beat.<br/><br/>The weirdness continues as Sophie is transformed into an old woman and goes off in search of a wizard to help lift her curse. This results in Sophie moving into Howl's castle as his cleaning lady. There should be something seriously subversive about a love story between a young wizard, who really is a bird-like monster with feathers, and an old, hunchbacked woman but within Miyazaki's weird and wonderful world it appears perfectly normal. It is this underlying sense of the surreal that truly sets Miyazaki's work apart. Howl's Moving Castle offers strolls through the sky, alternate realities and a hero who occasionally melts into green sludge.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the animation is breathtaking. The level of detail is astonishing and Miyazaki's sense for time and place is unrivalled. In comparison to this film, Pixar's computer animation feels cold and lifeless. Howl's Moving Castle is a work of art, while films like ""Robots"" and ""Madagascar"" are simply technically proficient. The animation is well matched by a memorable score and excellent voice work. Lauren Bacall stands out as the Witch of the Waste. If I have one complaint, it is with Billy Crystal being cast as Calcifer. His characterisation is a little too ""Dory"" for my liking. Unlike ""Finding Nemo"", this film did not require cheap comedic relief.<br/><br/>By the film's conclusion, Miyazaki has succeeded in taking a fairytale and turning it inside out. Howl's Moving Castle is a magnificent achievement. It may not be quite as audacious as ""Spirited Away"" but in comparison to most children's films, it is positively twisted. Be a cool parent and hire this for your kid instead of dulling their senses with an artistic void like ""Chicken Little""."

"imdb-10985","10","2","3","30 November 2005"," Read the book, watch the movie!
","Howl's Moving Castle was my favourite childhood book. I've read it many times (as an adult too). Diana Wynne Jones weaves the most creative, exciting, fun and magical stories around. I've been fairly annoyed with all the attention (+ movie spin-offs etc.) that JK Rowlings ""Harry Potter"" has received, since they are not, in my opinion, on par with Diana Wynne Jones' truly magical works.<br/><br/>I had always wished that Howl's moving castle would be made into a film, but knew that it would probably be a disappointment. I've been proved wrong, Hayao Miyazaki is probably the only film-maker in the world with the fantastical vision required to bring this story to life.<br/><br/>This is my favourite movie of the year, it has been a dream come true to see this most magical of stories told through Miyazaki's stunning imagery.<br/><br/>My only concern with this is that many people seem to value watching it in the original Japanese with English-subtitles. I feel that this would probably be pretty confusing: an English story, translated to Japanese and then back into English! I've never heard of a translation of a translation that didn't get pretty confused. Besides, the English voice talents are world class, this is not a second-rate manga with a hammed up voice-over."

","I have already read the book version of this, and loved it, so really wanted to see the film version. <br/><br/>I love cartoons as well, and anime, but i was a bit unsure.<br/><br/>It was unbelievable! It totally blows your brains away, and i was all twitchy afterwards and could not stop thinking about it- I had to go home and read the book twice before i calmed down totally.<br/><br/>I am now absolutely obsessed by this film. It enthrals you totally from when Sophie first meets Howl ( flying over the rooftops to escape from black blobs- how cool is that?) until the ending, (which i will not spoil.)<br/><br/>You cannot describe how good this film is- you just have to see it for yourself. It is so much better than Disney, but because it is not a big Hollywood movie it wasn't advertised very well. All the little kids who saw it were gasping and enjoying it far better than some cheesy run of the mill Disney.<br/><br/>The graphics are Amazon, the music is so subtle yet perfect, and the characters are fantastic. It is the best animated film I have ever seen."
"bsinc","9","2","3","14 November 2005"," Beautifully rich with imagination
","I was never a big fan of anime cartoons, to me they seemed very two-sided. On one side you have incredibly fluent and perfectly drawn mind-boggling details, which are mainly used in action scenes, and on the other side you have those crude repetitive monotonous moments of people walking, opening their mouths or just chunks of hair dangling in the wind's breeze where it almost feels as if the animation department is rushing and simplifying their job. ""Hauru No Ugoku Shiro"" starts exactly like the latter and I jumped to a conclusion way too soon. Because what I was about to see was nothing less than magic. I forgot the last time a movie captivated me so strongly, the last time I truly felt that kid I once used to be-this movie delivered big -time. Such creativity and pure fantasy extravaganza is almost unheard of today, yet Hayao Miyazaki lets us indulge in it with such ease and simplistic honesty it feels as if he's the only person in the world with imagination worth mentioning. And his definitely is! A colorful palette of characters and a beautiful story are the key element why this movie is worth seeing. <br/><br/>Recommendations: anyone who misses feeling like the child they were, people who miss creative movies.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Howl's Moving Castle is quite possibly one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in years. It's simply gorgeous, and I came out of the movie theatre in the most amazing mood.<br/><br/>I only discovered Hayao Miyazaki a couple of years ago, and so this was my first chance to view one of his movies at the cinema. I have copies of Spirited Away, Porco Rosso and Princess Mononoke, and so walked into Howl's Moving Castle with very high expectations. I was not disappointed. The animation is rich and lush, with the characters delightful to watch. The voice acting was also a pleasant surprise. Whilst I am a fan of watching anime films in Japanese with the English subtitles, the theatre showing Howl's Moving Castle was only showing it dubbed. I was slightly worried about this, but should not have. Billy Crystal, and Christian Bale in particular,were fantastic. Lauren Bacall's voice and tone perfectly embodied her character's spirit. It is one of the few movies that I have not winced through because of poor voice acting. Howl's Moving Castle is a sensory delight and although many critics have suggested it is not on par with Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, I would have to disagree. I believe it to be right up there.<br/><br/>A most thoroughly enjoyable and amazing movie, for all fans of majestic films."

At the intense war sequence, I found myself so immersed with the movie what my body was leaning towards the movie screen and i was almost falling off my seat! This movie makes you feel like you are inside the hat shop, you are in the wastelands, you are inside howl's castle, you are walking on air, everything that makes the movie special!

","I went into the theatre expecting great things from ""Howl's Moving Castle"" (the English title), being a Miyazaki fan to begin with, but this movie absolutely blew me away! The animation is, as usual, gorgeous; the landscapes are especially beautiful, and few films can compare to the detail of such intricacies as one finds on, say, the castle. But this movie is so much more than pretty graphics-- the plot is interesting, the characters are complex, and the message strikes at the heart of a lot of what is wrong with this world today. A great deal of it has to do with the evils of war, but I especially loved the messages about true beauty and love that this film had to offer. It's been a long time since I've been teary-eyed at the theatre ^.^ Miyazaki also does a great job with the balance between reality, fantasy, and sci-fi, which is always a true pleasure to watch. (I should also probably inform English-speaking fans that the English dub is superb, better by far than most of the abysmal anime dubbing I've heard) I would recommend this film to anyone, whether you're eight or eighty.

","Yes, really - so many people seemed to love Spirited Away yet it didn't engage me whatsoever. However, I found Howls Moving Castle enchanting with some excellent characters and ideas - the animation is beautiful as is the scenery (some of it being classic Miyazaki, ie lush green landscapes, gently drifting clouds and the the sounds of nature). <br/><br/>Without hesitation I'd put Howl above Princess Mononoke, although it's not quite as good as the superlative My Neighbour Totoro and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.<br/><br/>Go see Howl - even if you don't like it as much as Miyazaki's other works then you'll certainly see something thought-provoking and imaginative."
"ChicagoBoy","Null","2","3","11 June 2005"," Its Zen and beautiful
","Hayao Miyazaki does not disappoint us with this visual masterpiece. Howl's Moving Castle is both an opulent feast for the eyes as well as a cleansing tale of good vs evil for the soul. But unlike in JRR Tolkien, where the line between good and bad is thick and easy to discern, in Howl's Moving Castle the good hearted characters can be threatening demons and the forces of ill will can be sympathetic figures of love and woe. It is distinctly non-Christian at it's core. I found this refreshing and frankly more like the inner workings of my own self, where the hero within must find the good and accept the bad in the same grasp. As far as art goes the film is stunning. I missed Miyazaki's wonderful relationship with food that was in Spirited Away (I loved how every character in that film was moved by tiny plates and giant piles of odd looking treats). This was missing in Howl's Moving Castle, replaced more by an obsession with architecture. But Miyazaki's brilliant mix of crumbling rot and bloom flowers was all there. Gorgeous vistas and quaint villages blend together with filth and decay so that they are all beautiful (as does good and evil blend so they are all as they should be). This is not my favorite of his films but it is an absolute must see for anyone who loves moving paintings and fairy tales bordering on the surreal."

They are still advertising it here on TV, and along with the local and international release viewer numbers, the ads now include in big bold letters at the end the U.S. release date of June 10. Ghibli (Miyazaki) fans will of course enjoy this one, but I would recommend it for anyone. It has elements from virtually every movie Ghibli has done thus far, and fans will enjoy noting where they've seen certain themes and characters before. But it has certain qualities all its own. Fans of Diana Wynne Jones book will find that it takes a lot of liberties with the story. Not having read the book, I can't say too much on this, but I think those fans will still enjoy the movie a lot if they go in knowing that it is not a strict interpretation of the book."

She begins a journey of discovery - about herself as much as anything. ""Howl"" - the ultimate free spirit is also facing down demons of his own that he is struggling to reconcile with.

The plot is complex but not at all difficult to follow. The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie.

","The film is named Howl's Moving Castle. It's a Japanese animated film from the year 2004. It was written by Hayao Miyazaki; he also directed the film. The film is based on the novel with the same name, written in 1986 by British author Diana Wynne Jones.<br/><br/>The story is set in a fantasy kingdom with magic and 20th century technology. It tells about a girl named Sophie. She works in a small shop. One day a witch enters the shop and curse her into an old woman. So she escapes from the city ans encounters a wizard named Howl. He has a castle, but it's a very special castle. It has mechanism that lets it wander around, so the location always changes. Together with the wizard Sophie experience exciting adventures. Of course, she hopes that the wizard could disband the curse: that is one of the reasons why she follows the wizard. And at home, no-one would recognize her, or they would have been scared of her and who knows what they would have done to her.<br/><br/>I chose this movie, because it has a deep meaning that gets clear while you're watching the movie. The film shows many facets. It contains strong anti-war themes, influenced by Miyazaki or to be more precise, the whole movie is influenced by Miyazaki's life. In an interview, he explained his love of flying and said that he used to like playing with army planes. But later he also developed a hatred for it. Since these were created to bring destruction. Even that the film is a fantasy story and animated, it is very realistic, except for the magic. Howl's Moving Castle is a very beautiful story that is made for children but also for adults. A perfect film for the whole family."

'Howl's Moving Castle' is so much more than just an animated film. It sends out a powerful message of acceptance, and believing in yourself.

","Hayao Miyazaki is one of the greatest animation directors. Famous for directing the prestigious acclaimed by the Academy: Spirited Away (2003). Through a career that has spanned five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a masterful story teller that usually focuses in strong young girls protagonists. He started his carer in 1963 as an animator and was involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he command attention with his endless ideas for movies<br/><br/>In 2004, Hayao Miyazaki along with Studio Ghibli, released his new project - Howl's Moving Castle. The plot is about a young insecure girl named Sophie who work in her fathers hat shop, different from her sisters. One day she is cursed by a witch who shapes her body as a 90-year-old woman. In order to undo the spell, Sophie run away from home and end finding the castle of wizard Howl Jenkins Pendragon.<br/><br/>I watched this movie a long time ago when I was in my pre-adolescence and I decided to reveal it because every time it's a new experience. What I like about this movie is his simplicity, purity, and a feel of a real world - even if it's a totally fantastic world. It's like if the characters are from one emotion to another and we follow their development as people.<br/><br/>Hayao does very well that very simple structure of his narrative. He knows exactly the right time to apresent each element to us. The moments that needs to be calm, those that needs action and the exciting ones. Also, being based in a book by Diana Wynne Jones we found common elements of fantasy story books. At first, we have the main characters: a girl who will go through a magic adventure and the wizard Howl who, at first, appears as a selfish prince as the ones in a Beauty and the Beast (1991). Then the antagonist who is the evil witch, the secondary characters who have charisma and help the main characters<br/><br/>However, having a lot of subtexts some ideas or messages can be confusing to understood. Like, for example, Howl's relationship with the witch or how Sophie manage to undo her spell over the course of the movie. At the same time Howl is handsome and powerful, he is cowardly and selfish. He is complex and in the movie this may not have been well explained why.<br/><br/>But despite that it is a great animate film. So if you are looking for pictures scenes, dynamic characters and a very complicated character or story driven by plot, you will not necessarily find them here, but you will find this nice and pleasant.

","Hayao Miyazaki's film, Howl's Moving Castle based off Diana Wayne Jones children's book, explores a beautifully animated fantasy world. The hand drawn scenes include everything from ""The Royal City,"" to a never ending flower filled valley, and, of course Howl's Moving Castle. Everything seems to be more exciting or thrilling and the viewer has to keep reminding themselves to pay attention to what is really going on. No one seems to care about the shallow characters or their lack of logical thoughts because the audience is too intrigued by the breath- taking images Miyazaki creates. Sophie, voiced by Emily Mortimer and Jean Simmons, is a young girl who is stuck working in a hat shop during what appears to be an industrial revolution. One day, while on her way to meet her sister, she encounters a problematic situation, but is luckily saved by a wizard named Howl, voiced by Christian Bale, but little does she know, she is actually being brought into an even larger problem. Sophie manages to instantly fall in love with Howl right as he leaves to take on a larger task at hand. Her love for him draws The Witch of the Waste, voiced by Lauren Bacall, to curse Sophie changing her into an old woman, who Howl will not be attracted to. Sophie, distraught that she is an old woman decides to walk up a mountain, because as a fail old woman, that is a great idea. She then seems to encounter all the magic and wizardry that exists even though she has no magical powers herself, first with encountering Howl's Moving Castle, just by accident. Though not much of a castle and there never is an explanation of why it is called a castle, quests occur for not only Howl, but Sophie and the gang of the cursed individuals who just seem to keep appearing. The film contains a mixture of cheesy lines and witty ones, whose only point is to entertain the audience because the characters are not remarkable. At one point, Howl, who is regularly throwing a temper tantrum, states, ""I see no point in living if I can't be beautiful"", and Calcifer, a talking fire, voiced by Billy Crystal, states, ""I can't stand the fire and gunpowder"". Laddie, Sophie's sister who is seen for part of a scene, has no significant value to the structure of the film, but is still put in. No matter what is going on in the film, Sophie's curse of an old woman seems to be the most important issue in the world, I mean it's not like larger issues are going on like a worldwide war. The characters' individuality stops functioning during the film and just seems to go wherever the director puts them, whether it makes sense or not. There are also countless moments where the question ""Why?"" comes to mind. The film is also very vague in describing why a specific scene is occurring, leading to a great deal confusion. There is no doubt that Miyazaki created a beautiful backdrop and characters, but the storyline was no match for the ""scenery porn"". The fact that everything was hand drawn with minimal computer enhancement made you wonder how Miyazaki did it. Drawn to how Miyazaki could continuously to top the images as the film progresses, the storyline just seemed to fade into the background. The only way to improve the film is to remove the characters, even with their witty comments, lack a connection with the audience. In this film, the characters are certainly upstaged by the backdrop. The film definitely has flair with all the beautiful scenes, but lacks something more from the plot. Film directors are pushing their limits with the backgrounds, forgetting to focus on a stimulating storyline."

","Look. I don't care how good the animation is, Howl's Moving Castle was never meant for anime. I loved that book, and it breaks my heart to see Howl and Sophie reincarnated as huge-mouthed, spiky-haired Hauru and Sofi. Howl's castle looks like an evil, potbellied stove on legs. And I'm sorry, but Calcifer is not a friendly little orange glow with big eyes. It's not just the anime, because the humor in the book is fundamentally very dry and British. It's bad enough that some of my other favorite books as a child were ravaged by their remaking (Ella Enchanted, anyone?), but ANIME! Miyazaki should stick to Totoro and Kiki and keep his paws off decent books."

Howl's Moving Castle escalates into randomness sooner than most, making it even worse than normal.<br/><br/>No real themes or profundities (par for the course, again).

","My impressions of Howl's Moving Castle are both positive and negative. On the positive side, it is a gorgeous piece of animation, beautiful from start to finish, and the story is magical, unconventional, and unpredictable. It deserves credit for originality. On the negative side, much of the film makes no sense. The plot moves from one scene to another without demonstrating their relevance to the overarching storyline. The characters' emotions are mystifying and their motivations opaque, so it's difficult to understand why any of them do anything.<br/><br/>Eventually such lack of clarity becomes irritating. About three quarters of the way through the movie I gave up trying to figure out what the point of the story was and stopped caring about the fates of the characters. Thus, for me, the film failed Rule 10 of Mark Twain's Rules of Literary Art: ""the author shall make the reader feel a deep interest in the personages of his tale and in their fate; and that he shall make the reader love the good people in the tale and hate the bad ones."" Sorry, Howl's Moving Castle. You're a pretty flick but I just didn't care about you in the end."

","From Studio Ghibli and director Hayao Miyazaki (Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away), I had seen the DVD cover for this Japanese cartoon film a number of times, and being a fan of the previous films the studio made I had to see it. Basically young Sophie (Emily Mortimer) is the innocent girl who works in her late father's hat shop, and after a chance encounter with the magician Howl (Christian Bale), famous for his moving castle, she is cursed by the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall). The witch turn Sophie into an elderly woman, to become Grandma Sophie (Jean Simmons), and trapped in this body she tries to find a way to reverse it, but more than that to seek her fortune inside the Moving Castle. There she meets and befriends Calcifer (Billy Crystal) the fire demon, he powers the castle and recognises that she is cursed and helps however he can to help her get by. But he also makes a deal with her, if she breaks the contract she is under with Howl, whatever that is, then he has the power to lift her curse and she will go back to her eighteen year old self. I will be honest, this is pretty much the only story I can understand, the rest of it is really complicated, and just see the characters muddling about, helping each other in whatever is going on, and Sophie goes backwards and forwards sometimes with her age state. Also starring Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman, Josh Hutcherson as Markl, Jena Malone as Lettie, Crispin Freeman as Prince Turnip, Mark Silverman as King, Mari Devon as Honey and Liliana Mumy as Madge. I can certainly agree with the critics that the makers seem to have concentrated more on the spectacle than creating a story that you can follow and not get confused with, which is exactly what I found it does, but of course the animation is fantastically imaginative, overall it is not a terrible animated fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Okay!"

But how much did they add to the story?<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I was missing something allegorical in the adaptation. May be I was, but then why take a excellent story and modify it if you want to communicate a personal message.

There were some background scenes (inside the castle) that were painted photo realistically, yet as a viewer, I did not find them jarring with the foreground characters at all. Also, the CGI elements blended in perfectly.<br/><br/>The bad: Plot? What plot? The plot didn't make much sense.<br/><br/>On the whole, the lack of plot didn't effect me much at all because I was too busy putting myself in Sophie's shoes or else ogling at the amazing animation.

Some of the scenes seemed to be updated shots from Laputa. In fact, I had a sneaking suspicion that the two films were set in the same alternative universe. And I wasn't in the least bit surprised when Pazu (from Laputa) made a very brief appearance about 20 minutes into the film.

"lydie-chan-1","6","4","9","13 May 2005"," Admirably Animated but Disappointing in Direction
","I have long been a great fan of Miyazaki. Everything from Mimi wo Sumaseba to Sen to Chihiro (that's Whisper of the Heart and Spirited Away if you speak Disney) have been great treasures of mine since before Disney began their first negotiations.<br/><br/>However, I am disappointed. Jones created a rich and amusing story in the tradition of European faery stories and provided her reader with a well developed plot and wonderful characters. All of these have fallen to pieces in the film. The plot barely resembles Jones's original creation and the characters, who mostly bear the same names, have lost nearly all semblance of their original personalities.<br/><br/>While Miyazaki's world is rich in color and imagination, it is most definitely Miyazaki's world, and hardly Jones's at all.<br/><br/>I am exceedingly glad I saw the movie before reading the book, as I would have been too distracted by the complete deviation from the book to enjoy the wonderful voice acting, art, and music provided by the Japanese crew. (I have no desire to see the film dubbed into English, as screen actors and not voice actors have been cast in the roles.) As is, I am still able to appreciate the very excellent craftsmanship that went into the film. However, those who enjoy Jones's works should be forewarned that this is not the same tale, and one should not expect much to be the same. Had the title and names been changed, one would never have recognized it for the same story.<br/><br/>Aside from the lack of resemblance to the original work, the film was also somewhat confusing, and ended abruptly, as though they ran out of time or paper. And isn't that the same girl from Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke)? What happened to Sophie's red-blonde hair, to say nothing of Martha! Doesn't Michael look a bit young for fifteen? Sophie's entire transformation, both first and last, go almost thoroughly unanswered for. Howl's directness of comment, ""slithering,"" and his penchant for beautiful young girls go quickly by the wayside in adapting him to screen.<br/><br/>However, if you like Miyazaki's works in general and for their own merit, you will probably greatly enjoy Howl's Moving Castle, as I did (before reading the book)."
"qump","3","3","6","29 December 2006"," Movie is pastiche of book, not adaptation.
","Don't fool yourself--Despite sharing a name, the movie is more pastiche then adaptation. I deeply like both Miyazaki and Howl's Moving Castle. I found their combination to be jarring and distressing. If you've read the book, spare yourself and don't see the movie. I expected to see an animated adaption of the book and instead was treated to the disconcerting experience of seeing familiar characters, lines, and places juxtaposed with little or no reference for the original story. Minor points within the book become key to the plot of the movie, and major events/characters in the book fail to appear at all.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is not an especially deep book. It's a fairy-tale about a girl under a spell, and how she saves a wizard from an evil witch (and from himself). It's half a reversed 'Sleeping Beauty' crossed with a marriage comedy. But the movie plays the romantic theme very strongly, and brings in a theme about the how destructive and pointless war is, which was in no way present in the book. It is almost as if the director became disoriented and wrote the second half of the movie as a pastiche of another of Miyazaki's movies, 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', which develops the same theme very strongly.<br/><br/>Watching this movie has really degraded my opinion of Miyazaki. I enjoyed both Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, as well as a variety of Studio Ghibli short films and had a general positive impression of Miyazaki. But as I see more films, I am reminded of H.P. Lovecraft's stories: While Lovecraft wrote well, he only ever wrote one story. Everything he wrote was a variant on that one story. It appears it may be the same for Miyazaki. Each film offers less, because you have, in essence, seen it before."

","It happened with this movie as it happened (to my surprise) with ""My neighbor Totoro"" and other Miyazaki's films. People asking ""why this?"" and ""why that?"". Since when is necessary to have everything explained to you in order to enjoy/understand a film? Films, as many other artistic expressions, work in many levels and cannot (should not) be criticized because a certain criteria is not being followed. Of course, everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but: putting down a film because it doesn't spoon-feed you, the way 90% of US films do nowadays, and dropping it's rate so people might think it isn't a good film (and therefore not watching it) is just plain wrong. Howl's Moving castle is an excellent film. Period. Yes, it is a Japanese film(therefore a ""foreign"" film. LOL). Yes, certain aspects of it (very few really) speak only to the natives. Yes, some matters presented in the film require you to think about them once it is over. But only because the film industry is almost monopolized by US films doesn't mean that we should accept its manufacture as a standard. Let me tell you, I enjoy a good pop-corn movie every once in a while, I really do, but there is so much more going around than that. Please don't scrutinize an art form with such a narrow view.

"diand_","6","3","6","21 August 2005"," War in the Worlds
","Miyazaki creates several worlds in an anti-war tale set in a 19th century small England town in the grip of war. Sophie gets a spell on her by the Witch of the Waste and enters as an old lady Howl's moving castle hoping to make it undone. What follows is an incredible imaginative story where real and fantasy elements mix to create a movie universe where literally anything can happen.<br/><br/>The castle / house has one door that can lead to any of four worlds. One is the ordinary world, where Sophie comes from, to make clear that ordinary people suffer from war as they lead their lives. The second leads to a capital city (London?), where power is exercised and war decisions are made by a king. The king is also under a kind of 'spell' as his power is almost taken over by the witch Madam Sulliman, deciding on war and peace (her loyal dog follows Sophie by the way). The way up to the top is long and steep, as there is also a large distance between ordinary citizens and the king, between not having power and having power.<br/><br/>The third world is the world of magic and fantasy, only entered by Howl through the black state. As there is also war in this world, i.e. between good and bad, this is a mirror of the war in the real world. The last world is of peace and quiet, but only shows landscapes and almost no people in it, it can both stand for a post-apocalyptic world or for heaven. All these worlds and their boundaries are not strictly defined; a certain world often assimilates into any of the other worlds.<br/><br/>As Howl starts winning the peace, Sophie grows younger again, the whole aging process an indication of the suffering of people under war. But Howl pays an increasing high price for his war involvement, as he starts having black feathers. Besides space shifting in the story, time shifting is also used; Howl is at the end under a spell after his battles and only saved much later by Sophie. Calcifer is Howl's heart and soul, therefore almost dead due to his war actions in the fantasy world; even his masterpiece the castle is falling apart as a result of that. The Witch of the Waste meanwhile, is turned into a friendly grandma, indicating she was used by the powers in the fantasy world like a politician or a soldier would be in the real world.<br/><br/>The animation is traditional, as always from Ghibli. Most viewers think computer animation is not used at all here, but there is some limited use. The pacing is somewhat slow, its war story is interesting but not that compelling, so we have to rely on Miyazaki's almost unlimited imagination to keep us involved.<br/><br/>One advice: if you can see this in its original (Japanese) version."

It's simply substandard and inadequate for the depth of feeling in the story. Sorry! After all, I'm the guy who can't watch ""Spiderman"", or ""The Hulk"" or any of the newer films that rely heavily on CGI because it looks so fake and unnatural. The same goes for this film.

"mooooooooo","1","14","52","15 June 2005"," Don't watch it!
","Short answer: It was so far the worst Miyazaki film.<br/><br/>Long Answer: This movie had the most underdeveloped plot and seemed like a quick financial solution to the Studio Ghibli's film, Neko no Ongaeshi, a film about a girl that visited Cat's kingdom and almost turned into a cat herself. This film became a block buster hit in Japan when it came out during Winter break just because of the director's fame. I was greatly disappointed by its corny love story and obvious ending. There were beautiful natural sceneries, as Miyazaki film does, but he stressed too much on romance ever since the ending of Spirited Away. There were repeated scenes from his previous movies, like Flying Castle and especially on Princess Mononoke and seemed a bit repetitious. His theme of flying wizard was probably from his first work of Naussica. What I liked about Miyazaki was not only his art skill, but his way of leaving out the ending for audience to speculate. Well, this movie smacked me right in the face with its obvious ending, and left me greatly disappointed. If he spent on working out a plot a little longer, it could have been better. Since he didn't, not worth watching but just to comment on how bad it was."

","I honestly don't know what the big deal is with Howl's Moving Castle. I just don't understand why everyone's gushing over it. I get the feeling some top reviewer said they thought it was good and everyone else just decided to agree with him/her. I love fantasy movies, I love Studio Ghibli (usually), but this was just taking the mick - great animation ruined by an incoherent story; it just made no sense at all. If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought this was done by Hayao's son - who's take on the Tales of Earthsea was also absolutely horrendous (see my review for that movie), in fact Howl's is just as bad. Studio Ghibli has had some really great hits, but they've also got a good chunk of misfires, and when they do, you really know - you get that sinking feeling, you're bored, you don't know what's going on, and everything seems to happen randomly."
"Samiam3","5","2","4","27 June 2009"," Artistic but too far in the shadows
","Visually strong and inventive, but with incompetent storytelling, Howl's Moving Castle is one of Hayao Miazaki's weaker entries in his otherwise impressive body of work. It is not nearly as heart warming as all his other films. This one is dark, moody, plodding, and contains too much badly scripted dialog. Therefore, I would have to say that Howl's Moving Castle is a disappointment. <br/><br/>Sophie is a harmless young girl, who is cursed by the Witch of Waste with an old woman's body. One day while wandering on her own, she finds a strange mechanical mansion sitting on a hill and when she goes inside, she meets the young magician Howl, who she befriends and ends up traveling with. Along for the ride are Turnip head (a living, but mute scarecrow) and the power ridden Witch of Waste. Sophie slowly learns of Howl's darkest secrets, and finds herself with growing affections for him, despite him trying to keep his distance. she discovers that the boy's soul is ill because he is missing his heart, and she seeks to find it.<br/><br/>Miazaki's creative genius is still strong, no argument there. The world he creates here feels like a combination of glamorous Victorian England and 'The Wizard of Oz', although the setting gets darker as the movie progresses. The story on the other hand is not well crafted. What is meant to be an elaborate story instead becomes complicated, dark and eventually dull. Howl's Moving Castle is neither adventurous nor romantic, and too far from the emotional grasp of the viewers. I don't recommend it."
"Tweekums","9","2","4","9 June 2008"," Another classic from Studio Ghibli
","Once again Hayao Miyazaki has provided us with a beautifully animated film which can be enjoyed by people of most ages; very young children might find one or two scenes a little scary though.<br/><br/>As with all of his films the animation is stunning and the characters are interesting. Once again the main character is a girl, in this case Sophie a young hat maker. One day when she is out she gets slightly harassed by two soldiers but is rescued from this predicament by the wizard Howl who it turns out is fleeing from strange blob-like creatures sent after him by the Witch of the Waste. They escape by flying away from them but soon after the witch visits Sophie in her shop and turns her into an old woman.<br/><br/>After being cursed she heads out in to the wastes where she finds a scarecrow who brings the moving castle of the title to her. The castle is a wonderful creation that is hard to describe, it is a bit like a building that has been constructed by lumping several other buildings together and putting them on legs so it can walk about.<br/><br/>Once inside sits by the fire to get warm and discovers it is no ordinary fire but a fire demon called Calcifer and that it is he who powers the castle after being trapped by Howl in exchange for his heart. Calcifer recognises that Sophie is cursed and offers to beak her spell if she can break his and thus free him.<br/><br/>The castle has a strange door that opens into a variety of places including two cities that are in countries that are at war. In one city they think the wizard Jenkins lives behind the door and in the other they think it is the wizard Pendragon, of course both these are in fact aliases of Howl. Rather awkwardly for Howl both ""Jenkins"" and ""Pendragon"" are summoned by the kings of the respective countries to help with the war effort. Obviously there are plenty more things that happen but I don't want to spoiler the whole film.<br/><br/>Howl isn't the standard cartoon hero, in fact he isn't that heroic at all, he is incredibly vain and he wants nothing to do with the war apart from to end it although he does fight against attacking planes.<br/><br/>As one would expect from Hayao Miyazaki there are plenty of exciting flying scenes involving aircraft that could only work in an animated film. I can't really comment on the English voices as I haven't seen the whole film in English, I did however watch a few scenes out of curiosity and they sounded pretty good."

","Spoiler: Two - points: 1- Mr. Miyazaki's opus is an anti-war rally in guise of this very touching love story. And while I am not necessarily pro-war, I do not like to be preached at. 2-This movie's only true similarity with Diana Wynne Jones' book are the lead character's names.<br/><br/>Despite it being an almost completely different story than the book, this anime film is, nonetheless, (and in my own humble opinion) a work of art.<br/><br/>I watch it as often as I can. It is a truly moving metaphorical film, with a lovely musical score, and surprisingly identifiable characters.

These qualities cause the Scarecrow, Markl, Heen (Sulliman's messenger dog), Howl, and even the Witch of the Waste to respond to her loving kindness by loving her. Howl, who has traded his heart to Calcifer in exchange for power, strives to resist the demands of his King and Madame Sulliman that he fight in their senseless war. Howl dodges their summons by surrounding himself with toys and baubles and swanning around like a rock-star. His salvation occurs when he discovers something worth protecting and fighting for, Sophie and the small family she has gathered about the two of them: Markl,the Scarecrow, Heen, and, yes! even the Witch of the Waste, who, at the climatic moment, resigns Howl's stolen heart into Sophie's hands. In the end even the fire demon Calcifer cannot resist Sophie's love. And so Miyazaki, following his heart, draws good out of evil. What a wonderful story with a truly glorious ending! I love it!"
"The-Hellish-Gnome","10","2","4","6 November 2006"," Different from the book, but in a good way
","Although I haven't seen all his films, I consider myself to be a fan of Hayao Miyazaki. Unlike other Japanese anime directors he doesn't get weighed down in pointless fights and explosions (which the exception of his early film, ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds""). When watching his films you get a feeling of beauty in the artwork that can't be experienced through any other genre of animated films. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is no exception.<br/><br/>Like a lot of Hayao Miyazaki's films, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is lacking somewhat in plot and it is this aspect of his films which causes much distaste among a great deal of Westerners. You can see where they're coming from, things are slow moving, confusing and rarely explained but that's what gives the film its sense of secrecy and mystery. Its sense of magic.<br/><br/>The characters are arguably the best yet providing a believable and indefinable approach to them. They can also be side-splitting; I found myself laughing far more in this film than in any Disney production. Also, as is often a trait with his films, Miyazaki does not create an obvious ""baddie"" but provides us with real characters to whom you can relate to, even if you don't agree with their cause.<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki is at the top of his game. No where else will you find such love and devotion dedicated to all of his films and there is no better film than ""Howl's Moving Castle"" to illustrate that. Some complain about its differences to the book it's based on by Diana Wynne Jones, and yes, it IS very different, but that was the intention. She was recorded to say in an interview: ""It's fantastic. No, I have no inputI write books, not films. Yes it will be different from the bookin fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. It will still be a fantastic film."" I couldn't agree more."

","Well, I saw this movie when it first came out with my current partner, near the beginning of our relationship. So, I'm biased.<br/><br/>Yes, I love this movie.<br/><br/>It's like a more grown-up version of Spirited Away. The characters are rounder and warmer and, if anything, more magical. The magic is richer and cleverer and darker and more compelling. The dream has burst into reality, the magic is not dreamy, but *awake*, wide awake and sizzling with wild delights, in the form of a castle that walks around on chicken legs with a fire-demon at its heart. It's every bit as good, the emotional tones are even more beautiful than in that other masterpiece of the unbridled childish imagination.<br/><br/>My favourite scene is the flashback when Howl watches the falling star people fizzing across the sky to the high, clear, pale blue lake near his little house in the mountains, and catches one and starts talking to it. It lights up his face in the dark...<br/><br/>You either love this sort of thing or you don't.<br/><br/>And, better still, it has a *grown-up* fairy story, the story of a girl who must cast away her self-imposed prison of excessive common sense and dare to dream.<br/><br/>Again the plot is meandering, but it's even less important in this than in Miyazaki's other movies. The last scene is a breath-taking and unashamedly primitive romantic confection. Just like Disney used to be...<br/><br/>10 stars. 100 stars... 1,000 stars..."

Her books always have more than ten things going on at once it seems and everything is always resolved at the end of the book never halfway through.<br/><br/>Anyway....<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Miyazaki's since last year really and fell in love with the movie Spirited Away thankfully TCM played most of his other movies as I am on a somewhat limited budget.<br/><br/>And I'd been a fan of Diana Wynne Jones for a couple of years. When I finally bought the book Howl's Moving Castle it had the promotional cover on it that simply said Now A Major Motion Picture (not with any artwork from the movie on the cover). I had a couple of days of wondering about that. I hadn't heard anything about Howl's Moving Castle being a movie. I thought maybe it was some sort of fluke and the printing press had accidentally gotten my hopes up. <br/><br/>And than by some mysterious force I found out who was doing the movie...Hayao Miyazaki! Imagine my surprise! I was ecstatic.<br/><br/>I love these movies more than the Disney movies I grew up with. My family has been doing art for years (in fact my dad told me that my great-grandfather worked on some backgrounds for Disney back in the day) And we've all been disgusted at the way Disney has become completely CGI and none of the original hand-drawn artwork.<br/><br/>So if you like the book or Hayao Miyazaki or even old time hand-drawn animation this would be the movie for you!"
"GeneR777","10","2","4","30 June 2006"," A Fantastic Film Worth Every Moment
","I have to admit to being swayed by the jacket covers for DVD's and the marketing material used to promote movies. So when I saw Howl's Moving Castle and one of the characters (Howl) as a half-human, half-blue beast, I immediately thought, ""Eww, that's weird. What in the world were they thinking?"" Even though it is by Miyazaki, I have to admit that bias/immaturity on my own part. <br/><br/>So I stayed away from the film for quite some time. (I've also noticed a pattern: I tend to stay away from the best films out there for the most stupid, shallow reasons only to be later blown away by how good they were.) <br/><br/>So eventually I managed to rent this film. I do not even know why it got on my Netflix list. But I saw it. And I was hooked. I watched it once, twice, three times, okay, I stopped at five times because I had to return it or incur the wrath of my girlfriend. But there were several moments throughout the film that really touched me and I was so moved by Emily Mortimer's rendition of Sophie's emotions that it left me perfectly spellbound by the end of the film. <br/><br/>""Okay, I'll just watch one more scene..."" (I also realized you probably can not do this, because pretty soon if you start at any part of the movie chances are you will continue watching until the credits...) <br/><br/>Okay, the review: It's a spellbinding film. A bit unconventional by Western standards, but definitely a movie that takes the audience on an adventure (which is rather refreshing if you consider how many movies promise adventure and give you recycled material today). This film is very endearing as all the characters feel real. Miyazaki excels in creating humorous characters and situations, developing a very warm view of life and everyone in it. The story is sometimes slow, but overall it feels honest and original which is saying a lot in today's cinema. <br/><br/>Definitely worth renting at the DVD store, or, if you can, watching it on the big screen."
"stuartmay","7","2","4","21 March 2006"," good but not great
","My first experience of Miyazaki's work was 'porco rosso / crimson pig' and I still consider that his best movie with Howl's Moving Castle running a some way behind.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle has an opening scene that reminded me of 'porco rosso' (namely the enthusiastic crowds cheering on the military parade). At this stage I was thinking that this would be a collage/mix of his other movies - and indeed most of the characters are drawn in similar style to the 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke' movies.<br/><br/>The plot is good as always (although primary credit must go to the original author). I find the worth of his movies to be in the plots and sub-plots that he puts into them. His movies seem to impart morality much more convincingly than anyone else (disney are you listening). And I agree totally with another reviewer when they said that Miyazaki can masterly blur lines between an enemy and a friend. This is what Disney should try and be like - kids are more sophisticated than we give them credit for and I think this movie can be appreciated by anyone over the age of 5.<br/><br/>I like his level of animation detail too - I tried looking for flaws in the animation but I don't see them - even when someone slams a door in the background you can see things like dust and such moving - and this is just in the background. It's flawless anime.<br/><br/>Anyone who doesn't like 'spirited away' or 'princess mononoke' movies will want to steer clear of this movie - but I found it to be a really good movie and the least you should do if you're a Miyazaki fan is rent it out and see it for yourself - maybe you'll end up buying it too :)"
"SKallas","7","2","4","10 December 2005"," I am one of those disappointed Miyazaki fans
","I think I am one of those stark staring mad Miyazaki lunatics who owns a copy of almost everything he has made... but for me this movie was a disappointment for various reasons that have been already said by many others here. Lack of new ideas (almost every trick, character, face, music passage not to mention a style) and on the other hand lots more of syrup and pathos instead of openness and sincerity. It felt more like a ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" than any of his previous masterpieces - though some have had hints of it here and there. Laputa comes to mind.<br/><br/>Again, as others have mentioned, everything is relative. Regardless of its drawbacks, it is still Miyazaki with most of the greatness this inevitably implies. Disney still can't touch this and it still was great to watch.<br/><br/>It's just... that I will still prefer to watch Totoro or Kiki or Spirited Away all over again instead of this one. These three are and will remain timeless classics for me I guess."
"imcarl","8","2","4","23 June 2005"," Breathtaking like every Miyazaki film-but storyline a bit too much the same
","I think I should say this outright before I get started, Miyazaki cannot top Spirited Away. Orson Welles could not top Citizen Kane. Simply put, some directors make something so good they cannot beat it. So we should not expect too much. Needless to say, this is still Howl's Moving Castle is a very good film. The animation is rich, not quite as much as Spirited Away, but you cannot expect that much from one person. It's just fun to watch.<br/><br/>I guess what hurts this film is that it uses every same plot device Miyazaki has used before. Howl has much in common Haku. The Wicked Witch of the Waste becomes much the same as every other MIyazaki initial villain. Sophie's journey has much in common with Chihiro's or Sen's. In many ways, this repeats a lot from Spirited Away but with too much absurdity and not of charm. The plot and explanations become complex or thrown together. It just doesn't have that usually ingenuity of his other movies.<br/><br/>The entire point of this movie in the end was to take our breathe away with amazing sites. And it did. The animation is better and while it is not as good as his other films, it still is better than a lot of the stuff out there. So if you like Miyazaki or if you just like animation, see this movie. It's worth the five or six bucks. But don't expect a masterpiece like ""Spirited Away."""

","READ THE BOOK, For everyone who doesn't understand what some details are about, just do it. I read it quite awhile ago, and now have seen the film, and its really, very, very, different. But still, all the details are in the book, its very easy to get. Alof of things peaple have said thus far about the movie, much has been written off as the 'subtle miyazaki' creativity, when in reality, it was more along the times of what was happening in the book, rather than how he created it. the details are good, and about the same just, evens happen differently, peaple are together in different ways and so on, between the book and movie, most of the pieces are there, they're just in a different order."
"tommyknockers-1","10","2","4","12 June 2005"," Keep this in mind...
","I loved just about every second of Howl's Moving Castle, but I can understand why some folks had problems with it. <br/><br/>1. Several visual ideas reappear from Miyazaki's other films - blob men, flying machines, laser-pointer crystals, and so forth. Still, nothing feels recycled or rehashed. The referential nods just encourage the notion of a cohesive Miyazaki universe - that all his stories chronicle different periods of a single imaginary world where just about anything is possible. I especially appreciated the Ghibli references since Howl's is rumored to be Miyazaki's final film - this made the experience all the most sentimental and bittersweet, especially when combined with the ""what it means to grow old"" subplot. <br/><br/>If Sophie feels all too familiar to you - consider this: there is an inside joke at Studio Ghibli that a single imaginary anime actress plays all of Miyazaki's different heroines.<br/><br/>While Howl's Moving Castle is certainly not the first Charles-Dickens-high-on-absinthe-and-anachronism anime I've ever seen - its the only one that spiritually takes that Old World European ""turn of the century"" feeling to Sgt.-Pepper's heights. <br/><br/>2. Howl's Moving Castle lacks a traditional narrative plot in favor of presenting a surreal, dream-like experience. The story itself does not suffer from this treatment. It's still a very interesting tale - it just might take some folks a couple of screenings to really get it. The final resolve comes about thanks to a sort-of deux ex machina, followed by some Scooby-Doo worthy revelations. Its a ruthlessly, beautifully, absurdly happy ending that knows very well just how ridiculous it is, and pushes it as far as it can go - but this perfectly follows the film's dream-logic. To claim that Howl's Moving Castle doesn't make a whole lot of sense it to miss the point entirely. <br/><br/>I can't vouch for the book - but unless it was written with Miyazaki in mind - many changes must have been made. <br/><br/>A handful of traditions from other fantasy classics are represented - yet all the while, the film feels totally original.<br/><br/>Its a surreal, dream-like experience - you just have to let yourself go with it. I felt like I was 10 years old again, you get that same overwhelming sense of wonder. In a single word, the film is supremely MAGICAL. Although I'm still in my 20's, the subplot concerning what you lose, and what you gain with old age really got to me. Of course, the visuals are jaw-dropping, esp. the kinetic sense of motion - the way Howl's Castle moves, the way characters' faces morph - its all beyond words. Plus, its hilarious, with a kind of grandparent sense of humor. So many classic moments. And it can be very unsettling at times, esp. during the passages where everything seems too good to be true, we keep waiting for the earth to drop out from underneath. I love the way Miyazaki's heroes accept their doom, and just move on. Its like, ""Hey - what do you know?...I aged 70 years when I woke up this morning, oh well, that sucks, guess I better head off for the mountains."" I feel I should warn you - Sophie's mom comes across like Scarlet O'Hara on bad acid! <br/><br/>I entered the theater expecting to be a little bit disappointed - how could it top Spirited Away? - maybe that's why I was so pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is a perfect Miyazaki movie.<br/><br/>PS - I did eat one brownie, but by Act II, it felt like I head eaten four."
"siderite","9","2","4","9 June 2005"," Great anime, very imaginative
","I enjoyed this movie almost as much as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. You meet here the same magic world, with witchy grannies, courageous boys and girls motivated by love, silly warmongers with their little guns, people turning to demons when they succumb to their evil emotions. Basically you have a world on the brink of technology and also magic, the power of both being controlled by the human heart.<br/><br/>It's a great film to watch, the music is a little to soapy for my taste, the animation great, the characters are interesting, but I couldn't relate to any of them, this maybe being the bad side of the movie (or maybe my bad side :) ), the story is nice and the ending happy. If you are a Miyazaki fan, this is a must for you."
"chubb43","9","2","4","3 April 2005"," Great movie, best watched with friends tho
","The movie is quite frankly, one of the most imaginative, creative movies I've seen this year. The general story is so utterly fantastic that you immediately know that it can't happen in real life. My only complaint is that there are so many times where it justdoesn't make ne sense. At the start of the movie, well, you basically have to take a long time to make sense of everything thats happening, especially since if u don't comprehend Japanese, everything has to be co-ordinated between your reading and watching. The ending really disappointed me, because it basically made so little sense it ruined (to a small extent) the wonderful experience of Howl's moving castle. What do I say? I recommend it to everybody, because it really has a good blend of the ingredients for wide appeal movies. Don't watch ne voice over versions, it completely ruins the delicate balance the movies achieve, especially when one character's lines stretches for 5 seconds after the animation's mouth has stopped moving."
"momoko-3","9","2","4","27 March 2005"," A beautiful love story
","I know I'm going to get slammed by people who love the original book, which this movie is only very loosely based upon, but I have to say it. I like the improvised storyline of the movie that Hayao Miyazaki wrote compared to the original. Yes, the original is funny and upbeat whereas the movie is a little dark. But I don't care. To me, it's a beautiful love story with an anti-war message. I feel Miyazaki san is right to have Sophie as a not-so-pretty girl in the movie rather than somebody lovely like in the book. OK, it makes me feel good that at the end of the day, the kindness of Sophie ie the inner beauty, overcame superficial look. Howl's character in the movie is also more interesting and I thought the the producer made the right choice of having Takuya Kimura to provide the voice-over for Howl's character. It makes him really attractive and fascinating. Somebody wrote that that Howl's character might bring in the female audience like Haku character did in 'Spirited Away'. I must say that person could be right. I was in Kinokuniya a few weeks ago, looking at the Japanese books of Howl. There was this girl with her kid brother also looking at the same books and she commented to him that all her friends like Howl. I thought that was pretty funny considering that Howl is an animated character and not a real person. But Takuya Kimura really breathed life into Howl making him into a sort of devil-may-care, sometime brooding, sometime rascally, good looking wizard who is swoon-worthy, thanks to the animated artists."

","Summary : Hayao Miyazaki backs with another Beautiful Animated Film.
The opening of a film shows very well how the main character character is and how she views life.A storyline that recalls the fusion of horrors of war and the mystical world provides a basis for good story theme.The beautiful world design, the varied character of companion is also very well designed (story and appearance) to give the impression of a strong team bond.<br/><br/>Critics:However As it grew, the plot of the story felt so vague on several sides it could be called a plothole. The explanation of the cause and effect in this film is not well explained,(I did not write it in order to avoid spoilers) .at the end of the film felt like a hasty or forced ending.

","This movie is good to be true. Miyazaki's masterpiece were just best when it comes to this film likelihood. The premises we got in the start and then starts to thrills into the meaning it's just magical. Even if you watch his movie as a kid and the grow up and rewatch it, you'll be surprised by the things and details you've missed. Not to mention, but you'll even get a different sensation and meaning. This movie was the real movie that everyone can watch without a doubt. Kids are truly entertained by the love, character it got and the world where the story begin. But, for adult you'll get thrilled by the details it has and the depth of the meaning. You'll see the characters implement on each other is a very amusing one and it does.<br/><br/>Character
Not every movie has a good character but this one, you'll like every one of them. Miyazaki's film is known to be no pure evil antagonist character that usually just beat the things of the protagonist character frontally. Instead, He creates their own background. Everyone has their own motives and they interact each other well.<br/><br/>Story
Ah, Miyazaki stories are just amazing. His story do well always has a good meaning and yeah it's message about love, bond, peace and life meaning always delivered very touching. Even i always carried away by his imagination implemented on every film. But, the best of the story in Miyazaki's film was the little details impact huge in the story.<br/><br/>Soundtrack
Can't say no more. When i watch it, i feel like i'm in an opera with those best players from all over the world plays together."

"zelawrewind","7","0","0","4 May 2020"," Perfect for art, but plot on the other hand...
","This is the second time i watched this movie. The last time I watched it was when I was much younger, where I obviously didn't really understand much. Ten years later, I realize I still don't really understand the plot, especially around the last 30-40min of the film.<br/><br/>To be honest, the universe in which the story is set in is definitely interesting. It's hard to get tired of the magic universe in the end. However, I felt like this film fell short of its potential.<br/><br/>1. Loose climax with minimal explanation
In a 2 hour movie, too much time was spent building on a ""climax"", which was in the end rushed through with minimal explanation within the last 30 min. To be fair, the first half of the movie is really well done in the sense that it brought me into the world of the magical elements as well as the characters. However, this perfect sense of momentum and detail building built me to expect more from the what is to come - an exciting climax, a good explanation for everything that has happened, an adversity overcome and a happy ending. Of the four mentioned which I expected, the first two were not really there. The climax was apparent, but not exciting enough simply because it lost me in terms of its story. I spent more time being confused and annoyed at ""huh, so what's going on?"" and ""why did Sophie do that?"" when it was a period I should be most absorbed into the story. Explanation for why Howl looked the way he did like a bird; what Howl has been doing flying around so often and getting hurt; why Howl swallowed the fire when he was young, why the war was on-going (all was described was that it was ""foolish""), why the war could end so easily in the end, etc ... pretty much left unexplained. I am honestly, truthfully, glad that Howl and Sophie got their happy ending (they deserve it), but I have to admit that the story left a mild bitter taste for me after I finished the film. After so much hardship for the characters, I felt like there wasn't a good enough closure for their story. I could have been happier for the first couple that ""officially"" ended up together, among the many movies I have watched of this animator - if I didn't felt like there's something missing to the story and their love as well.<br/><br/>2. Sophie
Okay, I was initially impressed at the female protagonist at the first half of the film... She was brave and optimistic despite the curse placed on her. Going beyond the first half though, I got annoyed at her character. The story tries to portray her as nice and kind, but I wonder why then, does she seem to treat Califer so badly? Califer kept telling her that he will go out if there's water, but she kept openly ignoring that. Near the end, when she tried to rebuilt the castle, she even brought Califer out into a rain without even a shelter for the poor fire despite wanting Califer to work hard to rebuild the castle. ??? It hardly made sense right. She could at least bring another pan to cover the poor fire... Then, she went on to dump water on Califer even AFTER she heard that it was Howl's heart inside Califer. I understand she is trying to save the witch, but really?? After claiming that she love Howl, her first instinct is to ignore that her action is about to kill Howl off, in order to save a witch who cursed her? I was about to bash her (and the witch obviously) after that scene. I feel like her character isn't portrayed very well in this sense. To me, several of her actions portray her differently from the image the story tried to build her as.<br/><br/>Well okay, the two points above are my main put-offs for the movie. The ending, while a tad cliche, wasn't that bad if I just pretend that everything that needs to be explained has been explained. At least Howl and Sophie ended up together in a happy ending.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this is a movie worth watching if you like beautiful art and fantasy/magic alternate universe. Try not to expect too much of the plot (even if the story seems to build up an expectation right until near the end - when you finally realize it's not gonna meet it) and it's still a good watch. Howl's drawn so suave and beautifully may I say :P"
"krational66","9","0","0","3 May 2020"," Love + courage=magic
","Love at first sight and love slowly<br/><br/>It was clear that Sophie had fallen in love with Hal at first sight: from the time he put his arm around her to rescue her, to the time he took her for a walk in the air, to the time she talked absentmindedly to her sister, to the time she drove home and stared into the distance, it was a sign that she was secretly in love with Hal. In fact, for the life of the ordinary Sophie, how to refuse the magnificent as a prince Hal? (smile)<br/><br/>On the other hand, Hal's good looks are definitely not lacking for girls, but it is Sophie who can finally understand Hal's weakness and give him courage and support. So Sophie gradually wins Hal's love in her relationship with him.<br/><br/>2. Sophie's transformation<br/><br/>For Sophie, who had been dressing in grey and blue for years and making hats in front of the window, duty and obedience were the themes of her life, a life that hid her inner glory and made her live like a grey mouse, looking in the mirror and desponding even herself.<br/><br/>The situation is broken when Sophie is turned into a 90-year-old woman by the badlands witch. Because Sophie could no longer stay in the hat shop, she finally had a reason to escape from the arrangement of life. Sophie said: the good thing about being old is that you have nothing to fear and nothing to worry about losing.
I prefer Sophie as she grows older, because Sophie's mother-in-law is lovely, has a personality, aggressive, and compassionate.<br/><br/>In one scene, Hal throws a tantrum over dyeing his hair. 'what's the point of being alive if you're not pretty,' he says. Sophie was angry: I've never been pretty! Then he went out the door and cried. It's an amazing transformation: as soon as Sophie becomes a mother-in-law, her previously repressed inner feelings begin to release and her bright spots come out.<br/><br/>The opposite lover<br/><br/>Sophie represents the person who has no outward appearance but an inner abundance. (a mother-in-law's appearance is bad enough, but the clean crazy witch is actually pretty cute.) Hal, on the other hand, represents a man who looks gorgeous but feels empty and timid. It was dramatic that the two men fell in love.<br/><br/>Love is growing up together<br/><br/>Sophie and Hal turned out to be evasive people. Hal avoids facing his inner weakness, while Sophie avoids fighting for her right to live. The witch's persecution of the wasteland brought them together and gave them courage and hope for love. Finally, Sophie no longer felt inferior, and Hal no longer covered his heart with vanity.<br/><br/>5, magic,<br/><br/>Miyazaki hayao like magic, as big friends keyang like machinery. The person who loves magic represents a state of being: a strong desire to achieve the dream of the heart. Because magic means strong faith. And love is the catalyst to activate this belief.<br/><br/>6. The world is one<br/><br/>In the original, the conflict between people is obvious, and the wasteland witch finally gets the destruction. And in the movie, there are no really hateful characters. Saliman, the wasteland witch, as the villain, also has a kind and lovely place. This shows that miyazaki hayao's world view is getting wider and wider. There is no absolute good or bad in the world.<br/><br/>Hal's moving castle is easy in general. And plain truth is always in simplicity. I think miyazaki has returned to his roots. Life, itself is used to romance."

Magic and sorcery is common in this world, but everything surrounding Howl and his castle is a mistery. The way the movie makes us learn and adapt to this world on excactly the same pase as Sophie makes this movie incredibly immersive. When the movie comes to an end, it almost feels like you've actually been a part of this world for weeks. The story gets darker and darker the more you watch it, but ends with just enough wonder to leave you statisfied, that tiny bit of light in the form of Howl's heart. My only issue is that some parts of the magic and curses are not really explained well, but that isn't really that neccesary to the story, and can therefore easily be overlooked. If you are even slightly interested in anything Studio Ghibly has to offer, this will be a movie for you."

","Second film I see from Studio Ghibli and I am surprised again. I found the story a little slow and very monotonous, but that doesn't mean it ruined my experience with the film. The film, visually, is so full of details that it made my eyes shine because of the beauty of the lines that were on the screen in front of me. The landscapes, the castle moving, the protagonist's dress and her hair. And one of my favorite scenes is breakfast. (How could a movie have made me feel hungry?). The characters are very charismatic and well built. Calcifer is a very comical character with very few scenes, but he does not lose his importance in the story. What to talk about Howl? He is a very important character too and we see a little bit about his personality before becoming attached to the protagonist, and his personality after her. Rather ambitious and narcissistic to become someone who cares about others. Then we have our protagonist named Sofia. She is humble and sweet, but she has, between the lines, a low self-esteem that is almost invisible. He is naturally a person who would help anyone, even if they were your enemy. She is a very realistic character, in which she treats her problems with caution and with her heart. Once again Studio Ghibli shows once again that it does not feel obliged to provide details about the world of its film. He just wants us to follow the growth of all the characters. In the end that's just what will matter."

","The word that popped into my head to best describe this film was 'charming'. I've never considered a movie charming before, so I'd have to say this one had an impact on me. The story was a uniquely creative one and the animation art wasn't as off-putting as some anime can be.<br/><br/>As Sophie went through her various age related metamorphisms, I tried to keep track to see if there was a common denominator for becoming young again after the Witch of the Waste cast her spell. It occurred when she fell asleep, but after that it was hard to distinguish any common elements responsible for the change. Maybe it was an aspect of her mood at the time? <br/><br/>I have to admit, there were times in the second half of the story when things were getting a bit difficult to follow, where cause and effect didn't seem to have any connection to each other. The one thing that occurred in the story that caused some concern was when Sophie threw the bucket of water on the old Witch, summoning up a reference to Dorothy defeating the Wicked Witch of the West. That coincidence I think detracted from the story's originality a bit.<br/><br/>But otherwise I came away feeling good about the picture. I've seen a few other works by director Miyazaki, among them ""Princess Mononoke"". That one too was somewhat complex in trying to understand and I don't pretend to 'get' all of what he was trying to say, but he makes up for it to large degree with interesting characters and a very nice palette that's pleasing to the eye. I just recently happened to view the movie that beat this one out for Best Animated Feature, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"", and for my money, this one appealed to me a whole lot better."

Although Calcifer is fantastic. I hated the rest of the characters. The witch of the waste is dreadful, she's disgusting, and okay I understand that she's not meant to be liked but they made her repulsive. It misses out crucial plot points in the book. It's difficult enough to understand if you have read the book.

I left the theater disgusted that i paid ten dollars for this movie.<br/><br/>The carefully sculpted plot of the book is ripped away. Replacing it is a mediocre mixture of Mononoke, Spirited away, and a bit of Nausicca. The ending, specifically really stupefied me. I didn't see any morals, or anything i could relate to. The revelation of Howl as a giant bird completely threw me. I seriously caution all DWJ fans to NOT see this movie. If you want to see a good adaption of a book, save yourself some money, and don't go. Only if you want to see a movie that looks like Miyazaki was being completely unoriginal, but with really awesome animation, should you go."

","The animation is fine, the music is fine, but all in all this movie is simply a confused mess with no coherent plot.<br/><br/>You could've almost assembled the plot (such as it was) by drawing random elements out of a hat. In fact, I almost wonder if that's how it was all put together.<br/><br/>The one thing that I find really interesting is that you can take something which barely makes any sense at all and have it hailed as genius. I suppose that's because it's different from most other films. Well, it certainly is that.<br/><br/>Oh, and be sure to throw in a bit of an anti-war theme. It doesn't matter whether the war planes are ours or theirs, we're all morally equivalent here. No matter what our reasons for defending ourselves might be, we're automatically as evil as those who attack us.<br/><br/>Someone else commented that this film was ""art."" Well, it depends what kind of art. There is currently a movement that has begun to recognize that all of the feathers glued onto steel girders painted blue (and similar works of the 20th century) were just... feathers glued onto steel girders painted blue.<br/><br/>Just because something is different doesn't make it brilliant.<br/><br/>To be fair, Howl's Moving Castle wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. Some kids will like it. For the animation and music, I give it about a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>(And by the way, I don't know how people can find this comment not to be helpful. It's my honest opinion of the movie, and in my personal opinion it's an accurate view. The movie is simply rather incoherent. If you like incoherence in your movies, fine. I don't. On the other hand, my young teenage daughter liked it because ""it had a strange plot line."" My preteen daughter thought it was ""fantastic.""

"KADC","8","3","11","29 September 2005"," Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli fail to live up to their otherwise well deserved reputation.
","Nausicaä, Laputa, My Neighbour Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoké, Spirited Away... each of these films raised the bar for both the quality of art and story telling we expect when Studio Ghibli produces an animé directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Unfortunately, Howl's Moving Castle is not the shining example of Ghibli's/Miyazaki's best work.<br/><br/>The art, often reminiscent of Nausicaä, might have been considered stunning several years ago, but having been spoiled by visual masterpieces like Princess Mononoké and Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle simply fails to impress and often seems dated, both in terms of character drawing and background art. True, there are moments of artistic brilliance; however, the competent but ultimately uninspired body of this picture's artwork overshadows these moments. Perhaps Howl's worst failing is the unacceptably unrealistic rendering of the ""old"" main character.<br/><br/>As is often the case in movies originating in Japan, character motivation tends not to be explored and may seem confusingly unclear at times. Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki have consistently overcome this stereotype with well-defined scripts and superior direction in their previous films; yet in Howl's they take a step backwards and often leave the audience scratching our heads wondering why the characters are behaving the way they do.<br/><br/>The sound effects, music, and voice acting are all well done -- with one glaring exception: Billy Crystal's performance as the fire demon Calcifer. Try to imagine Billy Crystal's brilliant performance as Miracle Max in The Princess Bride. Now take away the sarcasm and anger, and what you are left with is the almost emotionally dead portrayal of what otherwise could have been a very entertaining character. Why either Rick Dempsey or Peter Docter, who are both experienced voice directors, chose to allow this is truly puzzling.<br/><br/>Overall, Howl's Moving Castle is an enjoyable enough movie, particularly for children who may not notice it's many flaws. However, animé fans have come to expect much more from Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki and are bound to be disappointed."

","Howl's Moving Castle ranks with some of the finest works Hiayao Miyazaki has done, and that's saying quite a bit because the man has some seriously fantastic films under his belt, almost anything he touches is gold. The astounding animation fully brings to life the booming steampunk world that the director as created, from the smoggy Victorian streets, to the steam powered vehicles roaming the city, it's extremely aesthetically pleasing. It's themes are often light enough for children to enjoy but it does delve into some darker themes that will appeal to older viewers, and the entertainment factor is for all ages, it's a truly magical story with a great message, albeit with a rather overly mushy and sappy ending. Characters have always been a strong suit for the auteur, and while there are some similarities with these characters from other Miyazaki films, they still have their own personality and are never a clear copy of past characters, each bringing their own insight and humor to the story, they just follow a similar formula that strays away from being too familiar adding new set pieces (this one is action packed), twists and elements to make this a wholly original watch."
"iguth","10","1","2","27 April 2019"," Magical!
","This movie is gorgeous, even for a Ghibli film. The characters are awesome the mysterious nature of Howl works throughout the movie and Calcifer is super entertaining. The plot is complex but not at all difficult to follow. The world built is the best world built in a Ghibli movie and it may have something to do with the moments when characters are not advancing the plot and just interacting in the world. There is a very smooth transition from the early mystical aspect of the movie to the more intimate ending of the movie. The plot, while there, is not very important to the story. The characters do not usually act as if they have a goal in mind but instead are wandering in a direction that is the end of the movie. Lastly the name is fitting to the movie, I love how much of a role the castle itself plays in the film. It always seems to be interesting in every scene and frequently reveal something new about itself."

","I'm a great fan of Miyazaki's movies. I really wanted to have loved this, I really wanted to. But I couldn't. The animation it´s high quality, as you would expect from Miyazaki movie: It's beautiful, criative, rich in detail and very well built. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same of the characters, which are not so memorable and fun. Here we don't have anthological creatures like Totoro or No-Face, nor do we have such charismatic characters like Mononoke, Chihiro, Haku, Lupin III, Nausicaa, Porco Rosso. The plot is confusing, tiring and boring. Miyazaki movies usually have crazy twists and crazy situations, but the Howl's Moving Castle is just too confusing in excess. The beginning, when Sophie is a young woman, is spectacular, but then the story becomes a mess as it moves on - the idea was good, but it was not well executed. THMC has probably the most beautiful sceneries I've ever seen in a Miyazaki movie, but in term of character, soul, life, story, plot, it falls far short of such classics as Spirited Away, The Castle of Cagliostro and Princess Mononoke."

"ElMaruecan82","6","1","2","22 December 2017"," However painful it is to write this, but this time, Miyazaki indulged to self grandiosity...
","I'm glad that Hayao Miyazaki reconsidered his decision to retire otherwise his 2004 ""Howl's Moving Castle"" would be his last movie I'd experience and well, you got it, it wasn't as pleasant as the previous ones. I watched it three times, as I used to because his movies tend to be rich content and form wise so the two aspects can distract one from another, but then checking some other users' comments, I stuck to my initial reaction: the animation is as great as you can expect from the master but it's one of these cases where, paraphrasing Emperor Joseph from ""Amadeus"", you can just sigh and say there are simply too many 'notes'.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's not a case of Emperor with no clothes, but with so many clothes you can't even recognize him anymore. But I had my reservations from the beginning because the title reminded me of ""Castle in the Sky"" and that film didn't leave me ecstatic either, an action-packed coming-of-age story, puppy romance with environmentalist and anti-war messages venturing in the realm of magic led to a real overdose of effects not easily 'digestible' by a younger audience. The film is still just a lighter version of ""Howl's Moving Castle"", a real 'fantasy' bouillabaisse and perhaps the unique instance where a point came I stopped to care about the film and was waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>Was it because Miyazaki was so intoxicated by the universal (and deserved) acclaim of ""Chihiro's Travel"" that he felt he could fly that close to the sun and get away with it, there was just something a tad pretentious in that late-minute eruption of fantasy and witchcraft. And yet it started so promisingly<br/><br/>I just loved the quiet beginning in that small European town, I figured the action took place during World War I, then it started with a meek and mousy milliner named Sophie who's saved from two bullying soldiers by a handsome flying 'angel' named Hauru (the titular Howl) and then you have your set-up for a typical Miyazaki journey, a young female candidate for a great coming-of-age story, flying, magic and war as the backdrop. Then the troubles begin: a cruel sorceress named the Witch of the Waste turns Sophie (for no apparent reason) into an old woman and not only we've had to say goodbye to the pleasant look of Sophie to (yet another) ugly looking grandmother. What's with Miyazaki and old women anyway?<br/><br/>Still, the real problem is that the personality of Sophie changes as well, in fact, it changes so radically that she becomes like another character. This might be the most disturbing thing about the film, all through her adventure; the changes in Sophie's looks and personality are so inconsistent that I had a hard time detecting the aspect of her personality that was meant to evolve. I initially thought being an old woman would help her to embrace life with more enthusiasm, but she seemed to have understood it very quickly and become your typical domineering lady as soon as she enters the castle (with the help of the turnip-face scarecrow). So what was Sophie's lesson to learn? <br/><br/>From the ending, we gather that ""Howl's Moving Castle"" was meant to end like a love story. I didn't read the original novel from Diana Wynne Jones (in fact, when I heard the name ""Witch of the Waste and saw the scarecrow, I expected a 'Wizard of Oz' like journey) but even in the novel, I guess there was an arc to close, but here, Sophie falls in love with Howl or Hauru, why? She did save him in a way but since she spent most of her time as an old lady trying to break her spell, she acted more as a motherly figure helping an insecure kid, those were interesting twists on the usual characterization, but at the end it seems that there's a return to a basic narrative that didn't match the beginning.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed the film say after the visit to the Queen and then, the overuse of magic and ominous malevolent spirits, then the chants and the chases and I just stared at the screen and thought ""boy, that escalated quickly"". The problem with magic is that it's a double-edged sword, basically when the main protagonist is victim of a curse, her 'love' interest is a wizard, the nemesis turned protagonist is a witch, and the wise queen an even crueler witch, and the castle is a magic spirit moved by a talking fire, well, there are so many possibilities there's no savor to unpredictability anymore, it becomes boring. The movie goes in too many directions and magic shortcuts itself in a chaotic extravaganza. Kiki's incapability to fly the broom was more intense than anything from ""Howl's"" climax.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is visually pleasant but at some point but so are many Terry Gilliam's movies and they're not in the same league of greatness. At least, ""Castle in the Sky"" had the pirates and couldn't be a love story anyway, while ""Howl's Moving Castle"" seems to cut-and-paste all the usual elements of Miyazaki and provide a great entertainment without any 'ubstance', the ingredients are all there but making a film is also like making a good cake. Miyazaki did this film like the pastry cook who's just finished his cake, added some Chantilly cream, then some fruits, then some raspberry coulis, and then some walnuts... individually, they all taste great but in the same recipe, they can only contribute to something indigestible.<br/><br/>While not a bad movie or a misfire, I think this is just Miyazaki being carried away at the most pivotal moment of the film and realizing at the last minute that it should have a proper ending. Definitely a case where the best was the enemy of the good."

"tdeskew","10","1","2","7 December 2016"," One of Hayao Miyazaki's most structured and intriguing films
","Howl's Moving Castle is a 2004 film directed by one of my favorite film- makers, Hayao Miyazaki. The movie is based on a series of books by Diana Wynee Jones. The use of romance and sacrifices made for each other to help rise each other to the top while working together makes the film very delightful and enjoyable to experience. There are many friendship and teamwork lessons within the film which makes it great for audiences of any age. The magic and fairy tale like theme makes it spectacular watching the use of good and evil contradict each other but you eventually realize that each character has a justified reason to their actions which ends in delight for even the not so good characters in the film. Everyone deserves a happily ever after and Hayao Miyazaki shows that well in this piece.<br/><br/>Insecurity is a large influence in this film. Sophie, a hat maker who works in her father's shop, is practically saved by Howl and literally swept off her feet from perverted officers while walking to her sister's bakery and that is when her life is changed forever. Howl is a wizard with a moving castle that he uses to flee from the dangers of his magic powers. Sophie is eventually cursed by the Witch of the Waste since she was seen with Howl and turned into an old woman. The catch to the curse is, she is not allowed to talk about what has happened to her. This reaches out to audiences and allows them to relate to Sophie's insecurities with how accepting she is to being an old woman. She eventually sets off on her own adventure to figure out how to reverse the curse which leads up to magical experiences and teamwork with involvements of romance and friendship.<br/><br/>Despite Sophie's low self confidence, she put on a brave face and made it to an empty land where she befriends a scarecrow which leads her to Howl's castle that she uses for shelter for the majority of her adventure. The fire that keeps the castle moving is a demon called Calcifer who is under a curse which keeps him stuck as being nothing but a fire. Also living in the castle is a young wizard in training called Markl. Sophie, Howl, Calcifer and Markl all support and make sure each other are safe and secure. Howl was a coward but with the help of his friends he becomes one of the strongest happiest wizards in the land. <br/><br/>Disaster strikes when Howl is called to war. The spinning dial at the front door is a portal to different parts of the land. Sophie poses as Howl's mother and is accompanied by the Witch of the Waste and a dog to Madame Sullivan's castle, who is the ruler. The Witch of the Waste is stripped of her powers while Sophie explains how Howl is not able to fight his battles. Once Madame Sullivan angers Sophie, Howl must come to the rescue to escape back to home when they are joined by the Witch of the Waste and the ruler's dog. This part demonstrates strength, Sophie originally went to the castle to explain Howl's failures but then allows Howl to gain courage and save the love of his life. From this point forward, Howl is portrayed as a hero and a fighter. He goes through weakening battles during the war to protect his true love, Sophie, and to help defend his land. Miyazaki demonstrates character development in many ways starting with Howl's bravery. In addition, the deeper Howl and Sophie fall in love the more Sophie is able to embrace herself and reverse the curse on her own. You notice throughout the film sometimes Sophie looks younger than other times and those are the moments when she is feeling confident. The more that goes wrong, the more Sophie is able to allow her strengths to shine and she becomes a more secure person. As you can see, I am amazed by the story line leading up to Sophie's confidence rising. The Witch of the Waste follows this pattern when she discovers Calcifer holds Howl's heart within his flames. She grabs the heart which results in disaster for everybody, but when the situation becomes more content, Sophie persuades her to give the heart back and save Howl's life. The use of examples of growing from your troublesome experiences makes it an eye opener to audiences to realize that when life gets rough, you can always find a way to prevail. <br/><br/>The life lessons in this film are outstandingly portrayed by the producer. He never fails to provide a strong female role in his films which implies self confidence and examples of leadership for girls everywhere. Sophie may seem stronger than Howl in the beginning of the movie, but by the end they balance out each other's strengths and weaknesses to make a great team. Friendship is a major component in this movie. Calcifer is set free of his curse but returns to his friends as the free spirit he is. In addition, the scarecrow saved the crew from falling like an avalanche from the top of a mountain once Calcifer's spirit is freed, but once Sophie kisses him on the cheek, his curse is reversed showing that she is his true love. He is very accepting to the fact that Sophie loves someone else and just wants to do the best for his people by attempting to put an end to the war. The ending is well for everyone, even Madame Sullivan! When the dog somehow checks in with her through a crystal ball, she decides to put an end to the war due to seeing Howl using the potential of his powers and finding his true love. In Miyazaki's movies, he uses his knowledge of every soul developing so they deserve their happily ever after no matter how cold they may seem."

","Sophie is a young shy hat maker working for her mother in an alternate-world turn-of-the-century European town. A wizard named Howl rescues her from a couple of lascivious soldiers only to be chased by a horde of waste demons. They escape to her sister Lettie's place. She is later visited by the Witch of the Waste and turned into an old woman. She runs away and encounters scarecrow Turnip-Head. After helping it, it leads her to Howl's Moving Castle. There she encounters the fire demon Calcifer who Howl uses to power the castle. Calcifer offers to break her curse if she could end his servitude. Sophie pretends to be new cleaning lady Grandma Sophie. The Mayor arrives at the Great Wizard Jenkins with a request from the King to fight in the war. Howl's apprentice Markl is able to switch between various exits and with various disguises. Then the other king invites Great Wizard Pendragon to join in the war. Howl is known as both wizards and unwilling to help either side. Madame Suliman threatens to take away his powers before he is lost after losing his heart.<br/><br/>This is an interesting world. The start sets up an easy fantasy with an evil witch and a haunted hero. The twist is the heroine gets turned into an old hag. About midway, the movie takes an odd turn that deviates from that easy formula. The evil witch becomes powerless. There is a new villain but she's not really a villain. This is an anti-war movie but it isn't so straight forward. Even the simple love story gets a last-minute true love detour. While the world is amazing, the story seems to delight in odd diversions from the formula."

Watching this a number of times help to digestion and give new a way of appreciating and messages. <br/><br/>I like this movie the best in Ghibli works. First, Howl is so cool in that both appearance and inside. His personality is conceited but weakling. Though he looks sorry on the face of it, these bring his gentility and strength, I think. No matter how many times I watch is, I enjoy Howl's attraction and I think real theme of the movie."

","First kiss, new boyfriend/girlfriend, sex, and heartbreak: The unoriginal portrayal of romance in every popular TV series and chart-topping movie since who knows when. Some people enjoy that, I'm not going to lie, but when something as commonly accepted as those steps to love are practically nonexistent in a romance--and this movie is impeccable--it has to be worth checking out. <br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle (animated fantasy/drama film) is just another masterpiece of Studio Ghibli's, yet I'm sure you've never heard of the film or the book in which it was based off of. It can be a little hard to grasp the unique flavor at first; after all, this was originally produced as a Japanese film. <br/><br/>In brief, it's about family. From the sounds of it, Sophie didn't have the most together birth family, but the one she managed to fall into with Howl and Markel made up for it tenfold. It's the people you love that bring out the best in you. Howl shows Sophie how courageous and beautiful she always has been, and in turn, Sophie proves to him that he isn't the cowardly monster he believes he's become. Spells, nor our past can control who we chose to become.

","Another great movie from a great director - Hayao Miyazaki. In his usual aesthetically pleasing fashion, he conjures a fantasy realm beyond the viewer's wildest beliefs, and he somehow manages to shoehorn this majesty onto a single DVD! I liked the chemistry between Howl and Sophie, which is one of the central elements to this story; at first, Howl is fussy about his appearance, and he makes Sophie cry when they have the argument. Eventually, though, Howl learns to cope with his altered appearance, and he and Sophie develop a relationship with each other. It is a storyline that is almost like Beauty and the Beast in a sense; in both instances, you have the man in the relationship who has been ""dehumanized"" or turned into a monster, while you have the woman who wants to bring out the man trapped inside the monster. Some of the other characters, like Calcifer and Turnip Head, provide plenty of comic relief in this film, which further helps to engage the viewer. A must-see for any fan of animation, Hayao Miyazaki, fantasy, steampunk, or anyone who is a fan of great cinema."
"nooranmazen","10","1","2","31 March 2015"," Beautifully created movie which touched my heart
","Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from the famous book written by author Diana Jones, is perhaps the most creative,magical, and heartwarming Japanese animated movie to be produced by the legendary Ghibli studios. Director Hayao Miyazaki, who is famous for his other internationally popular works, such as My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away, enchants his viewers once again with Howl's Moving Castle, which was released in 2004. The movie has appeared on many critics' top lists and received high ratings and much praise.<br/><br/>Sophie, a quiet and plain looking girl who works in her family's hat shop, is cursed by an evil witch, called ""The Witch of the Waste."" The curse transforms her into an old woman. Sophie runs away and goes to work for the wizard Howl in his castle, hoping he can reverse the curse. She falls in love with Howl, who is mysterious and charming. She tries to free Howl of the dangerous deal he made with his fire demon, and he tries to break her curse. But they have a larger problem, there is a coming war.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's animations are highly imaginative and creative, and truly a treat to see. He creates beautiful yet magical worlds, and as a viewer, I found myself wanting to live in the amazing world of Miyazaki's unique imagination. His landscapes and settings are very beautiful and full of detail. His creations of the war-crafts, and especially of Howl's very unusual walking castle, are awe inspiring.The music used in the film is excellent and sets the mood for many of the scenes during the movie. The soundtrack is all comprised of wonderful and emotional orchestra pieces.<br/><br/>Miyazaki's character adaptations are exceptional. His characters are dramatic, comical, and flamboyant, while remaining relatable to the audience. He creates some very wild, theatrical characters, such as the evil witch of the waste and Calcifer, the Fire Demon, but balances them out with sensible, realistic characters such as Sophie and Howl's apprentice, Markl. However, what really makes the characters spectacular are the actors which play their voices. There are a number of very skilled actors, such as Christian Bale, Jean Simmons, and Billy Crystal, which bring the characters to life. The voice actors do an excellent job of interpreting the deep emotions and feeling of the character's into their voices, and conveying the emotions to the audience. You can feel the love, anger, bitterness, frustration, and joy that the characters are feeling throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie, Howl's Moving Castle contains several important themes which interest a wide variety of audiences. Some of the main themes include : family, love, destiny, appearances, deceptions, evil, and the supernatural. I found all these themes portrayed clearly in the story and, they gave the plot real significance and deeper meaning. You can learn some very important lessons from the movie, such as the importance of family and love, the consequence of deception and evil, and that your fate and destiny are always in your hands.<br/><br/>This a truly amazing film that I have watched many times and it touches my heart every time. I truly enjoyed every single aspect of this magical, creative, and beautifully done movie. I recommend this movie to everyone, because this movie has something for everyone to enjoy."
"liamgoose","10","1","2","23 February 2014"," Yet another breathtaking film from Miyazaki!
","This movie is breathtaking! One of Miyazaki's best films ever (almost on par with Spirited Away which is my favorite anime film ever, and on par with Kiki's Delivery Service which is my second favorite Miyazaki film). The animation is stunning. Everything including the decor of the homes, the people and buildings in the cities, and characters especially are are guilty of taking your imagination and letting it run wild while you watch this film. The attention that Hayao Miyazaki put into Howl and Sophie with their personalities and flaw are very compelling, especially Howl. He is one of my favorite male characters from Miyazaki's work (I also really like Haku from Spirited Away they are both very relatable). Sophie is also one of my favorite female characters from Miyazaki's work as well (I have a huge crush on her, but I pretty much have one on all of the other female characters from Miyazaki's work, except the sisters from My Neighbor Totoro. I didn't really like that film). Overall this film is amazing. Practically perfect! I would give it a 12, but alas I can't. Here is my complete list of top Anime films of all time. http://www.imdb.com/list/G7lvVZJ1qJ0/"
"tieman64","Null","1","2","16 January 2014"," Sophie, are we a family?
","Hayao Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle"" revolves around Sophie, an insecure young woman who is transformed into an old lady by a spiteful witch. An outcast before her transformation, Sophie takes to her new body like a fish to water; she leaves her bustling town for the anonymity of life in the mountains. Here she gets a job working for Howl, a powerful wizard.<br/><br/>As is typical of Miyazaki, ""Castle"" is filled with loving details, picturesque towns, interesting machines, beautiful landscapes and that fusion of steam-punk and retro-art which Miyazaki so adores. More interesting is the way all of Miyazaki's major characters go through a physical metamorphosis. Sophie's outward appearance, for example, seems to fluctuate based on self-esteem and mood. Howl is similarly preoccupied with ""how he looks"", using potions and magic to create the illusion of a handsome wizard.<br/><br/>These themes dovetail into the film's thoughts of war and conflict. Here Howl's gradually tainted by partaking in a war between two rival cultures. The more he fights, the more his body becomes black and monstrous. He also literally ""loses his heart"". For Miyazaki, deeds and actions affect beauty as strongly as private perceptions. You are what you do.<br/><br/>""Howl's Moving Castle"" was based on a novel by British author Diana Wynee Jones. Miyazaki has altered Jones' tale slightly, however, and included vast air wars which he says were designed to evoke the Western invasion of Iraq. ""The film was profoundly impacted by the war in Iraq,"" Miyazaki would later reveal. ""The reason I didn't attend the Academy Awards was because I didn't want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq."" <br/><br/>In this regard, the film moves slowly from peace to chaos. When propaganda fliers fall from the sky (perhaps echoing the 2002 dropping of 500,000 pamphlets on Iraq by US airships), Miyazaki's landscapes begin their slow slide toward smoke and flame. For Miyazaki, peace with oneself forestalls conflict, but more importantly, those who pretend to oppose ""evil"" often partake in the very ""evils"" they denounce. By the film's climax, all sides are responsible, even Howl, who spends his days and nights catching the bombs which threaten to fall on innocent civilians. When he retaliates against those who drop them, his hands become overrun with black feathers; he begins to turn into the very monsters he decries.<br/><br/>""Which is who?"" Sophia asks, looking up as armadas swirl. ""What difference does it make?"" comes the reply. Throughout the film, divisions between ""us"" and ""them"" seem irrelevant. There can be no ""good"" and ""bad"", no ""love"" and ""hate"" when the sheer act of partaking in violence makes everyone indistinguishable. Such a stance is reductive and at times false - one can oppose evil and violence, even with violence, and not be ""evil"" - but nevertheless offers an interesting contrast when we consider how wars are actually mis-sold (""We're under attack because we love freedom, and our enemy hates freedom. They hate and we love. We differ from our enemy because we love. Our enemy hates."" - George Bush).<br/><br/>Whilst ""Howls"" first three acts are strong, its final act overwhelms its audience with confusing subplots which make little sense upon first viewing. Only with re-watches do Miyazaki's intentions become clear. Indeed, the film becomes more tragic with familiarity. Howl, for example, is revealed to have ""caught falling stars"" as a child, saving them from impact and so death. One of these ""falling stars"" he ""gives his heart to"" in order to ""save its life"". As Howl grows up, this desire to ""catch falling stars"" stays with him; like the infamous dream in The Catcher in the Rye, Howl's preoccupied with preserving life.<br/><br/>The ""castle"" of Miyazaki's title refers to Howl's home, a bulbous walking machine which epitomises Howl's rootlessness. As the film progresses, this castle falls apart, until it is reborn with wings. Howl and Sophie then fly off into the horizon, recalling an early, charming scene in which he quite literally sweeps the girl off her feet. The film climaxes with conventional light-shows of the kind you don't usually associate with Miyazaki. Howl's also designed to resemble traditional Manga heroes (sharp hair, big eyes, triangular jaw), lending some of the film's visuals a familiar feel. Still, the film's early moments, aided by composer Joe Hisaishi, are as good as Miyazaki at his best.<br/><br/>8/10 – Multiple viewings required."

Often harassed by local boys, one day Sophie is unexpectedly befriended by Howl, a strange but flamboyant wizard whose large home can travel under its own power.

","I had heard great things about this movie and I'm a big fan of the other Hayao Miyazaki's films I've seen (Princess Monoke & Spirited Away) so I was sure I would enjoy this movie. Alas Howl's turned out to be my favorite Miyazaki film and is one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>As in his other films the animation in Howl's Moving Castle was stunning. The behemoth walking castle, the vibrant colors of the various landscape, the ever-changing skies overhead, all contribute to the visual beauty of the movie. The plot of the film was fantastically woven with many surprises, delights, and triumphs which are a testament to both Hayao Miyazaki for the screenplay and Diana Wynne Jones for the novel on which the movie is based. A surprise for many viewers may be the depth of the characters in this animated film. All of the main characters are developed fully which allows the viewer to relate to characters that aren't even necessarily human, in addition to adding realism to each character. <br/><br/>The steampunk technology and the mix of magic and science create a novel type of world for the film to be set in. Its intricate set-up allows the viewer to connect to something entirely different from the world he or she lives in by mixing realistic & fantastical elements. In fact I think one of the things that makes this film particularly astounding is the way it can turn the mundane into the magical. Things that all people can relate to (cleaning, aging, family, war, love) are taken from our world and put into the otherworldly realm of Miyazaki's imagination, where they take on a completely new light. <br/><br/>I absolutely adore the film and it was an immediate 10/10 in my mind. The only thing I disliked was the feeling near the end when one knows the masterpiece is coming to a close which is, of course, unavoidable. Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle is an absolutely beautiful, beautiful film and I recommend it to everyone!"
"toqtaqiya2","8","1","2","9 October 2010"," Once again there is still room for meaning in the world of charming, animated fantasy.
","Director Hayao Miyazaki took Diana Wynne Jones's novel as a basis for his follow-up to Oscar-winner Spirited Away (2001), but adds in his own overriding themes - man's relationship to nature, the futility of war, and the joy of flight. The natural world is beautifully represented as in his previous films, with some absolutely breathtaking mountain and lakeside landscapes. The finest creation of the film, though, is the Castle itself, a cross between Baba Yaga's hut, a Heath Robinson contraption, and one of Terry Gilliam's strange hybrid hens from Monty Python's Flying Circus. The film won a clutch of awards in Japan and overseas, including an Oscar nomination. Howl's Moving Castle is essentially a love story. Talk of magic being used to shield palaces while innocent villages are bombed clues viewers into the deliberate parallels being drawn with the Gulf War of 2003, a conflict that enraged the pacifist Miyazaki during the film's production. If there's one criticism, it's that the overly neat happy ending feels like a cheat after the previous seriousness of the war strand of the story. Yet it remains a complex, rewarding film graced with the acutely observed, colourful and imaginative artwork that is the hallmark of Japan's greatest living national treasure of animation."
"Rectangular_businessman","9","1","2","12 June 2010"," A great animated film
","Howl's Moving Castle is another Miyazaki film and thus at least partially nostalgic and environmentally conscious in its nature. This film is actually less concerned with how we treat nature than how we treat ourselves. It's an antiwar film, showing the horrors that can happen when people fight senseless battles. The conflict with Sophie vacillating between youth and old age depending on her feelings toward Howl is a visual metaphor for one's state of mind. In the end, when she looks young but still has the silvered hair of old age, it represents a coming together of energy and wisdom.<br/><br/>Like most modern Ghibli output, it mixes hand drawn and computer animation in a very subtle way, and has that distinct look and feel of wonderment that makes them very naturally enjoyable. The environment is a little blander than some of Miyazaki's other work but the Castle itself and some of the characters are imaginative as ever. Sophie is another in a long line of young female protagonists in Miyazaki films and Howl is another in the line of supporting male counterparts. Their relationship doesn't have the normal twists and turns you might expect, but that's part of what makes it interesting. The supporting cast is a little more broadly drawn but does well to serve the needs of the story and some comic relief. It wasn't the best thing he's done but still quite above average."

","I caught this wonderfully animated family film when browsing Independent Film Channel (IFC) on cable TV in 2009. IFC claims all the films they shown are uncut. I had no preconceived ideas about the film, never heard of it before hand, and was not familiar with director Miyazaki or his previous work. So my review is based on how I felt about the movie, not how it stacks up against classics or film technique.<br/><br/>Although I am an elder adult and watched it alone, not with my grandchild, I found it engrossing and enjoyable. (Although it is as suitable for young viewers as ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty."") <br/><br/>The story, an anti-war fantasy or fairy tale, was original and unpredictable, which I like. The wizard Howl (who turns out to be the main male character of the film) says at one point something to the effect of ""The problem with a war between rulers is that the bombs fall on the innocent civilians."" <br/><br/>The villains turn out to be complex, not just pure evil, and sometimes not evil at all. <br/><br/>The scenery and costumes are done as a period piece, sort of Victorian era Europe. Even if just viewed as a series of still paintings with no story they would still be interesting to look at.<br/><br/>In keeping with the imaginative story, I think with some imagination they could have come up with a more romantic English title than ""Howl's Moving Castle."" The moving castle certainly is interesting and plays a huge role in the story, but I would have liked something that suggests a struggle between wizards, a struggle over love and hate, and a struggle over war and peace."

As well as poor character development. All I can say is how very western of you.<br/><br/>I had no trouble understanding the plot at all. All the performances were superb. I did not find anything disjointed. I found it to be a wonderful story from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Some people complained about ""loose ends"" such as why the war was occurring, which was explained in the movie (neighboring kingdoms prince had disappeared and they blamed it on the kingdom where the story takes place, turns out a spell was cast on him), or where Howl's apprentice came from (it just doesn't matter in the movie, but viewing the movie one could assume he came across Howl in a similar fashion as Sophie did). These people should watch the movie again, I'm sure they will notice the answers the second time.<br/><br/>The story was so unusual it completely captivated me right from the beginning.<br/><br/>Every bit as good as any of his other movies.<br/><br/>If you love animation, take a break from the commercial works of Dream Works and Pixar (which are fine movies) and treat yourself to something different.

","1st watched 7/26/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Hayao Miyazaki): Complicated and inventive fantasy from legendary Japanese animation director Miyazaki entertains the senses and the mind as well as the heart with this one. The story is about a moving castle lived in by a wizard called Howl as kind of a way of escaping from the responsibility of serving in a war he doesn't believe in. A young girl becomes attached to the character after a spell from a witch makes her old and she goes into the castle. These and other characters are very likable and include a mute scarecrow, a talking fire that moves the castle and more. The animation is wonderful even though sometimes the story is hard to follow. It's also a romantic movie about the young character and Howl, although this doesn't really kick in til' near the end. The female character teaches Howl eventually about not avoiding responsibilities and he learns to deeply care for her. All in all, a very complex story that really is fun also. A winner from this heralded Japanese director."

","Howl's Moving Castle is an excellent book by Diana Wynne Jones. It is an even better movie by Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>This film adaptation of a novel is one of the very few that I've found that actually IMPROVES itself by changing the plot of the book. Roughly the first third of the movie follows the pattern of the novel: a girl named Sophie is transformed into an old woman and must seek out the mysterious wizard Howl in the hopes of changing back. From there, however, the basic structure and purpose of the story are altered to fit Miyazaki's unique style--and it works wonderfully. The movie retains the same humor and heart that makes the book such a delightful read; and does it on its own, without bothering to align the tiny details. In the hands of anyone else, I would have been woefully depressed by the result; however, Studio Ghibli succeeds masterfully in creating a meaningful and deeply fun story that is enjoyable for every age. The art is whimsical and bright, the plot is coherent, and the characters are dimensional and interesting. I'm not a fan of anime in general, but even I can enjoy the liveliness of this delightful movie.<br/><br/>So read Diana Wynne Jones' book for a great story. Watch this movie for a completely different one. But be prepared to enjoy yourself either way."
"lenore_andrea","10","1","2","1 May 2008"," Untrue to the novel, but with value of its own.
","This movie is a very simplistic version of Diana Wynne Jones' excellent novel. Some of the best moments and characters of the book are absent or have been changed significantly. For instance, many of the angry and exasperated interaction of Sophie and Howl have been cut. For example, Sophie's anger when she realizes that Howl and Michael know that she is enchanted through espionage, or the battle of Howl's suits. However, it is redeemed through excellent animation, artwork, and characterization. All characters are excellently played, although Howl and Calcifer are most true to the book. It is disappointing that Sophie is portrayed as insecure about her appearance, although that is done excellently. However, I simply feel that Sophie's reasons for suppressing her independence were excellent in the book (a feeling that she would not amount to very much due to tradition, and that if she could not realize her dreams, she must take care of her family) and that appearance is too often a concern for young women in movies. While appearance can be a major factor in limiting young women, it is not the only factor. Only discussing appearance shapes how young women will often react to discussing other problems: they will be less likely to. Even more worrisome, they actually may begin to consider the problems unimportant and singular to themselves."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","1","2","29 December 2007"," A breathtaking film and one of Miyazaki's best.
","I've been a fan of Miyazaki's work since I first saw My Neighbour Totoro and Porco Rosso during a mid-90's double bill and fell in love with the intricate stories, simply, yet larger than life characters, and the always breathtaking visuals. A recent Film Four retrospective on the work of Miyazaki and the famed Studio Ghibli has given me the opportunity to reacquaint myself with some of his earlier works, which has really been great preparation for readying myself for a second helping of this!!<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is loosely based on the well-known book of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, with Miyazaki and his collaborators opening up and elaborating on the text in order to incorporate many of the more recognisable Studio Ghibli trademarks. So, whereas the book once focused more clearly on the character of Howl, a wizard of dubious reputation, Miyazaki puts more emphasis on the character of Sofi, a heroine in the classic Studio Ghibli tradition. As the story unfolds the changes in the text point back to that earlier Miyazaki classic Porco Rosso, with the film continuing the idea of a character transformed by a curse (in this case, the young Sofi is cursed into the body of an old hag), seeking redemption in a anachronistic universe sometime during the First World War, that is overrun with flying machines, magical potions and other such Ghibli-like touches, such as fire demons, witchcraft and supernatural underworlds.<br/><br/>As with Porco Rosso, the film's setting and the use of iconography suggest deeper themes that most children probably won't pick up on, meaning that this is very much a film to be cherished by adults and adolescents too!! As with all Miyazaki's work, the animation is astounding, here advancing on the lush visuals of previous film Spirited Away to create perhaps the most jaw-dropping animated film ever made (though Mamuro Oshii's Ghost in the Shell 2 and Katsuhiro Otomo's Steamboy are both serious contenders). The colours are rich and vivid throughout, whilst the attention to even the most minute of period detail is impeccable, all adding to that sweeping Miyazaki grace, his feel for characters and his deft understanding of how to construct a sequence (both in terms of action and drama... making the film both magical and plausible in equal measures!!).<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle might be a little too obscure and sober for some viewers, especially when compared to some of Miyazaki's more celebrated works, such as My Neighbour Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, however, some perseverance reveals it to be every bit as memorable and beautiful as those two films, whilst the subtle references to early Miyazaki works like The Castle of Cagliostro and Laputa - Castle In The Sky make it an integral and equally magical entry into the Ghibli/Miyazaki canon."

","I am typically not a fan of most films animated in this fashion. Strangely I felt compelled to watch it and completely captivated. It had a very unique and wholly childish view of wars as novel games with no purpose. Interestingly enough it doesn't have any problems with violence so long as it is in rebellion of the establishment. The love story is sadly too faint, yet the fanciful imagery and delightful characters make this move entirely entertaining to the end. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>I think fewer words are better, IMDb thinks otherwise. So I am forced to add more.<br/><br/>If you stay focused on the movie you will easily understand it and it will be pleasantly predictable. If how ever if you want you want to be surprised or want to tax your mind, walk away from the movie skip 20 or so minutes. I don't believe this movie to be too childish but a child would enjoy it equally. No obscenity and fairly tame with no death graphic injuries. I believe shallow people will not get into this movie completely, but they should watch it the same. It would be unhealthy and truly depressing to eat the same super every night, even if it is our favorite meal."

To break the curse, she seeks out Howl -a powerful wizard- and his mobile magical castle. Also dwelling there are the fire demon Calcifer (which also holds Howl's heart), and a young boy learning magic. As the story goes, Sophie and Howl fall in love with each other while trying to thwart the witch's curse on Sophie and somehow restore Howl's heart without destroying both him and Calcifer.

","For some reason, I always go into watching films by Miyazaki with a more than unexpected amount of hesitation. And yet, I usually find myself remarkably surprised and, in the end, both moved and thoroughly entertained. This happened when I watched both Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. There's a very unique feel to the films by Miyazaki and it's immediately foreign, yet after a little time, I find it tugging at my soul in surprising ways.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is about a young girl named Sophi, who gets turned into a 90-year old woman by a curse and ends up living with a wizard that she has a crush on. And some stuff happens afterward.<br/><br/>Immediately striking is the visual style of the film, which is in the same fantastic and imaginative vein as other films produced by Studio Ghibli. The central theme of love, although often ambiguous, is quite potent, although not as nuanced as the portrayal of maturity and hope found in Spirited Away. Nevertheless, the story, which cannot be described without throwing spoilers everywhere is wonderful and whimsical, but maintains all the coherence necessary for a western audience to understand it.<br/><br/>And, there's precious little more that I can say about this film, other than that it's great and I highly recommend it. It's a beautiful little film about love. Also, the professional American voice talent recruited for this film are far competent for their tasks and Billy Crystal in particular is surprisingly suited for the voice of the fire demon, Calcifur. Great voice ensembles like these put the amateurs that voice dubbed anime television programs to great shame (the 6 people that do all the voices, that is).<br/><br/>I love it. 9/10."

","Howl's Moving Castle is an amazing movie made by animation genius Hayao Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli). If not familiar with his name, Miyazaki-san also created ""Spirited Away,"" ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Porco Rosso,"" and ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds."" Howl's Moving Castle is his latest film to date and is sure to be an instant classic.<br/><br/>The story follows nineteen-year-old Sophie, a shy girl with a lack of self confidence who works in her family's hat shop. Everybody in town is talking about the mysterious Wizard Howl who arrived recently- they can't wait to meet the handsome wizard! Sophie, however doesn't bother with the gossip and decides to walk to her sister Lettie's work and pay her a call. While walking to her sister's job, a bakery, she turns down an alley and runs into two soldiers. Shy and a bit confused, she tries to avoid their flirting, but fails.... A handsome blonde man saves her from the flirts, but involves her into his own escape- from the dreaded Witch of the Waste's henchmen. The man takes hold of Sophie and lightly lifts her up and flies through the sky. He drops her off at her sister's work and flies off. Could it be the mysterious Wizard Howl?!?!?!? When Sophie returns home from her sister's, she closes the hat shop. A large, bulging woman enters the closed shop, jeers Sophie, and when Sophie sticks up for herself, the woman turns Sophie into an old woman. The woman admits that she is the Witch of the Waste and leaves speedily. Sopie is then left with the problem of being a nineteen-year-old girl who is stuck in an eighty-year-old's body. Sophie leaves her house and job to find a cure for the curse. She finds a scarecrow on the way and he leads her to HOWL'S CASTLE! She falls asleep by a fire and wakes up to see Howl's apprentice, Markl. She tells Markl that she's the new cleaning lady. Howl arrives back to his castle... but Howl's the handsome man from the day before!!!! What could this situation evolve into....?<br/><br/>If you find it hard to love the remarkable, AMAZING story, you won't be able to help falling in love with the colors, detail, and the scenery of this animation. The Japanese and the English voice actors are great, but I recommend listening to the Japanese- it's a great version and has much more detailed dialog (the English subtitles are good, too). <br/><br/>This movie is based upon the novel by Diana Wynne Jones.<br/><br/>I hope that my comments help!

The attention to detail in the drawing, colouring and design in every single frame is without equal. The images are so vibrant that at times they almost saturate the senses: cities with a fantastic splendour from an imagined Europe of a century ago; mountain meadows with clouds scudding across them and drifts of wild flowers; a wizard's bedroom crammed with magical instruments and rendered in such detail that you could discover some unseen facet if you watched the scene a score of times. Unforgettable image follows unforgettable image through out this film.<br/><br/>All the characters are well drawn, with the usual Ghibli trait of ambiguity as to the ""good"" or ""evil"" status of each. If there is a weakness in this movie then it is possibly in the plot. More precisely the plot resolution, which does seem to leave a few loose ends.

","""Howl's moving castle"" is indeed a loose adaption of the novel by Dianna Wyn Jones. I've seen pretty much most of Miyazaki's more famous and also less known works, compared to Spirited Away, this movie does lack something, probably the charm and soul, I'm not quite sure. None the less, it is a lovely film. <br/><br/>Each character is well voiced and well personified through the animation, such as Howl himself whose vain nature and cowardly reputation cover a more charming, more darker persona that is unveiled by Sophie. When the curse is placed on Sophie, I found she was a more likable character, as the older version had a much richer sense of humour and lovable attitude. Calcifer is definitely a show stealer, as Billy Crystal's voice is much suited for the fire demon, he is much of the humour that can be found in this film, along with Turniphead who still stands as my favourite character in the whole film. <br/><br/>The story does flow nicely, but the dub may have lost some of the general plot as it can be all over the place at times, and reading the novel doesn't always fill in the blank spaces. That is most likely where the film falls due to such a long winding confusing plot, but nevertheless!<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is worth the watch, just because of the charm it has."

","Thanks in part to the equally wonderful 'Triplets of Bellevue' - the family have recently discovered that there is a whole world out there of imaginative and beatuiful animated film making. We've seen quite a number lately from Hayao Miyazaki and others - but to my mind this is our favourite so far.<br/><br/>The story is of a plain girl who is turned into an old maid by a witch who is in turn in love with a wizard called Howl. The girl goes to work for Howl in his 'moving castle' as a cleaning lady and meets and befriends various characters during her adventures. Her relationship develops with Howl against a backdrop of a futile war and her struggle to find her youth once more.<br/><br/>There is so much visual imagination in this film that you find yourself hitting 'pause' a lot to take the scenery in. It deserves the time. Some vistas are barely on screen for more than a second - but will take your breath away.<br/><br/>The voice overs are well done - but I particularly liked Lauren Bacall as the witch of the waste. The music is equally stunning - with a main theme you never tire of. All in all - superb.<br/><br/>PS. If you liked this - then you should also check out 'Whisper of the Heart', and 'Laputa'."
"Two_Pieces_of_Christina","7","1","2","15 May 2006"," An inspired expansion on an already classic tale.
","Loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones's 1986 novel, this is the tale of young hat-worker Sophie Hatter. When a curse is placed on her by the Wicked Witch of the Waste, she turns into a 90-year old woman. Ashamed of her looks, and fearing she will be of no use to her step-mother in their shop, she flees to the countryside in seek of shelter and to somehow get help to lift the curse.<br/><br/>On her journey she meets a helpful scarecrow (who, incidentally, is a source of terror in the novel) who directs her to local wizard Howl's 'Moving Castle'. This isn't just a name - Howl's castle does indeed move - it hops along on spindly legs, groaning under its weight, and puffs of steam emanate into the surrounding air. Inside, Sophie finds the castle is not all as it seems - it is disproportionately small and shabby, and able to open its door onto four different locations at will. Calcifer, a fire demon, powers the castle and Howl is not quite the evil, girl's heart-eating wizard he's made out to be. Instead he's shallow, vain, tempestuous and, to Sophie's horror, handsome. Sophie makes a deal with Calcifer to break the contract he holds with Howl, in return for her curse being lifted. But will Sophie end up breaking the spell herself, and will Howl in fact see her for what she really is - a beautiful, resourceful young woman, and return her feelings?<br/><br/>World-renowned director Hayao Miyazaki has done a good job here. He has taken great liberties with Diana Wynne Jones's original story, but this is no bad thing in some ways - the film is a pure visual feast. From the Wicked Witch of the Waste's obese puffing up the palace stairs, to Calcifer's near death, and Howl's slime explosion, there are some brilliant images here. The scope and depth of the scenery, the close-ups of Sophie's eyes, and Howl's blond hair have all been obviously attended to with great detail.<br/><br/>I would urge anyone to watch the original film with subtitles. The actors' voices are much more in tone with what's on screen, in particular Calcifer's comical screeching shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>I'm all for artistic vision, and the different ways that novels translate from page to screen. However one major aspect that I didn't agree with in this version was Sophie's differing appearance - when angered, or in a fit of passion, she grows younger before our eyes. She's cursed, not just emotional! If it was as easy as that perhaps she wouldn't need to hang out at the castle mopping Howl's floor.<br/><br/>Don't worry if you haven't read the novel first, but do make a point to do so at some point (anything written by Wynne-Jones is worth a read, for that matter). Although this film does arguably stand on its own merits, to miss the genius of Wynne-Jones's writing would be a great shame.<br/><br/>This film is a good example of well-crafted animation, inspiration and directorial vision."

Personally, I think the castle ranks as one of cinema's most incredible visual creations - a lumbering, wheezing mechanical colossus that rumbles along the countryside. Characters in the film stop to stare when it passes, and you too will be taken in by its awkward majesty.<br/><br/>Like a lot of other people, I am a Miyazaki fan and I must agree this is not his best work. But when your body of work is as accomplished as his, that is not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, I would still say Howl's Moving Castle was my favourite film that year.<br/><br/>I agree with those who say watch it in its original Japanese soundtrack. Yes, the American actors do their best, and it's not a bad cast, but there is something quintisentially Japanese about all of Miyazaki's films, and these subtle nuances are inevitably lost in translation. No fault of the English-speaking actors or Lasseter himself who supervised the dub, that's just the way it is.<br/><br/>So to calibrate your expectations - it's not as good as Spirited Away, but it does have that Miyazaki magic, and that's all the reason you really need to go see it."

'howl's moving castle' is no different to any other Miyazaki outing.<br/><br/>One major difference the film has compared to both 'spirited away' and 'princess mononoke' is its slightly westernised setting, this is clear from the very first few shots central characters home town.

Its not until a brief encounter with the mysterious and handsome sorcerer howl that you really begin to see the Miyazaki magic beginning to weave its web and my oh my what a web, shortly after her meeting with the enchanting, romanticized magician she comes into contact with another magically inclined being whose traits couldn't be further from howl's, she is the legendarily sinister witch of the waste, a rather large, grotesque and somewhat generously proportioned hag ( I mean to say she's rather fat). She is as ugly as she is powerful, as Sophie soon finds out when the insanely jealous witch places a curse on her as a result of her encounter with the elusive howl , Turning Sophie from a frumpily garbed yet captivating beautiful young woman into a time ravaged, grey haired old lady, as if that wasn't enough the witch reveals one final but sinister twist in Sophie's curse "" The best part about that spell, is that you can't tell anyone about it"" she chortles as she leaves Sophie reeling in despair and its here Miyazaki's tale really takes off, without revealing too much (more that is) Sophie heads off to the wastelands, a place teaming with the magically inclined and stumbles upon howls moving castle as well as a host of other equally endearing friends, including turnip head a rather tatter some scarecrow with a secret , the disgruntled but often hilarious Calcifer the fire demon and the imp like Markl a young apprentice of howl's. The film offers a sentimental, heart warming tale of a band of misfits who were lost within the realms of normality finding a place (and a family) somewhere they least expected to, inside howls moving castle. The film has major helpings of tyranny, war, love, hate and of course the oh so relevant subliminal messages all Miyazaki's lovingly crafted masterpieces contain.

In Princess Mononoke, in every action we could see the motive. This is not always the case here.<br/><br/>Besides that, this movies reminds us a lot of Miyazaki's previous works, like Laputa. As a result, this world does not seem as impressive as the ones we've been used to so far.<br/><br/>What gave me the worst impression was the ending.

You may understand after you have seen ""Howl's Moving Castle"" for yourself."

","Alright, I'm not gonna lie to you. HMC is flawed. Then again, what isn't?<br/><br/>The very best thing about this movie is that you actually care about the characters. <br/><br/>I often end up half-rooting for the villains in most movies, but not here. Miyzaki, has created such deep and lovable characters(especially Calcifer) that every little problem they faced had me doubled up in worry. <br/><br/>The story is interesting too, though a little lacking. The cities are on the brink of war, due to foolishness and random gobbledy-gook that i didn't understand. <br/><br/>And here's where Miyazaki goofed up. While he should have made the entire war drama more, well, dramatic, he instead replaced it with cleverness. We get a serious scene that could have easily escalated into something more profound and moving with Miyazaki's talents, but rarely does. Many of the scenes (especially the ending) feel like they should end with an earth shattering bang. Instead they all end abruptly, leaving us scratching our heads and wondering what the hell was the point Miyazaki was trying to make.<br/><br/>Of course, Miyazaki has to be aware of his target audience, which unfortunately includes the little ones, so I can't really blame him for not going further. I would have preferred it if he went for the profound rather than the clever, but hey that's life. This is STILL a great film that everyone should see. 8/10, maybe 8.5/10"
"cherold","8","1","2","19 July 2005"," just plain magical
","After Spirited Away I was very anxious to see Miyazaki's new movie, and I was not disappointed. Once again he has made a magical, lyrical work of art and entertainment. This movie makes me think of the Wizard of Oz, not for the story but just for the way in which everything is touched by magic. Everything is created by magic or cursed by magic so you just have to call the film magical. Characters are well drawn and the movie is very funny but with a thoughtful, melancholy quality that comes out now and again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Miyazaki was little sloppy in terms of story. At the end of the movie, neither I nor my girlfriend understood what it was that happened to howl or what Madam Suliman's agenda was. The rumors about Howl are mentioned then dropped and there's a plot development at the end for which no groundwork has been laid at all.<br/><br/>But Howl's Moving Castle is ultimately so engaging and directed with such assuredness that one can forgive its flaws."
"noralee","8","1","2","18 July 2005"," A Visual Whirlwind of Humor and Magic, But a Bit Confusing
","""Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)"" builds on the animation and special effects classics of the past to create a marvelous visual world, though I haven't read the Diana Wynne Jones novel to know how much is invented by adapter/director Hayao Miyazaki.<br/><br/>There's the scarecrow, magic meadow and shrinking witch from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the scary forest from ""Sleeping Beauty,"" the spell on the hero from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the frightening, drunken nightmare from ""Dumbo,"" the Cheshire Cat from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" the battles from the Disney studio's anti-Nazi propaganda cartoons, the sad statue from Oscar Wilde's ""The Happy Prince,"" the chicken-legged house from the Russian Babi-Yar legends, as well as visual references to the classic adaptations of ""Yellow Submarine"" and ""Gulliver's Travels,"" while characters morph in and out of spells like the faces from a classic Michael Jackson video.<br/><br/>But this tale has unusual elements not seen before, as the tributes fly by. The spell by a spurned witch seems to have ironically turned the hero into a threatening woman-chaser, though, confusingly, as the spell progresses, and even more confusing when we travel to the past to see how he got enchanted, he becomes a peacemaker when the film suddenly changes to a war, causing him to fight off another physical transformation, like the demon-bitten hero of ""Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime),"" with a strong anti-war message.<br/><br/>The witch has also cast a spell on the heroine, turning her into an old woman, and much of the delightful humor is from her struggling with her infirmities even as gray power triumphs, such as a scene when she and her nemesis compete to get up the royal stairs.<br/><br/>Every inch of the screen is filled with a dazzling and quickly changing scene and climate and would make the sub-titled version a distraction. The English-language voices are mixed in effectiveness. Christian Bale is surprisingly bland with his Americanized accent, Emily Mortimer confusingly British as the young heroine. Lauren Bacall and Blythe Danner are marvelous as mature witches, and Jean Simmons as old Sophie is both touching and humorous. Billy Crystal is way over the top as Calcifer the fire, but brings to mind his small role in ""The Princess Bride,"" and such sidekicks are usually done for broad humor.<br/><br/>This is the first Miyazaki film I've seen in a theater so I don't know if the detail in his previous works is quite so breathtaking. It is charmingly set in a Jules Verne-period Victoriana where technology can coexist with magic, such as in flying machines. A complex townscape with streetcars is trumped by lovely scenes of snow falling and rain slowly soaking a dress.<br/><br/>While the mother isn't dead as in most such films, just a bit pre-occupied, the occupants of the Castle re-create their own family, including caring for the apparently now senile witch -- wouldn't it be nice if we could all just add another bathroom to our houses.<br/><br/>The music is fairly corny, so the long patches of silence are a relief.<br/><br/>I don't know why this has been mostly distributed through art houses as children in the wider world of multiplexes would enjoy it, even if the story is a bit complicated and confusing."
"vertigo_14","8","1","2","10 July 2005"," A wonderfully original story. Had it not been for the sappy ending, I would rate it a perfect ten! (spoilers)
","'Howls Moving Castle' is one of my favorite animated feature films. I wasn't as impressed with Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away and have yet to see any of his other feature films. But this one, however, has great characters, a sense of humor, a unique plot, and would have been perfect in my book had it not been for a the sappy ending in which everything is easily and predictability resolved Walt Disney style. This being the same unfortunate state that marred another one of my favorites, Garden State.<br/><br/>'Howl's Moving Castle' refers to just that, a floating contraption which looks like an island conglomeration of houses and trees which move around on robotic legs and emit plenty of pollution. Our main character is not actually Howl, but a young girl who befriends Howl, but through a curse, is turned into an old woman. Trying to figure out how to restore herself, she finds work in the Moving Castle as a maid where she befriends it's few residents--a young boy, a ball of fire (or rather, the igniting soul of a fire, and the mysterious Howl. In the meantime, she likewise becomes involved with Howl's participation in an ongoing war. The plot by this point becomes slightly complicated to explain without giving too much away only because several other characters enter the story, imposing a few more subplots.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is, unlike other animated features, not wonderful by any means for the animated style. For the most part, if you've seen one Japanimated cartoon these days, you've seen them all in their inglorious, standardized form. And perhaps, this is where Hayao Miyazaki and his film-making team should experiment with new styles and approaches. Instead, the beauty of the film, at least for me, is largely due to such a unique and engaging story. I am normally not a fan of this genre, but I really enjoyed this particular one."

","I saw the Japanese subtitled version, and must concur in the praise given to the Japanese actors, particularly the guy doing Calcifer.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this. This is the first Miyazaki movie I've ever seen (and one of the few animes) and I thought it was really beautifully done, with a pervasive sense of place and a nice sense of ""magical logic""(meaning a sense that the supernatural things one sees make a kind of sense, follow a kind of rule, even if it's not clear immediately what that is.) Movie suffers a bit from being thematically all over the place, from ""age is a state of mind"" to ""make the best of the hand you're dealt"" to a general distrust of power to what eventually becomes a kind of antiwar message. On the other hand, there is an utterly fantastic moment toward the end of the picture (where Sophie stumbles through a door and sees the young Howl make a bargain with the demon) which sent a real chill up my spine: it's the kind of thing you go to the movies to see.

"Kiyoshi777","8","1","2","19 June 2005"," Howl's Moving Castle - A Flawed Delight
","Supreme Japanese animation lord Hayao Miyazaki's latest film release, Howl's Moving Castle, is both a solid success and a slight failure. Based upon the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle lacks nothing in terms of imagination or strong characters. Despite being adapted from the novel, the film still reeks of the delicious Miyazaki flavor, and fans of his previous work will be right at home. In fact, Howl's Moving Castle has such a Miyazaki-esquire plot that one would never infer that it's based upon a novel.<br/><br/>One would think that being based off of a book would ensure a detailed and nearly perfect plot. The plot, however, is the movie's greatest shortcoming. While it starts off as intriguing, it eventually deteriorates into a somewhat sloppy, vague mess. The film's most significant and apparent plot devices seem rushed and lack necessary background info, forcing the audience to fill in many dark areas based upon their own inferences. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if the movie didn't have the habit of merely alluding to the slightest of implications.<br/><br/>For instance, the entire cataclysm for Howl's plot is the Wicked Witch of the Waste putting a curse on main character Sophie which turns her into an old woman. The witch walks into the girl's shop after hours for no apparent reason (though in the book it's made clear that the witch is in actuality dissatisfied with a purchased garment; this is never brought up in the movie), bullies poor, innocent Sophie, and then sets her curse without a second thought. It isn't until much later in the movie that the audience can even begin to piece together a strong reason why the witch would do such a thing to Sophie (it seems to me that it has to do with a strong jealousy in regards to the character known as Howl), and even then the audience doesn't gain much evidence from the movie to support such interpretations. In fact, the entire plot line suffers from similar faulty foundation: the entire war situation is barely developed, the declared love between the two main characters seems to come out of nowhere (sure, the film has its charming subtleties in this regard  don't think I missed them  but it seems a bit unrealistic that the two characters would be so settled on their feelings), and the main villain is utterly wasted.<br/><br/>What the movie lacks in terms of plot is more than made up for in almost every other aspect. The animation is perhaps the finest I have ever experienced: I was on the verge of goose bumps the first time I saw Howl's castle walk across the fog-shrouded landscape. Just as impressive are the sprawling environments that the characters find themselves in. The interior of Howl's castle is beautiful and unique, particularly Howl's bedroom. Howl's ""secret garden"" is awe-inspiring, and all of the various towns have a very real look to them. The numerous aircraft are also lovingly detailed and are certainly something that Hayao Miyazaki is to take pride in considering his love for planes and flight sequences.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle also has some of the most fantastic characters ever conceived in an animated movie. Every single one of them, no matter how major or understated, is absolutely bursting with personality. Much of this is attributable to Miyazaki's distinctive art style, but the writing and situations are perhaps most important in developing the characters. Take special note when main characters interact with secondary ones: oftentimes, the underplayed characters are perhaps the most interesting, particularly Sophie's mother: she's even more detestable than the main villain, even despite her subtle deviance.<br/><br/>Also worth noting are the movie's numerous and potent messages. While Miyazaki's pro-nature messages are growing to be a bit pedestrian (and are a lot less pungent here than in Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds), his thoughts on greed and love are quite different than anything he's preached before. Indeed, the sheer beauty of this movie's messages is that they're so effective because of the wonderful characterization and the glorious art. At one pivotal point in the movie, the Wicked Witch of the Waste is transformed into a most miserable state, which is perhaps the most powerful tool in conveying the sorrowful yet human anti-greed message.<br/><br/>All in all, despite a somewhat frail plot, Howl's Moving Castle is a resounding success. It's not creative enough to top Miyazaki's Spirited Away, nor is it deep or serious enough to be considered on par with his masterpiece Princess Mononoke, but it is a worthy entry to his overall legacy. Fans young and old alike should experience this film, and they should definitely bring a friend. You'll laugh, and with a bit of luck, maybe shed a tear or two. Maybe. If you haven't seen any of Miyazaki's past work, this is perhaps not the best place to start as it certainly isn't his best work. If you're hungry for more, however, make no mistake: this is a movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>* * * out of * * * *"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>If you like Hayao Miyazaki's works you might be pretty disappointed by ""How's Moving Castle"" (2004). Visually this movie looks amazing - so many colors, drawings - sometimes they are breathtaking. But the story here is absolute mess. The beginning was intriguing. Later, at somewhere around ~40 min in it's running time, and starting to have some questions. Later on, i started to wonder - what the heck is going on in here. By the end i didn't care at all - just which it would end sooner, but this movie is SO long, way to long. I know that this is fantasy, but in director other movies stories were very interesting and intriguing, but this one lacks any credibility. By the end of this movie i had so many question why that or that happened, how and etc. But it would have had any sense, i would care.<br/><br/>Overall, ""How's Moving Castle"" is amazingly looking and amazingly empty and not involving movie. The story is here is beyond any fantasy stories he ever made, there are no rules - everyone can fly or whatever. It's ridiculously boring, and it's hard for me to say this because i truly admire this director Work, but this one is just pretty lame."
"PiranianRose","8","2","7","17 April 2005"," Not Miyazaki's best
","I am not an expert on Japanese anime or on the director by any stretch of imagination. That said, Howl is the 3rd animation I have seen from Miyazaki. I think it is generally a respectable work, immensely enjoyable from start to late into the film, but somehow the last 20 minutes or so seems less polished in terms of story and character transition, resulting in a *slightly* disappointing ending. One aspect I really like from Miyazaki's works is that the characters are almost never one dimensional--for example our master Howl who first seems like the perfect leader may have surprised us when his semi-metrosexual attitude is revealed. In this manner, Howl's Moving Castle, like the other films I have seen by Miyazaki, blends reality (imperfect human traits) and rich imagination (excellent visual) in its magical universe."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","1","3","16 March 2019"," Endearingly strange.
","'Howl's Moving Castle (2004)' is certainly a strange film. It's an endearingly strange film, though. It's filled to the brim with interesting ideas, inventive visuals and inspired animation, which makes up for its somewhat scattershot central story and slightly strange pacing. The characters are all very well realised - and beautifully dubbed, I'll add - but the titular Howl is ever so slightly inconsistent (or, at least, presented inconsistently). Of course, his enigmatic nature is a part of his appeal, but he seems to lack a solid motivation - as do several of the other side-players - and the more we learn, the less it makes sense, in a way. Even our protagonist loses her drive part-way through, putting aside her quest simply to spend time as a housemaid. In her case, however, her character always shines through as she's constantly a wise, kindhearted person who's willing to forgive even those who have done her the most wrong. The narrative she finds herself caught up in isn't quite as strong-willed, but it's suitably tumultuous and charmingly off-beat. It keeps you engaged through its duration and is certainly unique, allowing Miyazaki and his team to play around with their intriguing designs and animation techniques. I especially enjoy the tar-like henchmen that pursue our heroes; their bulging bodies squeeze through small gaps, twist together as they struggle to stay upright and merge with one another to form huge, undulating masses. Overall, though it has some issues and doesn't hit home as hard as it perhaps should (in its more emotional moments), this is an entertaining affair throughout. It's a visual treat, too. 6/10"
"Seraphion","4","1","3","12 September 2014"," Entertaining but not as much as other Studio Ghibli's works
","The movie opens slowly with intriguing first scene. It brings the viewers to another fantasy world definitive of Studio Ghibli. But this time the world setting gets to feel more victorian, steampunk and technological besides being magical. The story floats in and out of contrasting conflicts, another signature of Japanese anime aimed at various age groups. Yet I don't like how the movie keeps changing Sophie's age back and forth without any clear explanation. The story also ends quite abruptly with the background conflict of the war just ceasing out unclear. The voice acting on the Japanese version is a standard Japanese work with less dramatic voice acting yet with more quirky voice timbres."
"Quinoa1984","9","1","3","30 December 2006"," loaded with enough imagination and sweet vibes for three movies!
","I can't say for certain, especially after only seeing the English-language dub of the film in the theater (and seeing bits of it again on TV)- that Howl's Moving Castle is one of the very best of the great Hayao Miyazaki's feature films. But I didn't leave it feeling un-happy in the slightest, and if anything I remember most the feeling of uplift, which is what the best fairy tales try to accomplish. It follows the strand left by Spirited Away (though also trailing off from other Miyazaki films to be sure) where a female character is the protagonist thrust into strange circumstances, really around a curse.<br/><br/>Sophie (voiced by Emily Mortimer and the great Jean Simmons in the English dub) gets cursed by an evil witch, and then meets up at Howl's castle (Howl, by the way, is a slightly melancholy and quirky wizard, voiced in a fun way by Christian Bale), and sets about to make herself useful, however to also keep order in the guide of her now old-lady persona (and, more importantly, to free herself from the curse). She also has to contend with an overly cautious flame (Billy Crystal, odd choice for a talking fire, but it works better than I expected), and a scarecrow who sometimes just can't sit still.<br/><br/>Soon Sophie becomes the unwitting assistant to Howl, as she goes in partial disguise to help him be present instead of him before his former tutor, Madame Suliman. And, of course, in the meantime, a love story unfolds. Although I could argue that Howl's Moving Castle begins to stray a little from the completely satisfying world portrayed in Spirited Away or particularly in Princess Mononoke- and that the story is given way, frustrations and all, for the visual wonderment- it's still a delight from start to finish. While I wondered when I first saw it if the Japanese dialog would make a difference by much, seeing the American voices didn't detract much at all, and if anything the cast fulfills the story more than one could hope for. <br/><br/>And, of course, those visual inventions are never to be taken for granted in Miyazaki's world (more than likely attributable to the source from Diana Wynne Jones and leaning more to Western influence then the decidedly awesomely Eastern Mononoke). If anything individual moments, like when Howl almost melts away from not having certain powers, is really intriguing, or in just seeing the castle itself, with all of the little parts and spindles a marvel in and of itself (Ebert's not far off from saying that it's one of the great unique places of the movies, and for me almost resides on the other industrial side of the cutesy wonderment of Totoro).<br/><br/>I definitely need to watch it again, as Miyazaki's worlds usually do, but for now I do recommend it, even if you've never seen one of his films. Little girls too, I'd imagine, might get an extra kick out of the strong-willed female lead and the strong romantic interests in the storyline (and having a handsome leading man voiced by Bale doesn't hurt either)."
"Smallsis7","9","1","3","25 November 2006"," Absolutely Magical
","Howl's Moving Castle is absolutely magical, as is Hayao Miyazaki's style. I had read the original book before the movie (me being the book worm and all...) and I love how Miyazaki kept the essence of the book but added his own twist/style to his movie version. I've been an admirer of his art ever since I had seen Kiki's Delivery Service when I was 7 yrs. of age, and his unique style always seems to capture me in the world of the movie. Also, the way that Miyazaki always gives life lessons to each movie without being too obvious is a show of his experience as a director. Miyazaki gives all of his characters such life-like qualities (including the negative qualities), and I'm sure each of them would redefine the meaning of a hero or role model once you've seen his work. I'm sure many reviewers might say "" A 9/10! That's absurdly too high!"" Yet, Miyazaki has a way with weaving stories into brilliant tapestries unlike many of the other animators in his time."

Some of the best characters and stories as a child and pre-teen came from many of these artists, so I am always interested in looking at recent animations and animes. If I were 6 again, I would love the heck out of Howl's Moving castle as I did those pieces of animation and anime. Even now that I am older, I think this is just a wonderful whimsy piece of animation.<br/><br/>The images/the animation in this film are remarkable especially: Howl's Moving Castle. You cannot deny how much work was placed into just this piece. Every time it came on screen, it catches your attention. Just wonderful. The story was whimsical and as with many pieces of animation and anime of this kind, you have to suspend your belief and just be taken away by the entertainment. The story is simple: a very shy unconfident girl (Sophie) gets cursed by a vengeful witch who turns her into a 90 year old. She hides in Howl's moving castle until she can find a solution to her problem - hoping that elusive Howl can also find a solution to her problem.<br/><br/>Once in Howl's very strange castle, you do keep hearing: ""How can you help me when you can't solve your own problem?"" Even when Sophie finds the witch who cast the spell on her the witch relies, ""I can only cast spells, I cannot take them back."" How odd! But that tells you much about this film as well.<br/><br/>And then there is Howl. Why is he elusive? What is he trying to do? Is he good or bad, or just trying to escape both to find out exactly who he is? You actually watch Howl's transformations as he himself battles this out. It's quite interesting to see.<br/><br/>As in much animation and anime of this kind, nothing is tied up nicely-neatly and there are a few things that make you think about it afterward. But this is a story of sorcery, of change, of strength, of war, of peace and finding enough love within yourself to love others."

","HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE <br/><br/>HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, my first Miyazaki film, is the story of shy young woman named Sofi who is turned into an old woman by the Witch of the Waste. As an old woman, Sofi leaves for the hills where she is picked up by the legendary Moving Castle. There, she meets a fire demon named Calcifer who bargains with her to help her reverse her curse if Sofi can free Calcifer from serving Howl himself.<br/><br/>This film is an example of someone allowing their imagination to be completely free... and Miyazaki manages to bring his creativity together in a visual spectacle of a film. How cohesive the job is in the end is up for debate. At times, the story leaves too many stones unturned, or adds too many complications to keep everything clear. As a result, the emotional impact of the film is dulled b/c the audience is left unsure of what everything means... at least I was. However, this is a film that rests on the strength of it's sheer creativity.<br/><br/>At times, the story feels so wonderfully creative that I was reminded of true classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Sofi makes for a wonderful leading lady and it is a joy to follow her through this story. She changes from a gentile, shy young shop girl into a grumpy old woman... and yet she always remains a likable central presence. However, what separates this film from classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ and WONDERLAND is it's inability to be clear.<br/><br/>Those pieces feature some of the most wildly imaginative characters and stories ever created, and yet in the end they always make complete sense and are incredibly satisfying. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE captivated my attention the entire time, however, it never left me feeling that I was watching a concrete story arch.<br/><br/>In addition, the central character of Calcifer is a real disappointment here. The character, voiced by an uninspired Billy Crystal, stands out as a poor animation job amidst the beautiful artistry that makes the rest of HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE so enjoyable. The character of a fire demon should have opened the doors for some wonderful artistic interpretation... but instead, Miyazaki seems to have opted for a character straight out of the ""how to create a funny/cute sidekick"" guidebook. In a film so full of wonderfully out of the box creations, it is really a shame that such a central element is so boringly cliché.<br/><br/>Otherwise, though the story definitely has loop holes and Calcifer is a huge disappointment, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE still is an incredibly enjoyable and interesting film. It takes chances with it's imagination unlike 90% of the animated films being released today b/c it takes a refreshingly non-commercial approach (except for Calcifer). HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a fun, interesting film that may have some noticeable flaws... but it does deserve extra credit for reaching further then the average animated film.<br/><br/>... B/B+ ..."

Each brought something of their own to the story to make it a compelling and an interesting watch. Miyazaki captures you in with the first few seconds of the film with his beautiful artwork and interesting designs.

","Prior to this, I had only watched two of Miyazaki's celebrated animated features - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997) and SPIRITED AWAY (2001), though when I was in Hollywood recently I missed out on TCM's retrospective of his work - and, as with those films, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (which, incidentally, I had failed to catch on the big screen when it premiered during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, due to all the shows being sold-out!) is a great showcase of the Japanese master's visionary genius; however, it also features his typical faults - to me, at least - of presenting an over-ambitious (and overly weird) plot line which, due to its excessive length, tends to overstay its welcome and ends up in being an overwhelming (if not necessarily memorable) visual experience! As usual the detail is immaculate and the scale of the whole thing impressive - but what really holds the film together, for me, are the amiable anthropomorphic characters (Turnip the Scarecrow, Calcifer the Fire Demon and Heen the Dog) rather than the 'human' leads, the villains, or even the elements of fantasy so prevalent in this particular film-maker's admittedly unique brand of art."

","Howwl's Moving Castle is a good movie that could have very easily been great. The animation was excellent, the voice acting (and casting) was fantastic, and for the most part of the film, the story was very good. The ending, however, just didn't make any sense. I have not read the novel (by Diana Wynne Jones) that the film is based on, and as much of the story that the film did convey is going to get me to check out the novel. I am betting that the cutting that was done was HUGE.<br/><br/>I thought the PG rating was a little much, I'm fairly sure I've seen 'G' ratings with more objectionable material. Still well worth checking out, maybe not for those who are not fans of anime and animation."
"nobbytatoes","7","1","3","14 March 2006"," such beautiful artistry
","Working in a fashionable hat shop, Sofie feels under-appreciated, yet she's to shy to change. Talk has been spread of sightings of Howl's moving castle. While walking down a back street, Sofie unexpectedly meets this mysterious Howl. People have known Howl as a vicious wizard that eats pretty girls hearts. Though the wizard Sofie meets is a confident, care wizard. That night, Sofie also meets the Witch of the Waste; a vain and selfish witch, places a curse upon Sofie, cursing her with the body of a ninety year old woman. Desperately to have the curse lifted, Sofie travels across the country. Meeting a strange scarecrow, Sofie soon finds herself upon Howl's moving castle. The legged castle is a rusted, decrepit place, which looks to fall to pieces in any given moment. Here she meets Calcifer, a fire demon who is also under a curse, and a young boy Markl, a training wizard.<br/><br/>With the success of Hayao Miyazaki's last film Spirited Away, it was a hard step for him to make a film to equal that wonderful film. While you shouldn't really just compare Howl's Moving Castle just against Spirited Away; though it doesn't come to it, Howl's Moving Castle is one of the weaker films from Hayao Miyazaki. Based upon the book by Diana Wynne Jones, the story of Howl's Moving Castle seems inconsistent, jumping around to much, making an uneven flow. When an important piece of information is told, the scene jumps somewhere else. The story starts very clear, yet during the later half of the film the story seems muddled and abit chaotic from the strangeness that Miyazaki presents.<br/><br/>Though the story of Howl's Moving Castle does hinder the film somewhat, it's the artistry that really creates this film. Much like many of Miyazaki's film, the world he is presenting to us is so out of this world; inhabited by some outlandish characters, wizards and demons. What so impressive about the animation is the handcrafted style, where animations are so heavily made with computer animation. The warmth just emanates from the screen, and you can see so much sweat and blood went into the vibrant detail.<br/><br/>While Howl's Moving Castle isn't one of the better films from Hayao Miyazaki, it's still a very impressive film all the same. You can't help but be drawn into this beautiful world."
"LupinsGal2004","9","1","3","11 March 2006"," It was definitely brilliant, flawed but brilliant
","I'd have to say I really enjoyed this movie. Just as much as I enjoyed Spirited away. Graphically it was stunning. Storywise it was pretty good. its the kind of brilliance you've come to expect from a Miyazaki film.<br/><br/>Its definitely easier to count the ways it IS like the Howl's Moving Castle novel by Diana Jones than the ways that it isn't, because aside from the characters- and the two subplots where Sophie is turned old by the witch of waste, and the way Calcifer is bound to Howl, the movie and the book are very different story wise, and other character wise. Even character personality wise.<br/><br/>At first I thought that would be a bad thing, but now, its not. Now the two can stand alone without being compared to one another. I kind of like that idea. Saves the heated debates you see with the Harry Potter movies for example. lol.<br/><br/>The casting was very good. Especially in Japanese. The English cast was pretty good, but I could not grow to like the English voice for Sophie. The voice for young Sophie seemed way too old for her, it sounded like a thirty year old voice in an 18 year old body kind of thing. the voice was too loud, too deep, the British accent, while I believe the actress is British, it sounded almost fake it was so over enunciated. it didn't grow on me. but other than that, it was great casting.<br/><br/>Its a very good movie as long as you don't expect to be seeing Diana Jone's book come to life. the two are pretty different. but in a good way. Its a stunning artistic work from Miyazaki and its got a little bit of everything. Romance, action, comedy, drama and while the two are very different, there are little nods to the novel that inspired the film. there are some confusing ""How did, when did and why did that happen"" moments in the movie, but I noticed that in Spirited Away and Only Yesterday. So it must be a Miyazaki thing. ^_^ 9 out of 10."
"jplatten","8","1","3","10 March 2006"," Hah! Forget computers! ...CGI is so last year.
","I remember when I saw Red's Dream. That's one of Pixar's first shorts along with Luxor Junior, and I remember it because I was working in a computer graphics company in the UK and it was about 1986 ish. We all huddled round a small TV and watched awed as raindrops fell outside the bike shop (Red is a unicycle) and hit the puddles, rippling out and distorting the reflection of the shop lights. It was a magical moment where we first saw that never seen before water effect and all went ""Wow"".<br/><br/>...Hey mac. What about Howl's Moving Castle - What's your point? Move it along! Ahem, well... The animation in Howl's is of frankly awesome quality. I'm bleating about CGI water above and then I go and see Howl's and there are waves coming up the beach in one scene and they are translucent, perfect and get this ...hand drawn! There is just something about the craft involved in replicating an effect like that with a pencil and some colourists. No it's not CGI style realistic. It's better than that. There is sometimes a thing about CGI in that it is too perfect. That's why companies try hard to top Toy Story. Great movie but everything is so round, hard and shiny.<br/><br/>The water in Howl's is like a poem about water rather than a slavish copy and therein lies the difference. ...Something like the essential difference between a painting and a photograph.<br/><br/>That's just one item in one scene and things like that go on throughout the movie and my eyes just basically got wider and wider. I find the whole thing just astonishing and really must look up the other movies like Spitited Away and Princess Mononoke. To paraphrase another reviewer. (This ain't CGI) ""This is Art"".<br/><br/>Ah... but you wanted to watch a film really didn't you? It works well enough but I'm going to have to give it an 8 instead of a 10. Quite simply there is something that probably makes sense in Japanese that goes wrong here and makes the story a little puzzling and disjointed in English in places. Other than that it's great. You'll continue to see some scenes in your mind's eye for months afterwards. This movie is not easily forgotten. (And my 12 year old daughter thought it was great too!)"
"eagleknight98","8","1","3","25 June 2005"," A bit less than anticipated
","I guess I will start my short review by saying that I am a huge fan of Miyazaki since the 70's that is why I rushed to watch this movie. The movie, in short, is about a girl with low self esteem and poor self image. It is also about a selfish, egoistic and pampered boy who is too indulged with his beauty sometimes. Then fate brings those two, along with a lot of marvelous characters, together in a motivating, breathtaking adventure where each and everyone learns there weakness and strength through the other. Perhaps i was a little biased with the last two lines, because that is how i hoped it would be... The story line is somewhat weak, and if you watch it once, might look purposeless. The animation was great, but less than what he has achieved in Spirited Away. The English dubbing was good, yet weak when it comes to the fire spirit and the heroin. Overall: The movie is worth watching once in the cinema. And it is definitely worth getting the DVD to add it to the Miyazaki collection and to pay attention to those minor, yet powerful, details that one can never catch from watching the movie once."
"kane_1371-117-231060","5","1","4","1 August 2014"," Hayao Miyazaki strikes another Nausicaa of the valley of the wind
","While you would be considered a mad man to call Hayao Miyazaki anything less than a master and a genius you can not expect him to be a ""Joe Hisaishi"" meaning that being able to craft masterpieces one after another. This review will contain some spoiler from the book and the movie.<br/><br/>Some of you probably wonder what it means when I say Miyazaki strikes another Nausicaa but give the movie 5 stars, well Howl's Moving Castle is another disappointment to me. Nausicaa, Hayao's own story was butchered by Hayao so I couldn't expect much when it came to some one else's story. Now let me be the nail that can not be hammered down with the praises this movie wrongfully receives.<br/><br/>When I first thought about writing my review I was thinking to start with this line ""Come one, come all and witness your favorite childhood story being murdered in the most horrific way possible"". Well I changed my mind. While I do not think that the movie version of Howl's moving castle is by any means a good movie I do not think that it is the worst thing out there either.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle that Hayao Miyazaki created surely is a bold move, it was taking on an already well known work and was destined to be faced with lots of nostalgic and overly obsessed fans and maybe that is why the movie is so weird and different from the original book. I mean sure Hayao Miyazaki's worlds have always been weird but you could explain them easily (except Nausicaa's movie) but with Howl's Moving Castle he took a step over the border to the gaga land.<br/><br/>Howl's moving castle is beautiful, colorful and alive but it is also uninspiring and a re-skin version of Miyazaki's other movies. I believe that to escape the comparison between the book and the movie Miyazaki decided to create a retelling of the story which is loosely based on the book.<br/><br/>The movie is emotional and the beautiful soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi helps you feel the emotions even better however that is all the movie is. A big 2 hour long Japanese anime filled with emotions that are not even justified. Sophie falls in love with Howl in no time, feels sad for him, tries to save him and saves him. Is Sophie a complex character? Well she used to be but then Japan's Walt Disney decided to turn her into a shallow character that we get nothing from but sobbing, smiling and calling Howl's name constantly. Is she heroic? well not really, is she the depressed character in the book? nope she is fine. She is a very normal person, she can actually even switch between her old grandma state to a little bit less older woman and the 19 year old girl state on the get go. The character is never believable and you do not really feel for her. You really do not feel for anyone of them. The story also does not help here. You already know that I am disappointed with the movie being so different from the original work but I would have been fine if we had received something like Akira in which you at least get some story line, even the weak story line that Nausicaa of the valley of the wind had would be fine but we get nothing. There is a war going on (going ahead of the books are we Miyazaki sensei?) and since this is a Miyazaki movie we must have that anti war message too but OK still there must be a place for improvement right? WRONG! That's it. A war is going on, everything else is just there. Witch of the waste? pfft, she is not the real villain she was just there to put the curse on Sophie for the sake of the plot, I am sure Miyazaki would rather had her not be a part of the movie just like Martha, Sulliman, Prince Justin of Ingary!!!, Howl's place of birth WALES! and other stuff like magic and stuff, who wants that right? All that matters here is the war that is going on and how bad it is. Howl is not really worried about the Witch of the Waste that 5 minutes in the movie sends a curse for him through Sophie, he is more concerned with the bombed cities of the coast lines. Howl does not fight a magic duel with Witch of the Waste in Porthaven instead fights a legion of flying creatures that once were wizards but subjugated themselves to the king (if you do not see how bizarre this movie is I don't know what more to write) and Mrs. Pentstemmon, Woops I meant Madame Sulliman. We do not read about Sophie's emotional struggles with being the oldest and being cursed and also jealous because Howl is a pimp but we get a 10 second scene in which Sophie goes under the rain and cries after Howl's outburst with slime but it is resolved as I said in 10 seconds when ""Markl"" comes to deliver the message that Howl needs help. By the way why is ""Markl"" a kid here? was it too hard to keep him a teenager? There is no way to feel any connection with any of these characters, Markl is underdeveloped, Howl is underdeveloped, Sophie is just there for no reason and the list goes on.<br/><br/>You can not believe that this is a movie by the guy that made Spirited Away. As I said the scenery is beautiful and even though I would rather have the castle from the book, movie's castle is interesting too and the music by Joe Hisaishi is just perfect but that is all this movie has got for it."

","At first i had no idea that this film had existed until on my older brother came home with it day. My first impressions were ""oooh joy another film that would probably be boring"" But that all changed when i sat down and watched it; it just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover and that goes for films too. I found the animation was brilliant it's bright, colourful; i especially love the scenes on the mountain tops, Star Lake, and th Royal City; even Howls bedroom is colourful with all the antiques! The film truly does capture the audiences' imagination and pulls them into the film. The characters expressions and talent voices from Christain Bale, Jean Simmons, etc are truly great and so is the story! If you need to watch a good movie filled with all sorts and is an animation then this is the film for you i can't stop watching it even to this day!!!! So from me enjoy 10 star"
"yipidee","6","1","4","25 June 2006"," Not terrible, but Miyazaki's worst.
","I honestly believe a lot of people think that if they don't enjoy a Miyazaki film they're wrong, and therefore say it's great no matter what. This film is the best example of it, I think this is easily his worst film to date. I admire the things he attempted to do to change the animation style, but I don't think all of it works, the movement of the castle, for example, I didn't really like.<br/><br/>Basic plot: Little girl becomes old woman and moves in with a wizard in a walking castle.<br/><br/>I've read the book, and wanted a closer adaptation. Miyazaki's Howl is not the same as the book's though he reproduces one scene from the book that doesn't really fit the Howl of the film. The story changes weren't really for the better, but the film mostly stands on its own feet. The ending doesn't work as unless you've read the book you will be unaware of certain aspects of Sophie's character.<br/><br/>For someone who'd read the book, calcifer will be a disappointment I feel. Just too childish in the film. The added war themes are pretty clumsy compared to Porco Rosso, or Mononoko etc. but the message is still positive.<br/><br/>I watched the Japanese subtitled version, which has English completely different to the dubbed track! Odd! The dubbed calcifer is better than the Japanese one, but the Japanese track is better in all other respects.<br/><br/>This film shouldn't be the first Gibhli one you look into, but if you've liked others give it a try."
"frolockingwith311","9","1","4","5 June 2006"," Great movie but a little lacking.
","Howls moving castle is an instant classic, added to Miyazakis long list of classic animations. The story is great, the animation is great, and the voice acting is great. The one thing that is holding this title back from getting a perfect score for me was that it lacks the huge emotional peek at the end when everything comes together. The movie is great and the ending is great without it, but there is room for improvement. I felt that it came to a close much to abruptly.<br/><br/>Along with most animated movies the action or emotion always peeks at the very end of the movie. During this particular one, even though everything comes together at the end, the climax came up short of thrilling. I was entertained throughout the whole movie by the mystical world that i was grabbed by. Characters although sometimes confusing, were very well done and left a good impression on me."
"e-70733","6","1","5","6 June 2018"," An overrated work
","In this film, director Hayao Miyazaki overly focused on the design of the romantic plot. In addition, the expression of the anti-war theme is not entirely based on the script, and it is somewhat self-talking.
Therefore, although the movie is full of various visual wonders, due to the relatively immature handling of drama conflicts, all this lacks a platform that can truly release emotions. In the end, this story full of narrative ambition and various complex metaphors ended up in a random private reconciliation of several major characters. Compared with Miyazaki's best work, what the film lacks is really deep thinking and brave expression."

","Hello,<br/><br/>I saw this movie and was reminded of comments that Miazaki made when he was here a few years ago promoting Spirited Away.

","I am going to do something that I haven't to this point done, in my IMDb history. I am going to point out a trend I have noticed on this website and possibly ridicule some of the opinions of other IMDb contributors. I do realize this is not normal and believe it may be due to the 80 hours or so I am going to complete this week at work and my lack of cranberry juice or Nutella spread for this morning's bagel breakfast spread. That is like spitting on a man ablaze. First of all, you are spitting on someone. Secondly, the ludicrously small amount of water in the spit couldn't put out a match (of course unless you are a spit marksman, in which case I apologize). And finally, you ARE spitting on someone. That is how I felt about this movie. I was actually hoping Miyazaki could help me out in my temporal predicament, as he had done many times in the past. With hopeful enthusiasm, my confidence and trust of my fellow humans deteriorated to the point of despair and disdain. I realize I should probably sleep on this topic before writing a review, but here we are. <br/><br/>The trend in question involves the best of the user comments. I have noticed that many of the under performing movies' (in my opinion) top listings all praise these movies. That is not that strange. What is strange is that these top listings usually are contributed by ""authors"" with 20 or fewer contributions (a bunch of them are in the single digits). Is this some form of gorilla marketing ? A devoted single-serving, nom de plum for Shakespeare's modern living legacy or something completely different? It is not for me to decide, but merely to point out a perceived pattern.<br/><br/>This movie is a clear indicator of the above patterns. It took to #11th best comment to get the first ""prolific author"" (only in the teens), who saw it as a disappointing 7/10 film. I would love to be that disappointed. It would make this day for me seem like drinking warm soda on a hot day. It took to the #14 best comment to get the first true prolific author, who didn't actually see this movie with the original Japanese audio. This duality, this contradiction permeates the movie and it's fans as well. For me it is hard to reconcile. Outside of my current state of being (in which case it is the proverbial straw on the posterior of a dromedary), I would have found this movie comparable to a lukewarm bath. It's not annoying or cold enough to get out, yet not hot enough to want to stay in longer or build a summer home there. With Miyazaki mediocrity is not expected, but here we are.<br/><br/>The world is a Victorian-like Era complete with WWI/WWII like technology powered by steam and various non-nuclear fuels. Victorian covers everything from the structures, the clothes, the technology and even the behaviors. Its turn of the century European influence is quite pronounced. At the same time it is part European and it is also part Japanese, but in more subtle ways. <br/><br/>A young, insecure hat maker's apprentice (Sofî) stumbles upon a magician and his situation, quite by accident while walking on the streets at night. This leads to the Witch of the Waste cursing her with old age. She seems to get older and younger over the course of the movie. I am not sure if this is due to the nature of the curse or if she is affecting the spell itself, with her emotions and thoughts. Maybe it is just a colossal film continuation blunder. I don't know. I do know it was very distracting along with Sofî herself. She then finds the wizards again (Hauru, a.k.a. Howl) and decides to hire herself as the house-keeper of his multidimensional castle. She also makes a deal with the boiler (a.k.a, Karushifâ, Calcipher ; a fire spirit holding the castle together and source of Hauru's power) to help her dispel the curse. <br/><br/>I had a hard time connecting with most of the characters, their motivation and the story (especially the main characters). It was an amalgamate of contradiction. It is a movie that takes its time to build up the story and characters, yet ends in a quick breeze complete with a nicely tied red satin bow. It wants to be a love story, built upon loneliness, insecurity, chance and proximity, yet expressed in the juvenile form. I felt like an adult watching a kid's movie or better yet watching an alien trying to emulate human behavior or thought, but never personally experiencing it. It felt contrived. Logical steps seems to skip, as if human motivation is a mere trite and the result is all that is important.<br/><br/>The animation is the only saving grave of this movie. The style, color and attention to detail is amazing. This world is alive, even though our protagonists are cardboard cut outs of real people. This world is so character shallow that wars are started and ended as simply as one would bite into a cookie. I love the idea, layout and detail of Hauru's moving residence. It is in the title of movie and deservingly so. The most memorable character of the movie would have to be Karushifâ and unfortunately his story takes a side-quest to the main story : Sofî and Hauru. The rest is cute and simplistic. It strives to be deep, yet when we examine the evidence of the inner meaning it is bare or non-existing. These ""people"" don't live, they just follow a life trajectory. If you like floating around through life, not interested in what is going on around you, then this movie might resonate with you. I on the other hand, would like to believe there are things and people yet to see along my path to wherever."

","One of my most memorable screenings of the last 20 years has been attending the lone screening which took place in my area at the local ""Art House"" cinema of Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle.

For the first time in all my viewings at cinemas,I stood in a line which went half-way down the street,picked up a lovely Inglorious Custards cocktail,and got set to witness Howl's castle moving again.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Guided by living scarecrow ""Turnip Head"" into Howl's moving castle, writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki greets Sophie to a magnificence Steam Punk design,whistling from the 80 individual 19th century machinery segments agitating each other with every movement of the castle's legs shifting on a bustling sound of hot steam and fragile wooden foundations.produced digitally that transfers the 1400 storyboards of the hand-drawn backgrounds and the characters into a digital medium, Miyazaki pens the styles together with his distinctive stylisation.<br/><br/>Blossoming from the fluid animation sparkling in a beautiful vibrancy on the detailed,expressive character designs and razor sharp editing wrapping the audience in a soaring flight of fantasy atmosphere,Miyazaki sharpens the digital 3D rendering on the moving castle in a contrasting style, via the digital animation of the building sending it rolling along the silky hand-drawn backdrop. Adapting Diana Wynne Jones novel when he wanted to express his anger over the Iraq war, Miyazaki travels up the stairs to Madame Suliman's remote palace, who at a safe distance from the effects, shatters the floor with a all-consuming viciousness in keeping conflicts in a abrasive state.<br/><br/>Turning Sophie into a 90 year old, Miyazaki continues to brilliantly build upon his theme of the lead breaking out from primary focusing on themselves,in this case Sophie spreading a compassion to the residences of the moving castle,and even to the witch who cursed her. Initially scared of her old age appearance, Miyazaki threads his themes of compassion and a hatred of war with his recurring motif of a feminist aspect,lit in Sophie finding a solution to the war with a brave thoughtfulness against the volatile masculinity of Howl within his moving castle."

","I have to say that in the likes of Inside Out and Zootopia, I enjoyed this movie so much despite how flawed it seems compared to other films from Studio Ghibli. The animation is just what we expect from Ghibli, matching the character designs with the backgrounds and scenes very well, in a way that seemingly only anime-style can pull off. The characters are fascinating to hear and watch, and have very interesting stories, all rounding up in a way that each of them make the film balanced in its list of characters. The story flops in some spots, but it holds up very strong in plenty of places, and most of the time I barely noticed potential flaws since I was still recovering from what had occurred beforehand. Studio Ghibli has proved once again that animation is for all to cherish for lifetimes, and compared to plenty of other 2004 animated films (besides The Incredibles and maybe Shrek 2), this is top tier stuff that you don't want to miss. Anyone who tells you to skip this film (besides Miyazaki fans who have seen a majority if not all of these films) clearly is only jealous of how much Miyazaki has implanted himself into critics' minds and has made ""animation"" not synonymous with ""cartoon""."

","I really appreciate Miyazaki's story-telling and the unique perspective he brings to the world of children's films, and Howl's Castle is no exception. Although it is based on a book (which I have not read), Miyazaki really makes the story his own. The world he crafts and the story he weaves are so amazingly detailed and interesting that I was truly spellbound for most of the film. Unfortunately, the ending does not live up to the promise of the film and is somewhat unsatisfying, which is the only reason I could not rate this as a 10. However, it is still worth seeing. As is typical with Miyazaki, he successfully relates the conflict and ambiguity of the world around us in an engaging way, without resorting to the Western ideals of good and evil. His characters really embody the concepts of yin/yang and wabi-sabi. Nothing and no one is completely good or completely evil and nothing is really as it may seem. I think these are concepts that all children (and adults) should be introduced to and I can't think of a better way than through a tale told by Miyazaki."

","This and 'Spirited Away' are quite possibly the two most well recognized Anime films ever made. Hayao Miyazaki is just one of those film makers that attracts all sorts of people regardless if those people like the style or not. His films are bright, vibrant, and stuffed with sci-fi type elements. 'Howls Moving Castle' is no exception to this. We start off with our main character, Sofi, being turned into a very elderly woman. Not wanting anyone to see her like this she runs away from home and becomes a maid for the mysterious wizard Howl. And now we have our movie.<br/><br/>Just like all of Miyazaki's films this is absolutely breathtaking to look at. The hand drawn style is great on its own, but it's the detail in the world that is so impressive. Whether it's Howls gigantic moving castle that is made up of many different moving parts or the bustling streets, it's hard to be sucked in by the world.<br/><br/>It's beautiful, bright, and filled with color. Which was nice to see considering the amount of films these days that are very bleak and void of color or life. It set the tone for the rest of the film as a fun but kind of dark tale. What really springs this world off the screen is the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Each song is undeniably unique and perfect for each scenario in the film. It's an excellent score that doesn't force the film on you. Hayao understands that the majority of the audience can recognize subtly. So, unlike many other films, he uses the music to accent what is being seen on screen. Not to try and force you how to think or feel in a particular scene. <br/><br/>All this helps the film move along at a shockingly brisk pace. The film is two hours long but goes by in no time at all. This has a lot to do with the previous elements that I mentioned. Really the only times it slowed was when characters decided to just spew exposition. I understand that some children need things to be spelled out for them considering that this is a kids movie but by doing this the film doesn't have any interesting characters.<br/><br/>It says this character is like this and they are like that. It kind of sucks that the majority of the film is smart about not pushing things in your face but it doesn't even try with the characters. Instead of showing you who they are it just blatantly tells you. Then they don't really behave the way the film says they should.<br/><br/>This happens with the story as well. It says OK we are going to do this and then this. And I can't help think that the characters they are talking to already know this. The only people that don't know what these characters are talking about is us. At that point it's fairly obvious that the film is no longer having the characters talk to each but to us instead.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that children's movies have to have the same complex characters of 'Prisoners' but this film doesn't even try. It will say one thing but not give us any indication of who that person actually is through their actions. It makes some of the motives in the film very unclear. It's a shame that the film couldn't simply write consistent story and characters because this film could've been one of the best. It's animation, voice cast, and original ideas are enough to get one through but don't expect much more than that."

","Rated PG for frightening images and brief mild language.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is one of my absolute favorite films of all time. The art work is stunning, the movie kept me entertained even when it got slow, and this film is relatively age-appropriate for younger viewers. One thing about this film concerned me and it was the scariness of the bad guys in the film. There is also some false spiritual elements in the film that may concern certain viewers. Other than that, Howl's Moving Castle is a must-see for the entire family that viewers of almost all ages can enjoy. <br/><br/>Createology"

","OVERALL: 8/10 STORY: 7/10 ANIMATION: 10/10 SOUND: 7/10 CHARACTER: 8/10 ENJOYMENT: 7/10<br/><br/>This is the third Miyazaki's movie I have seen. Totoro and Spirited Away were definitely better, but I'm not gonna judge this movie based on this. It was just a little side note.<br/><br/>The story I really liked the fact I've never seen another anime or movie with the same plot. I appreciate the fact it is original. But what bothered me was the fact there was too many things going on. For me, it was too many information to take in. And, in my opinion, sometimes the story was all over the place. It was a little bit confusing for just a movie. If it were an anime I would have understood the multitude of information to take in. But just for a movie, it's just too much.<br/><br/>The art Well, the art is the thing I enjoy the most when it comes to Miyazaki's work. It's splendid. I can't express in words how much I love it. Even if one of his movies were terrible, I will still watch it just for the art.<br/><br/>The sound I really don't know what to say about the sound. The voice acting is great as it is in every anime or movie I know. As far as I can recall. I only give it a 7/10 because the ending song isn't my cup of tea.<br/><br/>The characters Well, the characters were all lovely in each unique way. Except Madame Sulliman. I don't really liked her. My favorite one is Calcifer and I kinda liked Turnip Head too. I don't know why. He didn't say much, but I think it's because he reminds me of No Face from Spirited Away. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, even if the story was a little off-putting at times. But for me, it's one of those movies I like to watch one time. I don't think I'll watch it again in the near future."

His voice was unbelievable and of course all of the other actors were great at their voices too!<br/><br/>I honestly loved the Flame guy Calcifer and he was voiced by the legend Billy Crystal! I was shocked, he didn't sound like Mike from Monsters Inc at all, he sounded like himself really.

","Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderful movie for all ages. It took me a few times of watching it to really understand what the movie was about and what was going on, but it makes a really good point. You really need to not take things for granted and you should live your life. I thought this movie was excellent at its use of imagery and details. It used a lot of creative examples of real-life events and issues that correlate to our world, and that's what I like to see. Yes, live your life how you want to and be who you want to, but don't let others try to control you and how you look or who you are on the inside--or outside. In the end, it's really what you make out of it. Seeing things that I could relate to really helped me as well, so I got think of it that way. At first, I kind of thought it was a little similar to the Wizard of Oz, but it's not really like that at all. You can see what I mean if you have seen both, but that confused me at first. So if you get confused by watching this movie the first time, just try to process it another way, or watch it again. It will really help you out. It is a little harder to understand, but you'll get it. Watching this movie taught me this and I hope that it inspires you to feel the same way."

","Howl's moving castle. <br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki is truly in a league of his own. His fantasy, tedious attention to details, unpredictable and gripping style all make his work stand out. And what I mean by stand out is that it really captivates you, every scene makes you demand for more and at the same time wonder how could one think of something this surreal. Yet, no matter how surreal, vivid, and sometimes outright ridiculous Miyazaki might seem at times, his work is still full of valuable lessons, meaningful comparisons and fairy tale-like emotions. Howl's moving castle is no different.<br/><br/>Our antagonist is a hat maker Sophie, who, due to a spell had been turned into an old woman, and a brave young wizard named Howl, who constantly spends his time in a constantly moving castle, powered by a quirky little ball of fire named Calcifer, who itself is a part of Howl's heart. Howl's moving castle takes us on a beautiful, thrilling and breathtaking journey that introduces us to some of the funniest and bizarre characters a viewer would expect to see. All the characters however are there for a reason and each little story, from Sophie helping the witch that cast the spell on her to Howl constantly running away from his problems, are there to teach us a lesson. But not in the kind of a way Madagascar or Ice Age would. Miyazaki really forces us to think and come to our own conclusions. I think this is the essence of all truly great films – everyone takes lessons of their own out of them.<br/><br/>Howl's moving castle, like most Moyazaki's films, is a true work of art. The plot is thrilling, unpredictable, subtly funny and remarkably original. The animations are stunning. The details in every scene will leave you dazzled and amazed, to say the least. The classical music soundtrack, that is constantly fading in and out is perfectly in tune with the beautiful style and scenery. <br/><br/>Yet again, Hayao Miyazaki manages to raise the bar on what true animation and story telling is really about. A near perfect film."

","I understand that many people consider Spirited Away to be Hayao Miyazaki's finest work, but I disagree. Though it was spectacular and amazing to watch ( a great pioneer in the world of animation) I prefer the story of Howl's Moving Castle. A young hat maker is cursed into becoming a old woman after meeting a mysterious stranger known as Howl. She soon discovers his walking ""castle"" and the creatures it holds. As she gets to know this mysterious man more and more she becomes younger and younger but also has to save Howl from the evil witch who cursed her in the first place.

I was a fan from about 15 minutes in, very good voice casting, the music score is brilliant, and the lasting appeal was evident when my kids were watching it again the very next morning. The story was very good, kept me anxious to see what happened next. Each character is mysterious enough to get you to want to explore what more there is to them. There is plenty of beautiful scenes where the color and the landscapes pull you in, and for a brief time, engulf you in the splendor of the story. I would recommend this to anyone who is relatively new to anime movies, this one is safe for kids. Mine are 10 and 6 and both loved it. My oldest even requested the Howl's Moving Castle paperback for Christmas this year."
"benneari0","10","0","1","10 December 2014"," Amazing movie!
","Howl's Moving Castle is absolutely my favorite movie, and all of it – the story, characters, animation, soundtrack – is amazingly beautiful and imaginative. The story starts out with Sophie, a shy, innocent 18 year old girl who works in her mother's hat shop. Sophie happens into the notoriously charming magician, Howl. Voiced by Christian Bale, Howl is wanted by the King to help fight during the war as Howl evades his henchmen at all costs. When Sophie gets a terrible curse placed on her by a powerful witch, she goes searching for something to break the curse and ends up working as the cleaning lady in Howl's fantastical moving castle. She learns more and more about Howl, and the terrible things he is running away from. Together, with their ragtag team of friends including the King's dog and a fire demon, they seek freedom from their individual afflictions and help save each other along the way.<br/><br/>The scenery has amazing detail, all the way from character's costumes, to landscape, to buildings. One of the most detailed scenes is in Howl's room, which is stocked wall to wall with imaginative magical items. The landscape scenes in the waste are also very beautiful, with deer running alongside the castle through open fields next to a lake with a gorgeous blue sky. When Howl's apprentice Markl (voiced by Josh Hutcherson) and Sophie have a picnic by a lake, the detail and artistic talent in the scene is amazing – pink and yellow flowers surround their table, the water ripples in the slight breeze over the field, there's a little island in the lake with pine trees on it, all as storm clouds roll in over the lake. The obviously talented animation department for Howl's Moving Castle is another reason why the movie is a must-see.<br/><br/>All major characters show awesome development as well. Sophie starts out as a very meek girl, and by the end of the movie she's really come out of her shell in a multitude of ways. Howl and Calcifer (the fire demon) also develop immensely, while battling demons both within themselves and without. Without giving too much away, I can guarantee each character is very interesting and dynamic, which just furthers the intricacies of the plot and makes you that much more invested in the story.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is my favorite from any movie; however, all Studio Ghibli films have awesome music. Actually, my study playlist is about 99% music from Studio Ghibli films. It's all originally composed for the movie by a full orchestra. Although almost all of the songs are purely instrumental, they tell the story just as well as if they had lyrics. My favorite song from the film is ""Stroll Through The Sky"", which plays when Sophie and Howl are literally strolling through the sky (who would've thought) using Howl's magic. The song is very uplifting and majestic, which matches the scene with Sophie and Howl hopping from rooftop to building spires to just waltzing above the busy street.<br/><br/>While this is my favorite movie, to someone who's never seen a Miyazaki film it can be very daunting I think. A lot of plot points kind of require you to just accept them as truths since these movies are so imaginative, without going into much scientific explanation. For example, it's never explained why or how there are multitudes of witches and wizards just living around normal people, or why they're so politically involved. A major part of the movie is the moving castle that Howl and the others live in, and beyond learning that it's Calcifer's magic that moves the castle, no further explanation is given to how or why the castle exists. If you're the type of person who needs an explanation for things in movies, you might want to avoid this one. If you can get past it and accept things without much information regarding those things, then you should definitely enjoy this movie, and any Miyazaki movie, really.<br/><br/>In case you're unfamiliar with Studio Ghibli movies, particularly those directed by legend Hayao Miyazaki, they always feature amazing scenery, both in it's actual beauty, talent, and visual complexities as well as in it's unique and imaginative details. While a lot of Studio Ghibli movies are suitable to younger watchers, they are always highly engaging for older audience members as well – all of them are complex, with intricate plots and wide ranges of human emotions and situations. Howl's Moving Castle is one of the more adult movies, not as much as say Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, but definitely more than Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. Howl's Moving Castle definitely delivers on all fronts – creative, funny, imaginative, compelling, dark, as well as uplifting. Whether you're a seasoned Miyazaki fan, or haven't seen a single Studio Ghibli movie, I would definitely recommend Howl's Moving Castle."

","First to note: This is probably one of the best English VA'd Miyazaki films, especially for Calcifer (who is portrayed perfectly by Billy Crystal.) Anyway, this is another solid Miyazaki film, though probably not his best. The film begins with a character named Sophie in another magical world. There is a French commune undertone in the city. She is transformed into a very old woman and learns to live with her problems by living in well, a magical Moving Castle with Howl, Calcifer, and Markl. The plot becomes convoluted by the end but overall, it's the relationship between these characters that makes the film what it is.<br/><br/>However, the villain is a bit underwhelming here, the oddity between Calcifer, the Witch, and Howl is strange, and the ending has a deus ex machina feel to it. At least past the scene at the King's castle, the movie feels quite rushed as well which results in the ending feeling a bit too weak compared to his other films.<br/><br/>As with most of Ghibli's films, it deals with the environment. The main girl is also older than in many of other Miyazaki films, being in her late teens rather than early or younger like in other films. It is overall different but similar, but not the best of either type.<br/><br/>7.7"

","I liked this one even better than Princess Mononoke, as it maintained the focus on its main character far longer than the latter (which lost itself in the greater plot.) Visually stunning, I quickly found myself wishing to visit the magical vision of Europe that Miyazaki provides.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the cross between steampunk and fantasy, we're introduced to a semi-industrial city on the borders of a rugged, green waste. Sophie is a young, plain girl who works in a hat-shop, and is, entirely by accident, caught up in the affairs of wizards when a mysterious stranger rescues her from a pair of churlish soldiers. Soon after this Sophie is assaulted by a jealous witch. Left with the fall-out of this encounter, Sophie refuses to feel sorry for herself, but sets off into the waste to remedy the problem, where she meets a number of eccentric characters. Romance ensues.<br/><br/>From a character standpoint, Sophie is a marvelous heroine, providing a down-to-earth contrast to the beautiful, self-important wizard Howl, though the romance between the two did not quite convince me (her falling for him made much more sense than vice versa), much like that of Mononoke. I think this would have worked better if Howl had been given more character scenes, he was a little bit too idealized and feminine (Manic Pixie Dream Boy?). The whole relationship felt like Jane Eyre opposite a more perfect Mr. Rochester. But quibbles aside, it's still a lot of fun, incredibly creative and beautiful. Miyazaki, once again, thoroughly wowed me with his sumptuous visuals. I'll be watching again."

","Having read the book of the same name when I was younger, it really had a huge impact on me; Diana Wynne Jones is probably my favourite childhood author. And Howl's Moving Castle was– still is one of my favourite books from her and having read it more times than I can remember, my imagination has come up with a different way to visualize the story. So as the film is really different, it did not really affect the way I imagined the book to be. That being said, though I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki (director and screenplay), I feel that they should have stuck to the book more instead of creating a totally different world.<br/><br/>As characteristic of a Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki film, there are lots of expressionistic scenes as well as underlying messages. It has the feel of World War II and Nazi Germany, which could very well be what Miyazaki was going for (Sophie's town was based off a street in France) plus there was an actual war going on in the film. Some aspects too reminded me of Paprika a very expressionistic, confusing and intriguing film, which to this day, I have no idea what is about. This goes for Howl's Moving Castle, though not to the extent of Paprika. There are just some scenes or details in this film that I don't get the relevance to.<br/><br/>The character progression was well done, in that we could see the characters growing and maturing, as well as forming stronger bonds between each other. There were points in the film that seemed to slow down but it made it up with the fantastic visuals. The colours and everything were really stimulating and well defined.<br/><br/>I remember finding it weird that the book was made into a film by Studio Ghibli because the author is UK based and then I found it even more shocking when I heard that Disney bought over Studio Ghibli. Actually I just found that out. In 2014. How slow am I?

","I'm going through a sort of Miyazaki renaissance, in which this and ""Mononoke-hime"" (1997) have played a major part. I think I'll have to visit ""Majo no takkyûbin"" (1989) next to see if Miyazaki can turn my head around again. I don't tire of telling this over again: there's nothing as enlivening as returning to films and finding so much there that had gone unnoticed previously.<br/><br/>And I thought that ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" (2001) was the ultimate exploration of colour in Miyzaki's animation. How wrong was I! I can't believe, and couldn't believe, my eyes – every scene is so sumptuously and purposefully lit, allowing every detail bask in the glorious foreplay of light and shadow. The first five minutes are, as a sort of prelude, some greatly effective filmmaking: the beautifully detailed interiors, the everyday hustle and bustle of the townsfolk, the remarkable intimacy and homeliness of the narrow streets; the dank cloths, the oil lamps, the small, everyday objects laid to waste in the castle. <br/><br/>But what makes Miyazaki's film come alive is the heart. The heart of the film is not captive, but rather bursts through and frees Calcifer through Sophie. His characters often tread the line between light and darkness, and other opposites: youth and old age, beauty and ugliness, good and evil, night and day, blessing and curse, war and peace, life and death, freedom and captivity. It's through these opposites that the film comes alive, the characters often a kind of white space to which he pours the contradictory sentiments, coalesced by the narrative thrust where the same forces battle it out on a larger scale."

","From the writer-director of Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke & the Academy Award winning Spirited Away comes another spellbinding journey into the creative world of this highly revered filmmaker. Howl's Moving Castle continues the remarkable success streak of Hayao Miyazaki's esteemed film career & is a fascinating take on old age difficulties, futility of war & magic of love, all encapsulated with Miyazaki's unique storytelling ability & infused with his distinct artistic flavour.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle, on a superficial level, is a love story between Sophie; an unconfident young woman & Howl; a powerful but insecure wizard. When a witch, who's after Howl, casts a strong spell on Sophie which transforms her into a 90-year old woman, she moves out of town & travels to seek a cure for her spell and eventually finds shelter in Howl's strange & mobile castle. There she meets a fire demon amongst other acquaintances who offers to break her curse if Sophie is able to set him free from Howl's service.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Howl's Moving Castle features another intriguing drama that's effectively paced & expertly narrated by him. It also boasts a compelling set of characters amongst which Calcifer; the fire-demon, turned out to be the most interesting for me. Like all Miyazaki's films, the animation is impressive while the lush cinematography captures every moment in fine detail. The humour is nicely timed, the themes are elegantly explored & Joe Hisaishi's score wonderfully accompanies the whole drama with its blissful tracks.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Howl's Moving Castle may not rank amongst Miyazaki's finest works but this anime is still full of life, love, joy & magic. The only complaint I have is that the final 30 minutes are kind of messed up plus the ending feels slightly hurried up. Yet it doesn't take away much from the film as it still manages to transport its viewers to Miyazaki's wonderland and will surely leave most of them emotionally fulfilled & satisfied. Another visual wonder from start to finish by Studio Ghibli whose creativity never seems to tire out, Howl's Moving Castle is thoroughly recommended."

","I bought this on Blu-Ray along with the DVD 'My Neighbour Totoro' and while I think it's not the best of Miyazaki's films it still has a good storyline, amazing visuals and memorable characters. The design work of Howl's castle is very creative and steam punk-esque and the entire film has an amount of steam machinery such as cars, boats and trains etc. <br/><br/>The voice acting is pretty good and I was surprised that Disney/Pixar had casted Christian Bale as the male protagonist, I always try and come up with a Batman impression of him for his character just for the fun of it. The fantasy of the plot is good but it's really not his best film but granted it's still a watchable film by the visuals of the film."
"ThomasDrufke","9","0","1","29 April 2014"," Sweet and Charming Fantasy Adventure
","It's these types of movies that really define the fantasy genre. There's something about an animated movie that dives into your imagination that is more fascinating than actual people in a movie. Miyazaki is most definitely one of the most visually stunning directors that always seems to find the balance between great character development and large fantasy spectacle.<br/><br/>It's loads of fun and in my opinion easier to understand than Spirited Away. Perhaps it was because it wasn't my first time seeing Miyazaki's work this time around. To me this film feels a lot like the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. A man/creature who was put under a long spell ends up meeting the love of his life and they fight to try and resolve the everlasting issue. Although this time, the girl also has a spell placed upon her. There are great supporting characters as well, the turnip and the Calcifer are funny and sweet as helpers to Sophie along her journey.<br/><br/>The American voices were solid and I think everyone fit their character except for perhaps Christian Bale as Howl. Bale is one of my favorite actors but his deep and grim voice didn't particularly fit with the self indulgent Howl. Other than that it's a great journey and a memorable one. Although I think the film would have benefited from about a 15 min less runtime.<br/><br/>9.0/10"

","I like a lot of people who love the works of master animator, this movie was right up my alley. If you read many of my reviews you should know that I belittle movies for not being faithful or capturing the spirit of their source material, however I have not gotten around to reading this book so I'll just review the movie for how it is. <br/><br/>Like most movies Howl's Moving Castle follows the three act structure, and to be honest I had a different reaction of each of the movies acts. I really loved the first act. An insecure girl is stricken with old age by a witch so she becomes the cleaning lady for the infamous Wizard Howl. This follows the usual Miyazaki formula, a simple premise, likable characters and top it off with some of the best hand-drawn animation you'll ever see, by the way the movie was going I was looking forward to the rest of the movie. However I did love the first act I just like the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>The middle of the film some subplots drop their anchors and it started getting very needlessly confusing; Like how Howl was a lover with the witch of the wastes, and Howl as even worse self-esteem then Sophie (Hilarious scene, if you've seen you know what I'm talking about), Howl's hearts is lost or something, there is a witch who wants to take everyone's powers away and there was something about a war etc. Yeah like I said it get a lot more complicated then it needs to be.<br/><br/>By the time the third act rolled around it was just a mess. I have to many spoilers in here already so I'm not going to say anything about, like I said before if you have seen the movie you should know what I mean.<br/><br/>But with that said, even with it's problems aside the movie still has the magical, innocent, and heart-warming charm that only Hayao Miyazaki can deliver. I highly recommend it."

","This is one of my favorite anime movies of all times. I'm not a fan of English dubs of japan made anime movies but with this movie i was quite surprised with the quality that went into the English dub of the movie. As with all Studio Ghibli movies this one is a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The theme is magical and mystical and as it is with all Ghibli movies a bit on the dark side of humanity. Which is great in my book since people need to see our own mistakes and all Ghibli movies have a hidden (or not so hidden) message that they tell, be it ""war is bad"" or ""be good to nature"".<br/><br/>Both the main character and Howl, which is also kind of the main character are great with depth, that most Hollywood movies forget incorporate in their movies.<br/><br/>All in all a movie worth watching over and over again...

"lenii1337","8","0","1","31 December 2013"," This is another great film from Hayao Miyazaki
","Story: the story is about a girl named Sophie who gets turned into an old woman and ends up living with a wizard named Howl in his moving castle. The story is the only part I felt was lacking in this movie. Though I have to admit I see more flaws with the story after reading the book (even though I find the movie much better). Overall, I felt many of the war scenes were over-dramatized and left a lot of questions. There were also a lot of small things throughout that they could have done a better job at explaining. Even after watching the movie so many times I cannot fully explain some scenes and still have questions about the movie.<br/><br/>Animation: The animation is absolutely stunning and many of the backgrounds look realistic. I also have to say that I am impressed with how Sophie is animated, and how it is so easy to tell when she is aging/regressing just simply by looking at the animation (her voice also helps). Overall this is the most impressive Miyazaki art I've seen and I really haven't seen much that can top it.<br/><br/>Sound: I'll just start off by saying the music in this movie is so beautiful. I love every single background music in this movie, and the only song I don't like so much is the theme with the words that plays at the end. Aside from the beautiful soundtrack, the sounds in the movie are so dead on. Hearing Sophie's bones crack as an old woman is really painful, and as much as I don't like Sophie's voice, her seiyuu does a great job at portraying the character and how she fluctuates between young and old so frequently throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Character: The characters in this movie make up for all the lack of closure in the plot. Each character has their good points, even the Witch of the Waste. I personally adore almost all the characters, though I actually like Sophie the least of all. Calcifer, Heen, and Turnip head are such adorable and fun characters to watch (and Heen and Turnip have pretty much no lines in the whole movie). Howl is also another lovable character as well. The characters have such different personalities that you will probably like at least one character or more.<br/><br/>Enjoyment: Obviously I enjoy this film a lot. I've watched it so many times! Each time I sit there in awe of the animation and empathize with the characters. It's one of those movies that I love to watch and I have not gotten bored of it yet. I do have to say that towards the end I get slightly bored with the stressed focus on the war, but that only lasts at most 15 minutes."
"Leofwine_draca","8","0","1","24 April 2013"," Another winner from Studio Ghibli
","HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is another wonderful animation from Japan's Studio Ghibli, a children's cartoon that proves to be a moving, inventive and utterly imaginative experience for kids and adults alike. To describe it too much would be to spoil the fun; suffice to say, this is a film packed with incident and insight, with engaging characters and larger than life situations.<br/><br/>This time around, it's an anti-war feature, with war providing the backdrop to the central tale. The character of the young girl who is transformed through witchcraft into an old woman is an intriguing one, and the titular castle is a superbly animated creation. I particularly liked the supporting characters in this film: Disney usually make the characters that support the protagonists irritating in the extreme, but here they're quite brilliant: the bounding scarecrow, the living fire, even the Witch of the Wastes.<br/><br/>I find Ghibli films to be fairly hit or miss; some I love, but others like PRINCESS MONONOKE and SPIRITED AWAY are overrated in my mind. Not so this one."

"ericbobg","9","0","1","18 March 2013"," Miyazaki retells the same story. Is that problem for you? Not for me.
","See my full review here: ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2013/03/film-howls-moving-castle.html<br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki's groundbreaking animated films, like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, can be described as sweeping, fantastical, and heart- wrenchingly joyful. Equally epic, Miyazaki's 2004 film Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from Diana Wynne Jones' book of the same name, renders the viewer immobilized through the experience of a young girl on a journey of discovery. The film reaffirmed Miyazaki's role as the global ambassador of Japanese animation. He is a visionary man who understands that discovering an alternative side of life can be a revitalizing experience, and in that sense sends his audience right along with his characters.<br/><br/>The film begins in a world at war. Young Sophie works in a hat shop and bumps into Howl, a known wizard and local heartthrob She quickly falls into a world of magic and finds trouble when the Witch of the Waste binds her with a spell of old age. In her newly geriatric state she goes in search of Howl. His house, a walking, magic fortress serves as his headquarters and main point of departure for his war-related missions. Now known as Grandma Sophie, she enlists herself as his maid and finds a place among the other house mates. Howl, a tenacious wizard full of defiance and destructive power, is caught in his own difficulties. Dealing with pacifism in wartime, he has become a political casualty of the raging conflict. The struggles crescendo and combine - as they are often wont to do - and the characters face difficult, life-changing choices. The whole things comes together in classic Miyazaki style.<br/><br/>Is this starting to sound a little too ""magical"" for you? Maybe you think its just for kids? Well grow up and accept that some children's movies are even better for adults. This film was released on the tailwind of Miyazaki's most globally recognized film, Spirited Away, which had just become the first anime film to win the Academy Award for Best Animation. The two films, along with most of his movies, communicate many of the same themes. Howl, which set box office records in its own right, was highly influenced both by the previous success of Spirited Away - still the highest grossing Japanese film of all time - and by Miyazaki's own reactions to the beginning of the Iraq War. He has been classified as a pacifist, feminist, and traditionalist - all perspectives that inform his characters and their struggles. But the moralistic view of his stories is more universal than partisan. In this film Howl's struggles are treated more as personal than political.<br/><br/>While there are lessons to be learned from Howl's demons, Sophie's character growth is equally poignant as she decides to optimistically accepts the challenge of old age. Her quick transformation from young adult to elderly is one most youth would not accept lightly, and Miyazaki helps the viewer to reflect on age and identity as he explores how Sophie deals with instant maturity and physical limitation. She finds she's able to gradually shed the years by embracing life and its challenges rather than complaining about them. Love, energy, and wisdom come as she is forced to accept things she cannot change and address those she can. Life in Howl's mystical mobile home is lived a few steps away from normality. Time and space have no constancy. The resulting mobility, while exciting, has kept Howl and his house mates from facing reality. Sophie breathes some fresh air into the place as she takes responsibility and learns to value the moment and the relationships that surround her. <br/><br/>I prefer watching in Japanese with English subtitles. When coupled with the beautiful, melancholy score it completes the cultural journey and give you a truly foreign experience. If you just can't handle reading while watching, or you are enjoying it with kids, turn on the translation. John Lasseter - Miyazaki's championing super fan in the US - and his team at Disney went to significant lengths to make a quality English translation including recording voice-over work by critically acclaimed actors.<br/><br/>This film is a gem during which I always sit in constant amazement. The beguiling blend of music, love, magic, and visuals creates an orchestral experience. Just as Miyazaki's character's rarely finish a film in the same form they began it, you'll be closer to internalizing the fact that life is always changing. And maybe you'll see the young person inside the next old face you see."
"charnotcher","10","0","1","14 February 2013"," Now THAT'S Love
","Almost everyone who watches Howl's Moving Castle praises its eloquent condemnation of senseless war or its inventive fantasy world—and rightly so. But I don't think the movie is about either of those things. At its heart, Howl's Moving Castle is the coming-of-age love story of the flamboyant, elusive, immature wizard Howl and the mousy Sophie. If you read it as such and watch it closely, the somewhat puzzling details resolve themselves—and you will even learn about love. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie is unusually complex. But, never fear, you're in the hands of Hayao Miyazaki, a master storyteller, so you can trust that there is coherent meaning in every detail. I recommend watching the film at least twice: once just to enjoy and again to trace the various subplots (the missing prince, the draft-dodging, the curse-breaking, the time-traveling, the villain-vanquishing). You'll begin to find significance in the gentlemanly service of ""Turniphead,"" Sophie's shifting age, and Howl's first line in the movie, ""There you are, sweetheart. Sorry I'm late. I was looking everywhere for you."" <br/><br/>Even though Howl's Moving Castle is set in a fairy tale world, complete with witches, wizards, and demons, I find that the main story is readily applicable to the non-magical human. Here's how I would summarize it: Sophie and Howl are two dissatisfied loners, but they find the capability and the courage to protect each other and the family that they acquire through their adventures. Along the way, Howl's Moving Castle teaches us that true love . . .<br/><br/>1. Enables us to see the potential in each other. <br/><br/>2. Grants us the courage we need to protect our loved ones. <br/><br/>3. Can prevent or end ""idiotic war."" <br/><br/>4. Spreads beyond two people and embraces those around them. <br/><br/>5. Doesn't require us to be flawless or boring. <br/><br/>But my favorite lesson on love occurs at the end of the movie when, in typical fairy tale fashion, Prince Charming finally appears to claim Sophie as his ""one true love."" She, however, is all but oblivious to the prince because she's so unapologetically in love with Howl, the man that she's made a life with. The much-neglected truth here: true love, despite its challenges, is much more magical than a fairy tale love that doesn't require us to struggle and grow. <br/><br/>There are lots of flawed ideas about love out there, but every time I finish Howl's Moving Castle, I experience an uncanny feeling of recognition that's best summed up by a song title from the soundtrack: ""Now that's Love."""

","This film has perhaps the highest animation quality ever. It is truly stupendous: the mountains and skies are painted with such a beauty that it makes it appear really stupid that some film studios are making animated films in CGI, which looks like plastic dolls. This, on the other hand, is real art and it looks stupendous.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have a well defined story, instead, it is quite an art- house film that doesn't follow the Hollywood conventions but at the same time it was a quite popular film in Japan, becoming the third highest grossing film in Japanese history after Titanic and Spirited Away (indeed, Avatar's gross in 2009 wasn't high enough to surpass this film).<br/><br/>This combination of artistic value with entertainment value is what makes Miyazaki's film so special."

"tuomas_gimli","6","0","1","2 November 2012"," Far from Miyazaki's best
","Howl's Moving Castle has the potential to be probably the best Ghibli film ever, and that already is an insanely high remark. All the elements are there: gorgeous animation, interesting story, a beautifully crafted world and perhaps the most fun and imaginative cast of characters Ghibli has ever brought on screen. Yet, staggeringly , the elements never quite come together, and the end result feels more like a collection of bits than one coherent whole.<br/><br/>The story is ultimately the movie's downfall: whereas previous Miyazaki films have had either a strong narrative (Laputa, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke), or a character-focused approach with barely any story (Totoro, Ponyo), Howl's Moving Castle falls somewhere in the middle and suffers gravely for it. There are many strong characters with their own stories, yet there is also the main plot to keep track of, and these two ultimately don't mix. The main focus seems to get lost time after time, as plot twists appear seemingly without any setup. It's also strangely difficult to describe Howl's character: Is he a superficial douche? Is he a wise and kind yet young wizard? Is he a cold bystander or a tormented power tool torn by his indecision? I myself never really figured it out.<br/><br/>But all the things Miyazaki is known for are still here: the animation is beyond beautiful, the score is great (if not very memorable), the sheer amount of imagination brought on-screen is amazing and the characters, especially Calcifer, are delicately crafted and all likable. It's just sad that the messy story overwhelms these aspects, and the end result feels uneven and in need of streamlining.<br/><br/>Recommendation: This movie will undoubtedly be understood better by those who have read the novel. For those who haven't I would recommend adjusting your expectations. Don't watch this movie for the story, just let yourself drown in the visuals and the atmosphere."

When Sofi takes offence at her comments, the Witch punishes her by cursing her with the body of a hagged old lady, she is also unable to explain about the curse to anyone. With her inability to explain, she decides to leave home and venture into the Wastes outside of town, there, with the assistance of a strange hopping scarecrow, she manages to climb aboard Howl's Moving Castle, taking shelter from the cold winds. There, she meets the heart of the Castle known as Calcifer, a fire demon that gives the castle it's life with his power.

","Well, as i can see, after watching this movie you are rather absolutely amazed or totally disappointed. I think I'm more related to the second group of people. The characters are nice, the idea is nice , there is that GREAT ADVENTURE that makes a movie stand out in a crowd but I guess there isn't a MAIN IDEA, the clearly displayed idea. There were just A LOT OF INTERESTING sequences and quotes and thoughts, but none of them was developed enough. For example there is the interior conflict about beauty as Sophie is not beautiful and Howl is, then there is something about war, something about overcoming your hate and the will for revenge and many many other great concepts but they were not presented and developed clearly enough, as at some points the movie is moving too fast and you just don't get enough time to pay attention to them. Besides, there were also many useless details. So, in conclusion, if you want to make a good movie, the idea is JUST NOT ENOUGH. I guess it's sometimes complicated to get rid of all the details and focus on ONE main idea or maybe two, but that's what really makes a movie great, doesn't it?<br/><br/>MAIN CHARACTERISTICS<br/><br/>----1hour 58 min (which means LONG! if you do easily get bored, this movie is not for you) <br/><br/>---on the other hand the movie is MOVING FAST, so if you don't really look for a good idea, concept, than you will probably enjoy watching it just for this fact.<br/><br/>---THE ANIMATION IS GOOD AND THE CARTOON ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL"

","I've never been a fan of anime (I find the generic facial features of the protagonists a real put-off) until I discovered this film and the Ghibli studio. Since watching Howl's Moving Castle (dubbed version) I have eagerly sought out other films by Ghibli and particularly by Miyazake. The artwork is stunning and the attention to detail beyond anything, especially since this is hand-drawn, with little, if any, CG. So much better than the flat 2-dimensional work seen in much of Disney's offerings. I'm not sure how much was lost in translation - but I found the story satisfying if occasionally a bit light in content and explanation (without spoiling - the details of the curses and their 'cures' are mainly left to the viewer to work out) - but this is minor in the overall effect of the film, which is amazing. You get sucked into this fantastic alternative reality; the characters are appealing and the stellar cast for the English language voice-over (Christian Bale, Lauren Bacall, Jean Simmons, etc)did justice to the animation characters. My one niggle was why Christian Bale had to adopt an American accent for Howl (when he is in fact British), whilst the character of Sophie spoke with a British accent - but this is just nit-picking! See this movie! It's fabulous!"

","Based upon the 1986 book by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle was adopted into a movie in 2004 by Studio Ghibli. Beloved director Hayao Miyazaki, who is known for his other works including Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind, also worked on writing the screenplay and helped to design the famous Moving Castle. The English version is host to esteemed actors such as Christian Bale and Jean Simmons and has grossed $231,711,096 worldwide, appealing to everyone ages 1-100. <br/><br/>Focusing around the outspoken and cursed Sophie, Howl's Moving Castle brings in a collection of unforgettably witty characters. With some, such as Wizard Howl, anyone watching will roll their eyes. With some, the watcher will sympathize to their plight, like with the Fire Demon, Calcifer. With some, especially Madam Suliman, you may even want to scream, aghast at how they manipulate multiple people into risking their lives. Together, each of the characters play their own part in war of magic against magic as they race around small towns, big cities, and, of course, the Moving Castle.<br/><br/>At first, Howl's Moving Castle seems simple, a girl working in a hat shop while her family goes off to enjoy the evening. Eventually, however, everything changes. This girl, young Sophie, stumbles upon an arrogant coward, Wizard Howl and from there on out, she is hunted by the jealous Witch of the Waste. When Sophie, an old woman because of an encounter with the Witch left her cursed, barges into Howl's roaming castle, that is, it actually contains jointed legs and wanders around the countryside, she disrupts the Wizard's life almost as much as he disrupted hers. Together, wizard and cursed woman must try to stop the war while saving Howl and Calcifer from their contract.<br/><br/>Curses aren't simple and neither are their solutions. Both Sophie and Howl suffer in their own way, one from a false age and the other from the power he uses. Luckily for both of them, Howl is as confident as he is cowardly and Howl's Moving Castle clearly shows the importance of doing what is right and what is good, even if you wish to run away. Wizard Howl faces down Madam Suliman and even finds it in his heart to tell the truth even though he swore never to do either. Sophie, on the other hand, grows to realize that, just because she is the eldest and expected to become nothing, she can still make a name for herself. In the end, Sophie must use a courage she never knew she had and that came from her standing up to the fate chosen for her to save those she loves. Both characters must fight their natures to do what is right.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is both a book and a movie. When Miyazaki transferred the storyline over, he took a few creative liberties, including adding a war and changing the main antagonist over from the Witch of the Waste to Madam Suliman. Many parts of the script changed completely, but the core of Howl's Moving Castle remained the same. Sophie stars alongside Howl (whose true name in the book is Howell Jerkins and is randomly from Wales) and Calcifer. The contract between Howl and Calcifer functions as a large plot piece in both versions, but the terms and backlashes change between text and film, the main part being that the curse in the book does not slowly turn Howl into an animal. And, of course, no portrayal could ever change how self-centered Howl is even though he has his moments of absolute selflessness.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is incredible. Not only are the characters lovable and relatable, but the storyline is something that hasn't been done a million times over. As a standalone (meaning watching the movie without reading the book), Howl's Moving Castle intrigues watchers while also being the kind of movie you can sit down and watch over and over and over. If you're looking for a flawless book-to-movie, then Howl's Moving Castle might irritate you, but the movie is still enjoyable as another amazing production by Studio Ghibli. Anyone can appreciate to movie, and, personally, I highly recommend watching Howl's Moving Castle sometime in your life."

","Whenever it is possible, get the best version of this that you can get your hands on. This, by the way, is one thing that you can have in a dubbed version that is just solid. Just take a look at the English vocalists. Astonishing. Christian Bale? Lauren Bacall? Blythe Danner? Billy Crystal, for God's sake!!??? Who knew? (Well, not me, obviously) I am not going to say a damn thing about the plot. The less you know, the better. But I will point out that the animation is very deceptive. It might look almost cheap at first. But pay attention. It will be well rewarded.

","Well done Mr. Miyazaki, you have proved once again that you can combine an excellent story line, creative imagination and visually stunning artwork to create magic. This movie upholds all standards of a Miyazaki film.<br/><br/>When I first started watching this, I imagine my first impression was similar to those of many other: slight confusion, but incredibly mystified by the concept, unable to look away. It has the surreal and dreamy feel of Alice In Wonderland, and I couldn't help but be drawn into the story. The characters are well rounded, and the relationships between them are very interesting. The film has an incredible knack of surrounding you with all these events, thoughts and a dream-esqe atmosphere that you want to watch it again and again to relive this strange world. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was lovely as well, and this movie is one I highly recommend to anyone open to being brought into a fantastic world you couldn't possibly imagine."

","This weekend took the kids to another Hayao Miyazaki film known as ""Hauru No Ugoku Shiroâ? in Japanese or ""Howl's Moving Castle (2004)â? in English. The film is advertised as being based loosely on a novel and I would hazard to say the loosely part probably has something to do with the injection of Miyazaki's frequent themes which include allusions to the Hiroshima bombing, and pacifism. However, this time out Miyazaki doesn't demonstrate the environmental concern normally prevalent in his work. Our eighteen year old animated heroine is Sophie who hides from society after being cursed into old age by the Witch of the Waste. Miyazaki borrows some elements of ""The Wizard of Ozâ? in the witch's name and in the form of a talking scarecrow. Sophie takes refuge in the moving castle of the title and consistent with the dream-like quality of Miyazaki's films, this keep is a monstrous contraption composed of thousands of moving, steaming and grinding parts on 4 spindly legs powered by a fire demon called Calcifer. Howl is a self-centered wizard who is struggling to avoid being drafted into destructive war along with the rest of the kingdom's magic denizens. The war is over the disappearance of the prince of the land â"" a plot point that does not become important until the very end of the picture. Markl, Howl's apprentice and Suliman, his former tutor, round out the cast of good and evil respectively. Sophie's first task is to bring order to Howl's castle and by extension to Howl himself who is extremely powerful but largely adrift in self-indulgence. Her second task is to get the Witch of the Waste to lift the curse which she ultimately fails at because Suliman tricks and disarms the Witch first. Sophie makes peace with this former enemy and winds up caring for her. It is left to the newly focused Howl to defeat his former tutor lifting the curse from Sophie and from the scarecrow who turns out to be the missing prince thus stopping the war. The story drifts quite a bit and there are definitely points in the film where things grind to halt. However, the animation, particularly the actual castle, are amazing and this helps to carry the audience through the 2 hour runtime."

","Based on the novel Howl's Moving Castle, written by Dianna Wynna Jones, Hayao Miyazaki had produced yet another phenomenal movie hit world wide. Like many of Miyazaki's successful movies such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Castle in the sky and many others, the stories in which these movies were based upon were altered and mixed with Miyazaki's own personal beliefs. Howl's Moving Castle is shown with classic Miyazaki: feminism, war, and love. The themes presented in the movie, although somewhat in a lull, progressively strengthen Sofi's and Howl's love story. Another key iconological factor to all Hayao Miyazaki films is the captivating traditional hand-drawn animation. <br/><br/>In almost all of Miyazaki's films, the protagonist is a strong young woman, or child, for he had a feministic view. They are first shown as timid and weak, but progressively grow strong, and fierce young ladies that go against the 'norm' for a woman – their love being the main reason for such acts. In his movies, the young women are in high positions, or leaders – Sofi had to take initiative in order to protect the person she loves, Madame Suliman served as the King's Royal Sorcerer with extremely strong power; in Spirited Away, Yubaba was the boss of the bath house; Princess Mononoke was the defender of nature and stood as the right hand man of the spirits. In this movie, Sofi was often static for she was stuck in the house. She showed no signs of power till her love grew for Howl. The fact that he was hurting ignited a fire in her heart to protect him, and along with the others. Her love gave her courage, fearlessness, and finally got into motion. Normally in Miyazaki films, the war (not necessarily with fire power, but a war as in any sign of conflicting parties) played a significant role for everyone (Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso). In Howl's Moving Castle, the war was merely a moving factor to reel Howl and Sofi together. <br/><br/>Hayao Miyazaki is regarded as the world's greatest animator. His style of animation is through traditional hand-drawn animation, and water colors. Every swipe of his brush, every outline, has a unique feeling being created through his art. In each shot there is breath-taking magic mixed with his rich creativity. All of his movies are fused with wild fantasy, sometimes with more serious issues such as environmentalism, and politics. All of Miyazaki's films have a part of his soul attached to it, giving it life and individuality."
"Atuatucorum","9","0","1","2 August 2011"," A gem!
","""Howl's Moving Castle"" is, in many ways, a modern take on ""Cinderella"". The story revolves around Sophie Hatter, who is continuing in her father's footsteps and keeps a modest hat shop, while her stepmother Fanny lives happily on the income. Sophie's younger sister Lettie, who is widely admired for her beauty and sweet manners, has settled comfortably in a life outside the hat shop and is greatly worried about Sophie's fate. But soon, a witch appears on the scene to transform Sophie, forcing the girl to take matters into her own hands.<br/><br/>Like in Cinderella, Sophie visits the castle in disguise and meets its owner; unlike in the fairy tale, however, she does not enter the castle as a beautiful princess. The inhabitants of the castle are confronted with a woman in her nineties, because that is what Sophie's character has been in spite of her young looks. She dances, not with the prince, but with the broom to furiously clean the dingy rooms of the moving castle.<br/><br/>Appearances may often deceive, and this film elaborates on that theme with great care. Disguises abound in the story. The fireplace holds more than one secret; the terrifying scarecrow Sophie meets on her way to the castle is waiting for a kiss to reveal its true self. The Witch of the Waste uses spells to appear as the grande dame we (and Sophie) meet her as. Most importantly, the master of the castle himself, wizard Howl, is capable of stealing the hearts of all the young ladies with his dazzling smile, but on the inside, he is quite the opposite of beautiful. Sophie sees through his good looks and recognises him as cowardly and selfish. At the same time, he sees through her curse and recognises the young woman in her. In fact, their encounter is of the ""Beauty and Beast"" type, challenging them to see each other and themselves for what they truly are to find happiness.<br/><br/>Sophie's curse, we soon learn, cannot be broken even by the Witch who cast it. As the story progresses, however, Sophie gains insight into herself. At the same time, her visible aspect alternates between ages; this technique of depiction may confuse greatly, as no direct explanation is given. But there is one straightforward scene: Sophie regains her young looks at one point, only to falter and revert to her 90-year-old-self, explaining to a shocked Howl that age is comfortable.<br/><br/>When Sophie does find the courage to grow up, she is rewarded with true happiness. This, albeit powerful in itself, is not the only message the film wants to deliver. The country which the moving castle is roaming is at war; wizard Howl, summoned by his king to aid the forces, initially tries to run by assuming various identities. He later reveals his abhorrence of war and soldiers in strong words, although he does eventually join the battles. This aspect could have been fleshed out more; unfortunately, we do not learn why this war was started in the first place, nor do we ever see the enemy. The resolution is that Mme. Suliman and Prince Justin (whose identity may be lost on the audience) simply decide to ""end this silly war"". With so many serious, deep conversations (and battles!) going on earlier, there could have been a stronger impact dealt on the audience, maybe by implementing another scene at the king's palace and thereby also reducing the length of the ""kissing fest"" before the final scene.<br/><br/>The clincher, however, is very well done; Sophie is shown with her new family and the castle has gained a new feature. As it soars above the clouds, we cannot help but feel elated with Sophie. All in all, this animation film comes in the disguise of a light fairy tale but has much to offer below its pretty surface to think about. It may be telling that I was compelled to watch it again on the very next day, because it had so much to say within such a short time. If you care enough, do look into the excellent novel the film is based on. The film itself can be very thought-provoking and rewarding, so please do not be deterred by confusion. Enjoy!"

","When I first saw Howl's Moving Castle, I wasn't sure what to expect. All I knew about the movie was that it was based on a good book and that it had been created by the maker of Spirited Away. Though I had never read the book, the movie seemed to be well liked, so I sat down and watched. Unfortunately, while the animation was very pretty, the nonsensical nature of the plot and lack of real character development really ruined things for me.<br/><br/>The story centers around Sophie, a young girl who is cursed by a which to live in the body of an old woman. Why did the which curse Sophie in particular? Your guess is as good as mine. The movie doesn't offer an explanation -and you'll have to get used to that in a hurry if you want to sit through the rest of the film. As an old woman, Sophie takes shelter in Howl's moving castle, where she meets the wizard Howl, his pet fire spirit calcifur, and his 7-year old (that's my guess anyway) assistant who's name I don't remember. Now at this point, I actually thought that things were shaping up to be an interesting movie. Here we had a magical castle inhabited by wizards and fire spirits, fantastic animation, and a couple of genuinely interesting characters. In particular, at this point I was really starting to empathize with Sophie, who seemed like a very realistic character. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from here. As the so called ""plot"" progressed, the only character development we receive concerning Howl is that he doesn't like war and that he likes to look pretty. As for the witch, she's evil. Bet you didn't see that one coming. But a couple of paper-thin characters aren't the only problem here. Unanswered questions upon unanswered questions plague the story. Why is there a war going on? Why does the witch want to find Howl? Speaking of the witch, developments with her later in the story will leave you scratching your head until you've got a bald spot. Add in some inexplicably magic rings which can apparently travel through time, flying men made of black goo which nobody seems to think are conspicuous and well, without giving away spoilers, all I can say is that the last quarter of the movie will probably not make any sense at all to you if you haven't read the book.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie, I was watching it with three friends. Two of them had read the book, and one (like me) hadn't. At the end of the film, both I and the friend who hadn't read the book were glad it was finally over with. The touching ending was lost on us simply because we had no idea what caused it. The other two friends didn't think the movie was that bad. I think that's just what it boils down to in the end. If you've read the book, you might enjoy this movie. If not don't hold your breath."

"FilmFreak94","10","0","1","24 June 2011"," My Favorite Movie From Hayao Miyazaki
","Howl's Moving Castle is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. The animation is spectacular, the English dubbing is near perfect, and the story is complex and engaging that might move you to tears at certain points. The story is taken from the book of the same name written by the late Diana Wynne Jones. It follows a young woman named Sophie who owns a hat shop and leads a very sheltered life. Until one day she meets a strange wizard named Howl who literally sweeps her off her feet. Later she encounters The Witch of the Waste(an old flame of Howl's) who turns her into an old woman out of spite. Sophie now travels to Howl's Castle to try to break her spell and work as a cleaning lady. There she meets Howl's apprentice Markl, and a fire demon named Calcifer. Calcifer says if she can break a certain pact with him and Howl then he will try to break the spell that's on her.<br/><br/>That's the basic plot behind the film but as we enter the middle of the film it becomes much more complex and it all leads up to a thrilling climax and Sophie trying to break the spell that's on her and Howl. This is not only my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie but it's also my second favorite animated movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out."
"bfprower","6","0","1","16 May 2011"," A Weak Miyazaki Film, But Still A Miyazaki Film
","I'm an enormous fan of Hayao Miyazaki. With each and every one of films one can expect lavish animation, an enormous amount of creativity and imagination, and an experience that pulls the viewer into another world. I find in each of his films there is a scene or two that simply puts one's jaw to the floor and leaves this sense of epic satisfaction. All of the above exist in Howl's Moving Castle, as does a certain amount of flaw. This flaw lies in two elements, and unfortunately they're the most important elements in the film, the story and characters. <br/><br/>The story takes place in a fictional world of sorcery and magic. A laboring girl named Sophie falls under and aging curse from an envious witch. She ventures, somewhat unwittingly, to the home of the wizard Howl, which is a large castle capable of moving anywhere in the fabric of existence. In short, the story is overwhelmingly complex and contains a lot of separate factors that conform around the leading characters. As you can guess, Howl's Moving Castle suffers from trying to pack too much into one plot. We have multiple character arcs, not a mention of war going on at once. Now that doesn't sound too difficult, it's been accomplished before. But this is Miyazaki film, and things are extremely deep with a lot of subliminal work that there's just not room for. The story comes off as being very choppy as well as rushed. What's worse is, the spaces between the many chunks of story are very small, and could have been resolved with an extra thirty seconds of dialogue and animation. The story also lacks a time lapse, and the viewers are supposed to buy that all happens within a relatively short amount of time, which is fairly difficult with all things considered. I think this is in part due to the fact that Howl's Moving Castle is not original piece unlike most Miyazaki films. This was actually based off of a novel by Diana Jones. And it displays all the flaws one has come to expect of a book to film conversion. Not to mention Diana Jones is a British author and Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, so there may have been a slight amount cultural disconnect. <br/><br/>The flaws of the story spill into the flaws with the characters. Now the large cast of characters are very well developed, three dimensional, interesting and entertaining; however they're not very consistent. Sophie's actions constantly contradict either something she previously did or said, or anything a reasonable person would do. Howl is said to be a cruel, heartless womanizer who exploits and tortures women, yet we're never shown him doing so. And the above isn't just a rumor amongst the characters; it's a firm fact, and its existence is one of the main plot points. Not to mention there's one scene where he acts like the complete opposite of his character in the rest of the film. All of this boils into a climax, that while drawn and executed perfectly, is mind-boggling and makes no sense whatsoever. Another thing worth mention is: while watching the film (I preferred to watch it in Japanese, which is my recommendation) the subtitles frequently displayed dialogue in which I couldn't hear anyone talking. Either this is the result of a faulty DVD, or really bad sound mixing, likely the latter. <br/><br/>I know it sounds like I'm really bashing the film, but it's just one of those movies where the positives (which there are plenty of) are just hard to put into text. The art direction and the way the story is expressed through the animation are spectacular and the atmosphere it creates is nothing short of magical. The story contains a lot of passion, and its themes of lust, deception and warfare are integrated very well. I found myself very attached to the characters and the scenes are so well crafted, they alone make Howl's Moving Castle worth multiple views. <br/><br/>My favorite animated movies, which I also view as the best, are films that succeed at the surface but really strive beneath it. Films such as Princess Mononoke, The Fox and the Hound, and The Secret of NIMH are examples of films that do this perfectly. Howl's Moving Castle gets better and better the deeper the experience goes. The subliminal messages, the emotion and the attachment are absolutely perfect. But it's at the surface where it fails. I really wanted to love Howl's Moving Castle, but the rough story and two-faced characters kept me from doing so. I did however like it, and it's pretty hard not to."

","Putting my absolute admiration for the director Hayao Miyazaki aside, Howl's Moving Castle is an epic and awesome anime movie. The art is amazing and is hand drawn, do not think for a second that this means that the characters don't look good. If anything, it makes it so much more human like and real. This fantasy movie rocks the world and the more times you watch it the more you like it and identify the clever hints hidden in dialogue. I Absolutely love the movie's magical world with it's charms and potions. It is only very loosely based on the book, in fact all that's the same is that character names and the moving castle. But for Hayao Miyazaki to actually IMAGINE and Flesh out the castle and the parallel worlds and magic is truly raw talent and skill. His movie should not really be compared to the book at all since they are nearly completely different. This is a must watch movie for all ages! AND if you happen to think your too old then wait till you have children and encourage them to watch this movie, its so rare to find a movie good in every aspect with originality these days and this movie deserves to be past on and remembered as a true classic."

","I haven't read the novel by Dianne Wynne Jones that this is loosely based on(but I understand that while this is not that direct of an adaptation, she is very happy with how it turned out). The young Sofie, a girl who doesn't feel attractive, becomes the victim of a spell that ages her. She then becomes the cleaning lady at the titular legged, moving castle of a powerful, selfish yet insecure young sorcerer Hauru, who she is infatuated with. We go with her on the ride to this amazing world of magic(in the universe this takes place in, it's almost commonplace) and quirky, strange and imaginative creatures, including a helpful living scarecrow, a charming, small and very old dog and the fire demon Calcifer(that eats egg shells and such to sustain himself). The focus is not on a ton of different creatures, settings or curses; the ones there are, are hypnotic, unforgettable and effective. This builds atmosphere and really gets to you, taking the time to draw you in, instead of the often scared-to-stand-still American norm(just because animation *can* move fast doesn't mean it always should). There is real personality to the locations, the beings and of course the characters. The sheer level of creativity and detail here is spellbinding. This has a great plot, if it is perhaps a tad vague at times and leaves you with unnecessary questions. I watched this with the original Japanese voices and subtitles, and I would definitely say that is the best way to go. The acting is spot-on. This has a marvelous score. While some of the humor is pretty silly, this is also genuinely funny at times. It can also be rather cute and sweet. This is 110 minutes sans credits. The art and designs are breathtaking, with little CGI. There is disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a 19 and a half minute featurette about how they animated the walking structure, a 7 and a half minute interview with the author of the book and a couple of TV spots and trailers. I recommend this to any fan of Animé. 10/10"

","Miyazaki takes us into another delightful world of magic, charm, innocence and amusement. Even though his movies appear to be light entertainers on the surface, Miyazaki doesn't shy away from bringing important issues into the story. He does it very subtly like how, in 'Hauru No Ugoku Shiro', he depicts the characters (except Sofi) as being conscious of their physical image. Whereas today we live in a world where almost everyone is overly conscious of their physical appearance.<br/><br/>The story of 'Hauru No Ugoku Shiro' follows young Sofi, a saleswoman at a hatshop. Sofi doesn't think she's beautiful but she's not too preoccupied with her looks unlike the people around her. She goes on living her routine life. Until one evening, just when she'd closed the shop, she receives a visit from a customer, a rude elderly lady, who turns her into an old woman. Sofi is surprised but not terrified. She puts her routine on hold in order to find a solution. She rescues a scarecrow who helps her get to Howl's moving castle. From then on, begins a new adventure.<br/><br/>Miyazaki is a sincere storyteller and one of the finest. He has an excellent imagination. His stories always have heart and even though he includes elements of fantasy, his characters are always real.<br/><br/>The animation is first class and the whimsical score is superb. The special effects department have done a competent job in designing the movements of the moving castle.<br/><br/>'Hauru No Ugoku Shiro' is another gem from the Studio Ghibli factory and I'd recommend their films to anyone who loves cinema and imagination."
"Akriloth2160","8","0","1","24 August 2010"," Howl's Moving Castle Review
","There have been a lot of anime movies that I really enjoy watching, although hardly any of them attract any sort of attention. It's a shame, because one particular anime studio, Studio Ghibli, has been responsible for some of the biggest masterpieces in Japanese cinema to date, such as My Neighbour Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery Service, and the first ever anime film to receive an Oscar, Spirited Away. Now we have Howl's Moving Castle, a steampunk fantasy film based rather loosely on the British adult fantasy novel of the same name. The main plot is about a girl who offends a sorceress known as the witch of the waste, and as a result, gets transformed into an old woman. She seeks refuge in a giant frog/chicken-like structure which is the castle of a mysterious sorcerer known as Howl. There are some pretty odd elements in the whole film, such as Howl himself being able to transform into a giant bird, a door which leads to one of four completely different places depending on the twist of a coloured knob, a plucky fire demon who powers the whole castle (Who, by the way, has the voice of legendary American comedian, Billy Crystal), and something of a rarity for fictional structures, the fact that the entire castle is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside (As opposed to stuff like the TARDIS and the Narnia Wardrobe). Overall, this movie is a really captivating, immersive, moving (It moved me to tears at one point, I can tell you!) and sometimes quite funny (Especially that rather bored little dog!) roller-coaster ride of a fantasy film that really deserves more than it already has received at the box office. OK, so The Matrix still remains my favourite movie of all time, but Howl's Moving Castle just manages to scratch Neo's undercarriage (Eww!) since it's almost as amazing. Watch. This. Movie. Now."

","If I had only one 10 for Miyazaki's movies, I'd give it to this one! Although the story is one of the most complex ones, it really does have a proper plot from start to finish, unlike some other Miyazaki's movies which have weird endings/unfinished stories, well at least in my opinion... The visuals and the music are of course magnificent, I could listen to the soundtrack all day long... There are plenty of interesting, well-developed characters and of course Miyazaki's trademarks like an anti-war theme, flying aircrafts etc. There is a fine balance of action and ''calmer'' parts of the movie, also the line between magical and real is set very good in my opinion... I love how Howl's room is stuffed with so many things and looks so comfortable!^^ Whenever I'm feeling depressed, I like to watch this movie, especially the scenes that take place in large, open scenery like the woods and the mountains, it makes you feel very warm inside. One scene in particular always comes up first though, it's the one where they make and eat breakfast, I dunno why, maybe because the food looks so deliciousXD... Anyways, as a Miyazaki fan I urge you to watch this movie! You'll be taken into a world where not everything is perfect and good, but where friendship (and a little bit of magic;)) can do wonders!"

Howl's Moving Castle I don't think suits the writer. I'd have to read the book, I know it's based off a book. But Hayou Miyazaki usually makes some movies with child-like romances like let me explain, Porco Rosso... I didn't really enjoy. And Whisper of the Heart... the film I did enjoy. Hayou Miyazaki's movies have many adventures, friendship (with little romance), mostly fantasy. And some lyrical drama and comedy every once in a while. This film mostly had too many kisses especially the main character, who kissed almost everybody on the deck or whatever. But the film received its nice-paced drama and comedy and the action keeps some children from getting scared or crying.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is a definite must-see movie for grown-ups and children."

","I saw this movie once more, an for its benefit I must say that it grows on me every time I see it! For a brief summary of the plot, Howl is a young yet powerful wizard who is very sought after by girls infatuated with him and by the King that wants to recruit his services to the ensuing war. Sophie, a young girl working at a hat store, is cursed by a witch that turns her in to an old woman. As she wonders out of town she ends up working as a cleaning lady in the moving castle where Howl roams about in the countryside, escaping the frantic of civilization. There she meets a fire demon that recognizes her spell and tells her of a mysterious spell that links him with Howl. Howl's moving castle is a touching love story and fantasy fable all rolled in to one. Of course, Myiazaki's trademarks (and Ghibli's production values) are very much present here. The painted landscapes are just breathtaking, among Myiazaki's best drawings. In deed the fictitious country where the movie takes place, that could very well by from turn of the century Europe, has much of nature depicted through these landscapes as of civilization and technology starting to boom from its cradle. Here magic and wizards are a part of society and the front line on the upcoming war with the neighboring country. War, civilization opposed to nature, the difficulties of growing up, all of these are usual themes in much of Myiazaki's work and are here presented in a way reminiscent of some of Disney's nineties classics. Another interesting fact, also common to many of the director's movies, is that some key elements from the story are suggested radder than explicitly presented, allowing you to sink in with every new viewing and reevaluating it's relevance in the Japonese master's work. A truly wonderful experience, that only a handful of directors know how to do. Despite it's inevitable similarities and comparisons with other Myiazaki movies (which tend to arouse criticism), Howl's moving castle is, first a foremost, a beautiful love story!"
"lewiskendell","6","0","1","22 March 2010"," Beautiful, but the story is lacking.
","Watching a new Studio Ghibili movie is an event that has few equals in film. Each time, the viewer knows that by the time the movie is over, there's a huge chance that they will have another title to add to their list of favorites. That's a wonderful thing...but with expectations like those, sadly there is bound to eventually be disappointment. I suppose that time has finally come for me. <br/><br/>I certainly didn't hate Howl's Moving Castle. Some parts of it were as wonderful as I could have ever expected. First of all, it's beautiful. I could not have asked for more in that regard. The backgrounds, settings, and characters are so gorgeously drawn and animated, that each frame is its own individual work of art. A number of the characters were very appealing to me, as well. Who didn't instantly love Sophie and Turnip-head? I even liked the character of Calcifer (and Billy Crystal's voice-acting). On the other hand, I never warmed to Christian Bale's Howl or The Witch of the Wastes, but that makes complete sense within the context of the story. Those two creations were not really written to be liked.<br/><br/>(A special commendation has to be given to the animators and voice actors who kept Sophie as a clearly recognizable character, even as her appearance underwent several changes. That couldn't have been easy to do, but it really helps the viewer form a bond with her.)  <br/><br/>So, where did my disappointment come from? The story. I realize that this isn't an original Miyazaki creation (instead, it's an adaptation of a popular British book from the 80's), so perhaps they had difficulties in working within another person's vision? So much that I wanted to know about the characters and their world, is left unexplained. Huge plot points come and go in a brief span of time, with very little comment. Howl's story was fortunately fully-resolved, and it could be argued that everything else is unnecessary, but it feels to me like there were a lot of missed opportunities. Even the main plot was a bit boring and frustratingly vague. Howl's Moving Castle could have been a fantastic movie, but these niggling issues make it no better than average.<br/><br/>There's a wide-range of discussion and contention about which Miyazaki movie is the best, but general consensus is that none of them are less than decent . Some people will absolutely love this, it just didn't appeal to my tastes as much as some other Ghibli films have. At the very least, Howl's Moving Castle is worth watching for the extraordinary visuals."
"sethness","6","0","1","21 December 2009"," Too focused on physical beauty and age-ism
","Like most of Miyazaki's work, this is a visually stunning world with lots of inventiveness displayed in character design, architecture, and back-story.<br/><br/>The physical layout is annoyingly trapped in clichés that don't work on a logical level: we're asked to accept the legitimacy of a KINGdom (have we all forgotten that our forefathers worked hard to drag us out from under kings into democracy???), war for war's sake, steam-punk aircraft that wouldn't work in a real world, and pseudo-victorianism.<br/><br/>The most painful pills to swallow, though, are the sexism, and the revolting tie-ins between youth, physical beauty, and beauty of the spirit. Anyone less than physically perfect and young will be outraged by Miyazaki's indefensible tying together of youth, beauty, and kindness. In Miyazaki's world, as in most Japanese anime, goodhearted characters are not permitted to be ugly, and vice versa. Old age is ridiculed nonstop throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film is sexist in the sense that women's chief preoccupation is romance, housekeeping, frilly hats, and child-rearing, while men are portrayed as warmongering metrosexual tin soldiers.<br/><br/>The dubbing into English goes fairly well, though the original Japanese is so curt that the voice actors clearly struggle to say their lines rapidly, thereby losing much of the emotional inflection that the lines deserve.<br/><br/>There's also an embarrassing oversight in the voice casting: one character magically becomes old and young versions of itself (without time travel), and when the age alters, the accent stupidly switches from British to American. The voice casting was sloppy-- it should have kept the accent uniform."

Howl's moving castle is my favorite book and I was jazzed about this movie, but as I watched it I realized that this was a story that I had not heard before. By all means, go watch it. It is wonderful. But fans of the book, beware. This is Miyazaki's story, not that of Diana Wynne Jones.<br/><br/>As a Miyazaki movie, I felt that this one was an interesting change from his usual style of fantasy. Like the others, there are strong elements of steampunk and witchcraft, which I loved, but this was a much softer fantasy than the rest. While his other movies were fireworks displays, this one was a field of flowers."
"Wizard-8","Null","0","1","24 July 2009"," Fine animated movie, though not perfect
","I'm not sure why it took me so long to finally sit down and watch ""Howl's Moving Castle"". Maybe the almost two hour running time discouraged me. Maybe also for the fact that Roger Ebert gave it a negative review. But I'm glad I finally watched it. There is stuff in this movie I have NEVER seen before. And the storyline kept giving new twists so that I was never sure where the movie was going.<br/><br/>I will admit the movie is not perfect. The almost two hour running time, and the fact that there is a substantial amount of stuff that could be called ""padding"" are liabilities. I think the movie would have been better if it were shorter, with scenes tightened. Another problem I had was that some of the questions that came up in the movie were never answered.<br/><br/>Still, overall, this is a movie worth seeing for adult viewers. What about children? Well, I think they could like it, but I recommend that they first see Miyazaki's KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO first to warm them up to Miyazaki's style. Then afterwards, when they sit down to watch this, plan the occasional break when you press pause on your remote. If you don't do this, your kids may get overwhelmed as well as impatient."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","3 July 2009"," Imaginative two-dimensional film-making may live on after all
","Witches and wizards under curses living in harmony in a world of humans in a more futuristic spin on WWII-era England -- let's just say the knowledge that Hayao Miyazaki merely adapted this story from a book (by Diana Wynne Jones) is surprising yet incredibly encouraging for those who love the fantasy genre, that there are artists out there with such free imaginations.<br/><br/>""Howl's Moving Castle"" is another incredible Miyazaki film that captures your imagination in every frame and its teaming up with Disney for the U.S. release proves that there is still some dedication to the animated fantasy genre and that we aren't just enjoying the last few jewels falling out of an old 2D treasure chest.<br/><br/>In what seems like a classic Miyazaki story, a girl named Sophie is put under a curse by a witch that turns her into an old woman. Seeking a cure, she ventures out to where the witches and wizards live, only to get swooped up by a mechanical castle owned by a young wizard named Howl (voiced perfectly by Christian Bale in the American version) and powered by a fire demon named Calcifer (Billy Crystal, another fantastic move by Disney). In the background, the country they are from is at war and Howl is on the run from being called into duty. It's a fairytale with romance and action to boot.<br/><br/>Imagination abounds in this movie as one would expect. Just when you think you have an understanding of the universe that's been created, there's another something magical to grasp. It can get a bit tough to make sense of as you go along, but fantasy-lovers will be captivated by how vast of a world of possibility the story creates while still sticking to the fairytale conventions that have grounded the genre throughout time: stolen hearts, curses, beastly transformation, etc. Unlike some Miyazaki movies, ""Howl"" is also more accessible through its in innocent human character living in a world much like ours that gets swept off into unfamiliar territory -- a lot like his last film, the Oscar-winning ""Spirited Away.""<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, ""Howl"" will excite you in ways you generally don't experience at the movies these days. It is escapism at its finest but not entirely out of touch with our world, a true delight from the master of imaginative film-making."

"gentendo","6","0","1","1 February 2009"," Howl's Vain Imagination
","I think Howl is perhaps the most fascinating character in this film because the first impression I had of him was completely shattered as the story progressed. At first, he seems to be this sort of superhero, crime-fighterone that is confident, clever, and courageous. This was made seemingly apparent when he saves Sophie from the Witch of the Waste's minions lurking in the alley. After being harassed, Howl dashingly comes to Sophie's rescue, literally sweeps her off her feet, glides through the sky with her in arms, and safely carries her to the top of her home balcony. Immediately I thought, ""He's like a charming superman."" This impression was later changed quite dramatically when I realized how timorous Howl really istwo scenes in particular stood out.<br/><br/>First, when Howl comes home after fighting the sky wars he appears exhausted, trudges through the hallways and collapses on a nearby chair. Sophie watches him with caring yet surprising eyes: she's never seen him look so un-gaudy before. Howl's entire body then starts to liquefy into this greenish slime as it drips onto the floorhe is wasted, disoriented. This was a particularly interesting shift in my perspective of him because he no longer carried that stereotype of the invincible superhero, but was subject to fatigue and pain. Secondthe more dramatic shiftwas during the scene when Sophie is talking to Howl sick in bed. Howl is complaining about how if he isn't beautiful there's no point to living. This was as shocking for me to hear as it was for Sophie. In this moment, the image of who we think Howl isthe chivalry knightturns out to be a vain, insecure and superficial child. Even Howl's living space suggests his vanity: filled with all sorts of golden shrines and jewelry, sculptures and other materialistic idols. All of these idiosyncrasies, though, really made Howl's character alive; believable; real. I mean, superheros are often thought to be omnipotent, fantastical and ones who perform the impossible. Though people are typically drawn to these types of superheroes, no one believes they actually exist in external reality.<br/><br/>I think Miyazaki purposely made Howl first appear supernatural so that he could later break that stereotype and show that even real superheroes are subject to certain frailties. This way the audience can really identify, connect and feel empathy for Howl's character. All of us want to have superhuman strengths but all of us are bound by imperfections; we all want to appear strong and confident, yet we all struggle with things that we're embarrassed to admit to othersHowl is no different. His character reminded me of Steven Seagle's superman character in his graphic novel, ""It's a Bird."" One line from this novel reminded me of Howl's persona: Alternate universes remind us that super heroes do not come from distant planets, but are harvested on this planet as ones that can see past their own little world, and reach out beyond their limited scope of existence and help others.<br/><br/>For Howl to conquer his weakness and to become a true superhero, the irony is that he has to help those around him break the spells they are seduced by; rather than focusing upon his own supposed ugliness. This is where Miyazaki's theme really hits home: that in order to become great and powerful (like a superhero) you have to help others become great and powerful. It wasn't only Howl that had to accomplish thisthey all did. Sophie helps Turnip become a prince; Howl helps Sophie become young again, etc. Howl's problem was that he was so self-consumed that he was blinded by how to properly wield his magical powers: he was immature. He was even warned by the queen that if he did not carefully temper his skills, he'd end up like the Witch of the Wastecorrupted. I think this is a really powerful theme because it clarifies several things. First, the importance of engaging in the relationships that surround us to get what we want; we can't isolate ourselves like hermits and throw pity parties like Howl did. Second, our need to bridle the gifts (i.e. superpowers) that come to us: not to abuse them or think we're better than others because we have them. If we do abuse them, we'll lose them like the Witch of the Waste.<br/><br/>The use of animation also helps illustrate this theme more poignantly. It seems in my mind that to become a superhero you have to enter a different worldenter a different state of mind; one that is fantastical and chimerical. Animation typically has that effect on me. That is, I feel that I've entered a completely different world and state of mind when watching something animated. I think to heighten the sense of reality that these characters live in, Miyazaki used the fantastical world of animation to help the audience to not only feel that they are part of a superheroes world, but also that they feel like superheroes themselves."
"varundelpiero","8","0","1","26 January 2009"," Studio Ghibli delivers yet again
","In a climate where animation has moved from primarily hand-drawn to CG-inspired (thanks largely to Disney Studios and Pixar), Hiyao Miyazaki (a notable and well-respected figure in Japan) proves once again that hand-drawn animation can be moving, more picturesque, and more beautiful than its counterpart. This is another visual feast from Studio Ghibli; a true work of art.<br/><br/>The story itself is a rather fascinating one, again catered for more mature audiences as opposed to children. The story develops at pace, and moves along smoothly until the last 20 minutes or so where the ending feels a bit rushed and out-of-time with the rest of the film. This may have been due to Miyazaki's intention to complete the film in less than 2 hours.<br/><br/>For me, HAURU NO UGOKU SHIRO was not as enjoyable as my first Miyazaki film, SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI. But that's not to say that I did not enjoy it thoroughly. One of my main complaints was that I did not feel as connected to Sophie as I did to Chihiro (of SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI). I also felt that Howl was a bit too petulant and moody for my liking. Nonetheless, the vast array of characters and creatures makes this a truly worthwhile watch. A final note about the voice acting (featuring Christian Bale and Emily Mortimer as the leads): it at times feels bland and generic and Billy Crystal has to step in to save the day with his comedic voice talents. Another problem that I personally had was the constant shifting of Sophie's appearance during the film, depending on who she interacts with, and what she does.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic film, with awesome visuals, and a moving score to match. Not as amazing as SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI, but a rewarding experience nonetheless. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 300 at 257. Strongly recommended."

"raypdaley182","6","0","1","3 January 2009"," Cool but weird
","I've wanted to see this ever since I saw clips of it on Jonathon Ross's ""Japanorama"" show on BBC3 several years ago. I guess you'd class it as Anime but it was clearly made with a Western audience in mind as most signs and numbers are written in English (Although I did see a poster written in German & some boxes labelled in what looked like French).<br/><br/>You don't need the subtitles switched on as there is English dialogue but the subtitles were clearly translated from Japanese as they do differ from the spoken English dialogue in grammar and structure, not all translations are exact either.<br/><br/>The look of the movie is very much like something from the mind of animator Terry Gilliam, especially the castle on legs striding across the rural countryside. Its very much like something he'd have thought of. It's difficult to know what time period the movie is supposed to be set in seeing Cavalrymen on Horses but steam powered Trams, Trains, Steam Cars & Sedan Chairs too.<br/><br/>It appears the lead character of the film is Sophie who works in a millinery shop (thats hats to you philistines) and we start off meeting her leaving work, being rescued from the over amourous attention of 2 soldiers by a chap who not only seems to know Jedi Mind tricks but can also fly and is being chased by evil black ectoplasmic creatures.<br/><br/>Sophie discusses her encounter with her sister Lettie and they also discuss Howl (he's clearly a Wizard and everyone thinks he's evil and eats womens hearts), returning to the Shop Sophie has a spell cast on her by The Witch Of The Wastes which turns her into an old women. She avoids her mother and leaves town rescuing a scarecrow which repays her with a walking cane and helps her to find shelter, inside Howls Moving Castle. A bit like the Tardis, even though its moving the inside of the castle always remains stationary as though it were a normal static dwelling.<br/><br/>This is obviously a world where magic is totally normal (as Sophie wasn't surprised by a magical scarecrow) as meeting a Fire Demon called Calciifer didn't even seem to phase her, it seems Howls Castle is even more like the Stargate as it is able to be static yet its front door and exterior can be in many different locations at once (Actually it seems to be based on the Terry Pratchett idea of Wandering Shops).<br/><br/>All of the callers seem to think different Wizards live there but none think it is Howl. We discover the man who saved Sophie is of course Howl (who can't be that great a wizard if he doesn't recognise someone under an spell) and to remain close to him she pretends she is his new cleaning lady.<br/><br/>We also discover (thanks to Howl) that Sophie appears as a normal girl when she sleeps. One thing can be said for certain, this is a world where several cities or countries are involved in a war (with flying battleships and iron ships that look like US Civil War steamers) but even the Witch Of The Waste seems to have a Tardis-like Sedan chair, definitely bigger on the inside.<br/><br/>It's rather strange that whilst talking to the Kings Head Sorceror Sulliman (a mistranslation surely as she is clearly female) that Sophie briefly transforms into her younger self whilst making an impassioned speech on Howls behalf. Sulliman had also taken all the magic from The Witch Of The Waste and tried to trap Howl who saves Sophie.<br/><br/>Sophie escapes back to the castle and wakes up but is still young, checking on Howl she tells him she loves him. When he rejects her she becomes old again but it is difficult to know if that was a dream or not. Afer using Calcifer to move the Castle it also completely reconfigures and repairs the interior (again like another aspect of the Tardis, able to add new rooms), Sophie also appears to get younger again when Howl takes her into his secret garden.<br/><br/>From what I could understand Sophie gets younger when she acknowledges her feelings of love for Howl. Sophie is visited by her mother (who was forced to leave a spying bug by Sulliman) but it is destroyed by The Witch Of The Wastes using Calcifer to burn it but it leaves him weakened and unable to protect the house from invasion and bombing.<br/><br/>So many of the images of flying ships and burning birds remind of Battle Of The Planets (Gatchaman) it made me wonder if the maker of this had seen the cartoon as a child. Trying to help Howl Sophie removes Calcifer from the castle which destroys it but he is able to reconfigure it only smaller when she returns him and gives him her hair.<br/><br/>The magical scarecrow saves them from certain death and she kisses him which releases him from a spell, he turns out to be a missing Prince who can stop the war. Sulliman also stops the war using her royal contacts and calcifer repairs the castle and Sophie and Howl fly off into the sky.<br/><br/>It's an odd ending to an odd but sweet film which is apparently very loosely based on a novel by Diana Wynne Jones, the film is just under 2 hours long but I think it could be cut by about 20 minutes as it is just too long in places."

","One thing recognizable about Hayao's works is its uniquely honed story featuring a new overture of imagination; he never fails on that part. Howl's Moving Castle is another living proof of his untiring work of art, a masterpiece to be exact. The Movie intrigued me after seeing Spirited Away and some of Hayao's famous pieces like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso and Castle in the Sky are just some of his successful works.<br/><br/>Howl's moving castle isn't only and ideal imaginative anime one could witness. It is filled with inner depth and story of values one could appreciate. The story begins with Sofie, a young woman who lacks confidence later being cursed by a vindictive witch called ""Witch of the Wasteland"", and the only way to repel the curse is to find an unlikely immature young wizard named Howl. One remarkable facet of this animated movie is the upbringing of old chaotic wars into an unimaginable mix of existence of sorcery. The pace of the story doesn't saturate the mood by focusing only to the main characters. There are later revelations and reconciliations that made the story more likable. One good thing about Hayao Miyazaki's mood of story is that it doesn't spoil the movie's story by the usual predictable flow, but it will make one amazed with new twists and atmosphere. And most of all is how the Movie characterized the environment of the story, it rather creates and ecosystem one could appreciate how the movie occurs (well even though it is an animated film).<br/><br/>Overall it is an outstanding achievement for Miyazaki, though it didn't win an Oscar, its still worth to collect and admire."

","In an alternate world where magic is taken granted, a young woman named Sophie Hatter, lives a quiet life. While her sister gets all the attention in the world, Sophie has accepted a far less visible role as a silent woman who works in the back room of her family shop. Then one day, by a misunderstanding, Sophie angers a powerful Witch of the Waste, who transforms Sophie to an old woman. Sophie starts to look for a possible cure for the spell and ends up working in a moving castle, run by Howl, a young sorcerer with a questionable reputation. How will a headstrong young/old woman who has finally started to come out of her shell manage with a vain and self-centered sorcerer, who might be her only hope?<br/><br/>""Howl's Moving Castle"" (Hauru no ugoku shiro, 2004) is loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel of the same name. Those who have read the book, especially if they loved it, should prepare themselves that although settings and the characters are mostly the same, the movie does not follow book from word to word, but makes its own version of the same situation. There are some rather notable changes; like that Howl's young student is much younger in the film than he was in the book. However, the themes of the book are present in the film, as well as characters have retained their personalities mostly. Wynne Jones herself gave the film her blessing and enjoyed it, so I guess there is no harm done.<br/><br/>Technically the film is once again a delight from maestro Hayao Miyazaki, though it doesn't reach the heights of his previous works. The many details of the alternative, very European looking, world and the moving castle itself (which gives the feeling that it will fall to pieces any given moment) are amazing to watch. Joe Hisaishi also delivers once again a beautiful score to the film, also very European sounding. From the voice acting department I can only comment on the great original Japanese ones, though I've heard that the English dub is not too bad either. Biggest difference would probably be that in Japanese audio Sophie only has one voice actress, whereas in English dub her young and old self are voiced by two different women.<br/><br/>After such amazing masterpieces as ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"" is a slight step back in Miyazaki's career. However, it certainly is not a bad film and easily outshines majority of western animations of the past five years. A recommendable film."

","Every now and then I watch a movie that simply blows me away, and Howl's Moving Castle is one of them. I am no stranger to the films of Hayao Miyazaki, but for some odd reason I seemed to have always managed to have missed this particular Miyazaki classic. I finally picked up the film, and I can definitely say it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The big draw of this film is the imaginative animation. The animation is as fluid as ever, just like every other Studio Ghibli production. The animation under Miyazaki's direction is simply perfect, creating certain shots where you are simply left in awe, wondering how someone could have come up with a shot that is so fantastical. Of course what truly keeps you captivated to these tales crafted by Miyazaki is the story. This film's story is a surreal love story about a wizard and a bewitched human; it is a quirky, yet lovable premise. It is lighthearted and fun, featuring quirky and unique characters, alongside some breathtaking fantasy, both staples in Miyazaki films. The story of the film is complex, but never gets convoluted, it is well paced and never feels as if it is rushing or going too slow. Two more things worth mention is the magical score from Joe Hisaishi, and the wonderful voice acting; in particular from Christian Bale, who steals each scene as the voice of Howl.<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle is easily one of the most imaginative films ever made. Every time you see the gigantic lumbering castle, made up of rundown houses and pieces of scrap metal, you get this great feeling of excitement and wonder which truly takes you back to the days of your carefree childhood. Hayao Miyazaki has done it yet again, it is another instant classic.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 out of 10!"

","American title: ""Howl's Moving Castle""<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with previous films from this group will find the development and maturation of a young woman (in this case, Sofi) familiar territory. What changes in this compared with previous movies are the challenges she must face, the self-doubts she must overcome on her way to eventual triumph.<br/><br/>I hadn't realized the movie was loosely adapted from an English novel in which it was made clear that the name ""Howl"" is a contraction of ""Howell"". I found reading the IMDb Message Board comments on this film to be enormously helpful in my understanding of the movie and would have appreciated seeing the movie even more with the knowledge that gave.<br/><br/>For instance, I didn't realize Sofi was also a witch with magical powers or that her sudden old age was partially a result of her own self-doubts about her appearance and vitality. Nor did I sufficiently realize how much Howl was sometimes less than honorable, trustworthy, and dependable.<br/><br/>But even without that, the movie was satisfying and enjoyable. The artwork was the best ever (IMO) by Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli and was visually stunning."

","Diana Wynne Jones novel is adopted by film-making legend Hayao Miyazaki to create a subtle classic.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Sophie, a simple city girl with low self esteem, who works in a hat shop in a Eurasian-fantasy country plagued by war. The local celebrity, Howl, is a mysterious magician about whom rumors fly like flocks of pigeons. After a chance meeting with the sorcerer, and an unfortunate encounter with a more infamous personality, the Witch of the Waste, Sophie is transformed into an elderly version of herself. In seeking a way to avert the curse, Sophie finds herself caught up in the twisted politics of the conflict, but more importantly, she discovers that it truly is love, in this case, the love of a family, that is the cure for war.<br/><br/>What makes this story so brilliant is that the environment is removed from our earth completely, so that no racial structure or borders can be identified. This reveals the true madness of conflict, which is used as the background for the kind of enchanting story that one might curl up with on a rainy day--or even a sunny one. Studio Ghibli's textbook superior visions are on display once again to push forward the technical quality of the film, and the capable U.S. production team and cast have presented the story in a way that does justice to the visuals. For those who are thrown by the message, think nothing of it--it took me a few viewings as well. But I did come to realize that this is actually a rather powerful allegory for our own war-torn world, and the things that really matter within--the desire to love, be loved, and shun yourself for others based on that love. Perhaps, like a fine wine, it will gain appreciation with the passage of time."

","The production quality is first rate. I have seen Princess Mononoke in the theatre and Hauru has the same production style and quality. The background scenics are very moody and quite suitable to the environment that existed at that time. Definitely not your typical animation movie! Of course, the subject matter, too, is not your typical animation movie!<br/><br/>The story is based on the 'dream' states we all have in animation. You can tell this as you view the movie - this one is from the heart and from real life. That's why it is so powerful and so accurate in its depiction of events and life at that time. The base story line is derived from a traditional Japanese storytelling method, which is why the events are told in the manner that they are in the film. Even though you know what the outcome will be at the start, this does not lessen its impact once you get there at the end of the film."

","The action of Hayao Miyazaki's latest animated fantasy takes place in an undetermined place and age, though it looks like the late 19th century (allowing for a number of anachronistic details) in a Central European kingdom (the Austro Hungarian empire of the time seems the country where the action takes place, and the book happens in a place called Ingary, though the kingdom in the movie has a large port by the sea, which the Austro Hungarian empire didn't). The story starts with a young woman called Sophie working in a hat factory who is suddenly turned into a 90 year woman through a curse by some witch. She then tries to meet the wizard Howl, to see if he can help her. As it later turns out, Howl faces some curses of its own. The story soon becomes very convoluted, almost impossible to follow it wholly in just one sighting. After a while, you give up on understanding everything that is going on, and concentrate on enjoying its vivid details (Howl's literal melting of sadness is probably my favorite scene). What I found most engaging about the movie, rather than certain aspects of the plot, is its background details, which betrays Miyazaki's love for Victorian fantasy. I haven't read the original book, I know some people who had has taken issue with Miyazaki's liberties with the plot, but as it is, this is a very enjoyable movie to watch, even if the ending is a bit preachy in its endorsement of pacifism and environmentalism."

If you agree with me when I say these examples show the brilliant fantasy of Hayao Miyazaki and truly prove the reputation Studio Ghibli enjoys to be right, you will probably also cheer at the end of the movie, just like I did. <br/><br/>Inside the universe of fairy tales, I am happy to have the Studio Ghibli, since this is the only studio to create stories for children and adults as well.

The actors and actresses have put an incredible effort into making this movie and they should be very proud of their efforts. Thsi film targets not only children but all age and sex groups. Howl's Moving Castle has an excellent setting to compliment its characters and it is obvious it is set in Japan. This is an unmissable film and should be watched by all Anime movie lovers. The time and effort put into his movie must have taken ages and I think it is worth it in the end as it is probably the best anime film i have ever experienced watching.

"bob the moo","Null","0","3","25 October 2006"," Has areas where it could have been better but is still a fantastic little film with great animation, characters and plot
","Young Sophie is a plain girl who works in a hat store. When she meets the wizard Howl on her way home she finds herself protected by him as he flees from the demons of the Witch of the Waste. Later that night the Witch visits her in the shop and casts a spell turning her into an old woman but preventing her from telling anyone. Setting out into the wilderness, Sophie comes across Howl's castle and, thanks to a cheeky fire demon, settles in as the new cleaning woman while she can try and work out how to break her curse of old age. However while she retains her young heart in an old body, she learns that Howl has long since lost his heart and the pressure of wars is taking its toll on him.<br/><br/>Although it is inferior to Spirited Away in some areas, I scoff at those that heavily criticise Howl for this because this film is still a lot better than a lot of the ""Happy Meal marketing campaigns"" that are served up to our children as films. This film has the usual Miyazaki traits of imaginative visuals, a range of characters, magic, humour and an interesting plot that is more than just easy sentiment and cliché. I agree with those that have said it is hard to follow at times because, although the main thrust of the narrative is engaging, I did find it distracting to not totally understand things like Sophie drifting between degrees of age etc. However this still served to engage me as I tried to understand the meaning of it within the plot. The theme of hearts is well used within the film and, again although I didn't understand the narrative totally, I liked the meaning within the story about the importance of the heart within each person. It touched me and although the detail will go over most children's heads, hopefully it should impact upon them to some degree. The pace is pretty good for the most part but I was a bit disappointed with the delivery at the end  it was all neatly tied up and done very quickly; the downside of this being that it does feel a bit forced and obvious in contrast with the more controlled material up to that point (Turniphead's fate is a perfect and unnecessary example of what I mean).<br/><br/>The animation is typically beautiful and audiences should guard against accepting this as the standard simply because it is the case so often. I loved the look of the film, from the trademark things like the European feel to the cities, to the design and beauty of the flying machines right down to the usual mix of imagination within the characters. The characters are the usual delight as well  not afraid to make them ""ugly"" while also drawing beauty and goodness out of their hearts. Most obviously this is seen in the character of Sophie, who is never better than when she is old  how many other children's films would be confident enough in their audience to put an old woman in the lead role? Howl is just as interesting although his transformation may be hard to follow for younger viewers. Simmons and Mortimer are both good as Sophie although Simmons dominates her younger counterpart. Bale is always good value even if he could have benefited from a slower pace to develop his character better. Crystal is a joy as Calcifer and he adds humour and spark (sorry) to his scenes. Bacall is classy presence in a good character while I liked Hutcherson's turn as Markl.<br/><br/>Overall this is not the perfect film because the plot is not as easy to follow as it could have been and the heart (sorry) of the story could have been delivered in a more patient and slower manner, this isn't too much of a problem (although the ending is clumsy) and the majority of the film is strong enough to cover it. The animation is flawless and the characters enjoyable while the story has plenty of interest in there to hold the interest. Has areas where it could have been better but is still a fantastic little film for the family, children or adults."
"Jimi_01","8","0","2","8 October 2006"," A Masterful 'Love Will Conquer All' Fairytale
","With enough imagination to rival those boffins at Pixar, master animator Hayao Miyazaki (the Japanese Walt Disney) returns to the big screen with his follow up to the enchanting 'Spirited Away'. These days we are all too familiar with the 'Happy Meal' friendly characters brought to life by western animators through the wonders of CGI. However, this Japanese maestro distinctly resists the use of modern technology in favour of classical cel animation, which makes a refreshing change. Bored with her life in a sleepy town, the film's protagonist Sophie is cursed by an evil witch who transforms her into an elderly woman. Sophie escapes her village to a fantastical roaming castle, owned by the mysterious wizard Howl (voiced by Christian Bale). Howl's Moving Castle is a 'love will conquer all' fairytale that sees Sophie battle to reverse her altered state as she slowly falls for Howl's charms. Some of the visuals are quite Gothic and at times resemble the animated sketches used in Monty Python's Flying Circus. The animation is flawless throughout, engulfing the viewer in a truly bizarre world, whilst simultaneously elevating the film's more fragile moments that comment on war, greed and lost youth."

","Wonderful film. Images are magnificent, and they become more poetic with the dreaming music of the Howl and Sophie's flying sequence. I just can't understand how Wallace & Gromit  The curse of the were-rabbit won the Oscar. Of course, this film is all the same inferior than Tim Burton's Corpse bride. The story is about a young hatter, Sophie, who casually meets Howl, a wizard. But a baleful witch misunderstands the sort of their relationship and transforms the poor girl into an old woman. So, Sophie becomes the governess of the Howl's moving castle. Hayao Miyazaki is a great, not only in in the extent of Japanese animes, but he is a master of the world animation: for example, you must see the sequence of Howl and Sophie's flight. Miyazaki includes all of his favourite themes: the metamorphosis, the flight, a girl lead. Congratulations to the score by Joe Hisaishi."

So I was real skeptical on liking this one when I hated the others. Well imagine my surprise when not only did I like this movie,but have watched it a total of 7 times(about to be eight once I finish writing this review LOL!)just to see the memorable,lovable characters. I guarantee that if you don't like anything else you will love them. They are so endearing. Even the sub-characters make this movie.<br/><br/>Plot: Sadly, if I was going strictly by plot when rating this movie I'll give it a 4 because it needed some huge work,but happily I went with the flow because the characters are so great.<br/><br/>Characters. I LOVE them. You have Howl a vain, effeminate,metrosexual,cowardly wizard that literally has no heart,and is voiced by Cristian Bale. Let me just say Bale's voice MADE Howl. It is sexy as hell. I have re-watched Howl's scenes over, and over, and over just to hear him speak!Sophie a young women who's confidence is so low that she thinks she's ugly,and has a spell put on her by a obese witch(seriously)that is obsessed with Howl for some reason,and who turns Sophie old. She try's to find away to break the curse and ends up in Howls Castle. Howl and Old Sophie play well of each other,and the ending is so sweet.If you are wandering yes her and Howl get together eventually.When she's old her confidence is higher then it ever was when she was young.The there's Cacifer a wisecracking,hilarious fire demon who has a strange link to Howl. He is voiced perfectly by Billy Crystal.Lastly out of the main characters is a young apprentice of Howl's who's sweet,and funny also.<br/><br/>Music. Most is very good. Almost eerie in some parts.<br/><br/>Visuals: Good for hand-drawn animation.<br/><br/>Bottomline: If you just don't like Japanese animation ,but want to see this movie rent it or watch it on you-tube like I did. The characters make this movie and just to see them in action I implore you to check this movie out. Forget the shaky plot(First and last time I'll ever say that. That is how fantastic the characters are)and just watch for them. 6 1/2 stars"

","From the Oscar winning director of 'spirited away' comes this fine Japanese animation. It tell the story of a girl who is turned into an old woman by an evil witch and then seeks refuge in the castle of a wizard, howl, disguised as a cleaning lady. This has all the magical and fantastical elements you would expect from the mind of a mad Japanese animator. It pure fantasy and freedom the kind you can only do in a cartoon. It looks great the style is amazing and it's the attention to detail that stands out as far as the graphics go, howl's castle as it walks round the land wobbling and creaking like a huge engine. It is just a delight that adults and kids alike can sit together and enjoy this film for all sorts of different reasons. From wildly bizarre to oddly strange the story twists so many times you never know where it's going to end up and by the end I still had no idea. I think that is where some of this films charms are, in that it doesn't have to make sense to be enjoyed its just so mystical and aesthetically pleasing. Disney and Pixar have very good looking computer generated films that are funny but if you want to see a film with a real soul and old school animation right at its heart then you can't go far wrong with howl's."

On the DVD version I have there is a feature on the use of CG; it is incredible the lengths they take to match the CG and hand-drawn animation together - well worth watching!

","This is a Hayao Miyazaki film therefore there are a few things you can expect, a young girl, some adventures, strange fairy tale land and a voyage of self discovery. Of course the film does not disappoint all these elements are there. There is a sense that the film has some wider world elements that set it apart from other Miyazaki movies. This mainly comes from the backdrop of an Orwell 1984 type war with seemingly irrelevant sides and aims. This is developing into a common theme in Japanese cinema at the moment, perhaps unsurprisingly considering that is what the rest of the world is talking about. However the Japanese take on it is always a little obvious and is drilled home to such a degree it is less thought provoking. However it is a visually stunning film where the characters and plot are well developed. There are numerous quirky characters to keep younger movie goers entertained, although I haven't seen the dubbed versions so some of this may be lost in translation. All in all a good modern ""Brothers Grimm"" type tale. If you only watch one Miyazaki film watch ""Spirited Away"" if you want to see a few more this isn't a bad place to go next."

","HOWL is another feature-length 2D cartoon by the Walt Disney of Japan, Miyazaki. This time around, we have a disparate group of people suffering under various curses who find their way together and form a ragtag family to fight the forces of evil -- in this case, a seemingly never-ending war between two nations. Having said this, I will say HOWL is suitable for even the youngest viewer, because Miyasaki knows how to make such subject matter palatable for even the youngest among us. While not his best work, it is absolutely gorgeous and almost hallucinatory as it tells the story of a walking castle and its owner, a shy young warlock. In some scenes, the castle is CGI; in others, it is standard 2D. Either way, it is a marvel and at the heart of the story, which is loosely based on a novel by legendary fantasy author Diana Jones. Emily Mortimer plays Sophie, the heroine of the story. Christian Bale is Howl. Billy Crystal is the fire that keeps Howl's castle together (don't ask), and he is very funny. A mute scarecrow plays an equally important role. Highly recommended. Make sure you also catch SPIRITED AWAY, PRINCES MONONOKE, NAUSICAA and MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO by this animation genius. He also is responsible for KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, PORCO ROSSO and CASTLE IN THE SKY, and contributed to the delightful THE CAT RETURNS."

","I have and always will love Hayao Miyazaki's films. I first descovered him when I saw もののけ姫(US ""Princess Mononoke"") when it first hit the cinema. Howl's moving castle is his second adaptation of a novel by the same writer (The first being ""Castle in the sky"") and his latest film. It opens fairly quickly with not a lot of time to establish the characters, but then after a few other goes-by-fast events, the movie starts into an acceptable pace. Sophie is a young girl working for a hat-shop in a witch and wizard version of Europe. One of the most well known Wizards- Howl lives inside a giant legged castle, and is commonly believed to come down and steal the hearts (literally) of young and beautiful women. When the watch of the waste comes into the hat shop, after a brief argument of sorts, curses Sophie and turns her into an old woman. She then flees her town to the wastes in hope of finding a way to have the spell broken, and along the way finds a cursed scarecrow whom she asks to find a place to stay- and finds Sophie Howl's castle. When inside she meets Calcifur, a demon of flame who promises her he would break her curse if she freed him from Howl, he uses him as a slave. I do not know how close this adaptation is to the novel, as I have never read it, or even heard of the authors name until recently. This movie is extremely well done, as with Miyazaki's other films, but when it comes to Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, or any of his other films, Howl's moving castle falls short. It's lacking some of what made his original films so unique (Not to say it doesn't have some of that style) and doesn't feel as fresh or interesting as his others."

","Possibly the most theme-driven of Miyazaki's fantasies. The director has almost totally forsaken plot in favor of visually transporting flights of the imagination. The big visual set pieces are presented quite matter-of-factly (Sofi's first encounter with the moving castle, for example) and the build to the climax is strangely casual. Still, the film, like all of Miyazaki's work, is extraordinarily inventive and revisits familiar themes and motifs. The character mix has close parallels with ""Spirited Away"", just as the dark, oily forces of evil resemble army's of the former film's 'No Face' character. The Joe Hisaishi music is strong but not amazing, and both the Japanese and American voice actors acquit themselves well. The film is not engaging on a visceral level, but it is filled with enormous warmth and rich humanity. And, for me, the most wonderful character who truly personifies the Miyazaki world is the bouncing scarecrow."

","This is another of Mayao Miazaki's masterpieces. The story is solid, the characters are interesting & unique, the animation is breathtaking. The story arc of Sophie's journey is fairly straightforward. Howl's adventures, however, are much more complicated & leave much to the imagination. The war he fights is never explained. I have read articles saying that villains in Miazaki's movies are never really all bad. The witch of the waste in this movie was used as an example. I somewhat disagree. While the witch was indeed on the darker side of the moral spectrum, she was not the true villain. The king character, whose motives are never clarified in the dub, seems to be bad with no redeeming qualities. So there goes that theory. I've heard a rumor that this will be Miazaki's last film. It does contain references to his other films throughout, such as the black ooze characters, which strongly resemble Noh Face from Spirited Away. It would be appropriate for him to pay homage to his earlier works if he is indeed no longer going to make films. It also creates a very sad blanket over the film."

","OK, you'll have to bear with me, this is my first movie review...<br/><br/>Howl's Moving Castle continues Miyazaki's legacy of superb animation combined with an original, imaginative story. A wizard set in a future world of warring nations who uses magic to make his semi-industrial, semi-medieval castle move about on spindly legs? Brilliant! <br/><br/>Whilst being a romance first and foremost, the film still contains elements of the comic and the sinister. Non-speaking characters such as the scarecrow and the dog are almost a given now in Miyazaki's films, whose actions bridge cultural differences when it comes to comedy, and we also see the return of the wrinkly old lady - another trademark of Miyazaki's recent films. The dark, mysterious side of Howl that the viewer learns of gradually through the film counter-balances the comedy well as to produce a film that has real feeling.<br/><br/>Billy Crystal really hits the character of Calcifer spot-on in his voice-over, which makes a refreshing change for those of you who are not fans of Japanese films being re-voiced into English.<br/><br/>Finally, although the film is a gem, I can't help feeling a little disappointed in the ending. I can't say too much about it, but it did leave me feeling that the genius Miyazaki is could have done better."
"ignatiusloyala","7","0","1","30 October 2005"," Yet another Miyazaki anime
","Howl's moving castle is a very Miyazaki anime. And like the recent Miyazaki amines, e.g. Spirited Away, this is a slight let-down. <br/><br/>I don't know whether it is intended in the original or whether the adaptation just wasn't good, but the plot of the movie is rather thin. It's set in a warring European state (Germany? Austria?) and there's this sorcerer, Howl, who wants to use his power to stop this war. Impressive, but not quite there. The fact that this subplot seems so weighty but weakly developed makes it ultimately look superfluous. So is Howl's obsession with beauty and the involvement of the Queen of the Dump. <br/><br/>There's a lot of dazzle in the movie (walking and flying in the air, exploring Howl's past, Califer's powering the moving castle) like Spirited Away, but like Spirited Away, the film floats on too thin a plot to make it memorable like Miyazaki's previous works. And in fact, Spirited Away and Howl's moving Castle share a lot of common elements (a monster/animal/what-do-you-call-it turned human, which or who can fly, an ingenuous girl brought to a place full of magic, black-shadow like demons, etc) one constantly reminds the audience of the other.<br/><br/>While still enjoyable on the whole, the lack of freshness of the storyline renders it an anime with a Miyazaki plot built on a different set."
