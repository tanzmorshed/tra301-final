","The trailer for the movie had me scratching my head but as a HUGE fan of Waititi I felt I ought to give it a shot.<br/><br/>My best spoiler free review is that this is an original, outrageous film. The emotional gamut we are subjected to is whiplash inducing, but without the neck brace and ambulance chasing lawyers.<br/><br/>Every actor is perfection. Young JoJo and Yorkie are devastatingly earnest and so talented. Sam Rockwell is always a master. Every subtle satire is underwritten with a grim level of truth. The soundtrack n unexpected choice.<br/><br/>Go see it. Prepare yourself for quite a ride."

"ferguson-6","8","261","341","1 November 2019"," wacky with feeling
","Greetings again from the darkness. Welcome to the most divisive movie of the year. Some will scoff at the idea and deride the filmmaker without ever even seeing the movie. Some will relay disgust after seeing the movie. A few won't appreciate the style or structure, and will fail to find the humor. Ah yes, but some of us will embrace Taika Waititi's wacky adaptation of Christine Leunens' 2018 novel ""Caging Skies"" as one of the funniest and most heart-warming films of the year ... fully acknowledging that many won't see it our way.<br/><br/>One wouldn't be off base in asking why a successful filmmaker would tackle such a risky project: a coming-of-age comedy-drama-fantasy about a 10 year old Nazi fanatic who has as his imaginary friend, not a 6 foot rabbit, but the Fuhrer himself, Adolph Hitler. After all, writer-director Waititi is coming off a couple of brilliant indies (2014's WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and 2016's HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE) and a major score with Marvel money on THOR: RAGNAROK (2017), arguably the most entertaining superhero movie of the past few years. He certainly could have continued to cash in with 'safer' choices; however, Mr. Waititi sees the world differently than most of us. He finds humor in the drudgery, and humanity in malevolence. He's also a bit goofy.<br/><br/>Playing over the opening credits is the German version of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", as we see old clips of German citizens cheering for Adolph Hitler in a similar manner to how fans used to scream for The Beatles. World War II is nearing the end as we meet 10 year old Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo is fervent in his fanaticism towards the Nazi way, and buys into the belief that Jews are monsters with horns on their head. He's such a believer that his imaginary friend is actually Hitler, well at least a bumbling boisterous version played by the filmmaker himself - enacted to extreme comedy effect (recalling a bit of Chaplin in THE GREAT DICTATOR). Mel Brooks managed to play Hitler to a laughable extreme in ""Springtime for Hitler"" in THE PRODUCERS, but the only thing missing her from Waititi's costume is an old timey dunce cap.<br/><br/>Jojo lives at home with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while dad is off fighting on the front line. Ms. Johansson's performance is terrific (despite limited screen time) as she creates a believably warm bond with her son during horrific times. Soon, Jojo is off to a Nazi camp designed to teach the boys how to fight (and burn books), as the girls learn the virtues of having babies. The camp leaders are Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who is a bit of a joke on the surface, but more interesting the deeper we dig; Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who boasts of having 18 Aryan babies; and Finkel (Alfie Allen) a violent psychopath. At camp with Jojo is his best friend Yorki (newcomer and scene-stealer Archie Yates), and the two show what a genuine friendship can be as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Things change quickly for Jojo when, by happenstance, he discovers a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home. Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, LEAVE NO TRACE) shows none of the characteristics that Jojo has been brainwashed into believing all Jews possess. She has no horns, flashes a good sense of humor, and is actually very nice and knowledgeable. In other words, she's no monster. As they get to know each other, Jojo realizes this ""nice"" Jewish girl contrasts starkly with his lunatic hero Adolph.<br/><br/>Waititi's film is ingenious satire, and it likely won't sit well with those who think not enough time has passed to justify making fun of Nazi atrocities. It's funny and heavy, and deals with some thought-provoking matter in an unusual way. The ""Heil Hitler"" count approaches the 'F-word' frequency of most Tarantino movies, and there is a German Shepherd gag that caught the audience off-guard. Stephen Merchant's Gestapo search of Jojo's house is comedy at its weirdest. The movie messes with your head as it's some odd blend of SCHINDLER'S LIST, ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", and an extended Monty Python skit.<br/><br/>It's rare for a film that borders on slapstick at times to have so many touching and emotional moments. The actors are really strong here, especially Ms. Johansson and Ms. McKenzie, who as gutsy Elsa, proves again she is quickly becoming a powerhouse young actor. Roman Griffin Davis carries a significant weight in the story despite being a first time actor, and I can't emphasize enough how young Archie Yates will steal your heart while he's stealing his scenes. Michael Giacchino's score and Mihai Malaimaire Jr's terrific cinematography work well with Waititi's vision ... a satirical vision that would never work outside of his unique filmmaking talent. The story is basically proof of the adage, 'Kill 'em with kindness', when what we are really killing is hatred. At its core, this is a story of humanity and human nature, and how we grab hold of the wrong thing until the truth becomes evident. Now, please pass the unicorn."
"exiledreplicant","10","334","453","9 September 2019"," Endearing and Hilarious
","This was another of Taika at his best. Taking him back to his bittersweet indie roots, his storytelling and humanity shows through at every moment. A story of a 10 year old nazi youth in full swing of his country's ideology indoctrination, he starts his journey with his invisible best friend Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi himself) going off to Hitler Youth camp. His mother is a wild and endearing woman with a playful attitude during this horrible time of war. The movie starts off hilariously, but it takes a little bit of time to allow yourself to feel okay laughing at this side of the german war and this little boy who wants nothing more than to do right by his fuhrer. After a terrible (and hilariously acted) accident, and the discovery that his mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their attic, his ideals are turned upside down to the thoughts on the war he has grown up with. It's a simple message delivered in a way that tells you what you already know. Facism is bad. It's a story that Taika tells us needs to be told over and over again, because people easily turn a blind eye to the horrors of humankind, but heart and love can prevail. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie are a great pair and carry the film with warmth and wonderful comedic scenes, but it's Scarlett Johansson who leaves us with the memory of what it means to be on the right side of humanity, and to take life as it comes and teach your children what you can, when you can. Even surrounded by well-known and substantial actors, these two children stand out and bring the movie's warm embrace. Taika is never afraid to lead with a joke, but he always takes the time to bring his message of humanity home by hanging on the sad moments of life too, not jumping over life's tragedies to get to the next one-liner. He balances the good with the bad perfectly, leaving you walking away with a warm feeling in your belly."

"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","240","343","18 September 2019"," A heartfelt satire needed for today
","Probably one of the most controversial films to come out of TIFF, I went into Jojo Rabbit with cautionious optimism since I am fan of Taika Waititi while still being aware of the divineness it has spawned in some critics. I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.<br/><br/>Jojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's ""kind"", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.<br/><br/>The smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself.
Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.<br/><br/>The cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a na√Øve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first."
"gregoryblanch88","9","33","42","29 February 2020"," There is hope
","Jojo Rabbit demonstrates that there is hope, both for humanity and Hollywood. By the latter I mean it's hard to imagine how a film this original got made in an era of reboots, remakes, sequels and prequels (mostly bad)<br/><br/>The characters are charming and quirky, the dialogue clever and the plot wisely confines itself to telling an intensely personal story rather than one of the war itself. The young male star is perfect, and the other performances shine as well. It does seem though that Scarlett got less time on the screen than she deserves.<br/><br/>The director cleverly doesn't show us certain things, and a lot of good choices were made in the editing room.<br/><br/>Hollywood, if you're listening, more like this please."

"pere-25366","8","135","223","16 September 2019"," Inventive, hilarious and original - ""Jojo"" is a ballsy film that works because of its wit and heart - 8/10 ‚≠ê
","I was fortunate enough to catch <a href=""/name/nm0169806/"">Taika Waititi</a>'s latest film at the 2019 TIFF People's Choice Screening and what an absolute treat it was. In this ""anti-hate satire"", we follow the trials and tribulations of a German boy who finds a Jewish girl living in his attic and is confronted with a clash of his conditioned values as a little nazi boy. If you think the synopsis sounds crazy, you have no idea what you're in for...<br/><br/>Though seemingly taking inspiration from the works of Wes Anderson and Mel Brooks, ""Jojo"" manages to create something in an entirely new ball park pulling off a spoof that manages to be hilarious while not disrespecting its touchy subject matter, a feat that only the wonderful Taika (who directed, wrote and acted as Imaginary Hitler in) could pull off so well. The film also boasts some killer cinematography as well as a wonderful soundtrack, both of which punctuate some of the films quieter moments to ground us in the era and atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, Taiki plays the titular boy's imaginary Hitler friend and leaves you weak in the stomach from laughing so much - he's, quite simply, hilarious. And yet, he doesn't manage to overpower the rest of the cast which includes Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Jo and Rebel Wilson all of whom are wonderful. But most notably, it's the child performances that take center stage. The two little leads are incredible, making us laugh at times, shed a tear at others and just feel for the two of them. Their comedic timing, range and overall performances are done to a T - it's because of them the film works as well as it does.<br/><br/>In today's day and age, more than ever, people need a reason to just sit back and smile and this makes ""Jojo Rabbit"" a truly timely film. Leave it to Mr. Waititi to take one of the most gruesome periods in human history and, believe it or not, find both a humour and beauty in its telling. It's also entirely original in its execution and is perhaps the perfect example of the kind of film Hollywood could use more of. All that's left to say is thanks for the laughs Taika; and for your brilliantly twisted mind!"
"Azanspy","9","61","96","5 February 2020"," Taika Waititi is one of the best directors in Hollywood right now.
","JoJo Rabbit is a brilliant and brave attempt by Taika Waititi. This movie is crafted by pure creativity. 'An anti hate satire' is the tagline of the movie and the movie shows the Nazi era difficulties through humour and mind blowing dialogue (most from Scarlett Johansson). This was the year that I realised ScaJoh is an excellent actress. All of the cast was excellent including Roman Griffin Davies, Thomasin McKenzie (who both have a bright future), Taika Waititi, Rebel Wilson and an excellent Sam Rockwell. The fat boy also deserves mentioned. JoJo Rabbit deserves acclaim and more people should see it. I don't know why most of the critics hated it but screw them. Jojo Rabbit deserved that Oscar nod for Best Picture and even though there's no hope for winning it, I'm pretty sure the movie has inspired so much hearts and this movie will discussed in the future."
"ajzeg","10","17","23","29 February 2020"," This movie is fantastic!
","It's a really weird idea, it's a cutesy Wes Anderson/Calvin & Hobbes-style comedy about a little boy, his imaginary friend and his adventures growing up. It just so happens that that little boy is a Hitler Youth, his imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler and he's growing up in Nazi Germany during WWII. This movie is very funny. It has a ton of comedy both light and very dark! Don't be fooled, though. This is less The Producers or Look Who's Back and more Life is Beautiful. There are some seriously heavy and tragic parts in this movie that I don't dare spoil here. While it is a commentary about how childish the whole idea of Naziism is, it is also about the horrors of indoctrination and intolerance and the damages they can inflict. Great performances, beautiful costumes and cinematography and with a brilliant script, this is a must-see! One of my favourites of 2019!"

"meathookcinema","10","60","104","2 January 2020"," Funny, Poignant, Irreverent. The Guardian Hated It!
","Jojo is a proud Hitler Youth member. He decides to go on a weekend for fellow brainwashed enthusiasts. However, after a (very funny) accident with a grenade he finds himself hospitalised. At home recovering he discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home. He confides this to his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (!)<br/><br/>This film is actually a comedy! An off the wall, zany and irreverant comedy that works beautifully. It was a massive gamble to make such a film in such oversensitive and 'woke' times. And it was Disney of all studios that made Jojo Rabbit! Should such a terrible period from history be depicted in such a chirpy and comical way? Should Hitler be portrayed as such a goofball within the film? YES! Whether it's Mel Brooks (who said he loved JoJo Rabbit) with The Producers and it's musical Springtime For Hitler or Joan Rivers making her controversial joke about the Holocaust on Fashion Police, humour reaches the parts that more earnest and serious pieces of 'art' can't. It forces you to laugh at whatever is the target of the joke is and then analyse why you laughed at something that you normally wouldn't see as comical.<br/><br/>Whilst most critics have lauded the film, there are peripheral pundits who have either said that the filmmakers have gone too far (How dare they make a comedy starring Adolf Hitler?!) or that they didn't go far enough (How dare they make a film about Nazi Germany and not show the full horror of what happened?!). The Guardian hated the film which is another reason for audiences go and see this gem of a film.<br/><br/>But, understandably, everything depicted in the film isn't just for laughs. There are plenty of gut-wrenching moments when the full horror is brought home to the characters and audience alike. These poignant sequences aren't milked for all their worth and this makes them all the more powerful and genuine. There were a couple of pivotal scenes which made me fight back tears. These scenes were played out for what they were without the whole film descending into a tissue-soaking cry-a-thon which would have cheapened and devalued the movie's content.<br/><br/>The film also looks beautiful with set designs and a colour palate that makes Jojo Rabbit a feast for the eyes. This film is beautifully constructed. Jojo's room, the house in which he resides, the cubby hole that houses Elsa and the surrounding environs are all aesthetically pleasing and a joy to behold.<br/><br/>Also, check out the framing. Every scene feels just as quirky, off-kilter and as warped as the narrative. Watch out for the scene on the giant steps and the later scene with it's emphasis on a character's shoes and how this motif is used later on in the film in an extremely heartbreaking but dignified and tasteful way.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also fantastic with The Beatles' German language version of I Wanna Hold Your Hand ('Komm, gib mir deine Hand') and Bowie's Helden leading the way. In fact, these two rather obscure (to English eyes anyway) versions of well known songs normally heard in their Mother Tongue depict the whole feel of the film- off kilter, eschew and very original.<br/><br/>There are uniformly amazing performances by the likes of Roman Griffin Davis playing Jojo, Scarlett Johannsen as his mother, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa the Jewish hideaway and Sam Rockwell (great to see him taking more risks with his choice of roles after starring in the ultra-woke and unbearable Three Billboards). Also, look out for Stephen Merchant as a very sinister Nazi inspector. He reminded me of The Demon Headmaster. But it's director and screenwriter Taika Waititi who plays Adolf Hitler who steals the show. Every scene that hes in is comedy gold as he depicts Hitler as a kind of bro/dude best friend to Jojo. His lines and mannerisms are laugh out loud hysterical.<br/><br/>4 parts humour, 1 part sentiment, this film has a power that will seep into your brain during it's running time and stay with you long after the film is over. In fact my first thought on leaving the cinema was that I wanted to see it again.<br/><br/>I feel privileged to have seen one of the best films of 2020 on Jan the 1st of this year. A cracking start to a new decade of movies."

The beginning was the quirky silliness I expected (I love it but also realize not everyone does). Then, well let's avoid spoilers and just say things got complicated.And that's when JoJo went from absurdist comedy (Think Life of Brian only with Hitler) to something more like a Chaplin comedy, the kind that has who laughing one moment and crying the next.
I loved the look and feel of it. Sometimes it has a cartoon feel about it but the characters are three dimensional, full of emotion.<br/><br/>This could have been silly, could have been hideously offensive but some how Waititi and cast pulled it all together.

","""Jojo Rabbit"" is a light-hearted comedy exploring dark elements. It tells the story of a 10-year-old boy growing up in Germany near the end of World War II. He's a lot like other boys his age, struggling to fit in and find his way, searching for group and sense of belonging. Unlike a lot of boys his age, he is a passionate Nazi who gleefully exclaims, ""Heil Hitler!"" as he skips down the street to a camp for young Nazis-in-training. Accompanying him as he skips, cheering him on, is his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, himself.<br/><br/>Hitler, played with uproarious levels of buffoonery by writer/director Taika Waititi, provides many of the film's early laughs. Sadly, the movie fails to deliver on its early promise. It doesn't crash burn - the end product is still respectable - but all the parts never totally come together in a completely satisfying way. We hope for more from a proven entity like Waititi.<br/><br/>The title ""Jojo Rabbit,"" as it turns out, is half the name of the 10-year-old boy and half the name of a cute, fluffy animal. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) becomes the begrudging recipient of the nickname ""Jojo Rabbit"" for his choice to not coldly murder an innocent rabbit while at Nazi camp. An older boy makes a different choice regarding the rabbit, then callously chucks the body across the woods.<br/><br/>Jojo doesn't fit in here. He doesn't want to be a Nazi. He just doesn't know it yet.<br/><br/>Jojo lives with his loving, playful mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), who secretly works for the resistance. However, she allows Jojo to follow his misguided Nazi ways, knowing this will keep him safe from party members who search the town for dissenters. Johansson plays the part with impressive layers of complexity. While appalled by her son's Nazi passion, she understands that now is not the time to reprimand him. She quietly does her work and continues to love her son dearly, which is precisely why she opts not to tell Jojo about the young Jewish girl she is hiding in her wall.<br/><br/>When Jojo finds the girl (Thomasin McKenzie), he is shocked and horrified. But he quickly discovers that she isn't at all the way Jews have been described to him. ""Where are your horns?"" He asks her sincerely.<br/><br/>It's not long before Jojo begins to realize the girl he has been told is a monster is actually a friend, while his imaginary friend is the real monster. If you've seen any movies before, you know this is coming. Nevertheless, a few moments successfully tug at the heart strings. Another moment doesn't work quite as well and ends up feeling forced, even manipulative.<br/><br/>The movie's execution winds up being a bit disappointing because of how much potential seemed possible in the opening act. The best moments are the funniest ones, usually featuring Hitler and Jojo, along with a few others that include the scene-stealing Archie Yates, who plays Jojo's friend.<br/><br/>Despite the movie's success in comedic execution, the heavier material waivers, leaving the vision of the story a bit foggy. What could have been a best-of-the-year contender, winds up being merely an above average comedy."
"truemythmedia","6","177","356","26 November 2019"," Over-rated and Over-hyped
","Taika Waititi (""Thor Ragnarok"") is an auteur who I really respect, a lot. He has an incredibly unique, soulful, and humorous sensibility which, despite walking through dark themes and imagery at times, always seems to find a settled place in hope and peace. He has been able to keep this soul throughout films about vampires, foster care, parental death, and even the MCUs ""Thor Ragnarok,"" one of the best entries into the MCU Canon.<br/><br/>It is a rare thing when a truly unique voice is given the opportunity to make a blockbuster like Thor and even more rare that they manage to maintain their artistic integrity as they do so. Considering this, I was eager to see ""Jojo Rabbit,"" apparently the film you make after a smashingly successful first go at a major Hollywood blockbuster and the cache' that success garners you, at least, that is, if you are Taika Waititi.<br/><br/>The concept of this film is the other half of the draw, for me and, most likely, for many people who have seen the trailer. It's a pretty wild concept to look at the fall of the German Reich from the perspective of a naive wide-eyed eager young boy who is actually a pretty big fan of Hitler and really hates Jews. As I sat down to watch this film, I had moments where I hoped I was about to see something akin to ""Death of Stalin,"" poignant and cutting satire that leaned hard into its themes, with a dash of ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" childhood antics and adulting.<br/><br/>In this regard, the film did not disappoint. Especially, the first 30 minutes or so of ""Jojo Rabbit"" is chock full of children hurting themselves, engaging in hilarious ignorance driven misspeak, and a healthy dose of sardonic wit in which the young troop of pseudo cub scouts seem more like children being thrown into basic training and brainwashing. This section is so enjoyable, partially because of the child actors who are simply stellar throughout. The thrill of team activity and camaraderie is writ large across all of their faces even as their confusion about things 'too-grow-up' for them begin to encroach on their happy go lucky fun in the woods lifestyle.<br/><br/>This isn't all there is to life, though, as Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is soon to learn. Although he doesn't know it, his mother (Scarlett Johannson, ""Her"") is a member of the resistance and is hiding a Jewish girl in her attic. With Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie,""The King"") we get the introduction of an Anne Frank sort of character who forces Jojo into a bit of a quandary. On the one hand, he feels like he should turn her in but he also fears the 'devious ways of the Jew"" and suspects that turning her in may end up getting him and his mother in trouble. He decides instead to dedicate himself to learning and writing about the things he learns from her as a sort of study on Jews and why they are so awful.<br/><br/>As you can see, this film has some really interesting character complexities at play and I haven't even gotten to Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") as the Troop Leader for the kids or Jojo's little fat friend in the Hitler Youth who has some of the best lines of the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is where I have to say that I didn't love this film. For all of its great qualities which I described above, the film left me wanting. I don't think everyone will feel this way but there is no way around the fact that this film just didn't stick the landing for me. Why? I'm not exactly sure, and I'll own that.<br/><br/>I don't know why I didn't walk out of the theater shouting about about how much I adore this film. Maybe, the humorous and dramatic parts weren't balanced in the way that I typically like or certain sections weren't as snappy as I expected. Either way, I end up feeling that, while it is a good movie, it isn't one I expect to watch more than once more in my life, if that.<br/><br/>However, I do think that the film has an audience out there and I sincerely hope it finds that crowd. It is full of heart and the themes of seeking understanding about those different than us, the drive for acceptance, and confronting the ugly realities of life but not losing hope are surely important ones that anyone today will see the value of. Also, if you want to see a kid shoot a bazooka by accident and react as if he just spilled the milk instead of blowing up a building, then you may need to run out and see this film."
"joesiegel","8","3","3","18 February 2020"," The reason why the public is loving this movie is the same reason that the critics are hating it
","The critics were very hypersensitive and had a very closed mind when reviewing this movie.<br/><br/>JoJo Rabbit is a satirical vision of the Second World War, when dealing with an issue like this in a satirical way you have to be very careful not to seem so insensitive, Waititi uses the necessary touch of satira and social issues to create a kind of criticizes to the neo-nazist movements and the use of the naivety of children to take him to political issues, Waititi knew how to get there and does not explore the theme of nazism in a deep and somber way, however the movie gives a heartbraking scene whose protagonist is the feet of Scarlett Johansson, incredibly Waititi created an emotional scene involving feet better than Tarantino.<br/><br/>The film has a scene that involves the Nazi greeting that makes us laugh intelligently, that scene more than a criticism is a mockery, That no neo-nazi see this! Sincerely Waititi had never convinced me, however JoJo Rabbit is his best work Until now, Waititi cinema is full of satirical comedy and this film is its best and boldest demonstration, a sentimental story about the hate instilled in children irrationally, JoJo is a boy with little mind of his own and everything he knows It is practically things that his imaginary friend has put in his brain that turns out to be a child representation of Hitler, but it is obvious that this representation of Hitler is like that since it is the product of a child's mind and this reinforces more the naivety and JoJo's good heart."
"Naive-fox","8","5","6","26 February 2020"," Love in the time of holocaust
","Taika Waititi really is an odball. Some people hate him, some people love him, most don't even know what to think of him. For me, he's a director I always kept an eye on. His basic, silly humor was exactly my kind of thing, the canvas he painted it on... not so much. So when I heard he was working on a film revolving around the third Reich, it sounded like a great opportunity to finally put all that witful but weird humor to good use.<br/><br/>And it certainly was. 'Jojo Rabbit' is full of incredibly satisfying dark goofy moments. A satire they called it. Can't say it is. Taika tackles the nazi regime and the holocaust too lightly and the criticism isn't poignant enough to tag it as such. 'He falls short', said the critics, 'he is not bold enough'. Probably right. But the result of Taika's tameness is a wonderful comedy drama enjoyable by parents and children alike. Because a comedy it is and a comedy it remains, for the most part. But when the plot develops and the drama strikes, 'Jojo Rabbit' turns into the most heart-warming and at the same time heart-wrenching film of recent years.<br/><br/>Content aside little is there to say about Taika's last work, and all of it good. The directing is magisterial, with a perfect pace and visuals that make it hard to remember you're not watching one of Wes Anderson's masterpieces. And the cast shines so much on the screen as it did as a list of names on the title's credits. One after another, they all bring all their best into the table, regardless the importance of the role. That makes even more unbelievable the fact that a twelve year old newcomer could come and take advantage of playing the leading role to outshine a whole cast of acting titans. Roman Griffin Davis interacts with virtually every other character on the show, and his chemistry with every one of them is truly mesmerizing.<br/><br/>In a generally weak year for cinema there's no doubt that alongside Bong Joon Ho's 'Parasite' and Todd Phillips' 'Joker', 'Jojo Rabbit' is one of 2019's crown jewels. But while the sooner stands out for its beautiful cinematography and its almost flawless original script and the latter relies too much on Joaquin Phoenix's stellar performance, Taika's odd dark nazi comedy might be the most solid overall of the three."

One scene is intended to make you laugh. 30 seconds later there's a scene to make you cry. In the next scene it's back to comedy, and it goes on. As a result the emotional moments don't carry much weight. So you're left with an inbetween movie that isn't quite as funny as some of his other works (Hunt For The Wilderpeople) nor as emotional as similar movies like The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas.<br/><br/>I have to question Taika's intentions here.

","Taika Waititi delivers not only his best film to date but one of the finest films of 2019. It is everything you could want from a movie. Its funny, its sweet and has a lot of emotion plus its original and one of the best performed films of the year.
Roman Griffin Davis is really great here. He carrys this film. Everyone is exceptional here including Merchant, Johansson, McKenzie, Rockwell and Wilson (surprisingly). Taika Waititi is ace here. Delivering a rather genius and unique performance.
The whole style of the film is fresh and unique, thanks to Waititi being such an auteur and it's seriously well done. Waititi has a style which I adore. His direction and writing is seriously top notch quality here. And he manages to blend something serious with something funny yet at times really sad as well. It all pays off by the end. I had a blast with this film though. It's a 108 minute film without much fault. The third act really makes this film amazing.
Don't really have much wrong to say, sometimes the film doesn't always work with his style but that's few and far between and one scene didn't have the emotion, you would expect, other than that it is terrific. Definitely in the top 10 of 2019 so far."

There were some kids in the audience, asking mother, father, grandfather what happend at some point. So it was a schooling lesson for three generations. On the other hand, it was full of funny gags that showed how crappy the Third Reich was in everydays life. No German could have made this movie. It's good that Taika Waititi did. It was fun to watch.

The young boy gives one of the better child performances I have ever seen from a young actor. He is really great, and portrays the character in a complex way, and still has the young innocence you need from a child actor. The movie also deals with very touchy subjects incredibly well. You may think a movie poking fun at Nazi Germany may come off as offensive, or disrespectful, but I never felt that once while watching this film. I also felt the movie doing a wonderful job, at bringing the character together, and you understand why the characters in the film thought how they did.

"BA_Harrison","5","74","159","17 December 2019"," Hmmm.
","I'm usually quite decisive when it comes to rating films, but Jojo Rabbit has me in a bit of a quandry. I enjoyed the touching storyline of 10-year-old 'Hitler youth' Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) befriending Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl he finds hiding in his home. And I enjoyed the general irreverent tone and quirky satire. But I didn't laugh. Not once. And since I believe this is intended to be a comedy, I can't say that it is a complete success. A rating of 5 feels a little unfair, since the film is an undeniably unique and visually impressive experience, but at the same time it seems like a reasonable score for something that has left me feeling unsatisfied as a whole.<br/><br/>I definitely wish that Roman Griffin Davis and Archie Yates (who plays Jojo's friend Yorki) hadn't filmed an introduction for the preview I attended: it made it harder to accept them as their characters, which, to be honest, wasn't that easy in the first place because neither is particularly convincing. The adults are far better, with Stephen Merchant as a nasty Gestapo officer Deertz almost making me smile, and Sam Rockwell shining as Captain Klenzendorf, a disillusioned soldier who isn't as bad as he first seems. Director Taika Waititi mercilessly mocks Adolf Hitler, who appears to Jojo as an imaginary friend - he's fun (but not funny). Scarlett Johansson is extremely likeable as Jojo's loving mother, and even Rebel Wilson, who I normally can't stand, was bearable as cruel Nazi Fraulein Rahm.<br/><br/>5/10.

","First of all, I haven't read the book by Christine Laurens this movie is based on, but the teaser and trailer for the movie got me immediately hooked.
By the trailer, you can assume it is comedy, but it is far more than that, believe me. Today I had the opportunity to see the movie, and what a movie this is.<br/><br/>It starts as a comedy as seen in trailer, but after a few minutes into it, you realize that it is a serious war drama with comedy in the right places. In my opinion, there wasn't a movie which can balance comedy and tragedy this good, at least not in recent time I remember. For a movie with a dark theme, this one looks so colorful, but it seems that is the point since it is seen from the young boy perspective, and Taika Waititi's movies are full of bright colors.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect; Thomasin, Scarlett, Taika, Alfie, Rebel, Archie as Yorki, and my favorite Sam Rockwell as eccentric Captain Klenzendorfbut, hats off to young Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo - he really caries the movie. Usually, I really disliked Rebel Wilson's appearance in movies, not because of her alone and her acting (she's really good actually) but the type of the movies she was in are not my ""cup of tea"". But here, she fits absolutely perfect as crazed nazi woman, and she nailed it. From now on, you have my sympathies, young lady.<br/><br/>Taika is genius at his own at filmmaking, his movies are always full of great soundtrack and that style is what gets me more into the movie.
I must thank all of the crew behind this for beautiful movie experience, it is one of the years best, no doubt about it. So, obviously, this is a must watch!<br/><br/>And all of you who cheers for war and more hate, take a look at this one here among the others, and ask yourself - is the war what you really want?

","Let's cut right to the chase: Jojo Rabbit is every bit as original and effective a satire as Hogan's Heroes. It takes precisely the same approach to the Nazis, broadly caricaturing them as bumbling idiots and two-dimensional bullies. So it's no surprise that JoJo suffers from exactly the same problem as Hogan's Heroes: there's nothing real or threatening or genuinely sinister about these Nazis. They're just buffoons. Perhaps JoJo is marginally more daring in going so far as to depict Hitler himself, but Waititi's Fuhrer is as flimsy and fey as Mel Brook's take on him in Springtime For Hitler - only without the biting, derisive satire and the consistent hilarity. How funny you find JoJo Rabbit will likely depend on whether you also find The Three Stooges and Road Runner cartoons laugh-out-loud funny, for that's the level of most of what passes for humour here. If this is what passes for ""comedy genius"" and 10 out of 10 film-making in the 21st century, then heaven help us all."

A fair BAFTA and Oscar winner.<br/><br/>The film follows the main character Jojo, a Nazi-party-loving 10-year old. Through him, we see the power of education and context in creating hate and admiration for a leader. The fact that same leader, Hitler, is Jojo's trusted imaginary friend is genius.

Even the ""sweet' and ""charming"" moments were hit-or-miss for me.<br/><br/>After the first hour, I can say that I found myself touched and moved out of the blue. I figured out that the film dramatically is quite effective. And if that says anything, it's that the dramatic set-up is actually great but Waititi's insistence to convince us, in a most factitious and pretentious way, that his film possess the punch, which it claims to be having, utterly blinded me of its emotional heft, which it definitely there, and it did take me off guard.<br/><br/>What's more off-putting than the cringe-worthy, infantile humour and the lame attempts at satire is that it tries to conceal its toothless satire behind the fact it's told from the perspective of a 10-year-old boy, which is true but inadequate and even kinda irrelevant, and the fact Waititi tried so hard to make it work satirically is the ultimate proof.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from jarring tonal shifts, but I think this is a relatively minor issue. Maybe it's too generous of me to give this film such rating, but I can't deny how emotionally impactful it ended up being. Also, Thomasin McKenzie. WOW!<br/><br/>(6.5/10)"

Ordinarily this is fine but for those who are inevitably gullible enough to take this satire as an accurate account of Nazi Germany I think it is potentially dangerous for it to play at devils advocate.<br/><br/>The tonal mish-mash between comedic and tragic seems, I think misguided and isn't particularly funny given the subject matter. There was the odd bit of amusement but generally the story was quite dull, meandering unless your perspective is clouded by an idealisation of children's 'ways of knowing', to paraphrase the postmodern mindset."
"bastille-852-731547","5","134","330","23 October 2019"," Uneven, messy ""anti-hate satire""
","I was hoping that this film could be profound and entertaining since I love satire, and it has a strong cast. Unfortunately, its humor and ambition never reach the potential they could possibly strive to obtain. The film is set during World War II in Nazi Germany, and tells the story of a young Hitler Youth member whose imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler. The boy is blindly following the despicable scourge of Nazism, but is forced to confront his beliefs when he discovers that a Jewish girl is hiding in his home.<br/><br/>While the story could have engaged in very clever and acerbic satire showing the true depravity of fascism, the film's attempts to skewer the Nazi ideology never really rises above the pedestrian. The film's jokes are surprisingly often thin and juvenile rather than truly witty and thought-provoking, and they manage to wear thin quickly. Another problem with this film is that its purpose--a supposedly edgy satire against the Nazi regime--is somewhat self-defeating when the film is never quite as edgy or provocative as it could be, opting to often play it safe by simply resorting to baseline and surface-level writing. While the characters are engaging enough, they are never developed enough to truly care about their motivations or what happens to them. The film also contains a bizarre tonal change that is executed very poorly, unlike the brilliant manipulation of tone in something like Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite."" It looks interesting aesthetically, with engaging cinematography and unique production design reminiscent of Wes Anderson, and it has some clever moments in its first act. Unfortunately, though, there isn't a ton else especially memorable on display here. 5/10"

","This is why I rarely watch mainstream movies today: it's because they are cartoonish versions of more serious movies. Like this movie, ""Jojo"", which portrays Berlin at the end of ww2 as a dreamy, romantic place - let me break it to you: it was not. Berlin at the end of ww2 was all in rubble, you couldn't find stone standing on another stone, and people were starving. There weren't any postcard-like streets where you can dance and dream.<br/><br/>So you really have to wonder why don't people rather watch Rossellini's 1948 movie ""Germany Year Zero"" which is also about a boy in Berlin, although immediately after the war, facing grim reality of destroyed Berlin and whole German nation? And the answer is that that movie is too grim for today's audience, they need watered down and cartoony version of that movie - and that is very disturbing."

","This movie is toothless in every way, the only joke it has is Hitler spewing anachronistic slang and having its actors do bad German accents. This movie completely reduces the Holocaust into ""Germans just didn't know their Jewish compatriots well enough, and if they had, they would have seen them as just people."" That's bunks of course, Jews were ingrained into the fabric of society in Germany, people turned on their neighbors and friends, and it wasn't out of lack of exposure, but rather blind hate. Taika Waititi has deflected critiques of the film by saying he's Jewish, which is not true (his mom is half Jewish on her paternal side) and I have seen very little mention of this, and I think it needs to be brought up, being that this film would be tasteless even if it's director was entirely Jewish. This isn't gatekeeping, just reality, people should tell their own narratives or be exceptionally careful when telling others, because when they step out of their lanes, you can get problematic stuff like this, where massive human tragedies are reduced into Wes-Andersonesque twee drivel and Nazis are portrayed as essentially good people.
The humor is nonexistent, every joke is tired and can be broken up into two categories: 1) the ""we're still doing this?"" joke where the humor is just because a bit is protracted beyond how long it is expected to be. 2) anachronistic slang and winking at the audience about information what we're privy to. That's it, and not a single thing evokes a single laugh. It is shockingly unfunny."

"CineMuseFilms","2","45","102","28 December 2019"," Original in conception but a misfire in execution.
","Given the polarisation of opinion about Jojo Rabbit (2019), it would be so much easier not to write this review at all. However, it is incumbent on me to explain why this movie is one of the worst I have seen in years.<br/><br/>The trailer captures the narrative essence of this war comedy drama. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year old German boy who aspires to be a Nazi killing-machine but his Hitler Youth camp squad nickname him Rabbit because he runs away when ordered to kill one. When he finds Jewish teenager Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) sheltered in the attic he has the chance to betray her in service of the Fuhrer, but his conscience comes into play.<br/><br/>This narrative arc is grounded in a predictable coming of age tale. A magical fantasy device frames the story wherein Jojo has an imaginary friend that only he can see, a campy goofball version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) who urges him to betray Elsa. With the Allied armies closing in, the German war effort enters its dying days and Jojo must confront Nazi lies.<br/><br/>Whether one thinks this film is a comedy or travesty is entirely subjective. Many will laugh at a puerile script delivered in gratingly mangled German accents with incongruous contemporary phrasing. Others may enjoy non-stop dead-pan exchanges, such as Elsa asking ""what am I?"", with Jojo answering ""a Jew"", to which Elsa replies ""Gesundheit"". Or when a female commandant (Rebel Wilson) tells Nazi girls it's a privilege to serve German soldiers: she has borne eighteen children already so ""it's a great time to be a girl"". Some will even think Jojo's cartoonish Hitler is a credibly funny representation of evil, perhaps unaware of the all-time satirical classic: the goose-stepping John Cleese and his ""don't mention the war"" skit. Where Cleese had surgical control of his mockery, Jojo's Hitler sprays cheap one-liners that are cringingly unfunny.<br/><br/>It is argued that half of today's generation know very little about Hitler, Nazism, and the Holocaust, so films like this potentially alert us to the dangers of extreme politics. Jojo Rabbit may have worked had it opted for clarity or gravity of purpose; its stellar cast make little difference. It is a mashup of so many genres that any meaningful message is lost, and all is sacrificed to low brow gags. Even the film's most serious moments struggle for respect under the shadow of slapstick, kitsch, and the vain attempt to use stand-up comedy to portray humanity's darkest time. With a climax that mocked my staying power, this film is, at best, original in conception but a misfire in execution."

","In the latter days of the Third Reich with growing disillusionment setting in due to the pending outcome of WWII, a jingoistic ten-year-old boy reaches a milestone in his life as he prepares to join his first Hitler Youth training camp. Though certain of his loyalty, he makes a shocking discovery that calls his entire belief system into question. Film's content is risky, but director Waititi (also appearing onscreen as a tongue-in-cheek caricature of The F√ºhrer himself) treads carefully to inject subversive humor that preaches against the same hateful vitriol that the regime inspired. Initially witty, outlandish, and irreverent, but loses a lot of steam after a strong start, and despite some dramatic turns in the third act it lacks a really strong, convincing conclusion to wrap things up. Well-acted, with incredible work from Davis in the central role, quality support from Johansson as his conflicted but fiercely protective mother, and an unselfconscious Rockwell as a bumbling camp commandant, but the parts are greater than the whole in this bold attempt to satirize Nazi Germany. **¬Ω"

"gortx","Null","13","26","1 November 2019"," A Boy and his Fake Fuhrer
","Films have parodied the Nazis even while WWII raged, including everyone from Chaplin to The Three Stooges to Mel Brooks. Enter Taiki Waititi seemingly channeling Wes Anderson in JOJO RABBIT. Waititi turns up the trademark Anderson Twee barometer to 11 right from the outset. A ten year old Hitler Youth to be named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) has an imaginary friend. And, he's not just your typical fanciful pal, but Hitler himself (Waititi). The Fake Fuhrer has a goofy grin and prances about like a reject from a Dresden burlesque show. The effect is like an even sillier Hogan's Heroes for a while.
Fortunately, things settle down once a teenage Jewish girl in hiding is introduced - Elsa, played by the terrific young actress Thomasin McKenzie (LEAVE NO TRACE). Elsa becomes the heart and soul of the movie and keeps it grounded. Jojo's mom (Scarlett Johansson) also brings some gravitas to the story despite also being a bit of a caricature at the outset. Jojo and Elsa strike up a guarded friendship of sorts despite being on 'opposite' sides - and, of course, the constant pestering of Fake Fuhrer (not to mention the intrusions of the Gestapo represented here by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) and Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson). Rockwell and Wilson are out-sized cartoon villains who also seemingly have studied every frame of Wes Anderson's guide to broad acting. Archie Yates is genuinely affecting as Jojo's hapless friend Yorki.
JOJO RABBIT, despite far too many arch attempts at humor, eventually does get it points across. The music choices (often intentionally anachronistic) usually work (particularly for the touching coda), and Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s cinematography has some exceptional compositions. The Elsa/Jojo relationship garners some genuine moments of pathos and warmth (something Anderson rarely achieves). Waititi obviously means well, but, he is is own worst enemy as he himself turns in the most grating performance of all as Fake Fuhrer and wrote the screenplay (based on a novel). Every time McKenzie and Davis do their best to elevate the uneven storyline, Fake Fuhrer interrupts the flow and the mood. It is no exaggeration to say that the movie would be vastly improved with excision of the character entirely. At the very least, Waititi fails to give the gimmick a real reason to be. The irony is too mild, the arc so narrow that the character becomes virtually meaningless.
JOJO RABBIT is affecting on a certain level, but for a movie that bills itself as ""An Anti-Hate Satire"" it's pretty weak tea. Making a movie with Hitler as a sidekick will offend some just on it's face, so you may as well bring something much more cutting to justify it, but Waititi is more content with playing nice. For a parable about a youth in Germany during this period with teeth, seek out Volker Schl√É¬∂ndorff's masterful THE TIN DRUM (based on Gunter Grass' novel). JOJO is more akin to Roberto Bengini's benign if also affecting LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL."
"gekkepoppetje","1","68","176","29 December 2019"," Bad joke
","Humor can be an excellent way to escape from terrible things. Humor is also a legitimate way of escaping terrible things. Yet there are terrible things you don't have to joke about. For example, it would be completely unnecessary to make jokes about how people die in gas chambers. The makers of Jojo Rabbit not only present jokes about, for example, children who blow themselves up: they are also bad jokes and that is unforgivable. Jojo Rabbit becomes painful in 2 ways: because painful facts are raised and because bad jokes are made about it. The drama in the film does not work either. If I am presented with funny Nazis in one scene, how can I believe a scene later that they hang people? The presence of Scarlett Johansson is a complete mystery to me. If I were her I would take another agent. The production probably had too much budget."

","I would've liked to see Hitler played completely straight instead of caricature and that would have been funnier and more intriguing. To play up our cognitive dissonance by him being stern, fatherly, helpful, his death by suicide would tear apart the boy's ideology and father figure leading to the post-film identity crisis, more resonant to the nation in reckoning. The film could have messed with its frame, towing the line of its satire politically to find a richer indictment of humanity underneath. Rather, its offensiveness is it seems to deny the boy his Nazidom, so ends up accidentally committing the worst of what it works so tirelessly to avoid, is trivializing the humanity at center. ""You don't believe in anything, you want to be part of something."" Too easy. The film shies from delving into the nation swept away in this movement. It denies their choice! So what exactly is it sending up? Hate, in the most arbitrary sense? No. It's why it desperately cycles through every shorthand of the genre to take the form of its acclaim, when its only intent is to rhyme with today, then obfuscates the parallels ignoring how the economics shorthanded into social scapegoating. I think taking a deeper stance beyond caricature would have been extremely provocative, and untenable in today's climate. Someone comically said, ""They don't make films like this anymore""... But no, everything is like this. Here is a satire without any satire at all. Its tagline is, 'an anti-hate satire' is like the new Star Wars going on about 'the empire' without really elaborating on any sort of motive. Empire is enough. Everything operates in shorthand as a means to 'other' the dissidents. Is it intentional? Or a natural symptom or escalation of the NPC age? I just see cowardice: they believe delving into societal, cultural, economic context would invite it to be considered, so we are asked instead to shorthand it all as blind hate and trust them that none of the Nazi's really believed it and it's just a flaw in the code how dumb people take to ideologies like fads, guilty only of being manipulated. Then the film being plainly about Trumpism cheapens both the past and present. Look how the girl in the closet's arc only seems to be that she's not a ghost or vampire; it's not that she's human but that she's not not human. This is the true terror beneath this, that the very mechanism of prevention through othering, inherently leads to the continuation of the cycle."
"nearlymellow","1","29","69","7 February 2020"," Peculiar
","About 3 minutes into this film I just knew I wouldn't like it. It might be some people's thing but the comedy is just so juvenile. Yea, it's a 12 and marketed around a young boy and his imaginary friend Hitler, so what do you expect? But really it felt like that typical American Will Ferrell/Adam Sandler slapshtick. Hitler was probably the funniest part of this film just for the stupidity of it, but is fat man in funny moustache an original idea? No. I'm sure there's a million and one better portrayals of this idea somewhere in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Also, and this was the deal-breaker for me, is the weird directing decision to make the narrative of this story so skittish and nonsensical. All throughout, the story just doesn't feel continuous & always lacking in context, and then about half-way through it becomes largely one-room based. It just didn't feel like a film, but more like a vaguely connected series of skits with mild attempts at bittersweetness in it.<br/><br/>These attempts at bittersweetness didn't really work for me either. There are bits in the film where it's nice to see the delusion of German people at the time, the hopelessness of it, the comedy disguising the horrors going on around them, but it's so understated and surrounded by dry attempts at comedy that it becomes hard to take seriously. The tone's all wrong.<br/><br/>The acting's alright, but for some reason they make everyone have German accents. Maybe for comedy, but they never make a joke around German mispronunciations or anything like that, so I was just distracted by how bad the accents were most of the time. Everyone just sounded Russian or braindead.<br/><br/>If you wanna watch this film with your kid, it might be alright. There's some sensitive ideas expressed but they probably won't notice as they'll be too busy laughing at Hitler (fantastic). Just don't be fooled by the good reviews as I don't think they're reflecting the actual QUALITY of the film, but more just it's 'humour'"

The actual history of child use in Nazi Germany is a horror, inhuman, beyond what people think anyone could be capeble of, a real insight into the terror humans can achieve and it really happened... Hitler Youth was not some sort of American Eagle Scout camp where it's members lived in happy 21st century, middle-class, political correct kinds of homes. In its attempt Jojo Rabbit actually sanitizes the worse of truth and while I came in wanting to like it because I'm a sucker for satire and comedies, I ended up wondering what the hell is wrong with Hollywood's liberal culture? patronizing, boiled down, censored, cowardly, self-confused, sluggish, uninformed... I know that not all movies should be Tarkovsky but watch Ivan's Childhood, Rossellini's Germany Year Zero, Elem Kilmov's Come and See ... if you have a thesis don't take it half way, go the entire distance and don't pretend the film is something it's not... this is not even close to Strangelove, To Be or Not to Be, The Great Dictator, Stalag 17."

","Courageous people can certainly find humor and irony in the most desperate situations. The lighthearted treatment of the hate and bigotry that led to the death of millions is not one of these. The attempt to do so in this movie is strained from the start, moves quickly to confusing, then embarrassing, then simply offensive. What's really frightening is the level of distortion and misinformation that serves as a backdrop for the more obvious schtick. Was there an attempt at an underlying message, sure. But it was lost in the trivialization of the Holocaust and catastrophe that was Naziism. As a paying member of the public, I felt not just bamboozled, but victimized, by this movie."

","There has been a fair amount of buzz about this film for a while, i hadn't read any reviews so thought i'd check it out. I loved What We Do in the Shadows so what could go wrong? Well plenty really as illustrated here. Not very funny, not funny enough a satire that's for sure. I think it felt a little like the 10 1/2 yr old boy in the film wrote it himself. If youre going to turn Nazi's into a joke try make it a funny one. The story is just far too whimpering, not daring enough. Plenty of people on here are celebrating it and saying the critics got it wrong but i agree with the critics, its a bucket of drivel really. Such cheap tricks, young children meant to stare up our emotions, naive humour, no it doesn't work and sorry but the little boys acting is a bit cardboard, it feels like the director coached his comic lines and took the natural delivery away. Almost desperate to be a bit Wes Anderson which is equally as boring. I admit to enjoying a few moments but hell some tv adverts are slightly amusing, i still don't care for them though. I give it 5.5 stars out of 10. (Not quite bad enough for a 5 but a 6 makes is misleading)"
"grantpaulsen","7","20","46","20 October 2019"," It Was Good
","Jojo Rabbit was a very enjoyable and funny satire. I liked the acting especially from Taika Watiti, and the child actors did a surprisingly good job. I liked the directing and cinematography even though it was nothing exceptional. I thought the writing, dialogue, and script was good overall but again nothing exceptional. I liked the story, themes, and ideas explored in this film, but there were some aspects that didn't work for me. One of the biggest problem was the tone. For almost the entire film the tone is comedic but then sometime in the middle it just switches to completely serious out of nowhere and then just goes back to being comedic. Which causes the film to feel a bit jarring. There's also some emotional beats in the film that didn't work for me, since the film was comedic all the way up until that point I wasn't able to feel any of the emotions the film wanted me to feel. Not to mention the story and characters weren't developed enough to make these parts work which caused these moments to feel unearned and underdeveloped. But I still enjoyed it overall. I don't feel much of a desire to see it again and I don't understand why there's a lot of buzz surrounding this film. I would recommend this film despite some criticisms."

","First Hit: A fantastic black comedy that digs deep at the idiocy of the Nazi movement.<br/><br/>Good black comedies are difficult to come by. In recent years ""The Death of Stalin"" was one such film. As I wrote the previous sentence, I realized that both films are about corrupt leaders of countries. However, I digress.<br/><br/>In this film, Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is a lonely young boy who idolizes Adolf Hitler and his movement. He lives with his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), while his dad is supposedly off fighting for the Germans in Italy.<br/><br/>To support his belief in the Nazi movement, he's created an imaginary Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) who visits him in his make-believe world. His version of Hitler is off the charts hilarious. Hitler struts around making outlandish statements and sings young Jojo's praises for admiring Hitler and what he stands for.<br/><br/>Jojo and Rosie live in a small German town. All the young boys, like him, are signed up to be part of Hitler's youth corps. His only friend Yorki (Archie Yates), is a slightly rotund young boy with glasses, and together they are heading off to a Hitler youth camp experience.<br/><br/>The boys and girls all gathered together at the camp are dressed up in their Nazi uniforms. They are led through hilarious drills by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), a drunken Nazi Youth Camp Leader, and his counterpart, Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), for the young girls.<br/><br/>One day while in his home alone, he hears noises upstairs and discovers a young woman Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie) living in a secret compartment in the walls of a room upstairs. Elsa is Jewish and is being hidden there by Rosie. Why is his mother hiding a Jew in her home? Then we learn that maybe Elsa may also be a stand-in, of sorts, for his dead sister.<br/><br/>Although Jojo is supposed to dislike and want to kill Jews like Elsa, he discovers that she's not a bad person and that he's falling for her in his own 11-year-old boy way.<br/><br/>Discussing all this with his imaginary Hitler is hilarious at times. The absurd statements and thoughts about what Jojo should or should not do about his captive Jew make pointed jabs at Hitler's insane ideology.<br/><br/>As the film moves along, we sense the end of the war is near, and the German Army is starting to lose the battle against the Russians, Europeans, and US forces. They are closing in which makes Jojo's Hitler even funnier.<br/><br/>The film is quick-paced and moves rapidly from scene to scene. The quick-paced moments are exemplified when the boys at camp and when the war comes to their little town. However, this film knows when to linger. Scenes like when Jojo and Rosie are walking along the river, or when Jojo and Elsa are writing his book about Jews. The film is also deeply touching as shown when Jojo and Yorkie are shown hugging each other several times throughout the film. It was even moving when Captain Klenzendorf saves Jojo from being imprisoned by the allies. Later, when Jojo dances with Elsa, recalling an earlier time when Jojo danced with Rosie. In these moments the film glows.
I thought the sets and costumes were fantastic and really captured the heart of the film.<br/><br/>Davis was extraordinary as Jojo. He carried this story with a wide range of feelings, emotions, and actions. Waititi is superb as the innovative imagination of Jojo's Adolf Hitler. He uses sarcasm, expressive physical movement, and whit to define and make this character come alive. McKenzie was sublime as Elsa. Her strength and compassion while attempting to stay alive in a country that reviled her kind was, at times, riveting. Johansson was excellent as Jojo's mother. She embodied someone straddling the line of life and death along with survival and what's right wonderfully. Rockwell was over-the-top perfect for this role. When he carefully validated Elsa's papers, you knew of his heart. Wilson was well cast as Fraulein Rahm, a woman who got away with saying outlandish things. Waititi also wrote and directed this film, and it was clear he knew what he wanted, and he got it, a fun-filled touching black comedy.<br/><br/>Overall: This was an excellent film that also reflected the struggles of the current day."

üèÜTIFF People's Choice Award Winner<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit (Taika Waititi) is brilliantly funny, securing it the Grolsch People's Choice Award, an obvious choice based on audience reaction during the screenings. There were more scenes of audible laughter than in any other film we saw. Our last film of the festival, we were watching this film as it was being awarded the landmark award of the festival; a consummate way to close off the festival!<br/><br/>Set in Germany during the Second World War, Jojo Rabbit is vastly different than the films we think of from this setting. Some will argue that it makes light of the horrors of the time. It is frivolous in its interpretation of the superhero status of Hitler (portrayed as the young character's imaginary friend Adolf) as well as the horrid descriptions of Jews. Some viewers may find this unsettling.<br/><br/>While it is certainly much lighter than we would expect from a film on Nazi Germany, there are lessons of acceptance under the humour. From a child's perspective, we can see the effects of propaganda and brainwashing by the state, and the power of personal relationships in changing that narrative. With witty pacing and a dynamic cast, the characters become larger-than-life, but balance with each other in the point of view of a young boy.<br/><br/>While this film will be one of the more controversial of the year, it is undoubtedly funny, and is sure to be a crowd pleaser. You are sure to laugh your way through the film and discuss it long after."

"rogierhetem","10","9","18","5 January 2020"," Emotional rollercoaster to the last minute
","A tragic (dark) comedy, with un underlying positive message.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in a very humorous but slightly silly fashion. The beginning jokes made me experience a feeling of unease. After the main character Johannes practises his German greeting with Adolf himself, I quickly realized that Johannes isn't only adorable but also portraits a completly believable human being. He just lives in a bizarre world. As the movie progresses the story becomes deeper and the complexity of the war unfolds itself. As Johannes finds the hidden girl living in their attic, his own truth about the world slowly starts to crumble. In the private conversations these two kids have, I saw the brilliance of both young actors. They managed to take my breath more than once. Both with laughs and with tears. Any kind of 'cheap' feeling I might have had during the first ten minutes now faded. I am completely captured by the story. The many laughable moments are perfectly balanced with the overall tragedy. In the for me most memorable scene Rosie, Johannes mother, dances her sons anger and pain away as they talk about his father who left home. In this scene Scarlett Johansson demonstrates a variety of acting skills which made me admire her even more. Altough my sadness grew as the movie came closer to its ending. The strength and positive attitude of pretty much all main characters can't stop me from feeling good. It is a movie worth debating. But mostly felt like a little piece of art."

The relevance of the humour was excellent, and this complemented the serious messages of acceptance and looking for belonging, brilliantly. The naivety of JoJo was very well portrayed and important messages could be taken regarding acceptance of others and the dangers of propaganda and misinformation.

Credit to all actors in this film also, especially the children actors."
"carlos37andre","7","6","11","5 February 2020"," Good, but it could have been more
","I had a really bad experience watching this movie in the theater, not related to the movie itself, just that the power went off three times in the screening room, and it delayed the whole thing almost 40 minutes. Still, I'm trying by best to not consider that on my thoughts about the movie, I'm truly trying to be impartial, but I get that maybe my overall feel of the movie might have been influenced by the experience I had watching it. So, just wanna to put that disclaimer out there.<br/><br/>Starting with the good stuff, the acting in the movie is great, Roman Griffin Davis is really really good in the movie, as is his friend in the movie Archie Yates, this movie is for both young actors their first credit hole in anything according to IMDb, so, this is a hell of a start for both of them. Taika is also fantastic in it, even though he doesn't have as many scenes I thought he had in the movie. Scarlett Johansson is also good here, even though I don't quite get the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I love the cinematography, is a beautifully shot film, and it kind of has an ""Wes Andersonish"" style to it.<br/><br/>Besides those aspects tho, the best aspect of the movie is the comedy, the movie is so much funny in multiple times. Even though most of the time, the movie is dealing with some truly f-up stuff it gets away with a bunch of stuff by passing by it with a joke and getting a life out of you, even though you shouldn't laugh at it.<br/><br/>This satire aspect of it all is especially funny at first, but it short of loses it a bit when the movie goes on. I felt like it got coming back to most of the ""themes"" to joke about that it had already joked about.<br/><br/>And at the end, I felt like it didn't balance the comedy/satire aspect with the dramatic part of it. Things happen, like Jojo's mother death, that could potentially be a huge turning point, and focal point going towards the end, but it doesn't really impact his life that much. Even though the scene where he discovers her death is gorgeously executed, without even showing her face, the death itself doesn't impact as much as it should in Jojo's overall story.<br/><br/>And I know that most of it is supposed to be an over the top satire, that shows how bad Nazism was, and how screwed people were at the end of it all because of it. And that's fine, however, the movie isn't all an over the top satire, it has its ""down to earth"" moments, and because of those moments, when something that would truly impact the life of our 10 years old protagonist happens (namely his mother passing away), you kind expects that it will be approached in a certain way, and it isn't.<br/><br/>So the ending itself, even though it's beautiful with the ""dance"" callback, feels like of empty, like if they could have done more, and evolve Jojo's character a bit more. Again, I love the satire part of it, and how it does a critic of something as bad as Nazism, by making you laugh at it, but I felt like something was missing at the end, and they could have gone further with the story.<br/><br/>To sum up, Jojo Rabbit is a good movie, that deals with a really serious subject with a light and funny approach, it's clearly meant to be an over the top satire, but at the end, I felt like it could have gone further in exploring something that were settled up before, and developing its protagonist even more."

It's not for everyone, yet he manages to make you experience actual deep emotions towards the characters and get the best out of actors. I saw many movies with Scarlet Johanson, but it was the first time ever, that I felt real appreciation towards her as an actress. She got the Oscar nod for the best supporting actress, but after seeing this one, in my opinion, she should have won. Young actors are very young, but they gave an excellent performances. It was a real shock moment once you see some of the sadder parts of the movie. Presentation is everything and this one is a rare movie that makes you sad and happy simultaneously, and that's where Waititi's talent shines. It's not an epic 10/10 blockbuster of an Avengers endgame proportions, but it's unexpected and brilliant. It's rare for me to re-watch those types of movies, yet I would like to return to that same universe and I definitely would like to see the follow up of the story if he ever decides to shoot it."

"canadude","3","5","9","7 February 2020"," Pretending to be about something it fails to grasp
","I like Taika Waititi's films, but this is an infantilzation of the holocaust on par with (trigger warning) Life is Beautiful. Like this other film, Jojo Rabbit turns the antisemitism and nazi fanaticism into a light Hollywood fairy tale with enough carefully manicured dark moments to imply that it has something deeper going on, when it really doesn't. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the story is tonally all over the place (missing is the effortless tension of comedy and tragedy present in Hunt for the Wilderpeople), and there are no insights here (we know nazis are bad, antisemitism is irrational). Jojo's transformation as presented here is facile and unbelievable, and the deliberate caricatures are too far removed from their real, historical counterparts to have any sting of the best of mercilessly dark satire.<br/><br/>The movie could have mined the abject absurdity of nazi ideology for humor (The Great Dictator being a classic example along with The Producers), but it's jokes are easy and soft on the audience. They don't match the subject matter and the tension between their cuteness and the movie's darker aspirations never produces anything worthwhile - it doesn't really work for the most part. This is ultimately a kids movie, a stylized fairy tale, and though no one watches this expecting Come and See (1985), its sugary tone is overwhelming and is undone by its more serious pretensions. The movie ultimately cannot communicate, let alone grasp, the weight of the tragedy it chooses as its subject matter, which makes its humor empty rather than resonant."
"davjanes","3","12","28","24 December 2019"," A Dearth of Jokes
","Considering it's meant to be a comedy, Jojo Rabbit lacks enough jokes to sustain the entertainment for nearly two hours. Perhaps that's just a sign of these dreary repressive age we are living in, where jokes are considered so potentially offensive, that writers fear to employ them. They did invoke irony though, for example the film opens with a Beatles song then later there is a scene reminiscent of one of those Beatles bonfires they would hold twenty years later in the Great Satan. And then Adolf didn't have strikingly blue eyes, whereas Elsa did. This was about as amusing as SNL, but unlike SNL it was ""so white"". I didn't notice any GIs of color or oriental Soviets and who is mandating stormtroopers and Gestapo officers have to be played by white men? If you really want to watch humorous drama with an Aotearoan touch, you'd be better off watching the Brokenwood Mysteries."

It's just bizarre how they portrayed Hitler as some goofy hip dude from the 60's man(he literally uses the word man a lot). I thought with Fat Amy in the movie it would have some funny scenes with her but her lines were just dull and flat. And it didn't help that JS was just a goofy and air-headed mom dancing around. At the beginning of the movie she was a powerful Nazi leader then after that they just kind of forgot about that fact and then she was just a goofy mom that liked to ride bikes. What?

","How this movie got a nomination for Best Picture baffles me. It's not terrible. There's certainly some imagination to it. But it goes nowhere - except to the obvious ending. Ideas introduced early in the picture, like Jojo being told by his invisible friend to develop the characteristics of the rabbit, never get developed. Sometimes there is comedy of anachronism when we hear modern pop music, like the Beatles, while watching a scene from World War II, but that too goes nowhere. Yes, there's certainly a change in Jojo's views on Hitler and anti-semitism, but they come for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>I found myself wishing it would end long before it did.<br/><br/>According to an article I read before writing this, the director/script writer added a great deal of his own material, including the imaginary friend, to this movie, and cut out most of the second half of the novel on which he based it. I don't expect feature movies to reproduce exactly the works on which they are based, but the radical changes made here from the source may explain why this movie doesn't hold together very well.<br/><br/>Catch this at home on streaming or dvd.

","While not as agonisingly heart breaking as Life is Beautiful, I think Jojo Rabbit runs a stronger line of black comedy, that at any moment in my theatre had half the audience laughing, and the other half holding their breath.
All the performances were excellent, and I think this was Taika Waititi's best. While he mostly played the character of 10 year old Jojo's imaginary best friend (Hitler) for laughs, there were moments when he would channel the nascent violence from the real Fuhrer's newsreel speeches that were truly frightening.
Sam Rockwell plays it perfectly as always, in what I think was a nuanced portrayal of a man who could see the end coming.
I am a fan of Scarlett Johansson. She delivers here.

"Bertaut","9","9","21","18 January 2020"," A hilarious piece of political satire that isn't afraid to be serious
","We live in dangerous times. In this era of political regression, racists, xenophobes, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, white separatists, and fascists, once confined to the periphery of civilised society, have wormed their way back into the cultural mainstream, preaching hate and intolerance under the guise of terms such as ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"". Meanwhile, politicians validate such groups by doing precisely nothing to curtail them and refusing to condemn them (""very fine people on both sides"" and so forth). Scholars and sociocultural anthropologists have posited that hateful right-wing ideologies are more validated now than at any time since the rise of fascism, the best known example of which is, of course, the Third Reich.<br/><br/>And so, it's entirely fitting that a film set in this very milieu, which argues that love, tolerance, and kindness can defeat hateful indoctrination, has come along at this precise moment. Based loosely on the 2004 novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens, Jojo Rabbit is a political satire written and directed by <a href=""/name/nm0169806/"">Taika Waititi</a>. Positing that the first casualty of indoctrination is objective truth, Waititi follows in the footsteps of filmmakers such as <a href=""/name/nm0000122/"">Charles Chaplin</a> (<a href=""/title/tt0032553/"">The Great Dictator (1940)</a>), <a href=""/name/nm0000316/"">Mel Brooks</a> (<a href=""/title/tt0063462/"">The Producers (1967)</a>), <a href=""/name/nm0000905/"">Roberto Benigni</a> (<a href=""/title/tt0118799/"">La vita √® bella (1997)</a>), and even <a href=""/name/nm0000233/"">Quentin Tarantino</a> (<a href=""/title/tt0361748/"">Inglourious Basterds (2009)</a>) in attempting to defang Nazi ideology by rendering it utterly absurd. Marketed as an ""anti-hate satire"", the film has no easy task - to use Nazism as the (mostly) humorous background to what is essentially a bildungsroman, without it seeming exploitative or dismissive. And Waititi manages this tricky balancing act exceptionally well. The satire and slapstick elements are as funny as anything in his filmography, and the film's more serious moments (of which there are several) arrive like an absolute gut-punch. Jojo Rabbit is, in fact, that rarest of films - a comedy where the serious moments feel completely earned and a drama where the comedy enhances the seriousness.<br/><br/>Gro√üdeutsches Reich, 1945. In the fictional town of Falkenhem, ten-year-old Jojo Betzler (an astonishing debut by <a href=""/name/nm9877392/"">Roman Griffin Davis</a>) lives with his whimsical mother Rosie (<a href=""/name/nm0424060/"">Scarlett Johansson</a> doing probably the best work of her career) and his imaginary best friend - none other than Hitler himself (a ludicrously over the top Waititi). Believing absolutely in his duty to the state, Jojo and his actual flesh-and-blood friend Yorki (a hilarious <a href=""/name/nm9987228/"">Archie Yates</a>) attend a Hitlerjugend camp run by the cynical Cpt. Klenzendorf (a powerful performance by <a href=""/name/nm0005377/"">Sam Rockwell</a> that was outrageously ignored by the Academy), who was forced to leave the front line upon losing an eye. However, after an accident with a grenade, Joho is sent home. As he recovers, Rosie persuades Klenzendorf, who was demoted after the incident, to give him some work, and so he's employed to distribute propaganda around town. Life is dull but straightforward. That is until he learns his mother has been hiding a young Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (a nuanced performance from <a href=""/name/nm5057169/"">Thomasin McKenzie</a>), in a crawlspace in their house.<br/><br/>Perhaps Jojo Rabbit's most laudable component is how well Waititi balances the disparate tones, which is a hell of a lot better than Benigni did. The film mixes slapstick humour, caricature, satire, dramatic irony, and hope, but never does it seem like its ignoring or trivialising real suffering. When the comedy is dropped and Waititi gets serious, the tonal shifts pack a shocking punch, and it's because they're so well integrated into the overarching comic structure - if you take away the humour and the satirical edge, the film's darker elements simply don't work as well - it's the contrast that makes each element all the more powerful. Waititi's tonal intentions are indicated right from the beginning, as stock footage of German children performing 'Heil Hitlers' is scored (unashamedly anachronistically) by the German version of <a href=""/name/nm1397313/"">The Beatles</a>' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" (1963). Also crucially important to the film's tonal qualities are the bright, colourful palette employed by director of photography <a href=""/name/nm1893246/"">Mihai Malaimare Jr.</a> and the whimsical Oscar-nominated production design by Waititi's regular designer, <a href=""/name/nm1308151/"">Ra Vincent</a>. Together, they speak to the fact that this is Jojo's worldview rather than objective reality, with the look of the film reminding me a great deal of <a href=""/title/tt2278388/"">The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)</a>. It sure doesn't look like any World War II movie you're ever likely to have seen.<br/><br/>Thematically, the film examines multiple issues; the devotion of motherhood, the importance of kindness in defeating indoctrination, the disconnect between an unchallenged ideology and a complex reality, the predetermined attitudinal stance towards the Other, the clash between doing what one knows to be right and what one is expected to do, the fact that good people can be found even in the worst of circumstances. Klenzendorf's arc is especially telling in this respect. Introduced as a hyperbolic caricature, the source of some of the film's biggest early laughs, as things progress, we realise there's considerably more to his character than initially thought, and he commands what's easily the most moving scene in the whole film. This is Jojo's story, however, with much of the runtime concerned with his attempts to rationalise the cognitive dissonance between what he's been taught and what he can see with his own eyes.<br/><br/>Of course, although set in 1945, Jojo Rabbit is really about the here and now. Essentially, it mocks extremism, people who hate based on ethnicity or religion, with Jojo's belief that Jews are demonic figures capable of powerful magic standing in for people who believe all Muslims are terrorists or all Mexicans are rapists. In this sense, the film isn't about Nazis at all; their role is allegorical. Rather it's partly about the role adults play in inculcating children into hate and partly about exposing the power of propaganda to subvert truth. But so too is it about rising above such ideology, no matter how ingrained it might be, finding the individualistic humanity in the Other, behind the political clich√©. And although all of this is presented humorously, it never becomes didactic or monolithically preachy - Waititi balances his tones too well.<br/><br/>If I were to criticise any element of the film, it would be that Waititi undeniably glosses over some of the more horrific atrocities carried out during the War. The Nazis in the film are, by design, cartoonish, which s done so as to render them as easily dismissed figures to be scorned. The reality, of course, was far darker, and it certainly wouldn't have hurt to have at least one Nazi who isn't a figure of fun. In this sense, the film doesn't represent the awful truth, but it never claims to; this isn't a reality-based examination of Nazism, nor does it try to be.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, and devastating, but mostly hilarious and always hopeful. It's an extraordinarily sweet film without ever becoming saccharine, as Waititi strikes a perfect balance between comedy, tragedy, and drama. It's a very funny World War II film which imparts a vital message for our confused and divided world of today - if we let them, love will always trump hate, hope will always light a way through the darkness. But only if we let them."

While Waititi is more renowned as a comedic director (though many of his films have dramatic elements to them), Jojo Rabbit is a great balance between comedy and drama.<br/><br/>Initially this combination of comedy and drama is a bit jarring, as you'll have some great comedy moments mixed in with some deadly serious, even tragic, dramatic moments. One moment you'll have an hilarious scene where the Nazis are being made fun of, the next you see the tragic effects of their regime. This two-tone approach initially makes the movie quite unsettling.<br/><br/>However, from a point the comedy-drama divide follows a rhythm and things settle down. As the movie goes on the tone becomes more consistently serious, leading to a powerful, profound, emotional conclusion.<br/><br/>Solid performances by Ronan Griffin Davis as Jojo, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa and Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. Waititi himself takes on the Hitler role and does a great job. Outstanding performance of the movie goes to Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, the jaded, alcoholic German Army officer. Absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>Good supporting cast that includes Alfie Allen, Rebel Wilson and Stephen Merchant."

","""Jojo Rabbit"" stars good looking people, some of them doing good things, others saying bad things. One of them doesn't make it through the movie. It has a simple take and a simple lesson: ""Oppression is bad.""<br/><br/>Jojo is a young boy with a young boy's simple view of life. He admires his teachers, and they tell him to admire Hitler. So he does. But he not only admires Hitler from afar, but he interacts with Hitler right in his own room apparently as an imaginary friend/fuhrer. The director, Taika Waititi, dons a somewhat brushier mustache than the mini sported by der real Fuhrer, and plays a buffoonish version of Adolf.<br/><br/>The overall effect is to preach an easy lesson to the young, but like an antivirus, it weakens the power of the adversary. The real Hitler was smart, quick on the uptake, and not known for his gentle humor. And the real nazis practiced mass marches, enforced obedience by the entire population, and at the very least heavy duty beatings to any opposition no matter how slight.<br/><br/>This does not have enough of a grasp on its subject to reach the level of good satire. It remains at a level more like Hogan's Heros. It presents a candy-color superficial grasp of Nazi Germany which barely feels either Nazi or German. Compare this to a much greater movie, ""Cabaret"" which did achieve its aims.<br/><br/>So what is gained by mounting such lightweight stuff? Does it take much courage to fight this, or is Jojo merely overcoming social embarassment? There are several character scenes in this movie, one which is traumatic to the young hero, but its effect is blunted by only showing the victim's dangling feet. It isn't badly done, but its effect is limited because such a heavy time of death and danger is trivialized, particularly at the end with some dance moves being displayed about 2 generations ahead of their development, not to mention many anachronistic expressions and asides.<br/><br/>So I'd describe the movie as a live action comic book to present some 'bad stuff' that happened. This doesn't make it bad. But it is far from great."

"greg-goremykin","10","8","19","22 December 2019"," Waititi hits it out of the park with another off-beat comedy
","And one that made me cry as often as I laughed. I'm admittedly biased as Waititi has been my favourite director since the first time I saw ""Eagle vs Shark"", and I've loved every film of his since.<br/><br/>In this world where cinema seems to be on the decline and destined to maybe only exist on television at some point, and also a world where bland pablum like the endless string of superhero and action films where it is obvious in their execution that the accountants are running the show, so to speak, with films designed specifically to appeal to the widest world-wide demographic possible, films like this are such a welcome breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>I really don't understand all the poor critic reviews, but obviously suspect it has to do with set and setting of this film, but that is part of the beauty of it. Compared to the conclusion of the Star Wars saga, a movie that was all about fan service, with no chance-taking, no surprises, no risks, ""Jojo Rabbit"" stands in such stark and positive comparison specifically because it is the director/writer's creative vision on full display.<br/><br/>Why a touching film can't also include satire with the last days of the Third Reich as the backdrop is something completely lost on me, and smacks of more than a bit of racism, like all Germans who had to live through that era are too inherently evil to portray characters with heart and soul, and in the main character's case, not even a child seems worthy of any redemption. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what some of the critic's reviews feel like.<br/><br/>In any case, sometimes sacred cows make for the most delicious hamburger, and the performances are all outstanding (""Leave No Trace"" was my top film of 2018, so it was a nice surprise to see the incredibly talented, and natural, actress show up in this film as well. Don't let the lack of critical acclaim make you shy away from at least giving this film 20 minutes to see if you can look past the black (and apparently also taboo-breaking) comedy/satire/drama that offends some delicate sensibilities... I'm guessing you won't be disappointed."

Most of the time you only remember movies that were extremely bad or/and the ones that are worth winning awards. Jojo Rabbit deserves its award, Taika Waititi did an excellent job with this war satire. As a comedy it's just genious, the mockery of the Germans or more specifically the Nazis, the satire just drips off it for the entire movie. Making fun of one of the greatest tragedies ever, it's delicate and doesn't work all the time, but in this movie they just laugh about anything and everything, sometimes subtle and sometimes very obvious. I thought it was great and I won't be the only one thinking like that. The cast was top notch. The young Roman Griffin Davis did a great job playing that little Hitlerjungend Jojo. The imaginary Hitler played by Taika Waititi was a great addition to this story. The whole cast added everything needed to make Jojo Rabbit one of the better movies of 2019.

The ensemble is filled with superb acting across the board, and each technical element from production design to costuming is unique yet precise. Additionally, there is a certain moment in the film that was absolutely bone-chilling in which one could feel each and every audience member's mood shift. The shift is executed so perfectly, largely as a result of Taika Waititi's brilliant direction and screenplay. Without his specific guidance in multiple aspects of the film, this could so easily have fallen apart. This is not a movie that should work it all... but damn it sure does. Be sure to update your Oscar predictions because this should go far!!"
"Eclectic-Boogaloo","4","12","33","28 November 2019"," Tone deaf...
","That perfectly describes the last 5 to 10 minutes of Jojo Rabbit-- up to and including its distasteful climax, which ruined what could've still been a good film. I say good, because I had a number of other issues with the movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't funny. It was a toothless satire. An ineffective critique of the Nazi's.<br/><br/>The heart of the film, and what saved it from being a complete disaster where the touching performances of Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa, the Jewish girl, and Scarlett Johansson as the mother of Roman Griffin Davis' title character Jojo. They were beautifully written and performed roles.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi did a good job shooting the film, as its lovely looking, and made for an amusing Hitler for the first 30 minutes, after which the novelty wore off and he was annoying. I also thought Rebel Wilson and Sam Rockwell had a few amusing comic moments. Overall, the film was at its best when Hitler wasn't on-screen and it wasn't trying so hard to be funny and ""satirical."" The drama was the real highlight. Too bad it ended up failing failing on that front.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>
Jojo Rabbit could have had an ending that pulled the heart strings and sent an important message about facing the consequences of your actions and learning from your mistakes. Instead we got a triumph of the human spirit dance-off between a Hitler youth who hadn't yet lived down his mistakes and the Jewish girl who he lied to and held captive just because he felt some butterflies in his stomach and/or missed his mommy. Barf.<br/><br/>
(MORE-SPOILERS)<br/><br/>
Look: Elsa slapped him. Which was good!!! Because He deserved it. She should have left him too: A sad goodbye. Elsa's finally free. Jojo is again left alone and hurt, left to reflect on another valuable lesson. Does he learn and grow from his mistakes? The End.<br/><br/>How hard is that?<br/><br/>No human being would have ever just let the atrocities Elsa experienced roll off them like water off a ducks back. Again, there's some really good craft in this movie but it's torpedoed by some tone-deaf creative choices from its director."

The acting is superb every character feels like they are there for a purpose and are all useful to the movie in one way or another. There are times where the screenplay is truly masterful as well as the visual storytelling. There is on aspect this style of storytelling that involves shoes that is absolutely brilliant and I would almost compare it to the red jacket sequence in Schindler's List in terms of how striking it was. When the film wants to be funny it is and when it wants to be sad and change the tone halfway through it does that so effectively. The humour isn't just dumb as well it is a way of showing how ridiculous some of the beliefs and propaganda of the Nazis were, which I thought was brilliant.<br/><br/>I do have some negatives with film though, whilst the tonal change in the movie is done very effectively it tries to be funny again midway through a sequence that is quite sad and it doesn't feel right in the situation. Also the film has about 10 minutes in the beginning of the 2nd act that I thought had some very slow scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, Jojo Rabbit is one of my favourite films this year and adds another yes another excellent film to 2019's list of great films.

","If this was real life, Jojo would have most likely turned in Elsa and his mother.

And for those who find the whole enterprise to be offensive and in bad taste, I will reiterate the fact that this is a satire and one that has its heart in the right place. With that being said, let's get to the point. What did I think of Jojo Rabbit? I think it was a very good picture that accomplished most of what it set out to do. It was funny, provocative and had a good message. And it had outstanding production and performances. Waititi, Rockwell, Johansson and especially the kids, Davis and McKenzie were terrific in their roles. This is not a perfect picture. Not all of the scenes connected but most did.

We've all seen this type of story many times before, but what makes this movie stand out is the execution from the amazing screenplay and amazing acting. There also still some little surprises from the story, one of which that got me very emotional.<br/><br/>My only minor problem with the movie is I thought it would be funnier. Don't get me wrong, there's still many funny moments, but nothing laugh at loud funny. But I didn't care about the comedy as much, because I was more engaged in the actual story."
"ben-snooks","8","2","3","22 February 2020"," Leave your PC shoes at the door end enjoy it!
","The films doesn't celebrate nazism any more than Indiana Jones does. It's escapism and it's done for comedic effect like Monty Python and many other films have done before with the crusades etc. It's almost a kids movie with a few laughs. I don't think the death of one of the characters was really explained properly though. If you are happy to separate the film from the horrors of reality then you will probably enjoy it. Hollywood asks you to do this all the time for murder investigation films, violent action films, comedy films. These films don't get marked down because people ""could"" find them offensive. Viewers are conditioned all the time to accept things in films that wouldn't be excepted in real life. JoJo Rabbit is an extension of that. Nobody ever said it's supposed to be real. I applaud Scarlett Johansson for taking the role."

","I have mixed feelings.. Certainly, it is a well made movie, with great aesthetic choices, interesting scenes and good characters (Yorki).

I just don't think it was well made. Yorki was easily the best character (followed by K), and I wished everyone else was like that.

Some scenes just don't mesh together too, there are ""boring"" interactions that can be skipped without affecting the plot, and some characters just don't work.<br/><br/>You can tell Taika is still learning or searching for his own style.

","Every war film, even subversive comedies about 'Hitler Youth', contains some heroic action by the American forces (even if they were not there). At the end of the movie which concerns the 'Invasion of Berlin', it looks as if they were fighting hand in hand with the Russians, which kind of ruined the story a bit (did they not show up two months later!?). The rest of the movie is funny, moving and suitably disturbing (in places). I really loved the cast of actors though not too keen on the obese kid with glasses. The stated character would never have been part of this regiment of child soldiers. I think belief in cinema, even within the most fantastic plot structures, is hugely important and please don't muck around with the history. I actually find the changing of military events, way more controversial than any subject matter and everyone (and I mean everyone) is a valid target for jokes; well just ask Mel Brooks.

"matthewsjcha","7","2","3","15 February 2020"," TIFF People's Choice has Some Amazing Moments but Suffers a bit from Awkward Tone Shifts
","At times I enjoyed the comedic moments, and also the times when the movie took itself seriously. However, the two sides of the movie, despite being good in themselves, never really jell for me.<br/><br/>With the opening act introducing comedic moments such as a Nazi Boy Scout being stabbed in the thigh by an errant throwing-knife, the movie had the foundations of a great over-the-top comedy. However, the movie also introduces moments of earnestness that completely shift the movie, at certain times, to a solely sincere tone.<br/><br/>With the introduction of Scarlett Johansson's character as a strong-willed but caring mother, there are some truly heart-warming moments. After she and Jojo have a fight, she caricatures his father and tells Jojo how much he means to her and they embrace in dance. These moments were truly charming, but seemed far displaced with the kind of humor established in the first act.<br/><br/>The eventually fate of Johansson's character did not still very well with me. While she and Jojo have a lovely day out together biking and walking by the river, there is a shot which frames Jojo looking up at her standing on the ledge, with only her legs and shoes in frame. This precious moment is called back to at the reveal of her death, as when Jojo finds her hanging in public, they are positioned the same way in the frame.<br/><br/>While I know how powerfully this captures the sudden tragedies faced by the people affected by Nazi Germany, with the start of the movies being so humorous, some of these serious moments felt a little off.<br/><br/>Another moment that bothered me was the final battle scene. Rockwell finally dons his beautifully-feathered armor and Rebel Wilson's character sends children running into the battlefield with grenades strapped to themselves. Once again it was staged as some amazingly outrageous humor, but with Jojo despairing about the massacre around him along with the sorrowful score, the humor felt way out of place.<br/><br/>Even so, the movie ends on a high point with a moment between Jojo and the girl he had been hiding. The two, finally standing out in the streets, having just been liberated from Nazi rule, dance as pure as possible in such a wholesome ending to the movie.<br/><br/>At times I really like this movie and I want to love it. There are some truly charming, heart-warming moments and at times some great humor. However, its inconsistent tone sometimes led to an awkward combination of these great, stand-alone moments."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","3","2 February 2020"," Some funny moments, some sad moments, overall an okay movie
","""Jojo Rabbit"" is a new American 2019 movie and one of the big players this awards season. First of all, I want to say that it is quite ironic that this film came out pretty much the same time here like a film based on a famous German book about a pink rabbit, but international readers have most likely no clue what I am talking about, so I won't go any further into detail about that. Instead, let's elaborate on these slightly over 105 minutes we have here. Director Waititi is a big star in Hollywood now already obviously as he also gave us his take on the Marvel universe, but this film here is the one that means even more breakthrough for him. He is also credited as the one and only writer who adapted the novel into the screenplay. If it wasn't for Peter Jackson, you could also say that he is the biggest filmmaker from New Zealand ever already, even if he missed out on the Academy Award nomination for Best Director, but he was probably close. The only acting nomination for the Oscars went to Scarlett Johansson and it seems the Academy wants to make it up this year for her by giving her two nominations even after ignoring her for so long. This one here is also her better shot at the win, even if both are very unlikely. Lead actor Roman Griffin Davis, who plays the title character, was nominated for a Golden Globe despite his young age. I am not too mad about that. He was pretty good for sure and especially in the second half, he almost carried the film solely on his shoulders with Johansson and Waititi out of the picture. Yes, Waititi also acts in here. You can see on the poster which character he plays. I am not sure I can write the name and my review will get through. Then again, he does not really play the character, he just plays how a young boy perceives said character if he was his best friend. Sadly, while Waititi was incredibly funny and gave a great performance and also I think had he had more screen time, then he could have been nominated for a supporting Oscar too, I struggled with the way they included him. The things he said frequently felt just written and for the sake of it and not what a boy would make out of them, if he was really a figment of his imagination. This applies especially to the Churchill scene you can also see in the trailer, but also the last appearance from said character when the boy almost banned him out of his mind felt out of place. By then, clearly all his sympathies were gone, so they simply should not have had him return, even if the way he got kicked through the window was pretty epic and funny (like Tarantino blowing himself up in ""Django Unchained""). Don't get me wrong, I think the character added a great deal of entertainment and Waititi gave a really good performance, but in the overall picture it did not feel right to me beyond entertainment.<br/><br/>The cast includes other familiar faces too: Sam Rockwell is doing fine as always and his two acts of kindness stay in the mind. He did not have too much screen time, but when he was on, he was really commanding and you can see why he is an Oscar winner now. I still think he looks way younger than he is. By the way, he was gay in this movie, wasn't he? So he had his own tragic story too that we did not find out too much about. Rebel Wilson is just in it for some funny punchlines and that is alright. She is easy to recognize in every film she is in, but great range she has not, especially not when it goes beyond comedy. But the audience in my showing clearly loved her and I can't deny Waititi wrote her as good as it gets. At the end, we find out that, unlike Rockwell's character, there is really no hope for her soul. Proud Nazi until the very end. Now I already said RDG was pretty good in the lead, but the one I liked even more was Archie Yates. I am not yet sure if it was his performance or just his material, but this kid was a riot honestly. Every scene with him was a winner and I hope I can see him in other projects soon. In general, they did a great job with the casting here. Nobody feels that they could not work the part and I also include Thomasin McKenzie with that. She gets more screen time the longer the film goes and while her story is definitely the most dramatic from all characters involved, she has lighter moments like everybody else. I just wondered why she really believed these letters came from her boyfriend and how she really knew towards the end that he was dead if she did not even know who won the war. Oh well, minor script flaws, but this one still has a shot to win an Oscar there. Script and maybe costumes are the only shots the film has really. Still more than most others. I do think the script would not be undeserving. This film peaks especially with the dialogue writing (there are so many examples, not just Waititi's character), but also those moments when the girl towards the end steps out into the light and can leave the house again without having to fear death. Or the many excellent ways in which Waititi breathed life into the clash between innocent childhood and the cruel world around them. How the boy says near the end that the Germans won and that she must stay was just one example. It had nothing to do with him being evil, just with him being afraid of losing her. Or when he attacks her with the knife and the wound is almost non-existent. All this shows he is a good boy, also because of the way he was raised. He loves his mother dearly and does not see her as an opponent (except the ""rat"" moment maybe), even if he is not happy about her not telling him about the hidden girl. We see him cry so hard when the mother is dead. There are serious moments for sure, but still I think young people can and should watch this film. So does Johansson's character early on when she shows him these people who were murdered for not supporting the Nazis. This is one from a handful scary scenes. Rockwell's final moment. How they turn poor children into soldiers... Another would be right at the very start, the scene with the rabbit, the one that gives Johannes the nickname we see in the film's title. Again this scene shows that he is not evil or cold-blooded and his only reason for being with the Nazis is that he wants to belong somewhere. He basically just repeats what he hears, the best example is all about the Jews really that he also wrote in his book. It shows that he is curious and wants to make up his mind himself when asking the girl about her kind. He does no longer want to just blindly accept what other people say.<br/><br/>Speaking of the girl, this scene with Merchant's character (seeing him first in the trailer I thought it was Lars Eidinger) is among the most memorable from this film. Of course, it is incredibly tense and scary, but it is also over the top (in an entertaining way) and really funny near the end when we see what Jojo wrote and painted about Nathan, the girl's boyfriend. The butterfly scene from before that also stays in the mind. Or the chubby kid's words (for example ""not a good time to be a Nazi"" he was really good in making the simplest statements about really complicated aspects and they still felt real). So yes, this film definitely has far more positive to offer than negative. There were scenes and moments that did not feel too authentic and realistic to me, like some quotes by Jojo felt more from a grown-up and written than actually from a boy his age, which is maybe my biggest criticism. Or how he finds the girl I struggled a bit with. Yes he is a curious boy, but that was really too much effort if you ask me. Or the physical conflict between the two when the girl shows him her strength and that the Germans/Nazis are not really superior in terms of strength. It's not a perfect film, but one that is highly entertaining and stays very memorable too. And even with the sad aspects like Johansson's character dying, it is not a depressing film. The boy lost his mother, but remember he is not an orphan. His dad is still out there somewhere and he can probably return eventually. Or that he basically, one way or the other, has a sister again with what the two went through together that will always unite them. So it is also an uplifting film. This also has to do for sure with what Waititi had in mind about people all ages that should see the film. He certainly succeeded and he would not have, had he turned this into a super depressing political or (anti-) war movie without light moments whatsoever. Instead it is these light moments that dominate the film. Sometimes it had a touch of Wes Anderson to me. And don't be distracted by everybody speaking English here despite the film being set in Germany. This was just a decision because they did not want to cast German actors all along and I don't mind or care at all. You can still watch the German dub if that is a problem for you. For me, it was probably only something that slightly confused me for five minutes or so. Okay I guess this would be all then. I think the rating here on imdb is a bit too high and I can see why some critics did not like it too much, but I personally felt it worked really well as a satire, so no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up and a positive recommendation. It may not be among the best films of 2019, but it certainly is a good achievement and I would say instead, it is among the most different films of the year and truly a unique achievement that oozes creativity and deserves to be checked out for that reason alone. Finally, I want to add as a little closing statement that I watched the film from the perspective of somebody who has not read the book it is based on. I don't think it is necessary at all to do so in order to enjoy the movie, so I cannot talk about differences and parallels between this film and the base material, but I doubt the book is bad or anything if it results into such an interesting film. Certainly closer for me to 4 stars out of 5 (maybe on a rewatch), but for now I will just go with 3."
"owanitall","10","2","3","30 January 2020"," Reality was surreal. They just turned the ""sur"" up a notch.
","Taika Waititi is a very good actor. Yes, of course, he's a brilliant director of possibly the most creative film of the year. And yes, young Roman Griffin Davis did a remarkable job portraying Jojo's journey and all the emotions he goes through. And Scarlett Johansson was marvelous as his mother trying to balance protecting her last surviving child and doing ""what she can"", like hiding a Jewish girl. And Sam Rockwell's Nazi commander drowning his shame in alchohol came across as heartbreakingly human. But if Waititi didn't hit just the right notes as the imaginary Hitler, the entire movie might not have worked. He might have been goofy, hilariously blunt, yet often supportive and encouraging, but he never stopped being Hitler. What this film reflects is the time that seemed surreal. All it really did is turn the ""sur"" up a notch. More often than not whatever is funny is also very scary. And tragedy is acutely real. It stays with you."

","Roman Griffin Davis is looking forward to a week at Hitler Youth Camp. When he fails to demonstrate his dedication to ethnic purity and Nazi ideals by breaking the neck of a rabbit, the rest of the campers start call young Johannes -- that's Master Davis -- ""Jojo Rabbit"". He runs off, naturally, and confers with his goofy imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler, who informs him of the ferocity of rabbits. So Roman runs back, where Sam Rockwell is about to give all the boys a chance to throw a grenade, grabs one, and winds up scarring his face and behind. When he gets out of the hospital, his mother, Scarlett Johansson knees Rockwell in the ... well, it's not the behind.<br/><br/>All perfectly normal in the year 1945, as the Thousand Year Reich's ever victorious army is being shredded, with Russian, American, British, and probably Chinese armies are about to march on the town. It's when Roman discovers that his mother is hiding Thomasina McKenzie, a Jew, in the floorboards behind his dead sister's room, that things begin to get odd. She takes his knife away from him, but they eventually reach a stalemate, because if Miss Johannsson finds out he's found out, then Elsie will have to go. So instead, he begins quizzing her on her diabolical schemes to take over the world, where are the horns on her head * and so forth. It gradually begins to dawn on him that he may not have understood reality perfectly up to now, which is startling for a boy who has achieved the great age of ten and a half to realize.<br/><br/>It's a weird movie about children being asked to grow up too fast. The only movie that feels at all like it is THE DEATH OF STALIN, and this feels way weirder to me. After all, one of my grandfathers was a communist, but everyone agreed that Hitler was the worst person ever. It was so obvious that even the goyim had figured it out, although it took them a war to reach the startling conclusion that someone who had been screaming about Jews, Slavs, Blacks and homosexuals for more than twenty years, and who had killed, oh, all of them he could manage, might not be the nicest guy in the world. It's certainly upsetting to think of him as a goofy imaginary friend.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking. You're thinking ""here's an American Jew who grew up in the aftermath of the Second World War, when about a third of his family had been killed in the Holocaust -- which some of you deny ever happened -- so he has issues! It's not like some one vile, like Justin Trudeau, John Wayne, or Walt Disney, was a goofy imaginary friend, which is impossible, because they were evil incarnate.""<br/><br/>Well, we all have issues, don't we? This is one weird movie. Is it a great movie? It's a weird one.<br/><br/>

"Cineanalyst","7","1","1","29 February 2020"," Springtime for Hitler
","""Jojo Rabbit"" follows in the rich tradition of making buffoons out of Hitler and Nazis, from Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" (1940), Ernst Lubitsch's ""To Be or Not to Be (1942) and Mel Brooks's ""The Producers"" (1967). And, from the start, it's a hilarious successor to those films. The opening credits roll over a montage ludicrously equating Hitler with the Beatles. Beyond the jokes, however, is where I find the picture falters. While some critics appear to fret over the definition of ""satire"" and beg for a lecture that readily applies to today's politics, all of that is rather irrelevant to Taika Waititi's actual movie. Today, we're far removed from WWII; it's no longer the present of Chaplin and Lubitsch's films or part of mainstream living memory as with Brooks. The historical horrors of Nazi Germany are conspicuously absent from ""Jojo Rabbit""--reduced to and rendered mostly by hangings in a town square. Meanwhile, the ground has been softened for a cartoonish Hitler and Nazis recently by re-subtitled videos on YouTube of a scene from ""Downfall"" (2004) or a movie such as ""Look Who's Back,"" (2015) featuring a Hitler interacting with modern Germans, as well as by everything from ""Hogan's Heroes"" to those finer films by Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks. There's hardly anything enlightening or subversive about the humor here, but it's the picture's inevitable sentimentality and derivative style that are the bigger shortcomings.<br/><br/>I've only seen two of his movies thus far, but it's striking how much Waititi rips off from others' movies. His MCU entry, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) stylistically plays like the third installment to the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series, what with the goofball posing to popular music, not to mention the teaming up of misfit prisoners, violent family dynamics and threat of planetary destruction. Now, in this Chaplin-Lubitsch-Brooks-esque black comedy, or satire, or what have you, he lifts the look and sound of Wes Anderson's pictures. Others have aptly compared the Hitler Youth bits and coming-of-age story here to ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012), but with war-mongering white supremacists. Moreover, actors play cute, are framed centrally for cuts back and fourth or are otherwise symmetrically lined up for the camera, bright colors pop, the mood veers wildly between comedic excess and sentimentality, all underscored, again, by popular music, from the Beatles onward. Ironically, Anderson's own picture to be set in the era of WWII, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014), is an exception musically among his oeuvre. Both directors even include some good cigarette jokes. Jojo's imaginary friend Hitler repeatedly offering the boy a smoke might be the funniest bit regarding cancer sticks that I recall since Bill Murray would suck on up to two of them at a time in ""Rushmore"" (1998).<br/><br/>Never mind that the real Hitler was the original former smoker turned anti-smoking Nazi. Or that Hitler's vegetarianism is ignored here in favor of his imaginary version feasting on unicorn heads, or that much of Waititi's interpretation of him revolves around anachronisms. This is historical revisionism to the point of pop-culture memes. The bigoted boy scout, Jojo's other secret friend besides silly f√É¬ºhrer is, as a Jewish girl living in his attic, helping him to compose a book (in this case, one full of anti-Semitic tropes), a simplistic variation on Anne Frank. There's also the business of dance standing in for freedom here. It pales in comparison to the artistic reflexivity that lifted the works of Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks. Chaplin exploited the duality inherent in cinema and the dramedy of humor and horror of his scenario by playing dual roles. Lubitsch did likewise with the play-within-play structure, of actors playing actors. Ditto Brooks. All included sham Hitlers. Waititi's Hitler, on the other hand, is simply imaginary--reflecting the ideology Jojo has absorbed from the culture and propaganda of Nazi Germany. Minus the bigotry of it all, it's not unlike what Waititi has done in his cinematic copycatting. And, in the end, all we get is a trite moral from the boy's budding friendship with the girl in his attic, to not hate... and dance, or something.<br/><br/>Regardless, I still enjoyed ""Jojo Rabbit."" The comedy is naturally not as edgy as when Chaplin, Lubitsch and Brooks made Nazis the butt of jokes, but even when the humor here is juvenile, it tends to be enough over-the-top to remain fun. Scarlett Johansson is especially a delight in her Oscar-nominated role--perhaps, particularly because hers is the only character that seems to acknowledge the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich, although she, too, frolics about in the spring with her son, Jojo. Newcomer Roman Griffith Davis, as Jojo, is impressive, besides also looking convincingly like he could be related to Johansson. The rest of the cast is serviceable, including Sam Rockwell reprising his Oscar-winning violent racist who performs a redemptive act of kindness for another from ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017). If the characters here weren't mostly reused caricatures, though, and if Jojo running around when the war finally does reach his sleepy village didn't resemble Corporal Upham hiding throughout a recycled set from ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1999), if Waititi didn't crib so much from Anderson and others in general and resort to a predictably sugary denouement, I wouldn't be ambivalent in my enjoyment."
"fscouto2001","10","1","1","28 February 2020"," A beautiful satire
","Jojo Rabbit possesses somethings most movies only try to get. It is a powerful satire anti hate with touches of a light comedy about a kid who doesn't know his place in the world and believes what he is told to just to feel he belongs somewhere. The first half will bring you tears of laugh and the second one tears of sadness. But the way it combines both is truly special. Jojo rabbit is a beautiful story impulsed by the eccentric but wise vision of Taika Waititi."

","I've been wanting to watch Jojo Rabbit since a pretty long time now but I was repelling it because I wasn't so sure about the mix between Nazi Germany and comedy, it felt kinda off-putting at first. But oh was I wrong!<br/><br/>To put it simply, Jojo Rabbit is an EXCELLENT movie. It's fascinating to see the Nazi propaganda through the eyes of a 10 year old boy (Jojo), a proud Hitler Youth fan, who is trying to find his place in this complex world. The comedy is brilliant and it's overall a pretty original take on a Nazi satire.<br/><br/>This movie touched me deeply. Some scenes are jaw-dropping, I wasn't prepared for that.

'War' should not be a lie we have created for children, because it is for them. Too cruel I love my country, but I hate war. ""Jojo Rabbit"" shows us the cruelty of World War II from the perspective of a child who loves 'Nazi' and Hitler enthusiastically, and wraps the core of tragedy under its comedy shell.

","*I don't know why but my review was severely edited by imdb. They removed all my experience with recent antisemitism and how hearing the antisemitism was difficult to hear* It is all necessary to make the story complete. Jojo being indoctrinated at a young age into Hitler youth and not realizing how ridiculous those ideas really are until he learns for himself that, yes, Jewish people ARE PEOPLE TOO! It was heartbreaking and funny all at the same time.
Hitler as his imaginary friend was absurd to me at first, but this is through the eyes of a young boy. Things are all fun and games until the horrors of war really hits home. Having Jojo realize hating people for no reason is wrong and that the one person he has left in his life is the one person he was brought up to hate and kill was very beautiful.<br/><br/>It felt influenced by Wes Anderson, who I like a lot.<br/><br/>It left me in tears at the end."

"cruise01","10","1","1","21 February 2020"," Take Waititi's direction, humor, and charm delivers again.
","Jojo Rabbit (5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is a comedy drama film that goes over a dark serious event of WWII but with a little Taika Waititi's script and direction of humor, and charm. This film delivers. It is a lot of fun, has some quirky humor, a great cast, and a plot about a serious and dark issue but with a little heart in it. This kind of film is not going to be for everyone. It is what it is with this kind of movie. Audiences may have trouble connecting to the main character Jojo, a kid who is trying to be a Nazi. He is raised different, sees the world in a blind eye. But it is also a coming of age kind of story being caught in the world of conflict. It is one of those plots were it is best to see for yourself than read about it cause it does not sound appealing especially over the issue with the kid trying to be a nazi.<br/><br/>The plot follows Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) a young boy in Germany. His father is absent cause he is sent out in the war. And he lost his sister to some sickness. While his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is caring and sweet. Jojo is sent out to a boys camp for Hitler's youth training. Led by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), and his assistants Fraulen (Rebel Wilson) and Finkel (Alfie Allen). When an accident sends Jojo home. Jojo finds out his mother has been hiding a teenage jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie). Jojo afraid and hesitant on living with this girl. He tries to aid in keeping her hidden.<br/><br/>The plot is great. It is a coming of age story during WWII. And being raised to follow a Hitler's laws. Jojo's world is turned upside down when he sees that his mother is part of the resistance and helping a young girl hide in their home. Jojo was stuck in believing the horrible rumors on what he thought the Jews are. While learning from Elsa that her and him are not so different.<br/><br/>The cast ensemble is great. Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie are great with the lead roles. They are sweet and delivered fun roles. Taika Waititi plays Adolf Hitler as a imagination that talks to Jojo. Jojo has an imaginary friend that is Hitler that tries to keep him company. Taika Waititi's performance humor is a lot of fun to watch. Rebel Wilson, Alfie Allen, Sam Rockwell, and Scarlett Johansson are all great with their performances.<br/><br/>The film's script and direction is a lot of fun. The characters are fun. The humor is entertaining. And the story is charming and goes over a serious dark time about loss and friendships.<br/><br/>Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a great film. It is entertaining. Fun. And charming with its story. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
"Solnichka","10","1","1","21 February 2020"," Excellent movie and the best film of 2019, by far
","There is a certain charm to this film, despite the content that explores Nazi youth culture in a satirical way. The acting is fantastic from the young boy to the more-established stars in the film. No idea why Roman Griffin Davis was not nominated for an Oscar in the leading actor category. There are some Wes Anderson-type moments in the film, too, and that could make or break it for some viewers, of course, but those moments are brilliant. You will laugh with this film, and you will cry with it-at least twice. It's excellent commentary on modern political situations in the U.S., which probably hits too close to home for some conservatives. Highly recommend, as this film was better than _Parasite_ and way better than _1917_ in terms of its cinematic achievement."

"ovaere_robin","10","1","1","20 February 2020"," It's not comedy, it's the war from the eyes of a child
","Let me start with saying that this movie is quite historical correct and is filmed completly from the mind of a young 10 year old boy that is very happy with his life so far. This boy is introctinated with Nazi propaganda, Hitler is the man he looks up to, even more, his imaginary friend is Hitler. Not the real one offcoarse, he is imaganary so Hitler his behaviour is a mix between the real one and a child.<br/><br/>This gives the movie an intresting start because children were indeed indroctinated, they went into the Hitler Jugend and the movie doesn't alter that from a historical point of view. The other characters behave not like you would expect but also again from how the boy sees it.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses he is forced to start to doubt everything he believes and tries to comprehend as he is confronted with al the terrors at the end of a war, sometimes it's a bit funny, sometimes you will be shocked.<br/><br/>The movie goes over a lot of topics that are very risky to touch: manipulating children with the Hitlerjugend, using and sacrificing children in a war that was already lost (the defense of Berlin was in fact for the largest part the Hitlerjugend), how the Nazi portrayed Jews and actually believed it next to other more usual topics you would expect.<br/><br/>In one scene where bullets are flying trough the sky and the boy is confused as he doesn't comprehend anything he looks at 2 german soldiers that are fighting dressed in funny clothes decorated with pink triangles what confuses him even more.<br/><br/>The movie will not tell you what that ment because the boy will never understand it in his life but neither will most viewers do. In case you wonder what the fuss is about the pink triangle, it was given under article 175 that sended you off to a concentration camp where you would die a lot faster then if you were given a star of david. Article 175 stayed in effect, survivors of concentration camps were send of to prison after the war, Germany first reconized this in 2002, in 2018 the German president asked for forgiveniss for this ""suffering and injustice"".<br/><br/>But from the perspective of this child, he only sees funny clothes, pink triangles and that it has something to do with the Nazi's. The rest of the story will be somehting for a future generation, that is how deep this movie actualy goes.<br/><br/>Yet the movie has it funny moments because the mind of a child under extreme pressure behaves not like you would expect.
Not everyone will see the movie as I do, some will see it as satire and more comedy. Others will find it a very strange movie, that is something you will have to find out for yourself."

","Ever since the trailers for JoJo Rabbit came out, I was a bit nervous about the film and whether will it be able to handle such a delicate subject in a satirical manner but Taika Waititi proved me wrong.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about a boy (Roman Griffin Davies) imagining him being friends with Hitler (Taika Waititi) who gives him advice on how to be a Nazi. He later finds out that his mother (Scarlett Johannson) is harboring a young Jewish woman upstairs in the wall. The boy being a radical Hitler supporter has to come in terms with his morals.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi successfully changed the tone of the film in a second, making it play with your emotions. He was able to maintain a balance between them.<br/><br/>The cinematography and production design was spot on. It legit felt like a World War 2 setting. The soundtrack for the film felt a bit offtrack and did not amplify the movie experience in any way.<br/><br/>The cast is packed with some fan favorites like Stephen Merchant, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson.

","Best film I've seen this year and one of the best I've ever seen. Waititi's previous work did not prepare me for the depth and beauty of this tale. Films rarely bring tears to my eyes, but this one did. That said, I laughed a lot as well.<br/><br/>Several love stories, a riveting suspense story, an observation on the vulnerability and flexibility of young minds, a coming of age story, a tragedy and a hilarious and biting satire on hatred, in which love prevails, and more...<br/><br/>The soundtrack is an economic use of great music, always perfectly placed. Two beautiful young protaganists with a fine ensemble cast of stars who are always absolutely brilliant. And an ACTUAL STORY! Which is becoming a rare thing in this post millenial era of film making.<br/><br/>Now that he has entered the 'A' list I am really looking forward to Waititi's next film.

","This movie pretends to be all anti-war and anti-hate and yet it praises in many shots how Americans liberated Germans from the Nazis and made it first to Berlin by showing their flags and not showing any Soviet flags when we all know and it's a fact that Soviets made it first to Berlin. They show ""ruthless"" Soviets executing the Nazis and Americans being all full of joy and freedom. They didn't show the Nazis shoting, executing anyone, showing them silly and not serious at all. They obviously tried to make us feel sorry for the people of the Nazi Germany and yes, obviously by far not all the people were followers of this people-hating ideology, especially young people. I understand that it's a satire but why Soviets are being portayed like this then? Soviet Union lost the most amount of people during the Nazi occupation and war. It was Hitler's official orders of exterminating people, slavs in eastern Europe just like Jews or making slaves of them at best. Americans and people in the Western Europe often tend to forget this or simply ignore this horrible fact Now they dare to blacken Soviet achievments once again of not only liberating a good part of Europe but also defeating the Nazis at their very core while being one of the main targets of genocide without declaration of war and not being ready for war which was the reason of Ribbentrop Molotov Pact, to delay the war. The Nazis didn't plan on exterminating people of USA, Great Brittain, France, Norway and Etc. Americans and Brittish didn't have the Nazis on their land doing atrocities towards their women and children. Soviets had more than enough reasons for revenge and yet Stalin banned lynching and looting and punished own people for such things. So again, this movie is about anti-war and anti-hate, about love and friendship of peoples and yet it hypocritically shows how it doesn't apply to Soviet and Russian people. Double standards as always but I am surprised anyway that they did this again. I can't rate this movie higher than the minimum score for obvious reasons. I'm frustrated."

There is no reason for this film to exist, as far as I'm concerned. The style is seems to riff on Wes Anderson, to the point where he should probably be asking for a royalty. Except it comes across as a ""poor man's"" version of it.<br/><br/>And there is a Disney war propaganda cartoon made in 1943 called ""Der Fuehrer's Face"" that captures the exact same essence of ""JoJo Rabbit"" - the absurdity of the Nazi beliefs and Hitler as the buffoon - and does a better job of it. Not many people nowadays have seen that old short, but ""JoJo Rabbit"" basically rips it off (particularly the ""Heil Hitler"" gags). I enjoyed that short cartoon far more then I enjoyed JoJo Rabbit and recommend you check it out.<br/><br/>I could perhaps forgive the derivative nature of the film if it was actually clever or funny, but it is neither. The humour is all one-note low brow slapstick. And there is a confusing juxtaposition at play between absurd and completely unrealistic comedy while ALSO trying to insert entirely serious (and old as dirt) messages about war and fascism. The two work together like oil and water.<br/><br/>I am coming to the conclusion that the only reason this film got so much attention from the Academy Awards was that it was this years ""woke"" choice - a film where the message trumps the filmmaking.

imaginary friend, Hitler (director Taika Waitti), is an ineffectual bumbler, who gives Jojo solace in rough times.<br/><br/>If you hate Hitler, you'll enjoy the satire; if you love him, well, you can enjoy news about your favorite dictator and skip this satire.<br/><br/>Jojo, himself an ineffectual and impossibly cute 10-year-old, not only has to face the dwindling power of the Reich but also the fact that his mother, Rosie (Scarlet Johansson), is harboring a young Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie).<br/><br/>Anne Frank anyone? Like so many participants in that WWII scenario, Jojo must decide between party loyalty and humanity when he decides whether or not to report Elsa.<br/><br/>In the first part of the film, so much is lighthearted (think Hogan's Heroes or Life is Beautiful), that you could forget the baseline horror, which the film treats as Wes Anderson might with serio-comic attitude. Helping to lighten things is hipster anachronistic dialogue like ""intense"" and ""correctamundo"" and slapstick set pieces that ease the inevitable tension from hinting at Holocaust.<br/><br/>The second part turns melancholic when Jojo decides what to do with his ""girlfriend"" Elsa and the Allies are about to change everything. The tone is right, between the uncomfortable struggle before the allies arrive and the new freedom that will demand a maturity and independence Jojo has never had under the Nazis.<br/><br/>Writer-director Taika Waititi has crafted a powerful yet delicate comedy of the world's most horrible story. For attempting to satirize Nazis and be poignant and positive, he should be praised. For the feel-good ending, he should again be rewarded, even if it feels counter intuitive given the horrific history.<br/><br/>""You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a ten-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club."" Elsa"

","I started watching this without any bias at all, ready to give it a rating without holding back. Well this definitely deserves a 9, here's why.<br/><br/>Plot:
We mainly follow along the young boy (jojo) and his imaginary ""friend"" Hitler. I absolutely loved the story of this, it's so wholesome and yet very comedic with a really dark comedy like vibe but suitable for the whole family. There are definitely some edgy jokes but the story is done really well where it's funny, respectful, and very endearing.<br/><br/>Acting:
The cast is really great, they obviously took their time to choose the right people. Jojo was played by a very talented kid who did a great job as well as the Jewish girl. Taika did a really good job at delivering a funny performance yet very unique performance of hitler.
You really get a sense of feeling towards all the characters and that's done by good writing, characterization and acting.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
It's good, they dont rely too much to cgi but theres some cool bits in there. The story doesn't really involve much affects but when they do have them, they're done well. All the shots are great as well.<br/><br/>Summary:
A very good movie which I believe you should definitely watch. In fact it was so good I could probably watch it again. And I absolutely hate watching movies more than once."

","Like life itself, this film runs the gamut from gut-wrenching tragedy to the absurdly comedic, asking audience members to view it through both the innocent/playful of eyes of a child and the profound lens of the sage.

From the first shot it reminded me of Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom (2012), that I loved, and it spread out and deepened up to the last scene. Sure, it's goofy, but life is goofy. Just look at our current politics (and political leaders). Every personality in this movie is over the top, which makes it an anti-documentary that rings more true than not. The child protagonist reminded me of The Kid in Charlie Chaplin's movie of that name. Sadly, there was only one other person in the audience at today's suburban afternoon weekday matinee. The tone of JoJo Rabbit won't be everyone's cup of tea but I encourage every slightly bent, broken, or discouraged movie goer to roll the dice and see this minor masterpiece. If your choice is either JoJo Rabbit or a presidential rally, fellow citizens choose life over death."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","3","6","8 February 2020"," A funny and poignant view of WWII from the eyes of a German boy.
","When I first saw the trailers for Jojo Rabbit (2019), I thought this movie looked like a fun and satirical romp through Nazi Germany. With the director (Taika Waititi) portraying an imaginary Adolf Hitler, the comedy was in full display during the trailers. After all, Waititi directed Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which is arguably one of the funniest films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Plus, Jojo Rabbit seemed to focus on a 10-year-old boy (Roman Griffin Davis) in the Hitler Youth, which gave some strong Boy Scout vibes that I could potentially relate to.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed to find that the trailers contained all the comedy in Jojo Rabbit. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as the remainder of the film gave some amount of cynicism and reality to the fanatical enthusiasm of Jojo and the other members of the Hitler Youth. In fact, there's a significant scene that really hits home with the constant theme of tying shoelaces leading up to (and after) this emotional moment. At its base, Jojo Rabbit also has to show the ugliness of war. It highlights the contrast between the nastiness of the real Hitler and the silliness of an imaginary Hitler.<br/><br/>While it wasn't entirely what I expected, Jojo Rabbit did deliver in a few key areas. First off, the feel of the whole film seemed reminiscent of Moonrise Kingdom (2012), which is one of my favorite Wes Anderson films (again, see my connection to the Boy Scouts). Add in heavy doses of The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) and All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), and the result is this unique take on life in Germany during World War II. It might not have been entirely what I had expected (toning down and trimming a lot of the aspects from the book, Caging Skies), but it was entirely what I needed to see.<br/><br/>A funny and poignant view of WWII from the eyes of a German boy, I give Jojo Rabbit 3.5 stars out of 5."
"quietgrave","8","3","6","7 February 2020"," A refreshing break from the saturated WW2 movie routine.
","The comedy was more than its main selling point, the acting was probably the best I've seen from younger actors in a long time and the costume design was really well done, achieving more than just being icing on a Setting cake. Some of the dialogue and shot comp was definitely inspired by Wes Anderson, which was sometimes a bit distracting, however it made up for it with the characters actually delivering the dialogue with emotion. Every character felt unique and realistic, all of the actors brought their A-game and really committed to their characters nicely."
"Turfseer","4","3","6","7 February 2020"," Happy ending for Hitler Youth, as Nazis get their comeuppance, doesn't sit right
","Writer/Director Taika Waititi is not the first filmmaker to use farce to satirize the Third Reich. In 1940, Charlie Chaplin attempted to mock the Nazis in his first full sound film, The Great Dictator. After the war, Chaplin was quoted as saying that had he known about Hitler's program of genocide, he would never have made The Great Dictator.<br/><br/>
Chaplin implicitly recognized later on, that turning Hitler into a buffoon was not the proper strategy to expose the Nazis for what they were. It was a cheap strategy in which viewers reveled in the Nazis' comeuppance ex post facto (the buffoon being the perfect straw man-easily punctured like a papier-m√¢ch√© pi√±ata). The sad reality is, of course, that aside from their ultimate defeat, the Nazis were successful in bringing misery to a vast number of their victims.<br/><br/>
Here Waititi employs the same strategy in having Hitler (played by Waititi himself) become the imaginary playmate of his protagonist, ten year old Johannes ""Jojo"" Beltzer (Roman Griffin Davis), an aspiring member of the Hitler Youth. There's nothing wrong with the concept of having a ten year old German boy in the waning days of World War II, having Hitler as an imaginary friend. But wouldn't it have been a much darker (and perhaps a much more accurate portrait) to have Hitler be more manipulative and seductive?<br/><br/>
So when Jojo refuses to kill the rabbit while ensconced at the Hitler Youth camp, Hitler pretends to sympathize with Jojo as he does in the film. But later (as an alternate scenario), through his persuasive powers, he convinces the boy to change his mind, and make it seem like, ""yes, it's okay to go ahead and kill the rabbit."" That would be much more in line with the way many of these kids turned out under the spell of a Svengali like Hitler.<br/><br/>
But as is the case with many European post-war filmmakers (and especially German ones), there always has to be at least one ""good German,"" to balance out the horror of the Nazi characters (if you're German, the plaintive cry that ""not all of us were and are bad"" must be ubiquitous). It's a noble sentiment but sometimes leads to the wrong impression that Nazi perfidy wasn't as widespread or perhaps there was ALWAYS a significant counterbalance of good Germans, who were ever present to ""do the right thing"" (i.e. opposing the genocidal madness of fanatical adherents of the Nazi regime).<br/><br/>
So not only does Waititi promote Jojo as one of his good Germans who turned out to be good (and not one of those fanatical Hitler Youth who fought in the streets of Berlin to the very end), but there's also the one-eyed Wehrmacht Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), another buffoon of a character, who ends up sticking up for the Jews, thwarting the Gestapo and saving Jojo from certain execution by the Russians, after they emerge triumphant against the Nazis.<br/><br/>
And Waititi insists on introducing some more ""good Germans"" (this time much closer to home) in the form of Jojo's mom, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson ), who has been hiding a Jewish teenager, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in a secret room throughout the war. It's all part of Waititi's strategy to promote a pyrrhic victory-the good guys facilitate their comeuppance against the bumbling Nazis.<br/><br/>
Elsa, in particular, turns out to be a virtual super girl-convincing Jojo of the error of his belief in the ""Master Race"" and outwitting the Gestapo in the crucial ""dark moment"" at the end of the second act. There are no truly fleshed out characters in Jojo Rabbit-only those designed to protect the audience from grasping the true nature of Nazism and reducing them to ordinary, clownish villains in Waititi's generic ""anti-hate"" campaign.<br/><br/>
On the other hand, when Waititi eschews turning his Nazis into perennial clowns, he's more successful (and makes one feel he's getting at ""something""). There are ""glimpses"" throughout Jojo Rabbit of the darker side. I'm thinking of scenes such as when Jojo's fellow Hitler Youth kill the rabbit, or when we see Jojo's drawings of the repulsive caricatures of Jews in his notebook or the aftermath of the murder of Rosie, hung in the streets after being outed as a collaborator with the resistance.<br/><br/>
Waititi's most revolutionary gesture is the politically incorrect way in which he depicts the anti-Semitism of ordinary Germans. Even the goodly Jojo is infected by the scourge of ""Jew hatred."" While we never see any fanatic Nazis talking about extermination, the banality of such ordinary ""shop talk"" is indicative of the kind of racism inculcated in the minds of those who indulged in what Hannah Arendt termed ""the banality of evil.""<br/><br/>
In the end, however, Waititi serves up a predictable happy ending, again promoting the comeuppance of a group who in reality were the victors in the game of genocidal madness (in reality did Hitler get his just desserts?-not really...he killed himself in the bunker but was responsible for murdering millions).<br/><br/>
For those kids who went to their death as committed Nazis, the rest of the remnants of the Hitler Youth (like Jojo) who underwent de-Nazification, did not emerge ""dancing in the streets"" upon liberation (in contrast to the happy Jojo and Elsa). Indeed, it took these kids years to overcome the horrific conditioning imposed upon them by legions of brutal taskmasters-hardly a group of certified buffoons."

","It's amazing what a good sense of humor can do. In the case of Jojo Rabbit humor is used to show the absolute ridiculousness of the Hitler Jugend, de-power the f√ºhrer himself and tell us the incredibly brave story of resistance against the Nazi's within Germany itself.
The film isn't flawless because it doesn't spread the necessary information evenly, but when you're laughing out loud, asking 'did they really just go there?' or screaming 'no they didn't!', you'll forgive and forget any mistakes immediately. So far, so funny, but to top it all off it gives us a few brilliant moments where you are reminded of the subject matter we're really dealing with: the hell that came to Earth called World War II. And the power of a young boy his love for the people around him.

"ewanfortune","10","3","6","4 January 2020"," Stunning
","A single word can't do justice to this film but this is as close as you'll get. A hilarious satire full of heart and moments of gut-punching tragedy. Following movies such as 'What We Do In The Shadows' and 'Thor: Ragnarok', Taika Waititi has cemented his place as a master with 'Jojo Rabbit'. The writing is perfect and had me laughing throughout as well as my Mom who was still laughing while driving home at ""His face looks like a Picasso painting"", one of the many, many funny quotes throughout. Luckily she didn't crash and/or wet herself. Perhaps one of the funniest moments is Stephen Merchant's first scene, when an uproarious minute of ""Heil Hitler-ing"" takes place which includes a fantastic shot of Merchant towering over Sam Rockwell.
The performances are fantastic from top to bottom, from younger stars Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie, whose relationship develops very nicely, to veterans like Scarlett Johansson who balance comedy and emotion beautifully. Rockwell is a scene stealer as the closeted Nazi and earns our sympathy by the films end. Taika Waititi is outrageous as Hitler, getting to the point where Mom was on the verge of tears by his mere presence on screen.
For as funny as it is, the film isn't without its heart breaking moments. If you've seen the movie all I have to do is mention the shoes and you know what I'm talking about. It's a tragic moment that took my breath away. However, for a tone shift so drastic, it doesn't feel out of place thanks to Waititi's brilliant direction. When the German version of 'Heroes' kicks in at the end with a snap of Griffin Davis' fingers just before the credits roll, I knew I had just witnessed something special. A modern classic already."

","Coming from German heritage, the first 10 minutes of this movie made me squirm uncomfortably as I looked around the theatre too see whether Nazi humour/satire was now OK. The opening shots also showed the fanatic crowds from Hitlers rally's which left the viewer in no doubts about the sway the National Socialists had over much of the German public. In this context, the film displayed the comic genius of the director, as well as the most moving acting by the main child actors and Jo Jos mother beautifully played by Scarlet Johannson. Hilarious and moving. You won't be disappointed."

","Jojo Rabbit was one the best films I have seen recently. It weaves a poignant message through stellar acting and comical satire while not washing over the incredibly dark subject matter.

"stefstars","9","3","6","26 December 2019"," The Light in The Dark
","I was weary of watching this one due to articles that discussed how wrong it is to make comedic films about real life tragedies. However, this film isn't fully a comedy, nor is it entirely a drama. It has a balance of both. I'm glad I watched this film rather than go by the articles written by people who just don't get it, though they like think to they do; ""it"" meaning anything having to do with discrimination, sexism, etc. & that's coming from a woman of color.<br/><br/>I laughed, I cried, I cheered (at imaginary Hitler's fate at the end) it was a fantastic watch. The boy playing Jojo is adorable, his expressions were great, you can truly see him emotionally growing as a character as the movie progresses. Rebel Wilson was hilarious, as expected. Don't be offended by the story her nazi character tells by the pool, it's to show the absurdity of nazi mentality. I don't understand why critics bashed Scarlett Johansson's performance in this film. She was great and I loved her character. Ignore the critics that say she didn't give as much to this performance or I even came across one that said ""she wasn't comedic enough"", she was fantastic. She played the role as she should have and I hope she gets proper recognition for it. As for Waititi's Hitler, he takes the Charlie Chaplin route in making Hitler seem as ridiculous as possible, which when looking at that waste of space for what he was, is quite accurate. The difference is this Hitler didn't make me laugh as much as Chaplin's Hitler. He's meant to be comedic relief but didn't really do it for me. That was the one thing that didn't do it for me. It's an ""I get it, it ain't making me laugh, but I get it"" sort of thing.<br/><br/>All in all, as you can tell by now, I loved this film and it deserves all the praise it's getting. Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed. If you are, well it's okay to be wrong sometimes. Congrats to the cast and crew on making such an amazing film."

"garethcrook","7","6","16","3 January 2020"," Odd mix...
","So this has had some mixed reviews and I can see why. Anyone who's watched the trailer and isn't caught a little off guard by the sight of a jovial Hitler... well surely those people don't exist anymore. Anyway it's clearly meant as offbeat satire, something that director Taika Waititi is known for and known to be fantastic at (What We Do in the Shadows). It is funny ""Get together kids, it's time to burn some books""... but really not nearly as funny as it needs to be to get away with this kind of humour. Mel Brooks' Hitler in The Producers was funny, an out an out piss-take, but here the comedy doesn't seem quite farcical enough. For every ""We have a job for you walking the clones"", there's people hanging in the town square and Jews hiding for their lives. It's a really odd balancing act. I'm not going to slate it, I think it tries really hard to poke fun, but it's just a really difficult subject to have fun with, especially when the story is told through the eyes of a member of the nazi youth clinging on wilfully to his indoctrination. It's an odd mix between the Diary of Anne a frank and Moonrise Kingdom, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, laugh a little and find it interesting. Sam Rockwell is pretty great, Scarlett Johansson is good as the closest thing to an anchor and voice of reason against nazi propaganda, Rebel Wilson though is a bit annoying. There are some genuinely great lines ""There are no weak Jews, I'm descended from those who wrestle angels and kill giants, we were chosen by god, you were chosen by a pathetic little man who can't even grow a full moustache"", but I'm really not sure what to make of it and might need to watch it again. The scenes between the two young leads are intriguing and offer the most depth as the nazi gets an education he doesn't realise he needs. A visit from the Gestapo is a shocking leveller though amongst the frivolity and again makes the humour feel oddly misplaced. Some will love this and quite understandably so, others will feel uncomfortable, but regardless I think it's a must see film... probably more than once, if only just to see Hitler kicked through a window."

I always thought that had someone stood up in one of those Munich beer halls and laughed at Hitler, showing the rest of the deranged crowd what a ridiculous little a-hole he was, we could have side-stepped the worst chapter in human history.<br/><br/>Laugh out loud funny at times. The bit about the mix up of the dogs was my favorite joke in the film, giving the very funny Sam Rockwell the best line in the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was superb all around. The little boy was masterful. I always blame good and bad acting on the director, so chapeau to Taika Waititi. Getting a good performance out of a child is always a masterful performance by the director."

","As suggested by other comments, I looked up the definition of satire and watched the trailers. However, I find little humor in Hitler and his youth.

Today, maybe Hitler is funny and tomorrow maybe Stalin, Mao, or Kim. A lot of people died fighting these regimes.<br/><br/>This is why I have mostly abandoned Hollywood.

"Benslie","9","6","17","25 December 2019"," A hilarious movie that can also be serious
","First of all, this movie does an incredible job of juggling around its tones. This is a comedy movie at its finest but it's also a serious movie and Taika Waititi, who wrote, directed and plays Adolf Hitler, did a spectacular job of juggling them and knowing when to make a joke and when to hold back for the more serious scenes. Not a lot of movies are able to this and it helps this movie stand out among the rest. With the movie switching tones, the cast has to be able to switch to and man oh man did they get great actors for this movie. From the seasonal actors that we all know to the up and coming kid actors everybody just did a stellar job. There were two actors that really stood out to me and that was Roman Griffin Davis and Taika Waititi. I learned this online and I wanted to share this because it's just funny but one reason why Taika Waititi was amazing as Adolf Hitler is because he's Jewish so getting to play a silly version of him is just the biggest fork you, sorry but I had to say it, to him. Even not knowing that information he's still hilarious in this role. But the real stand out definitely was Roman Griffin Davis as the title character. This is his first film role, at least that's what IMDB told me, and he definitely has a bright future ahead of himself. He easily switched from comedic and drama so effortlessly that it made for an interesting main character with depth to him. In the end, Jojo Rabbit is a great movie that when it's released on DVD and Blue-Ray I highly recommended checking it out, you won't regret it."
"nekosensei","10","7","21","2 November 2019"," The Waititi version
","While the American movie world raved over the mediocre ""Joker,"" Taika Waititi's latest slipped quietly into limited distribution to a chorus of critical yawns. We've seen SO many stories like this before, Schindler's List, The Book Thief, The Nightingale, yadayadayada. Who is this Taika again? The one who directed Thor: Ragnarok? Whateva!<br/><br/>Except that in case you've actually been paying attention to Waititi's career--I mean, to the superb series of pictures he's made in addition toThor Ragnarok and What We Do In The Shadows--Jojo Rabbit is a superlative addition to the growing oeuvre of arguably the finest living film director working in the English language. If you haven't seen Boy, Eagle vs. Shark, or Hunt for the Wilderpeople (not to mention the Oscar-nominated short Two Cars, One Night that Boy is based on) you may well watch Jojo Rabbit with the blase attitude of someone who can't enjoy the pleasure that only comes from recognizing and grooving on the unique point of view of a first-class auteur. I'll add that every great Jewish artist must at some point grapple with the Holocaust, and I'm happy that Taika got to do it sooner rather than later, especially when he was still young enough to play the role of Jojo's imaginary friend Hitler and thus give the two fingers up to that contemptible mass murderer who is still so shamefully revered in so many places around the world, particularly here in the U.S. Go Taika!"

"JohnRayPeterson","9","4","10","12 January 2020"," Brilliant; I couldn't find others words to adequately summarize it
","It takes a lot to combine all the elements in this movie, humour, satire, slapstick and tragedy. As best as I could figure, the tragedy of war, the cruelty of nazism, the kindness and love of a mother and her heroic sacrifice, as well as the innocence of a child, not to mention an Anne Frank like character thrown into the mix required a special glue to bind it all, the wacky satire was that glue. If it's not, I'll be damned if I can explain how else the movie worked because I was moved by it.<br/><br/>A first time eleven year old actor, Roman Griffin Davis, has the main character role, Jojo, and he has the bulk of the acting time in this movie; this is definitely proof that this kid has talent, because he is believable throughout all of it. Scarlett Johansson has far less screen time but what little of it she has, as Jojo's mom, she delivers with inspiration, including the funny bits in her early appearance confronting Captain Klensendorf, played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell is an actor I've liked for a long time and I'm happy to say he's had a very good year with this performance and the one in ""Best of Enemies""; he's also acting in ""Richard Jewell and in the mini-series ""Fosse/Verdon"" which I'll be catching soon. Spoiler: He saves the life of Elsa and of Jojo, respectively by covering for Elsa's impersonation of Jojo's dead sister when the Gestapo conducts a search of Jojo's home, then by faking his nazi outrage toward Jojo so he would not be taken in as a supporter, just before a bomb blast kills him, one that would have killed Jojo as well. I had to mention it as Klensendorf's is pretty much of a buffoon the rest of the time and some might miss that.<br/><br/>This leaves one more actor, Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa, the Anne Frank like character because she is hiding in Jojo's home, behind the walls, and she's Jewish, even looks a bit like Anne Frank. She's nineteen years old, plays a sixteen year old and has the cinematic experience of a thirty year old, since her acting debut at 12, another one to watch, like Roman Griffin Davis. Davis' character plays the reluctant young cadet in Hitler's army, one who doesn't belong and who's inspired to try anyway by an imaginary and funny Adolph Hitler only Jojo can see, an artistic license the movie required, but it worked for me.<br/><br/>I know some will not be able to take in the tragic elements for the funny bits and for others it will be the other way around, but for those patient enough to keep an open mind, you will not be disappointed; I was not, I was, as previously mentioned, moved. Taika Waititi, the writer director deserves kudos for that."

","JOJO RABBIT: I can only imagine the conversation: 'Here's an idea. Let's make a movie about the Hitler Youth in Germany during the latter stages of WWII, and put it all on the shoulders of an unknown 11 year old kid and put up 14 million dollars to do it.' Ya gotta be kidding, right? Well guess what folks. They did it and it's a delight. If you think 'Springtime for Hitler' from The Producers was funny, you'll love Jojo. Jojo is a 10 year old boy in the Hitler Youth who's imaginary friend is The F√ºhrer himself, played with delicious buffoonery by writer/director Taika Waititi. Scarlett Johanson is just wonderful as Jojo's mom and Thomasin McKenzie as the little Jewish girl who is hidden away in a secret room in their home is just delightful. Sam Rockwell is ridiculously funny as the H.Y. commander and is backed up beautifully by Rebel Wilson (whom I generally don't care for). Jojo's friend, Yorki is played by Archie Yates and is also outstanding. The dialogue is original and funny, the physical comedy hits the mark every time while the background story is poignant and sometimes sweet in a very honest and real way. The training scenes are hysterical. The direction, the dialogue, the sight gags are perfectly edited and the period production values are first rate. The kid who plays Jojo (Roman Griffin) is absolutely phenomenal: Has incredible range, cute as a button, spot on reactions, brilliant comic timing, so honest and believable, endearing and handles the pathos in a genuine way. I'd love to see the cast get the Ensemble SAG Award just so this kid could win. Not only that, he should get an Oscar nom for his performance because the kid carries the movie. Score: 9.5. GO!

"CabbageCustard","8","4","10","3 January 2020"," Bitter-sweet tale of a young boy letting go of his prejudices
","You have to hand it to Taika Waititi. It is a brave director who uses Adolf Hitler (albeit an imaginary one) and his Nazi sympathizers in a satire condemning war. There is so much potential for things to go wrong.<br/><br/>I had seen a review of this movie on TV and was under the impression that this was a laugh-a-minute comedy that would have me chuckling non-stop, in the vein of Waititi's earlier movie Hunt for the Wilder People. So, I was disappointed to realise early on that this was not nearly as humorous as I anticipated. It was certainly quirky and did make me smile, but there was not the broad vein of comedy that I expected. But then, completely unexpectedly and without me realizing it, this movie opened out and blossomed into a truly lovely story of a young boy confronting the prejudices that society had taught him, seeing them for the falsehoods they are and learning acceptance and love. It is poignant, it is clever, gently funny and it is effective. It isn't a movie about the folly of war after all, but about the folly of ignorance, discrimination, racism and prejudice.<br/><br/>The movie boasts a fine cast. Scarlett Johansson is a revelation as the title character's mother. Sam Rockwell is always good and he is good here. I didn't recognise Alfie Allen in his roll as Finkel but he is good too. Archie Yates is funny as JoJo's mate Yorki, Stephen Merchant is great in a brief role as the slimy and scary Gestapo officer. Rebel Wilson shows, as she has in many of her movies, that she can't act and isn't really very funny either. Taika Waititi himself takes on the role of the imaginary Adolf Hitler. I'm not sure if that was a good decision, but I can live with it. Thomasin McKenzie is lovely, fragile and powerful as Elsa. The highest praise though must go to Roman Griffin Davis in what I believe is his first movie. Where did they find him? He is absolutely brilliant in the title role of JoJo. He carries the movie and shines brightly even among the other luminaries in the cast. This kid can act. He is a natural comedian and gets the broad strokes and subtle nuances just right to make us believe and fall in love with little JoJo. I see a big future in store for this kid if he chooses to stay in the movie industry.<br/><br/>The reviewer I saw on TV labelled JoJo Rabbit one of the best movies of the year (2019). I think he was correct."
"alindsay-al","9","4","10","3 January 2020"," A Fantastic really funny film
","The first film I have seen in 2020 is Jojo Rabbit, a film that has been predicted to do incredibly well at the Oscars this year so I was intrigued to watch this film and I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. The premise of the movie sees a young Nazi trying to find his place when he comes across a Jewish Girl.<br/><br/>Main Character
Roman Griffith Davis is a young child actor and this is the first film I have seen him in but I don't think it will be the last in this film as he is truly fantastic in this film. His character Jojo goes through a really emotional journey throughout the film and you end up really caring about this character even though he is a Nazi. This is literally one of the best child performances in recent memory and I am curious how much recognition he will get and when we will see him next.<br/><br/>Supporting Characters
This film has a really impressive supporting cast and first to Taika Waititi who is also the Director of this movie, he plays Adolf Hitler in this film and is Davis's imaginery friend in the film. He is brilliant in this film and delivers a great over the top performance that provides some really funny moments in this film. He and Davis have really great chemistry in the film and really provide some stand out moments in the film. Scarlett Johansson plays Jojo's mother in the film and she also delivers a good performance, she plays the loving mother very well and you believe in her relationship with Jojo. Her character has a bit of mystery to it but that doesn't get enough time to fully invest you but she is a good character in this film. Thomasin Mckenzie plays the Jewish Girl in this film and her and Davis's chemistry is very good and their development is the emotional crux in the movie so in order for you to believe in this film you have to care about their story. Sam Rockwell, Alfie Allen & Rebel Wilson are also really funny in this film and give good performances.<br/><br/>Story
This film was pretty much marketed as a comedy so I was curious how the story was going to be but it was pretty good. As mentioned the relationship between Davis & Mckenzie's characters is the part that invested me and made me care about the these characters and the story that they go through in the film. However, I feel like the story wasn't as strong as it could have been, there are certain elements of the story involving other characters that don't get enough time for you to really care about them, and with the film being only around 1 Hour 40 Minutes there could have been time for this.<br/><br/>Script
This film does focus on the humourous side and does an excellent job. If you like darker humour this film is definitley for you. Waititi especially provides tons of laughs and after his performance as Korg in Thor Ragnarok, he truly is built for really funny supporting roles. The drama though is suprisngly very good, you really will care about these characters and the plight that they are in, especiallly as the film comes towards its conclusion.<br/><br/>Style
This film is a very funny film, it knows when to take itself seriously though and does a really good job of finding the balance between the two types of tone where it doesn't take away from each other. It deals with the subject matter in a really fun way and this film has a very unique feeling which gives it extra poimts in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall
This in my opinion is a fantastic film that really made me laugh and gave me a real fun time in the cinema. If you like films with dark humour this is a film for you and even if you aren't this film could be for you and you should give it a chance."

","An antidote to hate, prejudice & fearmongering that appears to be on the rise of lately, Jojo Rabbit takes a provocative subject matter, fills it up with heart, soul & compassion, and exquisitely juggles the hilarious with the serious to surprise us all as one of the most delightful, affectionate & endearing films of the year.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Taika Waititi (best known for What We Do In the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople & Thor: Ragnarok), the film is an audaciously handled satire that blatantly parodies everything Nazi, and attempts to capture the utter absurdity of such ideologies by illustrating it all from a 10-year old's perspective.<br/><br/>The lighthearted approach, simple-minded treatment & idiosyncratic characters inhabiting this black comedy do keep the fanciful tone alive n kicking but Waititi also makes sure that an undercurrent of seriousness is evident between the lines and the dramatic portions & dark moments do pack the required emotional punch.<br/><br/>Adding more richness to the story is the sincere inputs from both the young & veteran members of the cast, each playing their roles with emotional honesty. Waititi himself portrays the childish, parodic version of F√ºhrer, and is amusing throughout. The interactions between characters remain interesting, plus their arcs exhibit genuine depth.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Jojo Rabbit is a witty, whimsical & warm-hearted effort from Taika Waititi that finds the Kiwi filmmaker doing what he does best and is another impressive addition to his repertoire. A passionately crafted satire with its heart at the right place, Jojo Rabbit might not appease every palate but its arrival is by all means a welcome one. Highly recommended."

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","10","20 December 2019"," This motion picture is All Reich. I kinda like JoJo Rabbit.
","A satire black comedy about making fun of Nazis is always going to be funny in my book; despite some people feelings about uncomfortable laughing at the subject matter. After all, 1940 Charlie Chaplin's masterpiece 'The Great Dictator' is one of my favorite movies of all time. Since humor is subjective some people might still find this movie a bit unfunny regardless if it has Nazis or not. On the other hand I really doubt that peace loving musicians like the Beatles found it funny to see the German version of their pop songs be turned into a represented of fascist cult of personality culture. Maybe David Bowie, but who knows. Nevertheless director Taika Waititi still went down the rabbit hole and delivered a surreal surface level humorous look of what life was like for the citizens of Nazi Germany by telling the story of young Hitler Youth member, Johannes 'Jojo' Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) finding out his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. Without spoiling this coming to age journey based on author Christine Leunens's book 'Caging Skies' too much, Waititi indeed put a rabbit out of his hat and delivered an unexpected magic trip through World War 2 in a boyhood whimsy child's perspective. The screenplay also written by the director didn't felt as bleak and harden as the more adult like writing approach the source material had. The film's story felt more dream like. The movie is also beautifully shot. There were several lingering shots focus intently on the mother's distinctive shoes foreshadowing future events that was a really nice touch. It's just too bad that it's really hard to figure out the timeline of events were as historical accuracies was somewhat tossed out of the window. Honestly for a director who explicitly did zero research on Adolf Hitler, he was also fine in his acting as the make believe friend version of the dictator who eat unicorn and smokes too much. While the whole imaginary best friend was not in the source material. The scenes with him and JoJo were charming, but also somewhat disturbing when it has to be to overlook that. It wasn't as deliberately light hearted vapid silly and corny offensive as 1990 British sitcom 'Heil Honey! I'm Home' which was cancelled after one episode. The filmmaker did show how brutal his teachings can honest be with the rabbit killing allegory scene. Much in the same way Walt Disney 'Education for Death: the Making of the Nazi' cartoon did in 1943. Nor does the filmmaker shy away from the many crimes that the Nazis had competed. The powerful emotional hanging scene is one such example. The way it was shot with shot of the feet lying lifeless is haunting. Then there was the intense suspenseful sequence involving the Gestapo led by a sinister agent Deertz played by Stephen Merchant coming to the titular character's home for a visit. That was very creepy. The film also even challenge the concept of war with JoJo challenge his mother's lack of patriotism. That scene with the mother acting like the father with the soot and her not breaking character in order to apologize for yelling is really commanding. Scarlet Johannsson's acting really capture that moment even if her character didn't seem so traditional mother like. It's very emotional and heart breaking. You really do see JoJo start to question his beliefs after that. So begins a tense, complex, and at times hilarious series of exchanges between Elsa brilliant played by McKenzie & himself. Roman's acting is truly amazing for somebody that young. Glad they made JoJo somewhat likeable. The character here is a lot more sympatric than the source material version who kept Elsa a slave for years after the war because he couldn't cope with losing. Also glad that the filmmaker didn't make them hate each other in the end like the book due to the confusion of possession for love. That was too much of a downer. Regardless one thing I didn't really get was what they were going with his mentorship with Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). I felt like that subplot got lost. Don't get me wrong, Rockwell's acting is pretty good as the tired bitter injury ex- Wehrmacht soldier, but what was the endgame for him. One minute he seem like he is bad mouthing the party's policies during the war during a lecture at the youth camp and turning a blind eye in order to protect JoJo from the Gestapo, but in the end, he's still fighting for the party. I guess it can be said that his loyalty is with protecting Germany, not the Nazis but it's not really explore or explain. It's difficultly to find a read on that character. It's frustrating but not quite hopping mad. I also found Archie Yates portrayal as Yorki, Jojo's best friend very amusing. However I felt that the character didn't have much to do besides spill exposition and be comedy relief. In truth a more tragic ending for him could had been really powerful for the film; much in the same way Piggy met his end in William Golding's novel 'The Lord of the Flies' showing the end of childhood's innocence. Still the movie was push the envelope enough. It didn't really play it safe. Overall: It's a pretty good film. The flick's messages about acceptance and tolerance is just as needed now as it did in 1945. There is a lot to relate to today's modern society. In the end, it's a wonderful motion picture that needs to be seen. So hop onto it & check it out!"

","I honestly don't know what I was expecting from this movie. However, I left the cinema with much more than I thought I would.<br/><br/>This was the perfect balance of satire, comedy and a message that was loud and clear. We all fear what we don't know and hate is something we are taught.<br/><br/>I laughed so hard I felt it in my stomach. I shed a tear and I felt like I needed to dance.

"jg_1977","9","8","26","25 October 2019"," A stunningly crafted Nazi farce with a simple, yet powerful message
","The only fair way to judge a movie is by how well it lives up to own its aspirations, and in the case of Jojo Rabbit, it is a stellar success. Writer/director Taika Waititi tells the coming of age story of 10-year-old German boy, Johannes (Jojo), who is being brought up in the Hitler Youth during the final months of the second world war. When Jojo learns that his mother is harboring a jewish girl in their attic, he must confront his ideals and face the truth that Nazis are nothing, if not absurd. The manner in which Waititi handles the absurdity of the Nazis, both with his writing and his portrayal of an imaginary Adolf Hitler, is pure comedic genius. His approach works because he creates humor in both surface-level and subtle layers. As a comedy, completely divorced from its subject matter, Jojo Rabbit would still be riotously funny thanks to the physical comedy and all-star line deliveries from every cast member. And with the subtext of taking away power from Nazi propaganda and ideals, reducing them to cartoonish manifestations of a boys imagination, this film succeeds to an even greater degree. Jojo Rabbit never aspires to tell the harrowing truth of the Holocaust or to completely dismantle the Nazi ideology because from the perspective of a young boy learning to love rather than hate, those beats would be out of place. The film accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is prove that we can all change into a better person, simply by doing what we can. Although the comedy and heart of this film are the main attraction, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that from a purely technical and narrative perspective, Jojo Rabbit is equally fantastic. The film is gorgeously shot and edited, with some of the best visual storytelling I've seen this year. Waititi has thoroughly cemented himself as a contemporary master, and I can't wait to see where he goes from here. Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, heart-warming, and easily one of the best cinematic experiences of the year."

"EthelredBusybody","10","5","14","16 December 2019"," Black Comedy Plus Tragedy that I Want to Watch Again Soon!
","I seldom want to watch a movie again, without quite a bit of time passing between viewings. But after seeing this yesterday, I want to watch it again very, very soon. I loved every minute of it and I also missed quite a lot of the dialogue because the audience were laughing so much - two good reasons to see it again.<br/><br/>I would say that this is a ""black comedy"" with the quirky humour one has come to expect of Waititi, but there were also very sad and poignant moments, plus wonderful music taken from the soundtrack of my life (albeit the German versions).<br/><br/>I think all the actors gave wonderful performances but I was pleasantly surprised by Scarlett Johansson (Rosie, the mother). I thought she was better in this movie than in anything else I have seen her in. Roman Griffin Davis (JoJo) was also great. At times he seemed to try a German accent and didn't quite pull it off, but that was a minor peeve. As Archie Yates (Yorki) and others did, I reckon he could have just not bothered with the accent.<br/><br/>This review is going to be way too long if I say something about all the performances, so I will end off now by saying simply, ""Go see it for yourself!"""

"wire_","5","6","18","6 November 2019"," Jojo Rabbit (2019)
","Jojo Rabbit (2019)<br/><br/>This is a movie that seems controversial, because it takes a chance with an overt invocation of Nazi Germany in a sympathetic setting. On fact, this movie has nothing to do with Nazis, Hitler or history, other than because of that history, various signs and symbols are part of our world heritage.<br/><br/>It takes about 1/2 the movie to discover that it is going to take no chances beyond juxtaposing Leni Riefenstahl newsreel footage with the Beatles singing in German. It dispenses with this bold gambit in the opening few minutes, taking the idea nowhere. But forgive yourself for thinking it might try to develop the idea.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie milks caricatures related to Nazis. No it's not a big deal. It's a cartoon, true to the Thor: Ragnarok pedigree of its creator.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi just wants to make a movie about adolescent love and the fear everyone rightly has about being included or excluded in a society that makes no sense, maybe largely because a society steeped in American movies and television makes no sense.<br/><br/>A goofy marionette doll made up to be Hitler is the imaginary friend of Jojo, a 10 year old German Boy Scout, at the edge of puberty. Think Harvey the Wonder Rabbit. A cute caricature of Anne Frank becomes his girlfriend.<br/><br/>If you are not old enough to be averse to the exploitation of the Third Reich for comedic-tragic purposes--The Producers (1967), anyone--you will be charmed by a well-photographed and carefully designed set piece, most likely created by Wes Anderson's production team in their off-time when he's doing animated features.<br/><br/>Nothing happens except that two kids fall in love under the auspices of personal tragedy. The dynamics of this go unexplored. I think Waititi means well, though his insights don't range any farther than open admonishments to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with life in spite of its emotional vicissitudes. And with a perky cheerful vibe.<br/><br/>Does the world need an upbeat lozenge about the Holocaust? After seeing the re-release of Mr. Klein (1976) I didn't reject this wacky sojourn. It's well acted. Its talent is given little to do but they make the best of it. The relationships portrayed are simplistic and one-dimensional, but not tacky. It is full of oddly good cheer, somehow obliterating the sense of how dark, morbid and grey the human experience often can be. We all know what's gonna happen: Allied Americans are gonna kick some Nazi ass and parade around with the Red, White and Blue, then Trump is gonna be re-elected. Freedum: ""Learn it, love it, live it"" as some golf nerd played by Chevy Chase once told his caddy. ""da-da-da-da-da..."" (Putt) ""De-de-de-de-de...."" (Putt). That's as far as this goes; sinking close putts with one hand on the iron.<br/><br/>And I didn't really wish for anything else to happen. The kid, his mom, and Anne Frank are all super appealing people, Sam Rockwell is a crank with a heart-of-gold, and Hitler is a goofball, designed to be annoying.<br/><br/>I don't see any comparison of this with Life if Beautiful (1997). I like this better. But the Begnini movie had an odd irony, noted by cultural critic S. Zizek, that while we are supposed to be moved by Begnini's efforts to protect the spirit of the boy, convincing him that everything happening in the concentration camp is part of an elaborate rouse, the boy in fact knows that he's being duped but plays along to protect the feelings of his caretaker, just as children pretend to believe in Santa Clause to humor their parents and get presents. But this uncanny quality doesn't exist within the Begnini movie itself. It had to be observed from without. There's probably no such irony possible with Jojo Rabbit.<br/><br/>This is the boundary of the uncanny which Jojo Rabbit somehow steadfastly avoids, amounting to nothing more than an emotional device to remind us love hurts. ""It's like Ghost meets the Mabchurian Candidate, but it's got a heart... that's in the right spot."" You'll learn little except a couple of R. M. Rilke quotes.<br/><br/>Anybody who has ever been discriminated against--which is pretty much everybody who went to high-school--will identify with the vilification of the unwanted other. Why this has to be couched in the horror of WWII Germany, I have no idea, except that's all close to being forgotten because everyone who was there has passed. Yes, the legacy lives on. But what does this movie have to do with it?<br/><br/>Try looking up ""billy wilder death mills"" on Youtube to become connected to a bit of what the era of the Allied victory actually looked like. Then forget about Jojo Rabbit as having any bearing on history.<br/><br/>BTW--Jojo Rabbit gets his name in a manner directly lifted from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). Watch that movie and consider how the memory-hole of Hollywood plies the collective mind.<br/><br/>Enjoyable fare that's more empty than it seems, but is so darn heartfelt you may not mind. It was OK with me."

The cast is phenomenal, starring the young Roman Griffin Davis as the titular character and rounded up by comedic heavy-hitters like Taika Waiti, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson and Stephen Merchant. The visuals are colorful and interesting, while the editing and pacing is flawless. One of the best of 2019 for sure."

","Before Thor: Ragnarok, there was What We Do In The Shadows. A very funny and wonderfully written mockumentary following the lives of a group of vampires. Thor: Ragnarok was definitely the best Thor film and is one of the more entertaining additions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I know we would have quality and good humor from Taika Waititi's newest film and was hyped for it. A comedic take on Nazis and an imaginary Hitler? Count me in. I ended up liking this more than I thought I would especially in the third act.<br/><br/>The film is about a young German boy living in Nazi Germany. He talks to his imaginary friend, an eccentric Adolf Hitler and wants to learn how to become tougher. He discovers that his mother is actually anti-Nazi and is hiding a teenage Jewish girl in a secret wall of their house. Initially, Jojo (the main character) is resistant to her because of the Nazi philosophy he has been taught but soon he becomes compassionate towards her and even loves her. However, her livelihood is at stake especially at a time where the Gestapo actively search for hidden Jews.<br/><br/>I'd love to praise the performances in this film. I think all around there is excellence. Each character works in their dramatic and comedic element. The film is funny as I thought it would be. Waititi has proven to be excellent in penning humorous work. However, what shocked me most was the level of emotion and humanity that the film deals with, and its done so well. Its a tough line that the film has to balance itself on. Its subject matter involves the darkest time in human history and yet the film takes a comedic approach to it and to one of the vilest figures in history, Hitler. This is no easy task, but Waititi does it and brings the quality.<br/><br/>I liked this a lot more than I thought it would and felt like the relationship between Jojo and Elsa was just so beautiful. The humor is at times dark but always witty and I just found it to be a joy to laugh along with it. I'm glad I went out of my way to see this as I think its a memorable effort and one that I can't wait to look back on. Its a film that deals with balancing emotions and its just done well.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

I am pleasantly shocked at how good this film is because in all honesty the trailers got me slightly worried, for some bizarre reason.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi is an absolute genius !! There is no other word I can describe him because this film has been made so brilliantly. The stakes are so high for this film to fail miserably, and maybe become almost offensively bad. Before seeing the final product the idea of a Nazi comedy doesn't feel you with confidence because if its not handled properly it end up almost making light of what happened in the war and of the Nazi's themselves. However this film and Waititi in particular have managed to perfectly balance comedy with drama. There are some hilarious laugh out loud moments in this film, mainly due to making fun out of the Nazi's and there ridiculous conspiracy theories. Its using all the hate and turning in into comedy.......such a genius move and it works amazingly well. All this surprising comedy is balanced with some great stomach punching drama, that will leave you breathless. Some fantastic twists.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast that this film has is also incredible, everyone is great in the film. Roman Griffin Davis is going to have a career ahead of him........carries the film so well, truly impressive. Scarlett Johansson is a proven great already, but she once again is amazing.....involved in some funny scenes. Sam Rockwell, can the man do any wrong....not in my opinion. Shoutouts to Thomasin McKenzie and Stephen Merchant both them great as well. Maybe some Oscar nods within this cast??????<br/><br/>Overall the film is a surprising joy to watch considering the subject matter, who knew it could create such great comedy. 90% out of 100 or 9 out of 10, its almost perfect there is a part in the middle of the film the just wanders around a bit.

","The Pianist and The Schindler's List are two of my favorite movies so that's why I watched Jojo too.
First, the movie is risky, dramatic, funny and intense. I love it. The script is pretty well developed and the cinematography is top.
Second, main character's acting is superb. A masterclass. I really enjoyed all the scenes with Hitler.
Last, sound editing and music are great too. Pretty good choices and amazing tracks. The ending scene is my favorite.
So, overall a fantastic movie to watch close to other masterpieces like The Pianist and Schindler's List."

","This film is fresh, funny, and yet extremely moving. Few films endeavor to touch the entire spectrum of human emotion. This film succeeds in moving its audience from roaring laughter to bitter tears; from whimsy to edge-of-your-sear-suspense.
All performances are noteworthy but Scarlett stands out as the mother ""who stares tigers in the eye."" She plays the role with such conviction and ferocity. She brings to life such a realistic depiction of a woman caught in a war she hates, that's torn her family apart. Every single scene she is in, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

"karlconga","5","2","4","25 February 2020"," Well intended, but ultimately shallow and unengaging
","Taika Waititi is no Wes Anderson.<br/><br/>I'm not even a huge fan of Anderson's, but he certainly can make a visually stunning (hence entertaining) movie without much of a story, or rather...with a story that can be summarized in a few sentences. But the result is still lovable for it's quirkiness.<br/><br/>I guess this is what Waititi was shooting for. He missed by a huge margin. It's not the lack of visually interesting scenes (thought still not in the same league with Anderson). It's the general topic, that makes the lack of story feel very off. It's a setting that shouldn't allow for such a void.<br/><br/>Pretty much every of the characters feel unbelievable or at least underdeveloped. I understand this is a comedy, but good comedies required especially good writing.<br/><br/>War is depicted as abstract, with little impact on every day life (in terms of conveniences). Everything is pretty much just talk until the last act and everybody seems well off.<br/><br/>Apart from the last act, not much happens in terms of a plot.<br/><br/>I don't see this movie as potentially offensive in any way, because it doesn't really dare an unpleasant perspective. Nazis are always depicted as idiots or caricatures. Everybody is a victim of the circumstances.<br/><br/>The message seemed especially odd to me. Where you would expect it to take either the road to moralize heavily, or point out that good or bad are hardly ever cut clearly, the movie appears to say: ""Good or bad are a part of life anyway. Don't bother.""<br/><br/>I beg to differ."

","Adolf: (to Jojo) Let me give you some really good advice. Be the rabbit. The humble bunny can outwit all of his enemies. He's brave, and sneaky, and strong. Be the rabbit.<br/><br/>Honestly, I wasn't sure if it would work, but it does. Jojo Rabbit is the quintessential Taika Waititi film, and creates this phenomenal narrative for us. Give this film to any, literally any other director, and it could not work. Jojo Rabbit handles some seriously heavy and touchy topics very well, and actually keeps the usual overkill of politics at bay.<br/><br/>Outstanding performances were delivered from Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant (side note, google this guy and note that a carbon copy of a bearded Cillian Murphy), obviously Taika Waititi himself. And seriously, this film brought out 3 unknown actors & actresses, and showed us that you don't need to be a well-known actor to steal the show. Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKensie, and Archie Yates are absolute gems, and truly bring this film to light. You will see those names a hell of a lot more in the future, I promise that.<br/><br/>This is such an interesting story, and has such wit and humor, even in a dark time period. Particularly, Jojo Rabbit maintains a surprising sense of respect and honor for the actual historical events that it represents. Jojo Rabbit definitely deserved that Oscar (a first). I believe this film has solidified Taika's status as a director to reckon with, so keep an eye out for this ingenious and witty director's upcoming films.<br/><br/>""Pat's Rotten Tomatoes"": 84%

"watchitwombat","Null","2","4","8 February 2020"," Something Special
","So-hot-right-now comedy wunderkind Taikia waititi jumps straight in the deep end with ""JoJo Rabbit"", about a young boy who wants to join the German army at the tail end of World War 2. Terrible timing aside, after an accident at his Hitler youth summer camp, JoJo discovers his mother is secretly harbouring a young Jewish girl, as the allies advance. What will Jojo do? And would you react if your imaginary best friend was Adolf Hitler?<br/><br/>A comedy like this requires a delicate balance - sympathy for young German soldiers, nazi tropes about Jews played for laughs, a few emotional deaths to remind us of the horrors of the situation.. there's a reason there's very few successful war comedies told from the losing side. Thankfully Taikia is skillful enough to keep it all moving, emotional where required and above all, keep it all funny.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen stand out as the debauched youth camp leaders who can see the writing on the wall, as does Archie Yates, the best example of a 10 year old boy playing a 50 year old British man playing a 10 year old boy, ever. Newcomer Roman Griffin Davis is fine as JoJo, and Scarlett Johansson is above her average performance as JoJo's mother.
JoJo doesn't always blend comedy and emotion as smoothly as it could, but that's nitpicking really - this is a brilliant concept that's right up Taikias alley. While a plot description might give some pause, don't think twice, this is really something special - a funny, original movie that may even get us to see things in a different light.

"RhapsodyReviews","4","2","4","3 February 2020"," Unpopular Opinion.
","Review:
'Jojo Rabbit' is a comedy-drama film directed by Taika Waititi, It is based on Christine Leunens's book 'Caging Skies'.
I was excited to watch this movie once I heard it was a comedy that was nominated for Best Picture and written and directed by Taika Waititi. I was very disappointed as I was watching it and by the time it was over, I was actually upset about what I seen.
Roman Griffin Davis portrays the title character, Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler, a Hitler Youth member who finds out his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. He must then question his beliefs, while dealing with the intervention of his imaginary friend, a fanciful version of Adolf Hitler (Waititi).
Starting off with the acting, it was pretty good. I'm glad Scarlett Johansson got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress; she was really good in the film. There is a lot of talk about how good Roman Griffin Davis was in film, but I didn't really find he was that great. Sure, he did a good job keeping up with the adult actors, but it wasn't anything special. I especially liked Sam Rockwell as the general who was training the kids to be Nozi soldiers.
It may just be the fact that this movie just wasn't for me, and that may well be the case given the great reviews it was been getting. I didn't laugh during the film and I found the overall story to be a little confusing. I know Taika Waititi is a director who like to do things out of the ordinary and I respect that type of film making a lot. This one just didn't hit me the way I was expecting.
Overall, it may just be the fact that I personally didn't like the film. If you like movies that take a heart-breaking situation and puts an outrageous spin on it, check this one out for sure. I can't see myself revisiting it, so I can't personally recommend it.
2/5"

","One of the most horrific times in modern history through the innocent eyes of a child is pure genius.

"ReelVillain","10","2","4","4 January 2020"," Hitler.... Youth's....
","In England after the hyper madness which is Christmas comes the depressing month that is January and with it follow all the Oscar bait movies from America most of which are drama's and frequently in themselves depressing. Lucky for us this year Taika Waitit has thrown his name into the Oscar hat bringing out a comedy about the Hitler Youth... That doesn't sound like a comedy at all, leave it to the man behind the greatest Thor film ever (which is somewhat damming with faint praise) to find the balance between The Boy In Striped Pajamas and the play The Producers were trying to make.... So the reel question does this man Mine Kampf for Waititi?<br/><br/>Taika is a unique writer, he seems to have an ability in finding whit in the most obscure places, take What We Do In The Shadows for example, there have been countless movies spoofing and mocking the legend of Dracula and Vampires in general but few take the unique perspective of Taika. He is a man without compare, this is where we find Jojo Rabbit a film more about love and hope than an imaginary friend.<br/><br/>The challenge that Jojo Rabbit faces before it even begins is how funny can it be before it loses meaning? It's simple to mock the Nazis it's complicated to do so in a way that will keep the gravity of war in mind and ultimate pathos for the film, here is where Waititi shows his true genius. Jojo Rabbit while seemingly easy-going is just methodical in pacing all buildings for the ultimate sucker punch. Which I'm not ashamed to say brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit has tension without ever being too serious. This is where Taika comes into his own, he uses Hitler as the joke, then add in that Taika plays the leader of the 3rd Reich personally and you have a recipe for success.<br/><br/>I cannot stress to you enough the power which Jojo Rabbit holds inside itself, this a is a movie far closer to Shindler's List than The Great Dictator, is it bold, unique and truly beautiful. Some of the simplest sequences are the most graceful; there is just something about watching Jojo ride his bike along a country road with his mum that I could happily watch for hours.<br/><br/>It would be stating the obvious to say that all the actors bring some of their most talented work to Jojo, so instead, I will speak about the headline character himself... Jojo. Roman Griffin Davis has a long and bright career in front of him, he can use abilities it takes actors decades to master already. Simple outstanding.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is proof that Waititi isn't just the future of the film industry but the right now too. Jojo is a beautiful blend of both hilarity and heartbreak. Hail Waititi!<br/><br/>10 Mind Reading Jews out of 10"

Jojo Rabbit is not a deep, clever or especially edgy film, GOOD! I don't suppose it was meant to be.
Simple will trump everything in my opinion when it comes to getting a message across, it's called the art of storytelling. It will do so, shock horror, because most people have more than enough complexity in their life without adding to it. They go to films or watch TV to be entertained, when oh when will these egotists work that out.
Jojo rabbit does that and yet still manages quite well enough to get its core message across. It shows the absurdity of totalitarian regimes through the eyes of children, who are nature's finest critics.
There is nothing wrong with deep, edgy and meaningful, it has its place. However being so doesn't make it superior, unless of course feeling superior is your aim!
I loved this film, wasn't what I expected. The performances of the two young boys alone should make it worth two hours of anyone's time. Despite a few unpleasant scenes it was also family friendly, not bad for a film about the horrors of Nazism.
Cheer up though lads, I'm sure some incomprehensible Euro dirge will be along soon enough and then you can feel all intellectually masterful again."

","Taika Waititi is slowly becoming one of my favourite directors working today, and Jojo Rabbit is possibly my favourite film that he has ever made. It's between this and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, but I'll be rewatching that film soon to get my definitive favourite. Thor Ragnarok is also incredibly fun, and What We Do in the Shadows is hilarious.<br/><br/>The acting in Jojo Rabbit is great. Taika Waititi plays the imaginary Hitler, and he is joined by extremely talented actors, such as Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, Alfie Allen, and Thomasin McKenzie. However, the star of the film is definitely Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, and the on-screen relationship he shares with Yorki is extremely touching.<br/><br/>I was very happy that Waititi won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, because the script managed to be witty and heartfelt at the same time. One second I was laughing hysterically, and the next second my heart felt as if it had been ripped from my chest.<br/><br/>The characters are also really well developed, and it was nice seeing the war through the eyes of a ten-year old boy. It's a very unique approach, and Waititi adds his one-of-a-kind style to it. The characters also have a definitive arc throughout the film, which was nice because we were able to see a na√É¬Øve Jojo transform into someone who realises that maybe the German war and Hitler aren't all they're cracked up to be.<br/><br/>I do think that the third act is a little weaker than the first two, but it's still great and contains some amazing moments. It also didn't do anything to knock my socks off, but it didn't really need to and those are minor nit-picks in an otherwise fantastic film. Jojo Rabbit is, without a doubt, a strong recommendation.<br/><br/>SCORE: 88%"

Jojo has a great narrative arc, he evolves a lot throughout the movie, especially after the death of his mother, but also through his complex relationship with Elsa. Sometimes he has a great difficulty to guess if he is feeling loved or friendship towards her, it really portrays the bunch of emotions that a young adolescent like him could go through.<br/><br/>Of course, Taika Waititi is an excellent director that has the talent to capture comic scenes in his movie and to write interesting and likable characters.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie is probably not as historically accurate as you would like and can be very divisive due to his type of humor, but give it a try."

","A boy who has been brainwashed since he was a child accidentally finds that the whole world is a lie. The Jews stood in front of the secret police, who could not recognize them. At that moment, he had doubts about everything around him. Perhaps the Nazis he fanatically followed were not the embodiment of justice. Perhaps the evil twisted Jews in people's mouth were no different from others. However, the most difficult thing is not to be kept in the dark, but to choose after knowing the truth. You can drift with the current and pretend nothing has happened, or you can go against the current and fight against the darkness to the end. Just as mother and Capt. christendo kept sober in the current of the times and did not lose themselves. A minute of heat, a minute of light, makes the firefly general, but also a little light in the dark, do not have to wait for the torch. He finally awakened to his self-consciousness, took over the baton of responsibility and responsibility from his predecessors, waved goodbye to his past self and threw himself into the arms of freedom.

","""And it is up to you to decide if you want to be remembered, or disappear without a trace, like a pitiful grain of sand into a desert of insignificance. To put it plainly. Get your s**t together and sort out your priorities."" √∞≈∏¬¶‚Äπ<br/><br/>Who else but Hollywood's self-proclaimed ""Polynesian Jew"" to blend such an audacious concept, serious subject matter and whimsical nature into a rousing Academy Award winning-success? Carefully balancing cutting satire with a sentimental coming-of-age story, the WWII fairy tale is sharp, quirky and pulls few punches, taking audiences from fits of uncontrollable laughter to tear-jerking sequences and everything in between. Making a mockery of the Nazis in 2019 is still a bold decision, and frightening when compared to contemporary politics, plus several jarring tonal shifts can catch unsuspecting viewers off-guard, so be sure to have a tissue or two handy. At the film's heart is its stellar cast and gorgeous production design, injecting every scene with playful exchanges and a light-hearted tone, like our leading couple and future stars Roman Griffin Davis and Thomas McKenzie, heavy hitters Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson, but best of all is the scene-stealing Archie Yates, who's sure to have a place in the on-screen Hitler Youth hall of fame."

","Synopsis : Looking like 1945, in the last stages of world war II, 'Jojo Betzler' a ten year old kid joins the Deutsches( German) Jungvolk.

In the middle stage of the movie, we see that Jojo discovers that his single mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their attic.Aided only by his imaginary friend--Adolf Hitler--Jojo must confront his blind nationalism as world war II continues to rage on. Though, Child Jojo continues to speak that girl, doing his best to uncover her ""Jew secrets"".

Last stage, the war just ended up,with brutal state.Germans are not be outdone.They fought with their lives. There is a big point , writer wants to say that, Peace is very important , Love is very important.
A marvelous comedy-drama film by the master,oscar awarded director, Taika Waititi, based on Christine Leunen's book 'Caging Skies' with his finest team. The film is amazing in all aspects like acting,music,dialogue. If you like historical drama or like anything, you will love this without question."

","While the main character of this film is ten years old, it is not a movie for children, being more in the tradition of Robert Benigni's 1997 film Life is Beautiful. The title character, Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffith Davis) is a member of the Hitler Youth in a small town in 1944 Germany, but he is a miserable little Nazi. He earned his nickname when he refused to kill a rabbit during a training exercise and really screws up during grenade practice, being too close when the device goes off. He survives, but his face is scarred. He doesn't have friends, except for fat little Yorki (Archie Yates), so he conjures up an imaginary friend in the form of Adolt Hitler (Waiki Waititi, who also directed and wrote the screenplay). Then he finds that his mother (Scarlett Johansson, nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) is hiding a 15 year old Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house. The local members of the Hitler Youth are commanded by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who lost an eye during combat earlier in the war, and he is assisted by Alfie Allen and Rebel Wilson, but they are essentially caricatures rather than characters. (Wilson's character even claims to have given birth to 18 blonde Aryans like herself.) The local head of the Gestapo, played by Stephen Merchant, reminded me of one of the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens, the script by Waititi won the Oscar in the Best Adapted Screenplay category. Despite the subject matter, the film's purpose is satirical and it is actually quite funny at times. While it offers no new insights into the Nazis and is not all that original (Charlie Chaplin made The Great Dictator in 1940 and Mel Brooks The Producers in 1967), it is timely because of the recent rise of Anti-Semitism."

","The film is very well acted. I liked even the little kid. I didn't read anything about the movie and I kind of expected to be a contemporary film about a child with Hitler as an imaginary friend, but no, it's a WWII movie, seen from the perspective of a child. I would put it in the same category as La vita √É¬® bella, but not as good. Sam Rockwell's character was great.<br/><br/>The only problem with the film, I believe, is that it quickly became predictable. The imaginary Hitler had no real impact on the story, while the characters quickly fell into familiar cliches: the innocent child, the beautiful Jew, the happy, beautiful, artistic and intelligent parent who makes said child's life wonderful even in the midst of war, the tragic hero, the cardboard evil Nazis. I would have loved a movie about a contemporary American child with Hitler as his imaginary friend, getting him in trouble, but you need balls to do that.<br/><br/>As for people who felt ""offended"", it's a classic Nazis are bad story. I am still waiting for a true dramatic story of actual Nazis who are also human, without the need for saving Jews. That would be even less offensive, mind you, but you wouldn't get it."

","I was slightly skeptical about this film. Another movie about Nazis? Another comedic take on the Holocaust? (By the Thor Ragnarok guy?) We have been here and done that, after all. But I was wrong. This movie was about Nazis to a certain extent, but it was more about what it means to be born and raised within a worldview only to realize something's off. Jojo's journey starts when he meets someone who defies his expectations and causes him to question everything. I would argue that's where most journeys start. And this film managed to capture that while also making the audience laugh and think and feel tense all at once. It was a historical film that transcended its genre and time period. Sometimes revisiting the familiar allows you to find something entirely new...and worthwhile."
"cgcastanedo-75966","7","0","0","6 April 2020"," ""Awareness""
","Through the naive gaze of a 10-year-old boy, Taika Waititi tells us the key moment of ""Awareness"" of a society that has been suffering the consequences with pain for years, for having given their unconditional support to a leader, who is on the verge of debacle, through an interesting story located in Germany at the end of World War II.
Film that shows how influential society is due to age, socioeconomic status or ignorance and how easy it is to be able to manipulate it. Which points out the tricky methods of induction and promotion, through false nationalism, of exalting self-pride, of promising even the impossible, of making you see yourself as the Messiah, of idealizing yourself as the Savior of your people: Populism.
The New Zealand director makes it clear in Jojo Rabbit that the way to open your eyes, 'kick' the false illusion and realize reality, is through love and not hate. Accept us all as we are, regardless of physical conditions, races or religions.
In a burlesque and repetitive way, the author offers a couple of scenes, underlining the ridiculousness of the greeting to his leader, extolling praise, total dedication and unquestioning submission to him.
Comedy with a satirical tone, which although it has some good ideas, does not manage to go beyond the anecdotal level of the plot in order to turn it into a great film.
The ideas: In a movie that is located in a time of war, it is a very good idea to start with:
""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" by The Beatles to set the tone for the film's parody. It's also a great idea, concluding with ""Heroes"" by David Bowie rounding out the message of the film, with phrases from the song: ""We Can Be Heroes, Just For One Day""
Bad idea: using slow motion, trying without success, to give a poetic touch to a satirical-political comedy. Performances include: Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell"

","Waititi perfects the balance between making you laugh one moment and cry the next, or both simultaneously. Understandably, a movie about Nazis and the Holocaust is going to divide critics.

"arungeorge13","7","0","0","6 April 2020"," Neat work from Waititi and his cast/crew! [+69%]
","Irreverent humor (and/or satire) is a difficult genre to crack, but Waititi once again shows he can completely own his script and get the best out of his performers. To be honest, I didn't particularly find the first 30-40 minutes to be that amusing, but as the second act commenced, it started growing on me. The film beautifully portrays the warm, funny, and morose relationships between Jojo (a fantastic Roman Griffin Davis, who brings adorable 10-year-old-isms to the table with a dash of harmless, satirical fanaticism for Hitler) and a bunch of people around him - his bestie Yorki (Archie Yates, who has got great timing in humor), his mother Rosie (a wonderful-as-always Scarlett Johansson), and his new Jewish acquaintance Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie, who's wildly effective), to name a few.<br/><br/>There's also his imaginary best friend Adolf Hitler (played by Waititi himself, getting the funniest lines) and Captain Klenzendorf (a bubbly Sam Rockwell) playing important roles. As I said, once you've okayed yourself with the nature of the film's irreverence, you're in for a joy ride. The second half features a particularly hysterical scene with Stephen Merchant making a cameo. To add to that, I need to give kudos to Waititi for transitioning between hilarious and heartbreaking in a matter of seconds, in one specific scene (cannot spoil it!) so brilliantly. I cannot remember the last time a shot of a woman's feet was used to convey something so intense and powerful.<br/><br/>Jojo's transformation from a 'Heil Hitler'-ing fanatic to a boy fluttering with dreams, hopes, and humanity, has been written and performed in a very believable manner. In terms of wackiness, I'd give Rebel Wilson's character an extra point. Every time she showed up, hilarity ensued. Jojo Rabbit may be set in trying times, but it is a feel-good watch indeed, ably supported by its classy production design, pleasing soundtrack, and a lot of benevolence (a.k.a tying each other's shoelaces)."

Roman Davis in his 1st role is stunning, and the rest of the cast are equally as good.

","Directed by Taika Waititi. Starring Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell, Archie Yates, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, Luke Brandon Field, Sam Haygarth. (R)<br/><br/>In the waning days of the war, young Johannes (Davis) dreams of becoming a Nazi and serving the Fatherland--he even has Adolf Hitler (Waititi) as an imaginary friend--but he begins to have doubts after discovering a Jewish girl (McKenzie) hiding in his attic and realizing that's she's nothing like the despicable stereotypes he'd been taught about her people. Writer/director Waititi's idiosyncratic Nazi comedy is more ""daring"" than ""brave,"" the distinction being that he's willing to push boundaries for a nervous-but-genuine laugh, yet he still mostly stays in safe territory by not addressing the ugliest truths, and only directly dealing with darkness when plumbing for sentiment or sadness--less the black comedy or satire it appears to be on the surface than an irreverent lampoon with a reassuring heart. The whimsical nature of the humor does, however, successfully capture the absurdity of war and the ignorance of evil, and the film rarely falls short on the task of being entertaining and/or touching. Smart casting invigorates the material, even if Rockwell could do this sort of role in his sleep by now and McKenzie's youth-in-hiding is more of an emblem or prop than fully-realized character.

"Deux_Vega","8","0","0","20 March 2020"," I was a little sceptical ...but ... i was wrong.
","After seeing the trailer i wasn't sure this would be a movie that I'd appreciate. It's quite a heavy subject that's hardly suitable to be put into a comedic perspective. Just, don't do it! It's so easy to screw this up, so yes, i was quite sceptical and actually planning not to watch it. But my wife was really curious, and this guy also made ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" ... so after some debating we decided to give it a go.
After 5 minutes it already became clear that it wasn't what i thought. I won't go into the details to prevent spoilers, but it turned out rather charming and mostly from a point of view of the 10 year old main character, JoJo, which puts everything in the right perspective.
There's a dip somewhere halfway where things start to get a little stale, but that quickly turns into a interesting and captivating finale.
No, it's definitely not as heavy, deep and captivating as Schindler's List or The Pianist, and for sure will rub on some people the wrong way considering the light-hearted and comedic nature. But there's definitely a more deep and moving storyline that i find charming and reminded me somewhat of Pan's labyrinth.
WO2 was nothing like what this movie is portraying. But it's also not ignoring it. It just shows it from the naive view of a 10 year old. Not sure what's so wrong about that. Especially since it's absurdism is so obvious. It's not trying to kick people against the knees.
Still, maybe Waititi shouldn't have picked this subject, because it's on one hand a little cheap to pick one of the biggest horrors in history as contrast for your jokes, but on the other hand, it's working because of the horrors of the subject.
For me it's way more interesting and less offensive as the mainstream pulp like the 101 brainless superhero movies that comes from Hollywood.
Keep going Waititi, i've been a fan since ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and will look forward to your next flick."

","""The Joker's Whimsical World"" unveiled the real world wrapped in icing with a brisk and smooth rhythm, turning the boy's growth story from blind obedience to questioning into a warm and sad war fairy tale. I can fully feel it. The director tries to tell through the film the loss and gain, pain and joy, imitation and courage that may be experienced in the growth process, and amplify the nature of love and hope in life. Personally, I have recently seen many movies that describe children entering the adult world, but only ""The Joker's Whimsical World"" can make such a huge contrast without any child inappropriate lens, which is quite strong. Resonance and reflection space.I like ""The Young Man's Whimsical World"" to bring out the ruthless wars of the Second World War era through the characters' views and mood changes, and the contrast highlights the warmth and preciousness of emotions between family and family. The whole movie is full of emotions, not only playing the role of the director of the boy 's imaginary father Hitler, Taiga Viditi, but also the supporting roles of Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell. The audience saw that even in the most cruel times, there are many things that we should cherish. Just as the Jews are no different from us, the children in Nazi Germany are also so naive."

","With a child's perspective, the film reinterprets the ideology of war and power, reaffirming a universal value that is not new, but one that needs to be emphasized in particular today: that gratuitously hatred is rooted in ignorance, and that when we let go of our prejudices, we find ourselves as human beings. Jews don't have horns. German children are just children."

","Tenderly sweet, at times charming, but ultimately falling to find its own footing; Jojo Rabbit may not be the potential filled dream that it could have been, but is certainly an enertating work that is certainly unique and surprisingly colorful. To start, the acting in the film is fairly impressive for the majority of the performances throughout. Scarlett Johansson truly gives a fantastic job playing the part of Jojo's mother Rosie Betzler. Sam Rockwell also gives quite a memorable performance as Captain Klenzendorf, and both make for some extremely well executed, humourous, and heartfelt moments throughout. The cinematography is stunning, and most likely my favorite part about the film. Taika decided to not shy away from the beauty of Germany at the time, which was so often ignored in other WWII films, and is heavily spotlighted throughout. It's a true joy to see, but unfortunately, Jojo Rabbit is not always a joy to watch. Often enough, the humor throughout the film seems to fall flat. With jokes not only seeming lazily written, but also quite awkward and poorly executed. Some of the humorous moments throughout also just seemed to dragged out, or simply tiresome from oh so many viewings before. The film can be entertaining to a point, but does have a bit of a pacing issue, and a bit trouble finding its footing with its story as well. It's a bit sad how little things like this, if fixed, could make the movie clearly so much better, but sadly it is not to be. In the end though, Jojo Rabbit is more than enough of an enjoyable time, that will leave a smile on your face as the credits role, even with its fair share of flaws before.

","I know it's not OK to compare, especially if films were done with such a time distance, in completely different geographies (think local vs. global), for different audiences. Anyway, Eagle vs Shark remains one of the most lovely, original, endlessly funny films for me, and because of that film I was following Taika's career development for more than 10 years. I am sad that with his big career, he's lost his valuable sources that fed his true creativity, quirkiness, weirdness that actually brought him to this place. And probably, that's not all he's lost. I am sure he also misses himself, in his private 1 on 1 moments, and it must be a tough realisation. Hmm, making films as you want them, with smaller crews, a lot of friends and family who keep on inspiring you throughout the process vs. giving yourself into the machine that feeds you fame and money, but gives you tasteless, plastic ingredients for your dish. It can look as your signature project, but the taste... Takes some magic, and this guy's lost it.
I expected more from Thor, too, but I understood that the creative ""influence"" he could have there must have been minimal. So, I was hoping to see more in Jojo. Was so happy he got nominated for Oscars, without even seeing the film. Oh, boy. (Remember Boy? So lovely. ) Can't imagine how awesome this film could have been if it was made by original Taika, unposessed by the living ghost of Hollywood's emptiness. It's sad how many talents sell their soul for immortality within the machine while they need to die as authors as soon as they get inside. But maybe, that's also an easy way out. To remain big for real, it takes more than ego.
Jojo? Nice concept. Cute Hitler. Watching it... Boring and dull. Charmless. Messy. Scarlett... Such a bad casting. No character in any character. Nothing. Even the illustration scrapbook doesn't have character. Music? Must be an awesome novelty for the Hollywood films audience. Sorry but also, addtheprefix-exploitation. Huge luck to get so far with this mediocre film.

","Jojo Rabbit tries to introduce the scenes in a funny way but it's not comedy at all, after going 1 hour into the movie the last 30 minutes of the movie was the time i knew i liked the movie, at first it tries to be funny but then the events change to sadness, so here is the question would it have been better if the comedy was excluded? I can say yes if it was going on the drama line the story would been more emotional and sadness that would been more effective on our feelings what if no staying on what it is i appreciate how good it is but comedy is not there, The three main characters good job the kid Jojo (Roman Griffin) easily goes into our heart the girl Elsa (Thomasin Mckenzie) proofs her worthy and the mom Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) needs to drop more on drama genre and all others were greatly appreciated, the movie can keep you alive with it's colourful and great setup, the ending of it liked it after the character growth was done from first to last,

"hmgascoyne","10","0","0","1 March 2020"," Jojo Rabbit - A Satirical Love Story Between A Nazi Fanatic & A Jew
","I'm sure you look at the title of my review and think - did this guy get the wrong end of the stick while watching this? I say with full confidence that this movie is a masterpiece of satire, romance and drama.<br/><br/>So where to begin? The characters crafted by director Taika Waititi, who both directs and stars in this feature, also know for his work with ""what we do in the shadows,"" are truly multidimensional and have many angle to be viewed and interpreted even with some of the more minor roles having a complex background with the exception to some. This is best seen with the character of Jojo, played by Roman Davis, who is our lead and shows development throughout, he moves from avid Hitler fanatic, who imagines Hitler to be his best friend to a sympathiser of Jews who protects his new friend hiding from persecution at all costs. Other noteable examples include: Elsa, played by Thomasin McKenzie, acting perfectly and masterfully as the Jew hiding from persecution showing development as she opens up to the character Jojo and also telling him of her backstory. Scarlett Johansson's Rosie, anti-nazi mother struggling to raise her child without the state's influence, Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf who becomes dis-infatuated with his cause and spoiler: sacrifices himself to save Jojo by the end of the movie, Taika Waititi's portrayal of Cowardly Hitler desperate for the admiration of Jojo. All the characters listed have depth and do show comedic elements throughout.<br/><br/>Plot - the plot is simple Jojo is a member of the Hitler youth who has an imaginary friend: Hitler, he injuries himself with a grenade and is sent home. After he returns home he find that his mother is against the war and keeping a Jew in the walls of their home, he befriends the girl, Elsa, and he develops as a character.
-spoilers for remainder of plot -
The Gestapo visit his house and search it, for what we are not completely sure, Elsa comes out of hiding and poses as Jojo's sister Inga, who had died, she barely passes as his sister. Later Jojo goes out and finds that his mother has been hanged for distributing propaganda for the allies against the Germans. Jojo returns home and attempts to kill Elsa but ultimately fails. Soon thereafter the war comes to his town and the Americans and Soviets take the town. Jojo is rounded up with the other Nazis due to him earring the cap and jacket, the Captain, Klenzendorf, saves Jojo by taking the uniform from him and berating him as a Jew. As to get him kicked out of the line up where the Soviets executed Germans. He is promptly shot after this. Jojo returns home shortly after this to lie to Elsa about who won the war and after reviewing his book, ""yoo-hoo Jude,"" he realises that he has to let her go. He confesses his love for her and walks her outside after kicking Hitler out of a window. They proceed to dance in the streets to a German rendition of Bowie's Heroes.<br/><br/>So the plot... Surprisingly good, when written down it seems far too complex so I had to simplify a bit but not too simple. With the characters and comedy the plot is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I must now admit the title is misleading, the satire is completely true as the nature of the comedy is that of a satire but it is a story not of love in the sense of romance unless you count Jojo's unrequited love with Elsa but rather the brotherly and sisterly love developed throughout as Jojo begins to see Jews as people and not monsters and as Elsa realises that he is not a Nazi but a brainwashed child, infatuated with a cause.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the movie is tremendous and the camera shots are magnificent using close-ups, establishing shots and push/pull shots with horror like scenes. The soundtrack is composed with mostly German covers of famous songs.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Jojo Rabbit is a masterpiece of a movie that I would recommend to fans of satire and comedy as a whole. 10/10"
"andrewburgereviews","6","0","0","25 February 2020"," The shtick doesn't hold up
","I am really struggling to understand just where director/writer Taika Waititi was going with this movie. It is obviously anti-hate, anti-racism--duh, but its bursty pace makes any idea it might try to present lost up in the air. He got the people, he supposedly got the vision and know, he has kinda executed it.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the final days of World War II--the point where the German people have realized the insanity of Hitler's ridiculous delusions of grandeur. They know their end is approaching but they also know the realization they came to, they came to it too late. Few men are still carrying the indoctrination in their head. Among them, 9-year old boy Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), whose grasp on politics is, obviously, benign. His ""hatred"" towards Jews is summed up in fantastical elements, the regime infecting the young kids' minds by telling them stuff like the Jews have horns and the Devil controls their minds. Kids fell easy to fascination, but it got me thinking, in 1939, an entire nation did too. So, of course, when Jojo finds out his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) inside their home, he gets jumpy.<br/><br/>Elsa sees him for the innocent and corrupted-minded boy he is and, eventually, the two grow to be friends--no spoiler alert, come on, it's obvious! The idea of unity here is well-defined but Waititi resolves to some annoying shticks to get it done. For instance, he plays Adolf Hitler--not the actual Adolf Hitler but Jojo's choice for an imaginary friend. He often appears to Jojo and acts in a boyish manner. The surreal representation is cool at first but as it goes on, it starts to become pointless and its shtick wears thin. Happily, it's over before it becomes cringeworthy and is, nonetheless, an interesting exercise in screenwriting.<br/><br/>More heartwarming supporting characters arise in the form of Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) tasked with preparing the city for imminent invasion. He looks like he fights a losing fight and he knows it, but he keeps his chin up. The ending is fitting and expected, even if it doesn't define much which hasn't already been defined in this movie. To me, the only explanation to the weird pace and dreamy representation of the ending battle is that Waititi shows this movie through the eyes of children--unable to fully grasp and comprehend its entirety so neither do we, watching."

"SaibalBandopadhyay","9","0","0","24 February 2020"," It's brilliant! And, I dare say, underrated and somewhat misunderstood.
","Never have I ever seen something like this. When I began this movie, I figured from the opening 10 minutes or so that this one is going to be a funny, ridiculing take on the well documented WW2 Nazi Germany. Sure, the ironic and farcical elements were to the point and actually quite hilarious at times, but I thought that would be that. I'll have a good laugh, then question myself for laughing, and then I'll forget this movie and move on. When I was done with this one, I could hardly think about anything else, and I still can't. This movie is a genius piece of art that needs more appreciation and acknowledgement.
I thought the concept of looking at the WW2 Nazi Germany from a child's point of view, and especially, from a pro-Nazi kid who wants to join the army and fight alongside Hitler was a brilliant idea. This allows the movie to depict the massive propaganda and brainwashing that was done to the youth of Germany to train their minds into an absolute loathing and hatred of Jews. This is exactly why Adolf Hitler is here a funny and ridiculous character who is an imaginary friend of Jojo. This is what the kids felt in those times, they thought of Hitler as someone they liked and wanted to be friends with because of the way they were taught about him. However, the artistic brilliance is, despite a funny portrayal of him, Hitler in the movie is hardly qualified to become a role-model. He dressing sense is not heroic, rather really stupid and buffoonish, his temperament is childlike and devoid of sense, and he is also portrayed as scared of many things. The cheerful fashion in which the kids are trained to throw grenades and burn books and are told all sorts of devilish fantastical things about Jews which to them are creatures quite different, is funny and also extremely satirical. The humour in this movie is never too-forced, albeit it stretches to the ridiculous but that's not of bad taste, at least for me. Special mention to the ""German-Shepherd"" moment and also, Rockwell's comical personality as a whole.
The fascinating concept of the movie is backed up and at times lifted up further by amazing individual performances by each and every member of the cast, even Rebel Wilson, who is her usual eccentric self. Now, all this aside, the real show-stealer in the movie is the truly heartfelt emotional moments which takes this movie to a different level altogether. The incredibly powerful ""shoe-scene"", the relationship between Elsa and Jojo, the ""they love ugly people"" followed by Jojo's reflection of his own face in the mirror, and special mention to Sam Rockwell's final scene. This scene truly describes Waititi's idea of this movie. Rockwell's character, despite being a Nazi Officer and portraying the bad guy, actually helps Jojo and Elsa out of a tight situation and ultimately, saves Jojo's life. Therefore, although he perhaps has taken many innocent lives based on his character, he does save one life at the end. This could be seen in the light that even the most-cruel people are capable of change. I thought this sends a wonderful message to the audience. The contrasting scenes of Wilson sending a young boy to ""hug"" a Russian enemy with a bomb on his back and this final scene of Rockwell saving Jojo's life and dying right after made me really thinking.
Finally, the all-important purpose of the movie, which has divided opinions among critics. Some say this movie is too casual and lighthearted in its approach towards very dark times, some believe it miscommunicates the identity and personality of Hitler. However, watching the movie closely makes it clear that Waititi, despite all the humour and ridicule, sends a strong message: Love triumphs Hate no matter what. This is quite well documented through the course of the film and the ridiculous and farcical elements in the movie only makes this message more vividly visible. Now, the question remains, are you ready for it?"

The message is certainly something for this world today and I hope you love it like I did :)"

","First of all the satire in the fact that this movie is a comedy coming from the lense of a ""nazi"" little boy was super original and I loved it. Everything works perfect together. The entire movie is bright and fun but there's always this undertone that the war will end soon and this naive town will soon plummet into reality that their icon (Hitler) is one of the most evil men of all time. Sam Rockwell was the standout roll in this movie since he really made the audience care about his outrageous character and I loved every minute he was on screen. This movie is packed full of heart."
"coasterdude44","9","0","0","20 February 2020"," Waititi does it again with flying colours doing what he does best, turning tragedy into comedy
","Taika Waititi is one of my favourite directors for a number of reasons. He is the master in taking tragedy and terrible events and turning them into comedy so brilliantly and so well. Hunt for the Wilderpeople was previously my favourite movie from him, as he takes tragedy from his characters and just pisses all over them with such style and grace that their mysterious pasts don't even matter anymore and creates some of the most refreshing and original comedy ever seen in movie history.<br/><br/>With Jojo Rabbit, Waititi has finally mastered his craft in taking the tragic tale of WW2 and Hitler and turning it into some of the best pisstake comedy I have seen in years. Waititi does an outstanding job at portraying the funny side of Hitler aswell as directing a movie so crisp and detailed with such likeable and sharply written characters that are memorable as well as relateable<br/><br/>The whole message of the movie in my opinion is just the sheer pointless nature of war and the absurdity of conflicting views based on difference of nationalism and religious beliefs. The character of Jojo was perfectly casted in my opinion aswell as the rest of the cast. Scarlett Johansen plays an incredible role as Jojo's Mom who has a lot to say of what it was like to be a woman in those times. The movie is a prime example of how evil spreads from mind to mind through spreading fear over people of difference of nationality and religion once again revealing the absurdity of it all and creating some of the most unique humor in such a long time<br/><br/>Once again huge kudos to the production design and direction of the movie which captures the time period aswell as the atmosphere as as the people of WW2 Germany perfectly. I'm going to spoil a scene in this movie but there is a very emotional moment in it where the movie is shot in a way where it looks like the surrounding houses are looking down on Jojo and judging him. I thought that scene was brilliantly done. Waititi has become a master at portraying the inner emotions of each main character and how they see and react to the world around them, finally taking away the mystery of each character and providing a crystal clear lens into the nature of each character. The supporting cast is great too with a very funny supporting performance from Stephen Merchant as one of the Nazi supporters.<br/><br/>Overall I had a great time with Jojo Rabbit and has my vote and support for winning Oscar for best casting, direction and screenplay. I will complain of this masterpiece doesn't win a single Oscar because it deserves it."
"slash83_mus","10","0","0","18 February 2020"," Fascism and its downfall as seen by a 10-year old boy
","It's hard to describe just how beautiful this movie really is. We have been beaten to death in the past 75 years with WW2 movies. WW2, and especially its cause, has been used as a metaphor for current political developments so often that people have begun to be desensitized by it. Comparing contemporary populist politicians with Fascism and Nazism has become so inordinate that it's now a running joke amongst populist and alt-right voters to a point it has become almost meaningless.<br/><br/>But once in a while, this message is dissected meticulously to its core by some of the most creative minds of their generation and then presented to us in a truly unique way, gracefully moving and dancing around the perpetual pitfalls of most other war movies. After 'la Vita √© Bella' and 'Er ist wieder da' now comes JoJo Rabbit.<br/><br/>In its essence, the cause for war and ultimately the Holocaust was steady, organized polarization, desensitization and mass propaganda through education. In Germany, this started at a very young age in school and then through paramilitary indoctrination, from age 10, in the Jungvolk (10-14) and Hitlerjugend (14-18). JoJo Rabbit tells the story of a 10-year old boy, Johannes, who is already a fanatical admirer of Hitler before he starts his uniformed life as a Jungvolk member. Through his eyes, we see how he experiences the last year of the war (mid-44 to mid-45) in a way only kids can: blissfully naive, energetic and full of dreams. His imaginary best friend is Hitler himself. The world around him is harsh and unforgiving, but in his mind, it's all playful and understandable. It reminds me so much of how I experienced my life at a young age.<br/><br/>Many critics panned this movie for being silly, leaving out the holocaust and most true horrors of war. But they completely miss the point; this is war as experienced by a 10-year old. This is no funny satire, this is not a comedy. This is a story about love, prejudice and ultimately freedom, with some very Monty Python-esque storytelling and humor to set its tone.<br/><br/>Go see it."

","Jo Jo Rabbit is very fun & sweet movie despite dealing with such a serious subject.The story is from Nazi Germany period where Hitler is ruling.The 10 year boy joins the youth training camp, and he has Hitler as an imaginary friend played by director Taika Waititi himself.He has nothing but hate for jews.
The film is a satire/parody of the Nazi Germany period.The film gives message of anti-hate.There are obvious flaws here & there.The Nazi Germany period isn't explored well, the Jew side isn't shown much except one character.But the film still turns out very well, and we get conclusion of War & Hate in the later part of the movie, and that is what the film aims for.
The child is the highlight of the film and we see everything from his prospective, he is sweet & likeable, Scarlett Johansson played his mom.She gave an amazing performance in the table scene, maybe that's why she was nominated for Oscar.The Jew girl was really good too.The final scene was very lovely"

This made me laugh(which is amazing based on the subject matter, it made me feel sick and it made me cry and rejoice for the goodness of human kind all in the space of 1 hour and 45 min.<br/><br/>The acting by Mckenzie was INCREDIBLE and by far one of my favorite movie characters of all time. She was able to be strong and vulnerable at the same time. She was incredibly authentic.<br/><br/>I think my main take from the movie is summed up in one of the best lines, when Rosie and Jojo are looking at the recently hanged people in the street he asks her ""what did they do?"" and she replies ""what they could"". So much power in this, and he later states it to himself when the war ends. We all can do a little to end hate, to be our best selves, to improve the world around us and dance because we are free.<br/><br/>Highly suggest watching this. I recognize its a hard topic to have comedy and satire, but recognizing the director is of Jewish heritage helps this sentiment a lot.

","Detailing some of the most horrendous periods of the twentieth-century might be complicated, especially when the setting is Germany during WWII. As earlier films have demonstrated, it occasionally required some violent shoots with explicit blood as Saving Private Ryan, hostile behaviour towards the Jude population to the point it could affect the audience sensibility as Schindler's List. Nevertheless, for some reason, Jojo Rabbit is an excellent example of how we can change the viewpoint of memorable events in history even in the darkest hours. Indeed, young spectators will understand, have fun and, more important, learn from past errors which affected millions of innocent souls.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbits exceeds the initial expectations you might have before you bought the ticket to the theatre. It serves as a portrayal of children indoctrination through society. The manner they normalise violence, racism towards Judes, blind subordination to the Fuhrer, and so forth. The sense of humour touches these themes, so correctly, it does not impact the audience aggressively. The film introduces rough, gentle and bold characters who are flawlessly performed by a spectacular cast.<br/><br/>Honourably, 2019 was the year of Scarlet Johansson owing to her phenomenal roles in Avengers: Endgame, Marriage Story and her sweetest performance I have witnessed so far in Jojo Rabbit. Furthermore, the friendship of Roman Griffin (Jojo Betzler) and Archie Yates (Yorki) without being aware of what was going on during Nazi Germany is an absolute win. In spite of being children, they have demonstrated engaging chemistry and comradeship during the montage. The best part is that aside from the film, for example, at the red carpet of the UK, this twosome interacts as if they were long-time mates which makes their bonds grow even stronger.<br/><br/>When it comes to comedy, there is always a compound of experience (actress Rebel Wilson from ""Pitch Perfect"" and Taika Waititi from ""Thor: Ragnarok"") cheering up the atmosphere alongside with refreshed sense of childlike humour provided by German youngsters. Amidst jokes, you can find hidden facts about the Hitlerjugend as it is the case of splitting boys (to military duties and heavy tasks) and girls (to the Bund Deutscher M√§del so that they specialise on how to become exemplary housewives and raise the next generation properly). Charming Rosie Betzler (Scarlet Johansson) is a verdict representation of the national resistance against Hitler. Despite the danger it represented, the personas fight for what each of them believes, this is another reason why I consider this film a chef-d'oeuvre. Don't miss the opportunity to watch it!<br/><br/>(83/100)"

"krskrishnan","8","0","0","9 February 2020"," A must see satire: a reminder to worse times
","Biopics and historical films make charming materials to watch. They provide learning and insights into what ought to be or not. 'Jojo Rabbit' is a seemingly light hearted treatise into a bygone era of hate, suspicion and state-run terror in Hitler's Germany towards the end of World War II.<br/><br/>The film unfold through the travails of a fancifully jingoistic Jojo (Roman Davis) who is charmed by Hitler's Third Reich, albeit in an innocent way. Jojo is indoctrinated by Adolf (played by Taika Waititi) a comical, imaginary version of Adolf Hitler, who serves as Jojo's soul-keeper. He is an active participant in the Hitler youth camp along with his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates). The camp is run by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) assisted by Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) - hilariously enacted by both. Jojo's mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) an anti-Nazi rebel, secretly harbours a Jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in her attic, hitherto unknown to Jojo. Soon Jojo finds out about Elsa - which confuses his mind about loyalty and rightness.<br/><br/>The plot develops around Jojo and Elsa - and how Jojo's false notions about Jews transforms into reality, resulting in his liking for Elsa. In the meantime Jojo's mother is hanged by Nazis, leaving him in the sole company of Elsa. And outside, the regime is falling, while the Allies troops romp in - and the film ending on with feel-good factor.<br/><br/>The plain narrative, embellished with layers of fantasy laced in between, makes the film a pleasant viewing. The witty and at times hilarious dialogues, makes the satire feel full of life. The film is also a gentle reminder to the worse times, not long ago - and why we must cherish the values gained.<br/><br/>I will vote this for an Oscar."
"andrewmosteller","8","0","0","8 February 2020"," Oddly Wholesome If a Bit Too Lighthearted
","The film eschews most of the horror of the Nazi regime in favor of a light and goofy atmosphere. That said, I do think the film expects viewers to bring their historical understanding of the Nazis so it can play with those expectations to humorous effect. That might not be a person's cup of tea, which is totally understandable, but it's a common humorous trope to paint horrible things in a coat of frivolity. Making this film less a useful historical probe, and more a probe into the nature of interpersonal relationships in a society with a clearly wacky and racist dogma. Despite what a person is brought up to believe, real, meaningful experience with those who have been othered can bring about internal change. So yeah, the moral reads more like a Disney film set in absurdist Nazi Germany, but, if you're into that, it's quite charming and oddly wholesome if a bit too lighthearted."
"ayrton_seno","8","0","0","5 February 2020"," Maybe being a Nazi was also a horror on its own?
","I don't get the fuss about this movie, seriously people it's 2020. You are watching a political satire. You should expect that some people will be made fun of. I think the ultimate respect for the victims is to consistently make fun of such fascistic dictatorship and point out how such behaviours could have been prevented with more active involvement.<br/><br/>I feel the whole analogy of Hitler talking to a child who doesn't understand the strength of such words and actions, perfectly illustrates what Nazis were all about while living the lie of ideology. Characters are convincing and charming and the cinematography is beautiful. I don't think Scarlett Johansson will win an Oscar for this one and Waititi remains consistent to his style portraying the ungrateful role of Adolf Hitler in a decent and entertaining manner. On the other hand, the raw talent of Roman Griffin Davis is out of this world, being able to capture a wide spectrum of emotions at such an early age.<br/><br/>Lastly, I think this quote by Thomasin McKenzie outlines the whole idea of the movie and illustrates the lie Nazi Germany was living at that time: ""You're a ten year-old kid, who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club. But you are not one of them."""
"shimenpf","8","0","0","5 February 2020"," A masterclass on character arc and theme
","Jojo Rabbit is a fascinating satire that succeeds with its comedy while giving very powerful emotional moments as well. The film stands out for the way Jojo's character act is crafted. His firm Nazi posture is challenged with the natural opposite (having to hide a Jew girl in his house, with whom he ends up falling in love). Every single character in the movie is there for a purpose in Jojo's arc. Jojo's mom, Elsa (the Jew girl), Yorki or even Captain Klenzendorf are there to ultimately push Jojo into challenging his own ideals, and what he believes is right and wrong. Hitler is there as a personification of Jojo's ideals, as well as a resistance to change in his morals. Just as these characters, the plot forces change in Jojo in a subtle, natural and believable way. Whether is his mother's dead or the Nazis losing the war, these situations end up pushing Jojo into his ultimate change.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film. I really loved 1917, and I want it to win the Oscar to Best Motion Picture. However, I wouldn't be mad at all if Jojo Rabbit wins. It's a great film and it would be great to see a comedy film win the prize."
"jtindahouse","7","0","0","4 February 2020"," Waititi can't put a foot wrong at the moment
","'Jojo Rabbit' is a really odd little film when you think about it. It's a satirical comedy about one of the most serious and dark times in human history. And yet somehow Taika Waititi manages to make it work. Now don't think that just because I'm a fellow New Zealander I will give Waititi a free pass on all his films. He's proving himself to be a very fine film-maker, but I'm far from his biggest fan. This film is almost impossible to hate though. If directing is considered to be Waititi's biggest strength, then his acting can't be far behind. He has incredible comedic timing and it is on full display in 'Jojo Rabbit'. Every scene he appears in is an absolute treat.<br/><br/>The film has been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards in a few days time. It deserves its nomination (I mean if you make a film about WW2 then you're about a 50% chance of getting nominated from the get go these days) but I can't see it managing to get the win. It just doesn't feel like the type of film that will appeal to quite enough voters to get over the line. Scarlett Johansson has also been nominated for Actress in a Supporting Role. This is incredibly her second acting nomination in the same year, combining with a Lead Role nomination for 'Marriage Story'. Supporting Actress is usually a very weak category, but her performance here is admittedly great. She has a limted time to make us fall in love with and care for her character, and she achieves it and then some. A lot of years she would be a serious chance of taking home the award, but I feel that her 'Marriage Story' co-star Laura Dern will be too strong this year.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie is amazing. It would take me too long to list all the great actors they managed to get on-board for this project. None of the them are a let down either. They all are perfectly cast and play to their strengths exquisitely. The thing about this film is that it is often so light-hearted and funny that when something serious happens it really takes you off-guard and hits you hard. You are suddenly jolted back into the reality that you are watching a Nazi war film. I had a good time with 'Jojo Rabbit'. It was about what I expected in relation to tone and I felt it worked well. It's worth a look."

","One thing that bothers me about this film, and that I have a hard time getting over, is the casting of Thomasin McKenzie as the sole Jewish character. Yes, the Nazis are portrayed as stupid, ignorant, and buffoons, but their ugly caricatures of Jews (rats, horns, scales, evil, etc.) are relentless. Yes, of course, the Jewish character in the film is the complete opposite of the caricatures; she's beautiful, strong, sensitive, loving.<br/><br/>But my issue is this: Thomasin is not Jewish! She's a New Zealander of Anglo-Celtic origin. She doesn't even look remotely Jewish, outside of her brown hair. Couldn't they have cast a Jewish actress for the role of the ONLY Jewish character in the film? People still make fun of old westerns where they cast white guys as Native Americans. It just feels insensitive, dismissive, disrespectful, wrong."

","It's Mel Brooks meets Wes Anderson with dashes of Amelie. Hard to believe I could laugh so much and stifle tears to the point where I think I might start blubbering in a theatre over a movie about Nazis and Hitler. They don't seem to go together. Well, humor and adorableness don't seem to go in the same sentence as Nazis and Hitler. There truly were no flaws in this movie. The directing, acting, writing was seamless. It had depth and was never one-note, and really left you thinking afterwards. I imagine it will be up for numerous Oscars, and I'll be surprised if it doesn't win multiple.<br/><br/>The kids who played Jojo and Elsa were a delight. It's hard to believe there's that much talent in kids that age. They could be both humorous and endearing, and had wonderful chemistry with each other. I was surprised at how good Scarlett Johannsen was, as she usually plays the ""hot girl,"" or she's kicking someone in the face. She really gave a wonderful, heartfelt performance, and you really grew to care about her relationship with her son and her role in trying to free Germany from oppression and do her part.<br/><br/>The film maintained the perfect balance and never went too far with it's humor, and never spoon-fed the audience with the obvious message of Nazis, propaganda, oppression, and war are bad. There were a few uncomfortable moments with Jojo's trained beliefs, but I felt they were important to break from the humor to the reality that this kid was brainwashed with some really nasty stuff. It sold the evolution of the relationship between Jojo and Elsa so that it wasn't patronizing or predictable.<br/><br/>Just a delight, and wonderful film making on the part of Taika Waititi. I could see how some may see the trailer, not see the film, and think the subject matter is being trivialized in some way by some insensitive WASP director. When, in fact, it was the exact opposite, and the director is Jewish. That shouldn't have to be mentioned, but in todays current climate where extremist think there are Nazis under every rock, and who need to project their offense at everything to somehow make someone else's struggle about them, I think it's worth mentioning. And, in all likely, those types would hate this film anyway since their solution to everything is punching someone in the face or screaming someone down, where the message of this film is that change comes from talking, learning, understanding, and growth, that leads to compassion and love."

","""Jojo Rabbit"" embodies what cinema should be: a rollercoaster ride of emotions packed with an important message. And starting with this last aspect, the movie is about a young boy who lives in Germany during the Nazi period. His mother teaches him the values of love and respect while the society inculcates him the Nazi ideology, which is the one he grows with. So at the age of ten he is a blind fanatic but it's clear from the beginning that he posses some of his mother's lessons that he rejects strongly. The encounter with a jewish girl that his mother is hiding in their house is the start of an evolution of Jojo's personality and I stop here as far as the plot. I can say that this is the setting of a satire about the Nazi ideology, that makes fun of it and shows how stupid it is. The other aspect I mentioned is the ride of emotions. The great thing about ""Jojo Rabbit"" is that you enter the movie and you have almost two hours in which you feel every emotions: I laughed a lot and in some cases I lost it, I felt pressure and anxiety, I was moved by sadness and by joy. And all this emotions were perfectly balanced in the flow of the movie. I am a big Taika Waititi's fan and in this movie he outdid himself.

","Funny. Premise, script, acting, everything in this movie is funny.
It is hard to believe that at some point halfway through the movie there is an event that makes you hold your breath for a few minutes like It does.
In this one Taika Waititi goes for a more Wes Anderson like directing and framing than I remember from his previous films, but you can tell he is behind the project beacuse of the humour It emantes.
Overall It was an absolute joy to watch and I would like to make an special mention for Scarlett Johansson who managed to bring to live a character that acts like 3 different people but yet feels real in this crazy universe.<br/><br/>If you are fond of Taika Waititi's humour don't miss It."
"kysollesta","10","3","8","16 January 2020"," A film that will stay with you for a while.
","I didn't initially know what to expect from it. It definitely was a good comedy and it delivered the laughs, what was surprising how it can break your heart as well and make you feel a little bit upset that Jojo had to live in a time like that. It was definitely thought provoking and im actually happy that it was a film based on the German's side. I grew up watching WWII Hollywood Films...it's eye opening the see what war was like from the other side as well. Also it helps to have a good knowledge of World War 2, not necessary, but definitely made the punchline funnier."
"bankofmarquis","9","3","8","15 January 2020"," Inventive, funny and poignant
","Writer/Director/Actor Taika Waititi is one of the most original voices working in Film/Television today. He skewered the Vampire flick (at the height of the Twilight craze) in WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS. He revived the sagging Thor saga (and some would say the Marvel Cinematic Universe) with a comedic approach to the material in THOR: RAGNAROK, and now with his latest film, JOJO RABBIT, he takes his sense of humor to a subject that is difficult to satire - Adolph Hitler and life in Nazi Germany during WW II.<br/><br/>And, darn it all, if he doesn't pull it off.<br/><br/>As seen through the eyes of a zealous 10 year old Hitler Youth named JoJo, this film follows Jojo's journey from an idealistic follower of all things Nazi Germany to the harsher realities of the world - and what the 3rd Reich means to the world.<br/><br/>Young Roman Griffin Davis does a marvelous job as the titular character slowly changing his character from an all out innocent devotion to Hitler (his imaginary friend as played by Waititi) to a somewhat less innocent soul. His journey is at the heart of this film and he is a winning personality to follow along with. I was drawn into his struggles and was rooting for him to ""come to his senses"" throughout the course of this film.<br/><br/>Helping him in this journey is his Mother, played in an Oscar nominated turn by Scarlett Johannson. This character has an idealism all of her own and is willing to let her child ""get there in his own time"". It is a strong turn by Johannson...but Oscar nominated worthy? I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Also joining in for fun, frolic and (by turns) seriousness is the always great Sam Rockwell (Oscar winner for 3 BILLBOARDS...)as a disillusioned German Officer, comedian Stephen Merchant (LOGAN) in an unlikely mostly serious turn as a Nazi who likes to say ""Heil Hitler"" and Alfie Allen (GAME OF THRONES) as a devoted German soldier (at least devoted to Rockwell's character). Waititi also uses Rebel Wilson sparingly - as she should be used - as another devouted-to-the-cause German citizen.<br/><br/>Adding heft and pathos to this film is Thomasin MacKenzie (THE KING) in a role that would be a spoiler to say what she is playing, but...I WILL say that she needs to succeed in this role for the film to succeed (and she does).<br/><br/>Also, special notice needs to be made of the performance of cherubic Archie Yates (soon to be Kevin in the reboot of the HOME ALONE franchise) as JoJo's friend Yorki - who keeps getting knocked down and steps back up over and over again. I would LOVE to see the film that would have focused on this character (in addition to this film).<br/><br/>And, finally, there is the Writer/Director himself, Taika Waititi as JoJo's imaginary friend, Adolph Hitler. He is all fun loving and gay at the beginning becoming more and more frantic as the film progresses - mimicking the real life events that are happening around him.<br/><br/>Waititi's style in this film is reminiscent of Wes Anderson in such films as THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL and MOONRISE KINGDOM and this works well here, giving this film more of a ""fable"" than a ""realistic"" look - and that is important to help set the tone for the events that follow. Waititi has a sure hand on the material (that he wrote) as the Director. He knows the tone he wants to strike and knows how to get there. He is nominated for Adapted Screenplay for his script (deservedly so) and was NOT nominated for Best Director - but his work in this area is just as good.<br/><br/>I did not know what to expect from this film when I walked into it, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Give this little comedy/drama a try - I think you will be glad you did.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

They really undercut the power and intelligence of the film with their slapstick comedy approach. Now granted, there were many absurdist comedic elements (and they were hilarious...

","Jojo Rabbit is quite simply one of the best films I've seen. I would say this year, but its only January 5th - so I'm happy to put that claim into the 'ever' section of my reviews!<br/><br/>With such simplicity, director Taika Waititi gives us an emotional roller-coaster ride of hilarious comedy, heartbreaking moments, poignant scenes, romance, friendship, realism, and war... And he delivers it almost flawlessly in one of the greatest satirical movies ever.<br/><br/>Child actor Roman Griffin Davis is just super cute as Jojo, delivering an incredible performance as a dedicated child of Hitlers youth who's only dream is to be in his army and is guided through life by his imaginary friend - Hitler himself, played hilariously by director Taika!<br/><br/>Taika just nails it as an insecure leader of the people, offering up ridiculous plans and ideas to try and guide little Jojo through life as a nazi. His portrayal of der Fuher is just brilliant and, to me, came across like a human version of Bugs Bunny in many physical moments as well as his silly ideas...<br/><br/>Loved it!<br/><br/>In fact, the casting of everyone involved just works wonderfully!! I couldn't find fault with any of them. Scarlett was brillaint as his mother as was Thomasin McKenzie as his Jew friend-love-interest hiding in the attic. Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen's hidden love was so well done, as were their characters, and Jojo's little friend Yorki is equally as cute and funny with his little random scenes and delivery, but for me, RGD totally steals the show as Jojo - delivering a number of heartbreaking moments with such a natural performance.<br/><br/>I love Jojo Rabbit and can't wait to see it again!<br/><br/>An amazing film!!"

","Any other movie that tries or has ever tried to make a comedy out of being a Nazi in WWII has, or will, inevitably fail. It SHOULD be impossible. There should be no way to take that kind of subject matter and treat it with the respect it deserves, while also maintaining a lighthearted, comedic tone. But this, this actually does it flawlessly. Some of the humor isn't even that dark, and it still works consistently.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, this movie gets pretty hard to watch. Really hard to watch at times.And yet, right up until the end, it never loses it's audience or goes TOO deep into the dark stuff. It masterfully walks a tightrope between the horrors of war/Nazi-ism on one side, and a child coming of age on the other, with Taika Watiti's signature brand of weird comedy weaved throughout. Honestly I think it could even be a solid introduction for children who don't know about WWII, it's that good.<br/><br/>The performances are fantastic across the board, the dialogue is brilliant, the cinematography has some great moments, etc. In conclusion, it's good, go watch it. Especially if you're a Nazi."
"ernestsavesxmas","9","3","8","17 December 2019"," Satire in its truest form
","A satire in the truest form, Jojo Rabbit took a moment to get its tonal footing, but when it did: wow, it's a rollercoaster of sadness and humor that hits all the classic movie beats. I think this film and its anti-hate message has the chance to age really well, and definitely one I can see enjoying immensely on repeat viewings. Taika Waititi has cemented himself as a major filmmaker with this effort. Portraying ""imaginary friend Hitler"" himself--a bit that could've really ran itself into the ground if it wasn't deployed with such masterful restraint--Waititi deserves extra commendation for having directed such a great film while, you know, dressed like that. Predictably great performances abound from the two A-listers (+ a brief, but highly entertaining one-scene cameo by the great Stephen Merchant), but it's really the A+ acting of the young leads Roman Griffin Davis in the titular role and Thomasin McKenzie who tie it all together. I highly recommend it in spite of the German accents.<br/><br/>Also, one more thing that I debated even addressing with this review: I didn't realize how extremely polarizing this film was in the critical realm. The negative reviews are harsh as hell and all seem, to me at least, to miss the point entirely by focusing on the outlandish stereotype tropes, etc. I somewhat get the idea it is too fluffy given the underlying subject matter, but that feels like such an obvious choice; how can you slam it like it's the byproduct of neglect or laziness or whatever? I don't necessarily think it's a full-on classic but, A) I really liked it, and B) I do feel like history will be kind to it, even if (ironically?) its lack of regard for history seems to be the biggest collective knock against it right now."

"olivewahh","10","4","13","11 December 2019"," One of the best films of the year
","I was not expecting this film to be as good as it is. There's usually two things that I'm not interested in with films and that's war and Nazis, which this film was about both.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is focused around a young child named Jojo who wants to go into the war just like his father did and join the Nazis to take down the Jews.
Jojo learns that his mother is hiding a Jew in the house and picks at her knowledge to learn everything he can about the Jews to write his book. But even though he's passionate about becoming a Nazi he must keep the hidden Jew a secret for protection of himself and his mother.<br/><br/>This movie is honestly one of my faves for the year. It reflects light and history on the past for the new generation to watch and learn without making it boring and losing interest.

And it gives the Jewish people a voice. It simply does this in a satirical way, which in my opinion is an absolutely brilliant way to do this, if done correctly. It's sad, happy, and in the end very uplifting. I cried tears of laughter, sadness, and joy. Please watch this movie. If you are to see any movie this year, please let it be Jojo Rabbit"

The main protagonist is a 10yo German boy who's imaginary friend and roll model is Adolf Hitler played by Taika Waititi, whose character along with the child's had the audience audibly laughing at least 10 times or more.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","4","13","1 November 2019"," Pure Genius- a once in a lifetime masterpiece.
","There are films that come around every now and then that seem to hit all the right notes and impact you in multiple ways. Very few times in my life as a film-goer have I seen a film that can make me laugh out loud in one moment, and then get me choked up literally 20 seconds later. Such is the beauty of New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi's ""JoJo Rabbit,"" an absolute triumph of a film and quite possibly the best film of 2019.<br/><br/>Set in Nazi Germany during WW II, 10-year-old JoJo is an avid supporter of radical fascist Adolf Hitler, brainwashed by Nazism as he dedicates himself to Hitler's Youth Army. JoJo is a social outcast, his only friend being his fellow Hitler Youth trainee Yorki. JoJo is bullied by his fellow Nazis, unable to find a place or purpose in his setting despite being so dedicated to the Fuhrer and his country.<br/><br/>While sounding strange, JoJo envisions Hitler himself as his personal imaginary friend (played brilliantly and hilariously by writer/director/producer Taika Waititi), who guides him through his difficulties and fills a much-needed void in his socially isolated life. JoJo's mother Rosie, on the other hand, is against the Nazi ideology, hiding a Jewish girl named Elsa within their walls in protection. Having his world view challenged, young JoJo finds himself caught between his feelings of love for his mother and his surprising friendship with Elsa and his dedication to the only world and he has ever known.<br/><br/>This is the type of film that could have very easily turned into an absolute disaster. So many films get overly ambitious with their outlandish stories that they end up crumbling down in their own goals and come off as pretentious rather than creative. Taika Waititi does a mesmerizing job of not only tackling this whacky concept for a film but delivers it in a pitch-perfect fashion that blends humor and heart masterfully. This isn't only the funniest film of the year, but the most heartwarming and moving film as well.<br/><br/>Waititi proves he's a master of storytelling and assembles a film with humor that isn't just silly, but witty and profound. Having such daring humor in such a heavy subject matter is a bold move for any filmmaker to take, and the director excels in every bit of making us laugh at something we feel like we shouldn't be. Sam Rockwell, Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy from ""Game of Thrones""), and Rebel Wilson provide excellent comedic relief and are consistently hilarious, yet its newcomer Archie Yates as Yorki who proves he's a comedian in the making, the young actor without a doubt in the works of becoming a comedic star.<br/><br/>Yet despite the genuine laugh-out-loud humor, Waititi grounds his film in a deep testament to love and coming-of-age. He doesn't center his film around Nazi Germany to get a rise out of people or show-off what he can do as a daring artist but rather uses his story to exert a beautiful tale of love and human growth. This is a film that most likely shouldn't have worked so well, yet Waititi's pure genius vision is delivered perfectly in every second of the film, his balance of comedy and heart an intoxicating phenomenon. This is cinema at its purest and most enjoyable form, executed perfectly from everyone working on the project.<br/><br/>Newcomer Roman Griffin Davis is an acting force to be reckoned with. In what is without a doubt one of the greatest acting performances by a child of all time, Davis does a profound job of making audiences of all ages identify with a young child and adore him despite being a follower of Nazism. From start to finish, we're captivated by this young man's journey and genuinely want his future to be bright. We're able to recognize that JoJo is a sweet young boy and not a vicious Nazi and that he is simply a product of his environment. We're able to feel for this boy due to showing signs of a good heart and for struggling to find his purpose in a world he feels overwhelmed and excluded in. Davis captures the vulnerability and awkwardness of youth in ways that everyone will be able to relate too and is infectious with his soulful and heartfelt performance. This kid is 10 and already deserves his first Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Scarlet Johanson does terrific work as JoJo's mother and gives the film a sweetness due to her loving nature and motherly tendencies with her son. There are scenes in this film with Johansson that any mother would be able to identify with, the beautiful actress elevating an endearing emotional core to the film.<br/><br/>Many have criticized the film for poking fun at such a disturbing time in history where millions of people were killed, but quite frankly those who criticize the film simply don't understand the satirical brilliance at work. This isn't a film that is trying to ""make light"" of the holocaust or WW II but rather uses it as a mechanism to express a story of anti-hate.<br/><br/>Taikia Waititi, a Jewish man himself, making us laugh as playing Hitler hilariously isn't in bad taste at all. Think about it. What better way to insult Hitler than have a Jewish man mock him and make him look like a complete fool? If Hitler saw this film he'd be infuriated, which alone is worth celebrating.<br/><br/>Waititi is brilliantly expressing how brainwashed and pathetic Nazism is and uses JoJo as his protagonist to explore the meaning of love and move away from hate. It's refreshing to see a film completely ignore what the far-left woke culture will find fault with and profoundly make a film with a bold style that isn't afraid to be itself and move audiences with its tender story about love and empathy. Masterful works of cinema like this come around very rarely, making ""JoJo Rabbit"" a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br/><br/>Creative films like this that can be so many things at once are a rare finding. Not only is this a stylish film with ambitious, well-composed cinematic techniques, but it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. The second it ended I wanted it to start back again from the beginning.<br/><br/>This is a film that gives you faith not only in the power of cinema but in the beauty of humanity. ""JoJo Rabbit"" has everything going for it without an issue in sight and is a film you deserve to see."

I didn't smile even once.<br/><br/>I have watched Hunters on Prime, and can't level the same complaint at that at all. Yes, the ending was 'strange' (keeping it spoiler-free) and there was definitely some licence taken and wasn't 'based on historical events' like they claimed. But I found they depicted the horrors.

I mean a 10 means the film is perfect and has company like The Godfather, The Matrix or Leon? Is this film on a par with those movies? clearly, absolutely not!<br/><br/>I assumed the 10/10 reviews were just bot generated and many look like they are, but some seem genuine. By the way IMDB, you really need to do something about this, way too many terrible films get a 10/10, especially modern releases.<br/><br/>Right from the off of this crap fest, the childish, camp, stupid attempts at humour fail completely. The film is boring, nothing interesting happens and who cares what a child thinks about Hitler and the war. The acting is awful, the script and story are poor, why would anyone praise this film. It was pretty much universally panned, quite rightly, by the critics. Its not even accidentally funny.<br/><br/>Nothing more to add other than this is rubbish."

"MovieCriticOnline","7","3","9","26 December 2019"," Definitely one of the best films of the year
","With so much trash coming out I see too many people praising the mediocre films coming out from mere desperation for something halfway decent. Then comes a real gem like this that really deserves the recognition. It was hilariously funny and also very sad.<br/><br/>I had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised by the approach to it. The acting was done with truthfulness even though the writing was obviously satire. They didn't overdo it, which is refreshing to see.<br/><br/>I am really critical of films and they seem to be getting worse so having something like this to enjoy is a blessing.<br/><br/>I wish they had the Yorki character (the fat kid) in more as he was just amazing. I save 10 stars for the truly amazing films that stand the test of time and this is a close 8, but I will leave at 7 until I see it again with time passing and still feel the same.<br/><br/>One of the funniest scenes is where Fraulein Rahm tells the nazi kid ""you see that American, go give him a hug"" while she straps a hand grenade on his body.. haha<br/><br/>A perfect balance of comedy and tragedy. Definitely a must see."

","Mix of dark comedy and serious drama.<br/><br/>Set in Germany during World War II, the star is a 10 year old boy at a military youth training camp, his imaginary best friend is Adolf Hitler. Adolf would appear when any mentoring is required. His mother is sheltering a Jewish girl, he discovers her hiding in the attic and a relationship develops, this conflicts with his anti-Semitic indoctrination.<br/><br/>This movie depicts the horrors of war through a child's point of view with some big scale sets towards the end when the allies arrive.

","This movie was BRILLIANT! Taika Waititi has proven himself as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation. There were two parts that made the movie for me, when he just jumped out the window for no reason, and when he was wearing the Native American head dress. The entire time he was wearing it, there was no reference or explanation to it....COMEDY GOLD! The cast was amazing, Scarlett Johanson and Sam Rockwell deliver Oscar worthy performances. I can not recommend this movie enough!"
"mwigent","9","3","9","9 November 2019"," Different experience at the movie
","If you believe the old saying that comedy is tragedy plus time, then you can get the first part of the movie. The comedy only lasts for so long and it is not a rollicking romp poking fun at the Hitler Youth throughout. It is an exploration in how easily manipulated, molded, scarred and indoctrinated youth are and the preciousness of life. We are all one race and those that try to divide us with looney tune notions need to be laughed at. The youth look at us for their cues. We hate; they hate. We love; they love. Let us teach children love and acceptance. Obviously Hitler was unredeemably evil. This movie takes Hitler and Nazis and removes the power of the image and makes him and Nazi notions the clownish nonsense they are and that should be laughed at. (Yes millions were killed in factories of death but this is not that movie - It tries to make you laugh at them instead of being overwhelmed by their power and savagery and trail of countless bodies). If you are an adult and look fondly to the Third Reich, you need serious help and deprogramming."
"Mijla","9","6","24","19 October 2019"," Divisive yet incredibly endearing movie
","Movie opinions are subjective by nature and Jojo Rabbit is a prime example of this. Technically it has some problems and it's fair to argue about the cartoonishness of the story, But... I loved it. It had me laughing out loud various times, is extremely entertaining to watch all the way through and left me with an all around great, optimistic feeling. This is especially noteworthy given the heavy topics this movie deals with. It's also impeccable timed, a great anti war, anti hate movie in a time when the world in many ways parallels the 1930s. Go watch, you won't regret it."

","Had a few satirical moments worth a chuckle, but this is not a comedy. Not an action movie. Not a true drama. Not sure how to describe it except to say that this was simply not a good movie. Go see something else."
"gbill-74877","5","2","5","25 February 2020"," Heart in the right place, but falls flat
","A timely film, given the rise of populist leaders whispering vile things into the thoughts of the masses. It's set in Nazi Germany, but those who promote hatred and insanity over love and rationality in all generations - particularly this one - are probably the target here. It's a film about perseverance, showing us that all of these types of leaders will pass eventually, and for that it should get credit.<br/><br/>The film is very ambitious in attempting both comedy and drama, and in such a highly sensitive context. For me, the comedy fell flat, and I didn't feel it was all that appropriate either. Its heart was in the right place and there were dark scenes to point out at least some of the atrocities which took place, but overall it felt just a little too glib. I was really squirming through the first half because I knew what it was going for, but didn't think it was adding anything insightful to the conversation. There are some nice moments in the back half, but by then it was too little, too late.<br/><br/>The dancing quote from Scarlett Johansson's character was nice (""we have to dance to show God we are grateful to be alive""), but the dancing at the end - even with the Rilke quote - seemed way off in tone to me. It seems to forget that after such nightmarish horror and personal loss, there are long stages of bereavement before such joy can be expressed. It's hard for me to fathom what an audience in 1945 would have thought of it."
"hp-33729","8","2","5","14 February 2020"," Moving subject
","Although this movie is set during WW2, its message is universal, and there are a lot of parallels with the current political climate as well: the blind faith in ""strong"", corrupt leaders and their stupid ideals, the indoctrination of kids with propaganda, the rage and hate towards certain groups of people and cultures due to sheer ignorance, cognitive dissonance, and so on. It's a cautionary tale about how you shouldn't allow yourself to be a pawn in this game, because in the end reality always comes crashing in, and it's never pleasant.<br/><br/>Although it has its flaws, Jojo Rabbit is a pretty good effort from Taika Waititi. The writing is spot on. It's funny and very moving at times. Don't expect it to be a full-on comedy though, like those reviewers who gave it 1 star because they didn't laugh enough. Talking about ignorance..."
"lotheravanti","8","2","5","9 February 2020"," A surprisingly deep movie
","I went into this only knowing that it's Taika playing Hitler as an imaginary friend to a Hitler Youth. I expected a comedy, what I got was a an incredible satire with comedic elements. This movie is deep and beautiful. I put it up there pretty close with Schindler's List, thought it's not quite THAT brutal.<br/><br/>Since I don't want to give any spoilers, I can only say that I truly believe you will not be disappointed with it. To make a movie such as this with such a controversial subject and do it so well shows sheer brilliance on Taika's part."

"andrewroy-04316","5","2","5","5 February 2020"," Some of the jokes land, and Thomasin McKenzie is fantastic, but beyond that Jojo is a tonally disjointed movie with nothing interesting to say
","While an odd comparison due to the contexts of subject matter, Jojo Rabbit feels like my Vice of 2019, but with better humor and even less to say. It is entertaining enough and has a couple solid performances, but doesn't feel like it has a real point. It's meant to be an anti-hate satire, and Hitler as an imaginary friend was a clever way of getting at that, but the absurd unrealism of all the German training/Reich scenes deadened the seriousness of the Nazi beliefs and the emotional impact of most scenes. It was obvious in poking fun at how ridiculous and over-the-top Nazi beliefs were by showing them through the eyes of a blind faith 10 year old, but it really didn't have anywhere to go from there. I would've liked to see more of how they get people like Jojo to buy their propaganda and beliefs, but instead we just have to accept that that's who he is at the start, which makes his turn to accept Elsa not emotionally impactful. The comedy is inconsistent - it has some really good moments (I loved the circumcision joke), but also a bunch that didn't land. The script is fairly spotty overall, particularly in the relationship between Jojo and his mother. There was a strange distance between them that is never explained, almost as though she's a step mother. After it gets the satirical premise out there in the first act, it stumbles through most of the second and third acts and ends pretty pointlessly.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though, and that's primarily thanks to Thomasin McKenzie. Between her unbelievable performance in Leave No Trace last year and now a great turn here, she's quickly become one of my favorite actresses. The only emotional resonance the movie has is in her fearful disposition to the world outside and her developing bond with Jojo, and honestly the humor that lands best is her knowing teasing of Jojo. I like Rockwell as always and liked his final scene, but there wasn't quite enough leading up to it to give it the full emotional force it could've had. It is an absolute abomination that Scarlett Johansson got a supporting actress nomination - she doesn't do much here and her performance is nothing at all compared to McKenzie's. I will be infuriated if this movie wins adapted screenplay over Little Women, as is likely, because it was a script that did a poor job with its characters aside from Elsa, had no arc or anything to think about, and even the comedy that I thought would be its hallmark was spotty. It's not quite a bad movie, but it's shallow, providing nothing interesting to mull over, and falls on its face balancing absurdist humor with emotional or serious war scenes."
"jfgibson73","6","2","5","2 February 2020"," It's a normal stalemate
","Here was something different. A young boy living in Nazi Germany idolizes Hitler but then falls in love with a girl hiding in his house. I didn't find this movie laugh out loud funny. I was more like thinking in my head that there were some clever moments. And one shocking one. I didn't really get that invested in it, but it did have a nice, satisfying ending."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","2","5","1 February 2020"," Heartbreaking yet hilarious.
","Jojo Rabbit tells the story of a 10-year-old Nazi supporter, Jojo(Roman Griffin Davis). Jojo discovers that his mother Rosie(Scarlett Johansson), is hiding a Jewish girl named Elsa(Thomasin McKenzie), in their house.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is a fantastic film. Writer-director Taika Waititi has given us another masterpiece after, What We Do in the Shadows(2014), Hunt for the Wilderpeople(2016) & Thor: Ragnarok(2017). This movie is hysterical for the most part. However, there are also scenes that will make you tear up & when the credits start rolling, you will be forced to introspect. That is the beauty of Jojo Rabbit. The performances are the highlight of the film. Roman Griffin Davis knocks it out of the park in his acting debut, as Jojo. Davis carries the movie on his shoulders & portrays a wide variety of emotions, over the course of its run-time. Thomasin McKenzie is spectacular as Elsa. McKenzie gives us a flawless performance & she is an actress to watch out for, in Hollywood. Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as Rosie. Johansson definitely deserves both her Oscar nominations. Best Actress for Marriage Story & Best Supporting Actress for this movie. Taika Waititi is brilliant as Adolf. Waititi brings his signature brand of humor, to his performance. Sam Rockwell is awesome as Captain Klenzendorf. Rebel Wilson is great as Fraulein Rahm. Alfie Allen is superb as Finkel. Stephen Merchant is unforgettable as Deertz. Archie Yates is adorable as Yorki. Jojo Rabbit is a must watch. It deserves all the nominations, this awards season."

"zsebmatyi","10","2","5","29 January 2020"," One of the best WW movies
","Although I think World at War movies are going on a same trailroad like superhero movies (well not in quantity but we have 2 or 3 every year that tells the tragedy of a certain event for some who were not listening on history class).<br/><br/>Simply telling a tragedy as it is especially in Hungary where you also have 2 or 3 more movies (not counting the international movies), that tells you about the suffering. It is hard to get any emotion or story from them anymore. Maybe the first 3 that you choose can shock you but then you will always know what to expect.<br/><br/>Regarding Jojo Rabbit the director plays with your feels. By using pauses, comicality of situatuions, and helping the audience to emphasize with the actors.<br/><br/>In my view we live in ridiculously politically correct world. The sensitiveness and the ""pretending"" of respect for each other race has gone over the line. However the movie tells you the story in a way that helps you connect with the world of the mid 19's and it will make you crack up, laugh when ever you see a symbol of the german reign."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","2","5","28 January 2020"," Whimsical but Honest, Colorful but Draining, Jojo is Both Wonderful and Terrible
","Alternating between bitter poignance and flippant hilarity, Jojo Rabbit thrives as an emotional rollercoaster. Gravely serious situations are often cut with a well-timed, stress-melting laugh. Light moments of childish infatuation take a sudden swerve into existential turmoil. That's a hallmark of director Taika Waititi, who explored similarly polarizing contrasts in Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and, as it turns out, it's also the essence of childhood during wartime.<br/><br/>Here we spend time with a ten-year-old German boy (passionately interested in the fading Third Reich), his troubled but deeply caring mother, the comically inept Nazis left to supervise their small town, and the sarcastic Jewish girl secreted away in their attic. Largely due to circumstance, the kids deal with some very adult subjects, trying everything to convince their peers to take them seriously. It doesn't work, of course, and that leads to some of the richest comedy, so they redouble their efforts. It's only in the very last scene, with the shadow of impending invasion finally past, that the specter of assumed adulthood is released and we finally catch a glimpse of these children acting their age. I wasn't sure the film would actually come together until that perfect moment, but what rich rewards for a thoroughly up-and-down journey.<br/><br/>Whimsical but honest, colorful but draining, it's both wonderful and terrible, often at the same time. My spine was shivering as it cut to the credits."

New Zealand film director wonder Taika Waititi not only tiptoes a dangerous minefield of comedy tragedy, but also inhabits a Stoogey Fuhrer in one of the most outrageous acting stabs in recent memory.<br/><br/>Everything revolves around giddy Hitler Youth Jojo (fabulously sincere and boyishly feverish Roman Griffin Davis), as he grows into his new double digit age, lapping up the local propaganda, eagerly striving to belong, and chumming about with his invisible chancellor pal. A sweet buddy-buddy picture? A vibrant coming of age story? A stunning moral tale? A slapstick comedy? A bloody war drama? It's all here. Plus Sam Rockwell!<br/><br/>Poking fun at historic tragedy with a short stick is dicey business, and though plenty of serious subplots run throughout, ""Jojo Rabbit"" works because the characters, from major to minor, are brilliantly developed, and impeccably acted.

The innocence of the kid shows us where we can blindly follow and be brainwashed no matter how absurd the belief. But when faced with actual reality that clashes with your belief are we willing to let go?
This movie is not perfect. For one the comedy does over shadow the tragedy. The tragedy gets glossed over. But I think we all know the tragedy and horror that happened. This movie isn't focused on that rather the absurdity of the belief system that brought it about."

Its an emotional rollercoaster of ups, downs, uncertainty, uncomfortableness, and clarity. The artistic elements create a surreal, dreamlike quality; reminding the viewer that it's about a child and his perception of the world. It shifts as he grows. There's many Story interpretations, which to me make it brilliant. Along with the theme of balancing tragedy with comedy, it's really a story of the unsung hero's of WWII, and life.

However the best performance in the film by far is by the young Roman Griffin Davis who sells off his performance of being a young child during Hitlers reign in Germany so believable if you showed a clip of him in this movie to someone out of context they may think it's archived footage from WW2 Nazi Germany (Only if they haven't heard of this movie of course because these performances need to be heard about more!). Not only is the acting incredible the writing is fantastic! The writing is witty and hilarious when it needs to be and sad and miserable when it needs to be. There is also a direction in this movies is as clear as a black sheep. Mind you this movie was also directed by the man himself Taika Waititi.
To conclude JoJo Rabbit is a movie I can see myself watching for decades in the future and Recommending to anyone who likes movies as it truly is a piece of art that can be enjoyed Or appreciated by anyone. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my review, sorry if it is a bit general but just... cmon see the movie you won't regret it! ( By the way I totally haven't had to search up Taika Waititi's name about 10 times while writing this review)"
"daithiosioradain","10","2","5","13 January 2020"," Hugely Enjoyable yet with some poignant moments.
","Entertaining, stimulating, evocative, anti-war this unusual film engages from the start and never flags all the way. A terrific soundtrack combines with a splashy palette and excellent performances all round to ostracise the Third Reich, racism and the folly of war. It manages to mix flashes of humour with some very sad and strong war imagery and a tremendously realistic and movingly tragic snapshot of what the Fall of Berlin would have looked like.
Recommended!"

","Whilst I respect the view of people that don't like the move I'd expect them to see more than just the trailer. It's a great movie that portraits the Germans in a less favourable light so I couldn't stop laughing, despite being German, in particular Adolf as the hero's best friend, in the young mans mind of course.<br/><br/>Moments of laughter are followed by sucker punch like moments of despair and sadness, but the essence for me is like the end of ""The Life of Brian"" always look at the bright side of life.

","Taika Waititi directs this dark comedy. The amazingly funny film revolves around a little boy who thinks he's a nazi, but finds a girl living in his walls, and he might be wrong about his choice of politics. Jojo Rabbit has a couple of gruesome images, including a bloody hand and a graphic wound on Hitler's head. There are a few swear words, including the f word right at the end. There are no scary scenes, but there are a few intense scenes. Some scenes are severely depressing."

","There are so many movies out there these days, but so few films. This was a film and brilliant one at that. Whereas films like Once Upon A Time in Hollywood seem so smug and self congratulatory, this film is made with pure unaffected passion and heart. Brilliant performances from the cast, great sets, cinematography, costumes, direction, soundtrack and creative writing. The audience is not spoon fed information like in Marvel movies, but instead brought on a ride and free to go where imagination takes us...
This movie knows exactly what satire should be and if you don't, you might want to look up the definition before you see this. Or just go watch a formulaic marvel or self righteous movie like OUATinHollywood, instead."

12A
director: Taika Watiti
starring: Roman griffin Davis, Scarlett johanson,Rebel Wilson,Stephan Merchant,Thomasin Mckenzie,Taika Watiti,Archie Yates, Sam Rockwell etc.<br/><br/>overall rating 89/100<br/><br/>Jojo rabbit was truly excellent. something different. And offers a perfect blend of humour and drama in a clever and thoughtful way lets talk about this deeper.<br/><br/>My first positives would be the films humour and blending genres and tackling sensitive topics. The film was absolutely hilarious. The fact that it was a satire on nazi germany and hitler made the film more funny as you felt like you shouldn't laugh but thats what the film wants you to do. Rebel wilson got given fantastic material here and was fantastic and hilarious, her wit and sarcasm was fantastic to watch and she made me laugh almost every time she was on screen. But it also blended the genres of drama and comedy as well, with an equal amount of humour and serious/ emotional scenes so this was handled very well, including tackling sensitive topics such as the attitudes towards jews,public hangings and the harsh brutalities of war.<br/><br/>Next the film's performances were great, with key standouts and great chemistry between characters. The whole cast did fantastic performance, with both the humour and the drama showing true versatility with everyone. My key standouts were definitely Roman Griffin Davis and Scarlett johansson. Who had excellent chemistry as a mother and son, who have conflicting views but a deep love for one another. Scarlet did a phenomenal job of being the voice of reason for peace for the war and making her son change her mind on the nazis and the jews, she was a very believable motherly character leading to some heartwarming scenes. And Roman did a surprisingly versatile and deep performance for such a young actor and i was very impressed, His portrayal of a young nazi being brainwashed into supporting the nazis was excellently executed.<br/><br/>My only negative that bought down the film slightly would be its slight tonal inconsistencies in the final act. The film slightly overused hitler as a imaginary friend for Roman's character. It worked at first but then got slightly overused and irritating towards the end. And the films occasional use of comedy when there was conflict in the war towards the end effected the impact of some scenes making the narrative slightly clunky.<br/><br/>My final two positives would be its excellent script and fantastic character arc for Roman Griffin Davis. The films script felt very modern and left a big impact on me. The characters saying that everyone is human and we are not all that different is very important in todays society and is a good message to spread for people. Finally Roman griffin Davies character arc throughout the film was excellent. To go from a brainwashed nazi kid to forming a connection with a jew and realising that they aren't any different to anyone else thanks to his mum was powerfully done. I respect the amount of depth to his character and his change of attitude towards what is right and wrong.<br/><br/>Overall Jojo rabbit is a powerfully acted thoughtful movie blending comedy and drama almost perfectly with it just losing its steam towards the end. But still a fantastic movie."
"skjoe-1","9","2","5","8 January 2020"," Bizarre and brilliant.
","It's hard to define the genre of Taika Watiti's JoJo Rabbit, it's a comedy, drama, War story and sort of satire rolled into one.
The film shifts from having actors play over the top caricatures of nazi stereotypes to a tense stand-off between the SS and a Jewish girl pretending to be German to avoid certain death.
Sprinkled through this mashup of genres is Taika's daring style, for a film set in 1940s Germany there's plenty of colour, slow motion and visual humour. The script has an almost improvised feel to it, with some actors verging onto a cartoonish feel, however fans of his work so far should know what to expect.
The stand out performances for me where Scarlett Johansson as JoJo's mother. A face of optimism in Germany's approaching defeat and the voice of reason for our main character. Taika himself plays Adolf Hitler, well JoJos imaginary friend version of Adolf Hitler. He mainly provides absurd comic relief with his whacky behaviour.
There's enough sublte references to the Nazi regime that will provide the extra laughs for the keen eyed, however JoJo Rabbit's story gradually shifts at such a pace that it catches you off guard when the genre goes into a more serious drama. The humour is still there but there's only so long a family hiding a Jew in Germany before the repercussions come forward.
Overall this movie is a definite watch, part comedy part drama sprinkled with Taika Watiti's wonderful originality."

But it's not just a comedy. When **that** happens, the fact that the audience was completely unprepared for it gives it the impact of a physical blow. A superb performance from young Roman Griffin Davis as a child trying to make sense of a mad world. But is the **law** to include a comedy fat kid?"

"eelen-seth","10","3","10","16 December 2019"," Unapologetically brave
","A film in which an imaginary Adolf Hitler is played by a Polynesian Jew? Only one person has the balls to pull this off. Taika Waititi's anti-hate satire makes fun of nazi-Germany and its hitlerjugend in his newest film, Jojo Rabbit. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis),a teenage boy who wants to become the best fascist there is and belong to something bigger than life, joins a youth camp that trains young boys and girls to become better Germans. The camp gets run by one-eyed Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who spends his time sketching fabulous capes and designing new outrageously camp weapons. With him we get his loyal righthand Finkel (Alfie Allen) and his loud lefthand Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson).<br/><br/>When Jojo tries to prove himself to the older bullish camp guide counsellors, things don't go exactly as planned and the young boy ends up wounded back home. With his face now looking like a Picasso painting - it's really not that bad - he's afraid to go out into the light of day and would rather spend his days getting pep talks from his good friend Adolf (played by Taika Waititi himself). Bright spirit Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) has other plans and pushes her son to take on the dangerous world that waits for him. But when Jojo comes home sooner than expected, he finds something every Nazi fears the most, a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home.<br/><br/>The sweet humour seems strange when dealing with a subject matter like this, but fans of Taika's work know he's done weirder things. After critically acclaimed films such as 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and 'Thor: Ragnarok', the New Zealand director is ready to take on awards season and does so in a very provocative but extremely balanced style. It is a satire and makes fun of bending the truth into a way it becomes enjoyable, yet the film builds up to an emotional third act that feels as bittersweet as it is heartwarming.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story) surprises with a certain flair and joyful theatricality we haven't seen from her in a while. Not since Ghost World in 2001, has she done something this funny and edgy. It's a welcome return to form and hopefully post-'Avengers: Endgame', she keeps on track with these interesting and unique roles. Charming newcomer Roman Griffin Davis knows how to carry the entire film. This is his story, and the way Waititi wrote his character to grow over the course of almost two hours will resonate with audiences who sometimes just don't know better and take the truth for granted. His young and promising co-star Thomasin McKenzie (Leave No Trace), who plays Jewish stowaway Elsa, is perfectly synced with him. Their dialogue and emotional arc grows from Jojo asking if she sleeps upside down like a bat - because that's what Jews do - to fully embracing the fact she's human and fills a void in his family's house, which has been empty for such a long time.<br/><br/>Composer Michael Giacchino's score is as brilliant as ever. He proves himself once again to be one of the most diverse and interesting composers in the business, bringing guitars and drums to 'Jojo's March', while a choir is angelically chanting in the background. The visually pleasing production design and use of colour in every scene is almost Wes Anderson-like, but with the heart of Taika Waititi. Jojo Rabbit is just the cheeky little film we didn't know we needed. An unapologetically brave reminder to face your fears and be resolute when speaking up against those who are wrong."

"sweidman-28016","8","3","10","17 November 2019"," Amazing Satire With a Great Message
","Jojo Rabbit Review:<br/><br/>
Jojo Rabbit is a World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic. Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism. Just by the plot synapsis, I don't know how anybody couldn't be interested. Also with Taika Waititi directing, writing, and staring it in, that makes it on a whole new level, which it is. I found myself having a great time throughout the film. I saw it at a 10:40 showing on a whim after a long day and it was worth it. The story is what hooked me right at the start. It dives right in from the beginning with the Nazi camp. It reminded me so much of Moonrise Kingdom with the style and the whole camp. I will add there was a little trouble with tone switching and that affected the story just a little at the beginning before getting to the main conflict of Scarlett Johansson's character hiding a Jewish girl in their house. The story is good at the beginning but the tone had a little awkwardness to it. The acting is very strong in here as well. Obviously Taika Waititi portrays a good Hitler. Very comical and being like him. I'd push for him to get nominated for best supporting actor, but that category is pretty full at the moment. The other supporting character, Johansson, is also really strong. I'd say this is my favorite performance that I've seen from her and I'd push for her for the nomination as well, but it's also a tight race for that category. Her character had so much to say to spread a good message. All of her likes me at so much. Also her character was kind of crazy, in a good way, which made for such an entertaining watch. The way she raises Jojo, played by the marvelous Roman Griffin Davis, and their relationship was my favorite aspect. Just all the relationships in general I should add. I'm just amazed that this was Davis's first time acting in a film. I can see a Golden Globe nomination in his future. But by far the best performance, which I didn't expect, came from Thomasin McKenzie. I just wish people would talk about her more. Every scene from her was practically flawless. Just her character in general made me smile from her wittiness and feel sad for her situation. Personally she has had one of the best performances of the entire year. The film is very good with its humor. Many people have been worried beforehand that it would be offensive, but somehow they never cross the line with it. Rebel Wilson has a smaller role and she makes joke all the time. I thought she was hilarious and good at providing humor. Alongside Wilson is Sam Rockwell and he was pretty funny as well but more serious, especially as the film progresses. So there's a point, about a little over halfway through, where the tone switches completely to very serious. I went from laughing to basically on the verge of tears. At that point the film really soared and I didn't want it to end. So much happened and that was it's strong part, story-wise. It managed to get back to the satire part in a good way to provide some levity to the dark situation. The film really ended perfectly. I couldn't ask for a better ending to this. For the technicalities and all of that, the cinematography was really good. It captured everything in a unique way, at least I thought, and the amazing production design. I will riot if the production design isn't nominated for anything. The score had that camp sound to it, once again very similar to Moonrise Kingdom. Overall Jojo Rabbit is a beautiful film. There's a few flaws here and there but it soars. I think with the strong message and the popularity of it, there's a strong chance of it winning best picture. It's a little hard at the moment since there's not a strong front runner, which is a good sign, but I consider it a strong front runner. Definitely see this if you get the chance. I don't know how anyone could be disappointed.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"

","Described as a satire on hate. ""Jojo Rabbit"" follows a Hitler Youth who finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their attic. He must then question his beliefs, while dealing with the intervention of his imaginary friend, an idiotic version of Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>""Jojo Rabbit"" exceeded my expectations in both it's comedic pacing and gut-punching heart and reality. The blending of the two worked so well, which was heightened by the solid acting all around. Child acting can be very hit-or-miss, but both of our lead kids were fantastic! It also helps that Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo is literally one of the cutest child actors I've ever seen. I hope to see more from this kid soon! I find Scarlett Johansson to be very hit-or-miss as well, but this may be one of my favorite performances of hers to date. The chemistry shown between her and Jojo's character was so heartwarming and refreshing. The big reveal in the film completely blindsided me once I saw those shoes, I gasped out loud as did my friend next to me. That doesn't happen often. She did what she could.<br/><br/>We got some Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen exchanged looks and sensual spoon feeding which was something I didn't think I'd ever see in film. But it was pretty great! We also cannot talk about this film without acknowledging the greatness that was Taika Waititi. He directed the film and wrote the screenplay. He also plays Hitler in this film and damn did he kill it. Him doing all of that just makes me respect him so much more as a creator. The film also looked great as well, wanted to mention that because it shouldn't be overlooked.<br/><br/>The film is over the top and enjoyable. It will probably go on my list of favorites from this year. I still don't quite understand the unicorn meal Hitler was eating during one scene, but that's probably just me being dumb. I also questioned Jojo being allowed to live alone and what happened to his father. Though I could've missed that last bit. I hope audiences understand the film and appreciate it for what it is."

","Jo Jo Rabbit is extremely funny and very emotionally heartfelt. The directing is amazing by Taika Waititi who also plays a hilarious yet very overtop Hitler. The story is also really sweet has a really good message on top of all the dark humor. All of the acting is great especially with all of the kids and of course Scarlet Johansen as the mother. Like I already stated the humor is really good dose a good job lightening up the mood especially towards the end of the movie when it gets really intense. Even the set design is good doing a great job making it look and feel like Nazi Germany during world war two. As for the one flaw I do have with the movie it is that the film could have used maybe one more emotional punch and maybe a little more closure to the story towards the end though the film still is very emotional at times. Overall JO JO Rabbit is a great film with great humor and with a story that will emotionally pull on your heartstrings especially for JO Jo's relationship with his mother and the Jewish girl they are hiding."
"smichaellutz","2","7","34","24 November 2019"," Nazi satire should be more accurate in its point
","To think that ""knowing"" people make you like them is wrong and absurd. Jews in Germany were completely integrated into the society in the 30s. If the point of this movie were true why did most survivors choose to go to refugee camps instead of back ""home""? This is why Israel got statehood. Does the writer-creator think Steven Miller and Steve Bannon don't know Jewish people? In fact Breitbart's banker Mercer is ostensibly Jewish, who seems to be okay fanning the flames of hatred to gain whatever they are trying to gain. Do we think that gay-haters never knew gay people? We all have known and seen LGTBQ people all our lives and they are still generally not respected. This movie might be funny if it wasn't so ridiculously wrong. But there are ""good people on both sides"", including the Nazi marchers in the US who chanted about ""Jews"" the night before with their brown shirts. I guess I just need to get to be better friends with some of them."

I mean really, there are people who fill their calendars with the opening dates of war movies?<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a twist on the stereotypical European setting Nazi war movie where they focus of a few individuals instead of the mass horror that took place. Whoever keeps paying to have these annual Nazi movies produced needs to stop, the last one I went to was Inglorious Basterds and that was it for me.

He followed this light. By the time he reaches it, he begun to know that loyalty without love is fire without flame. Waititi (T) directs like he acts. Wherever you have Wilson (R) you have fun. Jojo Rabbit is the motion for our emotions."

","The movie has a lot of Waititi brilliance, and imaginary Adolf is completely original and inspired. While the book Caging Skies is one htefest of crazed feminist misandry especially in its second half, which Waititi did not even read, he made best out of the source material that did not deserve to be honored by his great talents in fact. Interestingly, the book steals much from the Underground of Kusturica, and other Balkan inspirations are responsible for this little movie gem - from Tito and Me, another take on imaginary dictator friend, to Waititi admitting reading about wars in the Balkans to give the human touch to the story. For atroc ities and other ills, he had a lot of experience with the Brits, and na zi rallies to Beatles music seem like a perfect fit, as does the casting of some pretty ug ly inside and out Brit characters. Some humanity Waititi sees also in Germans, most notably the complex Sam Rockwell character, one of the heroes of the movie. Overall Waititi's faith in humanity shines through and he manages to distance himself from the pretty repugnant source ""book"" luckily the first half of which did offer such opportunity with a lot of input from the Jewish-Maori genius."

"rhmacl","10","3","11","11 November 2019"," A satire that will not disappoint
","This film threads a fine satirical fiber through a sensitive needle's eye, bringing a new perspective, and relevance to the ramifications of ignorance; fascism, suffering, trauma. It deploys the most adorable face and character ever brought to the screen, making the story accessible to new generations while retaining a modicum of dignity and respect. There is no doubt that the truth is far graver than depicted in this film, though horrific, the warmth from the characters belies the depth of the pain and suffering. But, it does so knowingly, from the first scene, with a Beatle's song, that reminds you that this film will not be a serious one. Instead, it is whimsical, and obviously drawn from the imagination of one with only second-hand understanding of WW2. But it checks many fantasy scenarios that have occupied wandering minds of the generations of people who followed the one that actually dealt with the scourge of the Nazi party, and other movements that resemble it. It reminds us of the simple fact that war is senseless, in an off-beat though endearing manner. It is always refreshing to hear familiar stories told by those with diverse perspectives because it reassures us of our value system's credentials by revealing just how universally accepted are the fundamental principles of respect, dignity, justice, and trust."

","I love movies and I love writing movie reviews. I'm not going to write a review of ""Jojo Rabbit."" I'm just going to say, ""Go see Jojo Rabbit."" This movie made me and the person I saw it with laugh, cry, and think. It's the best theatrical-release movie I've seen in 2019, and 2019 is almost over. It's audacious, courageous, moving, unforgettable, original, deeply human, and it gets under your skin. Reward this kind of filmmaking with your ticket-buying dollars.<br/><br/>""Jojo Rabbit"" is about a ten-year-old Hitler Youth member living in a German city during the waning days of World War II. He's just a child so he has swallowed Nazi ideology whole. He has an imaginary friend: Adolf Hitler. Jojo lives with his mother, and he attends Hitler Youth meetings.<br/><br/>Making a comedy about Nazism is a tough task. Many have tried and failed. One false move and this movie would be splat all over the floor. There are no false moves. ""Jojo Rabbit"" is supremely confident. It moves like a well-oiled machine. I don't want to say much more because I want you to be surprised and delighted as I was.<br/><br/>I can say the performances are terrific. I found Sam Rockwell, as a Hitler Youth commander, to be particularly compelling. His final scene in this film is one that will stay with me for a long time.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother ripped my heart right out of my chest. Rebel Wilson is hysterically funny. Thomasin McKenzie has the gravity of a veteran performer twice her age, and when she finally smiles an innocent, little girl smile it tugs at your heart. Archie Yates, as Jojo's fat friend, is adorable. The tall, thin, pale man who played the Gestapo commander is appropriately terrifying and also funny.<br/><br/>This may have been a low-budget movie but the production values are high. The interiors send you back in time eighty years. Scarlett Johansson wears a green art-deco sweater I wanted to reach through the screen and borrow, and maybe never return.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi as Hitler is, at first, simply funny. But then there's a scene where he really unleashes, and it's terrifying. It's clear that Waititi has watched video of Hitler giving speeches and managed to mimic every crazed, hate-mongering gesture.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. Please. And you're welcome."

","This satirical comedy(?) is definitely an unique take to the war, through the eyes of a young boy. However, while Waititi's comedic touch was a welcoming addition to Thor Ragnarok, it did not work so well in this film.<br/><br/>Due to its outrageous but family friendly tone which keeps jumping from one to another, I find it hard to approach this film in the right manner to perhaps get the most out of it. It felt like the film was trying to find the fine balance between solemnity and comedy throughout but never achieved it. This inconsistency made me invest in the main characters less and made me wonder if there was indeed any hidden story morals at all to take out from.<br/><br/>That being said, this film has strong casts, with Scarlet and Roman standing out the most. So kudos to them.<br/><br/>The whole atmosphere of this film feels more like a spin off or an abridged version of something greater, I feel like it is too casual and forced for its own good, especially when related to the second world war.<br/><br/>All in all, a good popcorn flick with a somewhat heart warming ending with a message or two. By no means the over hyped masterpiece that others make it out to be in my opinion. Chances are you will either like it or not depending on your take on its tone."

I'm actually really glad they took a younger-generations perception of the times in Germany during the war. Made everything more realistic and relatable, because sadly a large part of the fascist movement was lead by ignorant child-like populism and indoctrination was just a part of everyday life where everyone was expected to act a certain way and speak/think through blind-fanaticism.<br/><br/>The illustration of war from a childs' perspective and the inclusion of some of the grossest details of war being portrayed in a comedic/satirical sense was just amazing.<br/><br/>One of the most capturing moments for me was when it came down to the Nazis strapping grenades to children in a last-ditch effort to kill as many people as possible, and that woman says ""Just shoot anyone that looks different than you.""
That is why the world went to war against this ideology.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it more the second time around..

Johansson has rarely been better and is totally convincing as the loving German mother, whilst young Griffin Davis gives the best child actor turn since Jacob Tremblay in Room. The supporting cast are also integral to the humour with Rockwell fine as the German captain who likes the strange boy, Merchant hilarious and sinister as the local Gestapo head and best of all Archie Yates as the boy's best friend.<br/><br/>Not for everyone to be sure, but a terrific film destined for cult following."

"thetyvonlesure","8","2","6","23 December 2019"," A Charming Coming of Age Story
","Jojo Rabbit is a film about a ten year old Nazi sympathizer befriending a Jewish girl, after finding her hiding in his house. Jojo is tasked with learning the meaning of friendship and family, while fluctuating between childhood and a premature adulthood. Jojo Rabbit is based on the book, Caging Skies by Christine Leunens. The film stars Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother, Thomasin Mackenzie as Elsa, the Jewish girl Jojo meets, and Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson as Jojo's Nazi superiors. The film is directed by Taika Waititi, who also portrays Jojo's imaginary manifestation of Hitler. The film successfully fluctuates between comedy and drama. The tone of the film is perfect.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is fantastic. The brightest star in the film is Scarlett Johansson. Her portrayal of Jojo's mother is wondrous. Jojo's mother is a cinematically special character whose wisdom is akin to Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid. Jojo's mother nurtures the movie and adds serious dialogue where it is needed. She serves as the voice of reason within the film. Her relationship with Jojo is beautifully written, and poetic. Scarlett Johansson was perfect for the role. Roman Griffin Davis does an excellent job in portraying Jojo. He is a curious kid who does not fully have a grasp of his reality. Jojo's character development is well written, as it toys with the juxtaposition of childhood and adulthood. Initially, Jojo's circumstance is that of a child, but he feels that he's an adult. As life changing events occur within the film, Jojo's character is tasked with circumstances of adulthood, while Jojo realizes that he is a child lost in the middle of war. Jojo's character development is brilliant. The rest of the cast is great as well. Sam Rockwell's portrayal of Captain Klenzendorf is another bright spot. His German accent is spot on. Despite Captain Klenzendorf's heinous crimes as a Nazi soldier, he is still presented with a sense of humanity. He serves as a father figure for Jojo. His love for Jojo is real, and it adds to the heart of the film. Generally, the casting was amazing.<br/><br/>The writing within this film is really good. As the story progresses, it shifts from a family comedy into a family Drama. Jojo's struggle between his humanity, social awareness, and support for the Nazi party is the primary conflict. Jojo's friendship with Elsa progresses really well throughout the film. Jojo is a child filled with hate. As he grows within the film, he becomes stricken with love. The film accurately portrays the decline of Nazi Germany, in lieu of World War 2 and their heinous crimes against humanity.<br/><br/>The direction of the film is great. Taika Waititi is a master of comedy. Foremost, his portrayal of Hitler is humorous in the sense of parody. He portrays the Nazi party as weak idiots throughout the film, as opposed to portraying them as mighty protagonists. Taika's portrayal of Hitler is lead by hilarious one-liners. Despite Nazi's being his protagonists, he captures their true nature as human garbage. Cinematically, the film is good. There's nothing groundbreaking about the cinematography. The callbacks to previous scenes is great. The film's set pieces are well done, and the grim colorization is useful in conveying the absence of freedom within Nazi Germany. There's one particular scene that is well shot and unforgettable. Jojo chases a blue butterfly, leading into a shocking reveal. The music within the film is good. The German dub of certain songs is really cool. The film's biggest flaw comes from not knowing who its audience is. Jojo is a child protagonist suitable for a rated PG or G film. His environment is incredibly graphic and borderline R Rated. At times the film feels too child-like, or too adult oriented.<br/><br/>Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a great movie that is very charming, fun, and emotional. It's a great coming of age story that successful captures the innocence of childhood, while juxtaposing the harsh realities of adulthood."
"Kenbo17","8","2","6","20 December 2019"," This film inspired me to write my first review.

Bored with nothing much else to do I went to see this movie with hopes of sitting through a mediocre comedy at best just to pass the time. What I got though was far more than I expected. JoJo Rabbit reminds me of films like Shaun of the Dead who promise of pure comedy is bundled with a gift drama. I like nothing better than a comedy that can make you cry without taking itself too seriously. I give this movie a strong 8 as I was a pleasant surprise."
"jadepietro","8","2","6","24 November 2019"," A Comedy Used as a Weapon of Mass Destruction
","GRADE: B<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A flawed but memorable dark satire about Nazism.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: It so hard to make a Nazi comedy. The sheer subject of their heinous acts of brutality shown in satirical terms is off-putting from the start. Even with decades between WWII and the present day rise of white supremacy and hate crimes, the pain and cruelty is not easily forgotten, nor should it be. This is not to say that using comedy as weapon is a new approach. And now. some eighty five years later, we have Jojo Rabbit taking direct aim at the Hitler regime.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi wrote, directed and starred in this independent film and while his intent is admirable, his execution is slightly flawed. As a director, he creates many memorable scenes with powerful images that carry with them a rare beauty and insight. At times, there is sheer brilliance in his vision, as with his opening credit sequence which mixes anachronistic lyrics of the Beatles' Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand, sung in German, with actual Nazi archival footage showing the mass hysteria of a mob mentality. But at other times, he wallows in sentimentality and the obvious targets of blundering Nazis.<br/><br/>As a screenwriter, his coming-of-age tale about a young impressionistic Hitler youth living with his widowed mother and dealing with an imaginary friend named Adolf has an intriguing premise. He layers his narrative with bittersweet moments and comical conflict. We meet a 10 year old boy caught up in a nationalistic frenzy whose bedroom walls are covered with pro-Nazi propaganda rather than sport figures or movie idols, a telling sign. Something is amiss in Johann. He is an enigma, a child soldier who will parrot the hate speech he is carefully taught but yet sensitive enough to discover the beauty of that aforementioned solitary blue butterfly flitting through his war-torn village. But Mr. Waititi's dialog lacks substantial power, some of the comedy elements are broad slapstick and don't work, and most of his supporting characters are cliche-ridden stock types. Also, story-wise, the plot loses its logical path with a plot twist that comes unexpectedly midway through the film and has some trouble recovering from it. Still there is so much to admire due to his filmmaking skills and the fine photography by Mihai Malaimare Jr.<br/><br/>As an actor, Mr. Waititi is effective. Yet he never captures the goofiness and comic edge of Der Fuhrer, which is a minor misstep in this pivotal role. His interpretation should have been more outlandish and farcical. He just doesn't show the menace or the charisma. His character annoys rather than enthralls. Perhaps another actor would have been a better choice and would have given him some distance in this filmmaker trifecta.<br/><br/>However, Roman Griffin Davis in the title role is excellent. Perfectly cast, this young actor gives one of the most natural performance by a child ever filmed and his portrayal of a boy coming to terms with the insane world around him is quite moving. His expressive face conveys a child learning war games but unable to tie his own shoes. Thomasin McKenzie plays Elsa, a Jewish girl hiding in Jojo's house and she has a nice chemistry with Mr. Davis. Scarlett Johansson provides some tender moments as Rosie, Jojo's loving mother. The reliable Sam Rockwell tries to add some depth in his sketchy role as is Captain Klenzendorf, an Army officer in charge of a Hitler Youth camp, but Rebel Wilson as his assistant can't keep her German accent straight, let alone find the essence of her role. Stephen Merchant delivers the creepiness as a Gestapo agent and Archie Yates brings some wonderful comic timing as Jojo's clumsy friend, Yorki.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is another reworking of the sum of its parts being better than the whole. Nevertheless, the film remains a welcome and strong indictment to hatred with Mr. Waititi definitely a talent to watch. His film uses comedy as a lethal weapon and it lands mainly on target. This reviewer look forward to his next venture and so should any serious moviegoer.Comedy as a Weapon of Mass Destruction"

To mention that ""Jojo Rabbit"" won't be for everyone is an understatement. This Nazi-mocking satire tests all boundaries of what is right and wrong but with its heart in the right place.

","Point blank periodt, I believe this movie is on the verge of setting an unhealthy precedent for comedy in regards to what content is on and off limits. That being said this film was brilliantly executed from the gorgeously detailed cinematography and a stunning performance by all actors. Jojo's antihero complex serves his audience in a very raw and specific way.

"spotboyfilms","8","2","6","8 November 2019"," A tragic comedy
","JoJo Rabit is certainly to be divisive in audience response. The beginning is hard to swallow because of how lightly the film handles the evils of Naziism, but once you get used to the characters and the premise, it gets easier. Different Genres are blended together quite well and seem to be Waititi's trademark. Some scenes were very powerful, and shows the potential that Waititi has, but a lot of other great moments are undercut or bookended by Comedy, which is also Waititi's trademark. It is certainly a very different film and can be funny and serious at the same time. I would suggest checking it out, but be ready for some real gut punches."
"TheVictoriousV","7","2","6","8 November 2019"," While imperfect, Jojo Rabbit does what too few modern comedies do
","I've recently read that Disney were disquited that a black comedy satirizing Nazi Germany would alienate modern audiences. I can imagine it, I suppose. One side might be offended by the mere sight of Nazi iconography - regardless of context or intent - while the other side (let's face it) has a few factions which feel attacked when a film portrays overtly Nazi or Nazi-inspired figures as evil. Disney sure has come a long way since The F√ºhrer's Face.<br/><br/>I seem to recall, also, that people foresaw a success from Jojo Rabbit, directed by Taika Waititi, who returns to the land of quirky comedy after peppering the superhero genre with it in Thor: Ragnarok. It seems, however, that its impact was pretty lukewarm. To me, it is a shame.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit does what too few modern comedies do, letting its visuals create almost as much of the humour as the satirical dialogue and performances - through editing, framing, strange title cards, and what-have-you. Almost every YouTube video essayist will cite The Cornetto Trilogy as the prime example, but Waititi also gets that a truly striking comedy will also be fun to look at. We need more than just comedians being themselves in front of a camera, lest we see more insipid Schumer vehicles √† la last year's I Feel Pretty.<br/><br/>Waititi himself plays Adolf Hitler, or at least how he appears to a young 1940's Hitler Youth lad named Johannes (Roman Griffin Davis), who just doesn't know any better. This Adolf is a childish imaginary friend, because how bad could Hitler really be if most of the nation admires him?<br/><br/>The supporting cast provides more flare than they might have done in a more mainstream film, even if we mostly know them as the modern greats, including Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson, the latter playing Jojo's single mother (the father, we're told, is serving in Italy but is rumored to be a deserter and disgrace). Stephen Merchant is an amusing choice as the leader of a Gestapo group, Rebel Wilson made me chuckle more than usual as a Hitler Youth counselor, and Thomasin McKenzie (get this) plays a Jewish girl whom Jojo eventually has to hide in his house.<br/><br/>As I said at the top, this film might also irritate both sides of the aisle for different reasons. Someone might whine that laughing at a Holocaust comedy means you would also laugh if said historical event were to repeat itself. Someone like Armond White might wonder why the movie didn't make fun of fans of the Obama administration instead.<br/><br/>More legitimate complaints involve the film being ""declawed"" as far as black comedy goes, and that it doesn't necessarily confront the ideology behind the Third Reich with much depth or vitriol, nor are they satisfied with its parallels to present-day political idolatry and xenophobia. Many critics feel that the comedy largely comes down to ""Hey, look, it's Hitler but he's acting all goofy"".<br/><br/>Fortunately for Waititi, some might be offended either way (see above). And a lot of us will no doubt laugh. He's a particular type of weirdo, that Taika, successfully turning something awful and serious into something outstandingly wacky. He is funny enough in the role, too. Alas, the next Chaplin he is not. Yet."

","I love Taika Waititi. Wilderpeople, Ragnarok, and now Jojo. I'm excited to see what he does with the episode of Mandalorian that he's directing. One other thing to get out of the way before reviewing. I don't like how this movie is being advertised like a Wes Anderson movie. The trailers make it seem like that but it's not that at all. It has plenty of silly but what Wes has that Taika is missing is the implied silly. Wes films have these silly moments but they don't stick out because they're so cleverly executed. With this movie... the Hitler imaginary friend seems a little odd at times.<br/><br/>I'm ranking this at 8 but I need to watch it again. I could see this easily being pushed to 9. When I first saw the trailer to this, it was an immediate want to watch for me. My main problem with the movie is perception. Through most of the movie, it was tough to decide if this should be funny or serious. Honestly, I think you could watch it in two ways. A funny-haha movie romp or a serious movie about a kid with ingrained hate and how things aren't always what they seem.<br/><br/>I consider this a must-see. I'm not sure if Taika meant for this to have a strong message but it definitely does. Not to sidetrack but Jojo having that hate ingrained by what's around him; I experienced that recently by my dad's girlfriend and her grandson. It was a disappointing moment seeing that happen in plain sight.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where this movie will sit in overall movie collections but I think it will definitely stick out as one of Taika's best."

"noalygh","9","1","2","7 April 2020"," Hysterical, ridiculous, heart-warming
","Jojo Rabbit is an immaculately funny, engaging and heart-felt movie that is able to transcribe love amid its glorifying theme of Nazi Germany in World War II. Written and directed by Taiki Waititi, he did a fantastic job in telling this story in a humorous and twisty way.<br/><br/>The movie follows the perspective of a 10-year-old boy in Hitler's youth, Johannes, who considers Hitler as his imaginary best friend. At Nazi camp, he is joyously exposed to dangerous German weapons. This later results in a grenade accident that made him stay back home with his mother, Rosie. Here, he discovers she is hiding a Jewish girl, whose name is Elsa, in their house. As a Hitler fanatic, he is urged to tell on her. However, afraid to jeopardize his mother's safety, he has to negotiate with her instead. Forced to spend time with Elsa, Jojo gets to know her a little bit. At first, Elsa hates Jojo and makes up facts about Jewish people. Naive 10-year-old Jojo believes all of this and proceeds to write a book about stereotypical Jewish traits viewed by the Nazis - hideous, scaly, horny and have evil superpowers to control people's mind.<br/><br/>One of the funniest bits of the film is when a group of Gustapos visits Jojo at his house, they all say ""Heil Hitler"" to Jojo, and he says ""Heil Hitler"" back. This gets even better when Captain K. visits the house later, then they all have to salute again. I also like how everyone in the movie, especially children, acts as ""over-the-top"" Nazis proud to kill Jews or die for Hitler. By this, the film is able to satirize and capitalize on its depiction of the ridiculousness and ignorance of people living under Nazi rule in the 1940s.<br/><br/>However, it also shows the side of more understanding and resistance under the system. Jojo's mother, Rosie, is an anti-Nazi herself; and Captain K., is sympathetic towards Jewish people. Ultimately, the movie speaks to one thing, that German people during this time period weren't evil sadists, they were simply so used to and brainwashed by all the Hitler propagandas. This movie effectively tells this through the perspective of children. Through Jojo's conversations with his friend Yorkie, he learns that Yorkie doesn't actually care about killing Jewish at all and was surprised that Jews are normal people who don't have horns and scales like textbooks say. This is perfectly expressed in Elsa's quote after Jojo tells her that he is a Nazi: ""You're not a Nazi, Jojo. You're a ten-year-old kid who likes dressing up in a funny uniform and wants to be part of a club"". This theme is fulfillingly wrapped up at the end, when Jojo eventually changes his beliefs about Jewish people and kicks Adolf out of his mind.<br/><br/>The illustration of love and relationships in the movie is also heart-warming and memorable. Jojo's arc mainly ties around two characters: Rosie and Elsa. We can see how close Rosie is to Jojo by her tying his shoes, going on bike rides, joking with him and imitating his father. Through the movie, Jojo gets closer and understands more about Elsa, so after feeling ""butterflies inside his stomach"", he has learned to sympathize and care for her. And in the time Jojo spends with his mother or Elsa, he finds love and forgets about his friend, Adolf.<br/><br/>A use of symbolism that I love about the film is the rabbit. In the beginning of the movie, at Nazi camp, Jojo fails to kill a rabbit when he is asked to do so. He is humiliated and then mocked as 'Jojo Rabbit' by other campers for being a weaky. After consulting with his friend Adolf, he changes his mind and proudly adopts the image of ""a rabbit"" himself. As Imaginary Adolf says, a rabbit is quick and lean for survival and can hide when needed. This rabbit turns out to be Elsa at the end. She has been in hiding in so many houses and lives more than she would have under Nazi rule, but she still survives when the war ends. Jojo learns that the Allies win, but he is afraid to tell Elsa because after his mother, he would lose her too. But when he flips the page of the sketch book and imagines the image of a magician opening the cage to let out the rabbit, he knows that he has to set Elsa free. Like they say, ""If you love something, you have to let it go"".<br/><br/>All of the actors did solid works for this film. Roman Davis Griffin did a fine job playing a young boy who is growing up confused and shaken by the challenges to his beliefs. Scarlett Johansson's performance goes on the spotlight, because she is exceptionally enchanting and loving as Jojo's mother but also a complicated character as an anti-nazi hiding a Jewish girl in Germany. Taiki Waititi as Imaginary Adolf is amazing, since he is absolutely childish and comical, that adds so much fun to the film by expressing the inner voice / state of mind of a ten-year-old. The only thing I wish more from the characters is for Thomasin MacKensie's Elsa to show more of her dynamics, as a Jewish in hiding for most of her adolescence, other than her love interest.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit gets a solid 9/10 on my scale. Without a doubt, it is one of the best films of 2019. As a family movie, it shines on its own with hysterical and over-the-top comedy, and beautiful, heart-warming moments. It is an impeccable treat to watch and think about."
"chengyiting","6","1","2","7 April 2020"," Great anti-war movie
","Looking at the deformed world in the eyes of children, all kinds of contradictions seemed ridiculous and unreasonable. ""Marriage Story"" and this film completely let Scarlett get rid of the vase. The pure color interpretation of foreign little Baizhi also made people shine. Although the supporting role with the little follower is not too much, but there are also highlights. The essence of the tragicomedy may be just the right one ..."
"kosmasp","10","1","2","7 April 2020"," Mein Film
","So Taika Waititi is an exceptional director and this is proof of that! I mean who'd take Hitler as an imaginary friend (source material is way more serious apparently, haven't read it) and not just run with it, no pun intended, but make a funny, engaging and heartfelt movie with it? Well the answer lies in front of you and is ready to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>Although to be fair, there is not just enjoyment and there are quite a lot of scenes here that will make you cringe to say the least. It is not just about showing violence for what it is (explicit), but also finding a balance with the humor. There is a let's everyone say ""Heil"" that seems to go forever, but the scene as akward as it is and seems, still works.<br/><br/>JoJo Rabbit has a few things that happen in the background or are not really talked about (see Sam Rockwell and his ... ""hidden"" love, which while obvious is never spoken out literaly) - there are so many little gems in this movie, handled with so much care and dignity, it really is amazing. I know and heard some be offended even before seeing it and never really plan to watch the movie - which is their loss I reckon, but better that way than being offended by something that is widely considered as being funny and as delicate as it can be"

"shettydeeksha-89874","10","1","2","1 April 2020"," Soul-stirring
","Jojo Rabbit is that one rare and a peerless movie that succeeds on almost every emotional level, where each character, scene, costume, and joke firing on all cylinders to make a film worth repeated viewings. Keeping aside all the technical aspects, what really had an impact was that every scene had something new for me to learn and apply that in my life. There were so many things that I could relate to.<br/><br/>The drawing scene in the end particularly, where the camera never leaves their faces, show how much they can convey with just a drawing, nothing but their eyelids, the flashing tension of neck muscles, and a barely cracking voice emphasizing the importance of freedom.<br/><br/>One such thing from the movie which moved me apart was: While Jojo's mum was around everything she said didn't make sense and when she dies everything makes sense and he happens to do and believe whatever she says, even things like dancing for freedom which he never liked doing. Which reminds me of things which we all have experienced in our lives is that ""You will realize the value of someone only when that someone is away from you""<br/><br/>All in all for me, Taika Waititi's Jojo Rabbit's every frame felt like a painting worth sitting in."
"snowfre","8","1","2","31 March 2020"," Despite some disappointment, a solid feel-good film
","""Jojo Rabbit"" was definitely one of the most talked about movies of 2019. It follows a young Hitler Youth member in the last months of World War II. Roman Griffin Davis makes an excellent performance as the film's title character, he does with so much heart and charm that I don't think anyone can't be touched by him. He also portrays little Jojo with conflicted feelings, as he's torn between his mother's (Johansson) efforts to hide a young Jewish girl (McKenzie) and his dreams of fighting for his nation, in a masterful way, many adult actors only could dream of. ""Jojo Rabbit"" has its ups and downs, director Waititi is funny as Jojo's imaginary friend version of the F√ºhrer himself, and the interactions between Jojo and Yorki (Yates) are often hilarious. The downs are also a few unfortunately. First of all, quite superficial - but still, the accents are unbearable. I get it, they wanted to be genuine but it fell short. Secondly, my main issue, the emotional impact of the film's events on the characters are not big enough. Halfway in, Jojo's mother is killed, and besides, Elsa doesn't ever know if her family is alive at all. ""Jojo Rabbit"" misses opportunities to hit its audience with an emotional blast, instead settling way to quickly for feel-good moments and quirky jokes. Nonetheless, Waititi's WW2 dramedy is filled with heartwarming moments and a very nice, hopeful ending, although it could have been a bit more attached to the - honestly - traumatic events the unlikely duo had been through."

The world needs more films that are willing to take risks."

","Wow! I loved this film. I'm not sure what I was expecting from Jojo Rabbit, but I got so much more than I could have hoped for. Taika Waititi is to be admired for taking on the subject matter and producing a film that is simultaneously hilarious, heartwarming and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Before saying anything else I have to applaud the performance of Roman Griffin Davis. This is one of the best child performances I've seen in a long long time, with his comedic timing and delivery both exceptional. Aside from a few dodgy German accents, the rest of the cast were also great. Waititi himself as the Fuhrer was inspired, providing some comedic moments that you won't be forgetting in a hurry.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit was so brazen and unapologetic in its satire, creating so many laughs. I'm not normally one to laugh out loud at films, however I couldn't stop myself belly laughing numerous times. The humour was such a delight and balanced so well with the more sobering elements. This contrast was so clever as the humour lulled me into a false sense of security, making the emotional punches all the more powerful.<br/><br/>The script was so sharp and intelligent and delivered expertly by the cast.<br/><br/>Through its comedic lense Jojo Rabbit told at its heart a very emotional story. A boy blinded by fanaticism and and Hitler's cult of personality, coming to terms with the fact that all he had blindly accepted may not be true. In this respect Jojo Rabbit was very original as I can't quite recall a comedy which packs such a punch while maintaining its hilarity.<br/><br/>Incredibly moving, funny, intelligent and surprising, Jojo Rabbit is a must watch, one of my favourite movies of recent years and one that I will constantly be returning to."

","Jojo is a 10 years old boy fanatic nazi, who's best friend is Adolf Hitler himself. That says a movie description and Jojo's mother. But we didn't see it at all. Jojo is just a kid, who likes swastikas and the idea of being nazi, but he never feels like one. You never ""buy"" it, because Jojo is so cute and fails in his first ""mission"" to kill a rabbit. In fact, all the Deutsches Jungvolk looks more like a scouts to me (maybe because of English language and american maniers). And because of it, we never feel a real fear and atrocities of Nazi ideology and war itself. Maybe the movie's idea was to show us that kids were just a kids even in Nazi Germany, I don't know, but I think the movie would be better if it's tone were more serious.<br/><br/>Should we use homour anyway? The themes like WW2 and the Holocaust are extremly serious. The humour could be used to show it's absurdity and insanity. The parody, sarcasm and irony are good tools to show it. But it's very difficult because the topic is so sensitive. Probably the best example of movie that succeed in it is R. Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful"". Also I would recommend to read amazing book ""The Forest of the Gods"" by Lithuanian author Balys Sruoga."

","Jojo Rabbit is a movie that offers a complete different perspective on war. It is the finest example of satire in latest years, even if it mock tragic events it manages still to be respectful. Instead of showing a realistic view World War 2, with gruesome scenes, director Taika Waititi decided to take a colorful direction, with close to no explicit violence. Little by little becomes darker, showing the tragedy of the war and how much sufference this can bring.<br/><br/>Photography is amazing, I like when directors go unconventional, and for some aspects the style reminded me a lot ""Grand Hotel Budapest"" and ""The King's Speech"", two movies that I have loved. Cast made an excellent job, especially Roman Davis, that was always on point with his german accent. I really liked the Adolf Hitler parody, very few interpretations were able to make me sincerely laugh so much. It is a nice example of comedy and a lot of people in the cinematography world, should take note.<br/><br/>Beware, Jojo Rabbit might seem a colorful and funny movie, but it has really important and inspiring message.

"CubsandCulture","5","1","2","24 February 2020"," This may be more me than the film but this film is way too hopeful. Humanity isn't innately good.
","I think I might like this film a little better if the jokes landed stronger. The humor is never cringe inducing but most of it never arises above dryly amusing. The best joke in the entire film is a dumb pun about German Shepherds and that is a sort of a big problem with the film. Farces like this require the material to be taken nearly on the subtextual level and JoJo Rabbit never properly gets there. The rest of the writing is too loose to be effective.<br/><br/>The film is way too saccharine on the possibility of change for people. JoJo's (character) entire story is a maturation plot mixed with a redemption plot. He stops being a Nazis because he grows up and meets a Jewish girl. The film stacks the deck in his favor to change. He's young. He finds the Jewish girl cute. The plot developments how Nazism treats his family all grease the wheels to get him to change. As far as that goes it's fine. It is keeping with the film's overall style and taken as farce it lands. But the film doesn't stop there.<br/><br/>Much of the problem stems from Captain Klenzendorf. Played by Hollywood's go to for a likable bigot, Sam Rockwell, this character's story needed to be removed or vastly re-written. He is given a fairly similar arch to JoJo. But his arch is truncated to the point it is unbelievable and worse undermines the uniqueness of JoJo's escape from Nazism. When viewed in context this character makes the film too sunny. Most people do not escape their ideological trappings. (There is also a weird queering of Klenzendorf to try to sell the change as he too was a victim of the Nazis but that rises other issues).<br/><br/>The film isn't in bad taste. It just has a blinkered and naive view of human nature."

The young Jojo daydreams about Adolf Hitler who is played by director Taika Waititi. The supporting cast are excellent and include Scarlet Johansson, Rebel Wilson, Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant.<br/><br/>The movie was obviously a labour of love for Waititi and it's good that he pulled it off so well.

"zhenwenho","9","1","2","10 February 2020"," Joy, pain, and love
","A quick overview on what this movie is, well it is indeed a satire comedy regarding the Nazi regime taking place towards the end of the war. This is such a heartfelt movie with clever humour that hits you right at the core due to the of course one and only Taika Waititi. However, at it's core it tells a story that I think has been a trend these days which is an anti-war movie which doesn't shove it in your face like a certain Maleficent: Mistress of Evil did but instead it shows it through the lens of a child and the effect it has on the people around the child.<br/><br/>So, beginning with the acting, I think everybody absolutely nailed their role within the movie and they were all incredibly outstanding and this includes those given supporting roles within the movie. However, the spotlight is on the three main characters which are Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie), and Rosie Betzler (Scarlett Johannson) whom were all well flashed out characters in which the incredible screenplay by the director/actor, Taika Waititi together with their incredible acting talent gives the audience an opportunity to love these characters where each significant moment within the movie provides an impactful impact whilst experiencing this movie through and through. Roman Griffin Davis to me is a rising star in the movie industry and with so much talent at such a young age, he is definitely one to watch in the future. Furthermore, Thomasin McKenzie whom starred in another movie I watched, The King, was also great in the film but just in case you have not seen the later trailers, I shall stop there regarding her role within the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing which is kind of related to the acting but not really would be the chemistry amongst the main stars which brings a heartfelt performance to the screen. Shockingly, you actually grow to have a liking towards a certain Sam Rockwell towards the end of the movie which is something odd as he portrays a nazi. But hey, that shows the power of screenwriting and amazing characters.<br/><br/>Another thing I adored about this movie is obviously, the cinematography, this movie looks gorgeous, especially the colour gradient in every scene; from the cozy colours within the confines of the house, to the beautiful coulouful town of well Praque to be fair but yes. It's just so well filmed. A scene in particular that I grew a fond off is the scene whereby Jojo looks through what is a cardboard cutout and I thought that scene looked beautiful.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is really funny with some hits at the Nazi ideology and how ridiculous they were, I believe that the best way to show that you do not fear an individual is by making fun of them as nobody is scared of an individual that is a joke to everyone in the room; which I think is what Taika Waititi mentioned within an interview he did regarding the movie but I can't seem to find the quote but yes, this statement is absolutely correct and this movie does not deserve the bashing it got from certain critics in which this is the same issue many had when it came to critics condemning Joker.<br/><br/>So, yet again a well deserved Oscar award to Mr. Taika Waititi, it is an amazing movie with a really good adapted screenplay whic technically brought me to tears a couple of times. Just pure good stuff."

"justinwfirestone","6","1","2","4 February 2020"," Worth fighting through the first hour
","Jojo Rabbit is summed nicely in a single word, which is ""divisive."" The first hour is an uncomfortable cringe-fest, asking the audience to self-assess the reasons why cinema even exists as an art form. Some natural questions arise, such as whether Jojo Rabbit really was based on a book (it was), whether it is appropriate to portray Adolf Hitler as a bumbling stooge with separation issues (not sure, but the first hour had me leaning toward a ""hell, no""), and whether we'll be able to see Alfie Allen in anything after Game of Thrones and not think of sausages (probably not).<br/><br/>The first hour is a bit of torture, thankfully saved by the second hour, which turns the movie into something at least enjoyable. Taika Waititi gets to gobble up some scenery with some truly funny lines, but the best performances come from an amazingly daft Rebel Wilson as some kind of Nazi staffer Fraulein Rahm who likes guns and war far too much, and even better is an incredibly goofy Archie Yates as Yorki, who appears at all the right moments to deliver several good laughs.<br/><br/>This, then, is the divisive point: would it not have been a better movie if it had been Yorki Rabbit, or at least investigate the concept of Yorki and Rahm."
"sebastianschlicht","9","1","2","3 February 2020"," ""Be the rabbit!"" -An enchanting and crazy satire!
","New Zealand's Taika Waititi made a name for itself in 2017 with its MCU film ""Thor Ragnarok"", even if he was very busy in the film industry before. His humorous style was well received and I liked it too. Finally, a heart project of his came to the big screen: ""Jojo Rabbit"". Loosely based on the novel ""Caging Skies"" by Christine Leunen, Waititi shows a satirical but touching look at the end of the Second World War and the world of fascism. A film like ""Jojo Rabbit"" will certainly not please everyone, after all the topic is still anything but simple today, but I fell in love with this work, if I'm honest and can't wait to see this film again!<br/><br/>Germany 1945: The end of the Second World War is imminent, but the Hitler Youth is still on the march. For little Johannes Betzler (Jojo), this is his biggest dream. His idol, who would have guessed it, is Adolf Hitler himself. So much so that he imagines the F√ºhrer as an imaginary friend ...<br/><br/>As always, I take the view that one should go into the film without a trailer or a synopsis. The film is a satirical drama and I was a little disappointed afterwards that I saw the trailer because a lot of events are revealed. Of course, I will not do that here and try to be vague with the details of the story.<br/><br/>""Jojo Rabbit"" primarily serves as a satire. An imaginary Hitler who is friends with Jojo? That sounds a little crazy, but it¬¥s more complex than expect. This applies to a lot in the film. The often coarse but also astute humor in the film initially seemed out of place or too modern for me (at least in the beginning). And even if I would have liked to reduce it a tiny bit, Waititi's satire element works wonderfully in the context of Jojo and his view of Hitler & Co. It is much less about the Nazis and their shameful acts than about dealing with themselves, the subject of fascism and what it actually means. For Jojo, for example, it means being part of a gang, being part of something bigger, which certain books like ""Die Welle"" have shown wonderfully. But ""Jojo Rabbit"" takes a well-known (and unfortunately still very current) message and breathes fresh air into it. For me Waititi's humor and slapstick were neither disrespectful nor inappropriate, but clever and above all funny! Not every joke knocked me out of the chair, I was rather grinning more because the film came across so charmingly. And ""charming"" is such an appropriate word for me when it comes to this film!<br/><br/>Because even despite the jokes, despite the satirical view of a terrifying time, in my eyes ""Jojo Rabbit"" creates a powerful statement about the war, fascism and its effects. There are moments that hit you completely unexpected, but that's exactly why they are so strong for me. A main reason why I liked the film so much.<br/><br/>Let¬¥s take a look at the cast: The little, talented Roman Griffin Davis makes his film debut and is just wonderful. Naive, energetic, but also soulful and adorable stubborn. He is the heart of the film and in my eyes deserves a lot of recognition. I didn't find his boyfriend Yorki (Archie Yates) quite as strong, even if he had funny moments. Scarlett Johansson is a charm and plays so lovingly and yet cheekily that it¬¥s a pleasure to watch her. Sam Rockwell scores with a surprisingly multifaceted and funny figure, Stephen Merchant is great, like Alfie Allen and Taika Waititi himself (effectively and wittily) takes on the role of the imaginary leader. Rebel Wilson is also in the film, but she couldn't quite convince me. Luckily, her role is quite small.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot, very colorful and powerful. Cameraman Mihai Malaimare Jr. supports the energy of the film with an equally energetic camera work. The soundtrack is great too. Michael Giacchino delivers a solid score and the song selection (large pop songs with German lyrics) is the final icing on the cake!<br/><br/>Conclusion: ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a wonderful, over-the-top, but still ingenious film. It won't appeal to everyone, but it doesn't have to. Taika Waititi provides a funny, touching and, above all, charming view of a difficult topic. Something that many try, but rarely succeed in doing ..."

"Sonique15","9","1","2","2 February 2020"," Get back, Jojo
","The idea of a funny, yet touching, take on WWII and Nazism is not entirely original, of course. It's easy to think of Chaplin's The Great Dictator, but also, more recently, of Benigni's La vita √® bella (Life is beautiful).
Jojo Rabbit is more irreverent and less poetic than the two mentioned films, but it has got a unique point of view and I enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>The story is very well written, coherent and consistent in every aspect. It doesn't last three hours and it has got just one, clear ending. Thank you Mr. Waititi!<br/><br/>Each character is depicted with lots of humor, and sometimes silliness, but none of the main ones is ever too ridiculous as to lose its humanity or depth. No scene is too dramatic, but some are quite moving.<br/><br/>I liked all the actors, I loved the ending and I adored the music. The scenes at the beginning comparing Beatlemania with ""Nazimania"", with the German version of I want to hold your hand playing loud, are just brilliant.<br/><br/>A film like this is just what we all need at this strange time of history we are living right now."
"joshtill-98100","9","1","2","2 February 2020"," A Masterpiece of a Mixed Genre; Jojo Rabbit cannot be missed
","Thus begins the catching up on the Oscar bait films. I attended a Saturday night screening of Jojo Rabbit and I left having just gone through an emotional roller coaster that was not intended. From previous reviews, this movie just appeared to be a satire comedy, poking fun at the events of the second world war. However, I tell you, this movie is so much more than that. Sure the film ensures a few laughs and giggles, but this film really has heart and that's why I believe critics panned this movie, because the film does not know what genre or age group it is focused at.<br/><br/>The film opens to Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), a German boy obsessed with Nazi Germany, pep-talking himself in the mirror of his bedroom as he prepares to be sent off to Hitler Youth Training Camp. He encounters Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), showcased as Jojo's imaginary friend and mentor. At the camp, Jojo is introduced to Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) and Fr√§ulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), as they teach him and his male peers to do simple tasks, such as murder and false propaganda of anti-semitism. Jojo is penalized for being frightened to murder a little bunny and runs off into the woods. He has a pep-talk with hitler and runs back, interrupting Klenzendorf's grenade launching class. Jojo accidentally throws a grenade at a tree, which bounces right back to his side. Jojo suffers major injuries including a large scar down his face and a limp. Klenzendorf sends Jojo home to be under house arrest for a few months.<br/><br/>After making a bit of recovery, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), Jojo's mother, drops Jojo off at Klenzendorf's office, who has been demoted to office camp because of Jojo's accident. Rahm orders Jojo to do rather simple tasks such as hang up nazi propaganda across the town. As Rosie takes him home, they notice a public hanging in the town square. The next day, home alone, Jojo hears creaks in his house, which he narrows down to his elder sisters bedroom. He discovers that his mother had been hiding a young jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie). Jojo threatens to call the gestapo, but Elsa reassures him, stating that if he were to note the authorities, then he and his mother would suffer for hiding her.<br/><br/>That night, Jojo looks in disgust at his mother, acknowledging the fact that she has put the whole family in grave danger by having a jew in the house. Rosie notices this and offends Jojo, using ashes from the fireplace to create a makeshift beard, poking fun at Jojo's sexist father and states that she is in charge. Later, Rosie brings her dinner plate to Elsa, unaware that her and Jojo have already met. Daily, Jojo interrogates Elsa while Rosie is at work. Elsa gives Jojo false information about jews appearances and history. She claims she is engaged to a boy named Nathan. Jojo creates a makeshift letter in order to assure that she is frightful of him. After realizing what he has done, Jojo creates another letter, stating that everything in the first letter was false. One day, while doing work for Rahm, Jojo encounters his old mate Yorkie, whom is now a Nazi soldier. He bluntly tells Yorkie that he is hiding a jew, but Yorkie is too busy to focus. Jojo also encounters his mother leaving a ""free Germany"" slip of paper in town.<br/><br/>A few days later, Jojo notices that Elsa is quite dirty and offers her his house's amenities, such as a bath and his mothers robe. The joy for Elsa is short-lived as the gestapo arrives at Jojo's door to investigate his house. Elsa runs upstairs but cannot find a way to re-enter the hiding place unheard by the gestapo. As they investigate, Klenzendorf arrives too. As the leading Gestapo officer (Stephen Merchant) notices that Jojo's safety pocketknife is missing from his uniform, Elsa appears holding the knife. Elsa tells the gestapo that he is Jojo's older sister Inge. Klenzendorf interrogates Elsa and sets her free. Once the policemen and Klenzendorf leave, Elsa breaks down, noticing that she gave the wrong birth date, but Klenzendorf let her go. As he is picking up scrap pieces of metal in the town square, Jojo sees Rosie's dead body having been hanged for her crimes.<br/><br/>Jojo arrives back home, devastated and attempts to murder Elsa, but cannot find the strength to do it due to his affection for her. Elsa showcases mutual affection and comforts him, showing him the glimmer of hope she still has that the war will soon be over. A few days later, Jojo is wandering about town where he encounters Yorkie once more, who states that Hitler has committed suicide due to the allies closing in on Germany. Jojo refused to acknowledge this fact, until he sees explosions coming from fighter jets. The two boys run to hide, where they run in to Rahm, falsely promoting the little boy soldiers and tells them to shoot anyone that doesn't look German. She puts a makeshift coat on Jojo, and enters the battlefield with a bazooka, before she and the rest of the soldiers, minus Yorkie, perish from an explosion.<br/><br/>The soviets find Jojo and pin him up against a wall, where he re-encounters Klenzendorf. Klenzendorf tells Jojo that his mother was good-hearted and he wanted to return the favour by saving Elsa. Klenzendorf does one final good deed and throws Jojo's coat off and calls him a jew. Jojo is put back onto the street as Klenzendorf is shot several times for his anti-Semitic behaviour. Jojo cannot seem to find the courage to tell Elsa that war is over, so she tells her that Germany won. Acknowledging her saddened outcome, Jojo recites another fake letter written from him in the perspective of Nathan. Elsa reveals that Nathan died a year prior from tuberculosis. Jojo finally confesses his love for Elsa, but Elsa states she only sees him as a younger brother. Hitler arrives one more time to confront Jojo, but Jojo throws him out of a window. Jojo tells Elsa the truth about the war outcome as the two head outside, as they dance together.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is a very sweet movie at its core. The only thing keeping this movie from a perfect score is the beginning chunk of the film. It feels quite elongated and unneeded as well as I believe there could have been more character development with Klenzendorf and Rahm, for I was basically calling them Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson during the films duration. I do think that Roman Griffin Davis has a bright career ahead, but the one who truly stood out to me in this film was Thomasin McKenzie. Although she is supposed to play a scared Jewish girl hiding in a German household, McKenzie showcases this strength and other side to this character that was quite cool.<br/><br/>Overall, Jojo Rabbit gets a 9/10."

","Here's my review of JoJo Rabbit . So JoJo Rabbit is directed by Taika Waititi , the  genius with an Ace Ventura persona who gave us Thor frickin Ragnarok ! which was one of my favorite movies of 2017 and that made me look back at his old films and the one thing common among them is that they're really funny but with a lot of human connection . Taika's humour is a unique brand that only he can land and that's what makes this movie work so well. The movie stars this pre drug use McCauley Culkin lookalike kid who's just brilliant in this movie ! The story is set in Germany amidst world war 2 where JoJo , a wannabe boy scout and Hitler fanatic comes across a Jew girl in hiding and becomes skeptical over his priorities . Taika Waititi himself , like in all his movies plays an extended cameo of JoJo's imaginary version of Adlof Hitler and he was bloody brilliant as well , Scarlett Johannson plays JoJo's Mom and she's on a roll with this and last year's ' Marriage story ' some damn good acting right there. Other supporting characters which includes Sam Rockwell as Captain k was hilarious ! All other characters were written brilliantly and had the right screen space. The movie takes you in for a satire on war and turns into something much more amazing as it progresses.

"bob-the-movie-man","8","1","2","16 January 2020"," Don't be stupid, be a smarty.
","Taika Waititi's much discussed movie is an odd beast. Set in a small German town towards the end of the war, Jojo (Roman Griffith Davis), is a young boy indoctrinated with Nazi fervour as a member of the Hitler youth. Together with his rotund and bespectacled friend Yorki (Archie Yates), they are not likely to spread fear into the approaching Allied forces: they are a pair that would be likely to get picked last for 'sides' in a school football match.<br/><br/>Perhaps to bolster his flagging self-esteem, Jojo has an imaginary friend - - Adolf Hitler (played by director Taika Waititi). Hitler provides him with sage - and sometimes foolish - advice. His mother (Scarlett Johansson), as well as obviously being hot and thus obtaining lustful looks from returning troops, is also kindly. She makes up for the absence of Jojo's father, due to the war, with the help of some play-acting and a sooty beard.<br/><br/>But, when alone in the house, Jojo hears noises from upstairs, his world - and his whole belief system - begins to unravel.<br/><br/>Comedies have tip-toed around the sensibilities of World War II in the past, most famously with Mel Brook's ""The Producers"". I don't think anyone's previously been brave enough to introduce the holocaust into the comedy mix. And - to a degree... we are NOT talking excessive bad taste here - the movie goes there. There's an underlying sharpness to some of the dialogue that - despite not being Jewish myself - nevertheless put my sensibilities on edge: the pit in hell 'set aside for Jews', for example, is filled with not only piranhas... but also bacon.<br/><br/>As a satire lampooning Antisemitism, much of the comedy is slapstick and the anti-Jewish sentiments expressed are deliberately ludicrous. And it's one of my issues I guess with the film. There are some good lines (Rebel Wilson's fanatical Nazi screaming ""Let's burn some books"" at the students) but some of the slapstick farce just didn't work for me. Sam Rockwell is great as a one-eyed ex-war hero looking for new challenges and exuberant costumes! But a lame gag from him about German Shepherds made me go ""What? Really?"". And this lessens the impact for me of the satire.<br/><br/>The second half of the film for me was far better, taking a much darker and edgier tone. There's a sudden turn in the film - brilliantly executed - that is truly shocking. This scene is somewhat reminiscent of one in that other great Holocaust comedy, ""Schindler's List"". It's understated, yet devastating. (Now, before seeing the film I'd heard from other reviews that the film ""turned darker"" and - based on the trailer - I'd kind of set in my mind what that would be. But I was wrong! So take this comment not as a spoiler, but as an anti-spoiler!).<br/><br/>As the war unravels for Germany, a late re-appearance by the imaginary Hitler is also memorable.<br/><br/>As the young star, Welsh kid Roman Griffith Davis - with no previous acting experience - turns in a star performance. Though to say that the performance ranks alongside the top 5 male performances of 2019 is, I think, overstepping the mark. Scarlett Johansson got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role. And I think this is deserved.<br/><br/>Elsewhere in the cast, few seemed to have recognized Thomasin McKenzie's role playing Elsa. The 19 year-old New Zealander really delivered for me. A strong female character, she's vulnerable yet with a will of iron under the surface. She made me really care about the outcome of the story.<br/><br/>Less positive for me is Rebel Wilson. Here she is marginally less annoying than I normally find her in that she's playing a deliberately annoying and unhinged character. But the role seemed largely redundant to me: it didn't add anything to the overall story (unlike Rockwell's - surprising - character arc).<br/><br/>If there was an Oscar for originality - and that WOULD be a good new award category - then this film would be a contender. It's certainly novel: amusing in places; disturbing in others. If you like your comedies on the edge and bit whacky - like ""Death of Stalin"" - then you will probably enjoy this. I'm not sure it's the best film of the year - and there are probably others I would swap into that Oscars nomination list - but it's still a well-made movie and a recommended watch.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web.

","This film was funny (if a bit silly at times), heartwarming and heartbreaking. I laughed and I cried. I going to steer clear of any major spoilers so any I do give will only be ones that you would have already known if you've seen the trailer<br/><br/>
My friend is a huge fan of the director and she was desperate to see this film, so we went and saw it as a last thing to do before she was going away for a while. Anyway. I went with middle expectations. I was presently surprised. I had listened to the radio four Saturday review of it and so was expecting the film to be silly. I was actually surprised. I laughed out loud on a number of occasions. And cried as well.<br/><br/>The humour was well done. Not to slapstick but not too subtle. They did it well. You didn't feel guilty for laughing at the nazi-ism or at the accident.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson:
She was advised as the main big name in the film. In reality she wasn't in it much to begin with. She was a bit in the middle (good crotch kick Rosie!!) and none at the end.

It's very smart about what it achieves, but I would have liked to see more humour and outlandishness as it is a bit slow in parts.

","This film could not have premiered one moment before now, on the 1st of January 2020 when it actually did in the United Kingdom, anyway thanks to its perplexing subject jagged with almost blasphemous jokes, candid characters and vital lessons.
Maori/Jewish director, Taika Waititi continues to amaze us now with at least about 35% (that being Disney) of the industry backing him. Not to take any credit away from him or being jealous at all (well...maybe the latter)
Titular character Jojo Betzler (newcomer Roman Griffin Davis), aged very young when he joins the Hitlerjugend which seems like a totally fantastic and undoubtedly the most patriotic experience according to any brainwashed ten-year old living in nazi Germany at the time of WWII. Not far off into the movie we are to realize, as well as Jojo's comrades are that he is not the most suitable person to cue in line and become the Fuhrer's best bodyguard thanks to an unfortunate incident involving an innocent little rabbit (hence the name Rabbit) followed by an even more unfortunate incident with a hand grenade. Luckily, Jojo has the best medical experts at hand and his biggest idol available for him drawn straight out of his imagination - loosely based on reality, of course - none other but the almighty Adolf himself (played comedically by Waititi himself) who is never shy to put our little friend's thoughts back on track with whatever means necessary while the actor/director/writer also does not refrain from ridiculing every possible aspect of the late leader of the Aryan nation. When sticking to more realistic people Jojo is being tutored by his wonderful mother (Scarlett Johansson single-handedly) about love and all good things and by war-crazed amicable veteran Cpt. Klenzendorf (always amusing Sam Rockwell) about...well, not so sure how to address that. Things start to ravel when he discovers a teenage Jewish girl, named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) is hiding behind the walls of their very house and a curious relationship starts to form between the kids. As Jojo learns more about the real world and starts suffering from butterflies in his tummy his faith in the greatest nation and its lunatic leader begins to fade away.
You may think it feels a bit like Roberto Benigni's emotional rollercoaster, 'La Vita e Bella' and you are not the only one but even if it does so we certainly can not blame anyone for having an influence on them especially when the end-product is so perfectly orchestrated with freshened up humour and parodic characters in tragic moments seasoned with trivial but gripping facts from the darkest of hours.
Professionally crafted elements decorate the entire 108 minutes of the film. We shall remain stunned by the glorious - well from the eyelevel of a child, anyway - shots ever so vibrant in colours (less so towards the end signifying the troubling times) delivered by Romanian cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr and by tunes like the good old 'Komm, gib mir deine Hand' by ... wait, what? The Beatles?! Yes, they did that, too. Them buggers. The German version of 'I wanna hold your hand' by England's greatest band respectively, complements the archive footages of chaos fittingly along with David Bowie's 'Helden' as well as many others are doing their part and lifting the spirit with much necessity as we try not to choke on tears crashing down our cheeks witnessing all the innocent and the not so innocent bloodshed the craziness claimed during humanities most desperate times. A little reminder from Waititi for the start of the new decade to be a bit nicer to our fellow comrades, withstand oncoming waves together and especially not to fall behind  manifestos so we could perhaps evade the recurring arms of history.<br/><br/>Verdict:8/10
Team Marvel assembled their best and most capable with added charm from the newly appointed 11 year-old superhero to pull the Rabbit out of the hat just in time for this year's award gala. Well, they did it f*ing brilliant"
"adityarocks-38866","8","1","2","2 January 2020"," Seen a good comady /drama based on world war time period after a long time.
","When it comes to world war there are a lot good movies out there. But very few of there a comady. And even out of these there are very few one which we could say that it's a good comady movie based on world war and this is one of them.
The thing which makes this movie different from rest of world war movies were that most of the world war movies either shows people fighting in the war for their country or misery of people leaving in that time period( in short basically the serious stuff). Though in this movie also those serious stuffs are being showing but the way in which the story moves on makes them funny and some times emotional also.
The second thing which i liked about thing one was that there are very few movies depicting the world war through the eye of a child and that also of a Nazi kid makes it more special.
The funny interaction of the Jojo and the Hitler also adds a charm in the movie. Overall this movie is good and is not going to make you feel bored even not a single time. This movie is just flawless."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","1","2","1 January 2020"," Four balls out of five.
","Waititi's secret weapon is, as it always has been, his uncanny ability to provoke genuine emotion even in the broadest of comedies. This is what makes 'Jojo Rabbit (2019)', which is brazenly bizarre on paper, work as well as it does. The characters are crafted to be much more than the humourous archetypes they initially threaten to be; they're actually rather nuanced and their relationships all feel palpable. They have arcs which are predictable yet satisfying, which are evocative of the entire affair. The flick may be a comedy, but it makes a point of having its tragedies hit home incredibly hard. There are more than a few emotionally resonant moments, each strong enough to provoke tears and bolster the underlying truth of the story's situation. The picture wisely depicts its central situation as properly bleak, showing exactly what its more outlandish elements actually cost. Its easy to poke fun at the Nazis, but it's necessary to make sure their deplorable acts never get the same treatment. Luckily, this handles the dilemma rather well. It walks the line but it's never distasteful, with its 'anti-hate' messages always feeling evident. The movie is broadly funny, with several (somewhat uncomfortable) laughs and a generally heightened world. It sometimes struggles to balance its satiric humour with its genuine heart, though. Basically, it's a bit odd, tonally. Plus, it isn't all that complex; it's message is (hopefully) obvious. Sadly, it's easy to imagine unknowing children 'heil'-ing Hitler in the street because they saw it here, the satire having gone over their ignorant little heads, but I suppose Waititi's responsibility only goes so far. I mean, the affair is clearly positioned against Nazism. It's entertaining, affecting, funny, heartbreaking and, generally, very well-made. It walks the line, and wobbles a bit while doing it, but it never falls off and it reaches a satisfying conclusion. 8/10"

"s3276169","8","1","2","30 December 2019"," Clever comedic satire......
","There's no denying Jojo Rabbit is a clever piece of cinema. It takes the hysteria surrounding Nazism in Germany in WWII and subverts it, by focusing its idiocy through a lens of everyday, ""normalcy"".<br/><br/>Hatred of Jews with absurd caricatures and rumours. Beatles like hysteria over the Fuhrer, who is idolised by the main character to the point of becoming an imaginary friend. The bizarre rituals and militarised games played by Hitler Youth are all brought into focus. Its nutty stuff and skewed from this angle, often quite funny, as insightful satire should be.<br/><br/>That's not to say this is entirely new. Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator did it first and in a general sense, did it better. Indeed, this film does have its shortcomings. Chief of which, is its retrospective moral outrage, over the treatment of the Jews. As my mother, who lived through WWII noted years ago, ""everyone was sorry after the fact but not sorry enough at the time, to do anything meaningful about it"".<br/><br/>Suffice to say, it would have been better, I feel, to look more into the character of the young Jewish girl hiding in the families home, presenting her as a human being first and foremost. This would have said more, than moral angst ever could.<br/><br/>A little disappointed too to see yet more anti Russian sentiment. The Russians did not typically execute prisoners, only those found guilty of war crimes. Many did die in captivity but that happened in US and Soviet custody.<br/><br/>That said, what this film does demonstrate in a innocently funny but also very sad way, is how Nazism effected children. Something that is often overlooked, when visiting this period of history.<br/><br/>Suffice to say there's a lot to like here. This films funny, sad, likeable, down to earth, and a bit zany. For me a must watch.<br/><br/>8/10."

","In an unnamed German city, Johannes Beltzer aka Jojo Rabbit (played by Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year-old boy enlisted in the Hitler Youth organization during the later years of World War II. Despite his naive dedication to Nazism, his clumsiness leaves him unsuitable for the harder aspects of junior war duty.<br/><br/>While the spoken language in the film is English, notes, posters, and pamphlets are in German. This mix is questionable but less questionable than the film's mix of satirical humour with genuine drama.<br/><br/>Jojo has an imaginary adult Nazi friend named Adolf (a light caricature of Hitler) played by the film's writer/director, Taika Waititi. Much of the humour (attempted or otherwise) seems to be at Jojo's expense in a sometimes sadistic way. Interestingly, the dark humour / satire aspects of the film's first half seem unnecessary as well as silly. Its dramatic side (more prominent in the second half) is quite touching and could have stood alone without earlier attempts at lightness.<br/><br/>All scenes involving Jojo's mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) raise the film to a higher level. This is not just due to the performance but also the very different character: someone who tries her best to shed light on her and Jojo's situation while her country has sunk to the lowest depths.<br/><br/>There are also three exceptional scenes. One involves an unusual revelation of a death that is shocking and heartbreaking. Another involves an unexpected visit by the Gestapo to inspect Jojo's home. A surprising twist occurs in that scene - one that creates much fear and tension. And finally, the scene that indicates the end of the war is very powerful. That scene includes humour that is actually quite fitting via Jojo's friend Yorki, (Archie Yates), another Hitler Youth misfit who spews out absurd Nazi lies including outrageous assumptions about British soldiers.<br/><br/>Portraying a teenaged Jewish girl who has experienced far more than any young person should have, Thomasin McKenzie shows great talent. In silence, her face shows many pent-up, conflicting emotions. Hopefully, she will be in many more movies in the years ahead."

","It's a very heart warming story of a young boy who is struggling with his identity in Nazi Germany. The film itself has a good depth of story. If you're coming into this expecting more comedy than drama, you may be disappointed. I personally feel the acting within the film leaves you admiring the cast, as they portray their characters well enough. This story has a heavy emphasis on love and identity. Almost every character in JoJo Rabbit has some element of trying to understand themselves in their day-to-day life, which adds an element of realism to the film. I feel there are good lessons in the film that warrant watching it. The movie is also a tear-jerker. I recommend recognizing that before going in. If you're watching this movie for a lot of laughs, you may find yourself underwhelmed though there is some comedic parts to it, but the underlying moral principles and self-actualization of each character is profoundly demonstrated. Definitely a movie for those who love a good story with character depth."
"cappiethadog","2","9","52","18 November 2019"," The political and the personal
","A real Nazi would step on the blue butterfly. At Hitler Youth camp, older boys teach the younger ones to be dispassionate towards killing. By the time these youngsters are done with this program of systemic brainwashing, the newly-minted soldier will have no harder time shooting a man in the head than twisting a rabbit's neck. A ten-year-old boy, that's all Jojo(Roman Griffin Davis) is, caught up in the wrong place and time on this spinning green planet, but Berlin circa 1945 happen to be his fate, making him ten in dog years. His relative innocence is barbed, however, since the boy, despite lacking the killer instinct to fatally injure small forest creatures, the little Nazi desperately wants to be a credit to the German race. He wants to be like everybody else. Because of this guilt, Adolph Hitler(Taika Waititi) repeatedly appears as his imaginary friend, rooting Jojo on to be evil. It's not a matter of Jojo objecting to party ideology; he believes that an Aryan has absolute power over the animal kingdom. His inherent goodness embarrasses him; he places the rabbit on the ground and shoos him. The Fuhrer of Jojo's own making has filmic DNA traceable to the camp counselor Bill Murray plays in Ivan Reitman's ""Meatballs"". Waititi, in fact, seems to be channeling Tripper in the next scene, when Jojo returns to his group with the same anarchic spirit, running encouragingly alongside the Rudy-like(Chris Makepeace) kid, as if throwing a live grenade was an event in the Olympiad. Jojo's shame derives, not from some moral failure of the fatherland, but rather, what he sees as his own personal failure in regard to treating the murder of lesser lives, both human and animal, as a good soldier's mandate without tears. The kid is a zealot; he has Nazimania. Jojo lives with the enemy; Rosie(Scarlett Johannsen), his own mother, the real hero of ""Jojo Rabbit"". Unbeknownst to Jojo, the mother is anti-fascist and an unequivocal Jewish sympathizer. It's a man's world, even if the boy is not yet a man. Despite being older than him, Jojo is master of the house. Rosie knows, with some certainty, that her ten-year-old son would hand Elsa(Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl she hides behind a hollowed-out wall, over to the gestapo for not being blonde with blue eyes. Jojo, unapologetically, is an anti-Semite; a jarring political position, to be sure, for a comedy. The boy plays mind games with his mother, greedily eating Rosie's two bread slices that she had planned on saving for Elsa. Jojo knows her mother's secret. It's a discreet interrogation with the goal of entrapping his mother for her role in harboring a known enemy; a treasonous act punishable by death. Because of Jojo's tender age, labeling him as the hero seems only natural, but ""Jojo Rabbit"" is not that simple. Rosie loves her son, but he is a stranger in her own house. Ultimately, Jojo pays the price for buying into party-line propaganda about Germans being human civilization's master race. The butterfly leads Jojo to a pair of dangling legs. The shoes belong to his mother. ""Jojo Rabbit"", directed by Taika Waititi, doesn't seem aware, just like its complicated protagonist, how Rosie ended up in a public square, swinging at the gallows. Does the filmmaker actually believe that Jojo deserves recognition as being one of the heroes, the David Bowie song's namesake that accompanies the scene in which Elsa realizes the American soldiers have liberated her?<br/><br/>This boy is not a hero.<br/><br/>Let's rewind.<br/><br/>Dagger in hand, Jojo finally works up the nerve to kill, or rather, go through the motions, because cold-blooded murder is not really in his DNA, which continues to be a constant source of humiliation. For the fuhrer, the schutzstaffel, and most of all, his mother, he stabs Elsa near the shoulder. The Jewish girl stops the knife's forward momentum, but not before it breaks skin, enough to draw blood and leave a miniscule splotch on her blouse. Elsa probably knows why German authorities had stopped by unannounced to sweep the house for contraband humans, yet the illegal girl, despite being maimed, willingly plays the scapegoat, as an act of magnanimity. Impersonating Jojo's deceased sister. Elsa got the birthdate wrong on Inge's identification papers when Captain Klezendorf(Sam Rockwell) quizzes her. If not for the captain's fondness for this ten-year-old loyalist, Elsa would have been outed immediately, placed under arrest, and processed for deportation, on the next train to Auschwitz. Rosie's fate is sealed, the audience realizes, in retrospect, when Klezendorf asks Jojo if his mother ""spends much time at home"". This pint-sized Nazi, the audience needs to remember, since ""Jojo Rabbit"" can, at times, be confused for Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"", that the kid is a real patriot who bought hook, line, and sinker, every fiction about the inferiority of the Jewish race as objective fact. Chillingly, Rosie never broaches the subject of his party's amorality with Jojo because she knows that mentors such as Captain Klezendorf had turned her son into an automaton, a robot, so to speak. Case and point, the boy catches his mother distributing leaflets which read: ""Free Germany!"" under the guise of a robot, while out collecting scrap metal for the war effort. Replace the robot costume with a soldier's uniform, and suddenly, it's easier to gauge the ideological war at home as a trenchant one. Does Jojo know about ethnic cleansing? Most likely. The boy doesn't interject as Elsa, who wrongly equates her loss with his, explains that she, too, has been orphaned. Jojo, plain and simple, talks too much. Too many times to too many people, Jojo asks about the proper course of action should he spot a dislocated Jew; a hypothetical so thinly-veiled, even Yorki(Archie Yates), a conscripted soldier his own age, understands intuitively that somebody of non-Aryan descent lives under his roof. Did Yorki, a young ideologue like his best friend, put together: ""I have a girlfriend now,"" with ""I captured a Jew,"" and report this to Captain Klezendorf, corroborating what he already knew from Jojo's own unwitting testimony. There is, after all, no love lost between the captain and Rosie, who knees him in the crotch and slaps him across the cheek with a black glove, right in front of his bureaucratic subordinates, after she learns that Jojo nearly blew himself up with a grenade under Klezendorf's command. Played as comedy, the audience laughs, but the debased captain, it should be noted, would have been a soldier in the Waffen-SS if not for his handicap; a defective left eye. More likely than not, Klezendorf reported Jojo's mother to the gestapo, as revenge for his public humiliation, and lest we forget, because he's a Nazi.<br/><br/>The titular character in Cate Shortland's ""Lore"", a 2012 historical drama about the outset of postwar Germany, just like Jojo, has to unlearn everything she was taught as a Hitler Youth. Hannalore Dressler(Saskia Rosendahl), the oldest daughter of a high-ranking Nazi officer, during her long trek, accompanied by four younger siblings to Omi's house, accepts, begrudgingly, the help of Thomas(Kai Malima), a concentration camp survivor, and sees for herself, slowly over their shared experiences as provisional allies, that Jewish people don't smell like ""brussel sprouts"" and have horns concealed under their hair. Omi tells her: ""You must never feel ashamed of them. Your parents did nothing wrong."" Ironically, these are the words that Jojo has to wrestle with; he was indeed ashamed of Rosie for being unpatriotic, and his father, too; a war deserter. Over time, the boy will realize that he, albeit unintentionally, informed on his own mother. Rosie died because she was living with a party loyalist. The boy could not separate the political from the personal. Jojo's shame, the longer he gets to know Elsa, will grow exponentially, and finally, one day, he'll realize with perfect lucidity that his mother was the real patriot, and did nothing wrong. His mom; his beautiful mom, who tried to teach him that real Germans sing and dance, fall in and out of love; not kill, was right.<br/><br/>For the time being, Jojo isn't quite there yet. ""Jojo Rabbit"" doesn't seem to understand that Elsa suffers from Stockholm Syndrome. Jojo used this Jewish girl as research for a book-in-progress about the origins of her people. Elsa is leaving Berlin with the boy who stabbed her.<br/><br/>""Lore"" ends with the holocaust, a metaphoric one. Hannalore's mother, the wife of a war criminal, kept a porcelain menagerie on her dresser as a young girl. A doe at repose, Mutti's favorite that the oldest daughter carried with her from home; she saves for last, crushing this memento of her family's Nazi-affiliated past with the heel of a ""store-bought"" shoe. She scatters the porcelain animal body parts on her mother's dresser, mirroring the black and white photos of the concentration camps.<br/><br/>As a young girl, an officer's daughter, Hannalore would have snapped that rabbit's neck without any hesitation. She would have been one of the girls snickering at Jojo's reluctance to kill the rabbit<br/><br/>Jojo was a mama's boy.<br/><br/>This horrified him.<br/><br/>After the song is over, and the dancing stops, that's when the real horror begins.<br/><br/>Lore had bad parents, whereas Jojo's mother was Jojo Lioness, but the cub couldn't see the urban sprawl of the German forest for the trees."

","Jojo Rabbit is a film directed, written by, and starring Taika Waititi as an imaginary version of Hitler. It's an incredibly accessible indie comedy and I'd recommend it to pretty much everyone, Especially if you like movies like Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. The story has a lot of charm and kind of pokes fun at the blind fanaticism that the Nazis had for their country with many of the people in the film including our protagonist being excited to go to war. The film does an impeccable job of comparing this fanaticism to the true horrors of war with many characters being shown having severe injuries or even dying. Aside from the satirical aspect, the story is one of two people from different worlds getting to know one another, which is a timeless concept that can be applied to many different settings.The many technical aspects are done well. The editing is good, the cinematography is good, the music ranges from generic to German versions of iconic songs, the color grading is similar to that of many more serious WWII movies and that's all I really want to say without spoiling
I think one issue that I am a bit split on is the tone of the film. For the most part it stays pretty lighthearted but then all of a sudden it gets really dark quickly. However it still works well and is tonally sound but the sudden tonal whiplash is a bit jarring. It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie too heavily though. Plot wise the movie was solid. It didn't really drag in too many places and it had a solid pace. All of the actors do an incredible job as well and help to bring the story to life."

I laughed at one of the darker jokes and realized no-one else was laughing, but then again, that's what you should expect. Not all of it was dark humor as they added some lighthearted jokes, which is one of the reasons why I appreciate this film.<br/><br/>What really makes this film stand out are the characters such as, Jojo, Elsa, the mother, and Yorki. What I wasn't expecting was getting attached to the characters and actually caring for them. These were portrayed as darker times and there were a lot of people who deserved so much better. The film tries to break norms from the past by having a ""Nazi"" boy befriending a Jewish girl. It continues to ridicule the beliefs that Nazis had about Jews, and that's part of its humor.<br/><br/>If you would get offended by what the film seems to portray at first sight, then you should avoid this. To the others, this is a recommended watch."
"paul-allaer","8","2","7","10 November 2019"," Using absurd and black humor to expose Hitler and Nazi Germany
","""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019 release; 108 min.) brings the story of Jojo. As the movie opens, 10 yr. old Jojo is pledging allegiance to his imaginary friend Adolf Hitler, while we also get clips of Hitler-mania in Germany, as the Beatles' Komm Gib Mir Deiner Hand plays along. Jojo joins the Hitler Jugend traning camp in what we learn are the waning months of the Third Reich. Returning from camp, Jojo is startled to learn that a Jewish girl, Elsa, is hiding in the attic, helped by Jojo's mom. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest work from New Zealander Taika Waititi, who recently directed ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and before that the excellent ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"". Here Waititi not only directs, but also wrote the scrip, produces, AND stars as the wacky Adolf Hitler (as imagined in the mind of a 10 yr. old boy). There is lots of humor, mostly of the absurd if not black kind, but along the way plenty of points are made as well about intolerance and hate and the absurdity of war. British newcomer Roman Griffin Davis is nothing short of sensational as the young boy. His mom is played by Scarlett Johansson. Australian actress Thomasin McKenzie, outstanding in ""Leave No Trace"" is excellent as the Jewish teenager Else. Surely we have not seen the last of her (or of Davis). There are excellent song placements in the movie, including Love's ""Everybody's Gotta Live"", Roy Orbinson's ""Mama"" and David Bowie's ""Helden"", which plays in the very last scene of the movie and then over the end titles.<br/><br/>""Jojo Rabbit"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September to positive buss. After being released in NY and LA, the movie gradually rolled out to other cities and it made its way to Cincinnati last weekend. I finally got around to seeing it this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very well, a bit to my surprise as this is NOT a very ""mainstream""-like movie. If you are in the mood to check out a new perspective on Hitler and Nazi Germany with a heavy dose of absurd and black humor, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."

","""Jojo Rabbit"" Review
(9/10)<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit aims to tackle the difficult subject matter blind devotion and a coming-of-age film with grace and comedic flair that just works, and I absolutely love Hitler Waititi.
The coming-of-age story paired with the imaginary friend trope is as old as it comes but there are always different ways to approach it. In this case, director Taika Waititi decided the best way to address this is to go all the way to 11 and embrace it whole hog. Jojo's Adolf is the kind of happy and supportive imaginary friend we see all the time, the Hobbs to Jojo's Calvin, but the juxtaposition of it being Hitler is part of the shock value. It also gives us insight into what kind of little boy Jojo is.
The point, ultimately, comes down to the fact that there isn't anything that remarkable about Jojo. He's exactly the right age and temperament to buy completely into the propaganda that Nazism was putting out at this point in the war. He's just a normal little kid except for the fact that he is convinced that all Jews are evil monsters that are trying to kill him. That changes when he meets Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) a young Jewish girl that Jojo's protective mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is trying to keep safe. Being so close to the perceived ""enemy"" is a bit of a wake-up call for Jojo and the reality of the world around him comes like a kick in the teeth.
That aforementioned gut punch is one of the reasons that Jojo Rabbit works as well as it does. By the time the third act rolls around the movie isn't being subtle at all because there isn't any need to be. Jojo has had his wake up call and it's like the whole world around him shifts as his perspective of the world changes. The world has been collectively looking for ways to cope with the horrors of World War II since the moment the war ended and there have been a few people calling Waititi out for this approach. He is far from the first filmmaker to make Hitler look silly but what makes Jojo Rabbit so well is the human element. We aren't just seeing Hitler we're seeing Hitler through the eyes of a young boy who has complete faith in the institution he's involved in.
Jojo Rabbit is one of those movies that is going to drive a lot of people away because of the concept alone. However, it's a wonderfully funny movie that keeps a good pace and never feels boring. The shift toward the end of the second act is a gut punch and it makes the end of the movie all the more powerful for it."
"meetjessicac","9","2","7","9 November 2019"," Hilarious is the new serious
","I don't think being hilarious and serious are contradictory. This movie is actually talking about a serious topic although it tells the story in an easygoing way. I found a mix of real and extremely strong emotions in it, funny and sad. They are well expressed by the characters because they are so real. It is not always the case that people are either good or bad, they are just human beings."
"mvrk","7","2","7","9 November 2019"," What is wrong with you people? More sad than satirical!
","Everyone is saying this is good satire and praises and praises but did we see the same movie? It's funny and satirical for the first half, then when the mom gets killed all jokes and satire don't seem funny anymore. I mean there are good jokes and satire after the mom dies but they fall flat and you don't feel like laughing anymore. The kid for friggin sake was grabbing on to his moms feet when she was hanged and cried and cried. Ho ho ha ha very funny! What is wrong with all of you? It didn't become dark but it became more serious.<br/><br/>Besides, most of the jokes are already in the trailers. Now the movie on itself is unique and good. Nothing like it has been done before, just maybe Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds where he makes Hitler into a doofus. But I just don't like the false advertising this movie is doing. The trailers and tv spots are showing this as a whacky funny laugh out loud comedy. For most part of the film it isn't for the reasons stated above. I also wouldn't call it a dark comedy, because it isn't.<br/><br/>I was hoping that this would be a satire on the Hitler Youth as this movie was promoted, with bungling cute kids who mess things up and don't know right from left.<br/><br/>But one thing I'd like to say: Scarlett Johansson will hands down most probably 100% win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. I say this because it's her best performance since Lost in Translation, and I'm thankful she's out of those awful Marvel movies. The studio will push for supporting actress because it's easier to win even though she is the lead actress."
"heidi-19","10","2","7","2 November 2019"," A Cautionary Tale and Wonderful Film
","My takeaway from this movie (which I saw with my husband on Thursday and our 16 year old son on Friday) is that we have to watch what garbage our kids consume. If they are exposed to poisonous ideologies, they will be conflicted. In Jojo's case, he had a parent(s) with a healthy moral compass, so he had an anchor at home to guide his better angels. His mother repeated the mantra for the insane time of Nazi rule...""They did what they could."" This referred to people persecuted and killed for thwarting the dictatorship.
I completely took this as satire, and it's still a movie that made me cry for joy and sorrow. I will watch anything Taika Waititi creates, and I hope that he makes more thought-provoking cinema like this. Also, I loved the actor performances in this movie. Nothing was precious, just heartbreaking sometimes."

","Enjoyed the acting, especially, kids.
However, at its core, the movie is very shallow and, dare I say, dangerous. The danger is for the younger generation that is going to watch it - they do t really know anything about the war in which 50 million people perished and by watching this they will get a completely wrong idea. Yes, I get it, it's not a historical movie, yet it is what our kids are more likely to see, instead of picking up a book or watching documentaries.
And Jojo Rabbit trivialises nazism, making it look rather like a pathetic joke instead of tragic, violent, brutal and extremely dangerous.
It mocks German language, linking Nazis to the German accent, where there is very little need for it.
And, to top it up, Russian army is presented as villains executing prisoners of war, including little kids, American army is presented in an extremely positive light, twisting the history.
No wonder several public officials claimed its allies and not Red Army liberated Auschwitz. That's exactly the issues I've got with this film and other films that choose to turn the most devastating war into a laughing matter."

","If you can get past the painful anachronistic quality of the language or the fine line between dark humor and tasteless this may be for you. There may have been a reason Jerry Lewis decided not to release ""The Day The Clown Cried"" Simply put...the Holocaust and those who chose to fight on their behalf between lines probably deserves a respectful tone. Instead...the very modern attitude makes it seem like a farce. It's extremely dishonest and when serious things DO happen, you cannot undo them. Towards the end, we get a taste of what that is.
I will give director Waititi credit...this is a swing for the fences, and for the most part works, but I think it'll leave many people wondering why. That said...the other grating thing is knowing the audience knows how reality turns out. Hitler loses. In a bizarro world, it doesn't feel like he does here. In fact, regardless of the child (literally) kicking Hitler to the curb, you sense indoctrination is taken too lightly.
Still...some touching moments with mom Scarlett Johansson though her German accent is horrific...and the efforts to make her this angelic savior of Jewd feels phony. Given Hollywood's penchant for concealing their own monsters.
I'd say middling is very fair."

","Taika Waititi is either a genius or absolutely crazy.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is an absolute blast of a film from start to finish. It's a coming-of-age, over-the-top, war-drama. The film is both light in humor and heavy in topic. It handles darkest sides of war in the most childlike innocence. It's one of the most unconventional satire I've seen.<br/><br/>Certain (obvious) aspects of this film can be divisive in today's culture. Yet, Taika Waititi handles every aspect of the film well. His role as an imaginary Asian-Hitler is a moment of comedic genius. For everything that could of went wrong with this film, themes and comedy are handled in an adult way. None of the jokes felt ""cheap"" by any means. You will find yourself laughing and crying with this film.<br/><br/>The casting choices work in harmony. Roman Griffin Davis's role as Jojo keeps the audience sympathetic to his character. Scarlett Johansson shows real mother-child chemistry with Jojo. Real (innocent) romance can be felt between Jojo and Thomasin McKenzie's character. Taika Waititi is over-the-top and hilarious -- as an imaginary friend should be.<br/><br/>5/5. Absolutely see this film. It's a rollercoaster of emotion that will leave you feeling better at the end."

","JoJo Rabbit is Taika Waititi's (What We Do in the Shadows) latest film. It is a magnificent heartfelt drama/comedy. Set durning World War II, the story follows JoJo (Roman Griffin Davis) a ten year old boy who is being raised by his mother (Scarlett Johansson). His dream is to one day become a member of Hitler's personal guard. To help JoJo to fulfill his dream is his imaginary friend, Adolf ""as in Hitler""(Taika Waititi). JoJo is injured in a terrible (and hilariously acted) accident, durning his first outing with the Hitler Youth.
Upon his recovery he finds his mother has hidden a teenage Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.
Every actor in this film is perfect in their roles. perfection. Young JoJo and his friend Yorkie (Archie Yates)
are both charming and believable. Sam Rockwell is great as always in the role of Captain Klenzendorf, leader of the ""Hitler Youth"" and Rebel Wilson is at her over the top best as Fraulein Rahm.
The story was thought provoking, heartbreaking and hilarious all at the same time. This was Taika at his best. Taking him back to his indie roots. Go check this out, you won't be disappointed."

"sirwillisiv","9","2","8","17 November 2019"," Radically unconventional, but timely nonetheless...
","Jojo Rabbit is the funniest film the year. Bear with me, it's about a Hitler youth befriending a Jewish girl who is hiding in his house. Sounds potentially offensive given the time period and that the protagonist is a self-proclaimed Nazi but the offbeat sweetness and humor really shines through. It portrays Nazis as total buffoons throughout and it's a riot, though it also doesn't ignore the harsh realities of the innocent, naive youth during wartime, which is important but makes the film kind of a tonal jumble at points. It's an anti-hate satire that's both a straight middle finger to racism but cements allegorically that it's not going away and the best we can do is move forward dauntlessly. Taika Waititi is a comedic and symbolic wizard. Again, the offbeat nature of the film may not resonate with most, but I found a lot of amusement, emotion and food for thought out of it. It's a black comedy. It explores dark subject matter in a quirky fashion."
"brianjohnson-20043","9","2","8","15 November 2019"," Funny and makes a statement
","I always like it when filmmakers try something different and it pays off. And this certainly seemed to accomplish that task. It's not entirely a dark comedy. But it's also definitely irreverent and crazy at times. It's also not a drama. But it has poignant heartfelt moments. And it's not a Pixar kids movie either. It's certainly a movie for a mature audience. And it works.<br/><br/>Most movies that try to make a movie in both comedy and drama realms have the two ends compromises the resolve of one other realm to a point where neither works. And the audience feels the tone should have been predominantly one or the other.<br/><br/>So why does this one work with both realms? I think it works because the comedy sequences are a result of naive situations for the lead character and his sidekick. It's the character's obliviousness rather than intentional jokes that makes his dramatic transition still work. Additionally the story is goofy enough at the beginning to get the audience comfortable with the absurd moments and situations infiltrating important moments which arise later. It also was not being afraid to give some dramatic moments for more comedic characters near the beginning.<br/><br/>As for the faults, I thought some of the stuff at the end could have been shown a little clearer and at a quicker pace. Also, one of the character's motivations became a bit unclear at times near the end when it would have been good for the motivations to be a bit clearer at that point.<br/><br/>But I look forward to seeing this movie again. I had a lot of fun at the cinema.<br/><br/>Also, if any big Broadway production company is watching, I think this film could be made into a fabulous musical. This film reminded me a bit of West Side Story, The Producers, Urinetown and Billy Elliot. Apart from The Producers these Broadway shows similarly effectively walk the line between being comedies and dramas."

"vladimirpopovic-25751","10","2","8","12 November 2019"," A comedy gem and a beautiful movie
","I saw Jojo Rabbit on Zagreb Film Festival yesterday and together with the audience I enjoyed the movie so much, in short every scene of this movie was great! Sadly today this is such a rare thing to see. First I was so happy to see Taika's new movie coming out that I didn't care so much what was it about. And what a beautiful surprise it was. Funny, smart, amazing Wes Anderson style shots, superb acting (expecially children) with a strong anti-war and human message and great/original soundtrack! If anyone has any issues with the way this movie is portraying things or characters, please don't. This movie as funny and original, also carries a deep and truthful message that I didn't expect it will take me back to my childhood in the beginning of the 90' when we had a war here in Croatia and I was a 10 year old boy. The war was so much occupying our childsplay, we even had notebooks with cut out newspaper pictures we would glue in, with our leader on the front page (the father of the nation) and war scenes of solders, commandos and war legends, with stupid (demagogic) sentences we would write below, looking up to our heroes of light fighting the enemy from the dark side. Like in the movie that enemy was the devil to us and normally you learn to hate them. And that was just a part of our everyday play and conversations. Innerly I knew and probably wasn't the only one, that emotions and behaviour of hate that the war brings out in people was wrong and disturbing, far from our pure child's naivety and nature. But what do children know how to act or express...we did our roles like others around us. Today these notebooks look sad to me and that is the point of this movie, with wars everybody loses, children especially. Tough the WW2 was decades ago, the strong humane message this film carries is needed for today's world. It emphesizes what we should never forget and that is a fact that we live in propably the best human era in history and it's is very important to look how beautiful our world is. And it's the richness of culture that undoubtedly every nation has is exactly what naturally brings differences and people together oppose to (ilusionist) ideologies that brainwash, blind and block the true human nature and result with the opposite effect of walls of prejudices that divides us. And that is exactly what we should always remember and teach our children so they can one day teach their children and so on.. Another strong point of the movie is that it shows the heros in a subtle way. We all need them, children especially and in the wars where everything gets upside down anyway, the term hero easily becomes controversial depending from which side you see them. Here it starts with the most controversial ""hero"" for a child to look up to, but ends with the true hero in anybody's life and that is the mother. And she's not the only one. All who suffer and refuse to give up, find the strength to go through and all those who help and support them get to be the hero. I love it. Powerful and needed today. Go and see this movie, you will not regret it."

Judging without knowing. Hating without seeing. A beautiful lesson of love and learning and growing and acceptance. I laughed and cried and sat there until the credits ended. And I needed to pee. Absolutely one of the best feel good movies I've ever seen, beautifully acted, brilliantly directed, phenomenal script, I just can't praise it enough.

"thecontentkeeda","9","1","3","1 May 2020"," Every minute of the film satirically mocks fanaticism. And the film couldn't get any better.
","Trying to show it in a serious manner, what this film has shown in a satirical way, would have become too depressing and hard hitting. Waititi's satire manages to create a total mockery of the Nazi regime. A ten-year-old, shown to be a Nazi fanatic is actually interesting. It helps us to understand that prejudice is built at a young age. Through various little nuances, Waititi beautifully shows how fanaticism is born and thrives on propaganda, disinformation and character assassination.
There is one really awesome symbolism in the film. In the beginning Jojo doesn't even know how to tie his shoe lace, and in the end he ties Elsa's shoe lace. Which tries shows how fanatics don't have even basic knowledge and yet they seem as if to have an understanding of the world. When Jojo learns to tie the shoe lace in the end, it shows how he has learned much about the world and he gives up on Nazism."

"arranadam","9","1","3","30 March 2020"," The Banality of Evil
","Taika Waititi navigates across the dark and sensitive coast line of arguably the world's biggest tragedy with a compass of heartfelt and humanitarian grace, gently breezed by the wind of palpable yet fallible characters of which turn a treacherous stormy night into an all but too enjoyable voyage.
The feather-weight touches from Scarlett Johansson outstanding performance as the motherly embodiment of a bitter sweet symphony, as she finds the star in the darkest of nights, sail the film steady - whilst Davis fills the screen with his aptly bouncing personality. McKenzie is, as ever, posthumously mature beyond her years and dangerously talented.
As with all of Waititi's masterpieces, the comedy becomes the catalyst for the heartbreak, which throughout all of his cinema, from Hunt for the Wilderpeople to even Ragnarok, drops like a hammer right through the heart it was previously coaxing. Such tragedy, wrapped in the warm layer of such lovable character-driven comedy, is a honey-pot of emotion that makes the film enchanting regardless of the gravity of its context.
Yet, taken into context, it indeed ascends into something timeless.
Although, in my opinion, it is not Waititi's best work and the film is far from perfect - with it's overall aesthetic residing more as a cheese toastie instead of a filet mignon - Waititi prises open the doorway to our darkest demons, endorsing and encouraging us, like we all should from studying history, to anachronistically learn from the past... and learn that, with just enough cheese, even Hitler can be funny."

I could not believe it was rated PG-13.

Bad because for a multi billion dollar production with a vast history behind it, Skywalker had no soul or passion.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit had everything. Starting with a script that hit every beat, actors that make you believe in the situation, and a story that never lost touch of tis theme that there is hope no matter what the situation.

"vaytseh","10","1","3","10 February 2020"," A boy with grenade
","There's nothing superflous in this movie. From my perspective, the humanism idea has never been depicted so bright and simple. Of course, it's a kind of a cheat code for producers to cast kids, cuz they always act better than adults, it's easier to sympathize them etc. It's a notorious trick, but here it's absolutely justified: there is no other significant way to depict the whole stupidity of agression, fanatism, misconceptions than to show a child with a grenade running towards death with an idol in his brain. The idea is rigidly placed in your brain with just a few tools: childhood, nazism and really dark satire on all those Trumps, Putins, Thunbergs sitting in our brains and dictating us to hate each other for their benefit.<br/><br/>I would also like to highlight Sam Rockwell's captain Klenzendorf (Strainer). He is not just a funny guy, emboding the despair of german military and folk. He is the version of the boy's future: injured, disappointed and dead. Quite symbolic that he is the one who saves the boy and the girl from execution* without trying to save himself. He was sure that Gestapo will reveal his bluff and definitely did not want to be tortured by soviets. Still, he saves the boy who broke his career and a jewish girl. The hell he suffered made him get rid of his inner idols. I hope this movie will affect the audience the same way his war efforts affected him.<br/><br/>* By the way, the Red army seldom killed captured germans (both militia and soldiers), we did that only in exceptional cases like a breakthrough. Moreover, the Red army saved civilians in Berlin underground inundated on Hitler's order. Most captives were sent to Syberia after the Nuremberg trials (communists forced the allies to conduct them, btw). I don't want to justify the crimes of soviets (or any other country which allowed this war) conducted during and before this war, but, really, there's no need to demonize russians, especially in this movie. From the one side this movie postulates ""peace, love, understanding"", on the other ""russians kill civilians"". No, we don't. If we want to kill someone, we start with ourselves in Gulags or KGB basements."
"begob","8","1","3","9 February 2020"," Free the Rabbit-Hutch One!
","An earnest boy in a comically violent society finds himself in a dilemma when he discovers one of the enemy a bit too close to home.<br/><br/>Unusual comedy that swings between Gunther Grass and Mel Brooks, with a touch of Terry Gilliam, but finds its own peculiar rhythm. I think its main strength is in taking familiar aspects of the end of the war in Germany and giving them a unique angle. As for the comedy, plenty of fruitful set pieces. but only one genuine scream of a laugh just before the final scene. And there is a very touching scene involving shoes and a gallows.<br/><br/>Thematically, the only disappointment is that it didn't nail the lie of race - while it impishly mocked Aryanism and Aryan notions of Jewishness, it shied away from Jewish biblicalism.<br/><br/>There are some problems with the casting, because they use a few known comedians who aren't really film actors, and the lead actor starts off a little wobbly before hitting his stride. Even so, the imaginary friend device works perfectly. Otherwise, the performances are very good, with Rockwell the pick of the bunch.<br/><br/>There is the novelty, for me, of two famous songs performed in German by the original artists, and overall the soundtrack is excellent, not obtrusive. The cinematography is fine, with the Czech urban locations dominating the visual feast.<br/><br/>Overall: light touch on a heavy subject, but the only true movie on this subject remains Come And See.<br/><br/>ps.for fans of J-horror, I think there was a Ju-on joke in there, but it didn't quite work."

","It is the final phase of second world war. The Allies are knocking at the threshold of Germany. But, it is business as usual in Berlin where our protagonist - ten year old Jojo Betzler considers himself the ideal Aryan as he prepares to join a weekend camp of indoctrination by Hitler Youth. The Fuhrer is his greatest idol and also imaginary best friend - a confidante with whom he has several personal conversations and seeks guidance. Jojo lives alone with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) while his father is away fighting in the war.<br/><br/>Jojo aspires to rise through the ranks of Hitler Youth and become a personal bodyguard of the Fuhrer. But, underneath the facade of his Aryan pride, Jojo is a kind and sweet boy who flinches at hurting another being. JoJo's orderly world gets a bolt from the blue when he accidentally discovers that his mother has been hiding a much older jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the attic of their home. Jojo intends to betray Elsa to the authorities and regain some of his lost prestige by winning a medal for the act. But, he faces a dilemma as he feels that it could put his mother in peril.<br/><br/>
Thus unfolds a coming-of-age drama that sees our little Jojo on a journey of self discovery of understanding his beliefs including the systematic indoctrination of hate he was subjected to despite his tender age.<br/><br/>While most parts of the movie breezes through as a well made satire filled with oodles of irreverent and dark humour, these are interspersed with moments which are poignant and underline the grim realities of the time without resorting to any melodrama.<br/><br/>Without being preachy, the movie casts its focus on how ideologies - howsoever well meaning - if let loose, could crush the idiosyncrasies that make us human and could convert us into unthinking automatons under the command of powers that be.<br/><br/>Roman Griffin Davis is endearing and absolutely spot on as the vulnerable Jojo. Scarlett Johansson brings a natural warmth and mirth as JoJo's mother Rosie and richly deserves her Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. The talented Sam Rockwell shines in a short cameo while Waititi is having a whale of a time playing Hitler.<br/><br/>Director Taika Waititi (Thor Ragnarok) has delivered an important movie which, despite being set during second world war, resonates strongly with our own times that is marked by a rising tide of restlessness and distrust across the globe."

","Good movie, it was funny, it was sad, it also did a good job ...for the MOST part to be historically accurate - 10-11 year olds were not asked to fight in the ""Battle of Berlin"", age 14 and up yes, but not little kids.<br/><br/>The Hitler Youth was also not done right at all, they were basically the Boy Scouts of Germany, not taught to be desensitized to war -Germany was actually one of the most civilized nations on Earth (historians still question how this all was able to happen in at that time, a VERY sophisticated Liberal nation), and while the Nazi party was pretty radical, the typical German/German boy was just like anyone else.<br/><br/>That's a minor gripe though because I get that this was a comedy, and they did an excellent job showing the humanity even among those like the Captain. (when he covers for Elsa)<br/><br/>I was very surprised to see overall how accurate the uniforms were, and how at the end they showed the elderly being shown how to defend the city, as this happened. They also showed a brief sense of the brutality of the Soviets - who raped an estimated 2.5 million German women, and murdered millions of people after the war had ended. I'm fully aware Germany did horrible things on the Eastern front, but this film is specifically about Germans.<br/><br/>The Gestapo was done, while for comic effect - well. Even the German military and to an extent even the SS feared them. No, they didn't have to ""Heil Hitler"" like that, lol it was done for comedic effect.<br/><br/>The acting was AMAZING, was never a fan of Scarlett but she was great. Elsa, and JoJo were both awesome as well. Though some accents were very off, such as JoJos adorable friend having an English accent lol. Oh, and Rebel Wilson can be funny! WHO KNEW!!!

That idea sounded great, but then it gets mixed with other story plots and it seems like they wanted to be very funny and dramatic at the same time, and the main plot gets lost in it.

"n-kefala","9","1","3","28 January 2020"," A better world
","Taika Waititi's film (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar) is tender and cruel, bold, clever and surreal and keeps its ambitions under control. It is a satire about the Second World War. This is followed by a lonely boy from Germany whose views of the world around him change when he discovers that his mother hides a young girl of Jewish descent in their home. His fantastic friend on this journey of discovery is... Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>""Jojo Rabbit"" ruthlessly and brutally mocks Hitler and the Nazis, but at the same time treats the issue with respect and seriousness while maintaining a difficult balance. It's a gamble as many could go wrong, yet the film is fun, instructive and accessible to the younger and strangely beautiful. A reminder that love can dominate even in the most difficult situations.<br/><br/>As I watched it bring to mind Benini's masterpiece, ""La vita e bella"" but it doesn't reach that level. However, Taika Waititi, with a fresh look, delivers a distinctive and well-intentioned film that keeps you alert until ... the next ""Thor"" and basically features Griffin Davis and Tomasin McKenzie, two amazingly expressive young actors and Scarlett Johansson who never disappoints us - her nomination for an Academy Award also proves that. Sam Rokwell and Rebel Wilson give the comic touch to the film.<br/><br/>At a time that racism is showing up strongly in many parts of the world, ""Jojo Rabbit"" may be just the movie we need right now. We will laugh, we will be moved, we will not forget the past but we will certainly feel a little better for humanity."

I was expecting a comedy film about Nazis to be widely panned as being grossly offensive but I was pleasantly surprised at the reviews and awards it got nominated for, and I gotta say, it satirised the living crap out of Nazi Germany, while still somehow remaining tasteful, full of heart, sweet and heartbreaking all at the same time.<br/><br/>I've seen a bunch of negative reviews on this film, but reading them, they sure sound like a bunch of downers.<br/><br/>The entire cinema was laughing so hard and I was laughing through tears of sadness as well as tears of joy.

","I'm a big fan of Taika Waititi. His film What We Do In the Shadows is one that I've introduced to so many people and given to just as many as a gift. His take on Thor pretty much changed the Marvel cinematic universe for the better and is the proof of goodness I point to when people naysay superhero films. And he's also been behind some intriguing fare like Eagle vs. Shark, Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, all while playing memorable roles like Korg in the Marvel films, Viago in What We Do In the Shadows and IG-11 in The Mandalorian.<br/><br/>His take on Christine Leunens's book Caging Skies intrigued me from the first previews. While he was slated to work on a live action adaption of Akira - Hollywood won't give up on trying - this was a different movie that needed a deft hand. Luckily, Waititi was that hand.<br/><br/>Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis in his first role) is a ten-year-old boy who is a member of Hitlerjugend, the Nazi youth movement. His father is supposedly fighting on the Italian Front, his sister has recently died and all he has left is his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson). Oh yeah - and his best and imaginary friend, Adolph Hitler (Waititi).<br/><br/>Jojo and his best friend Yorki attend a training camp, run by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell, as always wonderful), who keeps failing at nearly everything. When ordered to kill a rabbit, Jojo finds that he cannot, earning the nickname Jojo Rabbit. To get back in the graces of the other young Nazis, Hitler convinces Jojo to throw a grenade without permission, which gives him facial scars and a limp.<br/><br/>A demoted Klenzendorf is asked by Jojo's mother to include her son, so he is given the job of spreading propaganda and collecting scrap metal.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rosie is hiding Jewish girl Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie, Leave No Trace) in her home. The revelation that Jewish people aren't monsters, as well as the end of the war and his mother's role in being against the Nazis will change Jojo's view of the world.<br/><br/>Notably, every Nazi in the film is comedically ineffective, from Rebel Wilson as Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz and Alfie Allen as the second-in-command Finkel. The town's stand against the Allies and Russians is well-nigh laughable, but also strangely heartbreaking. There's been some criticism that the Nazis are shown in a good light at times in this film and as comedic foils at others. To me, they're shown as objects of derision, paper villains that easily crumble when the real world intrudes. Klenzendorf sees himself as one of the heroic Aryan ideal that winds up in military finery in well-lit paintings with a Wagnerian soundtrack, but the best that he can do is spit in Jojo's face to save his life."
"madbrooks","10","1","3","26 January 2020"," ""I'm going to go home now. I need a cuddle.""
","With Jojo Rabbit Taika Waititi gives us a heart-rending comedy about a ten-year German during the last days of WWII. The film is delightfully goofy - Taika kills it as JoJo's imaginary friend Adolph Hitler - but then hits you hard with the true horrors of the Nazi regime. Jojo Rabbit is a wonderful satire supported by a brilliant cast."
"josephinostaliphino","9","1","3","24 January 2020"," Very good movie
","This movie is great. A perfect example that Comedy can be spiced with history. Of course there are things that are 100% imagined by the director like Roman-like suit or a gatling gun or a bunch of aryan clones in the hitlerjugend Headquarters. And there is historical innacuracy, like the Panzershrek rockets exploding with a rather big radius (until it hit a ammo storage) , kids using REAL M24 grenades for TRAINING , and surviving a blast from one thats half a meter in front of you (im not kidding, it only resulted in a minor leg injury and a bunch of scars on your face, even it the grenade has barely any fragmentation effects). Other than that, the movie has only a few sad parts. The boy talks with imaginary hitler, they burn books and stuff. This movie wont make you laugh very loudly but rather make you smile more than usual. Great representation of volkssturm and Hitlerjugend or Jungvolk as in the movie. Female hitlerjugend having problems with using a MP3008. Ms bertha strapping grenades to kids and telling them to hug enemy soldiers (xD) or telling Yorki he got ""promoted"" and gives him a pistol. I got a little bit triggered with the MG42 carried by Bertha. The firerate is waaaay to slow and she just doesnt give a crap and hip-fires it. Of course, No recoil. Good to watch with your family.

"dchipoco","9","1","3","24 January 2020"," A satire for the time
","Waititi gives the audience a strong reflection on fascism and war through the innocence of a 10-year-old fanatic German boy living in the final year of World War II. The humor is a mask, under which a strong message accompanied with short but forceful dialogues, tender acting and feeling is hidden. The acting of all characters is amazing, specially Scarlett Johansson as a mother who resembles humanism in the middle of the atrocities of wars and the brainwashed mindset of the German culture of those days, a mother who tries to teach her boy what she can without disturbing the inner path he choose to walk. Even though her acting stands out, she does not opaque the children actors who personificate tender, struggle and suffering. The opening titles were one of the best I've seen in the last year and the final scene was simple and innocent, but yet full of significance. The humor was well managed, yes, Waititi makes fun on the extremism of the time; but is well used, not disrespectful nor overwhelming, it is precise, and does not disturbs the main message of the film. Perhaps, there were some elements that could have been used in a better way, like the German accent so well used in Inglorious Bastards, but overall Waititi presents a piece of art, a risky project that could divide the opinion of both, critic and audience, but which reminds us of the atrocities of the past, the history that should never be forgotten."

","This was a Movie I Wasn't Excited for But after Watching it It's Hilarious this Makes me even more excited to see what Taika Waititi Does Next both Star Wars and Marvel Overall I Highly Recommend this Funny Film for Everyone"
"Shnort_Reviews45","9","1","3","23 January 2020"," Terrific Satire
","Taika Waititi's latest satirical take on the Nazi youth is heart wrenching, hilarious and beautiful.
Despite my fears that the film was going to go down the route of using the shocking subject matter to
compensate for poor writing or to get a cheap laugh through dark comedy, This film once again
showed the world that Taika Watiti is one of the most talented and comical directors of the modern
day. In the plot we follow our 10yr old main character JoJo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) as he
aspires towards becoming one of Adolf Hitler's Elite Guards, however his progress towards his goal
was quickly Hampered by a devastating injury and the discovery of what his mother (Scarlet
Johanson) has been hiding right under his nose... .
Roman Griffin Davis gave stellar performance as the title character, helping convey that the young
manipulated boy has a heart of gold outside of the diabolical brainwashing he has endured. Scarlet
Johanson gave it her all as JoJo's rebellious mother, portraying a kind and resilient parent. However, it
is undeniable that Taika Watiti as a 10yr old's perception of Hitler steals the show from start to finish,
as he makes arguably the worst man to walk the earth seem likeable. Other notable performances
would have to go to Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa Korr, a Jewish girl being housed in secret by jojo's
mother and Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, a disgraced Nazi higher up put in charge of the
training of the Nazi youth.
The writing of the film is simply sublime, with funny quotables left and right, Watiti's dark comedic style
really shines through every inch of the film. A great example of this is when JoJo unwittingly blows
himself up with a grenade after being inspired by imaginary Hitler to be more courageous. Yet the film
is also great at showing that it has heart, mainly seem through Jojo and his mother's heartwarming
relationship and the sibling like love between Jojo and Elsa. The film portrays its subject manner
graciously, as it holds nothing back when poking fun at the Nazis, yet the true despicableness of them
is never shied away from
The streets of 1940s Germany are portrayed in a very colourful fashion mostly due to amazing set
design and beautiful cinematography. Extra care seemed to be given to make every set lit perfectly for
the scene and time period, as well as having every uniform as realistic as possible to add to this
believable setting. The film looks very crisp and refreshing, most likely because of the lack of terrible
CGI and great use of angles.
Overall JoJo Rabbit is a great satire that doesn't rely on cheap laughs and shock value to deliver its
anti-hate message in an amusing fashion, with terrific performances and great writing JoJo Rabbit may
be one of the best satires of the decade

","JoJo Rabbit is not only one of the most unique film concepts of the year but also one of the best films of the year in general. Taika Waititi's amazing directing and script make this film its own and it wouldn't be the same without him. His comedic flare brightens an otherwise darkly conceptual portrayal of WWII. Roman Griffin Davis' performance as JoJo is easily one of the best performances of the year, making me laugh and cry. He brings the energy and charm to every scene, all the actors in fact have phenomenal chemistry with each other and deliver the zany comedy with perfection. The pacing is well executed and the tone is surprisingly strong for a comedy film about Nazis. This film also couldn't have come at a better time in this political climate, talking about what's right and wrong and what it means to be a human and what value each person can contribute and if that contribution is for better or for worse. The setting immerses you and brings you into Germany. This film is easily the Best of the Year and should win Best Picture at the Oscars; despite its inevitable failure on that spectrum. This film makes you feel and that's what counts..."

"gtessarini","9","1","3","18 January 2020"," One of the best and funniest self critic to nazi
","An actor of Jewish descent playing Hitler in a film that he writes, produces and directs. Honestly, it couldn't be better!<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is not about the Nazi dictator, but about Jojo, a 10-year-old German boy who has the tyrant as an imaginary friend during the end of World War II. Jojo is another member of the Hitlerist Youth indoctrinated to praise blindly his country, his prejudices, his leader and the Reich, even in the decay of war. And it is with a lot of acid comedy and black humor that the work satirizes this, pointing out all the lunatic fanaticism that permeated the Nazis of that time - And of the present times.<br/><br/>With an excellent timing for the satirical strips, jokes and direct criticisms that flow in the speeches of the characters and in the montage of the scenes, with the right to mention the ""Aryan"" clones that the Nazis tried to produce and that needed to ""go for a walk"", the comedy Jojo Rabbit, based on a literary drama, treats the delicate subject of World War II terror with great care and comic mastery.<br/><br/>There is a fine line between what can be approached without disrespect to those attacked by the Holocaust and between apologies for that movement, and the film works on it in a very clever way - perhaps only seen before in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Bastards.<br/><br/>With the core of the narrative the young fanatic 10 years old who finds a Jewish girl being hidden by his mother in his own home, the film shows Jojo starting an internal debate, sympathy for the fugitive and, consequently, empathy and humanity for her . Jojo's progress in putting reason in the place of ideological fanaticism is a comic and striking statement against prejudice and growing discrimination in the present day since the horrors that happened in the 1940s.<br/><br/>The most delicate point when making a work of this type is the question of the appropriation of lives that could be insulted depending on its presentation. By focusing on the core of the boy and his imaginary Nazi friend, the only really appropriate life in Jojo Rabbit is that of Adolf Hitler himself who is recreated and debauched in a stubborn, clueless, cowardly and cartoonish version coming directly from a child's imagination. , in a very necessary way.<br/><br/>Featuring Nazis blind to common sense and the country's situation and believers only to what they didn't even see, the unreal caricatures of their enemies, the Jews, the film humorously emphasizes the Nazi prejudice and ignorance that he blamed, without no logic, to other peoples due to unusual situations that were actually caused by themselves, as in the case of a fat uncle, drunkard and gambler who only did what he did because he had been ""hypnotized by the powers of the Jews"".<br/><br/>With a production of realistic scenarios and a soundtrack from the 80's, this modern work that covers a fiction located in the 40's and with reflections in the current reality has the excellent performance of the young Roman Griffin Davis, who plays Jojo, of the world star Scarlett Johansson in the role of her zealous and spontaneous mother, and Taika Waititi who signs the work, gives paper and criticizes, for being exaggerated and ridiculous who Hitler was and how his ideas sounded.<br/><br/>What incredible irony! A film full of swastikas and intended to show their idiocy."

"Belldogg81","9","1","3","14 January 2020"," Die Arbeit von Taika wird dich zum Lachen und Weinen bringen.
","In a solid year for films, particularly those at the business end of the awards season Jojo Rabbit stands out a mile. Mining the most horrific period in modern history for laughs is not to be attempted lightly. This film however manages to combine genuine belly laughs and consistent chuckles with real heart. For this alone it deserves all the praise it has received.<br/><br/>It splices the emotion of Spielberg (without the schmaltz), the slapstick of Python (without the real silliness) and the off beat characterisation of the Coen Brothers and filters it all through Waititi's unique comedic voice.<br/><br/>Anyone who has followed Waititi's career as I have from Flight of the Conchords through to Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor Ragnarok will see elements of all of these laced subtlety and more overtly through Jojo. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is probably the closest thing to a companion piece in that they are both driven by a child navigating a grown ups world and both deliver laughs and tears.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer or know a little of the film then the story is basically one of Jojo, a passionate Hitler Youth member who in the absence of siblings and a father imagines himself none other than Der Fuhrer as a friend.<br/><br/>He is of course played by the director Taiki Waititi in what can only be described a a unique take on history's worst human. The interplay between him and Jojo (played brilliantly by Roman Griffin Davis in incredibly his first film role) propels the first act as Jojo seeks to become the very model of the HitlerJugend. Bright eyed, inmocent, cherubic and full of zest he fantasies in his bedroom of glory while dressed in his uniform as any young boy the world over would do dressed as their favourite sports star or singer.<br/><br/>We soon meet Sam Rockwell as the youth camp captain. As always he delivers, bringing a little of his character in Billboards to what is essentially the shell of a once proud Nazi no longer able to take part in combat due to an injury. He is a shambling, drunken but still wily man who manages to dole out advice to our young protagonist even though you are aware he is maybe not entirely on board with the party line.<br/><br/>Scarlett Joahnsson plays Jojo's Mother and is utterly charming as a single parent trying to keep her child a child while keeping him safe. She is playful, tough and teaches Jojo that there's more to life than Hitler and the war. She also has her secrets which give the film it's weight and most heartbreaking scene.<br/><br/>The real centerpiece of the film though is the relationship between Jojo and Elsa (another brilliant performance from a young actress I first seen in Leave no Trace and again excels here). Her discovery by Jojo begins to really anchor the direction of the film and is deftly played by the director as initial fear and horror are soon turned into curiosity and friendship. Much to the chagrin of Jojo's imaginary friend. (Worth noting at this point that Jojo's only real friend up to this point is Yoki who is a relentlessly optimistic delight and delivers much of the film's comic relief, even when things get really heavy).<br/><br/>As Jojo and Elsa's relationship blooms the spectre of the war machine's most insidious parts are never too far away and it is not long before an impromptu home inspection from the local Gestapo takes place.<br/><br/>Despite being played largely for laughs at the start it becomes genuinely tense as Thomasin McKenzie playing Elsa conveys all the inner turmoil and resilience as expertly as an actress far beyond her years. The scene drips in Pathos but as is the genius of Waititi, things are never allowed to get too heavy and we are soon chuckling again thanks to Stephen Merchant and his band of hapless goons.<br/><br/>The film begins to draw to a close as Jojo is left bereft and begins to lose what's left of his faith in the war. He resolves to protect his Jewish stowaway at all costs. As the Red army encircle the city and break through the last of the defences the final scene plays out like an old fashioned farce with young and old alike strapped with guns and bombs they can barely carry never mind operate. In actuality anyone with a cursory knowledge of Berlin's last stand will know this isn't as ridiculous as it seems.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf finally realises his heroic potential as the survivors (Jojo included) are rounded up by the Red Army. He knowingly creates a skirmish with Jojo which he knows will set Jojo free but result in his death. It's played brilliantly and Jojo is free to return home to his beloved Elsa.<br/><br/>Torn between telling her the truth and risk her exercising her new freedom and telling her a lie to keep her close, his inner conflict is there for all to see. He ultimately does the right thing and they step outside together for the first time in a new Germany and much changed world. This however is not before a final reckoning between Jojo and the ghost of his imaginary friend. Hardened by what he has been through and completely enchanted by Elsa, he delivers the film's final hilarious, punch the air moment.<br/><br/>If this does not win best picture it will not be a major surprise given the Academy's form for playing it safe with the Oscar's. But make no mistake, in years to come this will be the one people will say should have won.<br/><br/>A triumph, Heil Waititi!!!"

","Jojo Rabbit is about a young German boy called Jojo who joins the Hitler Youth but after being bullied by people higher up he ran away and talked to his imaginary best friend, Adolf Hitler. Jojo soon returns, taking a hand grenade, throwing it and accidentally blowing himself up which makes him unfit for the German army so he is restored to staying home and getting a job delivering conscription papers and putting up propaganda flyers. However, he soon discovers a jew hiding in his house and discovers what jews are truly like.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is a comedic masterpiece. The casting is amazing and full of talent, the script was brilliant, the pacing was almost perfect and the visuals and cinematography were incredible. This movie is truly going to be a classic that people will watch over and over again for many years to come. It is hilarious but serious and shows exactly what it was like to be a Nazi and a Jew during the second World War while also being humours at the right moments. It shows what the Nazi's has perceived Jews to be and how incorrect they were.<br/><br/>The movie has many emotional parts that are not in any way overshadowed by the comedy. Roman Davis did an outstanding job as Jojo, especially at such a young age and in such a complex role. The character of Jojo goes through a huge change during this movie.<br/><br/>However, no movie can be perfect and this is my only complaint about Jojo Rabbit; at some points during the first act the pacing felt a little weird and it took a while for the movie to fully progress, however it is only a small nitpick and can easily be overlooked<br/><br/>Final Rating: 9/10"

I believe this is the first time I've seen either actor in a film and boy did I love them! Yorkie was a great source of comic relief and I found myself smiling every time he appeared on screen. All these young actors were SO good! ScarJo and Rockwell were fantastic as well. Waititi's take on Hitler was hilarious and had me dying.<br/><br/>My two favorite scenes was the one with the grenade and the one with the shoes. Great examples of balancing emotion and humor.

"c-kelsall","9","1","3","13 January 2020"," Close to perfection
","I knew I was going to love Jojo Rabbit when I saw the trailer and read about the premise, and I was even more certain when I realised it was directed by Taika Waititi. How long does he have to wait for some Oscars or something? The man is a borderline genius.
I suppose some people will never accept that Nazism and the Holocaust can ever be used to get laughs, but what this film does so well is ridicule their hateful ideology and show it up for the absurdity that it was. That must go in no small measure to the book upon which the film is based, but it still had to be adapted, and in fine style too. The horrors of the latter days of WWII are portrayed unflinchingly, and in those moments of course the humour gives way to pathos. The way in which these two elements of the film are balanced is particularly clever; at no point did I feel like my emotions were being cynically manipulated for kudos.
The acting in Jojo Rabbit is superb. Scarlett Johansson thoroughly deserves her Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Jojo's struggling mother, determined to remain independent and hopeful of an end to the war, despite Nazism and her own son's insistence on being a staunch Hitler Youth. The child actors are also very good (although I'm not sure the Jewish girl Elsa could be said to be played by a child actor, since Thomasin McKenzie is 19), and the supporting cast do good work with their various and peculiar characters - the jolly yet creepy Gestapo man (Stephen Merchant), the cavalier but comradely commander of the local Hitler Youth (Sam Rockwell) and his limp sidekick (Alfie Allen), and of course the significant presence of Waititi himself as Jojo's imaginary friend Adolf Hitler! He did a great job of portraying Hitler as Jojo imagined him to be, and I liked the way the Hitler persona changes as Jojo grows up a bit and becomes acquainted with harsh reality.
The one character which I didn't relate to and couldn't see the point of was Rebel Wilson's Nazi instructor with the Hitler Youth. I'm not a fan of Rebel Wilson, but I don't think it was her spoiling the role, just that the character was superfluous.
In pretty much every other respect I thought Jojo Rabbit was beautifully satirical and poignant in equal measure, and I urge everyone to see it!"
"littlegirlbunny","9","1","3","13 January 2020"," Particularly Good, Quirky Satire

","This movie really touched me. I was sceptical about a satirical treatment of such a serious topic as Nazism and the treatment of Jews. The story gripped me from the start with the unusual concept of having Hitler as an imaginary friend of a coming-of-age boy. But the moral dilemma he faces is supported with great performances, weight and emotions, funny dialog and decisive moral choices.
This is not a light movie but one that reaffirms the power of humanity."
"helenbassett","10","1","3","12 January 2020"," JoJo Rabbit Film Review - Taika Waititi Directs Scarlett Johansson Doing Whatever She Can With A Hitler Mad Son, A Ghost In The Attic And Sam Rockwell Leading The German Camp
","In the dying days of the Nazi Third Reich Taiki Waititi creates a film that lets us laugh at the comic Nazis, but throws in moments of peril. They might be goons during this springtime in Germany, but they still have guns.<br/><br/>Young Roman Griffin Davis's 10 year old JoJo is best friends with Taika Waititi's imaginary Hitler, and we meet the F√ºhrer encouraging timid JoJo to attend the local Hitler Youth Camp, with his 'second best friend' Yorki, played by Archie Yates. Both outsiders and happily so, running like demented leprechauns in the woods with the wacky Adolf.<br/><br/>The camp is designed for boys to learn to hunt, shoot and kill for Hitler, while the girls learn domestic science and how to be good Aryan mothers. Much to their disappointment! Rebel Wilson is hilarious as Fraulein Rahm. 18 babies for Hitler and counting. And Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf is comically brilliant, wounded earlier on the front line he now trains the Hitler Youth. With assistance from his Sergeant Finkel, played by Alfie Allen. A good German couple best keeping quiet. And our own good little German, so full of his hero worship and desire to serve Adolf, but cannot quite bring himself to kill a poor little rabbit. Hence the unfortunate nickname he picks up, as well as a hand grenade. This daring and (funny) action that nearly kills him, may just have saved his life.<br/><br/>Having Hitler as an imaginary friend is a pretty extreme affliction, but Taiki Waititi's Hitler does, among the Heil Hitlering, offer JoJo moments of support when he needs it most. Encouraged him to go to camp and JoJo Rabbit will be as welcome in the Third Reich as a lion. All helping the lonely boy.<br/><br/>Back home and off school recovering, the scarred and limping JoJo, no longer able to fulfil his dream to become one of Hitler's bodyguards, and still unable to tie his shoelaces, is taken by his mother Rosie to the local army office. Played by Scarlett Johansson, Rosie insists, in no uncertain terms, that Captain Klenzendorf include and make use of JoJo. And makes Klenzendorf, having been demoted there after the grenade incident, feel her and JoJo's pain!<br/><br/>While JoJo continues learning how to be a good Nazi with Hitler. Jews are bad, of course they are in Nazi Germany. But how do you know if you have met one? And what would you do if you did? For the small German town is a colourful and happy place for JoJo growing up, with no Jewish monsters lurking anywhere. And Rosie looking after her confused son, and washing down the craziness of her life with a bottle of red. Scarlett Johansson on top form.<br/><br/>But there are more ways to be a good German in Nazi Germany. Although many of them will get you hung in the town square. What did they do? JoJo asks Rosie. Whatever they could! And when JoJo finds 'ghost' Thomasin McKenzie in the attic eaves of his dead sister's room, he has a crisis of his Nazi faith. If he reports her, young Elsa warns him, it won't be just her who will be taken away, so will his beloved mother who has hidden her. So they agree to keep secret that JoJo knows about Elsa in the attic. While Rosie tells Elsa in their secret night meetings that JoJo is such a committed Nazi they cannot let him know. So begins the comedy of errors as JoJo and Elsa meet secretly every day for her to tell him all about being a Jew. Things like how she hangs upside down like a bat and will have horns when she's older. And she can read minds too. Although not German minds of course, they are too stupid! All details for the book JoJo is writing for Hitler. And perhaps moments of comedy and joy for the fragile Elsa, who has the heart of a lion, but whose very existence is dependent on this strange little 10 year old. And Elsa is a good influence on JoJo, with Adolf losing his grip on the love struck boy. And not happy about it. But Jewish Elsa may not be the monster after all, not when the Russians coming from the East allegedly eat people! Pick your villains wisely JoJo.<br/><br/>And while JoJo collects the town pots and pans as 'scrap' metal for Germany, Yorki is conscripted to the army and dressed in his new paper like uniform; cardboard! We know that the Reich is nearly done, sending prepubescent boys to fight. What a hoot Archie Yates is though, soon to be seen in the Home Alone reboot, and could have almost won the war singlehandedly for the Allies. But when Stephen Merchant and his Gestapo goons visit the house, the Heil Hitler comedy suddenly gets serious. With Klenzendorf and Fingel also turning up unexpectedly. One would almost think something was up. And as the house is searched, Elsa is found.<br/><br/>It seems far enough away from the horrors of WWII to be able to laugh, but at the time there was nothing funny about Elsa's experience. Yet Taiki has reimagined the horrors through the innocent eyes of a 10 year old, and cleverly turned them into laugh out loud comedy. After recounting his 'imaginary' interrogations of Elsa, Klenxendorf finds JoJo's ludicrous descriptions of Jewish people hilarious. And the sight of Klenxendorf and Finkel racing into battle with their trademarked uniforms, against the newly arrived Americans and Russians, was a camp sight to behold.<br/><br/>With a terrific cast of children the film had tremendous heart, and our hope that JoJo will do the right thing plays until the end. The vulnerable Elsa totally dependent on his decisions. We want him to be a good German just like Rosie. And he definitely needs a good slap. (Of course this was a different time!). But eventually there is hope."

Although at its heart it so satirical, it gives an excellent insight into the thinking within Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>This film excellently walks the line between offence and satire, through the medium of comedy it demonstrates the successful use of propaganda in Nazi Germany while also maintains a story of love and redemption.<br/><br/>There is never a dull moment in this film, you're either laughing or thinking.<br/><br/>On top of this, the acting is superb, Roman Griffin Davis in particular superbly conveys the emotion of a child during this period and is complimented by Archie Yates who, dare I say it, played the funniest character I ever ever witnessed on the big screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a must see and will become a future classic."

","Now I am not a fan of children in films so approached this with more than a soup√ßon of trepidation. Well you can shoot me down in flames - Roman Griffin Davis is superb, simply superb. Can an 11 year old get an Oscar nomination? The story is quite surreal; a young Hitlerjugend (Nazi youth) discovers that his mother is harbouring a young Jewish girl under the eaves of their roof. What should he do? He's got Taika Waititi (aka Hitler) in his head preaching Nazi Arian philosophy at him whilst his own humanity (and curiosity) is guiding him elsewhere. Scarlett Johansson and the slightly sexually ambiguous pairing of Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen are great at keeping the whole thing going and it's funny and inventive from start to finish. Special mentions for Archie Yates as his pal ""Yorki"" and Davis' acting coach Rachel House who has done a splendid job."
"Pairic","9","1","3","10 January 2020"," A Triumph!
","Jojo Rabbit: How to describe this film? A serious comedy infused with elements of fantasy? It will have you laughing but the chuckles will die in your throat as you observe the final weeks of the Third Reich in a German town. Pensioners and children are armed with panzerfausts and rifles, ""traitors"" are hanged, the Gestapo hunt Jews until the very end. These could be scenes from Downfall.<br/><br/>Ten year old Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is an ardent member of the Hitler Youth who has an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). This comical Hitler hangs out with Jojo, encourages him in his efforts, comforts him when he is bullied at the Hitler Youth weekend camp. The camp is run by invalided Captain Klenzdorf (Sam Rockwell) along with his shell-shocked assistant Sub-Officer Finkel (Alfie Allen) and the crazed Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) who has borne 18 Aryan babies for the Reich, a great comic trio. The bullying is by teenage HY members though and Jojo suffers injuries from a premature grenade explosion.<br/><br/>Jojo's mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) appears to be a model Nazi but she is hiding a Jewish teenager, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), and engaging in resistance activities. Jojo discovers Elsa's hiding place and at first his simple nazi ideology is to the fore but they gradually develop a tentative relationship. Elsa showing that she is no victim but someone whose people wrestled with angels and killed giants. Truly great performances by McKenzie and Davis.<br/><br/>The humour ranges from a Tommy Cooper style skit where Rosie plays two parts to Mel Brookes type humour: (i) his slapstick mode where the imaginary Hitler is hamming, recoiling from a wall in case Jews are hiding in it, (ii) the serious comedy of To Be Or Not To Be when Jojo must fool the Gestapo. But these comparisons don't take away from the genius of Waititi's script, timing and direction.<br/><br/>Writer/Director/Actor Taika Waititi has delivered a comic triumph which literally and metaphorically deposits the nazis in the dustbin of history. 9/10."

","One of the few much awaited 2019's movies I didn't get to see before making my ""Top 10 of the year"" lists, but boy was it sure to end up there. ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a beautiful blend of dark and inventive satire, sweet and dear themes of childhood, romance and parenting & hilariously wacky comedy, as well as another great addition to Taika Waititi's successful and heartful filmography.<br/><br/>I think it's fair to say that ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a brave movie, it hits the nail right on the head by clothing the controversial nazi themes in a creative anti-hate satire - and #@%k those critics who saw something else, I wholeheartedly disagree that ""the terrible truth gets buried in this movie"".<br/><br/>You kinda see where most of the story will go & all the inevitabilities, but it's well tailored, dynamic and very enjoyable. Waititi orchestrates the whole concept gloriously well. The entire cast provides lively and awesome performances, Roman Griffin Davis shines in what could be one of the best child actor performances, Scarlett Johanson and Sam Rockwell amused me endlessly, Taika Waititi himself always knows exactly what he's doing, and, fact is, nothing but props to the whole cast. Pacing's even, action's awesome & the story provides a good chance that you'll both laugh and cry. On a side note, I was very mistaken by thinking all this time that Taika Waititi wrote the story himself, little did I know it's actually based on a novel. Every aesthetical value of ""Jojo Rabbit"" adds to it greatly, the production design is all thought through to the detail, cinematography's solid & so is original score along with the soundtrack, from which three songs have already been added to my playlists.<br/><br/>""Jojo Rabbit"" is an emotional drama while also being a hilarious and sweet comedy, and, surely, it's one of the better satire examples in filmmaking. It felt like falling somewhere between a 9 and a 10, but then they ended it with my favorite David Bowie song, and, well, that does it. My rating: 10/10."

","A story about the life of a young aspiring nazi boy and he's struggles when discoving that he's mother is helping a jew... Oh and hes imaginary best friend hitler (played by waititi) is there along the way.<br/><br/>I think that sums up what's so brilliant about this movie and Waititi's vision, Hollywood is filled with the same copy and pasted films and remakes and this is just such a breathe of fresh air! The film is paced amazingly throughout and despite the serious and deep nature of what the film is portraying it truly is hilariously funny whilst still managing to pull on your heart stings! I spent the duration of the film with tears from laughter or sadness.<br/><br/>This film really is for true film lovers and portrays so much emotion! Waititi's brilliance is matched by some of the best performances by many great actors with one of the best performances I've seen from Scarlett Johansson by far! it's a 10/10 for sure."

"MOscarbradley","5","1","3","8 January 2020"," A film of two halves....
","In 1940 The Little Tramp was a Jewish barber living under the shadow of Nazism and his alter ego, Charlie Chaplin was Adolf Hitler, or rather Adenoid Hynkel, ""The Great Dictator"" since, even in a Chaplin comedy in 1940, poking actual fun at 'Hitler' himself might have seemed out of the question. A couple of years later, while the War was still ongoing. Ernst Lubitsch made ""To Be or Not to Be"". another very funny about the Nazis that even included the line, 'So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt', and in 1968 Mel Brooks had the temerity to stage a bad-taste musical called 'Springtime for Hitler' in his film ""The Producers"" with a spaced-out hippy called L.S.D as Hitler. The film was pronounced the funniest film ever made by Peter Sellers and roundly condemned by the British critic Dilys Powell who found the whole idea repulsive.<br/><br/>The point is that Hollywood has always seen fit to take something as monstrous as Nazism and make fun of it. Actual Holocaust jokes they have stayed clear of though the Italian Roberto Benigni had no such qualms when he made ""Life is Beautiful"". Hollywood applauded him with a number of Oscars. Now it's the turn of the New Zealand born writer, director and actor Taika Waititi who has combined the Mel Brooks approach with the Benigni approach in his movie ""JoJo Rabbit"" with very mixed results.<br/><br/>In these supposedly more politically enlightened times the argument has run, is it right to joke about Hitler and the Nazis and most of ""JoJo Rabbit's"" critics have tended to come from the moral Right and to give Mr Waititi his dues he has pushed the boat out here. The hero is a ten year old member of the Hitler Youth whose imaginary friend is none other than the Fuhrer himself and he's played by Waititi much in the style of Dick Shawn's L.S.D. Indeed, the first thiry minutes or so are very funny if, like me, you enjoy bad taste and have a Brooksian sense of humour and then it all goes disasterously wrong. Waititi gets serious with a major sub-plot involving a young Jewish girl hiding in the attic, (a kind of Anne Frank minus the family), and our youthful hero undergoes a change of heart from Nazi sympathiser to love-struck puppy while there are long, glum patches with not a laugh in sight but much squirming in the seat. It does pick up a little towards the end with the reintroduction of some more bad tasted gags and scenes that resemble a kind of comic version of ""Germany Year Zero"" but by then I had basically given up the ghost.<br/><br/>On the plus side it is very well acted. When he's not required to be serious young Roman Griffin Davis is fine as JoJo though it's Archie Yates as his friend Yorki who comes close to stealing the movie. Scarlett Johansson is also superb as JoJo's mother, a German sympathiser to the Jewish cause while Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant are both brilliant as 'comic' Nazis, one basically a nice guy and the other just the kind of Nazi we all love to hate and Rebel Wilson is splendidly over-the-top as a Nazi who is basically just a baby-making machine. As the girl in the attic, Thomasin McKenzie is basically wasted.
So a film of two halves, the better half being the tasteless one when the villains are reduced to ludicrous caricatures. When he puts on his serious face, however, Waititi just ends up by being scantimonious."

"jamesmoule","7","1","3","8 January 2020"," Anne Frank meets Colonel Klink
","Drawn by the trailer, I approached this movie expecting perhaps too much. It was not very humorous and neither was it particularly novel. The concept is fine but the execution (no spoiler intended) didn't quite succeed.
I see that Waititi has been nominated for awards for adapting the screenplay. I am now reading the book, ""Caging Skies"" and there is some similarity with the film but many differences. The focus is on different characters. The book is far from being a comedy. In ""Caging Skies"", Adolf Hitler does not appear as an imaginary friend. Johannes is much older, 14 - 20. The film uses only the first half of the book. There are many scenes that are not in the book.
The characters are stereotypical, as in the TV series ""Hogan's Heroes"" but the leads, especially Jo Jo and Scarlet Johannsen, are excellent.
This is a quirky movie and quite enjoyable but less than it might have been."

","Of all the things that I had watched the previous year, Jojo Rabbit overwhelmed most of them with an utterly unexpected surprise. A recent satire of a film that was officially released during October, 2019, Jojo Rabbit describes the life of a young kid named, Johannes 'Jojo' Betzler (portrayed by Roman Griffin Davis), who was involved into Hilter's Youth camp during the final years of the Third Reich.<br/><br/>Based on the book named Caging Skies by author Christine Leunens, the movie revolves around Jojo and his imaginary friend Hitler himself (thankfully he was the pigmentation of Jojo's thoughts, deviated and satirical on the screen), plotting around Jojo's life as a devoted Nazi. As the story progresses, ten-year-old Jojo begins experiencing the truth behind the Nazi regime and begins to doubt the whole thing. Well, enough with the synopsis.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit despite a comedy-drama, reminded of acclaimed films from the older days like Das Boot (1981), Schindler's List (1993), The Pianist (2002), and Downfall (2004), relating to the evils and flaws surrounding the infamous Third Reich of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. But Jojo Rabbit brought in a perspective that was unknown to the audience. It played along with a serious plot where things could've gone wrong in the smallest mistakes. Indeed, Nazi Germany is remembered as a black-part of modern history, and people might not agree with the film's portrayal. But in personal opinion, it was done in a much-justified manner, despite the historical facts.<br/><br/>Amazing acting work by Roman Griffin Davis, Taika Waititi (also the director) and Scarlett Johansson, along with special mentions to Sam Rockwell, who had portrayed Captain K. Some of the elements in the film may have seemed obvious, but some of the comic scenes were simply hilarious and original (eg - the Yorki Panzerschreck scene). I was pretty much hooked into the film from the beginning, mostly for the uncanny satiric depiction of all the characters in the given scenarios. Despite being a comedy-drama, there were intense scenes that gave the movie more reasons to understand in depth.<br/><br/>A genuine movie in most of its run-time with happy and down moment. It was indeed a really wonderful and enjoyable experience to watch the whole way. If you are sensitive to subjects related to Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, or the Second World War, do employ discretion.

"southdavid","7","1","3","6 January 2020"," Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
","On the whole, I feel positively about ""Jojo Rabbit"", though I do accept and can see the reasons why some people might not enjoy it.<br/><br/>As the WW2 turns against the Germans, young Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) a committed if incapable member of the Hitler Youth, discovers that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish Girl in her attic. Torn between his desire to be a good Nazi and to not get his mother in trouble, Jojo's life is complicated further by his imaginary friend, the Furher himself (Taika Waititi) who tells him that Jews cannot be trusted.<br/><br/>So, the positives first. Roman Davis is great and his relationships with all the other characters is spot on. The film is gently funny, rather than a laugh riot, which is absolutely the right call and helps make the shifts to tragedy less jarring than they otherwise might be. The do still resonate though. Despite being a focus for the films marketing, Jojo's relationship with Hitler is actually a relatively minor part of the film, it could even have been dropped altogether without losing much, maybe just a little clarity on Jojo's thinking about his guest.<br/><br/>I don't see what there is to find offensive, the film is clearly meant to be a parody and is patently absurd for most of its runtime.<br/><br/>So why not a perfect review?<br/><br/>It is, for my money, a little heavy handed with its story, each committed Nazi is ridiculous, in their own way. A few aspects of the farce wear a little thin, as the show goes on. Sam Rockwell's battle armour, for example, just doesn't tie in with the character we've seen leading up to it. It also doesn't really have anything new to say. Innocence being the first casualty of war is a long acknowledged idea.<br/><br/>That said, I enjoyed the experience."

"darrenbjones","10","1","3","5 January 2020"," Brilliant, funny, touching, sad, hopeful and heartwarming.
","It's the latter stages of the war but despite this, the Reich continues to present itself as winning and the spell that Adolf Hitler has over the German people is still strong. JoJo is a ten year old boy who, like many children, see the world in a very simple fashion. Hitler is good and Jews are bad. As a member of the Hitler youth he wants to be a good Nazi and has Adolf Hitler as an imaginary friend.
An accident at camp leaves him stuck at home where he discovers there is a Jewish girl hiding in his house. From this point on JoJo is forced to confront the grey areas of the world. Jews might not be evil monsters, how can his worldview be perfect if his Mother is hiding enemies of the state? How can he do his duty like a good Nazi if the consequences would likely be the arrest and execution of his mother?
Through this device, JoJo slowly uncovers the truth about the Nazi party and his childlike worldview moves from black and white to a more nuanced understanding.
If this sounds like heavy material it is, but this is also a very funny satire and Taika Waititi manages to dance the fine line between keeping this funny and touching, without making it depressing or treating the material without the necessary seriousness. Roman Griffin Davis is fantastic as JoJo, as is Thomasin Mackenzie as Elsa. Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell give wonderful performances and the rest of the cast, Stephen Merchant as a Gestapo agent, Alfie Allen as Captain Klenzendorf's Lieutenant, Rebel Wilson as a militant Nazi instructor and Archie Yates as JoJo' s friend Yorki. Taika Waititi does double duties as Director and as JoJo's imaginary Hitler who slowly transforms from supportive imaginary childlike friend to frenzied German Chancellor imaginary friend.
Brilliant, funny, touching, sad, hopeful and heartwarming."

All the actors/actresses were great - even Rebel Wilson who I am not a big fan of. I really thought that the first half of the film reminded me of a Wes Anderson film because of its quirkiness but then it developed a style of its own. Taika as Hitler was the perfect choice and achieved a great balance - both funny and serious at the same time but not too horrible (considering it's Hitler he is portraying). Thomason is brilliant as the Jewish girl and Scarlett Johannsen is always good. Roman was brilliant and I look forward to seeing what he does next.

Roman Griffin Davis delivers the best child performance I've ever seen in a movie. His delivery is always perfect and he's never wooden.

The movie prevails in telling an emotionally rich comedy about anti hate and a kid whose imaginary friend is the one balled warlord. Overall a very good movie with rich comedy and a story that on the surface looks funny but is much deeper and better than anything I could've predicted. 9/10"

","I've been a member of IMDB for years and it's my first time writing a review.
The movie is hilarious, while incredibly heavy.
While you're laughing, you also feel the heartbreaking pain.
While normal war movie makes you hold breath and is hard to bear. JoJo Rabbit portraits the whole madness and darkness in a funny way, highlighting humanity.
Every single actor is superb! Director & screenplay is genius.
In a war, there is no winner.
Remember the pain and be grateful for what we have and living in the moment for a wonderful life."

","This movie has made me feel so good from the beginning to the end, and still after watching the movie. I've never watched a movie that made me feel good especially with the movies based on wars. This movie is about the ideology. It shows that how ideology can sweep up people's mind to the extreme, but then it also shows that the ideology can never win. I give 9/10 because the scene with Jojo confronting Hitler at the end could have done better. It's just that Jojo's action just doesn't incorporate with the whole movie well."

"Alexander_Blanchett","9","1","3","29 December 2019"," This movie got balls
","It was a very refreshing take on a nazi war film. Definitely risky and a lot so balls involved to make the satire work and not backfiring. Taika Waitti had those balls and went even further than you would actually have expected. Its the kind of film you can do now but couldn't haven been done even 5 years ago.
What I liked most of it that it works during both phases, the comedic ones but also the dramatic ones. There are many shifts of emotions involved and it never feels over the place but exactly giving the audience a mixture of different moods. Acting is great. Roman Griffin Davis is absolutely THE discovery of the year. What an awesome performance for a young first timer. Very intense, funny and absolutely on the note. Excellent job and I am really looking forward to his next films. Thomasin McKenzie was also very good and proved herself as the perfect choice for the role. Sam Rockwell was perfectly cast and played that role with a lot of self irony but also heart. Rebel Wilson was really on fire here and also well chosen for the role she played. Of course there was Archie Yates who just like Davis is a great discovery and played wonderfully. Scarlett Johansson had many strong moments and is absolutely deserving every kind of love she is getting this year. She could have played that mother role pretty standard but she realy added a lot to it. Last but certainly not least there was Taika Waitti himself in the role of Hitler - well imaginary Hitler. Also such a on-the point performance with so much right irony.
A film that worked but could have easily failed. Its one of the most heart warming, funny but also sad films of the year."
"darkreignn","9","1","3","27 December 2019"," Beautiful and heartbreaking
","""Jojo Rabbit"" is a movie I wasn't particularly excited to see, but one I went to see because my cousin, a strapping young gentleman, wanted to see. And for the first half, I could tell he was enjoying it. He was laughing hard at the slapstick comedy, the silly antics of one of the silliest men alive, Adolf Hitler, and at the clever little lines that the film liked to throw at its audience. I, however, wasn't enjoying what I was seeing. I liked the concept, but the humor just wasn't clicking with me. And then, something changed.<br/><br/>""Jojo Rabbit"" is one of my favorite films of 2019, without a doubt. At around the halfway mark, it became, for me, one of the most beautiful and hopeful, but also tragic, films I've seen. A fantastical surrealistic masterpiece, ""Jojo Rabbit"" isn't meant to be taken too seriously. Perhaps that's because the film takes place from the eyes of a child, but regardless, it helps if you approach this movie as more of a fantasy than a drama.<br/><br/>I don't want to get into plot specifics or spoilers, and that's more out of laziness because I just drank a full glass of Woodford Reserve bourbon whiskey and I'd like to play some Death Stranding before going to bed, alone. Regardless, however, I would like to talk specifically about what made this movie resonate with me personally, and why I believe it is one of the best films of the year: ""Jojo Rabbit"" deals with distressing topics, which is obvious given the subject matter and plot synopsis, but also with relateable topics from young love and romance to the notion that often in this life we are born one thing, and then die another based on the choices that we make along the way.<br/><br/>There are scenes of pure beauty that had me awestruck and feeling butterflies in my stomach. There are sequences of crippling sadness that had me gasp and hold back tears. And there are sections of the film that are so intense I was literally holding my breath, my heart racing. God, I just wish I as back in the theatre right now reliving this film. Certain scenes will be burnt into my memory for as long as I live because of how gorgeous, sensual, powerful, and inspiring they were. Other scenes will have my awake at night because of how suspenseful and scary they were to watch unfold. ""Jojo Rabbit"" has it all, and I cannot emphasize enough how much I loved this film.<br/><br/>Now no movie is perfect, and with great power comes great responsibility; this movie is no exception. There were times where I felt like the lighthearted tone was unnecessary and even inappropriate, especially during the last half of the film when certain things were going down. I didn't mind the tone in the beginning, but towards the end when things are getting very serious and intense, I thought the jokiness of certain scenes could have been left out to make the goings on more impactful. However, once I took the film as the fantasy it is meant to be, this didn't bother me too much.<br/><br/>Part coming of age and loss of innocence, part fantasy, and part romance, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is an absolutely beautiful film, and one I'm so happy I went to see. Please, my words do not, and can not, do this movie justice. Go see it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"MrDHWong","9","1","3","26 December 2019"," Successfully blends quirky humour and heavy hitting drama without ever losing sight of its own unique identity
","Jojo Rabbit is a comedy drama war film written and directed by Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Based on the novel ""Caging Skies"" by Christine Leunens, it successfully blends quirky humour and heavy hitting drama without ever losing sight of its own unique identity.<br/><br/>During the last years of World War II, the timid ten-year-old Johannes Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) joins the Hitler Youth as he longs to defend his Nazi German homeland from the allied powers. Supporting him along the way is his imaginary friend - an eccentric childlike version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). After refusing to kill a rabbit during a training exercise, Johannes is given the derogatory nickname ""Jojo Rabbit"" by the other youth members. One day, Jojo discovers to his shock that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding a young Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in the wall of their house. Knowing full well that they will all be executed if the Nazis find out, Jojo decides to strike a deal with Elsa in that he will protect her in exchange for her sharing ""Jew secrets"" with him.<br/><br/>As is the case with all of Taika Waititi's films, Jojo Rabbit is filled with his signature tongue-in-cheek comedy that even the most casual of audiences can enjoy. Most of the laughs come from scenes where Jojo's interacts with the imaginary Hitler, which is what someone of his age would perceive Hitler to be like. However, whenever the film needs to touch on serious topics, such as the Jewish plight under Nazi rule, the film never trivialises such a thing and handles it in a respectful manner. This is a difficult film to get the tone just right for, but thanks to the careful efforts of Waititi, he manages to strike that perfect balance between funny and sombre.<br/><br/>In terms of production values, this may be Waititi's best work to date. His use of muted background colours is particularly noteworthy, as it helps make his lead cast members stand out in several scenes, especially during parts where they need to be seen separately from other Nazi characters. The use of cinematography is great as well, as we are shown the widespread Nazi presence in Jojo's small village, whether it's the tanks all lined up against buildings or the ""unpatriotic deserters"" being hanged in the streets. This again reminds us that even though the film is technically a comedy, it still uses Nazi Germany as a backdrop, who were responsible for many horrific acts.<br/><br/>All of the cast members did a superb job in their roles. Young newcomer Roman Griffin Davis carries the film in such a natural fashion that it is hard to believe that this is his very first role in a motion picture. He and Thomasin McKenzie, the latter of whom rose to prominence with her memorable performance in the 2018 film ""Leave No Trace"", had such wonderful on-screen chemistry and I loved watching the two of them interact with one another in spite of their character's polar opposites. Scarlett Johansson is also worth noting as Jojo's mother Rosie. Even though her screen time is limited, she leaves an impression thanks to her ability to chew the scenery as much as possible.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while the film's use of Nazi Germany as a backdrop for a comedy may seem off-putting to some mainstream viewers, any fan of Taika Waititi's work should enjoy it immensely. It truly shows how far he has come since his humble beginnings back in New Zealand and certainly has me on board for any future projects he has lined up for us.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"
"eevaivilo","8","1","3","20 December 2019"," BOLD
","I can't even imagine how difficult it was for Taika Waititi to get a film about a Hitler youth whos imaginary friend is Hitler greenlit. Kudos to him on that alone.
The amount of vision you have to have to make this film work is remarkable. It somehow manages to be both effectively hilarious and a grim depiction of Nazi Germany (how is that even a sentence I just wrote?).
My only criticism is that I wish we got to see more from Rosie before she was gone. Her loss was still effective as it was in the movie (the shot of her feet hanging stunned me), but it could have been even more affecting if we had gotten just a few more moments with her. Her last appearance was really just her walking away from Jojo, and then she was gone. If the film was an ode to single parents like Waititi says it is, that wasn't communicated that well, unfortunately
But it worked very well as both a coming of age story and a war drama, and the balance between humor and humanity was somehow perfect.
Lastly, I hope we see more of Roman Griffin Davis in the future. What an incredible young talent he is."
"thomastobutt","9","1","3","14 December 2019"," REFRESHING FILM!
","This comedy/drama of World War II is very refreshing with a great film debut from young Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, a young boy striving to be a Nazi.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi, who both directs and plays a imaginary friend to Jojo version of Hitler, adds an distinct and independent feel to all the films he's involved in (eg. Thor: Ragnarok).<br/><br/>Not only does this film have compelling characters, but it also has a large amount of comedy which is all very enjoyable and not lame. I haven't felt like this about many films but Jojo Rabbit compelled me for the whole duration of the film witnessing its funny humour and very deep moments with his mother. A very beautiful and refreshing film!"
"cricketbat","8","1","3","11 December 2019"," The delightfully dark comedy is verboten, but refreshing
","Watching Jojo Rabbit is a peculiar experience. At times, this film is delightfully irreverent. Then suddenly the story becomes emotionally poignant.

Plus, Roman Griffin Davis gives an impressively nuanced performance as the titular character. I don't know how or why this movie works, but it truly does."

","Taika Waititi is best known for Thor Ragnarok but hell be loved forever for Jojo Rabbit. Watching Jojo's trailer and knowing Taika's past movies, you know this movie is gonna be extremely funny and have a heart. However Jojo will surprise audiences on how invested they will become for these characters and see that people are deeper than they think they are. By the end of the film, all the characters will teach the audience that we can be more than what is expected of us and that life is more beautiful when we enjoy the moments and care for each other. This film sends the message to love life, family, friends, and dance whenever you can."

A lot of non-important moments, but I get it's to get to your emotions, (mom dancing with son, screaming at him pretending to be dad, mom talking to the girl, talking at the bridge). Kind of pointless. I didn't feel much feeling in those scenes.

","It's very unusual movie. Often films about WWII can be divide in two groups: 1) serious, big films with moral, tradegy and drama; 2) comedies with a little bit stupid humour and a lot of gags. This film isn't in that groups. Firstly, the plot is genius, WWII shown by eyes of 10-years boy, who believes in Hitler like in God. He must choose: his belief or his friendship and love, and this cathes you all. Also drama and comedy alternate each other, it creates movement of plot. Secondly, the cast is great, I can say it about both generation of actors and actresses. Young cast did all performance well, especially the main character. Adult cast is brilliant of film. Sam Rockwell is the king of supporting role, and with Rebel Wilson they became stars of film. Scarlett Johansson is one of the best actress of our days, she played one the difficult role in this film - mother of Jojo. Of course, I must say about Hitler of Taika Waititi, you should watch it, it's very funny.

","I was really looking forward to this movie but was a tad disappointed when I finally got to see it. I think comedy drama is a difficult genre anyway and this movie uneasily traversed the two. I think it should have been a straight out satirical comedy. The pathos when it came, just didn't sit well with the surreal lunacy of the plot. The child actors are wonderful and all of them give honest and believable performances which is an accolade given the script and what they were expected to do. The adult actors not so much. Scarlett Johansson was particularly annoying as Jojo's resistance agent mother. She didn't feel real as a character. Neither did most of the adults in this movie. I know it's a satire but some of the performances were just too cartoon like to evoke any real emotion. I did find Rebel Wilson's performance amusing but that was about it. All in all, a strange concoction which was neither witty or satirical enough to really lampoon the Third Reich and neither dramatic or heartfelt enough to portray a Germany coming to the end of its quest for World domination. I so much wanted to like this but I found it underwhelming and if I want to watch Nazis being made fun of, I prefer ""Allo Allo"" (British sitcom set in occupied France)!"

The film tells a story from a completely unexpected perspective, one that you might have wondered but never saw in reality and that is what it makes it so brilliant... The main idea is to show how a person might slowly realise that the ideology one was taught might not be true and how a world of that person might fall apart bit by bit to realise the truth. The acting is superb, the kids both deserve an Oscar, so does Scarlet Johanson, because it might be her best dramatic role... The film comes at a right time, when the far right ideologies started to dominate the world and things like Brexit start to happen and fuel hatred for each other... Ironically but the film itself also has a certain ideology, the women characters are portrayed with stronger personalities maybe except Captain Klenzendorf which although is portrayed as a secret gay but turns out to be a hero... There was also one overweight brainwashed Nazi lady whose purpose was to show what having 14 children can do to your body...<br/><br/>So although I enjoyed the film a great deal it has a certain feminism ideology to it, but maybe with just the right balance..."

Surrounded by well known, seasoned actors (Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson), the two children - Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie - stand out. And Waititi in the role of the imaginary Hitler is hilarious. Be prepared to laugh out loud in one scene yet cry your heart out in the next.

There went a lot of bravery into showcasing this tragic part of the World War, mixing some humour in it, while still making it feel so real. Movie of the year for me for sure!"

","Having finally managed to find the time I decided to watch Jojo Rabbit, I had managed to avoid any trailers or spoilers. All I knew is who directed and the rough outline it was about the Nazis, Hitler in particular and was a surreal comedy.
What stood out about this prior to seeing it was a general mood that this was too difficult a movie to describe. However having watched it and in the main enjoyed it, its simply an updated Anne Frank style story with some humour thrown in.
Unfortunately it is not in the same league as Wilderpeople. Its good thats all not great. The humour mostly lands and in the main how you feel about the silly version of Hitler is likely how you will feel about this overall. A glaring mistake for me however was during the movie Hitler used a phrase which made reference to something which was actually contemporary which had a jarring effect as it spoiled the illusion of this being set during the war.
Despite it mainly being a comedy with most of the gags at the expense of the Nazis the final act does turn darker which may explain why so many didnt like this movie.I can understand why as it feels like two separate movies split by the final act.
Worth going to see but its not groundbreaking and the way its being sold to the public doesnt really fit with how it actually is. Its basically a rehash of Anne Frank with a few more gags."

"JBLOSS","6","1","4","14 January 2020"," Satirical yet disingenuous
","There are plenty of things to like about Jojo Rabbit, the performances from the actors are all strong and there are some nice moments of comedy and poignancy. However, my big issue with the film was its portrayal of a Germany that in 1945 was on its knees, had been bombed to destruction and yet the street that the lovely Jojo lives on appears untouched. Even when we see the final battle (why oh why was there a need to show both Russian and American soldiers?) and the ruins, Jojo's street remains unblemished. The hidden Jewish girl, Elsa, would have been hiding for many years, unable to go out yet appears almost glowing. Jojo's mother, Scarlet Johansson, dresses well, has lots of make-up. To me this dilutes the power of the film, the fantasy world of Jojo would have been so much more powerful set against a realistic backdrop.
Jojo's interaction with ""Hitler"" is also problematic - he's either the product of Jojo's imagination or he isn't, but the way he behaves in some instances feels like he has a life of his own.
This could have been a classic with all the ingredients it has but ended up being a slightly above average comedy."
"The-Sarkologist","10","1","4","10 January 2020"," Delightfully Confronting
","I'm am so glad that I made the effort to actually get out and see this film because, well, it was mindblowing in so many ways, and pretty funny as well. In fact, it is one of those films that should be a definite watch for many people, particularly in light of the fact that it is about a young German boy living at the close of World War II. The thing is that this boy is 10, so he has not know of a world in which Hitler was not the ruler of Germany, and of course he has basically become brainwashed with all of the propaganda that is being churned out.<br/><br/>Yet his views are about to become challenged, especially when he discovers a young girl hiding in his attic - a Jewish girl - and this is how the film plays out. He doesn't know who knows about the girl, and the girl isn't letting him know about anything either. So, it seems, in many cases, that he has been snookered - and his beliefs about the Jews are also being challenged, particularly once he is confronted by one.<br/><br/>In a way what we are seeing is not just the undoing of Germany, but the undoing of this little boy's world. His father is missing, and his mother is everything, but it turns out that there is so much that he doesn't know, or understand. One interesting line is that he claims to be a Nazi, and this is rebuked because he isn't a Nazi, he just loves Swastikas.<br/><br/>Yet it also confronts us with the reality of racism, of how we will demonise a certain group simply because they are different. The sad reality is that this seems to be happening all over again, yet there is a vast difference between the racism we see now, and the racism back then. They reality is that while we were horrified at what happened during World War II, this type of stuff was going on anyway in many of the allied countries.<br/><br/>However, what is even more worrying is that the dogwhisting tactics that Hitler used to such great success are being used now, today, to turn us against our fellow humans. In reality the Jews weren't all that much different from us, and you couldn't actually tell the difference between a Jew and a non-Jew, though the dog whistling, and racial stereotypes are being painted of people that do look different. In particular, there is this whole 'failure to integrate' argument that is used to destroy a unique, and different, culture.<br/><br/>Yes, this is definitely a timely movie, and a movie for the world that we live in now. It is just sad that those this film should be challenging aren't the people that will be seeing this film."

","If you're going to do a comedy with Hitler and Nazis in it, at least make it funny - like Mel Brooks' The Producers.<br/><br/>There's enough of a potentially good farce here with Jojo as the Nazi Youth who's mother, Scarlett Johansson, who is sheltering a Jewish friend (Thomasin McKenzie) of her deceased daughter. Jojo goes about his daily routine of dressing up in uniform and keeping a diary of hateful propaganda he's digested, going to Nazi boy camp with his best mate - Archie Yates, who is far funnier - to be schooled by Sam Rockwell, as a reckless master who's all but lost the will to live, and Rebel Wilson, as an instructor all too willing to die for what she believes in.<br/><br/>These are all fine, but it's Taika Waititi's Hitler who stands out as an annoying and redundant pest: he steals the scenes he's in by being boring and juvenile, slowing the pace down so he can gurn his way through whatever attention he can grab. Why is he in it at all if he does nothing to advance the story? It all seems a bit too much of an over-extended and unnecessary cameo by a director who's lost the run of himself after some delightfully human stories and finely weighted cameos.<br/><br/>It's shot in that sub-Wes Anderson way, bright pastels and saturated primaries, but with none of the compositional precision, intricate dialogue and editing, nor any second viewing wit.<br/><br/>Obviously, from the trailer, no one is expecting to watch a childhood war film along the lines of 'Come and See', but this isn't anywhere near as funny or controversial as it would like to think it is and for the most part simply fails to deliver on its potential to be either.<br/><br/>A pity."
"michaelely-01627","10","1","4","3 January 2020"," If you didn't like it, you didn't get it.
","JoJo Rabbit beautifully illustrates how villianous propoganda can affect the youth and inspire heartbreaking cultural misinformation. When we meet JoJo, his ignorance is painted comical, but underlying the comedy is the sting of realism. In Nazi Germany, anti-Semitic propoganda completely altered the truth, and was most effective on impressionable German children, like JoJo. It is Truth that begins to transform him and his unacceptance of this world he has been taught to glorify is what drives the film. Satire is the vehicle, but Truth and Morality is the passenger. If you hated JoJo Rabbit because you thought it made fun of the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany during WW2, then you have missed the point."

He brings that expertise to JoJo Rabbit to make the most uplifting, optimistic, hilarious Nazi movie that's ever made me cry.

"kjproulx","9","1","4","21 November 2019"," A Wonderful Satire
","It goes without saying that today's generation doesn't take to offensive humour as much as they used to, or at least be as forgiving as they used to. For that reason alone I was surprised to see a movie like Jojo Rabbit even get made. After watching it, it also seems like a very necessary and welcome release for today's day. I'm so happy a film like this was made because the rich environment and characters Taika Waititi creates here are worth the price of admission alone. Although this humour absolutely won't be for everyone and may even be a little too off-beat for some, here's why I believe Jojo Rabbit is a fantastic satire, even if some may not enjoy it.<br/><br/>In Nazi Germany, a young boy in Jojo Roman Griffin Davis) is oblivious to the horrors that Hitler represents, so he creates him as an imaginary friend to help him through his struggles. As the plot kicks into gear, he discovers that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding Elsa, a Jewish girl, in the walls of their house. This is a film that seems funny on its surface and does have quite a few great laughs, but the surrounding atmosphere and overall story are meant to be taken very seriously. This worked very well for me and I think the end result made for a fun, moving piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi is definitely not new to the director's chair, but I always find myself impressed with his work. Whether it be in creating the fantastic Hunt for the Wilderpeople or the highly entertaining Thor: Ragnarok, his style is very unique. With that said, I think Jojo Rabbit is his best work to date. This is the most I've ever seen him juggle comedy and drama so well together and they never seemed to clash. I will always look forward to his upcoming projects because, at the very least, they will have some kind of entertaining aspect.<br/><br/>From Roman Griffin Davis in the title role to Sam Rockwell as Captain Klenzendorf, Scarlett Johansson as the mysterious Rosie to the absolutely hysterical Archie Yates as Jojo's best friend Yorki, this film is littered with talent. On top of that talent, these characters were written by Waititi with care, adapted from the novel by Christine Leunens. There was never a moment where I questioned if a certain performer should have been cast in any of these roles because although there is some great emotion, it's all played up as fun. I really enjoyed the ride this movie took me on.<br/><br/>Overall, Jojo Rabbit suffers from the fact that the humour is quite dry and won't be for everyone, but if ultimately one of the better films I've seen all year. Filled with laughter, heart, a meaningful story with a terrific message and gut punches that you wouldn't expect, I think Jojo Rabbit is deserving of its praises. At a mere 100 minutes, this movie flies by, delivering a really enjoyable viewing experience. As long as you know what you're in for, I highly recommend this one."
"jashminocha","8","1","4","21 November 2019"," Fantastic and urgent need for such film making
","Taika Waititi's latest creation delivers what i consider is a masterpiece. Incredible, fantastic and moving performances delivered by phenomenal actors on screen which will stay with u for a long time. The movie by no means try to preach or deliver a message. What it is trying is to bring about is foolishness of Nazism or Hitler. The movie in no way is trying to ridicule the atrocities of the second world war but it tries to ridicule the concept of hate or Nazism by the means of satire. Taika uses satire to tackle or visualizes the atrocities committed by Nazi. The best way to deal with grief is Satire...."
"hunter-friesen","7","1","4","16 November 2019"," ""Jojo Rabbit"" comically attacks Nazis
","If you're going to make a movie about the Nazis, you better make sure it's going to be good. Multiply that rule by infinity if you're going to make it a comedy.<br/><br/>Because of this strict rule, only a select few have been able to take the greatest human atrocity of the modern era and turn it into a joke. Charlie Chaplin did it in 1940 with ""The Great Dictator"" (although he wasn't fully aware of the horrors), followed by Roberto Benigni with ""Life is Beautiful"" in 1998. Now in 2019, Taika Waititi has added his name to that illustrious list with his newest film, ""Jojo Rabbit"".<br/><br/>Set in the waning months of World War II, this ""anti-hate satire"" follows the life of Jojo Betzler, a young boy growing up in the Hitler Youth. His patriotism runs so high Adolf Hitler himself acts as his imaginary friend. One day, Jojo discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl named Elsa in their walls. This bewilders the boy, putting him in a quandary over what to do with his foreign guest. With an enemy in his home, Jojo must confront his nationalistic ideals and learn for himself what truly lies within the people he was born to hate.<br/><br/>Apart from a few problems structurally and tonally, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is near faultlessly helmed by New Zealand native and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" director, Taika Waititi.<br/><br/>From the often symmetric shot composition to the sumptuous production design, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is the most Wes Anderson-esque film that Wes Anderson didn't direct. It does feel like Waititi is copying a little too hard from time to time, but the distinct whimsical style he employs effortlessly immerses the audience into the satirical world.<br/><br/>Aiding this immersion, Waititi does what he knows best and interweaves comedy with drama as he pokes fun at the Nazis while also using them as a smaller target for his much grander message. That message is of peace and love, which can be authentically found within this story, especially in the interactions between Jojo and Elsa.<br/><br/>A negative side effect of Waititi's fluent directing is that it makes his middling writing stick it like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>His risque plot eventually gets boiled down to a slightly over-simplistic message that isn't able to land its punches as hard as it should. Weirdly, it all feels a little too safe for this kind of setting with these types of characters.<br/><br/>The film also starts to lose its way around the middle third as a few of its many ideas and characters get lost in the shuffle. A few reveals are shocking, but only because not enough time was put into them to make us believe they were important enough in the first place.<br/><br/>Even with these problems looming throughout the runtime, the script does have its shining individual moments. The slapstick one-liners mostly all land and the heart-tugging dramatic lines do hit close to home.<br/><br/>With an assembled all-star cast, ""Jojo Rabbit"" is filled with great performances from A-list stars and fresh discoveries.<br/><br/>The biggest hidden treasure that has been unearthed is the talent of Roman Griffin Davis. In his first-ever role, Davis perfectly translates his precocious character from the page to the screen. The future will be deservedly bright for him.<br/><br/>Young star Thomasin McKenzie also does excellent work as Elsa. She already made a name for herself with last year's ""Leave No Trace"" and her role here further solidifies her strong track record.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson plays Rosie, Jojo's sympathetic mother who takes in Elsa for hiding. Away from her usual Marvel role, this may be Johansson's best work in years as she is both hilarious and endearing.<br/><br/>In more purely comedic roles, Taikia Waittiti and Sam Rockwell are a blast as Adolf Hitler and Captain Kenzendorf, respectively.<br/><br/>Taking the horrors of humanity and turning it into a comedic moral lesson is no small feat, especially when you target the worst of the worst. So even with his struggles here and there, immense credit should go to Waititi as he has crafted one of the better films of the year and made something that will be timeless in its message and morals."

","I have been a fan of Waititi's films since watching Boy several years ago. His follow-up films have been great! But this one seems to have fallen short for me.
I thought visually, the film looks great. I thought he did a great job of capturing the look of the time.
But the characters, which have been his strongest point in past films, are very flat in this one. I never got the sense I knew any of them. Even the Hitler character, I understand he is the boy's conscience, but it just never really resonated with me. Why does Hitler appear when he does, why was he gone for so long?
There were also problems with Jojo's mother played by Scarlett Johansson, and Sam Rockwell's character. Why did the act the way they did, and what made them be against the regime? This inability to get in touch with the two characters made their death moments feel out of place, and disconnected.
And lastly, the biggest problem: Jojo. Why was he such a hard core, pro-Hitler, pro-Nazi person, but his family seemed to be more moderate Germans. Was it because he didn't have too many friends? Why did he not get along with other kids?
So many questions just came up, but it felt like the viewer was just supposed to take everything at face value, so any turns in character just felt contrived and hollow.
And for a coming of age film, I didn't really get that sense with Jojo. I mean, he does appear to change his views, but it doesn't feel like a natural progression, and that goes back to him just not being a well-developed character.
I'm hoping on repeat viewing I might enjoy this film a bit more, but overall, I think Taika Waititi's best work up to this point is behind him. I sure hope his next movie is more enjoyable!"

Taika Waititi should get the Oscar for Best writing adapted screenplay and Best director, not to mention that the movie deserves the Oscar for best movie, of course.
Roman Griffin Davis, totally deserves the Oscar for Best actor. His acting is of the scale! Something that you don't see often at this young age.
I don't know if Scarlett Johansson deserves the Oscar for Best supporting actress, however her performance was up there and I believe that if she had a longer role, she would totally deserve it. I am waiting for the special edition Bluray with the extended scenes, to see more of her.
Archie Yates was fantastic and he and Sam Rockwell got the best lines in movie. If his role was longer he would probably be nominated for Best supporting actor too. However, this is what happens when you compress the movie for the theater. I am waiting for the special edition Bluray with the extended scenes, to see more of him.
Bottom line: The movie is exceptional. Does it deserve to be watched? OMG: Absolutely! I have seen it over 10 times so far and I can't stop watching it. It is a shiny ray of hope in the dystopian world we still live in. Don't miss it! :)"

(It's akin to discussing a fair & balanced NBA without bringing up the ""B-Word,"" or praising Hollywood's meritocracy with no allusions to the thousands of ""W-Word"" household names.) Just as one can see the good on each side by remembering that ""Milky Way"" refers to BOTH stars and candy bars, JOJO RABBIT and THE PRODUCERS (musical version) are two peas in a pod, featuring a hilarious H-Word. (To reduce this continuing awkwardness, from here on I'll substitute ""Hipster"" for the H-Word.) I still think that THE PRODUCERS' Fuhrer if far funnier than JOJO RABBIT's. There is no gut-busting moment in the latter flick to compare with the earlier film's ""Springtime for Hipster (and Germany)"" dance routine. JOJO RABBIT's bunny trail slopes steadily downhill, winding up as much of a morbid downer as LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. The glaring casting mistake which finds Confederate Wilson playing a Flatulent Fraulein here is akin to such an egregious error as installing Divine as the title character of THE GODFATHER would have been.

","I saw ""Jojo Rabbit"", starring Roman Griffin Davis-in his first movie; Scarlett Johansson-the Avengers movies, Eight Legged Freaks; Sam Rockwell-Vice, Cowboys & Aliens and Taika Waititi-What We Do in the Shadows, Green Lantern.
This is a quirky dark comedy about WW2. Roman plays a 10 year old boy in Nazi Germany during WW2 that is in a Hitler youth camp-they train children to become Nazi soldiers. Sam plays one of the teachers that instills hatred of the Jewish persuasion into their young naive minds. Things such as that Jews have magic powers, can control minds, hang from the ceiling like bats to sleep, etc. Scarlett plays Roman's mother, who does not share those beliefs. In fact, Scarlett gives refuge to a Jewish girl by hiding her in the attic but she doesn't tell Roman because of his schooling, so when he finds her hiding place, there is a dilemma. Should he turn her in, like a good Nazi? Or if he does, will his mother get in trouble for hiding her? Taika plays Roman's imaginary friend that Roman talks to for advice-no one else can see Hitler. FYI: Taika also wrote and directed the movie.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for disturbing images, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you like quirky, then it would be a good rental."

"DeBBss","9","0","3","7 May 2020"," What Comedy Should Be at Heart
","Jojo Rabbit is a comedy that focuses on some serious topics, those topics being World War 2 and Adolf Hitler. Having a comedy that is based on Nazis and their point of views may be controversial, but I think that it's important to try to bring out laughter or happiness to such a serious topic. My beliefs are that you can make comedy out of anything, no matter how serious or controversial it is. Jojo Rabbit masters the comedy, as I think that silly comedy is the right way to go for something like this. Silly comedy can come off stupid and/or childish, but Jojo rabbit's comedy can make anyone laugh (only if the viewer have a sense of humor).<br/><br/>The plot itself is rather original in my opinion; a young manipulated Nazi boy who meets a Jewish girl hiding in his house who then form a unique relationship. The plot can be done as a drama, but I think it's best done as a comedy, as there's so much more opportunities you can do. Although this movie is really goofy, it has extremely mature themes, like brainwashing, death of a loved one, and hate. The scene of Jojo realizing that is mother is dead is extremely sad, and this theme is super important as it's a wake up call that this is Nazi Germany after all. Jojo rabbit also focuses on some very important parts in World War 2 history that not a lot of movies touch on. For example, the manipulation of young children in Nazi Germany and propaganda. So although Saving Private Ryan is a history lesson, Jojo Rabbit equally brings something new to the table.<br/><br/>Adolf Hitler in this movie is extremely well done because this isn't actually Adolf Hitler, but it's Adolf Hitler portrayed in the mind of a kid. So even though Adolf Hitler probably isn't a funny guy in real life, this version is hilarious. Rebel Wilson, Taika Waititi, and Sam Rockwell are the main source of comedy in this movie, and the delivery of the lines were done so well, and I think that there should be more appreciation to the actors. Roman Griffin Davis did a great job too; when children cry in movies, it feels fake and forced, but Roman Griffin Davis completely sold it. The characters and comedy were written so well in Jojo Rabbit that Taika Waititi is already in the Hall of Fame for comedy in my eyes. He played as Korg in Thor: Ragnarok and Adolf Hitler in Jojo Rabbit, so he definitely has plenty of potential.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is a must watch if you enjoy comedy at the slightest bit. Jojo Rabbit is what comedy should be; it should make you laugh and it should make you cry while telling an amazing story. At first I thought Jojo Rabbit was going to be stupid by the looks of it, but I'm so glad I've seen it, as it truly made my day."
"fozaibalisamraa","10","0","3","7 May 2020"," A movie that takes you to another world!
","German nationalism, sense of racial-superiority, and profound hatred for jews, are the main themes around which the plot of the entire movie revolves. Jojo, a kid of some 7-8 years of age, is seen to be brought up in the German society where all of the above-stated characteristics are deeply inculcated into his mind and personality. He has been taught by the society that it is Adolf Hitler, who is the true saviour, flag-raiser and hero of the Germans. The kid was made to believe that, with Hitler by their side, they could triumph over even the strongest of the enemies. Jojo, being so much enchanted by the fuhrer's majesty and charismatic persona, had made the fuhrer his imaginary pal, who talks to jojo, discusses war with him, infuses in him the love for Germans and Hitler, while at the same time the hatred for the Jews.<br/><br/>Jojo's mother, scarlett Johansson, proved her praiseworthy acting-skills yet again. She has perfectly played the role of a genius mother who brings up her kid in a reasonable manner even in the absence of his father. She outwardly pretends to be an ardent proponent of Germany's machinations but, in reality she provides safe haven to a Jewish girl in her very home. She has been portrayed so much kind and humane that she doesn't hesitate to compromise even her own share of food, and gives it to the hapless Jewish girl. She refuses to turn a blind eye to her humanistic responsibilities even if it requires the sacrifice of her own life."

","This was a film that i wasn't sure whether i wanted to watch when it was released on 1st January 2020, so i left it, until this week where all of a sudden i had an urge to see Taika Waititi's work.
So lets set the scene. This satire film is depicting the demised of the German fight in World War II in 1944. Now let me emphasise the word SATIRE. We are introduced to a boy, Johannes Betzler (Jojo for short) who is a 10 year old boy from a good German family. Jojo (played by Roman Griffin Davis) Idolises Adolf Hitler (who you see during the movie, played by Waititi himself). I believe that this was possibly common practice of a typical young German boy in those times. Whether that be through peer pressure or just the way they saw life. Jojo,s father we learn is absent and, ""in Italy"". So in effect Jojo is the man of the house and sees it his duty to be the man of the house, support him mom, Rosie (played by Scarlett Johansson) and support his ""hero"" and Fuhrer.
We see Jojo readying himself to go to a big weekend of ""fun"" at the Nazi Party Youth Organisation, this is similar to going off with the Scouts, or Girl Guides but with the madness of a satire look at how the Germans/Hitler would have ordered. By this i mean that the boys learn hand grenade throwing, camouflage and a whole host of other things while the girls will learn ""Womanly duties, like dressing wounds, making beds and learning how to make babies"". See comedy at its best! Once this is said by Captain K (played by Sam Rockwell) cut to Fraulein Rahn (played by Rebel Wilson), who for me delivers a laugh out load moment, she says ""I've had 18 kids for Germany, Its such a great year to be a girl"". (believe me her deliverance of this line is far better that i can just write down the words. Jojo's world gets turned upside down when he discovers that his mom has a Jew girl, Elsa (played by Thomasin McKenzie) hiding in their house. This is where the real story begins
I liked this movie and i thought that there were some good acting performances from Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie. I think they could have a really bright movie career ahead of them.
I have to mention one more thing before i go, as you know i do not give spoilers, please please look out for when Captain K has ordered defenses and has asked for the German Shepherds"
"richarddillomes","9","0","3","1 May 2020"," If it will take two kids to show us Kindness, then so be it
","Jojo Rabbit is about a German boy named Jojo who at an early age already has blind fanaticism towards Adolf Hitler. He joins the youth branch of Hitler's army but succumbs to an injury that basically renders him unfit in their eyes. He later finds out that a Jewish girl named Elsa lives secretly in their house and tries to make her talk about her kind so he can write a book exposing them which will gain him favor once again from the youth army so he can stop being relegated to meager so he can be at the forefront of the war along with his second-best friend Yorki (because Hitler deserves the top spot.) In the process he falls in love with Elsa and becomes torn between blindly serving his country and his own realization that someone isn't necessarily evil because you were led to believe that they were. We know how World War II ended but how will it be for Elsa who wants freedom and Jojo who doesn't want to lose her?<br/><br/>While watching, I had my reservations whether this should've been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars this year. I have to admit that I initially rated it as an okay film midway through. But when that pivotal scene when Jojo was looking at Johannson's shoes, it sent shivers to my spine. It's non-stop rollercoaster from then on and for me it sealed its well-deserved nomination. Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok) helmed the screenplay as well as direction and acted as Hitler. I love his decision to show how colorful Germany was in the WWII (which is backed up by research) as opposed to what we're used to, seeing it dreary in gray and black. Scarlett Johannson as Jojo's mother was likable but I failed to see the nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Sam Rockwell channeling Bill Murray was inspired, Rebel Wilson had the most memorable line, and Alfie Allen I felt was underused but I don't blame him if he wanted to be in on this. Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa was a picture of strength and elegance. But the movie really belonged to its child actors, Archie Yates as Yorki and Roman Griffin Davies as Jojo. Initially I did not like Davies but warmed up to him by the end and I realized it's because he convincingly played a loyal Hitler fan in the beginning that had a change of heart. Yates and Davies have good comic timing considering this is the first acting gig for both.<br/><br/>Waititi said one of the reasons he made this is because of the behavior of some who's forgotten how evil and ugly WWII was and he wanted this to serve as one of the reminders. It's true that historical revision is on the rise, Nazis being adored, Marcoses are back in power despite multiple references available to how they plundered the Philippines during Martial Law and many others. The saying we are bound to repeat history if we don't learn from it holds so much weight right now. While it is almost next to impossible to talk about opposing views without hurting each other's feelings, Jojo Rabbit reminds us to ask ourselves one question each time you're engaged in a debate: WERE YOU KIND? Because at the end of the day you may be wrong about your philosophy which others will forget eventually, but how you treated them will leave an impression that will last a lifetime. Hitler in the movie said it is up to you if you want to be remembered. He failed to say it's also important HOW and WHAT you will be remembered for."

","First off, when you think about the thematic concept of this film, you wonder about the very specific tone it requires for the comedy to work, without affecting and unbalancing the drama, since even nowadays can still be quite a touchy subject matter. Yet, Taika Watiti's magnificent and well-deserved Oscar winning screenplay adapted from a novel, goes to show what a great thing it is to still have creativity put into heartfelt cinema in a cultural world where remakes, reboots and reunions seem to be the general agenda to commercialize. Creativity even in a thematic field where many have come and gone on numerous ocassions, where is hard to tell stories that can genuinely make one laugh within the somber context of the situation, without taking any seriousness of it, and that's where the story is successful, where one can cherish the proper execution, where every single actor played their parts extremely well that helped the story flow so smoothly.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit has incredibly well-written characters which is where it resides its clue to function as a dark comedy, given its disconcerting times.
Jojo's interactions with his mother are quite clever, and can leave an impression on you; and scenes with Elsa have such a comedic weight that gives you such joy that you're instantly reminded that usually these kinds of stories don't end up too well.<br/><br/>I believe this film will be remembered for years to come and it will come to be even more appreciated than it is today.

","Pairing a preteen Nazi with imaginary best pal Adolf Hitler sounds like egregious cinematic overreach, but the wonderful ""Jojo Rabbit"" proves as improbably enthralling as moviemaking can get.<br/><br/>Set in the wind-down of World War II, we follow the youthful zealotry of Johannes ""Jojo Rabbit"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), a lad infatuated with Nazi iconography. To bolster his machismo in the pursuit of influence, he feeds his head propaganda, and instructs it to supplant his departed father with das F√É¬ºhrer.<br/><br/>Sharing this plot line at the water cooler elicits very real bafflement. Yet Taika Waititi's film is as tender as it is tack-sharp. ""Jojo Rabbit"" takes fascism to the woodshed and holds a mirror to its inane pervasiveness. - (Was this review of use to you?

The director with its Maori ancestry as well some Jewish parts (reed his brief biography) allowed himself to make a parody about these terrible times. By making so called parody, comedy from atrocities, we give them legacy like it was something funny and not a catastrophic event..I stop here, there is no sense to continue....what I am worried is those who gave it a 9 and a 10 mark like they are out of space (alien) with zero knowledge about the past."

","The film is not a critical piece of serious literature directed against the evil, dark, or even radical actions of the nazis. It's anti-hate.

And when the last film, when we saw the leading role is so hidden in the darkness of the environment is still strong to grow up, and find the light, is a source of even better to resolve the dispute, will race, war, rebellion, hegemony and other sensitive topics are moderately bypass, only pay attention to jo-jo the child's mind world and his life.

","Taika Waiiti delivers a hilarious, tragic, and heartwarming film, depicted the idea of learning through kindness, struggle, and love. The film has surprisingly split critics, and some of them have considered it ""conversational"". However, the film despite depicting the experiences of a 10 year old in hitler's youth army during a horrible time, comes off still to be lighthearted. The film executes the idea of being brainwashed into hating very well, with great performances both comedic and dramatic, as well as a great script and beautiful cinematography, with costume and set designs achievements as well.

"FireHead322199","9","0","1","24 April 2020"," A child's perspective on World War II
","To start off, going into this movie I really did not expect it to be as good as it was. Based on the film's advertising and marketing one would think the film is a feel-good comedy movie. However, the film is less of a comedy film and more like a dark comedy dram or dramedy.
The film it self is about a German boy who is apart of the nazi party and his view on the war, current way of living, and view on the Jewish race. Keep in mind the film is being told from this child's perspective so if there is any thing that appears a bit too silly or out of place of the typical World War II movie this is why. There have been some reviewers that despise the movie for it not always being too serious but I believe this is the film's greatest strength.
In terms of the acting department this film would get a 10/10. The child actors Roman Griffin Davis in the lead role and actress Thomason McKenzie both give convincing and at times dramatic performances. The film also stars Scarlett Johansson( won best supporting actress) as Jojo's mother and praise goes to director Taika Waititi in portrayal of Adolf Hitler.
Lastly, the film in my opinion is good just for being so clever and original. The film somehow manages to be this thoughtful and sometimes shocking World War II film and balances it out with some comic relief. Luckily, the timing of the comic relief is just right not being to much or being too cheesy. Altogether, I highly recommend everyone go see Jojo rabbit with my score of 9/10."

"Semisonic","8","0","1","19 April 2020"," A healing experience
","Here in Russia, it's a common opinion that we have a twisted perception of German language because the first encounter with it usually happens when we watch a war movie, where hearing the German speech usually means that something really bad is about to happen. I'm not sure if I ever had nightmares about running away from ""Ze Germans"", but just the sound of Till Lindemann counting from one to ten does indeed sound like some unholy incantation.<br/><br/>My generation is maybe the last one still scarred with this cultural propaganda. There have been so many war films made in the USSR days, and those films still keep on coming. And the absolute most of them feed you two main things: fear and hate. I wish it was otherwise, I really do. But that's how it is, and it's part of the reason I never really liked war movies as a kid.<br/><br/>So I can honestly say one thing. Jojo Rabbit is the best war movie that I've never seen in my childhood. But I'm still grateful that it happened now. Despite being such a grotesquely simplified guilty pleasure, it has one thing any other serious films about this topic lack: sanity. That, and humanity. The 10 year old boy with scars on his face and a swastika on his armband somehow managed to keep his soul intact, and that child's purity is what allows you to see the horrors of war but avoid its traumas.<br/><br/>It might be Waititi's writing that won this film an Oscar. But the heart of it was carried by Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell. Ever since Lost in Translation it was clear that Johansson can act, but for me this film has revealed her ability to steal scenes and carry them single-handedly. That soot mustache speech and a dance that ensued, that's quite mature for someone generally associated with ""sexy"" characters. And Mr Rockwell, oh my, I didn't like him since The Green Mile, respected him since Moon and loved him since Seven Psychopaths, but here he's just a perfect cherry on top. The last battle attire, that smokey-eyed stare, he's a true hero for giving the Nazi image a face nobody has probably dared to put on before, at least not in such a dashing and self-accepting way.<br/><br/>The accolades could go on and on. To Waititi's ""your own, personal Adolf"", to Jojo himself, who managed to come from a clumsy kid to a swaggering hustler at the end, to the brave and gentle ghost in the walls. Waititi has a talent for using the little details that look simple but add that very taste that turns cloying into touching and dumb into funny. He's done it before, and he's clearly doing it this time as well.<br/><br/>Whatever silly nonsense this film has shown, it is not something to be bothered about I think. If a war movie has to be surrealistic to spread love instead of hate, let it be. There's nothing civil about war anyway, so better a funny Hitler than the real one."

","In the film, Joe Joe's seemingly innocent ideas, the fantasy of Hitler as a friend, the attitude that the world is so beautiful, and the Hitler Youth League, which is like a summer children's summer camp, make me wonder ridiculously that the story of the movie ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" was set in Germany in 1945, or in the United States in 2019, and it was Joe Joe's love and addiction to Nazism. It is like a protective bubble around the body, although it can temporarily isolate the outside world, but when it is broken, it also highlights the ruthlessness and cruelty of the real society.<br/><br/>""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" because Joe Joe can not distinguish between good and evil young age, through him to take everything seriously, but in the eyes of the audience is like a playful way, showing the Nazis brainwashing people, idolatry at that time, let everyone blindly follow the phenomenon. Like Joe Joe, who could not hurt a rabbit at a training camp, but was able to point a knife at a Jewish girl who was indoctrinated by the Nazis as a reader, magic and unkind, didn't it show that many German soldiers might have been like Joe at the time, not that their nature was so bad, but that they were otherwise manipulated by the people in power?<br/><br/>The illusory and reality of ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe""<br/><br/>Baijia / Yizhi<br/><br/>Therefore, while we are still enjoying Joe Joe's lovely fantasies and many absurd jokes in the film, ""the fantasy world of the young Joe Joe"" suddenly uncovers the reality of the war hidden behind the farce, just as a huge change without the original greenhouse protection will make people so caught off guard. Comedy is always based on tragedy. It depends on the way you look at it, but whether you are happy or sad. "" This sentence is like the truth, in the back of the film continues to revolve around my head, how funny the whole film, the final regret is as heavy as tears.<br/><br/>Through a less unexpected, the film hit the audience deep inside the plot, turning all the supporting roles and bridges that brought laughter in front of them into tearful ones. With Joe Joe's relationship with Jewish girl Aisha, not only did the hostility gradually ease, but Joe also finally realized his mistake in understanding others and found himself who he really was. Scarlett. Johnson's mother said to Joe: ""when you fall in love with someone, you feel butterflies flying in your stomach."" It was just that when Joe Joe finally realized the feeling, his mother had left him forever.<br/><br/>The pain and growth of ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe""<br/><br/>Baijia / Yiqi movies<br/><br/>""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" unfolds the real world wrapped in sugar with a light and smooth rhythm, turning the boy from blind obedience to questioning the growth story into a warm and sad war fairy tale. I can fully feel the director trying to tell through the film the loss and gain, pain and joy, loss and bravery that he may experience in the process of growing up, and magnify the nature of love and hope in life. As far as I am concerned, I have recently seen a lot of movies about children stepping into the adult world, but only ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" can do without any children. The head makes such a huge contrast, bringing a very strong resonance and reflection space.<br/><br/>I like ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" to bring out the merciless war of World War II through the change of character's point of view and mood, and the contrast highlights the warmth and precious emotion between family and family. The film is full of emotion, not only as the director of the boy's imaginary father Hitler. Videtti brightened his eyes, Scarlett Joe Hansen and Sam. The Rockwell supporting actors were also perfectly interpreted, taking the audience to see that although there were many things we should cherish in the most cruel times, just as Jews were no different from us, so were the children in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The core theme of ""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe""<br/><br/>Baijia / Yiqi movies<br/><br/>Although Joe Joe failed to break the head of a rabbit, in order to prove that he had robbed a grenade from the instructor and only hurt himself, when he ended up in a world of war full of hatred, only by plucked up the courage to cross and face up to the reality that people wanted to escape, so that he could become an independent individual to explore the future, and face more difficulties and challenges that must be borne by himself in the future. Perhaps this is what each of us must experience. Or have already experienced, look back still feel a little melancholy process.<br/><br/>""the fantasy world of young Joe Joe"" is not to criticize the evil deeds of the Nazis, nor to preach the value of freedom and democracy, but to present it from one of the purest angles. The damage caused by this war, and once again stresses that ""everything must be learned in person"", a core value that is still very important to this day. When we see the true appearance of the world and understand the rules of the game that survive in this society, do we also have to learn from it? Shouldn't you let yourself turn a blind eye to the good and evil in it? Choose to work hard for the overall beauty and progress? I think it's all the theme the movie finally wants to convey."

","This movie at times feels like its for kids almost with its child like humor. But other times you can tell it's very much for adults. The childlike elements of it I think are what have me disliking some of it. The first hour especially. Thankfully the last hour really is where things finally get good and enjoyable. There ends up being more emotions that just sillness and child like stuff.<br/><br/>I read alot of the reviews where they said it makes light of WW2, but while there are some ""silly"" parts, if you listen you can see the whole thing makes fun of the nazis. Such as when one man remarks about about a boy and how he can use a knife but not a grenade, but the mom in a serious (but sarcastic way for the viewer) that its ok if her underage son goes to a useless war and if he uses a gun. Thus mocking how crazy the nazis were.<br/><br/>I don't want to say this a ""deep thought"" kind of movie, but you really need to pay attention to everything to catch just how much the nazis are mocked. On the other side of things when it comes to any death, it does not make it funny. It still shows the horror (well of screen) of what went on. I think they did a good job on towing the line between tasteful and distasteful.<br/><br/>This all said its worth a watch if you have nothing else to do really. If you make it past the first hour without being bored, the last half makes it worth it. I should note the director, the actors...etc are all jewish in real life. They all had family involved in the holocaust. I'm not saying if your jewish and ok with this movie that the movie is ok to do, but I am saying I doubt anyone who is jewish would do a movie that they felt was distasteful about what happened."

","In the lens of Taiga Viditi, there are not only the colorful world of spring, but also the magnificent and wonderful fantasy. If the former promotes the development of the plot as a hint of emotion and rhythm, then the latter is metaphor and symbol. Freedom Kingdom, the strangeness and indifference of Taiga films made me choose to examine the latter topic, and the reason why I juxtaposed ""composition art"" and ""metaphorical symbols"" is based on this understanding-Taiga In addition to the pure expressiveness of visual aesthetics, composition art has another connotation of metaphorical symbols, which is also its poetic nature.<br/><br/>However, I think the charm of metaphor lies in its openness. Everyone can put forward different views. In the metaphorical world and the symbolic kingdom, there is no right or wrong, but only cleverness and beauty. However, the standard of this judgment is extremely Personalized, just as the beauty of the mirror is not that it reflects much of the world, but that everyone can reach its own ideal state through it, so unmistakable instructions and well-founded arguments are just a thousand paths. This article does not intend to enumerate the path taken by the author, but only provides a number of pregnant intersections for visitors to choose and follow. In other words, the author thinks that the image is the image. The value of the metaphor itself is far higher than its interpretable meaning.

But in my experience, no one had ever seen in fascism and war something...from a game. For something like that, I'll be right to a film ¬´La Vita e bella¬ª (1997). Nazis from the film ¬´Jojo Rabbit¬ª are just grown-up kids, who still play shooters. Adults have no idea how to live in this crazy world, so everyone plays in games and sacrifice part of mind, so they doesn't want all of them in the most brave moments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, kids should back down from their fantasies and grow up because of childish adults around them. But creators claims that if children will free to love and dance, all will be good for them.<br/><br/>The director of ¬´Jojo Rabbir¬ª Taika Waititi makes us laugh by showing fascism like an absurd idea, in which Hitler without any problems can be an imaginary friend, which imagine many children as clown or fairy creature. Laughing is a key to stop wars, because it doesn't make yourself hatred against other. This tactful mixing laughing with touchy tragedy let you be so loveful to this world as much as this film.<br/><br/>A few words about production. The cast is amazing, kids are sweetie and extremely talented under the carry of genius adults. Also I had never seen so pretty color palette in films about war.

The story is told in deeply personal way this time. No sweeping battles or mass executions. Instead, big themes are stripped down to essential elements that leave the viewer with nowhere to retreat or hide. The satire and dark humor, however, gives some reprieve from the shock and horror of Nazi tactics used to maintain control and to force regular people to commit unspeakable acts. Unfortunately, the ending provides no message on how to avoid a similar fate in the future."

","For some strange reason, I still think of this movie. I've known of Taika for at least 2 years, and I was waiting this movie, because the premise was... really interesting and funny. And it was my grand surprise, when it was amazing.
This movie made me laugh, chuckle and in no moment I was bored, I was trapped by the plot and how Jojo grows, as he is a child man. The thoughts of the third reich German people is awful, yet Taika also makes it funny, and humanize them. And now that I talked about how the movie was really funny, let me tell you, how moving, how shocking it was.
How Jojo can see away of his blind fanaticism, and grows to see that the nazi ways is not the right way, and starts connecting with the jew girl, when he was starting to see Hitler as the evil man he is, thanks to his mother, just when hi is starting to see that, everything goes wrong, not gonna say what happens, but, it shocked me, and while the room was filled with tears, I was in absolute shock, nothing afterwards that specific scene, was funny, I got out wanting to go in again, which... I did, and I couldn't think of anything better than, damn, and everytime I watched it, got me astonished, wordless, with a knod in my throat.
All of this movie is awesome, and great."

","I went to the cinema completely blind as to what this was about or where/when it was set so had no preconceptions when viewing. At first I'll admit I felt a little awkward laughing about what we all know is a dark, tragic situation but slowly I started to see the story as its supposed to be viewed, through the rose-tinted eyes of a young German boy. The story progresses beautifully as we see his character and view of his situation develop through the tail end of WW2. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson bringing a wildly different angle to Nazi portrayal. This to me was a masterclass of how to make a movie based on a story with such outrageous characters - especially 'Hitler' as a wacky/supportive/fun imaginary friend. This could have been a horribly offensive, mess of a movie but its not, its beautiful, its tragic and hilarious, most of all a must for any movie lover. You'll never have seen anything like it."

","While I recently saw Amazon's Hunters and rooted to like it, but instead ended up hating it for stealing from us, Jewish people, the heroics of justice and revenge blended with a poor taste Hollywood political correctness, I loved every second of Jojo!
I am daughter of a child Holocaust survivor from Eastern Europe and such movies hit a deep chord. Jojo though I loved, in the same vein as Life Is Beautiful and Train of Life.
The noir British humor, the absurdism a la Eugene Ionesco, the lush cinematography, fantastic photo direction (all takes are perfectly centered around the vanishing point), the high end costumes and interiors create a beautiful aesthetic experience.

This film delivers so many fantastic little moments of hilarity as well as sadness. The fact that this film gets to be made is something I think we underestimate and is free speech in effect.<br/><br/>Child actors can very often produce a hit or miss performance, but Roman Griffin Davis makes you really, really care for little Jojo with a sound performance - if he gets to work some more on his accent he'll be flawless as far as innocence goes. Scarlett Johansson gives it her absolute all, what an amazing performance by her.<br/><br/>Taika Waititi. Just bravo. What a mind this guy has. First he co-creates one of the most underrated comedies of our time; What we do in the shadows, and now he creates this fantastic piece of cinema as well as act amazingly in it as well.<br/><br/>The fact a film I can summarize as ""a kid on the track of being a Hitler jugend, struggles with his convictions after a series of absurd situations with his imaginary friend: Adolf Hitler"" can both make you laugh as well as get choked up to the point of tears is just a testament to the brilliant writing as well as the acting.

I personally have never watched ""Life is Beautiful"" or any other films of that blend but I can kinda picture how the story goes along. ""Jojo Rabbit"" does not move along in that direction. The majority of the film is light hearted and comical (with dashes of drama in between), until Jojo (played with great charm by Roman Griffin Davis) loses his mother (played brilliantly by Scarlett Johansson). As much as this film is about humanity and the effects of war, it's ultimately a coming of age story. Jojo grows up, he even kick's his imaginary Adolf Hitler (played by the writer-director of this film) out of the window. All the performances were great, the lines are all funny, and the use of music was really spot on. It was really worth going to a theater farther away from my house."

","Jojo Rabbit from Taika Waititi, the talented New Zealand director who brought us Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor: Ragnarok. This time, Taika used a new way to tell the WWII story, and this time via a boy Nazi's eyes to see this human tragedy. With Best Adapted Screenplay as the golden guarantee, Jojo Rabbit, without any doubts, should in your top 10 films of the year.<br/><br/>In this film, labels are the key topic of the story. Without too many narratives about Nazi's offences, this film once has been criticized as may mislead the audiences about WWII and the true face of Nazi. However, in my opinion, WWII is just a background set, using this special time to discuss the key argument about humanity.<br/><br/>Twentieth Century Fox Film
Jojo, a young boy who brought up by Nazi education, within that special environment, all the behaviour of him could be explained. But Jojo is just as same as other kids, no correct knowledge about the world or Jewish people. But in the deep of his heart, he knows what a right person's behaviour should do. Hurting innocent would definitely not on his list.<br/><br/>If over criticised Jojo would not willing to hurt innocent, because of his age, that would be so wrong, as captain K, who I believe joined the force with no choice or finally realized the true face of the Nazi, what he has done on the battlefield is unforgivable, but saved Elsa's life and protect Jojo which need great courage cannot be forget (I do believe that Captain K knew the tragedy about Rosie then he realized that Jojo may in great danger.)<br/><br/>Twentieth Century Fox Film

"kirbylee70-599-526179","10","0","2","9 March 2020"," ANTI-HATE HUMOR
","There is very little in the world that you can't turn into something humorous. Don't get me wrong, there are a few items I won't mention. But back in 1967 director/writer Mel Brooks showed that even Hitler and the Nazis could be funny with ""Springtime for Hitler"" in his film THE PRODUCERS. Now director writer Taika Waititi uses the same setting, Nazi Germany, for a darkly humorous and troubling film called JOJO RABBIT.<br/><br/>Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten year old boy living in Nazi Germany during the final years of the war. Like all good young German children, Jojo is part of the Hitler youth and excited about his trip to camp with the group where they will learn things like killing, bombing and hand to hand combat. He and his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) can't wait to get there.<br/><br/>Things aren't quite what he expected once there. Certainly all the items promised are delivered by camp commandant Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), a German officer who's been assigned here after a mishap during his last command. He goes about his day half interested with his flash nearby and with the aid of the more destructive Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson) providing help.<br/><br/>But things change when Jojo refuses to kill a rabbit just to show he is willing to kill. From this he gets the nickname Jojo Rabbit. Talking to his best invisible friend, the leader himself Adolph Hitler (Waititi) he convinces himself to show his bravery, runs up taking a grenade from Klenzendorf's hand during training and throws it only to have it bounce off a tree and land next to him. This results in injury and scarring and Jojo is sent home.<br/><br/>This is all fine with his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson). Rosie dotes on her son and allows him his daydreams of fighting for the Reich alongside his long gone father. One day while she's out Jojo hears a noise upstairs. Investigating he finds a young girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) hidden in a secret room off of his deceased sister's bedroom. Frightened at first it doesn't take long for him to realize that this girl is a Jew and has been hidden her by his mother.<br/><br/>Being a loyal Nazi what does he do? Does he turn her in? Or does he allow his love for his mother to override his duty? To decide what to do he converses with his imaginary best friend who suggests that he use her to gain information. He sets out to write a book about Jews that he can then present to the Fuhrer himself.<br/><br/>From here we are transported into both the worlds of Jojo's imagination in his discussions with his imaginary friend and the harsh reality of the world that surrounds him. The moments with Hitler are the funniest parts of the film, with him acting un-Hitler like and offering more comedy than inducing fear. But there are scenes of Jojo walking with his mother through town where a make shift scaffold has been set up in the town square with Jews hung there in public for all to see. It is this back and forth of the sadness and terror of war set beside things like the humor in Jojo's beliefs of Jews as being horned devils that makes the film strange while at the same time making it work.<br/><br/>To bring a film like this to life takes the efforts of all involved. Waititi has done a fantastic job with the handling of the story, earning an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. His direction here shows why he's an up and coming force to be reckoned with, able to handle things like his previous dark comedy WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS to the super powered Marvel film THOR: RAGNAROK. His performance as Hitler here strikes all the right notes making him the funniest character in the film.<br/><br/>The movie would have fallen on its face had they not found the perfect young actor for the lead role. Davis is just that actor, making Jojo the most sympathetic character here rather than the monster he could have been as a Hitler youth. McKenzie brings to her character a subtle touch of fear while at the same time being a strong character at the same time. And Johansson shows why she's a much better actress than folks give her credit for. She's more than a spandex wearing superhero which is what most associate her with. She carries her own here with a character that you care for as much as Jojo does.<br/><br/>It's a difficult mix to combine the horrors of war with comedy and not easily done. Waititi has done so here with moments that are hilarious but frightening at the same time. It tackles a subject from a viewpoint no one has before and while doing so provides a strong stance against violence. War isn't something to be taken lightly and the fact that children were propagandized like this should be a scary thought to consider. But perhaps, as with Jojo, they can come to realize not everything they're told is true."

","SYNOPSIS:
Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a young aspiring Nazi who's imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) and discovers that his mother is hiding a Jew in their home.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Taika Waititi does a wonderful job both as director and as Hitler. This film does a beautiful job with satire and approaching the topic in a way that's not going too far and has a lot of heart.
POSITIVES:
Taika Waititi is plain and simply a genius. Creates a warm atmosphere off a very cold subject. Making it very funny whilst not making the subject a joke. Very clever writing and he also makes it more so clowning on Hitler and nazi's rather than glorifying it. He may be the only person able to make a film like this. You had marvelous acting from Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie, but the absolute scene snatcher is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. I thought the Supporting Actress category was very stacked and I honestly was hoping for Scar Jo to take home the nom as she also had a phenomenal main role in Marriage Story. Between Scar Jo and Florence Pugh I was really riding for (even though I knew Laura Dern had it in the bag and also had a great performance). You then had Sam Rockwell, Stephen Merchant, Rebel Wilson and Alfie Allen all having wonderful supporting roles to complete a well selected cast.
NEGATIVES:
I'm going to get so much hate for this, but honestly I didn't think Archie Yates was great like everyone else thought. I thought his character has the potential to be very funny, but ultimately some of the delivery fell flat for me. Now, I'm not saying his performance was atrocious or irredeemable, I just didn't find it all that great. He's a child actor and has potential, just didn't work here for me. There was a very serious action that took place in the third act of the film that I felt was brushed over quite quickly. This wasn't something to just brush off. I really felt they should've took more time with what happened to let the audience really feel the impact.
CONCLUSION:
This film has a lot to offer whether it's laughs or smiles or tears and it's directed and written in such a way that allows you to do that without consciously thinking about if it's okay to do with the subject matter. There's a lot of heart in this film and the back and forth between Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie was beautiful. Unfortunately, I felt some bug points in the film were brushed over and I wasn't all in on all of the delivery. Still a great film that anyone could enjoy. 6.9/10."
"jamiedarlow-37510","10","0","1","9 February 2020"," An essential watch!
","A modern masterpiece starting off the year perfectly that encompasses so many genres, it's certainly unique! Based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens and set in World War II, we follow a 10 year old boy named Jojo who is growing up under the world wide influence of Nazi control, speaks to Hitler quite often in his imagination and ultimately just wants to be part of a group. He finds out his mother is hiding a young Jewish girl in their home and all sorts of conflicted feelings start occurring. What follows is the emotional growth and realisation that Jojo is not a nazi; he does not belong under an evil dictatorship and there is much more to living life positively than obsessing over war. Writer/Director Taika Waititi (What We Do In The Shadows, The Hunt for the Wilder People) has created his finest work through sheer bravery in a bittersweet comedy/drama taking place in a horrendous historical event. The horror of the nazi regime during World War II is explored with some devastating sequences, including an incredibly intense home visit from the gestapo led by a surprisingly menacing Stephen Merchant on superb form to a disturbing revelation at the beginning of the third act. All the while however, the overall effect feels positive and it's a film that completely celebrates humanity's good side in the face of segregation and nihilism. But it's not all dramatic; it's a film with pure glowing heart and huge belly laughs also from an incredible cast. Waititi casts himself as Jojo's imaginary friend, Adolf, and simultaneously blends the evil dictatorship as well as great humour delightfully poking fun at the Nazis through a 10 year olds perspective and adding a wonderfully weird fantastical element to the story. Sam Rockwell's Captain K and his buddy Finkel played by Alfie Allen are incredible every time theyre on screen and add much also to the pathos of the story (their battle image is just fantastic!)<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson is a real stand out here; her role as Jojo's mother is so important and she is truly the joyful heart and soul to the film. Thomasin McKensie is great as the young girl living with Jojo and his mother and has some wonderful pieces of dialogue that really highlight the ridiculousness of discrimination. Of course a big shout out has to be made to Roman Griffin Davis in the lead role who is absolutely phenomenal; not only is his comic timing perfect but he also keeps the heart strings tugging at certain emotional junctures of the story. Shoes play a powerful role here and are part of one of the most effective visual narrative progressions that I can ever remember seeing. The soundtrack is hugely memorable, the production design is spot on, the tonal shifts work completely to create a hugely entertaining film. The seriousness of the subject matter is always present and ultimately makes a fantastic message of sustaining a positive attitude and individuality even more so than ever and ensure as a species that these horrific events can never be repeated again. I really loved it and it should be seen by everyone. Oh and Jojo's best buddy Yorki played by Archie Yates is just brilliant!"

Taika Watiti is able to take us on a journey that is like life - traveling through an emotional landscape from comedy to tragedy to poignancy and back again. There are scenes that just make you gasp, they are so unexpected and jarring. Then there are others that prompt belly laughs. According to Sam Rockwell, Taika ""has a really good comedy compass.""
In Hitler's Germany toward the end of WWII, the Nazis are so desperate that they recruit and train 10 year old boys and girls to be ready to fight when the Allies invade their towns. This of course sets up any number of comic situations. Jojo is such a gung-ho little Nazi that his imaginary friend is Hitler himself, who is hysterically portrayed by the director. But the hate and brutality of the Third Reich pops up throughout from time to time, creating contrast that keeps us on the edge of our seats.
The boy, Roman Griffin Davis, is extraordinary in his acting. As you can tell from all the award nominations and wins, the entire cast is excellent, as well as the writing, costumes, editing, etc. Everyone involved in the making of this film talks about how much fun they had.
While there are similarities to Life is Beautiful - a young boy is protected by his parent from the horrors and truth of Hitler's reign - one also has to give a nod to The Producers by Mel Brooks where the play Springtime for Hitler has the monster singing and dancing in silly songs.
In the end, the message of the film comes through that even in the face of unspeakable evil and cruelty, the humanity of enough people will manage, through courage, sacrifice, humor and open hearts, to restore a sense of compassionate community."

"wikumk","7","0","1","8 February 2020"," Good, but could be better...here's how
","This wasn't a bad movie, it was a good movie with the potential to be a great movie.<br/><br/>PROS
<ul><li>very funny - genuine laugh out loud moments</li><li>great acting by all</li><li>great first half, good intro and development of characters</li></ul><br/><br/>
CONS
<ul><li>the second half of the movie was too predictable, there was no punchline ending, no deeper meaning, it was cliche. Movies like pans labraynth and life is beautiful had their similar moments of surrealism, but ended up showing the horror of the war that came afterwards. But jojo ends with the dancing of the main characters on a street that should have been teeming with post war destruction and rape that we know was the reality of the war. All I could see when was 'man these kids are in for a world of hurt'. It skipped out on an upbeat level of optimism that I think takes away from portraying an authentic picture of the war. Some may argue that this was childhood innocence maybe for the last time before the reality of pain take a over, but I felt it to be lacking. Other films like inglorious bastards recreated the entire history, which then makes it fine to have a positive ending. But jojo decided to keep to the real world events, but opted for a jarring fantasy ending.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>hitler was the side of jojo that wanted to feel needed and accepted, and it took the form of hitler who he loved and admired. But, as he is a friend and creation of jojo, I think it would have been more interesting for imaginary hitler to adopt and reflect the changes jojo undergoes as he falls in love. It would have been a powerful symbol if his hitler was sympathizing and supporting of his decisions to help the girl, while the real hitler was out there killing millions of Jews. I think by having him eventually kick his hitler out of a window played into hands of the predictable, where as this could of been a moment of a deeper exploration into good and evil. Imagine a movie that makes you adore hitler.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>they could of done more with the rabbit part. The film is called jojo rabbit, he identifies himself as the rabbit early on with scenes of great set up - not killing the rabbit and then his talk with his hitler, so I thought that theme could of been fleshed out more. Maybe put him into a situation into the climax of the movie where he consciously has to decide to be the rabbit and use his rabbit brain, and do something that only he can do. Perhaps the antagonist (the guy who killed the rabbit) could have been a part of him proving himself in the same way that PK had to prove himself in the film the power of one against the one German boy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the movie tried to occupy too many scenes. I think the story would of worked better if they kept it mostly within the house. When they started going outside with the battles, it lost a lot of the tension as the film was trying to do too much. It could have indicated the war was intensifying, which was done well when they are at the window looking at the battle, but the movie map was too big. But what was the real point of jojo witnessing the war? There would have been better ways in order to show the effect of the war other than him running around seeing the horror.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>casting: rebel Wilson plays the same character in every movie I found. Her scenes I felt just took away from the power of the scenes. While I found jojo and hitler to be funny, rebel only made the scenes silly and not in the good way. And scarlett did a good job, but all I could see was black widow. I therefore found her character distracting and drawing attention to the fact that I was watching a movie, and i couldn't get lost in the movie. Scarlett and rebel didn't bring anything unique to the role, and I think any other actress could have done those roles just as well with more benefit to film. This is the downside of being too famous. Had they used ordinary but real German actors I think it would have gone a long way.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>some of the actors were speaking in a French or british accent when they were meant to be German</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Yorki was very cute, but they really could have used him differently. I feel that all his job was to look as cute as possible. He and no character arc or plot drive. If rebel Wilson's character used him to kamakazi himself then that would be powerful. I liked him, I just don't get why he was there.</li></ul>"
"Ledwek","7","0","1","7 February 2020"," A few inaccuracies and iffy story beats but a fun film overall
","It's an undeniably enjoyable watch. I kind of wish though that Jojo's imaginary Hitler friend had more of an impact on his decision-making throughout the film and brought about more conflict in his choices, rather than mostly being a passive gimmick for comedy purposes. Additionally, there's a few story beats that undeniably make little sense (even with suspension of disbelief) and some surface level historical inaccuracies, both of which took me out of the film a bit.
For example:<br/><br/>Jojo has a grenade blow up next to him. He's rushed to hospital, and comes out with nothing but a lightly scarred face. Got off pretty lucky there with all his limbs and facial features intact...<br/><br/>Hitler continuously offers Jojo cigarettes, when in reality Hitler was quite heavily against smoking and ran anti-tobacco campaigns.<br/><br/>After Jojo's mother gets executed, he's just left living on his own and fending for himself. Pretty sure in reality the Nazi police would immediately follow up on the fact that Rosie has a young son and quickly raid her home and take the boy. I think a totalitarian government would definitely notice this 11 year old boy's presence...<br/><br/>Also, I'm not too sure if Nazi Germany's town centres even had public hangings, but correct me if I'm wrong there.<br/><br/>On the flipside though, Rosie's death was particularly effective, and was probably the most memorable and emotional scene in the movie."

","Right, well I didn't really know what I was getting myself into when I sat down to watch the 2019 movie ""Jojo Rabbit"", except for knowing it to be a comedy of sorts and that it was set during World War II.<br/><br/>I must say that ""Jojo Rabbit"" is a very unique movie, and it was a funny approach for a movie revolving around events of World War II. This is definitely not something you'd see in other war movies. For better or worse, some might not like it, however, I happened to enjoy it quite a lot. It was a refreshing take on a matter as serious as World War II.<br/><br/>And director and writer Taika Waititi managed to create a movie that had equal amounts of seriousness and comedy to it, in a way that really worked well in favor of the movie. To Taika Waititi's praise, I must say that this movie was enjoyable, quirky, sure, but enjoyable.<br/><br/>The movie had wonderful props, sets and costumes, and they had a glorious cast ensemble to perform the various roles in the movie. I must say that I really enjoyed the performance of Taika Waititi in the role of Adolf Hitler, that was just brilliant and hilarious. I was surprised to see Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson in a movie such as this, but they complimented the movie quite well. I think it was a shame that Rebel Wilson didn't have a larger part in the movie, because her character had so much to offer.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Jojo Rabbit"" from start to end, and I can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch this odd war movie. Lots of laughs throughout the course of the movie. This is definitely well worth the money, effort and time to sit down and watch.<br/><br/>I am rating the movie six out of ten stars."

"Skippy489","8","0","1","4 February 2020"," Artful film
","This movie is very interesting. It is a lot about the ethics of a person. It talks about why people do what they do, especially with social pressure to fit in. As the protagonist grows, you can see the change in him. He is struggling with his humanity. It also gives a good luck at the flip side of the war. Be Warned, there is historical racial slurs throughout the movie. At the same time, there is a scene where it shows the direct impact of racial slurs. It is an educational film.
As a comedy, it does have funny moments, some of the comic relief moments are uncomfortable and a little off color. This movie is more of a drama, it deals with the concepts of World War 2 in a mature manner. It is a coming of age film that shows the division of a family due to war conflicts."

","Jojo Rabbit must not have been an easy movie to sell. A movie featuring a Hitler youth boy in the last days of World War Two, with an actual Adolf Hitler as his imaginary friend. Sure, it's a satire, obviously, but even still... how do you get stuff like this green-lit?<br/><br/>Well, being Taika Waititi, one of the most unorthodox directors currently working, must have helped. Especially when he himself wanted to play the role of Hitler. And I must say, the film works rather well. It's able to make you laugh big time, while also telling a heart-wrenching story about the struggle of Jews and those wanting to help them during the Third Reich. To a certain point, but let's but that aside for a moment.<br/><br/>Because I want to praise the actors. Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa, the Jewish girl, does a great job as someone terrified out of her soul, but unwilling to show it, while Roman Griffin Davis shines as Jojo himself. I especially enjoy how clearly he changes throughout the course of the film, learning to see the world for what it is and not what he wants it to be. But the MVP award for this movie has to go to Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother. What a character! Full of lust and zest for life, as well as smiling maturity. Every scene she's in, especially when she's just talking to Jojo, I could watch forever.<br/><br/>All that being said, I did find myself struggling with the film when it came to mood swings. Whenever the film wants to be funny, it's funny enough. Whenever it wants to crush your soul under an iron boot, it does just that. It's only that these two aspects of the film have a hard time meeting. I found myself choking up because of a certain scene and then I'm expected to chuckle in the next scene.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure how you would go about fixing that. Perhaps if the humour had been even more absurd than it is? There are a few scene that go way over the line to absurdity, like Hitler eating a boiled unicorn head, but most of the time the humour is rather grim and/or dry. Then again, had the humour been more absurd, it might have cut tension from the truly dark scenes.<br/><br/>It's a movie I appreciated, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it. Or more accurately, I enjoyed every single scene on its own, but not necessarily together. Make of that what you will."

","So I didn't even really want to see ""Jojo Rabbit"" that much based on the reviews, the kind of movie the reviews confirmed it to be, and my past experience with Taika Waititi's style. I thought it would be another Wes Anderson rip-off, and I wasn't in the mood for another ""aren't Nazis goofy?"" comedy that tries to make light of the Holocaust by making Nazis look like buffoons (no thank you, ""Life Is Beautiful."")<br/><br/>But the movie buff in me hates not having an opinion about movies that strike a chord with the public, and the Academy Award completist in me wasn't sure I could live with myself if I didn't see every movie nominated for Best Picture this year. So I sucked it up and bought a ticket.<br/><br/>My 10 year old son is studying the Holocaust in school, and his class had recently gone to a Holocaust museum in the Chicago area, so I asked him if he wanted to see this movie with me. It was his first time attending a ""grown up"" movie (""Star Wars"" films aside, if those are considered to be grown up movies). He was clearly very proud to be attending a PG-13 movie with his dad, and the experience was made sweeter for him by the fact that his younger brother had to stay home (I couldn't tell from the parental advisory whether or not it would be appropriate for an 8 year old). So there I am watching a movie about a 10 year old boy sitting next to my 10 year old boy, and man did I get the feels. Everything people have criticized this movie for is true. It paints a very sanitized picture of Nazi Germany and downplays how awful it would have been to live it. The Holocaust is a vague spectre somewhere in the background, never overtly shown and never feeling like a serious threat. The message is big and obvious, the emotional manipulation rampant.<br/><br/>But what the hell. I kind of fell in love with this movie because of who I was seeing it with, and I loved that it was about learning to differentiate between the world as certain people (relatives, the media, our government, you name it) want you to perceive it and the world as you actually experience it. Yes, I knew my heartstrings were being tugged, and me in a different mood would have had none of it. But me in the mood I was in was all ""oh, let my heartstrings be tugged.""<br/><br/>I also have never picked a worse time to go to the bathroom during a movie in my entire movie watching career. I can't go into details without throwing in a major spoiler, but let's just say my son had to tell me what happened when I got back and I had to wonder if my absence during that critical moment would traumatize my son forever.

","Well, it's not ""Schindler's List"", and it might demonstrate a bit of Monty Python inspiration, but at heart this is a biting anti-hate film that uses drama and humor effectively to tell the story of a Nazi youth and a Jewish girl about to discover the world and themselves as part of the human condition. Films like this remind us that the differences that exist among disparate ethnicities or races are almost always an accident of birth, and if left unchallenged, people can generally learn to get along with one another. Young Johannes 'JoJo' Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is determined to uphold the will of The Fuehrer in the form of his imaginary friend Adolf (Taika Waititi, who doubles as the film's director), and is left conflicted over the actions of his mother (Scarlett Johansson) when he learns that she's been hiding a teenage Jewish girl in a disguised passageway of their German home. Over time, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) and JoJo form a relationship that evolves into friendship, and in JoJo's case, borders on a case of puppy love, all while in the midst of Allied forces about to break the back of the Nazi stranglehold on their home town.<br/><br/>You wouldn't think that a film dealing with Hitler would be fodder for comedy, but director Waititi manages to walk a fine line between drama and humor. There will be those viewers who vilify the picture for it's dialog and treatment of Jews, but that's one of the things that always bothers me about a movie's detractors. By showing what occurred at one time in history isn't the same thing as supporting those actions, as deplorable as they might have been. The picture finds it's balance in the caricatured treatment of Nazi villains like Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf, Gestapo leader Deertz (Stephen Merchant), and the riotous Fraulein Rahm, portrayed by Rebel Wilson. One might even conclude that Klenzendorf, as loyal as he was to the Nazi cause, had at least a spark of humanity by disavowing JoJo in the presence of American soldiers so the young boy wouldn't be considered a Nazi sympathizer.<br/><br/>I couldn't think of a more perfect ending for the movie, reminding us of Elsa's promise to dance when she knew that the war was over and that she had finally acquired her freedom. Having survived great personal tragedy with the death of his mother and loss of a sister, JoJo looks himself in the mirror and vows that ""Today, just do what you can"". The closing soundtrack echoes JoJo's sentiments, and those of all people who are inspired to overcome their own unfortunate circumstances, as David Bowie's German lyrics relate how 'We can be heroes, just for one day'."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","7","0","2","22 January 2020"," An imperfect yet oddly compelling and very memorable movie
","It's been a little while since I saw Jojo Rabbit, and I neglected to review it straight away because it was somewhat difficult to work out exactly how I felt about it. It's a bold, entertaining, sometimes funny yet sometimes heartbreaking premise, it's confidently shot and well acted, it uses music to great effect, and also carries a strong, agreeable message. But something felt off, and it's prevented me from loving it as much as all those positive qualities would suggest. Perhaps the end result is less than the sum of its parts, but a rewatch at some point in the future could help things click a little better.<br/><br/>For now though, this is still a very good film that doesn't quite cross over into 'great' for me personally, but is still worth recommending. Looking at WW2 through the eyes of a child isn't something that's never been done before, but to have the child not only be on the side of the Germans but initially idolize the Nazi Party certainly feels like a new take. It mostly works, and I didn't find the film insensitive- or offensive for the sake of just being offensive- in any manner. Lampooning WW2 and the Nazi Party was done nearly 80 years ago, in Chaplin's The Great Dictator (while the war was still going no less!), let's not forget.<br/><br/>I was reminded of Chaplin playing a clear stand-in for Hitler in that film when watching Jojo Rabbit director Taika Waititi play (an imaginary friend version of) Hitler in this film. The best thing about this is the fact that Waititi is part Jewish and part Maori, so the real Hitler would have absolutely despised being portrayed by someone of Waititi's background. It's an entertaining performance and leads to many of the movie's funniest scenes, but one flaw with it is that I think the same story and its messages could still come across just fine without the imaginary Hitler subplot.<br/><br/>That might make the film overall less of a dramedy/tragicomedy and more of flat out war drama, and as for whether or not this would have made it better overall, I'm not sure. The comedy works, and when the film goes for drama, it works too. Neither really clashes. But still, as a whole it never clicked for me quite the way I wanted to. It could be on me more than it is on the film, especially because even now, almost a month after seeing it, I still can't put my finger on exactly what stopped me from absolutely loving this movie.<br/><br/>The only other mild problem I can cite is that the film drags slightly in its second act, with some of the scenes between Jojo and the girl he discovers hiding in his house's attic being not as engaging as other parts of the film. Oddly enough, this is the most prominent aspect of the film, but I found other characters- like Scarlett Johansson's and Sam Rockwell's- more interesting. It still works and eventually pays off well, but I didn't love every scene while the movie was happening.<br/><br/>It's been obvious since his Flight of the Conchords days that Waititi could write great scripts, but with Jojo Rabbit it's apparent that he's continuing to get even better as a director, with this being his most visually pleasing and well-directed movie yet. The screenplay is mostly great too, though the end product does not quite coalesce into something I totally loved. However I do want to see it again, and all the stuff I liked has really stuck with me.<br/><br/>Maybe for films like this, that are particularly tonally ambitious and out there in terms of some of their creative decisions, are simply worth watching and forming your own opinion on."

","Like many, when I first saw the poster for Jojo Rabbit - I took a sharp intake of breath. The sight of Taika Waititi, a director who I respect greatly, dressed as a whimsical version of Hitler, made me uneasy. Can an individual who caused misery to so many, who scarred and ended so many lives, be the centrepiece for a drama-comedy?<br/><br/>Indeed, particularly with the rise of neo-Nazism across the globe, there's a concern that in some way we make light of these atrocities.<br/><br/>It's with relief then, that writer and director Taika Waititi has managed to strike a balance between humour and a brutal teardown of the manners in which the Nazi party acted.<br/><br/>Set during WW2, Jojo Rabbit follows the story of Jojo Betzler (played astoundingly well by Roman Griffin Davis), a member of the Hitler Youth who iconises the Fuhrer, and strongly believes in the future of Nazi Germany. He quickly demonstrates a frightening level of nationalism, whilst revealing a fundamental lack of understanding of the concepts he is being told.<br/><br/>We're introduced to these elements during a Hitler Youth camp - a section heavily inspired by Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom. Indeed, for these first 20 minutes the film does struggle to find its own identity, and the audience I was with was evidence for this. We collectively were unsure about where the humour lay.<br/><br/>True, Sam Rockwell does a fantastic job as Captain Klenzendorf, the lackadaisical camp leader, and Rebel Wilson's brings her dry comedic chops to Fraulein Rahm as she feeds the children lies about Jewish people having horns (shockingly, a myth that was conceived in the Middle Ages and is apparently still prevalent today). But not all the jokes landed. I, for one, am also tired of campy homosexual relations being the butt of a joke.<br/><br/>A challenge here was that - Jojo Rabbit is clearly from the eyes of a child, demonstrating his innocence in the world. However, in this first section Waititi's needs to make this more obvious. Once we understand this then the perspective of what we are seeing changes - yes, the adults are sometimes incompetent - but do we have an unreliable narrator? This lens in which the film has been made helps make the comedy in it palatable and doesn't undermine the more unsettling and heart-rendering moments.<br/><br/>The act ends with Jojo being involved in an accident that leaves him scarred and disfigured. Jojo, feeling dejected, must then run simple errands around his town. Until one day he discovers that his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has been hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in their home.<br/><br/>As Elsa is introduced some of the shots could be directly taken out of the The Ring or The Conjuring. They are ridiculous, but they also emphasise the child's eye view that we are being fed. At this stage Jojo truly believes Jews to be devilish and something to fear. It's often said that there is a thin line between horror and comedy, and Waititi seem to have embraced this.<br/><br/>It is the relationships of Jojo and Elsa, and Jojo and his mother, that the film focuses on. His internal conflict, and his slow softening of heart to the ""enemy within"".<br/><br/>Similarly, Stephen Merchant's SS character, while superficially amicable and inane, manages to underline his character with a sinister tension and an uneasy sense of foreboding. Equally, Waititi's Hitler, loses his playful demeanor when Jojo starts to turn his back on him. The smiling faces slowly start to take on the visage of Stephen King's It.<br/><br/>The film also owes a debt to Four Lions - I've seen some criticism that the idiotic nature of many of the adult characters only serves to make light of the horrors of Nazism. However, just like Four Lions used this same inane-ness to steal the dignity away from extremist terrorists, Jojo Rabbit does the same. It mocks the rise in neo-Nazis and reduces their value.<br/><br/>Credit must also be given to the symbolism within the film. Some more obvious, like the use of the butterfly to represent Jojo's mother, to more subtle framing (Cinematographer: Mihai Malaimare Jr.) to emphasise the role of shoes within the film - as a symbol of maturity and freedom.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling at peace with the film that Waititi had set out to make. It tackles many difficult issues - and finds sympathy in a lot of unexpected places. However, it also pulls no punches - at its heart, while not a satire, it pulls apart the foundations of the Nazi party, and the methods used by extremists to indoctrinate the young."

","Set against the backdrop of WWII, ten-year-old Johannes Betzler (Davis) navigates his way through Nazi Germany accompanied by his imaginary friend Hitler (Waititi), albeit a more goofy, childish incarnation of the notorious tyrant. Aspiring to become one of Hitler's most trusted Nazi's, Johannes commences his first day at a Hitler Youth training camp with giddy optimism. Johannes is certain of his path towards becoming a full-fledged Nazi, until he learns his mother, Rosie (Johansson), is hiding a Jewish girl upstairs. Rosie's reservations and disapproval towards the war are a well-kept secret, confined within the walls of the Betzler household. Johannes is immediately suspicious of Elsa Korr (McKenzie), but rather than immediately turn her into the Gestapo, he chooses to learn about the people he's been indoctrinated into believing are the enemy. Given the subject matter it selects to satirise, Jojo Rabbit may have been a recipe for disaster in the hands of a lesser filmmaker. Fortunately, Waititi works wonders with the source material (Caging Skies by Christine Leunens) and produces a film that is both hilarious and tragic.<br/><br/>Waititi employs a brilliant line up for Jojo Rabbit. Davis and McKenzie are terrific as an aspiring Nazi/on the run Jew duo who's worlds are forced to collide in the midst of war, and Waititi's hilarious interpretation of the tyrannical leader is a performance very few could accomplish. Johansson's portrayal as a desperate single-mother operating in a society she's secretly opposed to whilst striving to do the right thing results in one of the more nuanced performances of her career, and Stephen Merchant's cameo as a Gestapo agent fuses both light humour with towering intimidation during one of the films tenser scenes. A fundamental strength of Waititi's screenplay is how it accomplishes the balance between comedy and tragedy. Jojo Rabbit has moments of gleeful silliness accompanied with clever, off-beat dialogue, but Waititi masterfully incorpates several gut punch moments that certainly hit hard during the films more sombre moments. For a Nazi-satire flick, it's surprisingly heartfelt. Perhaps most importantly, it never undermines the severe casualties brought about during Hitler's vile dictatorship. Waititi knows when to poke fun and when to tackle the material seriously. Jojo Rabbit is another great film from the New Zealand filmmaker and is absolutely worth watching; it's quirky, sincere and at times, strikingly real."

","To say that all Germans by default were Nazis is an unfair assessment especially when living under a political terror where the mind is predisposed to the propaganda machine. The lie and the idea becomes the truth and reality. The mind of a child is at greater risk; susceptible to the indoctrination of violent politics. The imagination is attacked and exploited for extremism. An adult, unlike a child, is at an age of reason; therefore you may find the former abhorrent, but what of the latter? This is the question Jojo Rabbit attempts to explore with caustic examination.<br/><br/>An exploration of how the imagination is hijacked makes for an ambitious topic. Waititi adopts a fitting satire and drama for this purpose, though at times can feel misguided. When balancing two approaches he treads a fine path between the sublime and the ridiculous. If you have ever been around children growing up you know they go through a phase of pretend. They are at play: whether it be with a Buzz Light Year costume or playing with Star War toys a child projects their imagination and identity into the role-play. Would a child in Nazi Germany be any different? The films denotes Nazism as hijacking this stage of growing up, represented in the make-believe Hitler character. This idea is aptly expressed in the imagery of the fuhrer eating a unicorn, a metaphor for the destruction of the imagination. The film's motif is littered with an array of both dramatic and satirical symbolism in the same manner as the unicorn. Mise en sc√®ne provides butterflies, knifes, mirrors, shoes and cigarettes representative for Jojo's internal conflict. For example: knifes and cigarettes are objects of assimilation. Mirrors stand in for character duality and shoes for repressed love."

"jboothmillard","7","0","2","11 January 2020"," Jojo Rabbit
","I was instantly attracted to this film the first time I saw the trailer, and I had a feeling it was going to have a Marmite reaction, audiences would either love it and go with it, or hate it, written and directed by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows, Thor: Ragnarok). Basically, Johannes ""Jojo"" Betzler (Golden Globe nominated Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year-old boy living in Nazi Germany during the later stages of World War II with his mother, Rosie (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Scarlett Johansson). His father is missing in action on serving on the Italian Front and his older sister Inge recently died of influenza. Jojo, who seems very passionate about Nazism, often talks with his imaginary friend, a supportive but childish version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). Jojo and his best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) attend a Hitler Youth training camp, run by the one-eyed Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell). When Jojo is ordered to kill a rabbit by older Hitler Youth members, he cannot bring himself to do it, and runs off crying being taunted by the other boys, calling him ""Jojo Rabbit"". After a pep talk from Adolf, Jojo returns and throws a hand grenade without permission. It bounces off a tree and explodes at his feet, leaving him with facial scars and a slight limp. After Jojo recovers, Rosie asks Klenzendorf, demoted after the incident, to make her son feel included despite his injuries. Jojo is given small tasks such as spreading propaganda leaflets throughout town and collecting scrap metal for the war effort. Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers a teenage Jewish girl hiding upstairs, Elsa Korr (Thomasin McKenzie), also his sister's former classmate. Jojo threatens to turn her over to the Gestapo, but Elsa warns that his mother would be killed for hiding her. He agrees to keep her safe, on the condition she reveals her ""Jew secrets"" so he can write a book for Klenzendorf, which amuses him. Elsa plays along and makes up stories that Jews have special powers, such as mind-reading. Jojo is angry with his mother for hiding a Jew, accusing her of being unpatriotic. Rosie dismisses his accusations; she believes that positivity and optimism are the best ways to be free of oppression. Jojo continues to interrogate Elsa, learning she has a boyfriend called Nathan with whom she wants to reunite when the war is over. Having potential feelings for her himself, Jojo forges a letter from ""Nathan"" which claims that he has found someone else and wants to break up with Elsa. Jojo feels guilty seeing her cry, and writes another letter retracting the first one, and argues with Adolf when he suggests Elsa is a monster. Later, while collecting metal, Jojo spots his mother leaving a ""free Germany"" message in town. Jojo is home one day when the Gestapo, led by Captain Deertz (Stephen Merchant), visit his house. Elsa reveals herself, pretending to be his sister Inge, their suspicions seem to be subsided when she confirms her birthday from memory. But Elsa realises she recited the wrong date, and that Klenzendorf, who also happened to arrive at the house during the visit, covered for her, she is confident she will be found out. Later that day, Jojo finds his mother has been hanged in the town square. Devastated, he returns home and tries to stab Elsa, but she comforts him when he breaks down. Jojo runs into Yorki, now a soldier, who tells him Hitler has committed suicide and that the Allies are closing in. A battle rages in the town, during which Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), arming and sacrificing children, is killed in an explosion. As the American and Soviet forces arrive, several Germans are captured, including a wounded Klenzendorf, who sacrifices himself to allow a captured Jojo to escape. The soldiers expel Jojo as Klenzendorf claims he is a Jew; he runs away as shots are heard. Jojo runs home, he wants to stop Elsa from leaving, so he lies, tells her that Germany won the war. Jojo gives her a ""new"" letter from Nathan, claiming that he and Jojo have found a way to smuggle her to Paris. Elsa confesses that her boyfriend died the previous year. Jojo tells her he loves her, and she tells him she loves him in a ""little brother"" way. The imaginary Hitler confronts Jojo for siding with Elsa, and Jojo kicks him out the window. Jojo takes Elsa outside, where she realises the Allies have won after seeing American soldiers. She slaps Jojo in the face for lying, and then they dance in the street. Also starring Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen as Finkel. Griffin Davis is a fantastic new young talent, Johansson is really good in her short time onscreen, the support of Rockwell, Wilson and Merchant are also great, and Waititi almost steals the show as the immature imaginary Nazi dictator the boy talks to. This works really well, seeing the war from the point-of-view of a child who is unaware of the full magnitude of it, obviously there is serious material, including anti-Semitism and the Nazi dictatorship, but it is funny and pokes fun where it can, not for everyone, but for me an enjoyable satirical wartime comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Taika Waititi, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, Original Music for Michael Giacchino, Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

","So everyone is saying this is not a comedy film & it turns dark throughout the film which is correct, but it has a mix of both rather than one or the other, the thing is with the dark parts to the film it is deemed normal within the film as of course back then it was normal for Nazis so laugh at Jews, for example; one scene JoJo makes a book about Jews and how bad they are, but when the german guards come in to check the house for a Jew hiding in the house they come across the book & all the guards read it & laugh about that it is in the book, but of course to them that is normal back then & portrayed as normal which does make you think.<br/><br/>But for the funny parts to the film they are in pockets throughout the film, Adolf (Played by Taika Waititi him self) as JoJo's imaginary friend is a great addition to the film as he pops up & does really funny things & says some funny things as well, but if it was nor for Adolf there would be far less funny parts which gets me onto my next point, apart from the Adolf parts there was not that much overall in the film, the beginning of the films starts off on a role with the comedy but then seems to fall flat through the mid section of the film which we (4 of us that watched it) ll said it felt flat & just talking & was a bit boring tbh, that's why i think without the funny parts the film would no where be as good hence why i didn't rate it that high.<br/><br/>Overall it is defiantly a watch because either way its a different take on war style films but not being about all guns & blazing violence for once.<br/><br/>Age - 25

"alysiakoloamatangi","8","0","1","10 January 2020"," Anti-Hate in the time of Hitler
","When I attempted to explain the plot of Jojo Rabbit to a friend of mine, they found it difficult to understand how the events of World War II could be framed as a comedy. ""I hate Nazis"" was their response. I was reminded that the use of an ironic tone can divide audiences between those who comprehend the nuances of meaning and those that don't. For that reason, I appreciate that some viewers may confound the historical context of the film with what it's actually about - overcoming hatred and tribalism.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit combines Taika Waititi's absurdity with the whimsy of Wes Anderson, culminating in a film that is at once strange and familiar. Its ""melancomic"" tone, which offsets irony and affect with sincerity and pathos, is certainly an Andersonian construct, as is the use of anti-realist settings to give the film a contained and artificial quality.<br/><br/>However, Waititi differs dramatically from Anderson in the niceness and likeability of characters who, in Anderson's hands, would most certainly have been depicted as precocious and self-centred. Accordingly, sympathy - particularly towards Jojo himself - is more strongly felt here than in any of Anderson's films. This can perhaps be attributed to Waititi's masterful ability to inhabit the head-space of a young boy. A memorable example is the following interaction Jojo has with his mother:<br/><br/>Rosie Betzler: Love is the strongest thing in the world.<br/><br/>Jojo Betzler: I think you'll find that metal is the strongest thing in the world, followed closely by dynamite and then muscles.<br/><br/>The charming script is of course reliant on a wonderful performance by Roman Griffin Davis, who delivers the above line (as well as many others) with the absolute self-assuredness that young children possess.<br/><br/>Waititi has said that Fox agreed to distribute Jojo Rabbit on the condition that he portray Hitler, who is Jojo's imaginary friend in this film. Waititi performs this role with commitment and zest. The character is so clearly a child's understanding of who Hitler would be and is an evocative device for demonstrating how Jojo's perception of the figure changes as the movie progresses. It is a window into Jojo's interiority and understanding of the world around him. I particularly enjoyed watching the imagined Hitler become more menacing as Jojo learns more about the world. It reflects how we so often construct a vision of our idols, and how this changes based on our interactions and experiences.<br/><br/>Sam Rockwell and Alfie Allen gave strong performances as Captain Klenzendorf and Finkel, an eccentric pair who run the Hitler Youth training camp. I was particularly struck by how Captain Klenzendorf's own disillusionment foreshadows the journey that Jojo himself will undertake . Meanwhile, Finkel's character development can be observed in the periphery of many scenes, providing viewers with an enjoyable easter-egg type experience and lending a re-watchable quality to the film.<br/><br/>The decision to cast Stephen Merchant as a captain of the Gestapo was masterful. He is at once creepy and hilarious in this film- his very proportions lent his scenes a sense of physical comedy. In the theatre where I saw Jojo Rabbit, the audience began laughing as soon as he appeared on screen.<br/><br/>Jojo Rabbit is a success. It is hilarious and warm, and I will always hold a special place in my heart for a film that ends with children dancing awkwardly to Heroes, followed by an intriguing quote:<br/><br/>Let everything happen to you
Beauty and terror
Just keep going

"dromasca","8","0","1","7 January 2020"," the coming to age of the rabbit
","'Jojo Rabbit', Taika Waititi's film arouses controversy among film critics and viewers. Normal for a satirical comedy dealing with the darkest period in history? Perhaps, however, we should not be so shocked anymore, and not because almost eight decades have passed since the horrific events, but because World War II, the Holocaust and even Hitler's persona have already been subjects of comedy and satire in numerous films, some even very good - starting with Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator', continuing with the French comedies with Louis de Funes, moving on to Roberto Benigni's superb and moving film 'Life is Beautiful' and reaching Tarantino. And yet, Taika Waititi was able to make this film only by financing it as a producer and making it as a director and as an actor in the most delicate role - Adolf Hitler's as an imaginary friend of a ten-year-old boy raised in the poisonous atmosphere of the Third Reich and fanatical in his worship of the Fuhrer and in his hatred of Jews. The film describes the tragic coming to age and awakening to reality of Jojo, the aspiring Nazi child, unable to kill a rabbit, hence the nickname in the film's title, during a disastrous war ending for the world he believed in and he lived by until then.<br/><br/>The directorial approach and the style in which the story is exposed, at least in the first part of the film, resembles nothing of what I saw on screens in the films about World War II. In fact, the film may be looked at differently: as a combination of coming to age and early exit from childhood movies in extreme conditions (Giuseppe Tornatore's 'Malena' would be another example) and an anti-racist and anti-militaristic satire with clear references to the contemporary period. As a film about the war and the Holocaust, 'Jojo Rabbit' does not say many new things. Jojo's conquering character splendidly played by Roman Griffin Davis, one of the most memorable children's roles of late, dominates the film. The world we see on the screen is his world, with the fears and imagination of a ten year old boy raised in the shadow of war and educated in a twisted ideology. The relationship between his mother (Scarlett Johansson) and Jojo is a relationship mixing love and fear, the mother's fear of the monster that her son might become, maternal protection combined with the fear that Jojo may, intentionally or not, denounce her for her opinions and actions.<br/><br/>The film works very well in the first part, the grotesque kitsch of Nazi education and the sick fantasy of the kid's 'imaginary friend' Adolf Hitler managing to create the effects expected by the director. Things get a little complicated when Jojo discovers the ""enemy"", a Jewish girl his mother was hiding in their home at the risk of her life, and who, to his surprise, has neither horns nor tentacles. Here begins the process of awakening and coming to age, accelerated by the approach of the end of the war, which brings with it the destruction and death that the fanatical children born and educated in Nazism had been hitherto spared of. The story now slips into melodrama, not before providing one more grotesque and tense scene, when the family home is visited by Gestapo. The ending is less original, and the mix of dream (actually a nightmare in this phase) and reality is no longer as interesting. Until then, however, 'Jojo Rabbit' has already provided many interesting ideas, original and moving sequences, and a lesson that stays with the viewers about the grotesque of hate. Taika Waititi's film may not be an immediate public success, but its fame may develop and last into the future instead."

","The Stream: The whipsaw changes in tone can be disorienting and highlight lulls in the forward momentum of the story.<br/><br/>The Big Screen: Compelling performances from a good cast bring offbeat humor and depth of emotion.<br/><br/>The Final Bill: It is humorous with a distinct point of view and a heartfelt message, but if you're not on the wavelength with that point of view, you won't get it.<br/><br/>-Trip Fontaine<br/><br/>How do you solve a problem like Jojo? He's a 10 year-old, Hitler Youth with Adolf as an imaginary friend. Does he understand what it all means? Or, does he really just want to play dress up and be a part of a club, as is suggested by one of the other characters. How does a 10 year old navigate this complicated and dangerous world? Jojo Rabbit explores these themes and more through a delicate balance of satire and drama. Taika Waititi wrote and directed Jojo Rabbit, which is based on a novel by Christine Leunens called Caging Skies; and he brings his special brand of boffo comedy - even portraying Jojo's imaginary confidante, Adolf. It's both wacky and serious. Sometimes it is both within the span of minutes.<br/><br/>I have had a difficult time digesting Jojo Rabbit because I wanted it to be more impactful to me than I felt it was. It's a coming of age story with many of the tropes that a coming of age story has. Jojo is destined to learn a lesson. On the other hand, Waititi, as writer, director and cast member, has a strong point of view about lampooning the ridiculousness of Nazism and through his brand of humor dismantles other hate-filled ideologies. In that way, the film is novel and a worthy viewing. The whole thing can be disorienting, which may take some audience members out of the overall experience of the film.<br/><br/>Roman Griffin Davis plays Jojo. This kid is great. He has the weight of this sometimes silly and sometimes very serious movie on his shoulders. Through the eyes of this child, we see and question war, ideology, love and loss. Davis always seems appropriately in tune with his character. There are other great performances by Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother and Thomasin McKenzie as the mysterious stranger Jojo develops a relationship with. I'll say that Waititi's Adolf is very impactful in his brief scenes; and there's a hilarious and threatening cameo by Stephen Merchant. The only out of place and unnecessary cast member is Rebel Wilson, which is true of most of the roles she's portrayed. No offense to you, Ms. Wilson.<br/><br/>Overall, Jojo Rabbit is a good movie that should be seen. It will not be what you expect. The balance of comedy and drama achieved by Waititi didn't always work to me. If you are not calibrated to this satirical tone, then you may not enjoy Jojo's ride. I say proceed to the theater with caution."
"harrylosborne","7","0","1","7 January 2020"," Charming, innocent fun that doesn't shirk the gravity of the issue
","I imagine Taika Waititi's pitch to whichever film board gave him funding was an unusual one: a Jewish director wanting to make a Nazi-based comedy, where he would also play an imaginary Hitler. He was probably met with some raised eyebrows, some looks of disbelief, and maybe even a few laughs of incredulity. Regardless, this script and plot is airtight, portraying a child's formative years as a fanatic (albeit useless) member of the Hitler Youth, whilst also harbouring a Jewish refugee. The comedy is inoffensive and caters for all ages, with strong performances from some of Hollywood's most eminent figures. The seriousness of the issue, however, is never completely avoided, and Jojo Rabbit does a good job of still getting the point across about indoctrination and the severity of war.<br/><br/>Jojo (played by Roman David Griffiths) is firm advocate for the Nazis (even after an incident at a training day involving a grenade), who finds himself conflicted when it's revealed his mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl. This creates the divide of the film: during the day he does the menial work the party cannot be bothered to do themselves, and in the evenings he tries to dissect the mindset of the ""evil"" Jewish race by interrogating his houseguest. Amongst all of this, Waititi's Hitler provides the most comic relief: being imaginary, he does everything from psyching Jojo up, to eating roast unicorn.<br/><br/>Hitler is arguably the best device of the film - by being so friendly and funny, he lulls the viewer into a false sense of security, which by the end makes the audience question why they trusted this person to begin with. This gives some insight into how someone in Jojo's position could also buy into the idea of a perfect world under the Nazi party. Other notable performances come from the ever-brilliant Sam Rockwell as Captain Klezendorf, a former military man consigned to looking after children having lost an eye in the war, and Rebel Wilson as his associate Fraulein Rahm, a devout patriot who believes every rumour about the Jews is true. Jojo's best friend Yorki (Archie Yates) is harmless, but the dialogue between him and Jojo is fairly stale at times.<br/><br/>Whilst the comedy dominates the movie on the whole, serious scenes are frequent. The darkness of the Nazi party's ideology is constantly reinforced - watching Jojo speak so hatefully about another race can be tricky to watch. You also get a strong sense of the disagreement between Jojo and his mother on the benefits of the war, and how the conflict may have looked from both sides. There are some clunky elements to the storyline: Jojo's father and sister are both eluded to constantly, but neither really have any influence on the plot. It may be heavy-handed to crowbar them into the story at the end, but a lack of representation made their inclusion confusing.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is bright, using quirky costume designs and decor to make the era feel lively. Alongside this is the brilliant soundtrack: several iconic British anthems, re-recorded in German to add to the authenticity of the film. As the storyline progresses and the war draws to a close, the town itself begins to lose colour and light, using weather to foreshadow the fate of the Nazis. Whilst Jojo Rabbit doesn't really push any storytelling boundaries (as you might expect of a film with this subject matter), it does a good job of being fun and accessible. Waititi has a habit of making films appealing in this way, and I would consider this another job well done."

","Funny, engaging, tear-jerking, sweet and silly. The adults clearly relish their roles; Taika revels in his ridiculousness as imaginary Hitler and Sam Rockwell is as joyous to watch as ever. The youngsters are natural and appealing, despite (or maybe because of) some inconsistent accents. Thomasin McKenzie and Roman Griffin Davis bring real emotional weight to the whole thing. The absurdity of the adult characters serves to intensify the sucker punches of the tragic elements for the children. Important, as all Nazi stories are, but quirky, refreshing and very enjoyable."

"gwnightscream","6","0","1","5 January 2020"," Pretty Good War Comedy-Drama!
","This 2019 comedy-drama takes place during Word War II and features a young, German boy, Johannes aka Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) who wants to be a Nazi soldier. Soon, he finds a young, Jewish girl, Elsa, (Thomasin McKenzie) hidden in his house and his allegiance is tested as he gets to know her. Scarlett Johannson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson and director, Taika Waititi are also featured. This is a pretty good flick with some dramatic & humorous moments plus a great cast I recommend."
"aliceharford7","5","0","2","5 January 2020"," Strange combination of drama and comedy
","I really tried to like this film, but I couldn't. From the start, I couldn't get over the fact that it is in English. And not only English; English with a bad German accent. As a Dutch person that hurts my ears. For all you Americans out here; it probably won't be a dealbreaker.
Furthermore, the combination of drama and comedy in a WWII movie is tricky. It started off as a comedy. If they kept it that way, I might have actually enjoyed it. It really had a few funny scenes, also further on in the movie. Then the drama came. I felt the emotions were fake. They didn't bother me at all. For example, when Jojo experienced a big loss, he didn't seem to be that devastated.
Overall, it was a strange combination and it didn't speak to me."

"lizshotter","8","0","1","4 January 2020"," Beautiful reflection on today's issues
","I am an ardent fan of anyone who is prepared to hold a mirror up to racism, cruelty and persecution and harpoon these subjects with humour and ridicule. There is a rise in incidents of racism and intolerance and the president has raised the ""respectability"" of such behaviour. Jojo rabbit challenges so much of this using a gentle and absurdist satire. I know some critics think it doesn't go far enough, as in with The Producers (springtime for hitler), but I feel it does make some highly relevant points. Johanson is a joy as jojos courageous and resilient mother trying to show her son a different path than the hitler worshipping blind faith that jojo exhibits. The relationship between jojo and his best friend is incredibly sweet and touching, but it's jojos relationship with his imaginary friend hitler that is hilarious and at times difficult to watch, but provides some simple but compelling messages. It's definitely worth watching."

"movieman6-413-929510","7","0","1","27 December 2019"," With dark comedy, Taika Waititi shows how propaganda can affect a person.
","Jojo Rabbit is a new war drama comedy directed, written and partly produced by Taika Waititi, the director of Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor: Ragnarok.<br/><br/>The film is set in Germany where Adolf Hitler has the power. The young Yo-yo (Roman Griffin Davis) is raised under Nazi policies with the propaganda that Hitler and his Third Reich are the saviors of the world and that the Jewish people are responsible for the world's problems.
Jojo is a bit lonely and insecure about himself and doesn't dare too much. For this reason, he is soon nicknamed Jojo Rabbit. Because of his loneliness and his head filled with propaganda, Jojo sees an imaginary version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) as his imaginary friend who advises him how to live his life.
When Jojo discovers that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is helping a Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) go into hiding in their attic, Jojo faces a difficult choice. He can report his own mother and Jewish girl to the Nazi Board, just as his imaginary friend advises him to do, or to keep his mother's secret secret until the war is over.<br/><br/>With this film, Taika Waititi shows well how something like propaganda can make someone change his mind and then completely of young children. He does this in a way that he knows how to bring a good mix of comedy and drama. The film also has the message that you have to make your own choices in your life without the influence of someone else. The film also shows well that you don't have to judge anyone by their appearance or belief, but you first have to get to know the person before you can judge how someone actually is. Taika Waititi has also written the film in a respectful way, but still manages to ridicule Nazi ideas in a good way.<br/><br/>The film also has an appropriate film set that comes across as Germany during the Nazi regime where the walls were hung and people were walking around with propaganda to portray their leader in a positive way. The film shows so well how propaganda blinded Hitler's followers. The horrible things that happened thanks to Hitler are portrayed in a nice colorful way in the film, while it was actually about idiotic things.<br/><br/>The acting is also done well in the film. This is only the first acting work of Roman Griffin Davis and he already performs his role in a good and credible way. The other starting actor Archie Yates also plays his role well. The two young actors look nice together. Scarlett Johansson also performs well when Jojo shows his mother how her son changes her lifestyle through Nazi propaganda. Taika Waititi also does it comically as an imaginary version of Adolf Hitler."

"0w0","8","0","1","24 December 2019"," The 'Kiwi Tarantino' does it again
","A good 'comedy' to pass 1hr40mins with.<br/><br/>It's a comedy, though it's not 'hilarious' as some are claiming... I laughed once, and giggled maybe twice... so it's definitely NOT 'hilarious'... it's just a nice little comedy, with a good story thrown in (the story, btw, is very reminiscent of Inglourious Basterds).<br/><br/>Taika Waititi (the director) is starting to build up a nice resume of movies, and it certainly helps that (so far) 3 of his movie are 8/10 movies in my book, so it's CLEAR that he has talent and he's still got a long career ahead of him... I think of his as the 'Kiwi Tarantino'"
"Dan1863Sickles","6","0","3","6 December 2019"," Come Back To The Raft Again, Jo Jo Honey!
","This is a charming movie, but it's not really as insightful or original as its admirers seem to think.<br/><br/>To begin with, there are some screamingly obvious parallels with the book that was once regarded as the cornerstone of American literature, Mark Twain's THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN.<br/><br/>Jo Jo is an awful lot like Huck. He's a small boy who's been more or less abandoned by a deeply corrupt society. Left to himself, he literally stumbles across a fellow outcast -- only he's been taught to hate Jews, just the way Huck has been taught to despise black slaves. Jo Jo and Elsa have lots and lots of long talks when they're all alone together in the spooky abandoned house, just the way Huck and Jim talk when they're all alone on the big river. And gradually they become friends.<br/><br/>So far so good, and it's impossible not to enjoy the way Jo Jo and Elsa grow as characters and the amazing chemistry of the two young actors who play them. But this movie sentimentalizes the adult figures in Jo Jo's life in a way that Mark Twain would have found nauseating.<br/><br/>The Widow Douglas is the closest think Huck has to a mother. She's kind to him in her way, but she's no smarter or better than the adults around her where racial prejudice is concerned. She's a slave owner and she never pretends to see blacks as equal -- not even when she's praying with them! Now Jo Jo's mother is played by the stunning and talented Scarlett Johannsen, and the problem is that she's too good to be true. Too brave, too glamorous, too sexy, too open-minded. With a mother like that, how could Jo Jo have ever become a Nazi in the first place? There's a desperate sentimentality at work in how the mother is portrayed. Like, women can't be evil, so we'll just make the mother a ""woke"" 21st century feminist who happens to live in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The movie sidesteps other problems as well. Jo Jo is a little boy, and we're supposed to believe he only is attracted to Hitler for childish reasons. He likes the uniforms, the saluting, and stuff like that. He has no anger of his own, no resentments, no grievances, no life experience. Compare Jo Jo to Hando, the skinhead Russell Crowe plays in ROMPER STOMPER. Try to imagine what Hando would have done if he had stumbled across a girl like Elsa!<br/><br/>Now think about Elsa herself. She's got a sharp tongue and she's vividly drawn, but -- no spoiler intended -- when push comes to shove she's remarkably patient and understanding. There's a line that's quoted in a lot of reviews, ""you're ten years old, Jo Jo. Act like it."" That line puzzled me, but the point I think is that Elsa and everyone else is willing to forgive Jo Jo just because he's a kid. Forgiveness is a big part of what the movie is about, and what Elsa is about as a character.<br/><br/>But that sidesteps the question of what being hated and seeing your whole family murdered would actually do to a girl like Elsa. She's a very different character from Gabrielle/Shoshana in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. The extraordinary thing is that both characters come from the exact same historical moment, but they react to it in opposite ways. And the supreme moment of vengeance in one movie and the supreme moment of forgiveness in the other movie are both backed up by songs of David Bowie!<br/><br/>I wasn't outraged by the light tone or the positive message of Jo Jo Rabbit, but I don't think it's a profound masterpiece either. Too many of the more unpleasant questions go unanswered and Jo Jo's forgiveness comes a little too easily."
