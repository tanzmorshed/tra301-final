","For those who don't like documentaries (the documentary about Snowden, which is part of this movie, is excellent education about what our government can do with us) watch this first. Oliver Stone paints a portrait of a stand-up, pretty much button down guy who realizes the work he falls into is anything but what he was taught was right -- and then he needs to find a way out, without endangering his girlfriend. Another great film about a whistleblower --- and for his whistleblowing, he faces far harsher penalties just for coming home. Oliver Stone delivers thought provoking film again, and the entire cast, as well as the writing, is stellar.<br/><br/>For those who made up their mind about Ed Snowden through what was reported in mass media, I would simply say, watch this with an open mind. What happened to him could happen to any of us. This is a cautionary tale based on true facts told in the most exquisite way by Stone and his cast.<br/><br/>Isabeau Vollhardt, author, The Casebook of Elisha Grey"

","I don't understand people that complain about this movie. <br/><br/>There is zero to complain about in this movie. You got to wonder if the low reviews are government paid employees or just Oliver Stone haters.<br/><br/>I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I was mesmerized from the beginning of the film until the end. I honestly had no idea it ran two hours and 20 minutes. A movie is never too long if you don't look at your phone and check the time. Myself, nor did anyone in the theater once look down at their phone. The movie had great cinematography, excellent pacing, strong emotional dialogue, and solid character/relationship arcs. You can't ask for much more of a drama based on a true story. Excellent job Oliver. Welcome back! <br/><br/>The truth is people don't want to hear it. If it doesn't directly affect their cozy iPhone streaming lives, than they don't want to hear about it. They don't want to hear that they are wage slaves. They don't want to hear that there is no such thing as privacy in this country. They don't want to hear that the government isn't a democracy. People don't want to hear that the American government isn't a government at all, and that it's been replaced by a multi-national fortunate 100 corporate conglomeration funded by the international banking cartel. People don't want to know the truth.<br/><br/>I'd venture a guess that most of the people that rated this movie poorly didn't even see the movie. These are the same people that can't handle the truth. Open your eyes people. Don't be another corporate wage slave."

","Very well made movie, very well acted, and directed. <br/><br/>Going in I was worried that the movie would turn into an action thriller or a love story that would cloud what really happened.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised to find a step by step account of real events with a deep look at what goes on behind the scenes at the various spy agencies.<br/><br/>Personally I would have liked a little more time spent on the politicians (and other behind the scenes players) and how they acted before and after the Snowden revelations, but maybe that's a topic for another movie<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in modern history and geopolitics"
"Ramascreen","8","199","239","11 September 2016"," Riveting! Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance.
","The great director who's not afraid to tackle matters of war, conspiracy and controversial American political issues, has returned. Only this time, Oliver Stone has upgraded his latest film's look and tone to make it seem more digitally advanced, which is fine because it fits the story of Edward Snowden and we're living in this day and age where every millennial's favorite series happens to be ""Mr. Robot."" SNOWDEN, as you've guessed it, is a thriller about the whistleblower and former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden, played in this film by the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt. ""Divergent"" star, Shailene Woodley plays his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, who stays by his side through his ordeals of working for the government due to his patriotism while at the same time feeling conflicted about how the government runs its methods in the name of national security. This film dramatizes the events that led Snowden to becoming one of the most wanted men in the world.<br/><br/>First, I have to give praises to Joseph Gordon-Levitt who I think went above and beyond in not only capturing Edward Snowden's mannerism and the way he speaks but my goodness, Gordon-Levitt's performance in this film is so calculating and precise, you can see his brains constantly work itself out, just by looking at him. And Shailene Woodley gives her most mature performance yet, because this film is more than just about the whole surveillance controversy, it's also about how that negatively affects Snowden & Mills relationship and I think it's fairly handled, both aspects don't take away or diminish each other's importance in the process.<br/><br/>When it comes to the film's dramatizing the U.S. and British global surveillance program, I'm sure there'll be questions as to how authentic the portrayal is, as far as the headquarters are concerned, for example, some may see it as a bit too much like a Bond villain's secret lair, but you'll be entertained by some of the visual effects that the film applies to showcase hacking and how one person can connect to another person and to another person and what's most fascinating about it is that there's a programmer watching the whole thing the entire time.<br/><br/>So SNOWDEN is essentially part conspiracy thriller, part relationship drama, and to a certain extent, part heist. Overall, I think it's a riveting film that keeps you engaged and more importantly gets you thinking, which I think is the goal of Oliver Stone's movies. Does the film lean one way in that it paints Edward Snowden as a hero? I think so, but not in a way that intentionally judges those who at the end still think of him as a traitor. SNOWDEN might cause audiences to become more paranoid or it might cause audiences to start supporting any effort to hold our government accountable. The jury's still out.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"
"Anaslair","9","25","27","26 February 2017"," Outstanding character building by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - even a bigger fan now!
","I went to watch Snowden with someone who was extremely well informed about the subject while I sadly wasn't and while we had extremely different perspectives going into it, I believe it is safe to say both thought the movie was pretty darn awesome. From the former point of view, it appears some important things were left out, while I kept getting stuck on stuff like how does a guy who did not even finish high school and obviously really wants to make it in Special Forces turn out to be such a genius, only being self-taught.<br/><br/>The fact is the story enthralled me. Even if some things felt cheesy, especially the abuse of light surrounding the main character in key moments, the fact is due to such a strong issue and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's stellar performance (queue choir of angels – yes, I am biased towards this guy, sue me), this was indeed a memorable experience.<br/><br/>I mean, that guy obviously did such a brilliant character study. I cannot get past how he placed his voice. The facial expressions and ticks, the way he held himself, a lovely mixture of a fragile and strong young man with principles literally held me at the edge of my seat sometimes – I had to keep reminding myself to sit back.<br/><br/>Some things did throw me off besides what I mentioned above, such as the way he got the information out (the entire process just seemed oversimplified) – and really every single time he expressed his obviously dangerous points of view.<br/><br/>However, I had a terrific time watching this and I highly recommend it. Makes me want to watch the documentary, to find out what really happened and what is just in the movie."
"lee_eisenberg","9","86","104","2 October 2016"," there's more than meets the eye
","In June, 2013, it came out that the National Security Agency had a massive espionage network in place. Within a few days, the source of the information revealed himself. Edward Snowden was a computer professional who had been working first for the CIA, and then switched to the NSA. Before long, his conscience started bothering him, and so he downloaded evidence of the espionage network, flew to Hong Kong, and revealed it to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, while director Laura Poitras filmed the interview. Without a doubt it was the biggest story of 2013.<br/><br/>This story got told in Poitras's Oscar-winning documentary ""Citizenfour"". Oliver Stone's ""Snowden"" tells the story, but also looks at the years leading up to Snowden's employment by the NSA: his military service, his stationing in Geneva, and then Japan, and finally his employment with the NSA outlet in Hawaii.<br/><br/>I don't know if I would go so far as to call this a masterpiece, but what's mind-blowing is the sheer scope of not just the espionage network, but everything else that it comprised. Without a doubt, the most important scene is the worldwide revelation of Snowden's leaks, and Snowden's subsequent flight to Russia, where he remains to this day.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fine job as Snowden, as do Shailene Woodley as his lover Lindsay Mills. The rest of the cast includes Zachary Quinto (Spock in the ""Star Trek"" reboot) as Greenwald, Melissa Leo (Alice in ""The Fighter"") as Poitras, and an assortment of other people, including some surprise cast members.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend the movie. Even though the viewer knows the plot, it's still a suspenseful story."
"nataliejobrien","7","60","72","30 September 2016"," New perspective on Snowden
","This movie succeeds in padding out the personal dimension of the Edward Snowden story. Its focus is the impact of Snowden's highly secretive, demanding work on his home life – and particularly on his relationship with his girlfriend, Lindsay.<br/><br/>The Snowden story is so bloody interesting – which makes this film interesting, thought-provoking and definitely worth a watch. However, the script was a bit melodramatic at times and I did find myself wishing they had done a better job with the content.<br/><br/>If you're interested in Snowden generally, I would definitely recommend the documentary Citizenfour over this one. But if you've already seen it, then it's worth adding this one to your watch list."
"theoryneutral","10","121","155","13 September 2016"," Oliver Stone Served his Country
","I have to save the 10/10 for those that deserve it and this one does. <br/><br/>I saw this at the opening in Toronto and came into it with a critical eye, having seen Citizen Four and having a good knowledge of the events that unfolded throughout the story recounted in this film.<br/><br/>Understandably, some weren't sure if all the shocking events in the film actually happened in the manner they were portrayed, so it's possible the public at large will never actually know just how accurate and important this film is. It all happened. And more. A lot of content didn't make it into the film but Stone's editing choices were sound.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's faithfulness to the facts is astounding. Nothing was distorted or sacrificed for entertainment value. For a filmmaker to show this constraint is rare because it puts at risk the approval of a large portion of the audience. And it shows his true intent, even if Stone claims he was not trying to inspire activism.<br/><br/>Snowden Portrayal: Excellent acting, understated; that's Snowden.<br/><br/>Greenwald Portrayal: Brilliant acting, and sometimes I got the eerie feeling I was actually watching Greenwald, though the role was perhaps a little too emotional at times when the real Greenwald would have kept his composure. <br/><br/>On Laura Poitras actually being in the film: It was justice that Stone actually gave her character a role in the film, since Laura herself never does, and she deserves credit for what she has done. She risked her life many times over to bring us the facts in Citizen Four.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone served his country in making this film and by doing justice to the bravery of Snowden. Perhaps the world will be more inclined to care about what is taking place right in front of us once this film is available to all."
"virek213","10","115","147","20 September 2016"," SNOWDEN--Blowing The Whistle On Government Malfeasance, And Paying The Price
","By far the biggest story of U.S. government malfeasance was uncovered in 2013, when a young man named Edward Snowden leaked out to the media and the world at large that his employers at the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, besides spying on other countries, and terrorist organizations around the world, were also spying on all the electronic communications of everybody in the United States itself. These revelations made him a man without a country, and a fugitive charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 for allegedly revealing classified information that compromised the security and the lives of U.S. surveillance agents all over the world. It also made him perhaps the most dangerous whistleblower of government overreach in history, or at least since Daniel Ellsberg. And unsurprisingly, it was Oliver Stone, the director best known for his critiques of American political behavior with PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, JFK, and NIXON, who stepped into the breach of this, maybe the most important political story of our time, with SNOWDEN.<br/><br/>Based on Luke Harding's book ""The Snowden Files"" and Anatoly Kucherena's book ""Time Of The Octopus"", SNOWDEN stars Joseph Gordon-Leavitt as a young man who, both as an intellectual conservative and a patriot, worked his way up into the highest circles of the U.S. intelligence community during the first decade of the 21st century and the War On Terror, which involved less about stopping terrorism with military force but with the force of electronics and surveillance. This seems all good and fine to him, and he develops further programs to assist the intelligence communityuntil, as he looks up the data, twice as many communications have been monitored from within the U.S. itself as have been from even our most feared legitimate adversary, Russia. Much of the story is told in flashbacks and flash-forwards, as Gordon-Leavitt relates his story to documentary filmmaker Laura Poitros (Melissa Leo), journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto), and journalist Ewan MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) in a hotel in Hong Kong (later detailed by the real-life Laura Poitros in her Oscar-winning 2014 documentary CITIZENFOUR). We see how his life, especially with his girlfriend (Shailene Woodley) and his problems with epilepsy, comes unwound, and how he must go on the run after his revelations are published in the British newspaper The Guardian, which Greenwald and MacAskill worked for. He winds up at Moscow International Airport just a few days after his story hits the Internet in June 2013, and in exile, a fugitive from what passes for American justice in the 21st century.<br/><br/>Rather surprisingly, given his penchant for doing extremely controversial movies in his career, Stone was initially fairly reluctant to touch the Edward Snowden story in any way, shape, or form. But Kucherena (Snowden's real-life attorney in Russia) and Greenwald themselves convinced that it would be good for him to detail the story. Stone then agreed to do it, with Fitzgerald assisting him in the writing of the screenplay, and the result is one of the great films of 2016. Gordon-Leavitt is a near dead-ringer for the real-life Edward Snowden, who is seen at the end of the film detailing why he did what he did and why coming back to America would not result in his getting a fair trial. Although Stone had been well-known for doing films with quick-edged MTV-inspired montage sequences, including his notorious 1994 film NATURAL BORN KILLERS, he avoids doing much of that in SNOWDEN, instead concentrating on the inner workings of Snowden's work, and how much harm he may have been creating in the name of National Security, as opposed to merely keeping us ""safe"" from any more 9/11-type terrorism.<br/><br/>The subject matter that is broached by Stone in SNOWDEN, even with a relatively limited amount of violence and nudity (compared to other films of Stone's), is not easy to watch; nor is it necessarily easy to grasp in a lot of ways how the American people themselves, in the panic that followed September 11, 2001, basically acquiesced and allowed such mass surveillance to take place. Given the revelations in the early 1970s about Ellsberg's Pentagon Papers scandal, and those involving the FBI's Counterintelligence Program against anti-war protesters and civil rights activists, one might have thought that the people would have learned. But speaking truth against government power is a dangerous thing to do, and at the same time the right one; and SNOWDEN, its subject, and its maker, show it better than perhaps anyone else in Hollywood could ever do."

","I saw this movie as part of a small audience. Years ago, when the story was on the nightly news, Our USA news media had distorted the story so badly that I thought that Snowden was a spy. Now, I doubt that he was. There was a question asked of President Obama that made it clear for me. ""Do you now consider Snowden to be a spy or a whistle blower?"" I think this is a very Good movie. The small audience applauded at the end. It seems to be pretty clear that Snowden blew the whistle on ""Big Brother"". You should go to see this movie. Take some friends with you. There is very good dramatic acting. Good directing even though Oliver Stone does make it very dark. Snowden wanted to stop government spying on anyone. He would be a much better option for President than either of our current choices. I admit to being an Oliver Stone fan. His movies go into details that our news media ignores. Maybe we should try to get Snowden to come back so we can hear his version of what actually happened."

"aarondeancallaghan","9","12","13","8 August 2017"," A compelling watch that left me wanting more and more.
","Well, I'm surprised. When I went to watch 'Snowden' I cant say I was expecting much, I expected it to be average at most, boy was I wrong. From the very first scene I found myself glued to the screen with vast amounts of interesting information, facts and fantastic acting and story line all spilling out at once. <br/><br/>Some reviews I had read beforehand seemed to state that the title was a little slow moving in parts, I cannot say I agree at all. I think, personally, if you commit yourself to the film and set all electronics and distractions aside, which I do, then you will not be able to take your eyes of the screen. There is no unnecessary scenes as such, each one has reason behind it and valuable information to keep your interest for the entire two hour running time. Its hard to believe some of the software that the NSA, CIA etc have at their fingertips and its hard to believe that this movie is based of solid facts. Some scenes will leave you in shock, trust me on that one. <br/><br/>As for the acting? Oscar Worthy. I find the actors get into character very very well and all credit to the star of the show, Joesph Gordon-Levitt, he does a fantastic job playing Snowden. <br/><br/>To summarise, this was a fantastic movie, one of the best I have watched in a long time and I certainly recommend it to those who have interest in current affairs and politics etc. Now this doesn't mean its a 'strictly political film', because its not. There is a fine balance between politics, drama and pure thrillerness, excuse my made up word lol. <br/><br/>Whether or not you believe what Snowden done was Patriotic or whether you believe he is a traitor is entirely up to you. Me? Well I think the guy has a huge set of B***s to do what he done. But don't let your personal opinion get in the way of you watching this title, because trust me its worth watching. Enjoy!"

"g-55590","10","163","234","10 September 2016"," Reflection of my expectations
","Arguing about gender identity and racial issues completely misses the substance, the real issues of what happens when we let government expand it's powers under the pretext of terrorism, after a tragedy that shut down all thinking. Powered by genuine fear of terrorists created as a result of imperialistic and abusive foreign policy, the American public has ignored waste of tens of billions of tax-dollars that could've been spent on health care, infrastructure and education. Developed in secrecy, perfected on 'worthless' Muslims in Middle-East, everything from surveillance blimps to state-sponsored malware is now rapidly being deployed in homeland: US is being torn apart not just by racial issues, but by the ever increasing wealth gap, the scale of which according to a recent study, most American haven't even got a clear understanding of.<br/><br/>Privatized industry funded with tax-payer money without the *informed* consent of citizens has turned into legal theft. Snowden was part of that system, but in a unique way; He worked in a position where he saw far beyond the standard compartmentalization. He wasn't Alice developing metadata collection program. He wasn't Bob creating target automation. He wasn't Charlie building drones. He wasn't David confirming kills. He was Edward who saw NSA's SKYNET program, a real tool used to automate drone murders with surveillance metadata.<br/><br/>Saying it took guts to blow whistle on corruption within the world's largest intelligence establishment is a complete understatement.<br/><br/>While some people like Silas Davis here seem to think no large terrorist attacks must mean mass surveillance, works, The Intercept has done extensive reporting on how not only this is false, but that FBI has had to provide resources on troubled people just to get them arrested.<br/><br/>Privacy is a universal human right, but having to hand it away for the sake of security reduces it to a a mere privilege. What makes it even more ridiculous is the transparency in society has completely reversed it's state: Citizens are monitored to the point where gerrymandering strips their only power -- their vote. Meanwhile government the power of which is derived from the governed has secret court, secret laws and secret interpretations of these laws. In such situation ""I have nothing to hide"" is either badly placed trust or a coping mechanism.<br/><br/>The revelations by Snowden were made possible by decades long effort by the cypherpunk community, that has developed encryption tools from Tor-network to PGP-emails to OTR-instant messaging that Poitras, Greenwald and Snowden actually used to empower themselves during 2013. Citizenfour documentary honored these projects during credits.<br/><br/>Information security allowed by the law, and achieved with sophisticated technology is extremely important. Terrorism isn't the number one threat, cyber attacks are. The Snowden documents have revealed how NSA has injected back doors into hardware, bribed companies like RSA to use back doored random number generators, and weakened industry standards in an attempt to monitor everything. In reality they've made much easier for all cyber terrorists and foreign governments to hack vital systems that belong to government and companies, and that maintain the critical infrastructure.<br/><br/>How well the movie grasps over all this, we'll see soon. The 10 goes just for increasing the awareness. Meanwhile, I suggest the conversation be steered towards the real issues instead of feeding trolls."

"rubenm","6","40","55","5 November 2016"," Classic, clean-cut film about a fascinating subject
","Edward Snowden is one of the most fascinating Americans alive, so it's no wonder his life has been made into a movie. After the documentary Citizenfour, it's already the second film featuring the famous whistle-blower. Citizenfour focused on the days Snowden spent in a hotel room in Hong Kong, where he invited two journalists who published the news about the massive surveillance of millions of people. Oliver Stone's new film takes a different approach and shows us Snowden's back story. His life is shown in flash backs from the hotel room scenes. What made him decide to basically give up his comfortable life and spend the rest of his days in exile? Stone shows how Snowden slowly changed from a patriotic army soldier into a concerned citizen. When he and his girlfriend Lindsay discuss the war in Iraq, shortly after they have met, they disagree. He defends the war, and ridicules Lindsay's liberal views and her participation in anti-war protests. She tells him: 'America is founded on the right to question our government'. Years later, he uses those exact words to explain and defend his whistle-blowing.<br/><br/>The relationship between Snowden and his girlfriend gets relatively much attention in the film. On the one hand because a love interest is always nice for a Hollywood film, but on the other hand also because it is important for the development of Snowden's mindset. His work for the NSA influences their relationship, not only because they have to live abroad, but also because it seems even Lindsay's e-mail and online conversations are being tracked and placed under surveillance. Is this the final straw that makes him decide to take bold actions? <br/><br/>What bothered me about the film is that it is a bit too clean-cut. The intelligence agencies are full of giant screens and slick technology, there are some romantic scenes, and the film looks overall very smooth. It's a rather classic biopic, without much cinematographic added value. For a subject as controversial as the NSA-leaks, and a for a film maker with a reputation such as Stone, that's a little bit disappointing."

I can't imagine anyone ever producing a Snowden movie that is better than this one. I felt the story was presented objectively and neutrally. Only near the end did the political aspect become a little too much. Yes, Stone is taking a pro-Snowden position and is trying to convince you that his position is right. If you are unable to emotionally handle that didactic aspect, don't see this movie.<br/><br/>Can I also talk about Joseph Gordon-Levitt? The man is clearly a great actor with enormous range.

I am proud to say that Oliver Stone, of Platoon and JFK fame, delivers justice to the story; and it's one of the best movies of 2016.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays Edward Snowden. In two or three scenes; Snowden is strapped to a high tech lie detector, he is asked the question ""Is America the greatest country in the world?"" to which he replies yes. This is what drives Edward throughout the movie, as he transitions from Special Forces dropout to CIA computer analyst. He works on various assignments across the country and learns the means that the Government uses to intrude on the privacy of the American people. He also has a relationship with Lindsay Mills; who loves social media but is also affected and disturbed by Edward's paranoia and resentment towards the Government. She's also the most static character in the film, and she should've been given closure considering her real life counterpart is standing by Snowden today.<br/><br/>The ending is spectacular and delivers it's message without being overly sentimental. All the important characters are relevant and brilliantly acted by the likes of Rhys Ifans, Nicolas Cage, Tom Wilkinson, Zachary Quinto, etc. The film features excellent cinematography with good use of color schemes in various scenes to make it's universe feel like our own.<br/><br/>Snowden is a thrilling and entertaining Drama that is crucially important for people living in America today.

This story gives us good reason to think far more about our leaders and the power of current high tech surveillance. It's to be hoped Snowden's motives were as well intended and idealistically slanted towards concerns for the general populace as we are being shown. If so, I salute him and Stone for this work. <br/><br/>Interesting performances, great use of fine photographic technique and a thoughtful music score are a plus for this, at times unsettling movie. The Obama administration, as many of us knew, have much to explain and make amends for. Perhaps the reason this movie was not as popular as expected is that there have been many similarly themed works over the past several years that just may have come out too close to each other. On top of this, the dumbing down of some audiences with comic book type blockbusters never helps intelligent fare to gain strong circulation. As people learn more about these situations, I imagine this movie will benefit from more recognition. Recommended for thinking folk. Language is typical of other Stone works but the original, based on fact story, helps make up for some of it."

","""I support online rights"" – it's the sentence glued to Edward's Snowden laptop cover. Although it's only seen near to the final scene, it's the core, the driving force, the backbone of all film and Snowden real life choices. As we know, every choice come with a consequence either positive or negative. However the citizen had to be forced to go out of his birth country, he never lost his hope and motivation to show the world, the modern society that we should fight for our rights, even those which are sometimes disrespected by our own government entities. The conduction of the narration and scene sequence were very well thought, and made the general public understand every step of Snowden, and what sort of reality he needed to deal. It's also to be praised the courage and bravery that he had to put himself and his family in danger, but first of all the incredible idea of hiding a memory card in a Rubik's Cube."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","7","9","9 October 2016"," Gordon-Levitt excellent as Snowden
","One critic refers to a new subgenre when reviewing ""Snowden"" – a movie about very recent historic events. In this film, in particular, the protagonist's face is very familiar to the general public, even those who have not seen the topnotch documentary, Oscar-winner ""Citizenfour"". I have. And I have also watched most of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's major work (too many to list). Watching this talented actor's portrayal, I came to believe that I was actually watching the real Edward Snowden. At the concluding scene of the monumental Moscow interview, when the camera deftly superimposed the real Snowden while fading out Gordon-Levitt, I hardly even noticed. That is how good he is!<br/><br/>""Citizenfour"" came entirely from the camera of Laura Poitras (who never appears herself in the film, except for her voice) recording the interview Snowden had in a hotel room with two other media veterans Glenn Greenwood and Ewen MacAskill. Oliver Stone's ""Snowden"", anchoring on that interview to which he allocates less than one third of screen time, uses flashbacks to cover two other aspects of this ""astonishing"" (Ewen MacAskill's parting words) young man – career and romance. Everyone knows that the key controversy here is ""whistleblower"" vs ""traitor"". In his film, Stone is telling the story as Snowden would have liked to tell it. Personally I have no problem with that. Anybody who wishes can make another movie of Snowden, portrayed as a criminal.<br/><br/>The earliest flashback is brief, showing Snowden's grueling military training that ends abruptly with discharge due to physical disability. While he can still walk normally after an accident, landing with a parachute will definitely result in breaking his leg again. The next segments show his early CIA days where his brilliance is perceived quite differently by two mentors, both fictional characters. Right-wings to his bones, Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans, brilliant, scene-stealing) greets his class by telling them in no uncertain terms that if 911 happens again, it is their fault. He recognizes in Snowden the best student he has ever had as well as an immensely valuable asset to beefing up security. Hanks Forrester (Nicholas Cage, unimposing but scene-stealing in a different way) is fully sympathetic to this exceptionally talented young man who unfortunately, in his innocence, will eventually be disillusioned by the ruthless, unprincipled organization he is stuck with. <br/><br/>The romance story has been given considerable screen time, but handled in a low-key manner, which is the way it should be. This sequence is needed to build a three-dimensional character of the man Snowden, not just whistleblower Snowden. Even more importantly, it underscores the sacrifice Snowden has made. All he wants is a simple life with someone he loves and loves him. But on top of that, he also has affluence and lives in paradise (i.e. Hawaii). Shailene Woodley plays Lindsay Mills lovingly, a girl who clearly is nobody's fool but is also supportive when there are reasons to be. One subtext, likely unintentional, is the reflection of an ever-present dilemma that when respective careers dictate different locations for a couple, one has to concede if they want to stay together. In this story, he initially declines Hawaii because of her, but she eventually goes with him because the climate, she believes, will be helpful in his health problem (epileptic seizure). <br/><br/>While it is a gradual process for Snowden to see the ""big brother"" in CIA, it is in Hawaii where his promotion has given him access to the state-of-the-art surveillance technology that he makes that final decision to blow the whistle. Also interesting is the scene of a leisurely after-work beach barbecue gathering. A colleague, almost nonchalantly, tells how he witnessed a kid winding up being collateral damage in one of these routine surveillance operations. That immediately reminds me of the movie ""Eye in the sky"".<br/><br/>Probably recognizing that many in the audience would have seen ""Citizenfour"", director Stone wisely keeps the hotel room interview scenes low key and as faithful to the original as possible. The excellent cast helps, with Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto and Tom Wilkinson playing Poitras, Greenwald and MacAskill respectively (remember though that Poitras does not appear at all on the screen of ""Citizenfour""). ""Snowden"" is even less of a thriller than ""Citizenfour"". The only scene of acute conflict is Greenwald's confrontation, in teleconference mode, with The Guardian's editor in London, Janine Gibson, giving her an ultimatum on the time of publishing. Gibson, incidentally, is played by Joely Richardson, Vanessa Redgrave's daughter. As mentioned in the summary line, Gordon-Levitt turns in an excellent portrayal of the Edward Snowden that we have seen on screen, low-key, level-headed, passionate in an unassuming way. It is the image of the real Snowden, again as mentioned, that brings to conclusion this superb film that is not intended to inflame or shock you, but rather to ""bother"" (quoting from the critic) you, and make you think."

","Let me preface this by saying that the film cinematically was good. However, my criticisms regard the impact of the film in relation to the true events that took place, and the real Edward Snowden.<br/><br/>The main character in the movie 'Snowden' was a dishonest and grossly false representation of the real Edward Snowden. Oliver Stone portrays him as this hot shot genius big-wig within the NSA and CIA when the truth is that Edward Snowden was really a mid-level intelligence analyst. I thought that took a lot away from the real story, being that Edward Snowden was one of many ordinary government employees and what made him different is that he had the courage of his convictions to speak up and become a whistle-blower when he saw that our government was acting against the democratic principles for which this country was founded upon.<br/><br/>The real Edward Snowden shows us that even everyday Americans can become true patriotic heroes by speaking up when they see something they know is wrong. It is clear and obvious that the programs he revealed that ARE STILL BEING USED TODAY are completely prohibited by the 4th Amendment."
"eshwarmail","7","6","9","27 January 2017"," Not sure about its sincerity and authenticity, but I just enjoyed it as a well made thriller full of good performances
","Edward Snowden has had an interesting episode in his life defying the most powerful spy agency and in the process becoming both a hero and a villain depending on our view of his actions. What Oliver Stone got right is his casting and what he got wrong is that he picked a side. Considering this is a contemporary issue with an on-going raging debate about his actions, a popular movie showcasing Edward Snowden as a hero will no doubt influence the public perception whoever doesn't watch it with an open mind.<br/><br/>Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a patriotic youngster who joins the army to serve his country. When a training accident leaves him unfit for field duty, his expertise and interest in computers leads him to join the training for the virtual battleground under his mentor Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans). When he meets his liberal girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley), a section of his thought process gets unlocked leading to him questioning the actions of his agency and also himself. On the side, the sequences shown in the documentary where Snowden meets journalists and filmmakers Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo), Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) in a Hong Kong hotel unfolds in a non-linear mode; <br/><br/>There is no doubt about the weight of Snowden's revelations. Snooping on the private space of normal citizens across the world including the domestic American citizens is something that cannot be ignored. At the same time, how else does a security agency preempt an attack or a conspiracy without having options to filter between harmless and dangerous? It is a very thin line on which most of the security agencies around the world might walk in.<br/><br/>Getting Joseph Gordon-Levitt to play the titular character is job half done for Oliver Stone. Though Levitt looks already all geeky, he's hardly had an opportunity to play one and when he got one, he gives a performance par excellence. Bringing in the veterans like Leo and Wilkinson along with a proved talent like Quinto adds in the necessary depth and seriousness to the recreated documentary sequences. However the dramatization and and fictionalization might have gone a little too far when showing the entire NSA personnel having a very callous attitude towards private data of citizens which could not be true.<br/><br/>All the performances were excellent and especially enjoyed a very restrained performance by Nicolas Cage after such a long time. The background score adds to the thrill in some scenes and the screenplay is good in parts. However the runtime might be a little too long for a story which most knows how it ends. The bias is clearly visible when Snowden is shown as a hero and it could evoke some passionate discussions and debates from opinionistic viewers which is good for the movie.<br/><br/>Not sure about its sincerity and authenticity, but I just enjoyed it as a well made thriller full of good performances."

Shailene Woodley adds a very emotional and personal touch to Snowden's complicated ordeal and is a great supporting actor in this role.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone manages to stay true to the accounts and tells the story of what goes on in the CIA and NSA and hopes to open our eyes and start questioning our governments in regards to our personal privacy and existence. <br/><br/>Highly recommended. 9/10"
"CinematicInceptions","8","13","26","16 September 2016"," Story of a modern day hero. Engaging even if it gets slow at points.
","This might be the first time that I have actually rooted for the protagonist of a biopic. His conflict has an emotional appeal to it that is rarely found in a factually based movie. I think the reason for this is how active of a protagonist/person he is. Often, historical movies are based around events and have somewhat flat characters. There are exceptions to this, and Snowden does much better than most in this regard. But what sets it apart is that the majorly historical press release was solely precipitated by Edward Snowden himself and wasn't influenced by any outside tragedy.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than the back half because it's more emotional and alive, whereas the second half is a little more weighed down with showing Snowden enacting his plan. I won't fault anyone on this. Historical movies will inevitably be limited by having to show certain things to remain accurate. Regardless, I enjoyed the more organic scenes in the first half that dealt more with Snowden realizing how the government was abusing the information available to them.<br/><br/>The characters were done very well. They all felt like real people and were easy to keep track of. I don't know if the portrayals were accurate to the real people they were modeled off of, but all are given respect and proper relevance to the plot. Shaline Woodley's character Lindsay probably came off the worst, but still wasn't that bad. I may not have liked her that much, but I cared about what she meant to Edward which is good. A major reason that many people don't act the way Snowden did is because they don't want to endanger their personal life, so it was important that we saw how much she meant to Edward so that his conflict felt more real. The villain character (Rhys Ifran) may not have been the most accurate portrayal, especially since the real person he represented probably wasn't that willing to give information to people who were going to make a bad guy out of him. However, I liked the arguments that he provided to challenge Snowden with. It's a lot like the argument of the Church in Spotlight: the U.S. does a lot of good and is a beacon of hope for many people, so we should keep it that way. It's a valid point, but it's not enough to overpower the abuses that we see through Snowden's eyes and the wrongs done to people.<br/><br/>The acting is decently impressive from all sides. I wouldn't be surprised if any of the actors get Oscar nominations, but I don't think any of them will win. The script is solid with dialogue that feels realistic and scenes that are purposeful and engaging. Also, you can get the gist of what each conversation is about without needing to know all of the computer-hacker jargon that is used in them. It felt pretty well shot and edited with a slightly Danny Boyle feel to it.<br/><br/>I recommend this as an adult film. There isn't that much mature content in it, but it's not the sort of movie that you'd go to with a bunch of friends. I will warn that there are a few political jabs that aren't too subtle. Obama and Bush get trashed a bit; not too badly, but enough to make people mad. There was also a line near the end where Snowden says something about ""a leader coming along someday"" and I heard someone in the audience whisper something about it being aimed at the Donald Trump campaign. It bears lots of similarities to some of the more acclaimed historically-based movies of the past few years like Spotlight, The Imitation Game, and The Big Short to a lesser extent. It's a great movie to see, but you have to be paying a moderate amount of attention the whole time and not get distracted. It's not the #1 bio-pic, but it's definitely better than most. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."

","The wonderful: It is enjoyable drama - we connect with the characters and understand their dilemmas. Oliver Stone transformed a dry/robotic stream of data coding,data mining, and complex computing story into a story webbed with human sentiment. It was an informative film. But it's not a surprise that our world has to go off-limits in the subject of surveillance...<br/><br/>The Acting? Great! I loved Rhys Ifans performance! Such mystery and paradoxical cold warmth, fabulous! I also loved Eastwood's fresh role, and the irreverence of Nicolas Cage. Shailene plays a spontaneous and emotionally charged photographer in conflict with Snowden's job's secrecy (favorite scenes? Hawaii and Japan). Joseph Gordon's performance is authentic and heartfelt. Despite his computer focus, he pours out his emotions during moments of revelation and interaction with his girlfriend. We learn of Snowden's vulnerabilities and the worries that drove him to exit the system he was in.<br/><br/>the not-so-good: Minimal action though. Not much of a thriller either. Multi-layered complex (three levels of story: Snowden's personal life, his job and challenges, and the telling-to-the press) and slow plot. Is our protagonist a criminal or martyr? hero or anti-hero? it's a story with ambiguity. Perhaps this is what makes it s good story? Snowden had to approve this story. In conclusion, is a ""matter-of-fact"" biographical drama, but I guess it couldn't really be a different way.<br/><br/>the take-away: We learn about the human side of a computer hacking story that shook the Nation. It does raise awareness. Because of the dangerous threats to humanity, surveillance is everywhere. I had the opportunity to watch the live satellite interview between Oliver Stone, the actors, and Snowden. Stone wanted to dramatize Snowden's life experience and the circumstances that drove to do what he did, ""you take out what you want"" he said about the message of the film. The issue here was one individual's conflicted and growing mistrust of the global surveillance and breaching of people's privacy. But as the CIA official (Rhys Ifans) said it at the beginning of the film: is a trade-off between privacy and security. It's true we want privacy, but it's true we want a safe world free of the constant terrorist threat. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Its thought provoking. Perhaps, one day Snowden will use all his amazing talent to help humanity fight the great evil of terrorism. This film reminds me of the Tom Hanks/DiCaprio/Spielberg film: ""Catch me if you Can"" <br/><br/>Go and watch it in goodwill.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

You probably will see their username on movies like JFK or Nixon or the doors or something saying he expanded the truth and over dramatized the story. This film literally says at the beginning that it is over dramatized. That's why this is a Hollywood movie and not a documentary. People say Snowden himself would be ashamed of this movie oh really that's why he met with Joseph Gordon's-Levitt in person. That's why on his Twitter he is promoting the film and even using it as a reference. Wherever you agree with what he did or not this movie is with watching it gives you a first hand perception of what was going on in his head. The whole point of him revealing this info was to let the propel know and decide if it was wrong he believed the people should be fully aware and if they don't like it use the power of the people (John Lennon) to stop it. The movie is well done without getting too technical or computer terminology and just giving you the information and the story. Yes there is some expanded truth and overdramatazation but it still is a good movie and I recommend seeing it."

"gregsrants","6","17","40","11 September 2016"," Overlong
","Oliver Stone has not been relevant for some time. The three time Oscar winner owned the 80's. Salvador, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Talk Radio and Wall Street were some of the best the decade had to offer and cemented his name in film history. But by 1997's U-Turn., Stone had lost his magic. His next few films, Any Given Sunday, World Trade Center, Alexander and W. were critical bombs where overlong running times seemed to only further pat the directors own back with self-indulgence. And his last two films, Savage and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps were hardly anchors in what will eventually be a career DVD boxset.<br/><br/>Yet, when word began circulating that Stone was circling Snowden as his next film, many couldn't think of a director who would be better for the job. Based on the true events of former NSA/CIA employee Edward Snowden who became the center of equal praise and angst when he leaked thousands of classified documents to the press detailing the illegal surveillance tactics of the agencies, Stone attempts to tell the story of how Snowden eventually came to the crossroads in his life that lead him to be labelled as one of the biggest traitors in US history.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Snowden and his voice and mannerisms seem to capture the real life character to a tee. Stone based the biopic espionage thriller on books by Luke Harding and Anatoly Kucherena and switches back and forth in time between his revealing interview with Guardian reporters in 2013 to Snowden's attempts to join the military which was thwarted due to a degenerative leg injury. Snowden quickly goes from the hospital bed to the CIA and uses his cockiness and his innate ability to write code and interpret data.<br/><br/>Under the wing of protégé Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans), Snowden quickly gets fast tracked through the ranks and travels the world in efforts of National Security. Along the way, Snowdwn meets Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) who will become his female companion traveling the globe to stand by her man even as she is kept in the dark as to exactly the job description to which Snowden is fulfilling.<br/><br/>The film's pulse pounding moment comes when Snowden attempts to copy and extract from the secure intelligence facility, the files that when published showed to the world how surveillance works outside the confines of both US and International Law for benefits that could never be accounted. Even with the result never in doubt, Stone is able to lay the groundwork for some tense moments leading to Snowden's escape.<br/><br/>This marks the second film in as many years where actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a real life character following his role as Phillippe Petit in Robert Zemeckis' under-appreciated The Walk. But this also marks the second time Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a real life character in movie that is inferior to the documentaries that threw both stories into the spotlight. Both Man on a Wire and last year's Oscar winner for documentary best picture, Citizenfour, were superior films than their dramatized big budget adaptations.<br/><br/>Yet neither is the fault of the young former 3rd Rock from the Sun actor. Snowden collapses on the shoulders of director Stone who doesn't seem to care how long his films run on. Snowden clocks in at 134 minutes and it feels every bit as long as the time suggests. Watching Snowden switch from job to job/country to country is downright hard on the tushy as it is neither interesting enough to keep audiences on the edge of the seats nor important enough to keep us comfortable in the effort. Instead, the film runs out of gas long before Snowden finally determines that the information to which he is responsible must be revealed for the world to judge on merit.<br/><br/>It is an opportunity lost. Laura Poitras' Citizenfour was far superior and clearer in its description of the facts. Stone's Snowden seems muddled in the director's inability to cut entire scenes in the editing room.<br/><br/>And while most of the cast does a comparable job with little to actually do (including Melissa Leo, Zachery Quinto and Tom Wilkinson), Ifans and a role given to straight-to-video artist Nicholas Cage seem miscast. Woodley is good as the love interest and life partner, but is overused and we can't but think her continued screen time was Stone's attempt at giving the female audience members something in which to relate.<br/><br/>So Snowden doesn't exactly make Oliver Stone relevant again. Nor do we think the film will ignite another firestorm over the merits of Snowden's efforts. Instead, it is a mildly interesting film that bores audiences lulling them into a hopeless want for the dates on the screen to catch up with real time."
"gcarpiceci-73268","4","21","52","3 November 2016"," Such a wasted opportunity...
","Now, if one puts together Oliver Stone and a subject like global cyber-surveillance the minimum you would expect is an explosive outcome, a rallying cry for civil liberties, a raging attack to the global powers. The potential offered by the combination was huge, hence my high expectations; I have regularly disagreed with Mr Stone's points of view but I always liked the intellectual challenge....instead what you get from Snowden is a glossy, soft, ordinary espionage thriller, with attached love story. The potential opportunity has been totally diluted and lost, it ends being neither informative nor entertaining, just a bland, conventional movie."
"socrates99","9","6","11","22 January 2017"," Obama should have pardoned Snowden on our behalf
","I'm so sorry I didn't make the time to see it while it was playing in theaters. I suppose I shied away from being any more jacked up about our intelligence communities than I already was. But now with the election behind us and with the possibility of Snowden being pardoned having just passed, I could summon up the courage to see a work of political art that might send me into a deep depression.<br/><br/>I'm not depressed having seen it now, but I am incensed. Perhaps there's been some poetic license taken but I've no doubt it's minor and beside the point. The argument is well made that Washington has gone too far and that Snowden's acts were more than warranted. The best analogy I can think of for the core issue is a father wanting to keep his daughter safe by locking her in her room. Does it work? Yes. But should any red- blooded American girl allow it? No. It's tantamount to a denial of her fundamental right to a life of her own making. Oliver Stone has given expression to the millions of progressives who have applauded the supposedly treasonous acts of Edward Snowden and in a lot of ways this is his greatest career accomplishment yet.<br/><br/>As a movie, the first half is fairly miraculous given the technical nature of the action. Nevertheless, what is going on is made elegantly and unmistakably clear by a score of brilliantly constructed scenes. And every established actor, and there are quite a few, seems further elevated by their inclusion in this politically risky, but near heroic, work. The second half is less impressive, but that's mostly because of the real-life, mindless acts of our elected and appointed officials.<br/><br/>If there's a bad side to all this, it does shed an unfavorable, but accurate, light on Obama's administration, and there's little appetite for that given our recent election."
"trublu215","4","29","77","14 September 2016"," A cold and rather banal addition to Oliver Stone's filmography.
","Snowden tells the story we already know so much about and yet, the film treats it as if we know nothing. Oliver Stone's latest political protest of a film results in a ridiculously boring and rather banal addition to his once colorful but now lackluster filmography. The film starts by introducing exactly who Edward Snowden really is. He is a solider, a genius, and someone who, very much so, cares about his country. He is eventually hired by the NSA and the rest is history. First off, the film does nothing for Snowden other than paint him as more a patriot than anything. All personal opinions of the man aside, I'm strictly judging the character in the film. Even then, this film paints him as more a patriot than Clint Eastwood did for Chris Kyle. It becomes ham-fisted in its delivery and ends up really making for a cold film especially after what happens to him. Rather than going into what makes this film the way it is, I'll put it very simply: the film is not very good. The film is not good as a biopic and it is even worse as a political thriller. What starts off as possibly giving us, at the very least, an entertaining neo-political thriller it quickly turns into an assault on the US government. Again, I'm far from willing to interject a personal opinion in this but my opinion on the film is that it feels as though Oliver Stone wanted to make an anti-political propaganda film that is dressed up like a thriller. That is exactly what you will get when seeing this film. It does nothing in the way of expanding dramatically on the far superior CitizenFour and it does nothing to keep you engaged as the runtime slowly ticks by, giving nothing to the audience in the way of the audacious film that we deserve on such a hot button subject matter such as Edward Snowden. Now, with that being said, there is some good in the film. The performances here I found to be quite solid. Shailene Woodley gives a very good performance as Lindsay Mills, Edward Snowden's curious and worrisome girlfriend. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a fine performance as Snowden but more so nails down his voice rather than his look and mannerisms, both of which came off as parody- esque to me. The supporting cast is filled to the brim here, starring Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Rhys Ifans and Nicholas Cage to name a few. Each of the supporting cast members give their best with what they're dealt with. Cage is also a very good (and very brief) side actor that almost steals the film, not because he is particularly ground breaking in the film but because it is Nicholas Cage. If anything, it felt distracting but I didn't mind with all things considering. By the time the film ended, it left me with nothing more than the feeling of being watched. It won't let you feel the drama or the weight of it all, it will leave you beaten down in the worst way because it feels like the equivalent of two people having a heated political debate in ear shot of you and all you want to do is tell them to ""shut the f- up"". Overall, Snowden is a lop-sided political thriller wearing its agenda on its sleeve, reeking of the very idea that Oliver Stone never had the best interests of the film at heart. If you are a hardcore fan of Oliver Stone or if you have never seen Citizenfour then Snowden might be a safe bet for you, otherwise, this is merely a rental at best."

","The acting performances were skilled. I do not agree that this was well directed. The cinematography was flawed at best and continuity issues ran rampant. A few scenes left one thinking Stone was either asleep at the wheel or not present in post production.<br/><br/>There's more than one view about Ed Snowden and his actions while working for US intelligence. Stone not only portrays only one view but offers no detail about alternative opinions or possibilities. <br/><br/>The simple alternative labels Snowden a traitor. Stone fails to explore this. The assembly order of the ""facts"" leaves the viewer with little to work with other than Snowden's version of events and Stones biased portrayal.<br/><br/>Given the release date of this movie, Stone had the opportunity to explore more recent findings that Snowden is now in league with Russia and handsomely under their employ. Although treason need not be at play, the principal of inevitable disclosure represents a compromise to both the NSA and CIA. How this can occur, the effect on US National security is far more compelling than the simpleton's portrayal of a hacker patriot whistle blower.<br/><br/>I know it's too much to expect Oliver Stone would deliver a balanced perspective. In this case, the ax he's grinding is as dull as he."

","Some of these reviews are moronic. Very moronic. Snowden was a white male. Why would you cast anything else? If our culture is becoming so moronic, there is no critical thought left. Let's all just watch Adam Sandler movies and call this history lessons! This movie will play out better on DVD or at home because you can really look within. There was a lot of Mr Robot hangover (put tape over your laptop lens). We see the manifestation of what is becoming the best quote to summarize human nature; you can get someone to understand something when their career depends upon them not understanding.<br/><br/>This sums up almost everything that is organized. People turn the other way to serve their selfish needs because most people are cowards. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is easily one of our most underrated actors. He was excellent in this portrayal. Yes, it was a slow burner, but he did not overact. That is much harder to do. Oliver Stone did his homework and did a fabulous job here.<br/><br/>How many of us have the courage and integrity to count the cost of standing up against our peers? Most cannot even think of the logical consequences if the NSA had their free will. This movie is very relevant in this political age, almost to the point of ignoring the reality. We are the 'frog in water' and cannot react to corruption because it is common place. No attention span to react before the next blunder and it all melts into one depraved pot. But there will always be consequences. Always.<br/><br/>If Snowden was righteous, he will be one of the great personalities of our generation. Usually, it takes a generation to recognize those who where a step ahead of the learning curve. Snowden just might be that man."

","What happens when someone reveals 1000's of classified documents to the public and even congressional leaders who were unaware of the information? They are charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 along with other charges of theft and conspiracy. It didn't only happen to Edward Snowden. The same fate befell Daniel Ellsberg 40 years before Edward Snowden risked everything to ensure the United States citizenry had ample information to make decisions about its leadership. Ellsberg released to the press the so-called ""Pentagon Papers"" which demonstrated the widespread failure of the Vietnam War. High-level military and CIA officials not to mention the Johnson Administration wanted the public shielded from the gross mishandling and immoral objectives of the war. Of course, if the public knew, they would be appalled and they were.<br/><br/>Forty years later, computer genius Edward Snowden released to the public, both national and international, that the National Security Administration (NSA) was literally engaged in digital wiretapping of Americans. Certainly, if a known suspect was engaging in suspicious activities and the NSA and CIA wanted to spy on him to determine if he or she posed a threat, surveillance of this sort seems the appropriate response. However, supposedly in the interest of national security, the NSA decided to cast a huge net. While hunting for sharks, they ended up catching lots of harmless minnows, tuna, sun fish and blue gills. And all the fish were stored into large digital databases which can retrieved at any moment.<br/><br/>In ""Snowden"" directed by Oliver Stone, Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Ed Snowden, bona fide computer wizard and eventual US whistle-blower. The film traces his early years in the military to applying for a job in the CIA. According to the film, he is at first a right-leaning conservative who approves of the War in Iraq hosted by the Bush-Cheney administration. His talents are noticed by those in the CIA, and he is awarded high-level tech jobs at the agency.<br/><br/>His first stint is in Geneva, Switzerland where he learns about the CIA's dirty tricks to compel powerful civilians from other countries to disclose classified information. He learns about how the CIA is keeping tabs on millions of people, particularly those connected to the upper-reaches of political power. He is shown a set-up of a powerful banker out of Pakistan whose clients include billionaires from Saudi Arabia and Russia. First, they deport one of his daughters from the US. Phase two is to put the banker into a compromising position so it will seem he was driving drunk. The CIA hopes he will ""cut a deal"" with the US to avoid drunk driving charges. When Snowden sees these events, he resigns from the CIA.<br/><br/>He eventually becomes a civilian contractor for the NSA and ends up straight in the heart of a surveillance program of epic proportions. The NSA, despite testifying to the contrary, has developed a program in which all emails and cell phone calls are tapped by the government. Not just the baddies but everyone in the world including Americans. In fact, the US is tapping into American citizens more than anyone else. He learns that in one month alone, the NSA tapped into 3.5 billion phone calls and emails. Will he be able to deal with this knowledge and simply do as he's told or will he have to let the world know about what's occurring? <br/><br/>A brilliant film which asks the question: should governments be able to engage in any activity they desire without the consent of the governed? Even President Obama, who had every opportunity to arrest the program, allows the program to continue. Why? Because of supposedly the threat of national security at the hands of terrorists. And yet, according to the film, the threat of terrorism is minimal and the US government desires world domination in markets and other areas of international politics. Is this democratic or totalitarianism?"
"SteveMierzejewski","8","3","5","24 January 2017"," Stone's Snowden is Rock Solid
","I was never interested in seeing this film. This may seem surprising as I spend much of my time investigating cybersecurity. However, I had my reasons for this. First of all, I had already watched Citizenfour, the documentary on the Snowden incident. I found it mildly interesting but not compelling. Why would I want to watch a Hollywood production on the same topic? Secondly, I was suspicious about a film created by Oliver Stone. Stone seems to have an agenda that is too visible in many of his films. He's not as bad as the pseudo-documentarian, Michael Moore, but I was worried that I would get too much of Stone and too little of Snowden. Finally, why would I want to watch a movie for which I already knew the ending? I call this the 'zen of movie watching"". This is a movie you watch to enjoy the process rather than the conclusion. It can usually only be pulled off by a well-constructed movie. Death of a Salesman, for example, tells you the ending in the title. The play (or movie) shows you what events led to that final moment. Would I really be interested in seeing how Snowden ended up in Moscow, especially since I already knew the story? To get right to the point, my doubts were not justified. This was a good film. It is not simply the events shown in the documentary but more the story behind the story. The film's success largely rests on the performance of the lead actor's portrayal of Snowden. In this regard, the often under-rated, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, does a remarkable job. It has been reported that even Snowden's family praised the similarities between Gordon-Levitt's portrayal and Snowden, himself. Gordon-Levitt claimed that he repeatedly listened to Snowden's speech patterns in Citizenfour so as to get them correct. Whatever; he managed to bring the Snowden character to life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the acting of Shailene Woodley, who played Snowden's romantic interest, Lindsay Mills. For the life of me, I could not fathom how Snowden could become so interested in such a two-dimensional woman. It was difficult to see any on-screen chemistry between the two and Woodley's stilted, robotic performance didn't help matters any. I kept hoping he would dump her and get on with his life, but, sadly, she kept interrupting the flow of the film. I can only assume that the real Lindsay Mills was much more charismatic.<br/><br/>In contrast, the relationships between Snowden and his superiors and colleagues is quite well done. This and Snowden's battle with his own conscience make for the most compelling elements of the film. Stone may have an agenda, but he also shows both sides of the security vs. privacy debate. If he did not, we would never fully understand the dilemma that Snowden was cast into. It is this, and not the romantic relationship, that kept me interested throughout the film.<br/><br/>For the average, cybersecurity-naiive viewer, much of what you see will be eye-opening. I'm sure many will not believe that what they see is true, but be assured it is. Most of all, this was an unexpectedly entertaining movie which I think most people will enjoy. I especially liked the extra touch at the end, which I will not reveal in this review."

","**Disclaimer - I'm not what you could consider a 'movie buff' at all so this is solely based on my non-professional opinions.<br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way - it was an enjoyable film to watch. I was glad to learn more about who Snowden was, what he did, and a bit of why he did it.<br/><br/>However, I felt like I was left with far, far more questions than any type of answer after I watched this movie.<br/><br/>It did not really comfortably fit into any genre, I found, and while it had a lot of documentary-like elements, it tried too hard to be a drama movie at the same time. These elements were poorly done, in my opinion. The scenes meant to generate tension generated, for me, next to none.<br/><br/>I also felt that it was longer than it needed to be. It could easily have been ten minutes shorter simply through eliminating needless panoramic/extended shots that panned across the characters' faces.<br/><br/>Regardless of all the above, if you've not watched any other movies on Snowden, I'd recommend giving this a watch. However, I wouldn't find it a movie to rush to a theatre to see."

","Great actors, great cinematography, great set design, great script, great direction, fascinating and meaningful story line.<br/><br/>This movie was a heck of a lot better than I ever expected from Oliver Stone. To be honest, I was super disappointed with his film JFK, both because it came off confusing and complex while at the same time (I felt) left out important information and included what was probably misinformation. But then again, that was a really, really tough story to take on. Still, I could barely sit through it.<br/><br/>Not so with this story. This time Oliver knows the story from the horse's mouth -- Snowden himself. In addition, Edward Snowden appears to have revealed aspects of his story that to my knowledge have heretofore not come out. I did not expect to learn so much more about his reasons for becoming a whistleblower (as they seemed always so obvious), but some surprises in the film showed me how he surely felt compelled to a degree I never imagined.<br/><br/>What can I tell you about this movie beyond that? I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say too much more, except to say this is the only movie I have ever watched in my entire life at the movie theater and then felt compelled to go watch it again before it leaves town. In this film Stone did not make it too complex. Complexities are revealed without causing confusion. I can DIGEST this film. However, when I get surprised my mind tends to lapse into a stunned mode, and for this reason I feel sure I missed some delectable tidbits while savoring such surprises, and I don't want to miss a thing.<br/><br/>In my town I am very sorry to see that only two theaters even carried the film. It has already quit playing where I saw it a few days ago, and I will be seeing it on its last day in the other other place in town that is showing it, and this is Austin, Texas where we usually have ""everything.""

"CANpatbuck3664","8","6","14","2 October 2016"," Snowden is far From Impartial but Its a Riveting Story With Stellar Performances
","Edward Snowden was a person who made the world stand still and take notice when he came forward with what he smuggled out of covert U.S. government facilities. I'm not intimately familiar with Edward Snowden or his case. I feel bad about it, I should have paid closer attention but unfortunately I didn't. I'm familiar with some of Oliver Stone's previous movies, some I liked and some I didn't so I walked in without bias. I honestly don't want to talk politics (even though the movie is obviously pro-Snowden there's a lot of Obama bashing so there's something for everyone?) but I can say that this movie is informative for the uninitiated, there's some exceptional acting and even though it can get heavy-handed, it helps you understand why Snowden acted the way he did.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* A filmmaker named Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) and a reporter from the Guardian Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) wait for Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in a busy Hong Kong mall. They're nervous because he's late but he eventually shows. They head to his motel and place their phones in the microwave (for reasons I didn't catch it blocks their ability to be tracked). They're there to interview Edward who is about to leak the data that he was able to steal from the U.S. government. It focuses on the monitoring of their own citizens, how easily the can obtain this information without proper legal channels and how far the reach of agencies like the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. extends. Edward is doing his best to be careful. Glenn is more eager to get to the more key points of Ed's story but Laura encourages him to tell the whole thing.<br/><br/>Ed's story begins in 2003 (the present in the movie is 2013) when he is training to be special forces. He's already undersized and has a hard time meeting the physical requirements. In a freak accident, he falls out of his bunk bed in the barracks and his legs give out. He's required to complete physical therapy but he's told that the chances he can be a soldier are nil. While he's rehabbing he meets Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) through an internet chat room. They meet up in D.C. and despite them falling on different sides of the political spectrum, they fall in love. This is also the point that Edward decides to join the C.I.A.. He doesn't really meet the criteria being a high school dropout but his interviewer Corbin O'Brien (Rhys Ifans) sees genius in him and brings him aboard.<br/><br/>I think the most commendable thing that Snowden does it that it shows Edward as not just a hero but as a realistic person. When he joins the C.I.A. he's a die-hard Republican. He believes in the authority of the government. He begins to change with every different stop he makes serving his country and his mindset evolves instead of just flipping a switch. Edward functions as the audience avatar and through him we understand what's going on in a more complete way. He's not always a boy scout, he's possessive of Lindsay and while she's willing to change for him, he won't do it for her. He goes along with shady operations at different points as well. So while the movie absolutely paints him as a hero and a patriot, he's not a saint and I always find morally grey main characters easier to follow.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked about Snowden is that while it's obviously trying to setup Joseph Gordon-Levitt for an Oscar, there's a lot of good character actors in small parts. The acting all around is outstanding with one exception. Joseph is great here and it's one of the best performances I've seen this year. I haven't been a big fan of Shailene Woodley (she seems to be in the shadow of other actresses) but I felt like this was easily her best work. I liked the fact that they had really solid actors like Rhys Ifans, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Timothy Olyphant Tom Wilkinson and Nicolas Cage in smaller but important roles. They were all strong in Snowden. I would quickly note I thought Scott Eastwood was miscast. He's pretty wooden and it's hard to buy him as a tech genius.<br/><br/>I think that Snowden is also well filmed and well paced. The story has a nice framing device in that you get pieces of Snowden's life and then you flash to the present. If I had a complaint it's that Oliver Stone really likes to stick the visual effects in where they might not be needed. I had the same problem with Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. They also repeat themselves sometimes about how real patriots don't blindly follow what the government says. There's a lot of good discussion about it but I don't need the same points driven home many different times, I'm paying attention and you can just trust the material to get itself across.<br/><br/>It's important to keep in mind that this is a dramatization and not a documentary. The movie isn't objective, Stone doesn't disguise whose side he's on and if you feel like Snowden is a traitor, you'll probably hate Snowden. I feel like this movie will play better for people who know little about the drama surrounding Edward Snowden. I thought this was not only an enlightening look into the ethics surrounding the role of government in the everyday lives of citizens in terms of security but a pretty good spy movie to boot. I feel like the truth wouldn't be this black and white and I still don't know the whole story but I will commend Edward Snowden for being brave, giving up what he did to get the message out and I feel it's important to protect the rights of whistle-blowers. This is a well-rounded biopic and an interesting story. As long as you're not vehemently against Snowden, I would absolutely recommend this."

It's a story of the emotional struggles Snowden went through, including his relationship with his wife, his personal moral conflicts regarding the doings of the NSA and other government agencies and how his opinion on his country and government shifts over time.<br/><br/>The acting, both by Gordon-Lewitt and the supporting cast, is on point and I was particularly impressed with Nicolas Cage in the role of Hank Forrester, as I am not someone who is too fond of Cage's works.<br/><br/>The film delivers a very interesting insight into what happens behind the scenes and how frequently rules are broken by the government without the masses having any idea. It very accurately portrays the struggles Snowden faced during his time at the NSA and CIA and how the secret world he worked in made his relationship with his wife deteriorate. <br/><br/>In short, this is certainly a film worth watching if you want to see the story behind the whistleblower from his own eyes and marvel once more at the doings of the government that happen without us knowing.<br/><br/>7.8/10(8)"

","Oliver Stone has made a number of biographical dramas over the years, bringing us films such as The Doors, Nixon and W., as well as dramas based on events in American history such as JFK and World Trade Centre. With Snowden, Stone tells the story of one of the biggest National Security leaks in American history.<br/><br/>Stone's film chronicles the life of Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), from when he joined the CIA in 2004 up until 2013, when he leaked classified information regarding the illegal surveillance of American citizens to journalists working for The Guardian newspaper.<br/><br/>Snowden struggles with the morality of techniques he's asked to deploy while working for both the CIA and NSA, while also struggling to juggle those pressures with maintaining a stable relationship with Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley).<br/><br/>Snowden is by no means a bad film but I just couldn't help but feel that it should have been better. This is a film about one of the most important government leaks of all time but the film almost feels as if it's trying to play it all down. <br/><br/>I think it's the pacing and the similarity between a lot of the scenes in the film that make it drag a little when it would have worked so much better as a fast-paced drama filled with urgency. The film works best when we see Snowden and the three journalists holed-up inside a Hong Kong hotel room discussing how they can get the story out before they're found by the American government, but we don't get enough of that.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Snowden possesses a very good lead in Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's one of my favourite actors and it's so good to see him to continue to work with some of the biggest directors. Shailene Woodley heads the supporting cast as Snowden's love interest Lindsay and she does a fine job but my favourite supporting cast member was Zachary Quinto as Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists Snowden meets with, which is probably why I wanted there to be more scenes in that hotel room.<br/><br/>One of the worst decisions made by Oliver Stone was to have Edward Snowden himself appear in the film right at the very end. Sure, have photos and clips of him during the end credits but when Gordon-Levitt has played the man for 99% of the film, it just took me out of the film a fair bit. It didn't really fit for me.<br/><br/>Snowden rather feels like a bit of a missed opportunity when I think about it. It just felt all too Hollywood."

We see Edward meet his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills (Woodley), and we also see them struggle through a hard relationship (which was mostly due to the troubles of his job). We see the conservative computer professional join the CIA, while profoundly loving his country, and then feel deeply betrayed by it. We then (of course) see him leak classified information, from the NSA, and distribute it to the press; becoming one of the world's most wanted (and admired) men.<br/><br/>The film gives some great insight into the life of one of the most respected, and hated, political figures in U.S. history. I, for one, think he's a hero; and I enjoyed learning more about him. The performances are all good (especially Gordon-Levitt and Woodley), and the movie is always fascinating to watch. It does feel a little unbalanced though, and I was hoping for just a little more emotional depth; the setup is definitely there for it.

","For those of you who follow the news, Edward Snowden will need no introduction. For those of you who don't follow the news, Snowden is either a traitor who committed treason, or a whistle blowing hero who awakened the world to global cyber spying. The movie is Snowden's story. It begins when he was training to be a Special Forces soldier and was forced to quit due to a life altering leg injury. Still very much a patriot, Snowden joins the CIA. A computer genius, he helps to develop programs with disturbing consequences. Disenfranchised, Snowden leaves the CIA and gets involved with the NSA. In time, he steals classified material and flees initially to Hong Kong where he contacts journalists (See the film Citizen Four). He later ends up in Russia where he was give political asylum.<br/><br/>I think the story of Snowden is one of the most important films of this era and people should be discussing the implications of cyber spying. People need to know that Snowden is a patriot of the United States and he did what he did because he loves his country and the people in it. By becoming a whistle-blower, Snowden lost everything including his country. For him and me, spying on people is not okay; I don't care how it is justified. It is a small step from knowing what everyone is doing every minute of the day, to complete global fascism which Nazi Germany could easily have achieved.

","This movie is not bad per se. I actually wasn't sure if I would give it a 5/10 or 6/10. I landed on 5/10 for one reason.<br/><br/>And that is the story and pacing. This is an amazing story to work with, I believe this story could have been made into a very tense and exhilarating movie. Not just the fact that bringing out these documents was dangerous but also the fact that you are watching someone doing this for the American people and their right to know. I wouldn't say that this movie fumbled the story completely. But I firmly believe this movie was three quarters of an hour too long. This movie would have been 10 time more exciting and 10 times more interesting if it had been shorter. At certain times I was just losing my interest, and that is unforgivable in a movie like this. This topic actually interests me deeply, yet the movie couldn't always keep my attention. Sometimes it glossed over certain parts and went deeply into things that arn't at all that interesting. The pacing was off, and that really screwed with the storyline and the interest of the viewer.<br/><br/>Everything else about this movie was fine, but not extraordinary. The acting was good, I like Joseph Gordon Levitt. I wished Shailene Woodly had a more interesting role, but it was oke. The visuals were standard overall, with sometimes a little interesting twist, but not often enough to be noticeable. But with this kind of story the visuals arn't that important.<br/><br/>So yes, i'd say mediocre movie. Would have been better is the pacing wasn't that off and if it had been a lot shorter. I'd say watch Citizen Four instead. But it is also not a terrible watch. You wont be angry if you've seen it."

","I am not one who, generally, likes to place any credence on the Hollywood excuse of dramatizing events to 'educate' the public. But, I am also one who is not inclined to watch Oliver Stone's genre of movies of any kind. This movie becomes an exception to that rule and only because of a chance encounter with it in a local library. Watching this movie compelled me to review the Snowden story. I tend to agree that this insistence that twisting the facts to make a movie more interesting is 'artistic license which often offends me. However, the results of this movie are that the people who are expected to diss it, for example, NSA overseers, do try to dismiss its value. I do intend, now, to watch Citizenfour, hoping that it will be truer to the truths behind the Snowden incident. What is disappointing is that this movie, with its astute references to the duty of every government employee, EVERYWHERE, to protect the truth and our freedoms over the motives of the entrenched elitists of our society, has NOT motivated many citizens on this planet to ask why the principles of the 1946 trials in Nuremberg are not legally protected in ANY OF our so-called 'democratic nations' on this planet. I am 66 years old, a former scientist who lost his job temporarily for daring to demand that the scientific truths I was responsible to be protected (in 1982). I paused from writing 'those books' which are my record as to why Snowden was indeed a principled man, no matter what the detractors say. Perhaps every viewer should watch this movie with the subtitles on and then ask why 'grand America', whose citizens seem to think like that 'fictional' NSA overseer, is NOT the protectorate of our freedoms and is, instead, silent to the very thing parts of this movie warn us about. In 2018, this movie, despite its shortcomings when it comes to dealing with the facts of the Snowden incident, should awaken ALL true 'democrats' to why a lawyer with constitutional training, Barack Obama, would summarily execute a distant murderer without trial (Osama bin Laden), justify this violation of international law and then become vindictive when the corruption of these partisan serving agencies is exposed by a whistleblower. This film is good at exposing the background dilemma which comes from making partisans, bound to their rich donors, above the law. Obama, this film reminds us, failed this planet and democracy so badly that we are left with a man like Trump, with a finger poised on dangerous weapons of mass destruction, 'for America'. It is sad that this movie seems to have failed us in opening up a debate which the subtitles do expose: when we suppress the freedoms that are compelled to allow criticism of those in positions of power, we do take this planet back to 1929. No matter what the lessons of Nuremberg are, which Oliver Stone appropriately draws into a movie which should compel greater citizen engagement in questioning all of this into 2018. Is it this movie which fails us or are we back to 1933 where journalists and others warned and the citizenry remained more interested in the theatre and movies?

Scripts are written to fit a mold.<br/><br/>While this movie presents the ideal of stopping a Big Brother government from spying on all the people and collecting information to be used at a later time against the public should you do something considered to be a threat to the political and religious nature of the government, it is still a movie.<br/><br/>I thought the casting was very good, the script moved along smoothly. I enjoyed the cinematography. I enjoyed the ending.<br/><br/>However, I do not believe Snowden is a patriot but I do not believe he is a terrorist either. He is a young man who was put in to a position of questioning his job and the desire for his government to spy on their own people.<br/><br/>He had morals and ethics, which is more than I can say for any part of the American government for the last 100 years. He felt what was happening was wrong and that he needed to expose the truth.<br/><br/>I do not believe what he did was wrong, I think he did it for righteous reasons, but he also harmed America and released information which set in motion another moment when America was weakened and put in to a position of international stress.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but it isn't perfect."
"blrnani","8","1","1","9 May 2018"," One of the most important films of modern times
","Irrespective of what one may think of the acting and directing (which I found just fine), the actual story sits alongside ""Inside Job"" and ""Sicko"" as revelations as to how the American way has been subverted in the name of unprincipled profit and corporate world domination. It is hardly surprising that Russia, China and even allies are pulling back from global partnership as they have realised how the USA's leaders cannot be trusted as partners, since their goal is US supremacy and control, vital agreements are discarded from one presidency to the next and cooperation is only interesting as long as it yields advantages (we still remember how the leader of a major nation who acted like that led us all into a global war).
It is tragic, because the ordinary American people are not like that and have always been noted for their willingness to help those in need, at home and abroad. Whistleblowers like Snowden are essential to a healthy society and it is disgraceful that in the USA they fear for their freedom, their jobs, economic well-being and even their lives. 
Watch this film to see how a proud American had his faith that his country's practices matched its espoused values eroded by what he saw in his privileged position within the intelligence community. And be proud of him that once it went too far he did something about it, even knowing that it would be at considerable personal cost."

","This is a biopic of Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) covering the years from 2004-2013 told as a flashback with some narration. The film shows his training, the fact he didn't finish high school, his time with the CIA, and then using the ""intelligence revolving door"" as a contractor. The film also concentrates on his relationship with the liberal leaning Lindsey Mills (Shailene Woodley) who appears to be an influence on his decision to be a ""martyr"".<br/><br/>We see the development of Snowden's ideology as he witnesses entrapment, endangerment, blackmail, and killing of suspect terrorist with little to no over site. But what really set him off was the idea of the NSA can see Lindsey's tatas and American privacy was not a FISA court issue.<br/><br/>This is an Oliver Stone film so the slant should go without saying, although the issue of government spying transcends most politics here and across the world. Stone creates fictional characters and relationships to weave his tale in a more concise, entertaining, and informative manner. These ""nuances"" (sometimes known as lies) need to be overlooked to enjoy a Stone film, which is about theme. This one raises the debate of freedom vs security, but not as entertainingly as ""A Few Good Men."" Did Snowden expose our intelligence gathering ability and damage our security?

"lavatch","Null","7","18","17 September 2016"," Snowden: Lost in the World of George Orwell
","""Snowden"" is directed by Oliver Stone with a stylish approach to a story that could have been written by George Orwell. Stone transports the audience visually into the world of underground security facilities and inside the computers themselves. The result is the nightmare of a national power elite that controls human freedom and civil liberties not by the Constitution, but by modern technology.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding the role of the self-taught computer prodigy Edward Snowden. Gordon-Levitt hits all the right notes in bringing complexity and an arc of development to an idealistic young man, who throughout his young career and his whistleblowing experience is naive about his goal of making a difference in the world.<br/><br/>There is a stunning scene in the home stretch of the film when Snowden is having a conversation with his CIA mentor, Corbin O'Brian, who is brilliantly played by Rhys Ifans. It is no coincidence that the fictional character O'Brian is the namesake of the villain of Orwell's dystopian novel ""1984,"" who is also called O'Brien. At the beginning of the scene it is appears that O'Brian and Snowden are in the same room. But as the dialogue progresses, it becomes clear that O'Brian is speaking to Snowden on a large projection screen, informing the young man that he has essentially used the technology Snowden has helped to perfect to inform on the personal life of Snowden's girlfriend. The chilling effect of the scene is that of recreating Orwell's concept of ""Big Brother.""<br/><br/>Another strength of the film was the thoughtful screenplay that effectively portrayed Snowden in his own words in conversation with journalist Glenn Greenwald and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras. There was a cinéma vérité approach to the story that seemed perfect for the film's theme of the abuses of the law by the United States government.<br/><br/>""Snowden"" is a story that needs to be told. The unanswered question of the film is whether or not the case of Edward Snowden will bring about reform. Can we get some sanity in the uses of technology in the intelligence community? Or will we continue to descend into the vortex of the totalitarian world described by George Orwell over sixty years ago?"

","""Snowden"" had received a 7.5 rating (when I checked in December 2016) and this meant for me: this one you must see! I am from Holland and off course did hear about Edward Snowden, what he did and also why he did it. But I did not know all the details. So I was able to see a high rated movie containing true facts from which you can learn something.<br/><br/>When watching the movie I noticed, unexpectedly, multiple talented actors right away like Nicolas Cage, Zachary Quinto, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Shailene Woodley, Rhys Ifans, etc. So my expectations got higher. But the movie progressed really slow and I was waiting for the promised pulse-pounding and politically-charged thriller to start... the movie just did not really get exciting and certainly not pulse-pounding. Without the good acting and the true facts I would probably have stopped the movie halfway. <br/><br/>So why the high ratings from reviewers? When I read other reviews I notice people are writing about Edward Snowden and the bravery of his acts. I read that this movie had to be made to create more awareness. If I had to review Mr. Snowden and what he did then yes, I would also give 8 or 9 stars. But we have to review this Oliver Stone movie and it is just not that good. I rated the movie with a 6 only because of the good acting."

","The movie has done justice to the amazing real-life characters it depicts. It shows the facts without deviations and can touch it's viewers at an emotional level. I was happy that unlike Julian Assange's depiction in The Fifth Estate, this one got not only the actors right but even the story-line is accurate to reflect truths. It's a shame that the movie was not launched in several countries. For example, in my own country India this would have been a huge deal and many would have gone and seen it. It would not only help expose the truths but also stir hearts of the common people as even here the situation is gradually turning the same way. Besides, it was one of those movies I had wanted to watch but it never released and I expect that's one of the reasons the movie never made it to it's budget. I'm looking forward to more such movies from Oliver Stone—for example an Aaron Swartz movie would be good. This movie is a must watch and I recommend it."
"CrenshawPete","10","5","13","25 September 2016"," Brilliant! But read the book BEFORE you see it!
","I'll try to keep this short. I loved the movie. Oliver Stone and Joseph Gordon-Levitt nailed it. I've read the critics' reviews, and some are saying this movie could have been so much more. Like a political statement? They've completely missed the point. The movie is called ""Snowden"" for a reason. It's not called ""PRISM"" or ""NSA"", because it's about Snowden, himself. It's the answer to ""who"" and ""why"".<br/><br/>If you want to know what's in those files, you'll need to read ""No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State"" by Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who Snowden sought out to release the information. Hopefully people will read the book (the answer to ""what""). There's very little overlap with the movie, but it will definitely help you understand the events in the film better. Also, the book is shocking -- like jaw-dropping shocking.<br/><br/>I'd read it about a year ago and thought they did a heck of a job recreating the scenes at the hotel, even if that part of the story was super-condensed. In the book, there's actually a lot more drama going on during that part of the story. But again, this movie was more about the lead-up to the leak, not so much the aftermath. My dad enjoyed the movie, but since he hadn't read the book, he said it was sometime difficult for him to follow. Even if you're unfamiliar with the details of the spying programs, you'll get an ""executive summary"" in the film.<br/><br/>It's a complex topic, and I think they simplified it as best anyone could. I hope people will read the book and see the movie. As again, they serve two different purposes, but both are necessary to get the complete picture. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a highly underrated actor, does such a good job playing Snowden that at times it feels like a documentary. If you liked Spy Game, Syriana, The Insider, and The Imitation Game, then you'll definitely enjoy Snowden. A solid 10/10<br/><br/>Edit: It seems trolls (probably paid) are voting down positive reviews of this film. That's not surprising given the subject matter, but it only shows their desperation. They don't want you to learn about this heroic person or the serious issue of unaccountable government and corporate surveillance. All the more reason people need to see this movie!"
"cultfilmfan","10","5","13","17 September 2016"," Snowden
","Over all the films I have seen by writer/director Oliver Stone over the years, I have always found him to be his absolute best when he is tackling a story, or a film centered on either politics, government and the conspiracies that sometimes go with it and various other headline grabbing issues involved with those who are currently, or were at one time in political office. I wish Stone would stick to making more of those type of films such as JFK, or even W., which I for one thought was vastly misunderstood and underrated by the critics. I am so glad that as a filmmaker he has chosen again to shed light on what is bound to be a controversial film and figure in it's lead subject, Edward Snowden. Now if you have seen any of Stone's films related to politics, or anything slightly controversial, or even if you have just listened to him on a television interview, it is no secret that he tends to be more liberal at heart and is more, or less against capitalism, or what would be seen as more conservative type ideologies, or beliefs. Surprisingly though, I thought he would paint an absolutely scathing portrait of George W. Bush in his 2008 film W., but much to my surprise and delight I found the film to be almost more sympathetic towards Bush and more, or less saying that he missed the ball (as demonstrated in some cleverly used metaphorical images in the film) as a president, but maybe his intentions were not all bad and he isn't the demon that the liberal media made him out to be. Certainly food for thought and something different than Stone's more typical left wing bias. Here we have the film, Snowden and again right from the beginning of the film we see that he is clearly on the side of Snowden, and truly believes that what he did was a truly patriotic and heroic act and that Snowden was truly acting on behalf of Americans and their freedom and ultimately their privacy and well being and with his film he is very clearly saying that Snowden is a hero even if not all persons think so. The film even if it does have this particular bias, or theme in mind while portraying him and the events that led him to leaking all this classified information against the government, even so the film is tremendously fascinating and truly one of those films that truly engages the viewer in thoughts and much deep thinking not only during the film, but afterwards as well. We as an audience are led through the events that cover almost a ten plus year history of the events that led up to Snowden making this decision and why he chose to do what he did. The film also shows that what Snowden did was certainly not an easy choice and it did bring him many tough decisions and problems that affected his relationships as well as his own health. The whole gamut of why he did what he did and the reasons he had for doing it and what Stone and company consider to be a totally and completely selfless act and that is part of why what he did was in their minds so courageous and why he should be labelled a hero. Watching this fascinating and engrossing account certainly gave me a lot to ponder and think about while watching the film and I do not know if it was just the overall power and effect of the film that got to me, or how absolutely convincing it was in it's overall argument in Snowden's favour, but I have to be honest and say that they make a very valid and true point with this film and this is truly something to be considered and evaluated seriously and maybe what the government was doing was wrong and in this case, perhaps Snowden was truly justified in doing what he did and maybe the label of ""hero"" is actually well deserved. The film constructs this case as if it were a prize winning PhD thesis and it truly wins marks for effort and persuasive storytelling while also being convincing and giving every side a fair chance. The screenplay truly accomplishes a lot and is so well constructed and put together that it is one of Stone's best not just lately, but of his whole body of work. The performance here by Joseph Gordon Levitt as Snowden, was one that I found to be a truly interesting performance and character and not just with the different tone of voice that Levitt used, but by humanizing and really allowing us to empathize and support what Snowden was doing. The fact that what he did also cost him a lot adds to this and Levitt's performance truly shows an honourable man with many inner demons and struggles who goes to a lot to achieve what he thinks is right. This is one of the most powerful films of the year and also the most interesting and I encourage everyone who is interested in this case, whether you be for, or against Snowden to give it a shot and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. One of the year's best."

","Stone does a disservice to future generations by putting his own spin on important national topics. Is there some truth to his stories, yes, but mostly he creates hyperbolic and personal views of his subjects as if he was a comic strip creator, not a movie producer/director. The intelligence community is pretty anal when it comes to security. If you've ever worked in the field they usually put up a lot of fences that prevent getting anything done. That a system engineer is able to steal the information snowden he did is very perplexing but there's been little media attention to this. Anyway, snowden is portrayed as this supremely intelligent hacker with unique access to programs and data. I don't know the real story but what I've seen of snowden in interviews is not very impressive. The bit about putting a towel over his head to protect his passwords had me rolling on the floor. All the tech talk and exaggerated capabilities of the nsa/cia is hogwash made up by someone ignorant of the field. It's just that kind of ignorance that has created a huge industry for consumer data protection and given the green light to the govt to waste billions of dollars every year on useless programs. Consider the DNC hack as an example. This was all human error not some sophisticated tech hack as covered in the media but you bet software security companies will make a mint off this. For a better idea of the truth behind the programs snowden complained about, read bamford's books."

It fits perfect into the whole movie, as a mix of Biopic and Thriller.<br/><br/>A big plus is how Stone sets up the relationship of Snowden and his partner Lindsay. They give the audience a chance to breathe and to ask fundamental questions like: What is private? What is political? Who is allowed to know what? Snowden said: ""To argue, I do not care about privacy, because I have nothing to hide, is so as to say, freedom of expression does not care, because I have nothing to say.""

The soundtrack, while mainly absent throughout the film, was great and was able to evoke character and audience emotion(s) when one of the scores swells up, mainly when a scene of tension is done correctly. Shailene Woodly was surprisingly good, and was able to pull of her character extremely well. That ended up making it where her character was able to play of of JGL character.

","Now in December 2016 with the schism between the US and Russia altering because of the hacking of the elections and Russia's role in that conundrum – now is the finest hour to view this film about the very real terror of the Internet informational control of the globe. Oliver Stone with Kieran Fitzgerald have adapted Anatoly Kucherena's and Luke Harding's books and very creatively combined fact with drama in presenting a captivating expose of Edward Snowden's leak to the public of NSA's illegal surveillance techniques in the form of thousands of classified documents distributed to the press. Yes, the film focuses on the drama of the leak but it also offers a keen look at Edward Snowden's personality and intelligence and the conflicts he faced is carrying out this impart 'crime' to the world. We are all at risk.<br/><br/>The film opens in Hong Kong, Monday June 3, 2013, as documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) meets with columnist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) at a hotel. They are met by Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in the lobby. Snowden brings the two to his room to begin documenting everything that has led up to this moment. In a flashback to 2004, Snowden was enlisted in the Special Forces as a candidate. Although he was persistent, he suffered an injury when he broke his legs after landing on them during a drill. The doctor tells Snowden that his legs were broken for weeks but only now have sustained a more serious injury. He warns Snowden that the bones in his legs will turn to powder if he lands on them again, so Snowden is discharged from the military. In 2006, Snowden began training for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency. He started a class under Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans). One of Snowden's first tests is to solve a problem using a sequence. Snowden finishes first, and O'Brian checks his work to see what mistake he made. Snowden explains that he solved the problem by going out of order in the sequence, to the surprise of not only O'Brian, but the rest of the class as well. Snowden befriends a professor named Hank Forrester (Nicolas Cage), who appears to have had an influence on Snowden far more than O'Brian. Outside of work, Snowden chats online with a girl named Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). They finally meet up one afternoon and go for a walk around the park. Lindsay takes several photos of Snowden, and they end up having their first kiss. In the present day of June 4, 2013 in Hong Kong, Snowden, Poitras, and Greenwald are joined by Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson), an intelligence reporter from The Guardian. MacAskill reports to editor Janine Gibson (Joely Richardson) in regards to the story that Snowden is telling them. In a flashback to 2007, Snowden is stationed in Geneva, Switzerland to maintain computer network security. Lindsay joins him on his trip. He meets with a CIA agent (Timothy Olyphant) who guides him through his task. The ending everyone knows. The film is quite long and the length adds to the tension and the credibility of the development of the drama. The crucial small roles are exceptionally well acted by Scott Eastwood, Ben Chaplin, Ben Schnetzer, Bhasker Patel and a host of others.<br/><br/>This is a film that should be seen by everyone.

","""I no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow because I'm happy with what I've done today"" Edward Snowden (Gordon-Levitt) wants to serve his country in anyway he can after the military doesn't work out. What starts off as a dream job with the CIA changes into something he can't reconcile with himself. He moves from career to career but nothing changes, until he decides to tell the public what he knows. This is a movie that will elicit many emotions from people and a massive political debate can be the result of watching this. I will take that out of the review since this is a movie and not a documentary. Oliver Stone has been my favorite director for a while and he proves it again here. The movies he makes are not just movies they are statements. This is no different. I'm not sure how much is realistic and how much is added but I will say that the movie deals with his emotions and the reasons he did what he did. If you go into this movie with an open mind you will get the desired experience. If you go on with your stance firmly on either side you will find things that will enhance your opinion. That's the beauty of Oliver Stone. Overall, Joseph Gorden-Levitt says it best when he said, ""its not just your average drama. It's an Oliver Stone movie."" I give this an A."

","Based on the books The Snowden Files by Luke Harding and Time of the Octopus by Anatoly Kucherena, 'Snowden' is an Engrossing & Alarming Biographical Political Thriller, Directed by the Legendary Oliver Stone. The film unfolds a shocking incident, that shock the world, with consistently engaging writing & a Solid Performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden.<br/><br/>'Snowden' Synopsis: The NSA's illegal surveillance techniques are leaked to the public by one of the agency's employees, Edward Snowden, in the form of thousands of classified documents distributed to the press.<br/><br/>Edward Snowden did what he thought was right. You may call him a traitor for leaking information related to the Government, but what he saw & uncovered, couldn't have been kept as a secret. He thought about the people & although not all may respect that, its definitely a move instigated by circumstances & a sense of concern.<br/><br/>And 'Snowden' is strongly structured film that captures his turbulent journey. Stone & Kieran Fitzgerald's Screenplay is consistently engaging & the pace never drops. Its to the point! And Stone directs the film with his usual force, keeping the narrative engrossing as well as alarming. You're with Snowden as his uncovers a shocking truth & you stay with him till the end. Stone is in true-form here & 'Snowden' is definitely among his best films to date!<br/><br/>Cinematography is well-done. Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are decent. Craig Armstrong's score is effective.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Joseph Gordon-Levitt steals the show. He enacts Edward Snowden with fierce commitment. A long-due Oscar Nomination, would seem justified. Shailene Woodley as Lindsay Mills, delivers a credible turn as Snowden's lady-love. Also, she looks gorgeous! Melissa Leo as Laura Poitras, Zachary Quinto as Glenn Greenwald & Tom Wilkinson as Ewen MacAskill, lend good support. Rhys Ifans as Corbin O'Brian & Nicolas Cage as Hank Forrester, are superb. Scott Eastwood as Trevor James, Timothy Olyphant as CIA Agent Geneva & Logan Marshall-Green as a male drone pilot, also do their brief bits well.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Snowden' is a Winner. Highly Recommended!"
"FelipeCarrillo","9","3","7","17 December 2016"," ""Law Does Not Replace Conscience""
","Edward Joseph Snowden, name surrounded by disputes, polemics, and two-dimensional opinions. This talented young of Maryland was an important American computer professional, informer, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government. Nevertheless, It was not until he exhibited by 'The Guardian' and 'The Washington Post' newspapers thousands of classified NSA documents around the massive monitoring 'PRISM' and 'XKeyscore' programs, which violated privacy rights of each citizen with excuses of ""dodging terrorism"" that he got sufficient recognition, all this during the mandate of President Barack Obama. This, a controversial story inspired by real events— with political and social touches—was the opportunity that the American director needed to be released from that curse of the new millennium.<br/><br/>From Academy Award-winning Oliver Stone, who is known for projecting important issues in American democratic scene in his films, has returned in a work rather remarkable, nonetheless, it is not capable of preponderating between films as tenacious and subtle such as ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""JKF"" or ""Nixon"" at all. Oliver Stone is one of the American directors possessing the same number of supporters and detractors on the basis of his intense movies, something similar to the case of Quentin Tarantino, you either love them or hate them. Although recently we have seen him mostly in political documentaries on account of the unexpected and fateful film blunder of new millennium, he comes back with his all strength— they are not the same as before—in a biographical thriller motion picture, which can be dangerous and erroneously compared with 2014 documentary directed by the selfsame reporter who carried out the unmasking Laura Poitras, ""Citizenfour"". Erroneously because regardless of taking the same main topic (Snowden), they develop a drama with visual and narrative tactics, elements and technologies as different as suggestive.<br/><br/>This man adopted the name of ""traitor or hero"" due to maneuvers and mechanisms which Edward had to revert for fulfilling his objective. Even if you consider him a traitor, the portrait made by Stone of Snowden is deliberately positive, always justifying his reasons and showing one side of the coin that many people does not accept. This time, the director takes his imposing and Manichean voice in order to show those who do not know thoroughly the motivations and ways of the American fugitive, who revealed—whether good, bad or both—an unavoidable truth, his love, personal and more prominently professional life. Even though the story had potential of being a commercial film a la ""Bourne"", obviously leaving physical action behind, but what his director did was narrate it in the way that it had to be: cautious, thoughtful and occasionally predictable but attractive, significant and surprising.<br/><br/>Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Kieran Fitzgerald (""The Homesman""), based on the interviews of documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) and journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""The Walk"") portrays a version in flesh and blood more human, sensitive, and reliable from that impartial and cold face colliding into worldwide newspapers and news in 2013. Transforming his tone of voice, adopting his obsessions and expressions, Gordon- Levitt is chief sunlight in this lugubrious galaxy of information; without his impressive transformation, Stone's journey would have been grimmer and perhaps neither permissible. In addition to the main lead, Shailene Woodley, who did not propose in her first scenes, achieves a balance in a whirl of emotions and situations in refined and consistent way, a total delight.<br/><br/>The narrative subject of the movie is a great skill for keeping to audience watches out, in order to spectators do entire transition process of the character with the character. An anachronism that goes from the interview which gives shape to the story to passages and circumstances which are narrated in voice-over by Snowden using explanatory flashbacks and even if we rule thirty or forty minutes out to the extensive motion picture (two hours), it would have been more propitious, the whole story has an essential point. As for the visual landscape, Stone opts it safe with his interlarded angles and low- angle shots from modern expressionism building the footage, perhaps, he would have been more ambitious, assuming risks in staging.<br/><br/>Some might say that Stone is deifying Snowden with his work, dispensing with dilemma of being a hero or criminal. ""Snowden"" produces a formidable biography, supported with a well-told story and a dazzling performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, nonetheless, Stone goes to fields already inspected and does not generate the shock what should do with such real story."
"MeesTW","8","3","7","16 November 2016"," The modern battlefield is everywhere
","Snowden provides a solid character study, while it also focuses on very relevant social, economic and political subjects.<br/><br/>Our main character is not portrayed as a good guy, he is a man seeking refuge from the law: just like a criminal would. Him being some sort of an evil man is contradicted by JGL's performance. His character shows both confidence and trust when we get to meet him. Speaking of which, Edward Snowden has a brilliant introduction in this film, the Rubik's cube he is holding is a symbol of his intellect.<br/><br/>The story in this film is not paced very good. The combination between Ed's relationship drama and his job does not always work. While the relationship between the two characters is actually very interesting, it's brought down by constantly switching from drama (the relationship) to suspense (Snowden's job). <br/><br/>Like many other Oliver Stone films, this movie once again gives an interesting commentary on modern day America. Oliver Stone is not afraid to show the actual truth. As you're reading this, you're most likely being watched. That's what this film is trying to tell you. There is no such thing as privacy anymore. Nowadays, the US government can listen to anything you say. They know where you are, they know who you're talking to, and trust me, they know about your fears. You turn on a cell phone or a computer, and you're doomed. This was what Edward Snowden was fighting against, since this was manipulated very heavily by the US government.<br/><br/>As I'm writing this review, on November the 17th, it's been almost ten days since the US presidential elections have ended. Snowden's other political undertones focus on the media. Edward Snowden knows that the mainstream media likes to spread false narratives, he knows that not everything you hear/see on the news is true. This election has proved him right. CNN, MSNBC, ABC News and other networks like that have all been exposed creating false narratives. Even Donald Trump makes a short (off-screen) cameo.<br/><br/>Snowden made me think. There is one philosophical question I got out of this film: Is it rational to break rules to help people? Edward Snowden, mainly seen as a good person is a criminal, which is a fact. But he did break those rules for the greater good.<br/><br/>I walked out of the theaters satisfied once it was finished. I thought the story and structure needed some work, but I am once again very happy to see Oliver Stone's take on American politics and society. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a fantastic performance of an American hero, which happens to be a very well written character.<br/><br/>8/10"
"FabledGentleman","8","3","7","29 September 2016"," Oliver Stone is back, doing what he does best
","I just got home from the preview of the film that had Oliver Stone and one of the producers of the film present, to be interviewed and to talk about the film and Edward Snowden in general. It was shown in Colosseum cinema in Oslo (Norway) which is the biggest THX certified cinema in the world. So they could not have chosen a better place to launch their new piece.<br/><br/>But this is not really only Oliver Stones piece, more so it's a movie that is crafted after several interviews done with Edward Snowden. Oliver Stone traveled nine times to Russia to talk to him, and one of those times he took Gordon-Levitt with him to let them meet. The film script has then been molded around everything Snowden has told them, making the story as authentic to the truth as they possibly could.<br/><br/>I am a big supporter of Edward Snowden and has never doubted his intentions. I have always thought he did the right thing, and i was therefor really excited for what this movie would tell us that we didn't already know. For those, including me, that have seen ""Citizenfour"" and followed this case in the media, we already know a lot about Edward Snowden and why he did what he did.<br/><br/>I got to say, this film reminds me of the glory days of Oliver Stone, with great films like ""Platoon"" and ""JFK"". Oliver Stone has been on a sort of a downward spiral for years, making not so good films like ""W."", ""World Trade Center"", ""Wall street: Money never sleeps"" and ""Alexander"", he has finally now returned to what he does best. But he already gave us ""a hint"" of his greatness with his absolutely brilliant 10 episode documentary series ""The Untold History Of The United States"" which was released in 2013. If you haven't seen that, see it now.<br/><br/>Most of us already know what the story in this film is about, So i wont go into any details about that, but in short USA is monitoring ""everything"", reading normal peoples private emails, looking at them live through their webcams and so on, without them knowing any of it. And are doing it on a scale so massive it cannot be justified, no matter how you look at it.<br/><br/>After working for CIA and NSA for years, Snowden did what he had to do, he could no longer sit silent and let this go unnoticed. Snowden thinks the public has the right to know that their country is spying on them, spending tens of billions of dollars storing their lives digitally for all future, so he copies the files, smuggles them out and give it to reporters. And now he has to spend his life on the run, like a criminal, an outlaw without a country, forced to hide.<br/><br/>I think, even after watching this film, many people won't understand the scale and the importance of what has happened here. It is simply to big to comprehend for many. People are willing to sacrifice their privacy for a little more security, not understanding what they are giving up, and how little they get in return. Not to mention what will happen if all this data ends up in the wrong hands, this is basically every dictators wet dream.<br/><br/>But despite the fact Snowden is now on the run, hiding from the very people he tried to help, and has lost his normal life, Edward Snowden has never felt more free than he is now, revealing this to the public lifted an enormous burden off his shoulders, and we should forever be grateful for what he has done.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone shares my views on Edward Snowden and has managed to make a really good film out of this, he explains the system so that most people can understand it. And he is doing a fine job centering Snowden at the core, driving the story forward, brilliantly portrayed by Gordon-Levitt. It took only minutes for me to forget that i was watching him act, all i saw was Snowden himself. And most of the other actors and actresses delivers solid and good performances as well. The movie accomplishes to keep the nerve the whole way through.<br/><br/>The weak parts of the film however, is the portrayal of Edward Snowdens love life with his girlfriend Lindsay Mills. These scenes feels forced at times, and they are there to remind us what Snowden actually was risking giving up. I get that, but i already know what he gave up. The scenes are to short and to few to work the way they were intended. They are not bad scenes, but they don't hold the standard to the rest of the film which is done really well and clever.<br/><br/>My final words, this is an important film, and should be seen by everyone. Edward Snowden is a highly intelligent, normal, shy, neighborhood guy, that just happened to end up working for the biggest agencies in the world, working on some of the most highly classified systems that ever existed. Snowden is a hero, and he deserves recognition.<br/><br/>8/10 - Good"
"bbird-29353","3","4","11","10 May 2017"," Rather Boring Portrayal of an Important Issue
","Don't try to use this movie to educate yourself about the Edward Snowden story. You're basically getting the director's slanted interpretation. A documentary on him, how he did it, and why would be much better for that purpose. Taken as pure entertainment, I found the movie boring. The only suspense is when he is copying files, might be noticed, and, when done, drops the SD card on the carpet. Gordon-Levitt's portrayal is flat and there's no chemistry between him and Melissa Leo (his girlfriend). Again, watch a documentary to hopefully get a more-balanced portrayal of the Snowden story and look elsewhere for internet hacking entertainment."
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","4","11","27 September 2016"," Overripe and Sloppy
","In many ways an Edward Snowden dramatization of some kind, directed by Oliver Stone was inevitable. Even if on the off chance Universal or some other company was working on a sleek, risk-less enterprise directed by some artless hack, Oliver Stone still would have pounced on the movie rights to this story even if he had to do a Capote (2005) Vs. Infamous (2006) to do it. I'm sure there will be others detailing the exploits of NSA contractor turned espionage pariah Edward Snowden, but for now the filmmaker behind World Trade Center (2006), W. (2008) and JFK (1991) has our undivided attention.<br/><br/>At 28-years-old, Edward Joseph Snowden (Gordon-Levitt) was a top computer systems administrator for Booz Allen Hamilton; a consulting firm running interference for the CIA and NSA. Before then he was a top CIA cyber-security expert and self-proclaimed ""computer wizard;"" skills he first exhibited during his CIA training in Langley, VA. At 29-years-old, everything Snowden had worked for suddenly evaporated; gone in a calculated effort to expose a vast network of surveillance programs run by the NSA in cooperation with multiple telecommunications companies. He was also, a fugitive on the run from the United States government. That was in 2013. At the time, Snowden's actions were (and as of this writing still are) the largest unauthorized government leaks in history. Today he resides in Russia which has granted him asylum for the time being.<br/><br/>Politics aside, Snowden as a movie leaves much to be desired. Director Oliver Stone employs the same frenzied collage format that made JFK such an unnerving conspiratorial experience. Yet while that very bold, very Stone-esque directorial choice does its job evoking a feeling of unease and distrust, it's wholly unnecessary here. It never matches the straightforward story nor the temperament of the lead character but only seems to give the non-linear narrative a false sense of unpredictability. It never seems to match the tone at all especially given that we largely know how the story is going to end. The film swings wildly like a boozy zealot screaming from a park bench on a calm Sunday afternoon. Stone seems to want to make a film in the vein of The Fifth Estate (2013) but gets caught up on over-explaining computer jargon and propping up blackhat strawmen to beat down. At times it feels much more about him than his subject.<br/><br/>It's a shame too because Joseph Gordon-Levitt turns in an absolutely tremendous performance as our lead. Gordon-Levitt is one of those unfortunate actors that suffer from what I like to call DiCaprio Syndrome. No matter how much he stretches and molds into a role, I still only see the good-natured actor underneath. I won't go so far as to say he completely encapsulates the role but his instincts as a cautious and cloistered computer geek turned traitor prove that he's more than just a pretty face.<br/><br/>Likewise Shailene Woodley largely succeeds in thanklessly rummaging what little she could of a psychology-free character i.e. Snowden's longtime paramour Lindsay Mills. As an actress she's a charming and likable ingenue and has managed to not only impress but wow in everything from weighty dramas to mindless franchise dribble. Frankly playing the sidelined girlfriend is beneath her abilities.<br/><br/>Snowden is a sloppy, witless political thriller whose clumsy treatment of its subject matter may have been confused back in the day as a Frank Capra-level working-stiff hagiography. One which elevates the action of one man that can ""stop the motor of the world"" and whose actions are saintly within a certain context. In today's day and age however, it can be assumed audiences can be trusted with complexity. Anyone looking for cheer-leading and choir- preaching should look out for Snowden; otherwise watch the documentary Citizenfour (2014) instead."
"redfor","10","4","11","20 September 2016"," SNOWDEN: Stone's Masterpiece
","Early in the film and due to his injuries, Edward Snowden's military career is over. ""Plenty of other ways to serve your country"", is what he's told. Soon afterwards – while beginning to understand his work as a government-intelligence-agency 'spook' – he hears the phrase ""Family comes first"" in a very telling way. He learns quickly that the desire for national security knows no bounds, and the betrayal of even trusted information sources is fair game.<br/><br/>Thus begins this fabulous morality play: do the data needs of the U.S. government outweigh the rights of its citizens? Knowing what he does, must Snowden share his secrets with the world? Shailene Woodley's turn in 'THE DESCENDANTS' was fabulous; she's wonderful here, as well. Portraying Snowden's girlfriend, she provides the human-side of the losses Edward faces. The film-within-a-film crew is terrific; the cinematographer among them is the other strong female character. The entire cast and crew have done a wonderful job on this, Oliver Stone's best work. <br/><br/>The cinematography, lighting, music, and special effects nail this production down perfectly. Hell, the fact that a microwave oven blocks UHF frequencies, sure was news to me. The dialogue delivers some memorable lines, such as: ""Most Americans don't want freedom, they want security""; ""One man can stop the motor of the world""; and ""The modern battlefield is everywhere.""<br/><br/>Is this an 'epic' film? As a four-letter acronym in the movie, it references a newer definition for epic: Electronic Privacy Information Center. Here's the URL for more information on this: https://epic.org/. I can't wait to have 'SNOWDEN' in my film library, it's that good."
"makleen2","7","2","4","16 September 2017"," A Masterfully-Crafted Fairytale
","Oliver Stone's latest film, Snowden, a biopic about NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden, is an effective piece of propaganda. It's nearly flawless as a film in terms of acting, editing, pacing, and dialog, but lacks the depth usually given to such a controversial subject.<br/><br/>First, here's what Snowden gets right. Every actor and actress in this movie is on point. Every character feels genuine. Nicolas Cage, in top form, even makes a cameo as Hank Forrester, a (fictional) disillusioned CIA instructor. Shailene Woodley is perfect as Lindsay Mills, a free spirited, liberal photographer Snowden falls in love with.<br/><br/>One of the advantages of portraying a living person is you are able to study their mannerisms, tone, and expressions. Joseph Gordon-Levitt studied his subject well. Levitt, as Snowden, narrates throughout the entire film, as he is telling his story to a group of journalists, but the dialog is tight and the narration never gets bogged down in needless exposition.<br/><br/>Snowden is well-crafted. In one particularly memorable scene, Corbin O'Brian, Snowden's fictional CIA handler, takes Snowden hunting and they discuss his career's future. The natural scene, the birds, hounds, metal and wooden shotguns, a hunting lodge, are perfectly juxtaposed against their conversation about cyberspace, computer network defense, and foreign enemies.<br/><br/>It was a conversation Oliver Stone could have easily set in a fast paced room with wires, computer monitors, servers, and shadowy figures typing furiously at keyboards, but instead he chose to ground these abstract concepts in a stark, low-tech, almost serene environment.<br/><br/>The film's visual authenticity is also its greatest weakness: because Snowden is almost entirely fictional. It is a fairy tale meant to portray Edward Snowden as a reluctant hero who is compelled to speak out against an out-of-control national security state, explicitly compared in one scene with Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>For me, the film raised red flags in the very beginning when in basic training Snowden calls his drill sergeant ""Sir."" Soldiers in the U.S. Army do not call drill sergeants ""Sir."" You may think this is nitpicking, but if Oliver Stone is willing to fudge this minor detail for the sake of convention, or because it's what the audience expects to hear, what other facts is he willing to fudge for the sake of the story? Quite a bit, as it turns out. Some characters and situations are simply made up. Oliver Stone portrays Snowden as a genius and a rising star in the intelligence community, which jives with his own inflated image of himself. Snowden reportedly lied on his resume, saying he attended Johns Hopkins University, a Tokyo campus of the University of Maryland, and the University of Liverpool in Britain.<br/><br/>In fact, Johns Hopkins has no record of him attending classes there, he attended one summer semester at the University of Maryland, and registered for but did not attend classes at the University of Liverpool. This inflated sense of accomplishment is reflected in the film–not as a personality flaw, but as undisputed truth.<br/><br/>Contrast Snowden with the 2013 thriller about Julian Assange and Wikileaks, The Fifth Estate, and this one-sided portrayal becomes even more obvious. The Fifth Estate portrayed Julian Assange as a complex figure–someone who believed he was acting for the greater good but whose personal flaws cast a shadow over his actions.<br/><br/>Snowden only shows one side of the story–as told by Snowden himself. Therefore, the audience is never led to question Snowden's version of events. In my opinion, this takes away from what otherwise would be a compelling film about current events."
"rajanmogha","8","2","4","15 February 2017"," Scary reality
","This based of true story of Edward Joseph Snowden an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government, who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. Then he went to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over one month. Russian authorities granted him asylum for one year, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere. Even if a fraction of what is shown in the movie is true this is scary. There is no privacy left in the internet era. US government can see your whole history through your digital footprints. There is no limit or authorisition required. They do it with impunity and get away with it. Movie is top notch. The lead of Gordon Levitt and Shailene Woodley is superb. Direction of Oliver stone is very good. The movie captivates you and keeps you engrossed. Must watch."
"artmania90","7","2","4","1 February 2017"," An apt biopic
","Oliver Stone's SNOWDEN does exactly what a film about a whistleblower must do in order to be an effective thriller: sets up the story, sets up the motivation, and presents an opinion of the subject. It's still a fairly hot-topic situation, as Snowden's massive leak to the press regarding NSA surveillance only happened a few years ago. Though the film has a few flaws that surely hamper it's overall effectiveness, the general thought presented is that ""Ed"" Snowden is our generation's Karen Silkwood; a hero of unlikely background.<br/><br/>The film is structured in a sort of flashback, with Snowden's initial leak to the press in a small Tokyo hotel room lending itself to flashbacks of his life to this point. It's hard to imagine most people not knowing who Edward Snowden is at this point, especially considering a documentary surrounding his espionage just won an Oscar not 1 year ago. The film seeks instead to provide a backstory and shade the infamous man in a more human light - painting a portrait of what would lead a patriot to betray his beloved country.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt, I'll admit, has felt miscast in the past. He falls into roles greater than himself and fails to disappear into the character we see on screen. Surprisingly in ""Snowden,"" he actually succeeds. Deepened voice, loose-fitting clothes, and the slightest stubble, Levitt all but transforms in the role (all the more compelling when the film concludes with footage of the actual man and we barely notice that it is a new person). It's hard to classify his performance as someone who is sympathetic, but overall he does an effective job playing a man who finds himself in between a rock and hard place - that is to say the internal struggle he faces seems genuine.<br/><br/>The backstory we follow finds Snowden meeting his long-time girlfriend, first seeing her chat on an online dating site while in military training, and finally meeting in Washington after he begins working for the CIA. Played by Shailene Woodley, the girlfriend role oftentimes falls into the category of ""emotional obstacle"" and in several scenes she and Snowden fight only to keep the story juicy and the plot flowing. While good in the past (The Descendants, The Fault In Our Stars) Woodley is given very little to do in this film and tries her hardest to make the role her own.<br/><br/>I was very much impressed with the front-half of this picture, and I found the setup and introduction to our characters to be very effective. Snowden is initially hired on to work for the CIA and has some great scenes getting to know his supervisors and teachers (one of which is Nicholas Cage in a curiously-small role). We learn about who he is, how smart he is, and how his early work with the government would ultimately shape his story. It's too bad that the rest of the film fails to match the energy. Overly-clanky with flashbacks and flashforwards, it becomes fairly tedious to journey back and forth between present- day Tokyo to Hawaii or Europe or any variety of places in the States. Oliver Stone (co- screenwriter) had a lot of material to sort through, but it seems like the structure of the story was flawed slightly along the way.<br/><br/>I still praise the film, with it's strong leading performance and intriguing (albeit biased) account of this decade's most notorious government leak. Yes, the film makes it clear that Edward Snowden should be regarded as a saint - someone who uncovered mass conspiracy within our government and worked only to protect the USA's citizens. The movie serves as a supplement to the real man, and perhaps can help in forming opinions of whether or not his actions were ethical. Though Oliver Stone has made better films in the past, ""Snowden"" is still an effective biopic that warrants a viewing."

Thus, in his fairy tale narrative, Muslims are morally equivalent to all non-Muslim unbelievers in the world and never mind the fact that Muslims have been the archenemies of all non-Muslim unbelievers in the world ever since that menace to all non-Muslim unbeliever societies first evolved approximately 1400 years ago.<br/><br/>Hence, instead of acting swiftly to separate our two fully incompatible societies from one another completely, permanently, and forever and as common sense dictated in response to 9/11, that utterly unhinged loon, GWB, increased mass Muslim migration with all of its excess baggage and in which is really stealth demographic jihad to invade and infiltrate non-Muslim unbeliever countries in mass, by five-fold, and at the same time created the biggest federal boondoggle the world had ever seen when he created the gargantuan Department of Homeland Security to spy on all of us today.<br/><br/>Then he declared an exceedingly fantasy-based War on Terror that was preordained and doomed to miserably fail no matter what since even before it was first launched because it was premised on the fairy-tale that the horrible evil scourge of Islam is somehow a so-called Religion of Peace, morally equivalent to all true faith-based religions.<br/><br/>Hence, exactly like all things premise and based on a stupid stupid fairy tale, that incredibly fantasy-based so-called War on Terror has been miserably failing year after year to the tune already of over $8 trillion dollars and with no end in sight.<br/><br/>Anyway, my biggest criticism of the movie is they could have at least found someone far better looking to play the part of Snowden's girlfriend to give us, the audience, something far better to look at during the movie."
"myfearlessdragons","5","0","0","5 June 2020"," Just another biopic you do not need to see
","A troop of soldiers-to-be is quickly trudging through the woods, mindlessly humming something along the lines of the undying Mickey Mouse March, echoing so eerily and uncannily during the last shots of Full Metal Jacket. They march in concert, occasionally crawling through mud, being mercilessly yelled at, actively becoming a tiny cog in the boundless mechanism. One of these rookies is soon going to turn the world upside down; but for now he is just wearily inspecting x-ray of his fractured leg - there is surely so much to come. But, unfortunately, not for this movie.
The modern revolutionary, the inconspicuous face behind the Guy Fawkes mask, the public's key to the darkest government secrets, Edward Snowden is portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, who may have certainly caught your attention in Nolan's Inception as a smart-looking, sophisticated 'dream-catcher' and ""thought-snatcher"". Gordon-Lewitt also happens to bear a chilling resemblance to the modern swashbuckler and impersonates him well enough throughout the movie. However, this particular piece on cybersecurity, the fear of constantly being watched and the uneasiness of being disappointed in your beliefs and principles, is not convincing in the slightest and surely does not stand in the same line with many other works dedicated to Snowden's victories and hardships; Snowden (2016) seems artificial and downright tacky, especially when compared to true-to-life, realistic enough Citizenfour (2014).
The movie tries to tell the enchanting and enamoring story of how one single person can successfully fight against the terrifying machine. But I would be lying if I told you that this specific depiction has evoked any emotions in me, much less rage. Delectably tasteless, remarkably bleak and incredibly tiresome to follow: the plot is nothing less of a simple bore. The cinematographic style is likewise inconsistent and incomprehensible; some shots easily remind you of cheap music videos, while others try to express the character's feelings of perplexity and frustration, but succeed only in giving you an annoying headache. I did, however, recognize the barely visible influence of action-style filmmaking with the use of handheld cameras, that flourished so flamingly after the Danish Dogma 95 cinematic movement was formed and managed to stay in big cinema forever. You could imagine my surprise after learning that Anthony Dod Mantle himself, responsible for cinematography in Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Trier's Dogville (2003) and yes, Antichrist (2009), partook in the creation of Snowden (2016) too.
This rushed biopic, called for some reason 'a thriller' as well, inexplicably reminds of The Imitation Game (2014); the same blue and gray coloring, the same learning environment, the same atmosphere of a genius being born. But if The Imitation Game masterfully crafts a portrait of mysterious and immensely gifted Alan Turing, Snowden (2016) surely does not do justice to the real-life whistleblower. The latter comes out to be plain and one-dimensional, as if unable to feel any real emotions. Everything that surrounds the main character - from the make-believe NSA facilities to Snowden's menacing tutor as well as CIA Deputy Director (that 1984-mocking scene of him peering right into Snowden's soul surely did make me chuckle) to his life-size figure of a girlfriend, the setting does not seem to be believable, not even remotely.
Along with its countless gags and goofs inappropriate for a good hacker movie, Snowden (2016) makes rather for a nice laugh and nap, rather than a proper insightful story of a man who has hacked the government. No revolutionary spirit, no protest, no fight and awareness. Just a poorly done retelling of a unique story, with no eye-catching cinematography and futuristic editing to add.<br/><br/>5 suspiciously looking Rubik's cubes out of 10"

","Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the title role, is recruited to work for the CIA and soon realises that there are plenty of ""Un-American"" activities going on that he decides to leak to the press. The ""Wikileaks"" story is amongst the best publicised in recent years so there is little latitude the film can take with the chronology or facts. What it does do, though, is create a character in Snowden that is both torn and decent; not just with the responsibilities he faces at work, but with the impact on his family and long-time girlfriend (here, a rather better than usual Shailene Woodley) when he decides to spill the beans. That said, JGL really has to hold this up by himself - Zachary Quinto is terrible and neither Nicholas Cage nor Rhys Ifans add much beyond their names to the depth of the story. Clearly, much of this is supposition but it is certainly a thought-provoking attempt to question what we might do with information that is quite so condemnatory of our own ""free"" governments, if it were to come into our possession; or, indeed - should we ever become faced with the evidence of the comprehensive extent of the monitoring sub-culture that this film suggests may well exist across all of our communities."

","The only thing I know for sure after watching this film is that I don't know anything for sure. The only other time I was as conflicted about a real live event like Snowden's release of information about NSA surveillance was the uncovering of the Pentagon Papers during the Nixon era. That was supposed to jeopardize national security, but well after the fact, nothing really ever came of it. So even though the NSA was directed to clean up it's act, how do we know for sure? And now, we have Facebook under the gun for it's intrusion into the privacy of everyday Americans and the selling of information to any entity willing to pay for it.<br/><br/>What I CAN say about the film is that it was very well done. With Oliver Stone at the helm though, you have one more added element to consider regarding how accurate everything portrayed in it is, and depending on your ideological viewpoint, whether Edward Snowden, here portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, was a first class traitor or not. Again, conflicted at the outset when this story broke, I did indeed regard Snowden a traitor for releasing classified information, but as time marches on, one has to consider that he might have done the country a service by exposing the methods used by the government to spy on it's citizens (pretty much the same way the goliath tech companies do it without any oversight, although that day of reckoning seems to be coming).<br/><br/>So in this era of fake news and deeply divided partisanship, what do we really know? I'd like to think the movie was a fairly accurate portrayal of what occurred to convince Edward Snowden to do what he did, but with the spin doctors working overtime, I don't know that we'll ever find out. And I don't know If Snowden will ever clearly see the light of day again. This is a story that hasn't come to an end yet."

Where I fault the film is in stupid mistakes that could have been avoided with minimal research or fact checking. A prime example are all the basic training scenes where Snowden answers an Army Drill Sergeant by calling him sir. Absolute fail. Asking any of the vets at the any of the guilds (WGA, SAG, DGA, etc - including the craft services) about the use of ""sir"" in the various services would have cleared up this distracting mistake (an enlisted soldier is never called sir, while and enlisted Marine may be). There are many other factually inaccurate issues as well that only affect the story because they become a distraction. The distractions lower score of an otherwise really good film."
"Mike_Devine","7","0","0","22 July 2018"," Traitor or patriot, Snowden's story remains relevant
","Oliver Stone's storied career as a director is well known to many. Usually finding inspiration in subject matter that's within the political realm, he has a way of telling stories that usually end up causing a side of the aisle to get annoyed.<br/><br/>In 'Snowden,' we get a behind the scenes look at the shaping of the man who would go on to become one of this country's most infamous whistleblowers. While Edward Snowden is viewed by many as a traitor, and others as a patriot, it's clear there was a major transformation that happened to the former CIA agent as he experienced various events that gave him pause due to privacy concerns. We get to see this evolution, from a young man whose faith in government could not be shaken to a skeptic who went to great lengths to expose an intricate network of spy games.<br/><br/>While Joseph Gordon-Levitt has proven to be a fairly versatile actor to date, it's clear his resemblance to Snowden helped him get the part. Gordon-Levitt does a good job capturing his dry, shy demeanor, coming across as being authentic. There are also noteworthy performances from Shailene Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend from the other side of the tracks, as well as supporting actors Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto as the documentary filmmaker and investigative journalist duo who help Snowden tell his story to the world. In a dramatic thriller of this kind, these performances carry a lot of weight, and fortunately they are on point here.<br/><br/>What Stone does well here is telling the story through a series of important events in Snowden's career that help setup the rationale for why he did what he did. Everything is laid out in a very linear manner, and it works well here. While 'Snowden' is not intended to be a 'Jason Bourne'-style spy thriller, it is entertaining and interesting all the same, and still as relevant today as it was five years ago when it actually happened."

News feel like that 30 minutes with adverts in between, like a TV show.<br/><br/>""Verizon is hacking into all your phone calls"" is interpreted by the public as; ""Sure, but not my phone calls"". I mean here we are, ""reviewing"" on IMDb without a care as to what is being tapped into.<br/><br/>Films like Snowden and The Big Short, and and and, are important and more than just movies. Their topics are difficult to articulate perhaps, but, they transcend entertainment.<br/><br/>As a film however, Snowden was sluggish at points, but I do feel it did put in a concerted effort to simplify as best as it could, the applications and repercussions of the missions and actions in play.<br/><br/>This movie also kept unveiling some pretty serious star power I didn't know it had, and of that star presence, Zachary Quinto was the most quintessential.<br/><br/>Some aspects in Snowden were hard to follow; ""All this effing intelligence jargon is hurting our brains"". That line was so appropriate, true (Hell, it even gave Ed himself a seizure, and they called it ""epilepsy"") and incredibly funny, that it showed me that Snowden was self aware, however, amidst all that jargon, I understood one thing as it was mentioned; Going to Hawaii was OBVIOUSLY a TERRIBLE idea, if the aim was for Ed to have, ""less stress""!!!<br/><br/>Like I said, Snowden is one of those movies that, expose a truth that never really dies, no matter how much it's said that it has, and that is significant. And, in this movie, that story is illustrated quite efficiently, though a bit slow at times. 7/10."

","The eponymous Edward Snowden is, of course, the former CIA contractor who in 2013 revealed to the world the massive and unauthorised surveillance operations carried out by American (and British) intelligence services.<br/><br/>Documentary maker Laura Poitras was at the Hong Kong hotel when he passed on his information to the ""Guardian"" newspaper and this meeting was the centre-piece of her work ""Citizenfour"" (2014). In ""Snowden"" (2016), Poitras herself is one of the many real-life characters in Oliver Stone's film which opens in that hotel room but constantly flashes back to show how Snowden learned these secrets and came to the decision that he had to expose them. The two works complement each other neatly.<br/><br/>The casting for the Stone movie is well-done. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Snowden and, as well as having a passing physical resemblance to his subject, portrays convincingly the nerdiness, intelligence, passion and anxiety of the mother of all whistle-blowers.<br/><br/>Snowden's partner Lindsay Mills, who barely appeared in ""Citizenfour"", has a major role here and Shailene Woodley is excellent as the understanding and loyal girlfriend. Gay actor Zachary Quinto plays gay investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald. Other familiar faces include Nicolas Cage and – at least for UK viewers – British actors Tom Wilkinson, Rhys Ifans and Joely Richardson.<br/><br/>Only occasionally does Stone become carried away with overly-dramatic visuals. For the most part, this is a balanced and informative narrative, with good use of location shooting and some high- tech sets, in a film that underlines both the immense threat to our civil liberties and the huge price to be paid for exposing that threat."

","Why in the world is this rated over a 7? I guess we really do have a dumb population. The story would be half way decent if Oliver Stone actually hired someone to advise on the inner workings of the army, government, domestic vs. international espionage. etc. But no, we are left with Ollie's ridiculous conspiracy theories. You know, Oliver Stone knows it all these days.<br/><br/>Within the first 5 minutes you just have to accept that Oliver Stone has bought his own media raves from his early career and has parlayed that into movies that lack even the smallest effort (see Savages, yes, savagely horrible is what that was.). Then, like that isn't enough, on cue, Nicholas Cage walks into the movie. <br/><br/>Whatever you feel about the Snowden revelations (and I think the stuff about the domestic spying program coming out was a good thing), this movie is just expensive crapola for Oliver Stone to put out his own tin foil hat opinion. I could be fine with that, but the lack of effort to even gain some kind of understanding of certain things before you put them on film is just so blatantly cheap, and dumb, that this movie isn't worth the effort of watching. <br/><br/>All I know is that Joseph Gordon-Levitt always seemed like a decent capable actor, but this movie should be a negative in his career and whoever advised him to take the role should probably go back to Venezuela with Mr. Stone and stay."
"dave-mcclain","7","5","16","15 September 2016"," ""Snowden"" is an interesting, informative and well-told, but one-sided portrayal of the infamous NSA leaker.
","The story of NSA leaker / whistleblower Edward Snowden has been told before, but never like this. Books have been published, magazine articles have been written, songs have been sung, a graphic novel has been illustrated and even an action figure created depicting the man responsible for the biggest leak of classified documents in U.S. history. Then, of course, there are the movies. Documentaries on Snowden include ""Citizenfour"", which won the 2014 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. The highest profile feature-length drama to date about this highly controversial figure is 2016's ""Snowden"" (R, 2:14) starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and directed by Oscar-winner Oliver Stone, who based his screenplay on two books about his title character and had a series of meetings with Snowden while in exile in Russia.<br/><br/>Two days before the film's official U.S. release, in select cities around the country, special screenings were held, in conjunction with a live interview with the film's stars and director in New York, as well as Edward Snowden himself, via satellite from Moscow. ""The amount of care"" that went into the movie, said Snowden, ""is reassuring."" Stone acknowledged the complexity of the story, saying that it took quite a few visits with Snowden to get the details right. ""It took time to really absorb this stuff,"" said Stone. Gordon-Levitt, who does a great job of imitating Snowden's voice and mannerisms, talked about how Snowden's parents thanked him for his portrayal of their son when the actor met them at the film's New York premiere. For his part, Snowden discussed why he revealed the U.S. government's intrusive surveillance of its own citizens and others saying, ""Privacy is the right to the self."" That is what he feels that his activities have helped to protect. All these themes and more are on display in Stone's film.<br/><br/>The time and place that is at the center of the film is Snowden's discussions with journalists (played by Tom Wilkinson and Zachary Quinto) in a Hong Kong hotel room, as they all strategized about the release of the documents that Snowden took from the NSA site where he worked. All the while, filmmaker Laura Poitras (Oscar winner Melissa Leo) is capturing the video that she'll later use in ""Citizenfour"". As the group inches closer to the fateful moment of breaking one of the biggest stories of the decade, the film portrays periods of time in Snowden's life which eventually led to him hiding in Hong Kong, before going on to Russia. We see Snowden's Army training, his CIA training and service in Geneva and his employment as an NSA contractor in Japan, Maryland and, finally, at a top secret facility in Hawaii.<br/><br/>There were just a few constants during these experiences in Snowden's life. One of those was his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). Stone sees the portrayal of Ed and Lindsay's relationship as what kept the film from being ""a hard, cold movie which could almost look like a documentary."" We see Snowden mentored by his first CIA instructor (Rhys Ifans) and, to a lesser extent, by a CIA employee played by Nicolas Cage. The film also features Snowden's abiding desire to serve his country and his patriotism, which is what he says led him to expose the NSA's data collection programs. All of this serves to humanize Snowden. ""Until this movie, none of us really knew the story of Ed the human,"" said Woodley. Regardless of what you think about this man or the things he did while working for our government, what Woodley said is indeed what we get – a more human picture of Edward Snowden.<br/><br/>""Snowden"" is a well-constructed human story, albeit a one-sided portrayal. Aided by excellent performances, especially from Gordon-Levitt and Woodley, we feel like we get to know these characters and what makes them tick, as we follow Snowden's gradual transition from someone who completely supported his government's actions in the post-9/11 world, to a man who became disillusioned with the government's activities conducted in the name of national security. The script, co-written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald, gives us just enough of the computer activity to help us understand what's going on, but doesn't let us get lost in technical jargon (although there are times when the movie walks a very fine line). The political and privacy issues are well-addressed, but little attention is given to explanations of why the government did the things it did the way it did them, or the widespread repercussions of Snowden's actions. If you're looking to learn and understand more about Edward Snowden's story and the privacy issues he raised, or if you just want to see a well-written and well-acted drama-thriller, then this is your movie, but if you'd like a deeper or a more objective version of this story, keep looking.

","Greetings again from the darkness. I've never really understood the artistic benefit to filming a biography after a spectacular documentary on that person has already been produced, made the rounds, and racked up awards. But then, I guess the point has little to do with art, and more to do with economics (documentaries are historically a money losing venture). Renowned director Oliver Stone brings us the story of Edward Snowden just two years after filmmaker Laura Poitrus won the Oscar for Best Documentary for her Citizenfour.<br/><br/>Much of what Ms. Poitrus documented in real time at the Mira Hotel in Japan is re-enacted here as one of the three core story lines in Mr. Stone's film. To his credit, he fills in much of the backstory and Snowden's resume by starting with a failed attempt at joining Special Forces (tumbling off the top bunk is automatic disqualification if it shatters one's leg).<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt mimics Snowden's low key mannerism and measured vocals, while also fiddling with his eyeglasses during key moments. As a sought-after role for an actor, Snowden ranks a few rungs below, say Howard Hughes or Franklin Roosevelt or most any other person who has had an impact on America  just not much personality to work with – though his actions have created some of the most interesting discussions over the past few years.<br/><br/>Joining Snowden in the hotel room are Melissa Leo as Ms. Poitrus, Zachary Quinto as journalist Glenn Greenwald, and Tom Wilkinson showing off a Scottish accent as journalist (from The Guardian) Ewen MacAskill. The second storyline takes us through the initial recruitment and subsequent rise through the CIA and NSA, as we see how Snowden continually uncovered more about how the government was spying on citizens. His interactions along the way – such as Rhys Ifans as his CIA mentor Corbin O'Brian and Nic Cage as disgruntled agent Hank Forrester – provide a spark of energy on screen. The third piece of the pie revolves around Snowden and his politically-polar-opposite girlfriend Lindsay Mills, played by Shailene Woodley.<br/><br/>Since it's an Oliver Stone movie (he co-wrote the screenplay with Kiernan Fitzgerald), we fully expect his political views to be on full display. It's clear he is sympathetic and fully supportive of Snowden's actions, and does his best to paint him as a patriot who had no choice but to go public with his belief that the spying had nothing to do with terrorism, but was instead a form of social and economic control. Based on the books ""The Time of the Octopus"" by Anatoly Kutcherena and ""The Snowden Files"" by Luke Harding, the film portrays Snowden as increasingly disenchanted and disappointed, beginning in 2003 and moving through 2013.<br/><br/>Stone's feel for visuals come into play as we track Snowden through Virginia, Geneva, Hawaii, Japan and finally Russia. Along the route, familiar faces pop up in almost every new scene - Timothy Olyphant, Scott Eastwood, Lakeith Stanfield (Short Term 10), Logan Marshall-Green, Ben Chaplin, Ben Schnetzer, and Joely Richardson. There are a couple of sequences in which Stone applies his stamp  a party with drones hovering overhead (until they aren't), and an impactful full wall Skype with Rhys Ifans' face looming larger than Snowden's entire body.<br/><br/>Whistleblower or turncoat? Hero or traitor? Most people fall pretty clearly on one side of the debate, and there's no doubt where Stone stands. Just prior to the voice of Peter Gabriel over the closing credits and clips of the real Ed Snowden, there is a fancy edit where Stone shows him at his computer in his current home in Russia. Stone's movie makes a nice companion piece to Citizenfour, but if you are only going to see one, choose the documentary."

","What happened to Oliver Stone? Once upon a time you could sit down and watch a film, and knew he was the director just by the cuts alone, not to mention the atmosphere and over-all look of the presentation.<br/><br/>This doesn't look like an Oliver Stone film.<br/><br/>The script sounds like a Stone film. The plot is certainly an Oliver Stone plot. The subject matter and how it's handled is totally Stone. But the film, well, it's an Oliver Stone film.<br/><br/>The actors involved, well, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is certainly someone Stone would cast, but the long list of cameos of A and B grade stars comes down to a sprinkle and not a downpour like they used to.<br/><br/>And the look of the film, where are the Stone cuts? It looks like anyone in Hollywood could have directed the script and made it into the movie that it is.<br/><br/>The director doesn't leave his mark Snowden like he had on his earlier work. And, honestly, agree with his politics or not, the reason people go to see his movies is because he's directing them.<br/><br/>Snowden doesn't feel like he really directed it, and you walk away feeling robbed because of it. The movie would have been great with anyone else, but, honestly, we didn't want to see this film made by anyone else, we wanted to see it made by Oliver Stone."

Acxiom, buys more information on you than any other data broker. The FBI rarely needs to do any investigation on people, they just have a subscription and pull it up. Most of what the NSA collected was meta-data, just basically index cards to locate data. Granted, still the best way to link people with each other. Back to the movie, it's biased and fails to address the intercepted communications from the Taliban that he revealed. Seriously, why gloss over the stuff that was leaked on what everyone would agree they are supposed to be doing in combating terrorism.

","So often, in cinema, we are presented with people who are not, in fact, hero's but instead, little more than marketing ploys for a cause. Not so with Edward Snowden. <br/><br/>Snowden the movie, by Oliver Stone, shows us an example of a ""real"" hero. I man who has everything, a promising career, a loving girlfriend and a life in paradise. A man who casts much of his this life aside, for his principles. In this case to show the world the Orwellian surveillance state, that is growing, like a cancer, not only within the USA but also beyond its boarders.<br/><br/>Like many of Oliver Stones films, this one is beautifully crafted. Its inherently interesting material to start with certainly but its the deft screenplay, by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald that really brings this film to life. <br/><br/>Joseph Gorden Levitt, an actor, I have to confess I have paid little attention to, hands in a superlative performance as Edward Snowden. Indeed, all of the cast are to be commended. <br/><br/>So without belabouring the point, this is an excellent film.Its truthful and frank and Oliver Stone is to be roundly commended for making it.

That is, the state power overwhelms even the most brilliant individual. The image tacitly visualizes Orwell's ""Big Brother is Watching You."" <br/><br/>Snowden stands between us and that face of corrupt power, in that shot as he does in the film's overall warning about a federal government violating all principles and laws to spy unrestrained on all its citizens. <br/><br/>The face reveals he knows about Snowden's furtive conversations with his colleagues and even his unspoken private concerns, not just about the legality of the program but about his girlfriend Lindsey's fidelity. So complete is the government's invasion of the lovers' life that the face can assure Snowden that Lindsey hasn't betrayed him. its intended reassurance about her dissolves before the chilling revelation of the extent of the government's spying.<br/><br/>A program designed to track possible terrorists has turned into an uncontrolled invasion of even its' most trustworthy citizens' most private lives. The face ends the chat with a friendly line now turned sinister: ""I'll be seeing you.""<br/><br/>A few curt lines carry the film's gist. ""Terrorism is just an excuse."" Americans want security more than freedom. The full-screen images of computer programming represent a world that has lost humanity and traditional logic, that prefers the abstractions of logarithms and total power over its citizens over democracy. <br/><br/>Of course the current election figures in too. Trump is cited twice but looms implicitly in the threat of an elected tyrant who would exploit the total surveillance to consolidate his personal power. Hillary is heard twice condemning Snowden's crime. <br/><br/>That he committed a crime is undeniable. Where Obama's government shows its unfortunate (lack of) character is in refusing to consider his action as a whistle-blowing — that is, a crime that serves the public good — and insists on charging him with treason, which precludes an open, fair trial. <br/><br/>For once Oliver Stone's material is so compelling he doesn't have to juice it up with inventions and distortions. If he invented the Rubrik Cube ploy it's still an excellent metaphor for the gaming going on in the intelligence world — like the spying, a small game opens out into a mammoth one — and Snowden's particular genius. <br/><br/>Stone clearly intends to valourize Snowden. What he deliberately frames out of his discussion is his possible endangering of individual agents' and citizens' lives by his sweeping revelations."

","Whether one supports what Snowden did or not, this movie is watchable, well made and well acted. <br/><br/>Before this movie I wasn't that familiar with what he actually disclosed except that it was overreaching by the NSA spying on everyone including innocent people and friendly countries and their heads of state like Angela Merkel. Oliver Stone does a good job of showing Snowden's story from his beginnings in cyber security to his disillusionment. By the end of the movie the point is clear - the NSA was spying on people for reasons beyond terrorism like economic gain. And the point of the people disclosing the scandal is that invasion of privacy violates our civil rights and undermines freedom and democracy. Also cover up by the NSA CIA and the administration is shown. So the case in support of disclosure is made. For completeness I would have liked some characters arguing against disclosure like if the disclosures compromised terrorist surveillance and let the main characters rebut their arguments.<br/><br/>It helps to watch Citizenfour before or at least know what about the main disclosures because the characters speak very fast and sometimes the viewer can get lost during the technical dialog. Maybe some narration would have helped.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt now slightly older looking does a good job of imitating Snowden's voice and manner. He portrays him as calm logical intelligent and sure that what he is doing is right. Shaliene Woodley plays his loyal girlfriend Lindsay.<br/><br/>Nice on location filming around the world including Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Even for people who can't decide if he is a hero or not this eye opening movie make the viewer think about how much we are all being watched.

Until I saw the movie, I was unaware of the extent of the government's encroachment on individual's liberties. Now, the reality is more like the movies.

In what is now the most well-known disclosure of US intelligence and surveillance policies targeting unaware citizens, Edward Joseph Snowden has become the personification of what counterintelligence represents in the global arena.No matter what you think of Snowden's colossal exposure of classified documents to the world, this epic story of why he did it and how he pulled it off makes for a compelling and exciting film. It should be seen along with ""Citizenfour"" which provides less of the idiosyncrasies of Snowden's personality and more of his software genius as well as the motivation for his disclosures to Poitras, in particular.

","""Snowden"" is a co-production between France, Germany and the United States that resulted in an English-language movie from this year. It is the newest work by Oscar-winning writer and director Oliver Stone. The film runs for considerably over 2 hours and features Oscar winner and nominees as well as Emmy and Golden Globe winners and nominees. Not gonna go into detail about the names in particular, but you can check out the cast list for that. You will probably see many familiar faces in here, even if you maybe don't recognize them right away like Melissa Leo for example. The main character is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and he is in this film for the most part, actually almost every single scene from start to finish, except at the very end where the camera turns too the real Edward Snowden in a fairly cringeworthy attempt to make this an even more relevant movie. But it does not need to try so hard really because the subject of this film is relevant enough already with how little time has passed since Snowden uncovering the NSA details.<br/><br/>The film focuses a lot on this process of uncovering as major parts play in the hotel room where Snowden interacted with Laura Poitras (who won an Academy Award for her documentary on the subject) and the other reporters who made his story happen. But I must say I found these inclusions a bit off-putting as they switched so randomly between what happened in the past and the (then) present and the filmmakers' attempts to connect these different times weren't really successful and looked even pretty amateurish at times. What I did like, however, was how they brought in a more personal note with the help of Shailene Woodley's character. It may have been a bit too much and this was one of many areas where they could have cut parts, but I do believe these love relationship (struggle) parts were essential in making this film as it is as much about the private life of Snowden as it is about the professional life. The personal life parts (just some, not all of these) were among the best the movie had to offer and otherwise the scenes that managed to walk the fine line between being informative, but not too complicated about the subject, were the best the film had to offer, especially if a nice musical score came with these.<br/><br/>JGL was physically fine for the role and he also gave one of his best career performances, but I still think this was nothing too great to be raved about. The looks certainly were something that helped the actor in delivering from start to finish and he also got help from more experienced actors such as Nicolas Cage, even if they only play very small roles and don't have so much screen time like in his very case. All in all, it is a decent summary of the events in Snowden's tumultuous life in the last decade. I believe there are parts that the film could have done without and at 110 minutes maybe, or even 100, it would have been an even better watch. It is a bit bloated. And in general, I also think that the film offers very little apart from a decent acting moment (and Woodley) that you would not find in a competent documentary on the subject of Edward Snowden. But overall, it is still a decent achievement. There aren't many standout moments really and the film is definitely more ambitious than good, but as a whole it succeeds in telling an interesting story that also future generations should learn about. And from that perspective, I give it a thumbs-up."
"CineMuseFilms","7","3","10","25 September 2016"," bio-pic thriller about a principled romantic and modest hero
","Director Oliver Stone took a risk in making Snowden (2016). Not because of America's continuing legal vendetta against exiled Edward Snowden but because the definitive film about Snowden was already made in the multi-award winning documentary CitizenFour (2014). However, Stone's film goes beyond the act of whistle-blowing to explore who Snowden is and why he leaked. To do this, Stone incorporates the making of the 2014 documentary into his bio-pic thriller and adds a romantic back story to humanise the computer geek.<br/><br/>The Snowden plot line consists of known facts and a liberal dose of creative dramatisation. It is focused on the several days during which Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was holed up in a Singapore Hotel with journalists while legal clearances were obtained for media publication of his massive leak of classified NSA intelligence. During this time, there are several flashbacks to different points in Snowden's career that trace his progression from a rising star in the intelligence industry to his disillusionment about America's surveillance of enemies and ordinary citizens. While the Snowden story unfolds, the CitizenFour documentary is happening in the same hotel room, a clever device that adds authenticity. The flashbacks include scenes that could have been lifted from Eye in the Sky (2016) where American missiles zero-in on humans guided by cell phone signals. Surveillance technology has advanced to the point that almost anyone can be watched through common domestic devices, while agencies like the NSA publicly deny the scale of their spying operations. This is the hypocrisy that radicalised Snowden into blowing the whistle.<br/><br/>The clinical facts behind the Snowden story are alarming and their implications are so profound that most people cannot imagine, let alone articulate, what mass surveillance means for the future of democracies around the world. But we are talking cinema not politics, and Snowden tells a great story about an unusual individual. The back-story of his love life softens the narrative without melodrama and provides relief from the film's density of forensic detail. The two and a quarter hour long film could have been trimmed without harming the narrative but the acting and directing sustains the thriller edge of the story. Whether Stone's portrait appears too saintly or overly supportive of petitions to pardon Snowden is a matter of judgement. In any case, this is a well- made and engaging film that presents Snowden as a principled romantic and modest hero."
"Screen_Blitz","6","3","10","18 September 2016"," Oliver Stone's political biopic offers plenty of substance, but nothing remarkable
","Oliver Stone has a solid history of projects centering on controversial political subjects, dating back to his Vietnam War epic 'Platoon' in 1986. Though Stone has gotten share of formulating notorious events to life to the big screen, his latest project revolving on the controversial story of Edward Snowden, a former computer systems analyst who sparked a breakthrough in national security in June of 2013; proves that some stories don't translate well for on screen adaptation, at least not in the non-documentary territory. This biopic telling the story of the titular figure may offer plenty of knowledge leading up to the fateful moment that made global headlines along with some thought-provoking concepts about privacy and cyber security. Unfortunately, the film never reaches much depth beyond dragging us through a sluggish pace of humdrum storytelling, nor does it hit any dynamic roots that could have made for a more enthralling story. This film follows the true story of CIA agent Edward Norton (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who makes an disconcerting discovery of the government's collection of data containing communication info owned by every living individual around the globe, not limited foreign government or international terrorists. Upon this discovery, he gathers all the classified information he can get his hands on and leaks them online, leading to a massive controversy that made him a target by not the U.S government, but foreign government around the world as well. <br/><br/>Like many of Oliver Stone's projects, the film offers plenty of politically-charged commentary to the mix with plenty of scenes featuring protests against Iraq War and George W. Bush's presidency, the 2008 election of President Obama and his testimonies on homeland security; plenty of food for thought is thrown at the table. But when it comes to telling the story of Edward Snowden, the man who some called a ""hero"" while others condemned him as a ""traitor"" or a ""criminal"", that is where Oliver Stone's efforts falter. The storyline is intertwined by scenes of the titular character at a hotel in Hong Kong being interviewed by a documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras (who happened to direct the documentary 'Citzen Four -- centering on Edward Snowden) and The Guardian publisher Glenn Greenwald, played by Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto respectively. This is where we are let in on the events leading up to the critical event including his days working for the CIA, his pervasive paranoia upon discovering the massive mountain of communication surveillance held by the government, and his relationship with his girlfriend Lindsay Mills (played by Shailene Woodley). Throughout this time, the film feels the need to burn through nearly every single detail of Snowden's life including those of the least relevance; and what results is a sluggish pace of a story that's not as effective as it could have been. While there at least some fine tension in showcasing Snowden's paranoia against the government's access of private online information as well as credible performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley, Oliver Stone executes the story in a way that just isn't too effective or memorable. Though he manages to incorporate some engrossing concepts into the mix, his attempt on sustaining the story through a 134- minute don't quite come as satisfactory as it should have been.<br/><br/>Snowden is an average biopic that manages to display some fine performances by a likable cast and some moments of interest and substance surrounding it's controversial figure. Sadly, the film never rises to potential, nor does it make for a memorable portrait of the titular figure."

"howard.schumann","8","3","11","25 September 2016"," Further opens the debate between freedom and security
","In 1848, Henry David Thoreau wrote an essay that he called ""Civil Disobedience."" That essay expressed the view that when a person's conscience and the laws clash, that person must follow his or her conscience. Thoreau himself set an example by refusing to pay taxes as an act of protest against slavery and against the Mexican-American War. This idea of a citizen's right to disobey unjust laws has also been demonstrated in such events as the Boston Tea Party, the civil rights struggles in the South during the 1960s, Gandhi's non-violent revolution in India, the fight in South Africa against apartheid, and many others. <br/><br/>In that tradition, 29-year-old Edward Snowden, a former American intelligence contractor, leaked classified information to the press in 2013 that revealed the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) was spying on U.S. citizens. His action led to his passport being cancelled and his being stranded in Moscow where he has remained. If he returns home, he will be charged under the 1917 Espionage Act and legally prohibited from speaking to a jury about his motivations. Oliver Stone (""Platoon,"" ""Savages""), whose 1991 film JFK dramatized widespread doubts about the official version of the JFK assassination, is back with a hard-hitting docudrama about Edward Snowden. The film, simply called Snowden, was co-written by Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald and based on the books ""The Snowden Files,"" by Luke Harding, and ""Time of the Octopus,"" by Anatoly Kucherena. <br/><br/>It is basically a solid but conventional biopic that lacks the exhilarating pace of Stone's earlier films and does not provide any new information that is not available in Laura Poitras' Oscar winning documentary Citizenfour, but further opens the debate between freedom and security. The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Looper"") as the introverted whistleblower whose actions opened up a debate about balancing individual rights with the need for security. The film opens with a scene that those who have seen the documentary will be familiar with, the gathering in a Hong Kong hotel room of Snowden (Levitt), director Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo, ""The Big Short""), and Guardian journalists Glenn Greenwald (Zahary Quinto, ""Star Trek Beyond"") and Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson, ""Selma""). The tension is palpable as the young whistleblower shows them the proof of the illegal acts committed by U.S. intelligence in the name of national security. <br/><br/>The anxiety keeps building as they await the leak of the explosive material to the Manchester Guardian in England and Snowden fears he could be arrested or even killed at any time. The film then flashes ten years back to fill in Snowden's back story, including his relationship with his girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley, ""Allegiance"") and his brief military career where his training to be a Green Beret was cut short after a fall revealed two broken legs. Though he lacks the academic background, Snowden goes to work for the CIA, hired by fictional CIA instructor Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans, ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"") after impressive qualifying test results. It is there that he learns of secret surveillance of foreign governments such as the hacking of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone and the gathering of data on U.S. citizens whether under suspicion of terrorism or not. <br/><br/>He is disturbed when Gabriel, a hang-loose fellow employee, (Ben Schnetzer) allows him an unauthorized peak at a comprehensive NSA search engine called XKeyscore, and the ""optic nerve"" that can monitor every phone and computer or even the screen itself. The danger is there, Snowden realized, ""when everything you've ever done, every purchase you've ever made, everywhere you've ever traveled with a cell phone in your pocket is suddenly available to third parties."" When Snowden asks him about FISA (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) which requires a warrant for these types of searches, Gabe tells him FISA is simply a government-controlled rubber stamp for government surveillance.<br/><br/>The line is finally crossed for Snowden when he is asked to find derogatory personal data on a Pakistani banker (Bhasker Patel), and then compromise him by making a false report about his drunk driving. While credit must be given to Stone for tackling an important subject and Snowden definitely has a strong point of view, I have some reservations about the film's glorification of a man whose full story has yet to be told. It does succeed, however, in allowing a wider audience to hear Snowden's point of view about the abuses that can happen if there is too much emphasis is placed on national security at the expense of civil liberties. Snowden said, ""Privacy is the fountainhead of all our rights, from which all rights are derived. It's what makes you an individual. Freedom of speech doesn't have much room if you don't have the protected space."""

","Edward Snowden. Some may view him as a criminal for breaking the law and leaking secure information from the NSA, however the film took a more patriotic approach and portrayed him as a hero for revealing this information to the world. It's a very tricky subject. Did he have any right to go against his government and be considered a traitor? Perhaps, if it meant that the public knew that they were being spied on. Privacy is such an integral part of our interconnected lives, so my views may suggest that I agree with Snowden's actions...but as a self-proclaimed critic I shall remain unbiased. As a film, I thought Snowden was actually pretty well executed. Oliver Stone did a great job at balancing Edward's private life with his career which definitely made him more relatable as a character. I really appreciated the technical jargon, as a computer programmer I understood it all and felt like saying ""Yes! I could easily become a hacker!"". Alas, writing code in film is much easier than in reality...so my genius thoughts were shot down immediately. What really took me by surprise was the cast. ALOT of big names here that I wasn't expecting to see. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was perfect casting, took me a while to tune into his voice imitation of Snowden but I thought he was excellent. Rhys Ifans, Tom Wilkinson, Melissa Leo, Timothy Olyphant, Shailene Woodley (who's chemistry with Gordon-Levitt was slightly underdeveloped) and the one...the only...Nicolas Cage. Yes, stop what you are doing and gasp in revelatory excitement...Cagey boy, is in a good film. I thought the dramatic moments were tense, the plot was educational...all the elements for perfection were there. I just felt the structure was too basic and familiar. Nothing extraordinarily groundbreaking. It's a functional biopic and it succeeds in what it sets out to do. I couldn't help but think this was similar to The Fifth Estate...just better.

It's held by a few scared egotists at the upper echelons of power and the fear and paranoia pervade down through the entire system.<br/><br/>We need people like Snowden and other whistle blowers to hold the 'government' to account and it's impossible to know how much of a sacrifice such people have made in order to attempt to secure the freedom and liberty - such as it is - for the rest of us. It's when good men do nothing that evil prospers.<br/><br/>And so to the movie :-) <br/><br/>It's absolutely excellent, from the acting to the direction, editing, production, music - the lot! If you knew nothing about Snowden you'd approach it as a political thriller and you'd be engrossed. Even knowing the history, the movie and story move along at a cracking pace. It never drags, it's never dull or boring; it's always engrossing. Snowden's little speeches are eloquent throughout and it's impossible to come away from the movie without knowing that this guy did the right thing.<br/><br/>It's a thriller with a message. If not for people like Snowden we'd be on our way to 1984. Orwell may have got the year wrong but the prospect of Big brother looms larger now than it has ever done.<br/><br/>Watch it. Enjoy it. Learn. Remember."

","These type of recent true event propaganda 'questioning the government' based drama films have a very specific audience and won't be liked by most. It does require full attention to detail and most notable a certain interest in the subject matter. For those not very familiar with this news outlet upon the real story, may not be too interested. Having not been too familiar with the details of the actual story oneself, expectations weren't too high since I did not know much what to expect.<br/><br/>Snowden is a well crafted, directed and acted film. Joseph Gordon- Levitt is a star in his portrayal of Snowden as he makes the character more likable than he should be (which is a good thing). Shailene Woodley is also quite good in her role as Snowden's preposterous girlfriend. <br/><br/>The film isn't as gripping or suspenseful as it could have been but it is still quite intriguing and entertaining as a whole. Though this film may be considered quite a disappointment, in terms of box office success and critical acclaim. It very well felt like a blatant Oscar bait film and it received no love from the Acadamy. <br/><br/>The film was also a box office flop, only making $37 million worldwide on a $40 million budget, not too surprising considering this isn't a film which would do well in foreign markets, and since the reviews weren't that positive it was more than likely to flop. Another thing which hurt the film was it being rated R. They easily could have and should have toned it down for a PG-13 rating. With only one sex scene (which didn't show much) and a bit too many F-bombs, it wasn't as needed, which I think hurt it's box office. If the Social Network was able to get away with a PG-13 rating, Snowden should have been too. As being compared to the Social Network, Snowden isn't on that level, and is quite the disappointment. Though Snowden does make one think about real security in the end. Passable film but also forgettable."
"Lechuguilla","9","1","2","21 June 2017"," Riveting
","Oliver Stone knows how to make good movies. And ""Snowden"" is a good movie. From start to finish the film suggests a political thriller, comparable to ""All The President's Men"". With an overall tone of suspense and intrigue, the underlying theme here expresses the clash between citizen privacy and government spying by means of technology in the name of national security.<br/><br/>Of course Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is ""just"" a 29 year old computer geek who wears casual clothes and a backpack. How could he be a threat to the government? Well, in addition to being smart and having a conscience he happens to be in a position that allows access to sensitive computer information. He doesn't like what he sees; and he takes action.<br/><br/>Ed Snowden comes across as innocent, naÃ¯ve, and introverted. His girlfriend has an influence on him, and gradually changes his political point of view in a way that motivates his extreme actions.<br/><br/>The script is well written except for the continual use of flashbacks, which would normally render a jerky plot. Yet, the editing is so polished that the plot flows fairly well despite the flashbacks. Background music generally is somber and serious. Editing is terrific. Casting and acting are fine. At first I had qualms about the casting of Gordon-Levitt, based on movies of his I have seen. But here he gives a surprisingly effective performance in the title role.<br/><br/>Cinematography is acceptable, but I could have wished for more realistic production design. Computer control rooms and panels look a bit too futuristic in a Star Wars sense, for American government facilities.<br/><br/>""Snowden"" conveys a mood of justified paranoia. It reminds me of the film ""Silkwood"", wherein an ordinary person takes on a powerful institution. This underlying theme is almost always potent in the right directorial hands. Consistent with his past films, Oliver Stone has made a riveting, timely, and potent film."

In real life many of those who are appalled by the hero worship of Snowden try to say he is a traitor and leaked information that caused great damage. As the subject of this film is so topical and current, maybe the detractors can make a similarly engrossing movie showing the actual harm done by Snowden's leaks.

"bankofmarquis","6","3","12","21 September 2016"," Matter-of-fact and by the book
","SNOWDEN has all of the ingredients for a top-notch, Academy Award worthy motion picture - a ""ripped from the headlines"" plot, a multi- Academy Award winning Director and Writer (Oliver Stone), a charismatic rising star (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a truckload of strong supporting actors, many of whom have won Academy Awards themselves - Tom Wilkinson, Melissa Leo, Rhys Ifans, Zachary Quinto, Joely Richardson, Timothy Oliphant, Shailene Woodley and even good ol' Nicholas Cage.<br/><br/>So, why then, was this film so utterly boring?<br/><br/>You have to go back to the standard three legs of the film stool - Direction, Script and Acting (the 4th leg is Cinematography, but that wasn't one of this films flaws).<br/><br/>Let's start with the script by Oliver Stone and Kieran Fitzgerald. It had no range to it. The Edward Snowden character was pretty much the same at the end as he was at the beginning. The highs of the character were just slightly elevated from center and the lows were slightly lowered from center. The dialogue was the opposite of snappy (whatever that might be) and the emotional stakes just didn't exist.<br/><br/>The flaw in script and story could have been redeemed by a strong, charismatic central performance but, unfortunately, Gordon-Levitt's performance was anything but. He portrays Snowden as stoic and logical, never letting anyone see what he is thinking - including the audience. His scenes with Shailene Woodley (as his love interest) showed no spark or chemistry between the two, so when she decides to join him in his journey, I don't buy it. Gordon-Levitt actually, kind of, had chemistry with Rhys Ifans mentor character, but that character is shuffled to the bottom of the pile over and over again only to pop up on occasion to give wise advice. Most of the rest of the supporting cast were wasted in boring, overly intense roles. They looked like the were hired for their abilities to stare intently and seriously at a computer or television screen. Only Nicholas Cage and Timothy Olyphant rise above this weak script to give us something that resembled characters, but they are both on the screen way too briefly.<br/><br/>I lay most of the blame of this to the director and co-screenwriter. Oliver Stone's direction was middle-of-the-road (and I'm being kind), he films this in a palate of soft blues and greys with an occasional ""artistic shot"" thrown in for no apparent reason which separates us, the audience, from the action, not draw us in. He, clearly, has told all of the actors to ""tone it down"" and they all do to such an extant that I was wondering if they were awake.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem of this film, for me, was the climactic scene where Snowden decides to abscond with information. We know, from history, that he succeeds, but - unlike the recent SULLY where we knew how it would all play out and were gripping the arms of our chairs nonetheless - there was no tension in this theft and the aftermath. It was matter-of-fact and by the book.<br/><br/>Which is how I would describe the film. Matter of fact and by the book might make good CIA and NSA agents, but it makes for a very dull evening at the movies.<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars - the movie is, at least professionally filmed, - and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","Oliver Stone's Snowden is a story about an NSA whistleblower who's revelations about the Government's secret surveillance programs have shaken the public to it's core. It is a story of a man who willingly went against his country to initiate a change projected by the freedom of speech and information. During the summer of 2013 when all the information came to light, Ed's case was widely publicized as the vast majority of news channels and papers headlined his stories and discovery's. In 2014 Laura Poitras' Oscar-winning 'Citinezfour' carefully documented Snowden's account. Poitras, just like Greenwald, MacAskill & Gibson played an integral part in making Snowden's story come to life.<br/><br/>All of these characters feature in 'Snowden' and possibly through great acting as well as the relevance of the story, they are able to project the realism and tension that make this film demanding. Joseph Gordon-Levitt looks so much like Edward Snowden it's uncanny at times. He does an incredible job of replicating the person we see in all the documentaries and actual footages of Edward, yet his character still feels mechanic and robotic. It's not however Joseph's fault as Oliver Stone's script seems too shallow at times. Rather then portraying Ed's emotions and feelings, Stone's 'Snowden' looks a lot like a Hollywood version of 'Citizenfour'. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie Stone uses extensive crosscutting between various important events from Edward's past and the final days with the reporters in the infamous Hong Kong hotel room. The events that Stone shows act as a good summary of how Snowden has come to make the decisions he has made. However this feels repetitive at times. I'm afraid that 'Snowden' will not get much credit mainly due to the amount of information already made available by 'Citizenfour'. While Oliver Stone is undoubtedly a great storyteller, this story could have been told from a more human angle. There is no subjectivity in Stone's character. I have very similar thoughts about Robert Zemeckis 2015 movie 'The Walk' and James Marsh's documentary 'Man on Wire'. Funnily enough it also involves Joseph Gordon Levitt.<br/><br/>Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography is stunning and very fitting to how Stone tells the story. Employing mainly mid-range shots and taking time to establish the scenes, he gives the characters room to move around and act, while the 'mood' of the scenes differs drastically as we are guided through secret Government Intelligence locations, Hong-Kong hotels & Hawaii landscapes. Anthony knows exactly how to achieve impact and tension, employing similar techniques he used in 'Slumdog Millionaire', 'Rush' & '127 Hours'. <br/><br/>While Oliver Stone does an honest job showing some of the main pieces of Edward Snowden's story as well as projecting the 'Architecture of Oppression' that he faced, his script feels empty. In one of the scenes Snowden says that a lot of people cruise happily through life, why can't he? Unfortunately, we never get a chance to explore this question."

","Film director Oliver Stone is in a class by himself. He has dared to go into the political mine fields where only a few other Hollywood-based movie makers have ventured. Perhaps, the fact that the talented Stone was a Vietnam War U.S. Army veteran (1967-68), has toughen him up to take on the Establishment.<br/><br/>Earlier in his movie career, Stone caught a lot of flack for daring to challenge the ""official"" conspiracy version of how President John F. Kennedy was murdered in Dallas, in 1963, with his intriguing film - ""JFK."" His war-related dramas, ""Platoon,"" in 1986; and, ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" (1989), opened a wide vista for Americans to reflect on the horrific hell that is war. Incidentally, the ""Born on the 4th of July"" movie also proved that Tom Cruise could act! <br/><br/>Recently, Stone has been brave enough to also take on the Wall Street Bankers in two fine movies: ""Wall Street"" in 1987; and in 2010, ""Money Never Sleeps."" The Wall Street wise guys are the ones whose unbridled greed brought our America the draconian ""Financial Collapse of 2008."" <br/><br/>Enter, in 2016, Stone's ""Snowden."" It is a compelling movie about a young NSA whistleblower, Edward J. Snowden. It raises important Constitutional, national security and privacy issues which strike deep into the American psyche.<br/><br/>Snowden was a brilliant computer geek, whose career path led him first into the CIA and then the NSA. Later, he worked as a intelligence contractor, assigned to the NSA. <br/><br/>In 2013, Snowden revealed to the media, particularly the London-based newspaper, ""The Guardian;"" documentary-maker, Laura Poitras; and reporter, Glenn Greenwald, the massive global scope of the American surveillance state. Over the years, it had covertly devised ""a bulk data collection system."" That disclosure scene is set early in the film inside a hotel room in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Presently, at age 33, Snowden is residing in Russia, under an umbrella of temporary asylum, thanks to Vladimir Putin. The U.S. Justice department has a warrant out for Snowden's arrest, charging him with violating the ""1917 Espionage Act,"" and other related criminal offenses.<br/><br/>Stone's movie brings all of this suspense-filled drama to life. It jumps back and forth between Snowden's 2013 disclosure to the media in Hong Kong; to his short-lived life as a U.S. soldier; his hiring by the CIA/NSA; his sometimes rocky relationship with his girlfriend; to his awakening - a la Saint Paul on the road to Damascus - that there's something morally, legally and profoundly wrong with how his country was gathering intelligence on its citizens. <br/><br/>As Snowden, Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a stellar performance, that is worthy of an Academy Award nomination. He masterfully shows him as a conservative, shy, goody-goody, cyber wizard, and supra-hacker dude, who when not playing with his Rubik's Cube, finally wakes-up to his part in the world of insidious surveillance. <br/><br/>(Shailene Woodley) is brilliant in the part of Linda Mills, Snowden's girlfriend. She knew how to turn the heat up in their bedroom scenes and to play the role, when required, of the wounded female. (Melissa Leo), whom I loved in Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana's ""Homicide: Life on the Streets,"" is at the top of her game in portraying Laura Poitras.<br/><br/>(Rhys Ifans) gives a memorable, first-rate performance in the role of Corbin O'Brian, Snowden's CIA mentor. (Zachary Quinton) was cast as the hard-nosed reporter, Glenn Greenwald. He brings the added intensity needed to give the movie some dramatic edge. <br/><br/>Bringing up the rear in this very capable Snowden cast, is none other than the seasoned actor, (Nicolas Cage), as a crusty CIA functionary, Hank Forrester. Cage is very credible, and low-keyed, in that relevant role. <br/><br/>By the way, the real Greenwald, on September 16, 2016, blasted the ""Washington Post"" for ""towering cowardice"" for calling for Snowden's prosecution. Ironically, it was one of the newspapers that first carried Snowden's whistleblowing revelations and it even won a Pulitzer Prize for its stellar reporting. Go figure!<br/><br/>Other government whistleblowers, such as the courageous Thomas Drake, had previously shown Snowden the way forward on this matter. <br/><br/>The U.S. government doesn't see Snowden as a mere whistleblower. It has labeled him a ""traitor. It wants to burn his ass! This includes elements within the U.S. intelligence community, President Barack Obama, a majority of the U.S. Congress and the hawk-ridden ""Washington Post."" <br/><br/>""Big Brother"" is looking to bring Snowden down and down - hard. Shades of author George Orwell's prophetic ""1984.""<br/><br/>To check out just some of the classified intelligence programs, that Snowden has exposed, see, ""The Intercenpt"" website.<br/><br/>To learn more about Snowden's current status, and his bid for freedom, go to this Snowden-friendly website, at:<br/><br/>Snowden is now a man without a country. <br/><br/>If you care about your federal government spying on you, go see ""Snowden,"" and, if inspired, then follow up by contacting your elected representatives on Capitol Hill with your concerns.<br/><br/>I'm giving Oliver Stone's ""Snowden"" ten out of ten stars."

Although set in a hotel room, this story is anything but static. It deals with issues that are directly relevant to every American and to all people everywhere. This movie is intense and takes the audience on a trip into the inner workings of some of the most secret agencies inside the government. One person does something that actually changed the world. His actions brought to the public's attention a whole bunch of stuff that was going on under wraps and gave them an immediate transparency that was both disturbing and refreshing.

In some cases it was distracting and took away from the scene. Unfortunately, it was overall bland or boring and very forgettable.<br/><br/>The score seemed safe to me. I didn't hear anything inherent from this sound track or even from the sound design of the film which is a big let down. This film is so heavy on dialogue where it could have relied on sight and sound to convey a message to the audience especially when the film is about espionage. Even the high ceiling camera angles made to look like security cams didn't do much for the film.<br/><br/>The acting roles were not up to par and I do not blame the actors, I blame the writing. I felt like they were limited to a script that wasn't very strong to begin with. Shailene Woodley's character was hard to grasp with no back story and their relationship didn't seem to make much sense in the beginning but eventually the chemistry between them grew on me and was more believable.<br/><br/>Lastly, the movie was very long and drawn out.

","This review of Snowden is spoiler free<br/><br/>*** (3/5)<br/><br/>SOMETIMES IT SEEMS that the phrase ""too soon"" doesn't apply and doesn't have a proper meaning when it comes to big-screen adaptations of politically charged global scandals. As it wasn't long ago that we got WikiLeaks' name-making Guantanamo Bay files, of Benedict Cumberbatch slipping on an extended Malfoy-esque wig for The Fifth Estate. And also Leonardo DiCaprio has already optioned an unpublished book on Volkswagen's 2015 co2 emissions cover-up. And now – only three years after Edward Snowden's NSA revelations – here comes director Oliver Stone's bold, rather ambitious and surprisingly thrilling relevant biopic of the government analyst-turned-whistle-blower for The Guardian. For years director Oliver Stone now 70 – was a cinematic sleeping giant who used to be known for creating the exceptional over-the-top war pick Platoon, but it seems he had his work cut out for him recently as his last film the not-so thrilling action/crime/thriller Savages seemed to have quite an extended reach as the filming ran away from him while creating that. <br/><br/>In, Snowden we open in 2013, in a hotel in Hong Kong, with journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto) and documentarian Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo) as they nervously await for a special rendezvous with Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who arrives with an all manner of dirty secrets to spill about how he pulled of that superfluous scandal only a few months before. Next, we flashback to 2004, where Snowden is a medically discharged special forces recruit who washes up in the CIA's rather large cyber branch, and an intercut timeline helps thread a link that was much needed between the past and the present, hopping back and forth between Snowden's career and his twitchy current existence, hiding in his hotel room to get away from the people who are constantly chasing him. Though the time-jumps between these timelines may be simple but they are an effective narrative device for showing Snowden's former life as a pro-Dubya patriot – which adds to the emotional story heft of his dubious decision to reveal the Big Brother-ish extent of the US government's spying game. Unfortunately his global tour – encompassing governmental jobs in mainland America, Switzerland, Japan and Hawaii – can occasionally be sadly episodic which is a giant put off for the story as not much happens at the point. <br/><br/>Though its essential stuff as it is just used as foregrounding of his tempestuous relationship with professional photographer girlfriend Lindsay (Shailene Woodley in her best performance ever) acts as a solid narrative spine which manages to keep the story held together and now casts Snowden as an alternative love story, something that's crucially needed for something like this. However it's not like this story is light on sweaty-palmed drama and provocative politics so there is plenty to enjoy. Late on, Stone expertly wrings extensive tension from little more than a loading bar and a hidden SD card. Although, some of the director's illustrative tools are occasionally blunt as there are points when the story goes a little schlocky and seems to run away with itself – as one of Snowden's first epiphanies concerns a supposedly inactive laptop camera filming a Muslim woman removing her traditional veil – his anger at the rapaciousness of post-9/11 surveillance comes out eloquently and is nicely detailed. <br/><br/>To help the film even more Stone's assisted by an in-form starry cast, too. Woodley lights up every scene she is in with electrifying execution, Rhys Ifans sells his look as a quietly sinister father figure to Snowden and finally Gordon-Levitt grows into a performance that initially seems mild mannered as his world is changing around him. The real-life Edward Snowden, (two years younger than Levitt) is still an exile in Russia, and he was consulted heavily and a third act decision to show off this admittedly impressive access seems as rather ill-judged take for the director. In fact, there's a heavily pervading sense that potentially takes interesting avenues(Snowden's self-interest, with the consequences of his international fame) are ignored in favour of an overwhelmingly heroic, almost saintly, character arc. Though the film flags a little and doesn't rein as supreme as other films based on professional hackers (if you can call that a profession) Snowden is a capably delivered thriller that's as powerful as it is pertinent. <br/><br/>VERDICT: Snowden is a bold, ambitious and sometimes risky tale about government agency whistle-blowers that bravely doesn't point out too many names or technically speaking doesn't point too many fingers, and pulls a rather thrilling thriller that's strong powerful enough to be potentially Oscar worthy. <br/><br/>6/10 not so supreme."

","Having little knowledge about the facts surrounding the Snowden controversy, this film does a good job at showing the rise and fall of Snowden. While I appreciate that the filmmakers made this film (I'm surprised there was no move to stop it from being made), it does incorporate an extensive amount of American propaganda.<br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt does an absolutely amazing portrayal of Snowden. Not only does his look change (Gordon-Levitt as an actor vanishes as the movie goes on), but the way in which he trained himself to imitate Snowden's speech is incredible. While it isn't exactly 100% the same, it is quite close. Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend (this is a very man heavy film) is quite annoying. I don't mean Woodley herself, but the way her character is presented really set me off. Maybe the real Lindsay is like that, but the way the film made her out to be such a dumb blonde really peeved me. Even after first establishing that she knows a bit of code, and HTML, they just make her redundant, and solely an object of desire for the protagonist. <br/><br/>Additionally, while I like how the film is organized in its storytelling, there was too much American propaganda added towards the end. After displaying all the outrageous things organizations are able to do with the click of a button, the movie doesn't hold them accountable. They aren't portrayed as the bad guys, even though they are saying that these organizations should not be crossing those lines. Instead, they are saying that this happens, and that the public should be aware about it. But, that they still love their country. <br/><br/>Another thing that really made me question the credibility of the whole fiasco, was the ending scenes with the real Snowden just posing in front of the camera. For a long time. In different angles. Turns out he might be an attention seeker after all."

","Snowden may be Oliver Stone's least controversial movie.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a gripping, topical portrait of the era's most renowned techno-Robin Hood figure, whose whistleblowing rocked the world, critiqued as either an empowering exposé of unconscionable government overreach, or as unpatriotic treason. It's a suitably robust subject for the director who has cinematically rattled the cages of two U.S. presidents (one still in office), and mapped out an exhaustive conspiracy treatise of the assassination of a third. And perhaps it's just that - the film practically writes itself, and its execution leaves the same nagging tickle of there being preciously few surprises along the way. But Snowden isn't a film with surprises on the brain - the brazen violation of the NSA's global surveillance he publicized is shock enough. It's a film that plays up the familiarity of its sordid subject matter as a taut, playfully Orwellian 'political thriller.' And it's all the more deeply unsettling and necessary viewing for it. <br/><br/>It's immediately apparent that Stone isn't too bogged down in solemn moralizing to have a little fun. Relishing in the exposure and expectations of entertainment even in an issues-driven film, he has a ball satirically aping the slick cinematography and pulse-pounding tension building of Hollywood spy, action, and heist genres (there's a future drinking game of 'spot the Captain America references' afoot, though goofy, out-of-place Nic Cage is disappointingly/necessarily restrained). You can practically hear Stone snickering behind the camera as Rhys Ifans (even more silkily reptilian here than in The Amazing Spider-Man)'s sinister NSA mentor - ""O'Brien,"" naturally - looms over Snowden from a gigantic video screen in a hooting Orwell tribute. Why? To slyly draw out the disconnect of the age-old Hollywood escapism being applied to a disturbingly real context, of course. Snowden's thesis is that the NSA's involvement in public lives is so outrageously evil, it must be true. <br/><br/>Still, this flirtation with Hollywood thrills isn't just enjoyable - it also helps offset the exposition density of Stone's script, which barrels ahead with full JFK-manifesto steam, rendering the complicated and controversial context crucially comprehensible. Granted, we do lose some nuance of the why and how Snowden's work with the NSA both exposed and contributed to unprecedented extremes of surveillance and privacy violation in the name of national security. Other interludes are cheerfully, transparently fictionalized (Snowden's savant level entrance exam to the NSA, and overseas spy missions that no computer technician would be trusted with). These may feel inevitable in the interests of running time and genre, but remain problematic, blurring the divide between escapist Hollywood fable and devastating reality. <br/><br/>And there's the rub: positing the film so blatantly as mouthpiece of Snowden's side of the story - literally by the end - fumble somewhat the crafting of Snowden the character. Naturally, the volcanically opinionated Stone has no pretences of objectivity, but Snowden is a somewhat bristling reminder of Stone's monolithic, old school romanticism. His script overworks to position Snowden as an earnest paragon of Jim Garrison 'Murrca, anchoring beats on his Ideals, Torment (Snowden's epilepsy is treated as one more hurdle for him to stoically overcome), and relationship with a good woman he loves but who can't understand his Commitment to the Cause (Shaileen Woodley; spunky and charismatic beyond her tiresomely thin 'suffering love interest' archetype). There's no denying, political biases aside, that Snowden's actions showed unbelievable courage, competence, and integrity. Still, witnessing Anthony Dod Mantle's lilting cinematography and Craig Armstrong's score practically swoon over him like stylistic refugees from an unchecked Steven Spielberg film is enough to make even the most ardent supporters reel. <br/><br/>A more interesting, nuanced take would've poked more deeply at Snowden's ideological slide from his initial, more libertarian leanings, to his investment in the Obama administration would repeal the dubiously ethical 'counterterrorism' espionage policies Snowden immediately sniffed out (though Stone does evocatively capture the rapture of hope of Obama's election day), to his eventual exposé (Stone thankfully, resists any turning point epiphany clichés). Instead, Stone truncates the narrative through temporal cross-cutting to the present, with Snowden imparting his story to a trio of harried journalists (Zachary Quinto, Tom Wilkinson, and Melissa Leo, all of whom generously brew tension), which saddles the film with a disappointingly choppy, 'clip show' biopic rhythm. Still, for a film facilitating such a crucial cultural conversation in such an urgent, accessible fashion, these faults, none the least being Stone's peppering of cheeseball metaphors (the instantly stale motif of Snowden repeatedly photographed by his girlfriend; a laptop camera transfiguring into a leering eye), are easily forgivable enough, though they do cost the film the crisp timelessness of an All the President's Men, or even the more recent The Social Network. <br/><br/>That said, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's casting is the make-or-break that lends the film its soul. Beyond his uncanny vocal mimicry, Gordon-Levitt digs into the core of Snowden's fierce idealism, working wiry charisma out of his steadfast competence, and the agonizing isolation of his inability to vocalize his concerns over his own workplace's actions. He may be too boundlessly likable to play Snowden as enigmatically as he'd like (though his bursts of curt selfishness - ""I wanted power, prestige, and to live in Japan"" - are effective), but his quieter moments - allowing flecks of doubt to cross his eyes, or his jaw to subtly tense - demonstrate a commendably committed performance easily worthy of his subject's celebrity mystique. <br/><br/>Teasing Hollywood pastiche and schmaltzy romanticism aside, Snowden is at its strongest when, like its subject, it sticks to its issues. Future takes may tap into the ripple effects of Snowden's whistleblowing with greater nuance and less bias, but, as an impressively entertaining manifesto informing viewers as to the issues, ethics, and disturbing nonchalance of the United States' counterterrorism overreach, Stone's film is as focused and clear-headed as they come. If there's one good example to take from the NSA, it's this: Snowden is essential to watch. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"
"Troy_Campbell","6","2","9","23 September 2016"," A flawed but thought-provoking biopic.
","Oliver Stone hasn't made a film in the new millennium that comes even close to rivalling his pre-2000 output, but this topical biopic is a great step in the right direction despite featuring some narrative clichés and cardboard cutout characters. Set during the tumultuous few days Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was hiding in Hong Kong with journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto – a scene stealer) and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras (Melissa Leo), the story is predominantly relayed through flashbacks to varying degrees of success. The movie conveys the complex cyber world in a comprehensible and visually interesting manner however there's a fair bit of melodramatic flab that could've been cut, particularly the wearisome scenes exploring Snowden's relationship with flighty girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). The eponymous whistle-blower is fleshed out extremely well though, thanks in large part to the uber-talented Gordon-Levitt who delivers a multi-faceted portrayal of a ferociously intelligent and patriotic geek who wants to serve his country with pride and distinction. Unfortunately the swathe of recognisable faces surrounding him are given very little to work with. Rhys Ifans is stereotypically shady as a CIA boss, Timothy Olyphant is a one-dimensionally immoral field agent, Melissa Leo and Tom Wilkinson are cookie-cutter journos and Nicolas Cage is, well, Nicolas Cage. Where big points are scored is with the visual style, Anthony Dod Mantle's dynamic cinematography full of intense close ups, sharp zooms and kaleidoscopic lensing, all combining to create a sense of immediacy and intimacy. Stone's direction is impassioned and propulsive, albeit a little ostentatious on occasion, but his biggest failure is not reigning in Craig Armstrong and Adam Peters' overbearing and unnecessarily manipulative score. A solid biopic on a controversial figure who still splits opinion, Snowden is undeniably flawed and overlong yet is also informative, thought provoking and often times rousing."
"sean_footynut","7","2","9","26 September 2016"," interesting story, Gordon-Levitt portrays Snowden well, but is he a hero or villain?
","Is Edward Snowden a Hero or a villain? Did he need to tell the world about what the American security agencies were doing? It's up to you to decide when watching Oliver Stone's new historical thriller, Snowden. <br/><br/>The narrative is structured around a back-n-forth mentality, taking us from the 'present day' to the past. The film opens with Snowden meeting up with the journalists that helped him expose classified surveillance information to the world. All 3 journalists portrayed in the film were in the Oscar winning documentary 'Citizenfour' director Laura Poitras, featuring Guardian Journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill. They are trying to gain the information from him before he is captured and this is how we are introduced to how Snowden obtained the information. Using flashbacks we go back to different stages through the time period of 2004-2013, as we are taken from his short time in the army before 2 broken legs saw that career ended, into his CIA training before we head into the nitty gritty stuff that Snowden was doing for the CIA and NSA.<br/><br/>Snowden is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and is joined by Shailene Woodley (Snowden's Girlfriend, Lindsey Mills), Melissa Leo (Poitras), Zachary Quinto (Greenwald), Tom Wilkinson (MacAskill), Rhys Ifans (CIA Mentor, Corbin O'Brian) and we are also treated to a cameo from Nicolas Cage, who plays a caretaker of old computers at the training facility Snowden attended. Adding a bit of humor to the film as few directors would put Cage into the bowels of CIA Headquarters. <br/><br/>Stone delivers another post 9/11 political thriller, although at times it doesn't feel like a thriller, more just a dramatization of facts and theories on the story of Snowden. This is its down point, as we don't know what is actual fact and what is fiction. One scene in particular is hard to establish if it is real or just a dramatization. There are blurred lines through many of the scenes as you try to establish fact from theory and it takes away from the film. <br/><br/>Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of Snowden is well done as he nails all the personality traits of the real life Snowden. He speaks in low, brainy tones, which is very similar to how Snowden speaks in real life and brings all the mannerisms of a man who is a computer genius. But you can avoid the feeling that this Snowden is portrayed in a warm manner. Stone shapes Gordon-Levitt's Snowden to feel complex and human, allowing the viewer to connect with him on an emotional level, therefor making us feel sorry for the man that thought he was only doing the right thing. Which in my opinion was. Stones shot choices when Snowden is exposed to what the American government agencies is doing enables us to see that Snowden is horrified by this, therefor making us also feel horrified at what we are seeing on screen. Every time Snowden is exposed to something new relating to the NSA spying on the world's citizens adds to his argument of Snowden was just being the hero, and you may begin to portray him as a hero or a traitor, depending on how you perceive this film.<br/><br/>Overall it is an interesting story that is well crafted to express the story of Snowden and give us a new take on how to perceive the whistle-blower. Do we see him as a hero or do we see him as a villain. For me he is a hero."
"jdesando","Null","2","9","21 September 2016"," It's real, and its exciting, and it's Oliver Stone.
","""The modern battlefield is everywhere."" Corbin O'Brian (Rhys Ifans) <br/><br/>The most celebrated whistle blower in history, Ed Snowden, is played as an introverted egghead by the accomplished actor, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, directed in Snowden by the accomplished Oliver Stone. Less subjective than Stone's JFK, this fascinating docudrama seems spot on, especially if a viewer has seen the well-done documentary on the same subject, Citizenfour (2014).<br/><br/>In this dramatic rendition of the events leading to Snowden's being accused of espionage by the US for revealing the bulk surveillance of American citizens by the NSA, Snowden is resolute exposing the violation of the Fourth Amendment while he acknowledges the cost to him and his loved ones. Except for an over-the-top, slightly sinister CIA instructor, Corbin O'Brian, characters are realistic and under played, not always characteristic of an Oliver Stone film.<br/><br/>Although Edward Snowden has the low-key personality of Sully Sullenberger of the United Airlines Hudson River landing, like Clint Eastwood's docudrama Sully, there is something strong and heroic in what they do, both ending up saving life and liberty for American citizens. As with Sully's wife, Snowden has the requisite suffering lover, in this case Lindsay (Shailine Woodley), but this time the footage spent with the lover makes sense to show Snowden's humanity and the difficult choice he must make.<br/><br/>After all, a posh job in Hawaii and a beautiful lover would make any man pause before he upended his life to preserve the personal freedom of his fellow Americans. Bur Stone gently lets the audience identify with the heroics and makes a 2 ¼ hour film seem both short if you like the intrigue and long if you don't like the love scenes. It could be argued that the film is too long, but given that limitation, it works like an exciting spy story whose ending we know but whose innards we happily experience for the first time.<br/><br/>Unlike Stone's previous head bangers, Snowden gently lets you decide if Edward Snowden is patriot or traitor."

War is absolutely inhuman as has been floated by movies about Enigma and how when the decrypted it they mostly could not use the encryption for fear of letting the enemy know their codes had been broken.<br/><br/>Nothing, no movie, including this one has every done a serviceable job explaining why the world system has to be based on war, nor why there are not continuous efforts to work towards peace. The whole opaque system is what Snowden is against I believe.<br/><br/>As a movie to get people thinking, and maybe fortify them with motivation to watch the full length of ""Citizen 4"" this movie is one of the few movies made in years that has any use other than simply mind-numbing entertainment, so for that I'd like to give it a 10/10 ... it just simply fails at that ambition even though it was superbly well done.<br/><br/>Thanks Oliver Stone, and I hope you continue making political movies and documentaries."

They convince Guardian editor Ewen MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) to print sensitive documents stolen by Snowden that implicates the US government in the widespread spying on the American public. Snowden was discharged from the military for medical reasons. He was an Ayn Rand loving Republican who served in the CIA. The highly skilled programmer has a long winding successful career but the unchecked intrusion starts to concern him. His stress affects his relationship with liberal girlfriend Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley). Eventually, he copied the files and smuggled them out of NSA.<br/><br/>There are some good information but Oliver Stone fails to make me root for Snowden no matter how hard he tries. And he tries very hard. JGL creates a naive true-believer who grows to hate the corruption of his work. Obviously, Stone has a point of view and is pushing a narrative from Snowden's side. I don't have a problem with that but he has to recruit my sympathies. In the end, a couple of his arguments rang hollow. JGL's mimicry of Snowden does not help. He has a flat speaking voice with some minor autistic tendencies. It's not like the general public knows his voice so it's not really necessary. The information is good but public affairs have overtaken his story. It's almost quaint at this point."

","Working for the United States government, as with any job, has both pluses and minuses. First, governmental work especially involving the National Security Agency gives their employees security clearance and access to the United States undercover information. While this top-secret information may be fascinating to know, this knowledge comes with a great responsibility and trust. Even if you don't necessarily agree with what the government is doing, it is your job to perform and execute to the job description or how it is outlined by your supervisors. ""Snowden"" directed by Oliver Stone is a movie based off of a real life story when Edward Snowden, a contract worker for the National Security Agency, leaked top-secret information about the United States government's tactics of surveillance to news agencies because he didn't agree with what the United States was doing and wanted people to know about what was happening. Some people believe Snowden's actions were a public service and people should know what the government is doing to keep track of them whereas others think that Snowden is a traitor to the United States. Despite the controversy surrounding Edward Snowden's leak of this information, the movie ""Snowden"" portrays his actions as a public service to citizens rather than betrayal against the government. The movie is told in retrospect of Snowden looking back on his whole experience working for the government as he tells the press what happened. Through these series of flashbacks, Snowden is able to illustrate his point of view about what the government is doing. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the actor playing Edward Snowden in the movie is a very respectable actor whose appearance and demeanor resemble Snowden and is well cast. Thus by casting Gordon-Levitt, the very second the audience sees ""Snowden"" they sense a familiar face and safe feeling. The film begins with Snowden's life prior to employment at the National Security Agency. Early scenes include his military training before being discharged secondary to his lower extremity injuries, education prior to entering entering the Central Intelligence Agency as well as meeting his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills. These scenes show different emotions and characteristics of Snowden. Through this backstory, the viewer is able to see Snowden's background, which helps the viewer to see him as a fairly ""regular"" moral U.S. citizen. Ultimately, including these scenes was a strategy in helping the viewer ""bond"" with Snowden. The movie's story line then builds to the conflict. Snowden is exposed to various government secrets and the ways the government keeps tabs on people. Snowden has a realization in the movie that citizens are treated more like objects sitting in a database than real-life human beings with rights that should be protected, not exposed by the U.S. government. Intense and emotional scenes show how much Snowden was grappling with what to do-- he was so deeply bothered knowing this yet did not want to betray his own country. Many people surrounding Snowden in the movie, were not too bothered by what was occurring, which further emphasizes the director's goal of making Snowden a hero. Once, Snowden releases the information, he flees America for protection from the U.S. government. During the last scene, the director cuts from from the actor playing Snowden, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, to the real Edward Snowden. The resemblance between the actor and the real Snowden, the smooth transition, and the whole idea behind the last shot really make the movie seem real to the viewer. This was an interesting twist, not usually used in movies, but was well done and seemed effective and intriguing. Overall, this movie was a way for Snowden to share his story with the world, while he is in hiding in Russia, without censorship or influenced by any authority. He was able to tell his side of the story without rebuttal about how the government was keeping watch on innocent U.S. citizens. Although many of Snowden's points may be valid, this movie was biased and looked at the issue from only one point of view. The movie did not fully acknowledge how much the government is able to do with this information it gathers in terms of the public safety. Snowden makes U.S. citizens question the role of government in protecting individuals as well as also makes people wonder about the level of loyalty and morality government employees must have and maintain and to what extent."
"sddavis63","7","1","3","6 January 2017"," Hero Or Traitor?
","I watched this movie with no real stake in it. I'm aware of Edward Snowden and have a little bit of familiarity with what he did, but I don't really have a position on whether he's a hero or a traitor. The perspective of this movie is clear. Directed and co-written by Oliver Stone, it's hardly surprising that the film falls on the ""hero"" side of that question. And, to the extent that the movie is an accurate portrayal of events, that's certainly an arguable position to take.<br/><br/>The movie presents us with basically ten years of Snowden's life. He begins as a soldier, trying to get into Special Ops, but he just isn't good enough and eventually is discharged because he's not physically up to the job. He ends up working for the CIA (and later the NSA) and during those years we see a gradual evolution in his understanding of his work. He progresses from a man who simply wanted to serve his country and help keep it safe to someone who concluded that the country he was serving wasn't the country he thought it was. One gets the impression that his real disappointment was in Barack Obama, who became president but changed nothing. His disillusionment, caused by his growing realization that a lot of the American intelligence services were actually busy primarily keeping tabs illegally on every day, law-abiding Americans, eventually leads to his decision to become a whistle blower and finally a man without a country - living in Russia, but with no place really to go. He did have the satisfaction, though, of seeing his leaks result in the surveillance program being supposedly cancelled. (Although - who knows?)<br/><br/>The movie provided a fascinating (and somewhat frightening) look at the ability of US Intelligence to keep track of its citizens activities (and presumably other countries have the same ability.) It's hard to watch this and not feel just a little bit paranoid, although I've been able to resist the temptation to put a band-aid over my laptop camera lens. And yet, while perhaps frightening, it's also hard not to be grudgingly impressed by what you see. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a fine job as Snowden. I also liked Gordon- Levitt's work in ""The Walk."" He's become a very fine actor since his early days as Tommy on ""3rd Rock From The Sun."" The movie has as its background Snowden's meeting with two reporters to whom he gives the classified information that he stole (who are played by Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto, who both were good but weren't really central in my opinion to the point of the movie, except that they facilitated the information getting out to the public.) There was a lot of reflection on Snowden's relationship with his girlfriend Lindsay, played by Shailene Woodley. Theirs was an up and down relationship - not surprisingly perhaps, since Snowden had to keep so much of his life and work secret even from her. Woodley, who I'm not familiar with, was fine in the role - and quite lovely as well. I was pleasantly surprised to discover in the captions as the movie ended that Lindsay had joined Snowden and now lives with him in Moscow.<br/><br/>My biggest criticism of the movie is that it was rather slow moving, and I thought a bit disjointed. There were times when I was having some trouble fitting all the various pieces together. It was an interesting movie, but it wasn't a movie that captivated me or held me spellbound. In the end, while I'm more sympathetic to Snowden, I also understand why the hero or traitor question is still an open one. It's certainly a complicated issue that will probably always polarize people."

","A fascinating example of a modern day whistle-blower, Edward Snowden makes for an intriguing and engaging subject matter, watch the Academy Award winning documentary Citizenfour for proof of this, but politically charged director Oliver Stone's film about the NSA contractor and computer genius, turned America's most wanted is a strangely unexciting affair.<br/><br/>Once hyped up as a potential Oscar contender, Stone's topical film seemingly struggles to nail down how to make this story truly tick and at 130 minutes in length, Stone's largely talk-heavy expose of Snowden's career and eventual whistleblowing (told largely via hotel room scenes that dominated Citizenfour) doesn't seem entirely comfortable with how it's going to engage its viewers, despite the nature of its story and a terrific turn by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Snowden.<br/><br/>After the misguided The Walk, it's refreshing to see Levitt once more showcase his considerable acting chops as Snowden. Nailing Snowden's demeanour and distinct voice, Levitt's turn helps elevate Snowden above where it may've laid without him and had the film found it's groove and the reception for it became stronger, it's possible it would've been a turn the recent awards season may've paid attention to.<br/><br/>Levitt is a clear standout in the acting stakes here as other big names like Shailene Woodley, Nicolas Cage and Timothy Olyphant get stung with rather forgettable supporting turns.<br/><br/>At times Snowden appears to be getting to convoluted or talk heavy for its own good but there's an undeniable quality sheen to the film that showcases this big budget production had the tools at its disposal to become one of 2016's most polished and interesting dramas.<br/><br/>Ed Snowden's story is a story deserving to be told and Stone has a clear affection for what the once proud American did for his country, it's not often a story like this displays such a clearly identifiable reasoning behind someone's potentially questionable actions.<br/><br/>Failing to ignite the public's interest or the affection of critics, Snowden may not be particularly memorable viewing but there's enough here, including a great final segment and a standout Gordon-Levitt turn to suggest that Stone's disappointing last decade or so behind camera is taking a turn for the better, even if Snowden wasn't the film he and many others were hoping it'd be.<br/><br/>3 Rubik's Cubes out of 5"

","When you watch an Oliver Stone flick, you get his slant, and not real history. The personal reasons of the subject are not the issue here. I give this a grudging 7 of 10, based upon a good illustration of the protagonist's motivations. But so far, history has shown, no benefit was derived from his actions, and far more damage to people's lives. Stone leaves out the damage done to peoples lives that resulted from Snowden's actions. All of history is full of patriots and tyrants who have had Snowden's motivations. In this case, he failed. Snowden wasn't a tyrant, but he certainly was a villain. The individual lives he damaged are unredeemed. And all the government had to do, was just write some different programs and change placement of assets, and discard painfully physical as well as mental damage to the human assets. Very sad. Why do smart liberal people think their outcome will be positive, when all that is certain is the damage? To me, hurting people because of a very slim chance of a positive outcome is morally repugnant. But once again, morals have little to do with the actions of men like Snowden."

"jadepietro","6","2","13","18 September 2016"," Snow Job
","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A slightly disappointing character study that suffers from  conventional storytelling.  GRADE: C+  SYNOPSIS: The life of Edward Snowden.   Oliver Stone has always been an audacious and exciting filmmaker. He  uses his anger about certain causes as his inspiration. Even when his  narrative becomes sanctimonious and convoluted, his visual flair and  kinetic style compensates for his grandstanding on political issues.  His films carry his unique vision along with his political message that  energizes his craft. His excesses hide a multitude of flaws in his  storytelling. Such is the case with his latest venture, Snowden.  The subject is controversial from the start. Villain or hero? Spy or  whistle-blower? Egotist or crusader? Traitor or patriot? Whatever your  viewpoint, be it liberal or conservative, his story remains a good  mystery to tell. Of course, Mr. Stone takes the latter road to travel,  painting this young computer geek as a saintly moral person caught  between governmental conspiracies and cover-ups. Snowden follows the  prototype of many of Stone's antiheroes from his other films. a common  man riling up against the establishment. Big Brother conspiracy  theories and paranoia abound.  He structures the film as a flashback, from 2013 with Laura Poitras'  documentary, Citizenfour, as the starting point (a good plot device)  before going back to 2004 with Edward Snowden as a ill-equipped recruit  with an overabundance of patriotic vigor who loves America and believes  wholeheartedly in its conservative values. Then a brief stint with the  CIA and on to a productive life as a National Security Agency lackey,  always with that same pro-American sentiment. This attitude will, of  course, change as he becomes corrupted by the system.  The problem with this film is a preachy script that simplified its  complex subject to the point of tedium. The film bores rather than  excites. The film's ongoing motif, that Big-Brother-is- watching theme,  is completely overstated, so evident in a scene of 1984 hysteria  involving a large over-sized head spouting hateful rhetoric to a small  insignificant Snowden figure.   For the most part, Mr. Stone's vision is straightforward, making his  title character a candidate for canonization from the onset rather than  show any of Snowden's human flaws. His Snowden is a shy introverted  idealist who becomes jaded with the military machine and with the  governmental agencies as his employer. The screenplay, by the director  and Kieran Fitzgerald, plays it too safe and politicizes its already  political character as a mere pawn. It is in need of some major  re-writing.  One of the director's initial missteps is trying to span nearly ten  years of Snowden's life instead of focusing on his more interesting  later years prior to his criminal act, or his whistle-blowing,  depending one your own viewpoint. It comes off as a Readers' Digest  abridged version. Granted, Mr. Stone honestly acknowledges that this  film is a dramatization, even if it is based on facts, but the drama is  seriously missing, placing the solemn seriousness front and center.  The other gaffe is putting the real Edward Snowden in the film's  conclusion, creating a jarring reaction that mixes fiction and reality  with an aftertaste that smacks of pure propaganda. Throughout the film,  Mr. Stone lays all of the blame on the American government's illegal  surveillance tactics upon its citizens and none of the irresponsibility  with Snowden's covert espionage actions and its possible repercussions  to its agents. This send the film into Crazyville mode, especially  hearing the real Snowden expounding scripted words in his own defense.  Except for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is quite compelling as Snowden,  and a fine performance by an unrecognizable Rhys Ifans, all the other  roles are sketchy and not well developed. Especially lacking any depth  is the romantic relationship with Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsey Mills,  which should be the central emotional connection with the movie-going  audience. Shailene Woodley tries to add some nuance to her  under-written character, but again the screenplay lets her and the  other actors down.  Snowden is a well-crafted film, nicely filmed by cinematographer  Anthony Dod Mantle. The film is a visual treat. Oliver Stone cannot  make anything that looks remotely inferior. He is a master showman,  always was and always will be. But his wobbly narrative, of which he is  partially to blame, cannot keep up with his strong images. Sadly,  Snowden becomes the ultimate snow job.   NOTE: Don't miss the end credits. They are the most focused and  powerful part of the film with Peter Gabriel's lovely original song,  The Veil, scored with wonderful archival footage and graphics concisely  edited to maximum effect."

"tymbus","6","1","5","14 December 2016"," Stone plays it safe
","If truth be told, I found Snowden a little dull. It is hard to make tapping keyboards dramatic, although director Oliver Stone does well to avoid the sci-fi visual melodrama of, for example, Blackhat. But there were too many occasions where I barely understood what was going on.<br/><br/>Stone reigns back on his own directorial flourishes- exemplified by Natural Born Killers - to tell the story straight. Some critics have unfavorably compared the movie to Citizen Four, a documentary. Although I haven't seen that, I can't say such a comparison is meaningful. Snowden is a film through and through. Stone explores Snowden's past and his present, including much that couldn't be shot by the documentary crew. Stone brings Snowden's secret world to life.<br/><br/>Stone uses the filming of Citizen Four as a framing device. There are 'artistic' touches - Snowden is often represented as walking alone into the distance, distorted by reflective images and white light. But my favourite directorial moment comes just after Snowden has seen field ops hack a lap top and surreptitiously turn it on to record a young woman in her hotel room. Stone cuts to Snowden making love to his girlfriend. Then, without really calling attention to it, we become aware of Snowden's own computer lurking on a wardrobe.<br/><br/>I felt Stone lost the plot with JFK and Snowden redeems him a bit in my eyes, although Snowden a less compelling film than JFK - it is easier to be melodramatic when you are confusing your audience with lies. One thing Snowden does do is cast a shadow over the Obama presidency when mass surveillance of everyone was the norm. <br/><br/>But then there had been 9/11. If you were president, what would you authorize to keep your nation safe? The answer I guess is that what is being protected is liberty and freedoms of thought , word and deed. If you loose those in the name of security then there is little left worth protecting.<br/><br/>Still, with UK Prime Minister Theresa May's snooper's charter being enacted in 2017, life is set to become more Orwellian in the UK. The internet is about to become the government's spy in your living room. <br/><br/>In fact, if the events in Snowden are true - and they are - much i have written above may well have started red flags flying in a tiny corner of the inter-web. Worrying. And, like walking down a street bristling with CCTV cameras, after watching Snowden I don't feel safe at all."

","In the summer of 2013, NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified documents, prompting the media to both champion him as a whistle-blower and call him a traitor......<br/><br/>With a director like Stone, a man known to be very controversial and daring when it comes to making fact based films, you would understandably expect this feature to take a lot of risks, and maybe vex some officials in suits somewhere, just like he did with J.F.K and Nixon.<br/><br/>But with Snowden, he plays it very safe, only hinting at what really happened behind the scenes, by using some very talented actors in small parts, and by also using some stunning imagery.<br/><br/>Levitt is sensational as the titular subject, almost playing Snowden as an innocent child who has been given the keys to the world, but cannot take what is inside his metaphorical Pandoras Box.<br/><br/>And this is where the film excels with its narrative, you know that he was taking some monumental risks with what he was doing, but he did it for the greater good, despite the ever growing paranoia which is affecting him, and wonderfully affecting the narrative.<br/><br/>The higher Snowden goes up the occupational ladder, the stronger the paranoia is, and the more effect it has on his relationship, which is also one of the films strong points.<br/><br/>Woodley is brilliant as Mills, and the narrative shows that she is dedicated to Snowden and despite her wariness about moving around, she stands by him, but Snowden doubts her, and thus in some scenes, we start to doubt her too, particularly during a party when we see Mills talking to a guy, but we are seeing it from Snowdens point of view, so we feel his paranoia.<br/><br/>Stone has gathered one of the best casts of the year, and they all put in tremendous performances, especially Ifans as O'Brian, the all seeing eye, and Stone reminds us that he is a force to be reckoned with, especially a scene where Snowden is talking to him on a huge monitor, the overwhelming effect that this has just shows that Stone still has that knack to get a point across.<br/><br/>Cage plays a very small role as Forrester, someone who may have known a little too much at one time, and so is relegated to some sort of lower level professor, possibly foreshadowing Snowdens future.<br/><br/>All in all, Snowden is an exceptional film, but it pulls its punches when it comes to the facts, and with Stone at the helm, I was expecting it to be a little more edgier.<br/><br/>Would make a great double bill with Citizenfour."

","For those who saw the 2015 award winning documentary 'Citizenfour'by Laura Poitras, there is much interesting backstory in Oliver Stone's movie 'Snowden' you won't want to miss. And of course for those who have not seen it, you should, you must.<br/><br/>Is there anyone on the planet who has access to a TV or to the web, reads the occasional newspaper who hasn't heard about Edward Snowden? The subject of the movie is of course the world famous whistle-blower, but the movie has as much to do with cyber spying and mass data gathering as it does with Snowden himself. Oliver Stone illustrates well the awesome, and I do mean awesome, power of the US intelligence community and in fact the intelligence community of all the major powers. It is, dare I say it, scary as hell. The movie may be a dramatization, but it does not leave anyone doubt about the government agencies capabilities nor are we left wondering what they can do with it.<br/><br/>The dream role of any actor is to portray real people of great notoriety and Joseph Gordon-Levitt landed that title character's role. He did as good a job as any actor could; I was pleased with his performance but I knew what this guy can do so I was not blown away nor surprised. He must have studied Snowden well because all who have seen the real Snowden, in the documentary and in the several interviews he's granted in recent years, have been exposed to just enough of the personality to be able to compare. As I mentioned, Gordon-Levitt did as good a job as any actor could.<br/><br/>We learn of Snowden's military debut, his rise thru the ranks of the intelligence agencies, his superior abilities and skills and the personal life dilemma he had to struggle with. Even if you treat the drama part in disbelief, one can still get a sense of the man as he might have been or is now.<br/><br/>The cast of characters from Zachary Quinto, to Nicolas Cage and the brilliant performance of Rhys Ifans will keep you interested. Lesser characters like that of the CIA agent in Geneva played by Timothy Olyphant, or the Trevor James character played by Scott Eastwood, whose resemblance to his famous father Clint is undeniable, or the Ewen MacAskill role played by Tom Wilkinson also add to the movie's plus factor.<br/><br/>You may have had an opinion about Snowden, whether you view him as a hero or a traitor, before the movie, but Oliver Stone's script and direction leaves no doubt as to what side he was on given his historical penchant. If you forgot about all the hype the true story gathered or about how serious a revelation the Times and The Guadian papers reported, you must see this film. Admittedly you may hate it if you strongly believe Snowden is a traitor, but you will like it if you are thankful for what we learned thanks to the man."

This film cast some light on the deep love between him and Lyndsay Mills, played well by Shailene Woodley..<br/><br/>The main criticism I had was about the content, feeling Oliver Stone should have been a bit more detailed in the type of phone hacking that was undertaken by the NSA.

","Citizenfour is a great documentary, and says most of what needs to be said about the time Snowden spent in Hong Kong. This movie does not spend too much time on this, so it works more as a companion piece rather than a fictionalized remake.<br/><br/>But it is fictionalized, and while the general facts about Snowden's life and motivations seems true, it's obvious that the scenes going on the NSA headquarters are dramatized. I'm sure Stone had to do some guessing to figure out how it all works in top secret bases, but it also seems like he used the freedom to ad some excitement and Hollywood-moments. In a movie like this, that's to be expected. But the story of Snowden is so interesting that I'd like to know exactly what went down, despite some details maybe never seeing the light of day.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt captures Snowden brilliantly, especially his voice mannerisms. The movie ends in a way that would have been risky has Gordon-Levitt not been such a capable actor."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","9","1","6","12 December 2016"," A riveting, thrilling must-see of a true story, a real eye-opener.
","So who is Edward Snowden? So of you may remember major news broadcasts back in June 2013 about a former, American intelligence worker who defected and exposed the US intelligence agency, the NSA, to the press and the world about their methods of gathering illegal intel; which resulted in him being instantly branded a traitor and had espionage charges brought upon. That was my initial thought when I saw him on the news being interviewed from an undisclosed hotel room in Russia. But is he a traitor or hero? A true patriot? Possibly none of these, just someone who was doing a job and was in a position to make a change. <br/><br/>Who better else to write/direct but none other than Oliver Stone, the controversial American filmmaker who has never shied away from depicting stories about his own government which actually does nothing more than raising awareness and questions from those who watch his movies concerning sensitive affairs. What I have always loved about Stone's storytelling, it that he doesn't really take a side or force opinions, and sometimes, like World Trade Center, JFK and his Vietnam trilogy, he tells a story about someone who was there, keeping to the truth as best of possibly but without directly attacking the subject matter or forcing blame or opinions. Snowden himself complimenting Stone saying how accurate the film is. <br/><br/>It doesn't glorify what he did, not at all and instead is documenting a stretched truth. I say stretched because certain characters and elements have been changed for dramatic effect, but let that not subtract anything away from the whole point of what the story is trying to say. It does leave very much open to debate about national security, democracy and privacy, breeding a sense of paranoia across the world, even the screenplay was apparently written on solely one computer that was never connected to the internet. <br/><br/>There has always been conspiracies about big brother always watching, providing a good source of fiction like George Orwell's iconic 1984, Dan Brown's Digital Fortress and films like Conspiracy Theory and Enemy of The State. But this is a documented truth, a leak that made many of those theories reality and a scary one at that. <br/><br/>This film is an amalgamation of the book Time of The Octopus by the Russian attorney handling Snowden's case, Anatoly Kucherena and the 2014 documentary, Citizenfour, which was incidentally directed by Melissa Leo, who plays journalist Laura Poitras in this movie. Following the events and life of Snowden leading up to the incident, giving us his history and character, and quite the insight of what was happening behind closed doors. <br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Snowden meticulously, looking uncannily like the real Snowden, he received praise from Snowden's parents after they had watched a screening. There's an impressive cast of supporting actors that came as a pleasant surprise, including Timothy Olyphant, Tom Wilkinson, Zachary Quinto and even Nicolas Cage who performed as a favour to Stone. <br/><br/>Rhys Ifans' was incredible, with Shailene Woodley also giving an impressive performance as Snowden's ever supportive girlfriend proving that this is more than just about the whistleblowing. It's a portrayal of a man who was doing a job that he was good at, it's about his life before and during. <br/><br/>I'm assuming each actor must have more than wanted to be in this movie considering it's sensitive subject matter and it shows, in all their performances that everyone was heavily invested in this film enforcing just how important this story is. Gordon-Levitt even pledged his salary to a cause regarding technology and democracy. There's a part of me that thinks, everyone starring in this now has a target on their backs or are now listed on some sort of watchlist. <br/><br/>It's superbly paced and structured in such a way, it keeps you gripped from start to finish. There's a good mixture of digital and visual effects which aren't normally present in Stone's film but this is always his first movie film entirely digitally. Good score from now, usual composer, Craig Armstrong and Adam Peters, accompanied by a mixed soundtrack with tracks from Boy Noize, Bach, Mozart and Peter Gabriel. <br/><br/>Very much like this year's The Big Short and Spotlight, where incredible and shocking truths are exposed, this is educational and everyone needs to see this film. I didn't want to watch anything else for quite awhile after, wanting digest everything I've just seen. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but it doesn't matter, as long as you understand what happened, this should be more than just a film, it's a wake up call. <br/><br/>Film aside for a moment, it has to be said, I'm not totally against the gathering of information, especially for those with nothing to hide, however the privacy is an big issue and the fact your own information could well be used against you. You have to ask yourself, given the access, who you have done the same thing? I would like to think it's what I would have done, being morally obligated to tell the unsuspecting world. <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 10 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 9 Script: 10 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being a riveting, thrilling must-see of a true story.

"burlesonjesse5","8","1","6","19 September 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Snowden
","I had one thought going into Oliver Stone's latest film. The issue isn't whether Stone is being paranoid. The issue is whether he's being paranoid enough. Natch.<br/><br/>So OK, conspiracy, controversy, yesteryear, and a persecution complex to boot. That's the Stoney way. And with Snowden (my latest review), he gives us his best film since Any Given Sunday.<br/><br/>Overall, Snowden is heads and tails above Oliver's box office bomb Alexander, his weak sequel in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and his conventional World Trade Center from a decade ago. It feels like the flick he was born to make. Granted, I don't know why Snowden's initial release was delayed (it was suppose to come out Christmas Day circa 2015). As a film, it doesn't appear as though it needed any additional scenes or reshoots.<br/><br/>Virtually nonviolent, dialogue driven and containing crisp cinematography, Snowden can be classified rather as violence of the mind, an absorbing multilayered drama, a frills-free thriller. No one feels safe in this movie and you know what, no one should. Oh and I almost forgot, there's a sequence where a drone flies above troupers heads (at a party) and then crashes to the ground. Man those things give me the creeps.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a return to form for the ripe, 70-year-old filmmaker. In truth, it might not be as flashy as some of his best work from the 1990's. Nevertheless, he brings some of his old tricks back to the table anyway. With Snowden, there is some indulgence with visuals in the form of freeze frames, archive footage, and even slight animation. Stone as expected, also gives us a script in Snowden that seems to wanna speculate on facts even though everything is supposedly based on a true story (this isn't necessarily a bad thing). Finally, Stone revels in casting well known actors/actresses that fade in and out of the proceedings. Snowden has brief appearances by Scott Eastwood, Melissa Leo, Tom Wilkinson, Nicolas Cage, Timothy Olyphant, and Rhys Ifans. Again, this isn't a negative connotation towards Oliver Stone. It's just you know, predicted.<br/><br/>Resembling a neutered version of Stone's own masterful JFK and a shortened version of 2006's The Good Shepard, Snowden chronicles the main character of real-life, CIA whistleblower Edward Joseph Snowden (played brilliantly by consummate chameleon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Much of the film is told in flashbacks from 2004 to present day in 2013. Ed Snowden journeys from being a discharged Special Forces candidate to a ""security specialist"" to working for the Central Intelligence Agency to being a lead technologist at NASA. The movie also gives insight into Edward's long-standing relationship with his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley).<br/><br/>Bottom line: Oliver Stone's work always seems to be overfilled with ideas. He's the mad dog filmmaker, the guy who conjectures, the guy whose storytelling sensibilities go a little off-kilter. Snowden is an example of this but like most of his best vehicles, it brims with energy, fire, and eerie secrecy. My nephew and movie critic colleague gave it four stars. I thought it dragged a bit at 138 minutes but still stuck with me long after the closing credits came up. My overall rating: 3 and a half stars."

If I would have used the acronym NSA this review might have landed me on a watchlist. I'm way too clever for that.<br/><br/>Seriously though, this movie was great and it's pretty authentic as well. The man himself is actually in the movie and was paid a hefty sum by Mr. Oliver Stone for Stone to have access. I believe it was a million bucks. Nice! Way to go Oliver.<br/><br/>As for the authenticity I mentioned, I've watched the actual footage of Snowden from those crazy days in 2013 when he blew his whistle and I have to say that they captured it all pretty nicely. On top of which we were given a bit of history leading up to those days to help understand the man's motives. Although, this was one area where they could have done a better job. Still, enough was given and it certainly was quite revealing and educational.<br/><br/>In addition to the masterful job done by Stone, Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave us a brilliant portrayal of the man. The voice, facial expressions, and overall demeanor really captured the essence of Snowden. The rest of the cast and related tech were also done really well.<br/><br/>Listen folks, Edward Snowden is a true hero and perhaps one of the bravest people we will ever know in our lifetimes. It's unfortunate though that more people don't see it that way and that he's still an outcast from our society.<br/><br/>He should be let back into the country and commended for his actions. Heck, the guys deserves a parade down Pennsylvania Ave., but I'm guessing he would cringe at such a thought.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, President Obama, you know, the guy who LIED to us all and broke all of his promises about the government spying on American citizens, still regards him as a criminal. Perhaps though the next administration can step in and get this one right.<br/><br/>I'll end this with my favorite Snowden quote and one that people truly need to understand and be most wary of.<br/><br/>""No system of mass surveillance has existed in any society that we know of to this point that has not been abused."" - Edward Snowden"

","This movie is a great introduction for whomever wants to take the red pill and catch-up on reality: ...<br/><br/>Pi22a g8 ... Haiti Clinton charity - 33 kids missing, ... Jersey island (near England) - investigation , ... Madeleine McCann kidnapping, ... Hampstead cover-up .... ... the whole thing then gets explained by itself. ... And then you know what is the state of the world YOU live in.<br/><br/>From Ebert site:<br/><br/>If Edward Snowden didn't exist, Oliver Stone might have invented him. One can imagine a Stone film about a former employee of the U.S. government who becomes disillusioned with his country when he learns the depth of its deceit. In fact, that last sentence could describe a few Stone films, and so ""Snowden"" has been widely anticipated as a return to form for the director of masterpieces like ""Platoon,"" ""JFK"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July."" It's his first film in four years and his first with a true story behind it in almost a decade (""W."")."
"blanbrn","6","1","7","20 September 2016"," Pretty good film of a whistle blower not a yes man who looks out for people's protected rights!
","Director Oliver Stone is still doing it making movies about issues that circle around people's world and it involves events that are history making and life changing. And again Oliver makes a delivery here with this one as the biography picture called ""Snowden"" gives an in depth look at NSA whistle blower Edward really good. As for many like me I look at Edward as a hero for uncovering the truth about the illegal on goings of the NSA as how they were spying and collecting data on Americans most private things like listening in on phone and cell calls and monitoring internet surfing and collecting credit and bank accounts and finding about travel information on citizens. As it's clear no one lives in a private world! And Joseph Gordon Levitt portrays Edward with life and hard work ethic as an agency worker about his job. Overall pretty good film that's revealing that blows the lid government and shows it's good to speak up and not be a yes man!"
"shadowyx12","7","1","7","18 September 2016"," Oliver Stone paints a thrilling and realistic portrait of one of our generation's most controversial figures.
","""Snowden"" recounts the many events leading up to Edward Snowden's decision to expose several NSA secrets to the world, and the aftermath of that exposure.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a drama/conspiracy thriller with a core focus on the protagonist's relationship with his love interest. In many ways, ""Snowden"" reminds me a lot of ""JFK"" - another Stone film. Although I don't think this film compares to ""JFK"" in terms of excitement nor gravitas (nor being as technically jaw-dropping), I still enjoyed ""Snowden"".<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon Levitt is nearly perfect as Snowden. He not only has his voice and manner of speaking down but he also explains complicated technical jargon as if it was second nature. Throughout Levitt's brilliant performance, we see the hardships of Snowden's life gradually subtly take a toll on his character. Simply put, I felt sympathy for Snowden.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley gives a powerhouse of a performance as Lindsay Mills, Snowden's girlfriend. She's introduced as a fun-loving, relatively carefree photographer in the beginning but becomes increasingly estranged as the years go by and her boyfriend constantly leaves her in a shroud of secrecy. She acts as the perfect foil to Levitt's slightly awkward/consistently conflicted Snowden. This is by far one of Woodley's best roles.<br/><br/>The rest of the ensemble cast isn't nearly as memorable as the film's two leads, but they give believable performances. I do want to give an honorable mention to those who play the team assembled by Snowden to leak his information - Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, and Tom Wilkinson. Their realistic portrayals of Poitras, Greenwald, and MacAskill act as a driving force in elevating the film's dramatic tension.<br/><br/>The story jumps back and forth from Snowden's past to Snowden conspiring with his team in a Hong Kong hotel room. The structure is easy enough to follow for just about anyone but the pace may be insufferably slow for most viewers. The film takes its time to explore the different time periods of Snowden's employment within the CIA and NSA. We see him learn (and in turn, we learn) about the different programs used by the NSA and just how invasive and threatening they can actually be.<br/><br/>The emotional core lies in the increasingly shaky relationship between Snowden and Mills. JGL and Woodley have fantastic chemistry, but the film goes a little too far in drawing out their characters' relationship problems. At some point, their ups and downs repeat and slow the film down to a crawl a result.<br/><br/>""Snowden"" couldn't have been released at a better time. In a time of strong political turmoil, Stone's film reminds viewers to reevaluate Snowden's actions, mass surveillance, and your right to privacy. The film serves as a counter to how the government and mainstream media wants you to perceive Snowden. <br/><br/>""Snowden"" is far from being one of Oliver Stone's bests (the main problems being its uneven focus, pacing, and duration) but is a well-made film that's visually compelling and thoroughly researched. It won't be able to hook everyone in but it will certainly make them shudder."
"leftistcritic","3","1","9","19 January 2019"," Annoying, boring film
","Sure, this film was a fast-paced drama. But at the same time it also was distorting the reality of what happened for something that ended up not having much of an impact at all, only leading to a few changed minds then people forgot about it all. All in all this movie is not worth anyone's time.<br/><br/>But one paragraph is not, in and of itself, enough to grant this film a rating of 3 out of 10. I would say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a good role as Edward Snowden, and Shailene Woodley does the same as Lindsay Mills, Snowden's girlfriend. I guess after following this whole saga over the past few years and having Snowden become a celebrity and all, with the archive of his records recently deleted by The Intercept, this film seems relatively annoying and boring. The fact that Oliver Stone made this film is a damn shame, as he's made much better films in the past like Scarface (1983), Platoon (1986), and Wall Street (1987) to name a few.<br/><br/>With that, my review of this film comes to a close."

","All it does is replacing nazism (nationalism in any case) with this so-called patriotism -like there is a difference. Its flaw is that it has a very old, very male, director. How can he not be that conservative? To be free you need to destroy the constitution first. I quote from ""Political thinking for the masses: way to freedom"": ""When you hear 'founding fathers', it can't end well. It only suggests a different kind of nationalism: 'patriotism' they call it. It's like LGBTQIetc. (ch. 5) in the place of binary identifications: it's still identities. Why care? Why care where you live, or about names? We're talking about 19th and 18th century: that was not freedom. Also, the 'ancient romans': you can't say that liberty (civilization) started there, and then evolved. As long as there were slaves (or simply no discursivity), it had nothing to do with liberty."""

The voice of Joseph Gorden-Levitt, the manners, the looks, everything was so unbelievably realistic! I just cannot believe how well he did in this role.

"WooderIce64","6","0","1","24 January 2019"," Decent Political Drama
","This dramatization of Edward Snowden's 2013 leak of classified NSA information is far from best movie ever, but far from the worst. The most notable aspect is that Joseph Gordon Levitt does a good job at portraying the controversial whistleblower. Levitt is a great actor, and this is one of his finest performances. He does exactly what any good movie, especially one about a real, living person should; it shows the audience how he got to his place, what his actions were, and why he did them. That way, the audience can relate to him, understand him, and make a more informed judgement on his actions. The rest of the cast is generally well acted, which is good. However, there are detracting elements. First off, this movie has possibly the most pointless sex scene I've ever seen. Pointless sex is one of my least favorite movie tropes. It seems like it was there just to reaffirm that the movie would be rated R. Second, it has really unnecessary cameos by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton (bearing in mind this movie came out a month before the election), in which they both condemn Snowden's actions. It just felt forced. Therein lies one of the problems with the movie as a whole: unlike much of Oliver Stone's other stuff, it doesn't seem like it's trying as hard as the others to be controversial. Oliver Stone is known for his controversial content, and we've come to expect content that would start conversation, like Snowden did. This isn't exactly it. It feels more like a historical drama that a current political movie. Generally speaking, though, your views of Snowden as a person will reflect your views on this movie. If you think he did the right thing, you may like it. If you think he's a traitor, you probably won't. It's rather simple that way, but there's not much more to it."
"Padreviews","9","0","1","2 September 2018"," Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy
","Generally speaking we all love our country and are patriotic but this film really questions who is the good guy and who is the bad guy .<br/><br/>This is a well documented true story so there's no spoilers here but what is great about Oliver Stone's movie is story behind the story - great storytelling about the background to how Ed Snowden got to be where he was and there was no doubting his patriotism right from the start but in the end the machine ( being the government ) like skynet turned on its owners and started to spy on those who were their ultimate paymasters without their authority without their knowledge and what he did by being a 'traitor' was an act of heroism depending upon how you feel a government should be allowed to go in the pursuit of knowledge about ordinary folk under the false pretence that it is in the name of national security , rather than an inability to keep one's hands out of the cookie jar . <br/><br/>The film keeps your interest from start to finish and tells the story in a series of flashbacks starting from the meeting with the Guardian journalists in Hong Kong . You feel like your watching a Modern day Turin played by young Kevin Spacey lookalike . Rhys Ifans deserves praise for his acting without a trace of his trademark welsh accent . The love between his girlfriend and him with the added pressure of stress at work , his moral dilemma and failing health all adding to the drama . <br/><br/>You are left hoping the real Ed Snowden is allowed to return to his home country and receive a fair trial or amnesty for you feel what he did was in the interests of the freedom of the people who in a free world should be able to trust their own government. <br/><br/>Finally what it does do is show how prophetic the 1998 ( pre 9/11 ) film ENEMY OF THE STATE was where everything revealed in this film prophecized ! <br/><br/>Pad.A 9/10"

"neil-476","7","0","1","16 May 2018"," I think I detect an agenda...
","Edward Snowden works for various clandestine elements of the US government machinery. While writing software to shut down Chinese hackers, he discovers that the US is carrying out illegal surveillance over billions of emails from US citizens. What should he do?<br/><br/>Well, we know what he did, he blew the whistle. And despite the fact that he was proved right, and measures were taken to stop the illegal collection of uncountable emails, his copybook is so comprehensively blotted that he remains an exile in Moscow.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone takes things very seriously indeed, and this can sometimes result in two things: one, his personal agenda overtakes the story he is telling and, two, the issues he is raising overpower the entertainment value of the movie. Both these flaws are at work here.<br/><br/>Stone clearly regards Snowden as a hero, a martyr. Maybe this is justified, but it is a little difficult to tell because Stone only ever gives us one side of the picture.<br/><br/>And, unforgiveably, the movie is somewhat on the dull side. Snowden's story is interesting and has built in suspense but, at 134 minutes, the telling of it drags noticeably at times.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a good performance as Snowden, as does Shailene Woodley as his girlfriend Lindsay Mills. For me, the best performance was Rhys Ifans, almost unrecognisable as CIA Deputy Director Corbin O'Brian.<br/><br/>I came out of this better informed I think, though it was difficult to tell how much of what I was being fed was fact, and how much was Stone's overheated agenda at work. But I can't honestly say I was entertained that much."

"leonblackwood","5","0","2","20 August 2017"," Average watch but not that surprising! 5/10
","Review: I wasn't that impressed with this movie, because I found it quite boring after a while, and most of the information throughout the film, wasn't that surprising. I've always known that Big Brother is watching every move that we make but after watching this film, I appalled with how far the government actually went. Edward Snowden, played by Joseph Gordon- Levitt, damages his legs whilst trying to join the army, so he joins the CIA's hacking department to serve his country. After a couple of dodgy missions, he leaves the CIA and lives a quiet life with his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) but he soon returns to the CIA, and he soon realises that the government have gone to far with there methods to spy on people. With the pressure of his job taking its toll on his relationship, he decides to tell the press about the governments undercover methods, knowing that he will be sent to jail. With the CIA on his tail, he manages to give the press all of the information he has gathered over the years, and when it gets broadcasted, he flees to Russia, we're they have given him a 3 year pass to stay in there country. Its quite an intense movie, which will make you think twice about using electrical devices but from an entertainment point of view, I found it quite boring after a while. The whole cast put in an average performance, and the whole back and forth in time concept, spoilt the flow of the movie. Most of the technical jargon went straight over my head, and the love story lacked emotion and detail but it's still worth a watch, just to see how deep the American government pry into the publics private life. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie was directed by Oliver Stone, 70, who has brought you movies like the Hand in 1981, Salvador, Platoon, Wall Street, Talk Radio, Born On The Fourth Of July, The Doors, JFK, Heaven & Earth, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, U Turn, Any Given Sunday, Comandante, Alexander, World Trade Center, W., South Of The Border, Wall Street II and Savages. It certainly is an impressive filmography, and the fact that he wrote Scarface, Year of the Dragon and Midnight Express, really does make him one of the top filmmakers in Hollywood. He is one for sticking to the facts, so I'm not surprised with the outcome of this movie. Being an American, he was brave to touch on a subject which goes against the government but I think the main problem is that it's not surprising that they are so corrupt. Anyway, is OK when you first watch it but I can't see people watching it twice.<br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $37.2million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/thriller/dramas, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Melissa Leo, Zachary Quinto, Rhys Ifans, Nicolas Cage, Shailene Woodley, Tom Wilkinson, Joely Richardson, Timothy Olyphant, Scott Eastwood and Ben Chaplin. 5/10"

The government can tap into emails, phone calls, anything online gathering data. Problem is the government was doing this without just cause or a court order. And eventually he begins to feel some guilt about it. So, he steals some files that prove the spying and he gives them to the media. And the USA labels him a traitor, but others say he is a whistleblower and should not face criminal charges.

","'SNOWDEN' was directed by Oliver Stone and stars Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Shailene Woodly and Melissa Leo. It is the incredible true story of how one man(Edward Snowden/Joseph Gordon Levitt) changed the face of surveillance and really how we deal with privacy and the government today.<br/><br/>​ It's really impossible to review this movie without some form of bias. I for one see Edward Snowden as a hero and respect him fully for what he did for his country. Due to the heavily divided views on what Snowden did, it's hard to watch this movie(with any level of insight) in a completely fair and just manner in which you don't take the director's clear view into account. That said, I will definitely say that the majority of people who see this movie will enjoy seeing it. If you have a very avid opinion against the view represented here, you will probably not enjoy it unless you can put all that aside. If you can separate your views and focus on the actual movie itself, you'll be in for a mixed bag of everything.<br/><br/>The story, for starters, is competently told and, from my knowledge, tells it in a mostly honest way. That said, there are many moments in the film were they try to add tension but it just doesn't work and feels no manipulated and forced. If all them things did happen then I'm sorry but unless I'm proved otherwise, the tension in this movie was very contrived. I also feel like they kind of glossed over what he actually did in the movie. Like it or not, he changed the entire world and they just kind of glide past the impact with a minute tribute.<br/><br/>Next, the acting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a pretty good job as Edward Snowden and I understand the burden of representing someone who is A) Still Alive and B) changed the entire world as we know it. Shaillene Woodley was fine as Lindsay Mills. I can't say that any of the acting was sub-par just that some characters were underdeveloped and really should have earned more screen time.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the movie movie is pretty solid. The cinematography is mostly fine with a few editing choices and rapid camera movements that I thought were out of place and didn't work for the rest of the film. In conclusion, this movie has pretty good drama and is entertaining if you can looking past all political opinions. If you can do that, I recommend it.<br/><br/>7/10"
"SquigglyCrunch","7","0","1","11 May 2017"," One of Those Movies that I Really Enjoyed but was Just a Little Too Slow to Fully Enjoy
","Snowden follows Edward Snowden as he works for various groups where he handles classified information, when he learns that the government can and is watching just about everyone without them knowing, so he decides to leak the information. <br/><br/>For starters, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is pretty great here. The performance he gives is authentic but still intelligent. He isn't just your generic tech nerd character, he has a personality, and his performance really shows that. Shailene Woodley does a great job as well, though she isn't given quite as much as Gordon-Levitt to work with. The rest of the cast is solid, but they don't get much better than these two. <br/><br/>The writing here is painstakingly thorough. When I say that, it's both a good and a bad thing. On the bright side, the plot and characters are very well fleshed out. And something I loved was that you didn't have to be incredibly smart to understand a lot of the dialogue. The characters didn't use language that was heavily technology-based, so I actually understood the vast majority of the story. The plot wasn't lost in the language, and for a movie like this one that is certainly a welcome aspect of it. As a result of the thorough writing the characters were fairly well fleshed out, adding another level of depth to the movie. When there were tense moments they were actually tense. When something important happened there was weight. I actually cared about the characters. On the down side, however, the writing was so thorough that the movie became somewhat slow. It's one of those movies that you really like or find interesting, but it's just a tad too slow to fully enjoy. I feel like a bit of time could've been shaved off and it would've largely remained the same while still being thorough. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed Snowden. While it was slow almost all throughout, it was thorough and well performed. In the end I would recommend this movie."
"Quinoa1984","7","0","1","19 April 2017"," Watching the Watchers
","I don't know if I have enough thoughts on this yet for a full review - I know I liked it, maybe some of Snowden's personality himself rubbed off on me the wrong way at times (as with other stories of high-strung whistleblowers like Serpico and The Insider seeing the interactions the protagonists have with the women in their lives is hard to watch ... I should also note Woodsley was highly underrated in this, as was probably Gordon Levitt, but somehow I keep thinking about her and how, for one of the handful of times in Stone's career, Heaven & Earth included, he has a solid three-dimensional female character to work with, but I digress).<br/><br/>But it features a solid script that doesn't necessarily have that feverish energy of the 80's/90's Stone movies - though, with age, Stone also therefore has appeal, one can hope if his name isn't too attached to those iconoclast cherry bombs, to middle America and people who want to see a simple good thriller, and this serves that purpose. It also has some of the strongest visual ideas Stone has had in a long time, maybe since Alexander or longer; the highlight of the film (aside from Nicolas Cage's precious minutes) is when Snowden faces his boss/mentor played by Rhys Ifans when he is in trouble, in a conference room, as the man's face is on a giant screen, seemingly 3 times Snowden's full size (but it seems to loom larger). That's the tense-as-s**t Stone I've been missing, and it's all done in shot-reverse-shot and largely dependent on the size of characters in the frame (in a sense it's sort of like the reverse of that scene in Network between Beatty and Finch).<br/><br/>Maybe another viewing will change my mind, though it's hard to shake the fact that we already have CITIZENFOUR in this world, and that's kind of enough. So it's a good Stone film, it truly is, but it's missing that *something* that I can't describe just yet from his work in the 90's."

","Not to repeat the positive and negative points that so many have thoroughly written already... but, straight to the point: Joseph Gordon-Levitt's voice change (obviously) to imitate Edward Snowden was so annoying and not even necessary. His real voice is more alike Edward's than his imitation one (as one can confirm in the bonus material's interview or other interviews online).<br/><br/>This is an important film on one of the most critical subjects (besides climate change, environmental concerns, pollution, overpopulation, etc.) in this modern era. Everyone should view it at least once and further explore the topic of concern for the sake of human rights, privacy rights, constitutional rights, government overreach, government illegal activities, government misleading and misinformation, whistle blowers'rights and their endured injustices...<br/><br/>Regardless of what one's opinion of Oliver Stone's movies and his politics, this film is more fact based, less dramatized, and most balanced in its presentation than Oliver Stone haters have tried to smear in their knee-jerk-reaction campaigns.<br/><br/>Overall (directing, acting, screenplay, cinematography): a solid 8<br/><br/>Topic of concern: a definite 10"

","I had like to begin by saying I'm not an American and I haven't seen the Oscar winning documentary 'Citizenfour'. But I'm very much aware of everything about it through the all kinds of coverages. So my perspective about the film will be true and about the content will be neutral. I have known about what this film dealt since the day it all began. I did not care much, but there are things to concern about it. Like if it is necessary to tap to prevent the serious threats, there's nothing wrong it that. Because, even if they have our private contents, they are not going to publish it or make money out of it. So that makes what Ed did was unethical and betrayal for his own country.<br/><br/>In another angle, NSA's illegal surveillance questionable in many ways, but wrong is only a tiny thing. Because eyeing every single one of us seems wrong, though without examining all, nothing confirms, differentiate between right and wrong. So coming to the film, it was decently made one. The main reason is it was too long and many parts were boring. The theme was powerful like it was a one liner, but the film contents were very weak. Except Snowden passing the security, the rest of the story like why he did, including his personal life, particularly his romance was not good enough to make a film. This is very much suitable for a documentary than a feature film.<br/><br/>But I liked the actors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was good, but not great. If he gets the Oscars nod, that's only because of the issue which the film inspired by, not because his phenomenal character display. The direction was decent, but not the screenplay. The film is not for everyone, but I recommend it to all as a must see. The main reason why you should watch it is to educate yourself. To learn what they are doing and how. Particularly, you will definitely come to know how to avoid being eyed by the government in a simple way. So that's a good thing than whining over what homeland security does to protect the nation. It is not an inspiring biopic, or a masterpiece, but don't miss it for any cost.<br/><br/>P.S. Whatever the form of the governments, the nations won't stop doing what in this film they said was wrong. Because there's no Edward Snowden in every nation to expose it. In that perspective, the US was really embarrassed for their own man letting them down. The China is the number one in this kind of activity. The point is, these things happening right now or not, but should never come to public notice like that happened in here, never should leave the compound. Suppose if we come to know, we will protect, at least in the democratic countries that's what we do. But not to forget it also safeguards us. That means it is like the stars and planets on the sky that we watch and take notes, but they are untouchable. We only monitor them for threats like asteroids and fractionally thinking about the alien invasion.<br/><br/>7/10"

There is a lot of positive aspects about this movie, such as the cinematography and the superb acting by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really put on his A game by trying to look and act like Edward Snowden. I also though the dramatic portion of the film didn't go super overboard to the point it got really cheesy. But here is the thing, the movie goes in a step by step direction. Which didn't really bring about any emotions or inspirations for me as the viewers. The whole Edward Snowden private life and his ticks just didn't interest me at all. I know this might make me come off as a snobbish viewer but the whole thing just came off uninspiring and bland. Despite it trying to portray Snowden as this super smart patriotic guy that has a love affair with a girl and tries to do the right thing. It just didn't have that build up that lead to that impact that it needed.

","It's tough to comment on a movie that is based on real events. If they change anything, they sold out to the dramatic sensationalist side, if they show it as it was, it is too boring.<br/><br/>As such, Snowden is a mediocre movie because it doesn't inflame me with rage on how much they changed the truth, nor does it disappoint me with just listing dull facts. But the movie is well done, well acted with a great performance from Gordon-Levitt and, more than anything, it tells the damn story. The story here is important.<br/><br/>First of all, it is always possible that people have not heard of or not understood the Snowden incident. It is important for them to hear and understand it. Then it is always possible that, having been informed, they choose to remain indifferent, on the basis that even with a whole world knowing what the secret services of the US are doing, nothing has changed. Those people are wrong. It was an unreasonable expectation for one man to change a half a trillion dollar industry by himself. However, it was never hoped that a man can make any difference against these kinds of odds and Snowden did so. We can discuss about this today, with facts not fantasies, because of what that man did.<br/><br/>When faced with seemingly overwhelming power, most people submit. They do so not because of the power itself, but its appearance, the perceived consequences of fighting it. Snowden showed that even the most powerful are not omnipotent or omniscient and that they still have to answer to all of us. As the carrier of this message, I applaud the movie.<br/><br/>Yet, as someone who knew of the real life events, I had only the dramatics of the film to entertain me and those, understandably so, were not many. You know what would really make my day, though? An aftermath movie. A Snowden sequel with everything (if anything) that has changed, watching the people in the middle of it, even if it is all dramatic fiction based on what we publicly know. Because right now the greatest enemy of people getting why this film was important is the bleak realization that essentially little has changed and they fail to grasp the importance of those little changes."

","I really think this movie should not have been made. Having been from a small country in Europe and not knowing much about Edward Snouden and all the shenanigans he pulled, I decided it was time for me to get to know the whole story. First I saw Snouden, and was amazed, and would give it a straight 9 right away, but then I dug in some research because the story really amazed me, and then found out about Citizenfour, which is the real documentary Laura Poitras filmed in the hotel room when he was uncovering the secrets to her and the journalists. And that movie absolutely blew my mind, so this one went from 9 to 7, and I think that 7 is still influenced by the fact that the movie is based on real events. If it were not, I'm sure it wouldn't have gone over 6. In giving a review for a scripted movie, one must ignore the fact that it is made on real events as much as possible, otherwise the rating are given to the real story, and not the made up parts, and not the acting, effects, music etc. <br/><br/>So this movie is basically just a remake of a documentary movie that went out not more than 2 years ago, which most of the people are not aware of, but with greater marketing budget, and I can understand in some part that they made it while the topic is still hot. Joseph- Gordon Levitt's performance was a masterpiece, although I'm pretty sure his voice in the movie is not his real voice, he sounds like Christian Bale in the Batman."

","""Snowden"" is the retelling of the real life events that went down between 2004 and 2013, from when the famous Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon Levitt) was first introduced into the army, following him through all of his various assignments in the secret intelligence to when, in 2013, he met the journalists in Hong Kong to whom he revealed the truth on the American government.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley are possibly the two actors I most admire in the cinematic industry right now, so to see them paired up was definitely something that got me excited even if Oliver Stone who is a director I've never really connected with was at the helm. Coming out I was most pleasantly surprised at the solid 135 minute thriller I had just experienced, even though I didn't exactly feel the intellectual stimulation I wished for.<br/><br/>Since I've said it in the intro, there's no sense in playing around it: what makes this film work at its core are the two performances at the center of it and how bright they shine: Levitt and Woodley have the perfect off balance, quirky chemistry on screen their characters call for. Their relationship touches a very wide range of emotional beats, admittedly quite a few that don't belong in this film, but for the majority the film really sells you on their lives and its job is nothing short of great in using this relationship to help ground the film and the characters, making them truly relatable, they have a work life and a home life and seeing their daily lives juxtaposed to the madness Snowden has to experience really helped in making the audience closer to the moral difficulties involved.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, with the exception of Nicholas Cage who it's great to see, no cast members really stick out and some of them actually go into some weird territory where they don't seem to belong to the right film, even though that is probably due to how Stone is directing them, but more on that later. On the positive side Stone demonstrates all of the ability he has accumulated as a director and all of the years of experience are on display. He knows this medium and the way he uses it is simply effortless, that is way he gets away with using techniques and shots that call attention to themselves so much. He knows how to make a sequence fluent, how to keep an audience on the edge of their seats and how to build tension naturally and every edit in this film is a demonstration of that, it's just impossible not to get absorbed by this slick narrative. Moreover the story and the intrigue is naturally fascinating and Stone and his co-writer Fitzgerald manage to guide you through it expertly, making you understand every step of the way and never loosing a clear sense of geography and chronology.<br/><br/>Unfortunately someone has to tell Oliver Stone that he is making a feature film and not some two hour media product that is to be released in cinemas as a form of his personal propaganda. Now the fact that I am neither American neither a political person makes all of this irrelevant to me and touches me in absolutely no way. Where I take issue with this is from an artistic point of view, firstly because switching to real life footage in a film is something that is terribly difficult to do and works once out of one thousand times. It is something that has always bothered me, but the way this film does it is disastrous to the point that it switches to being a documentary. Moreover, the intellectual and political conversation is always one sided and leaves you quite sour. It is certainly a well told story, but it does not have the moral ambiguity that great films leave you with, on the contrary in one particular scene involving Rhys Ifans and giant screen the film just escalates into political conspiracy territory and whilst the events may or may not have happened that way, on a film level it goes 1984 tonally and doesn't resemble what the film should be.<br/><br/>Yet, by all means, Stone crafts an undeniable thrill ride for the whole duration of it and rarely leaves you uninterested which is a feat on its own, adding to that the pleasure of seeing a veteran at work and ""Snowden"" turned out to be a worthy effort even with its particular flaws."

"kendallvmead","7","0","4","12 October 2016"," Snowden is an Icon.
","Oliver Stone did wonderful work when directing this film not only to showcase the true facts but once again he allowed the viewers to make their own decisions to deem this event right or wrong. Edward Snowden has become an Icon for many Americans but, more so, an Icon for many others in other countries. Which is why I was pleased with how this movie was done but I was very pleased that it was made at all. <br/><br/>Starting this review off I am going to discuss the one problem I had with the film which was the length of it. Yes, I am aware of how much information had to go into the movie and how each detail was important but that doesn't change the fact that it felt about 20 minutes to long for me. To pinpoint the scenes that could have been shortened or taken out completely I would have to watch the movie again, and believe me I will, but until then all in all it just felt to long. Many people, not only in America but in the world, knew what had happened with Edward Snowden because it was a huge piece of news to everybody so some of the knowledge was common knowledge. Since some knowledge was common knowledge I felt like it would have been easy to shorten the film by just a small amount, but then again, I don't know how much information Edward Snowden wanted portrayed in this film. <br/><br/>Onto the most interesting piece of information I encountered in this film was how Edward Snowden smuggled the files out and sadly the world may never know exactly how he did it. However, what I specifically liked about the context of this scene was the fact Edward Snowden came up with it. He was interviewed for this film to make the facts as accurate as possible and the smuggling was the only part that he would not give answers on but he gave Oliver Stone the idea. Which makes us all question if that is how he did it. <br/><br/>All in all while this movie was a bit on the longer side I was very happy with how things turned out and how, as an audience viewer, we were able to look onto Snowden's life as a whole and not just the portion that was in the media. We got to see some friendships grow, his relationship go through ups and downs, how he was influenced by the NSA and what they made him do. It was more than just the smuggling of some files, it was a life story that was beautifully directed with Oscar Worthy performances from every actor. A definite must see."

","Our lives are sustained by narratives, in which we believe, versions of the facts in which we trust. Most of that we acquire through upbringing, social environment, education. Where you are born (country) determines a great deal of what you are likely to believe in throughout your life.<br/><br/>What Snowden did was not so much shocking in terms of the revelations themselves: the idea that the American government spies on us, all over the world, no matter where. I believe every regime always uses everything in their power to monitor their faithful subjects. We are all American subjects right now in a way or another. So if, say, the Roman Empire or the Nazis had that kind of technology and ruled over a world where pretty much everybody carries a Geo-located device with camera and mic in their pocket, they certainly would have made use of that. What Snowden did is important not because of what he reveals, but because he did reveal it and proved it. He defeated an accepted and implemented narrative - that that the USA government is always ""the good guy"", and uses its infinite powers only for good and just causes; has a constitution which is as sacred as the Bible and which prevails above everything else, and so on. That Snowden was able to flip that story inside out with all the personal risks within is remarkable. He revealed the American superficial narrative to be mainly false, as the American government exercises all kinds of brutalities that equal and exceed those of the oppressive regimes in countries they claim to liberate. <br/><br/>Along comes Oliver Stone, and does his take of the known facts. We can see the self-reference at the beginning: Snowden starts as a young typical conservative, willing to ""serve the country"", going to war for it. This mirrors Stone, the Vietnam veteran, who willingly enlisted to ""protect"" whatever lies somebody was feeding America with at the time. As the story progresses, Snowden questions the ends, and the means to them. So did Stone. In the end Snowden comes out as a kind of an also typical American hero, who risks everything, his life included, to ""do the right thing"".<br/><br/>He maps the Snowden story onto the 1984 metaphor, thus the ""O'Brien"" character, which is obvious but adequate. Along the way he drops a few hints (intended or not) that he himself is driven by internal affairs concerns, and not so much by a general sense of justice: there is a scene in the NSA headquarters in Hawaii where Snowden shows his colleagues a world map and all the emails intercepted in every country. Apparently there was no special concern that, for example, individuals from Germany or Brazil are being illegally spied, only that Americans are At least he aptly edits real clips of real people (Obama included) telling their own narrative, proved a lie when layered over the Snowden story we're being told.<br/><br/>The difference between this narrative and others that Stone has already explored (Vietnam, Nixon, JFK) is that this one is still going on, we don't know what will be of Snowden, and what real impact his leaking will really have. I hope it will be huge, but I doubt it. We know how the American establishment reacted to them, how they, again, flipped the narrative: it's really not that huge that it was revealed that the NSA spies on individual unsuspected citizens, Americans or not: Snowden is a villain because he threatened ""American security"" and that's much more important than any minor constitution related incidents. Apparently this version stuck, as we are a month away of having either Clinton or Trump sitting on the receiver side of the NSA bug So the ""security threat"" story is probably accepted by most Americans as true.<br/><br/>I think there is nothing ordinary about Snowden and what he did and because of that it struck me as a moderate insult that Stone would have him as a pretty standard American hero, the kind of stock character that has been feeding American mythology for decades and keeping the people (not only Americans) from looking under the rug, which is precisely what Snowden had us doing with his leaking. I mostly don't share many of Stone's political believes, but I've always respected his integrity, and sincere take on the important subjects he tackles. Check this film, it's honest. But base your narrative in more than one source. The breaking of the fiction, at the end, as the real Snowden speaks directly to us, is a good device to validate the narrative that we had so far been fed. Honesty."

","**Spoilers** I've been a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan since Third Rock from the Sun and he continues to expand his range with his pitch perfect performance of Ed Snowden. Oliver selected some excellent supporting cast members such as Zachary Quinto(Star Trek), Tom Wilkinson(Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and Timothy Olyphant(Deadwood) to name a few. Their performances unfortunately are forced to take a back seat to Nick Cage's brief but memorable performance. Whether you're a Cage fan or not, he draws you in with his mannerisms and for this tiny role he seemed to add a fair amount of flair including wafting cigarette smoke, having semi-bloodshot eyes, slamming beers and having gained weight as well. The script worked well enough but the pacing and effects seemed strained. Honestly I was surprised that this was an Oliver Stone film since it used rather cliché elements such as random mirrors placed nearby when Ed was in key decision making moments. Also the steam rising up clouding Ed's glasses while his stressful thoughts consumed him felt much like a film student's graduate project. <br/><br/>Not much creative risk taking being done in the making of this movie but the writers are betting on the fact that the magnitude of domestic espionage will scare the viewer into wanting to endure a long and rather two dimensional reveal of the deterioration of American's privacy and the ability to blackmail key power figures at home and across the globe based on the information collected. Like the atomic blast at the end of Predator, Oliver submits to using the real Ed to sing the song of freedom at the end and in a rather cringy way had fifty extras do a standing ovation to Ed's speech before the credits hit with a clunk.

"RLTerry1","7","0","5","23 September 2016"," Just when you thought you knew his story!
","Once again, acclaimed director Oliver Stone brings another socio-political issue and figure to the screen. Whether you're of the school of thought that Edward Snowden should be charged with espionage or heralded as a hero, this film will definitely challenge your point of view. But, isn't that what Stone is known for??? More than a docudrama of the life of Snowden, Stone's film is a dramatization of the state of government surveillance. One could argue that surveillance is the star of the film, not Snowden. The intent of the film is not to cast blame on either Snowden or the U.S. Government, but to cast doubt. The simple placement of doubt can be far more powerful than blatantly passing judgment or blame. If there was any 'doubt' that Stone is one of the most important filmmakers covering modern historic events, then this film will cast aside any remaining doubt. Few directors, have been so successful in taking cold, hard facts and transforming them into a story fit for cinema. The success of this film is attributed to the incredible lead talent. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley have excellent chemistry on screen. Accompanied by a strong cast of supporting players such as Zachary Quinto, Nicholas Cage, Scott Eastwood, Tom Wilkinson, and Melissa Leo, this film's cast will have your attention until the final fade to black.<br/><br/>Although this film has slow pacing, for those who are interested in the life of the–to borrow from J. Jonah Jameson–hero or menace, Stone's docudrama will successfully hook you and draw you into this world of intelligence. Snowden is a particularly interesting docudrama because this film essentially contains three smaller movies–a three legged stool if you will. There is the most dominant story of Snowden discovering the copious amount of secret government surveillance data being collected by his software. Next, we have the personal romantic story of the ups and downs of his relationship with the liberal, artistic, amateur photographer Lindsay Mills (Shailene Woodley) and how his professional life gently affected their relationship. And finally, the story that made Snowden a household name: his leaking and dissemination of top secret NSA surveillance methods and everything else Snowden knew about questionable NSA methods of collection. For most people, that third story is all anyone knows. But, in order to truly get an idea of the pressure Snowden must have been feeling, it is imprint to take the other two stories into account. That is precisely what Stone did with this film.<br/><br/>There are many excellent qualities in the writing and visual storytelling in this film, but there are two areas that appear to falter or suffer in the translation of these now historic events. The focus of the movie is definitely on what led Snowden to leak the NSA secrets, but there is a significant amount of time spent on the relationship between Snowden and Mills. One could argue that the strain of his relationship with Mills contributed to his eventual disclosure of the NSA secrets. Cinematically speaking, the strategic placement of the personal life of Snowden is important because the audience needs a break from the flat panel displays, computer code, and ""geek- speak."" Unfortunately, Stone and his co-writer Kieran Fitzgerald did not carefully contract and craft the personal dialog as well as they did the info tech and military dialog. In many ways, the forced personal story of the relationship between Snowden and Mills comes off as a forced element from producers to make the film more relatable to those who are not AS interested in the military side of the story and more interested in the outside/personal influences that affected Snowden's actions. It's not unlike fans wanting to know the personal details of a celebrity's life. Unfortunately, this human interest subplot does not play out as well as the two dominant stories at the forefront of this film. That being said, both Gordon-Levitt and Woodley are extremely committed to the characters/historic figures they are portraying.<br/><br/>The other area of this film that appears to suffer is the structure–the map, if you will. Any first year film student can tell you that flashback movies can be dangerous. Often times, the flashback is used as a copout plat device that simply plays off as lazy writing. From a technical perspective, a movie that uses the flashback as a means to tell the story is referred to as a nonlinear film. Now, I am not stating that Stone's movie is lazily written and structured; however, I do not feel that the constant back and forth between the past and then-present were handled delicately or strategically enough. Most of the time, one of the comments I have about movies that rely upon the flashback as a plot device to tell the story is 'Why is there a need for a flashback? Just let the main story BE the main story.' The flashback concept works for some films like The Notebook, Fried Green Tomatoes, or IT; but it does not work for others such as Ladder 49 or The Weight of Water. Most of the time, a flashback is used out of convenience to fill runtime; meanwhile, the audience usually doesn't care about the past as much as what is going to happen next in the present. Stone and Fitzgerald are mostly successful as keeping the audience entertained, caring about, and longing for what happens next in BOTH the past and present; however, I found the movie to go between both the present and past too much, almost to the point that it was a little confusing. Opening with Snowden and the small group of journalists was a great way to begin, but I feel that the story of Snowden would have been a little more gripping if we were able to watch the events from 2006 to 2013 unfold without present-day interruptions. Still, the ending that was selected for the film was both effective and strategic."

","Snowden: A packet of good bytes <br/><br/>Oliver Stone directs another political thriller, Snowden. <br/><br/>Director Stone reveals uncomfortable truths about the government in Snowden as movies like ""Salvador"", ""Missing"" and many films about the Vietnam war did. The film argues that it is patriotic to tell the truth about the spying the U.S. has done in the name of security and that the spying that interferes with our rights is unpatriotic. <br/><br/>Supporters of PRISM and the NSA spying argue that if you have nothing to hide, then you should not be worried about being spied on. Let's suppose that is true. Then the government should have nothing to hide regarding the surveillance of citizens of the U.S. and the world. Why are they afraid to let the U.S. citizens know about their surveillance programs if there is nothing wrong with it, if they have nothing to hide? It's not like foreign intelligence services don't already know they are being spied on and that the leaks let them in on a secret of some kind. What Snowden did was let the American people know about the spying, and that was a threat to many in the government. <br/><br/>The acting in ""Snowden"" is excellent. Gordon-Levitt has Snowden's vocal cadence and tone down. Quinto as Greenwald does well as does Leo as filmmaker Laura Poitras. The most powerful performance however, is Rhys Ifans who plays Snowden's mentor Corbin O'Brian. He is a great foil to Levitt's Snowden. He is charming, friendly and also threatening. Sometimes all at once. The actors playing Snowden's co-workers are also top notch as is Shailene Woodley as Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills. The film looks great using a variety of shots for a variety of purposes.<br/><br/>Negative critiques of the film find it ""fawning"" over Snowden. That's what happens in a biopic. Did these same critics complain about Spielberg's fawning over Lincoln? Did Spike Lee Fawn over Malcolm X? Or is the truth that they are judging the film by how they feel about Snowden himself? Snowden is apparently too controversial to deserve positive coverage, a film showing his actions as heroic. And what appears to gall some of these critics most is that Stone succeeds in making a case for Snowden as hero. <br/><br/>What is shown in the film is the extent to which we are being watched and tracked, the extent to which our lives are being monitored. This multi-billion dollar surveillance regimen of our citizenry has had little if any success in ending threats to our nation and hardly seems worth it. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you do it. However, few people know the fact of this, and if you make a film about Snowden, you better tow the party line and repeat the lies about his actions being a threat to national security of the outing of people. The facts are that Snowden never included the names of agents in his reports. Their names were redacted as were ongoing operations. What he revealed was the extent to which the government is watching us. <br/><br/>I disagreed with the choice of putting the real Snowden in the film at the end. I wonder if Stone thought this would make Snowden and his story more real to some of the audience. I also wondered if putting Snowden in the film with a couple of spoken lines earned him some extra money. Fine. And the seemingly glib smile on Snowden's face when he left his assignment in Hawaii seemed out of place to me. A ""Mona Lisa"" smile would have been more appropriate considering the gravity of the situation. <br/><br/>The film makes clear that the government abused our trust and that we must be constantly vigilant to protect our rights. <br/><br/>Rating: Pay full price. The acting is excellent on all counts and the film is dramatic throughout despite the slow start. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters<br/><br/>PS: Anyone who accepts the line ""The liberal media"" that Snowden used on his soon to be girlfriend in the film without questioning the premise that the media is liberal, isn't liberal."

","All we need is the idea of nudity and that can be well done. It's classier and broadens the audience reach. Then this could be a history movie for younger people. I always think nudity is NEVER needed in any movie. It will down grade the movie. For that I was going to give it a lower rate. Other then that it was very telling and the thoughts and purpose of the movie lingered for a long time which is always a sign of a good movie. Makes you think which most movies do nothing but take your money. It was very believable and done with enough suspense to keep you interested yet not so nervous you couldn't watch. I do not like having to shut my eyes during a movie because it is too much. I want to watch it all. It is very believable also as to why would a young, intelligent, man with so much going for himself leave everything behind unless he had GOOD cause. I thank him for exposing the wrong use of intelligence and making it clear that intelligence is vitally important in this hour of history but should have stricken guidelines."

","I saw ""Snowden"", Joseph Gordon-Levitt-The Walk, Halloween H20:20 Years Later; Zachary Quinto-Spock in the new Star Trek movies, American Horror Story_tv; Shailene Woodley-The Divergent movies, The Secret Life of the American Teenager_tv and Rhys Ifans-Alice Through the Looking Glass, Elementary_tv.<br/><br/>This is based on the true story about Ed Snowden, who leaked secrets to the press that he had taken while working for the NSA. You might have heard a little about it. He is living in Russia now, trying to avoid treason charges from America. There was never any doubt about what he did. The hitch is that the NSA, C.I.A.-and a lot of other agencies with initials-say that it is treason to leak sensitive, top secret info to the public, but the info that he leaked was that these agencies were spying on people, using their cell phones and personal computers- including American citizens-without there knowledge. It is known in some circles as illegal surveillance techniques. Joseph plays Snowden, Shailene plays his girlfriend, Zachary plays a reporter that helps break the story and Rhys plays one of Joseph's teachers in his C.I.A. training classes. The story covers 2004 through 2013, beginning with Joseph in basic training as a soldier. After an accident he joins the C.I.A. as a computer analyst-he had a high I.Q.-and then works his way through to the NSA. This is all kind of amazing since he dropped out of high school-because of financial reasons-and basically taught himself everything. It's directed by Oliver Stone, who has a reputation as a conspiracy enthusiast-so this is an interesting story, if it is all true. There are several good cameos; I remember seeing Timothy Olyphant, Scott Eastwood and Nicolas Cage in small but memorable roles. At the end of the movie the actual Snowden is shown in interview footage. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. I wouldn't buy it on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a great rental."

","Robbie K back for another review. This time we jump into the biographical/drama realm in the film of Snowden. The theme of this tale is on Edward Snowden, the former intelligence officer who quickly became a hot topic of debate in the span of five days by revealing the secrets of the government. So does this movie stand up to the hype, or will it be lost to the high flying tale of Sully that came out last week? Let's get to it!<br/><br/>LIKES:  Great acting  Decent pace on the story  Technical insight into spying<br/><br/>For a movie focused on one man, you need a good actor to portray the title character. So casting Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the key character was a brilliant move to say the least. Once more the man impresses me with his ability to capture a character's nuances and bring them to life. For someone in Snowden's environment you expect intelligence, moral dilemmas, and most likely some paranoia when dealing with classified secrets. Gordon-Levitt is able to portray it all, selling that he is a revolutionary programmer capable of changing the world one code at a time. He played geeky well, but he portrayed paranoid even better with all the symptoms common of the disorder. Shailene Woodley again gets the super dramatic role, trading revolutionary leader to concerned liberal girlfriendwho happens to be an exotic dancer/artist I give the girl props for her ability to maximize a limited part, selling the morals well in her short screen time. Everyone else is pretty much a government extra and adding intensity to the movie and making for big bad enemies. <br/><br/>When it comes to biographies, you often get very slow paced tales that tend to be overdramatized and slow for the most part. I didn't feel that way in Snowden, or at least I didn't feel that way most of the time. Snowden keeps the tale going, laying out the foundation of how Snowden fell into his predicament in all the glorious details. One will get immersed in all the technical details and moral dilemmas Edward went through, accompanied with the stress and suspense it brings with it. However, I do fear that such a movie may spur the flames of cyberterrorism with how people are inspired these days, but we won't hold that against the moviemuch. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Overdramatic at times  Slow at parts  One side portrayal of Snowden<br/><br/>The threat of having Hollywood portray your story is running the risk of movie magic overwriting fact. As there was a warning at the beginning of the film, safe to say there was a lot of dramatic intervention in this film. This does bring an entertaining factor, but it is a little disappointing to wonder what is fact and what is overdramatized fact. Some of the drama also gets a bit eye rolling at times and robs the film of the emotional punch they were trying for. <br/><br/>The excessive drama in the movie also makes for some slower moments that you may or may not appreciate. While much of the movie was pertinent to explaining Ed's rise, there were times when this got a little excessive. This was particularly true for meetings with certain supervisors, moments of jealousy and a delayed explanation of his ""flight"" that did little for me than extending the run time. Yes, these are minor dislikes, but editing could have cut a little more and save things for the director's cut of the film. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie took a one-sided approach to this story, focusing on making him a hero. I'm not calling him anything negative, but we all know that there are two sides to most tales and it would have been nice to get the antagonizing side of things. I'm giving the guys props for standing up for his morals, but I feel the drama portrayed things on a grandiose level than what actually happened. The result was making the government eviler, which will certainly split the favor of the audience depending on your like of the audience. A balanced approach may have expanded the audience liking, but hey to each his own.<br/><br/>The VERDICT Snowden certainly has the dramatic flair that will rope you into this story about the morals behind secrecy. His tale is certainly intriguing and most will appreciate the added spice the drama brings. This is certainly one of the better (and more entertaining) biographies I have seen, but most may not find it as gripping (or exciting) as the others. In addition, the one sided portrayal of this political topic may also curb your enjoyment of the movie so I again say take it with a grain of salt. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I can say only if you are looking for a biography or have strong interest in Snowden's story. I'd say save this one for a rental. <br/><br/>My scores:<br/><br/>Biography/Drama/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5"
