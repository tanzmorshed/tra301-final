","There is no doubt that THE AVIATOR is the masterpiece of both director Martin Scorsese and actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio becomes Howard Hughes. The actor is so profoundly absorbed in the role that the DiCaprio we know from other films cannot be found in this film. It is a bravura performance of great depth and magnitude. DiCaprio richly deserves his first Academy Award.<br/><br/>I have never know much about Howard Hughes. This film opened my eyes to him as a personality, a businessman, aviator and his lavish lifestyle. DiCaprio no longer is the ""pretty boy"" from other films. The expressions he takes on are not handsome, the deeply furrowed brow, one could actually watch him, as Hughes' character, think his way through challenging situations, the mark of a highly gifted actor. Watching DiCaprio evolve into the paranoid schizophrenic Hughes in the latter part of the film is a stunning example of pure acting. Leo deserves recognition for recreating a most difficult personality.<br/><br/>Though the film is long, it never slows down nor gets boring and it commanded my attention from start to finish. It is masterpiece cinema for these two men and for other actors too. Cate Blanchette must be commended for her role as Katherine Hepburn. Every role was played by first rate actors.<br/><br/>If you want to understand a piece of American history from the 30s through the 1940s, this film will illumine you. It may not be the greatest film ever made but it sure is cinema to the max and worth seeing, without a second thought."

","Scorsese has such an encyclopedic knowledge and understanding of cinema that every shot, however inventive and daring, is effortlessly composed. The direction, editing and cinematography are all the first-rate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best you'll see all year. Their efforts combine to create a world of rich and lavish color, of excitement and glamour. Who wouldn't want to visit THIS Cotton Club in 1935? It's hard to imagine who could trump the technical team for Oscars this year.<br/><br/>With such a perfectly realized world in which to perform, the actors universally do an outstanding job. Despite the criticism of the hardcore DiCaprio-haters, the unprejudiced will observe an excellent performance that takes genuine risks and convincingly conveys the passing of more than twenty years. Importantly, DiCaprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances. Blanchett's interpretation of Katherine Hepburn seems spot on, and anyone familiar with the late actresses mannerisms will appreciate the hard work that clearly went into the recreation. Alda, one of the most consistently underrated actors around, delivers another masterclass in restrained character building as he oozes ambition and political dishonesty from every pore.<br/><br/>And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorsese's ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it. We're never told how his experiences change him, and without change there's no journey. Considering the screenplay was written by John Logan, who usually displays a keen interest in showing the emotional evolution of his characters, the oversight is inexplicable. Ultimately then, much like Gangs of New York, The Aviator is simply the sum of it's parts, and however brilliantly those parts are realized, there doesn't seem to be a bigger theme to underpin and drive them.<br/><br/>The Aviator is a perfectly realized recreation of the era and one well worth experiencing. But the lack of a real emotional journey suggests 'all gloss and no substance', and ultimately prevents the movie from being truly great."
"Mister1045","10","506","705","17 December 2004"," A GREAT American TRAGEDY
","This is an astonishingly beautiful and moving film. Martin Scorcese has created a seminal work -- one that brings the harrowing, big-studio, adult movie making of the 1970's and totally reinvents and reinvigorates it for today's audience.<br/><br/>The story traces the rise and demise of billionaire Howard Hughes as he struggles to find meaning and purpose in a life unfettered by concerns of money, talent or opportunity. Whether trying to get a plane off the ground or a young starlet into bed, Hughes attacks life with a fierce gusto -- plagued and prodded by obsessive compulsive germphobia that constantly threatens to consume and defeat him.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is amazing! It's the performance no one thought he was capable of. It is a dynamic, smart, funny, articulate, intense, mature and ultimately harrowing performance that relaunches his career as one of American's finest actors. At the end of the film, you just want to take him in your arms and sob. It's really that good.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is incredible as Katherine Hepburn. At first, I was a little thrown by how bravely she attacked the Hepburn trademark voice, but I was completely won over by the second line. It is a tender, funny, incredibly convincing star turn that supplies the heart for the first half of the film. The scene where she takes Howard home ""for dinner"" with the family is a classic! Kate Beckinsale does a surprisingly fine job with Eva Gardner -- conveying the slow burning passion of this Hollywood icon without ever lapsing into mere mimicry.<br/><br/>But, in the end, this isn't a love story -- it's a war story -- a war between Howard's unstoppable will and his fierce inner demons battling for Howard's soul. It is the major relationship in the movie and the true heart of the film -- one that fuels his eccentric genius and yet constantly threatens to rip his life apart. He tries to ignore it by sleeping with every beauty in town. He tries to outrun it, building faster and faster airplanes. Yet, it is his one constant companion from early childhood to his ultimate, inescapable end. And it is this relationship that leaves you devastated at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Brilliant!"

","Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, ""The Aviator"" is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. ""The Aviator"" has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Hughes' life sentence is established in the opening scene. Hughes's mother while bathing the young Hughes, tells him something that perhaps leads to his obsessive compulsive nature. Apparently he is incomplete in his relationship with his mother, and the story surrounding what she said.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 1927, when Hughes left his father's wealthy drill bit tool company in Texas, to be a maverick film maker in California. Hughes is an ambitious and novice film director, but he is smart and has unmatched drive. However, his real genius is as a pilot and an innovative designer of airplanes. His gifts for fame and fortune are established. Hughes (DiCaprio) then pursues a touching romance with Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett). This is the highlight of ""The Aviator"", even amidst the spectacular aerial cinematography, because it is just about relationships that move people. There is a wonderful moment when Hughes lets Hepburn take control of his plane as they fly above Los Angeles at night. As great as the chemistry is between Dicaprio and Blanchett, this romance part of the story goes on a little too long in the context of the movie.<br/><br/>From this point on, the movie becomes increasingly darker. Sure, Hughes has his share of triumphs, but everything is tempered by his spiraling decline into depression and his debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder. The acting is outstanding throughout the picture. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's most mature performance. He truly captures Hughes's intensity, genius, and charm. His suffering also elicits great compassion. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Kate Hepburn. At first one wonders whether she is doing a caricature of Hepburn. She is not. She is being Hepburn. Blanchett's performance is simply stunning. An unrecognizable Kate Beckinsale is awesome as Ava Gardner. Beckinsale gives surprising layers to Gardner, who is really not all that she appears to be on the surface. John C. Reilly is fabulous as Hughes's CFO. In an understated fashion Reilly's performance anchors the movie. Alec Baldwin as Pan Am CEO, Juan Trippe, and Matt Ross as Hughes's engineer Glenn Odekirk give strong performances.<br/><br/>Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is spectacular to view, and has a sense of history and tragedy. He offers an interesting portrait of the dichotomy between genius and madness, with an emphasis on the dark. This choice really lost me. ""The Aviator"" is amazing work, that is not very inspiring, though it was probably not intended to do so. That is a bit of a disappointment."

","Leonardo Dicaprio, once again, shows his depth as an artist and his ability to carry a film. He deserves the Golden Globe, and his due as an outstanding actor.

The beginning scene set the pace for a journey into his privileged and dark world. The Aviator showed the torments and gifts of genius. Amazing job by all involved!

","This film is about the world famous multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. However, if the only thing you know about Hughes was that he was a recluse who secreted himself inside his hotel in Las Vegas and was obsessed with cleanliness, you may be in for a surprise. The film deals with Hughes' life before all that.<br/><br/>After a brief prologue showing Hughes as a child with his mother advising him on cleanliness, we move forward to 1927 with an adult Hughes (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) directing his hugely risky film ""Hell's Angels"". ""The Aviator"" takes in Hughes' film-making achievements, his romances with some of the most beautiful women of the day (including Katherine Hepburn (a superb Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale)) and his passion for aviation. The picture of Howard Hughes that emerges from the film is of a brilliant man who was a ruthless perfectionist, constantly risking ruin and even death for his goals. This all makes his eventual fate all the more sad.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly made, the cast are all very good in their roles (especially, as mentioned earlier, Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn) and despite lasting almost three hours, it is never dull. The main flaw, however, is that you never learn much about Hughes. Some more on his background would certainly have been welcome.<br/><br/>Any film by Scorsese, however, is worth seeing and this is no exception."
"WriterDave","8","96","142","22 January 2005"," An Interesting Muddle
","""The Aviator""--a biopic of Howard Hughes-- is clearly one of Scorsese's lesser works. Still, a lesser work from Scorsese is far superior to the greatest work of your average director. Here's the rundown:<br/><br/>The first quarter of the film is a total triumph, showing the young Hughes' bold endeavors in film when he produced what was at the time the most expensive and lavish film ever made. Scorsese tipping his hat to old Hollywood is the most fun he has had since ""Goodfellas."" The costumes, set designs, and pacing of this portion of the film are stunning and suck the viewer in.<br/><br/>The rest of the film, despite Scorsese's amazing and vivid attention to detail, is a muddled mess, giving us glimpses into Hughes' obsessive (and compulsive) ways, his womanizing, his ambitious foray into aviation and the early days of commercial flight, his fight against Congress at the end of WWII, and the notorious plight and ultimately single flight of his infamous ""Spruce Goose."" It's all semi-educational and semi-entertaining, but in the end I think the complicated life of Hughes remains a mystery.<br/><br/>As for the performances, they are amazing (thanks in most part to Scorsese, the ultimate actor's director). Leonardo Dicaprio in the title role gives yet another performance that goes against my natural loathing of him, and although he seems a bit too boyish playing Hughes in the latter years (and the film really suffers for it), he's impeccable for the better part of the film. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn is simply stunning and steals every moment she is on screen. Her look, her mannerisms, and her speech perfectly match the screen legend to a haunting degree. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin in supporting quasi-villain roles are methodically perfect. And the nicest surprise was Kate Beckinsale, a normally flaccid actress, playing Ava Gardner. She came across as gorgeous, intelligent, and maximized her minimal screen time without ever overtly stealing her scenes. Like Sharon Stone in ""Casino"" and Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York"" Scorsese once again coaxes a great performance out of an otherwise unremarkable pretty face. <br/><br/>In the end, ""The Aviator"" flies high thanks to Scorsese and the acting, even if the real person it depicts remains lost in a muddle of half truths and speculation."

","Leonardo D. was absolutely amazing. He was so accurate in the actions of someone with OCD. I have that disorder and he is so relatable. I know that the movie is about Howard Hughes (who was an absolute genius, even though he was a mad man), but Leo's performance was amazing. This is the movie that made people forget his role in Titanic and respect him as the amazing actor he is. I also really liked the costumes and music. The lipstick, the hair... again, they were right on for the period. Cate Blanchett made a perfect Katherine Hepburn. She was able to become the loud, powerful, intelligent woman that was Katherine Hepburn.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie yet you are truly missing out."
"gmorgan-4","8","281","454","6 December 2004"," Ambitious, Impeccably-Acted, DELIVERS
","Martin Scorsese's most recent ambitious project does not disappoint.<br/><br/>I just saw this film in a special preview for NYU film students, with Martin Scorsese there to discuss and answer questions after, and I must say, it was pretty phenomenal. It is Martin Scorsese's best work since Goodfellas (this is obvious) and most probably his best work since Raging Bull. DiCaprio's character study of Howard Hughes, and his devotion to this role, is exquisite and reminiscent even of Robert De Niro's in Raging Bull. The film is lengthy, but this compliments it, for the story is riveting and the production is practically flawless (even the combination of computerized processes and more traditional photography was smooth and effective).<br/><br/>The presentation of the film, in an evolving color (from two-tone Technicolor, as Martin explained it to us, to three-tone, to modern by the later sequences) is absolutely stunning, and the cinematography by renowned Robert Richardson, ASC, is some of the best I've seen (and, in my opinion, deserving of an Oscar).<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett was impeccable as Katharine Hepburn, though, at times, I felt that the complexity of her character was never really deeper than a surface analysis.<br/><br/>She did her role flawlessly, but this is not to say that it really Alec Baldwin portrayed one of the flattest villains I've seen in a major motion picture, but, again, this is about Howard Hughes, and DiCaprio's performance is worthy of an Oscar nod at least, and perhaps an Oscar Win (certainly the best performance I've seen all year).<br/><br/>One of my few complaints, though, is the lengthy sequences featuring Howard Hughes as a solo aviator. Though interesting, entertaining even, the film was long enough already, and did not require such an exhaustive analysis of individual flight procedures.<br/><br/>Also, it seems that some of the themes were almost too redundant, such as the ways in which Hughes' psychological problems were performed. Much of the Hollywood history is good, even interesting, but it also sometimes seemed a bit self-indulgent, to the point where you questioned the necessity of ALL of those nightclub sequences in the film.<br/><br/>But, besides those relatively few complaints, it is a spectacular film.<br/><br/>In all: do not miss it.<br/><br/>3.5/4"
"nycritic","9","23","31","14 December 2005"," Obsessively Watchable.
","Not many directors can say that their film-making careers haven't become as predictable as the next day, and for all its ups and downs and questionable choices, Martin Scorcese, with or without an Academy Award for Best Director, can stand proud and say that he is one of those few who have made at least one stellar film per decade since he began making films in the 1970s and continues making high-quality films for the serious moviegoer. Or, as it could be said, he makes the films he wants to make whether they become critical successes or failures.<br/><br/>Coming out of GANGS OF NEW YORK he decides to film this biopic about media dinosaur Howard Hughes at a time when the average moviegoer is more interested in the likes of Paris Hilton and her increasingly cretinous presence which has nothing to bring to society except smutty videotapes. In a year filled with biopics, THE AVIATOR is an important one, if trivially flawed, because in taking such a character and without sentiment analyzing his truly remarkable but ultimately tragic life he achieves a sharper view. Leonardo diCaprio as Howard Hughes does not have even a remote physical resemblance to the actual man, but there was no doubt in my mind that he was Hughes from head to toe. It's as if he studied Hughes through film reels because he gets him right and that makes his performance multi-dimensional. Watch a short, apparently unimportant scene with a bar-waitress early in the film and see how this establishes who he is in relation to women, what he thinks of them. Watch how diCaprio brings Hughes obsession with perfection and cleanliness to life: in film-making, in building the perfect plane. And watch those testosterone-fuled sequences in which Hughes breaks aviation records (almost killing himself at one point).<br/><br/>It can be said that THE AVIATOR is divided into two parts: The first half, which focuses on Hughes relationship with screen icon Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), and the second half which takes off from where she leaves and his obsessive-compulsive disorder, previously kept under control (suggesting she gave him some stability), comes flooding through unmonitored. During the first half of the movie DiCaprio and Blanchett create a perfect pair of social outcasts, and had the film ended there, this would have been a powerfully tragic love story. I got the sense, without reading Kate's autobiography, that these two really loved each other and were each other's complement. Hepburn's mercurial approach to Hughes must have obviously intoxicated him, and I could perceive (through Blanchett's flawless conveyance of Hepburn) that she was intrigued by this odd man, and of course, being so cerebral, she felt compelled to getting to know him. However, their differences could not have been better reflected in the disastrous scene when Hughes meets Hepburns family and though they remained together a bit longer, his womanizing was the cause for her abandonment of him and the gut-wrenching sequence in which be burns his clothes and orders work associate Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to buy him more.<br/><br/>The second half doesn't lag. It does feel a little episodic, but Scorcese manages to make transitions smooth, while introducing players in the latter part of his life, such as Ava Gardner, Juan Trippe, and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. As the case with many of Scorcese films, length and editing is an issue, and reducing the inclusion of starlet Faith Domergue would have been preferable, but again, Scorcese is making the film he chooses to make and this is really a quibble in my behalf, because soon later Hughes is back in action defending his usage of his own money during the war against accusations from Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, playing him like a snake). No punches are also thrown when the aforementioned OCD kicks in and Hughes starts to see things and becomes a virtual recluse, urinating into glass jars and watching the same movie over and over again (the movie in question was not THE OUTLAW as seen here, but the usage of this archive footage seems appropriate since it sums up his attitude toward women and a lost love in Kate Hepburn). Here is when DiCaprio really sinks his teeth into his role in making Hughes a broken man unable to cope with his madness and needing to defend himself against Brewster and Trippe.<br/><br/>Regardless to minor character inconsistencies and half-told story lines and that many of the actors look nothing like their real-life counterparts (i.e. Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and a glaringly miscast Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner), THE AVIATOR is solid entertainment and highly recommended to anyone who loves old movies and old Hollywood."

","Before Howard Hughes was a recluse so reclusive as to out-Salinger J.D. Salinger, he was a big time stud, who made big movies, flew fast planes, and courted gorgeous ladies; so say Martin Scorsese and John Logan, architects of this latest Hollywood biopic.' Leonardo DiCaprio continues his trend of turning in great performances with great directors, playing Howard Hughes between 1927 and 1947, the years where Hughes conquered the worlds of film and aviation, making room for romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). In later years, Hughes's mental problems would become legendary; at this stage in the game, he suffers only from pronounced germ phobia and mild obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is all expertly depicted by Scorsese, Logan, and DiCaprio. Stealing all her scenes is Cate Blanchett, who should start making room on her mantle for her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. It couldn't have been easy to play an iconic movie star like Katharine Hepburn, but Blanchett aces it. Kate Beckinsale, Kelli Garner (Faith Demorgue), and Gwen Stefani (Jean Harlow) are the other women in Howard's life, although none are as clearly defined as Blanchett/Hepburn. The villains of the piece are Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, playing, respectively, Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe and Trippe's bought-and-paid-for politician, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Both excel, with Alda coming off as both slimy and goofy at the same time. Alec Baldwin, like Cate Blanchett, steals every scene he has, playing Trippe as a delightfully suave villain. In his final scene he delivers a wonderful monologue on the future of Hughes's Trans-World Airline, and caps it off with the most hysterical use of the F word in many years. Also appearing: the dependable John C. Reilly as Hughes's business manager Noah Dietrich; Jude Law, who apparently can't go two weeks without seeing himself in a different movie, as movie legend Errol Flynn; Brent Spiner (yay!) as airplane executive Robert Gross; and Willem Dafoe as a photographer. ""The Aviator"" is overlong, and drags in places, but it is a great movie. I rate it a 9/10."
"Brogan","10","133","229","14 December 2004"," Perhaps the best movie of 2004!
","Leave it to Martin Scorsese, he is one of the few reliable directors who graces in age, still manages to make outstanding movies. I thought his previous film; GANGS OF NEW YORK was the best film of 2002 (and still stand by that comment). Scorsese who was once known for showing us the gritty realistic world of New York City's ""Mean Streets"" with the Little Italy thugs (MEAN STREETS), anti-hero loners (TAXI DRIVER), fallen hero (RAGING BULL), bizarre world of Soho (AFTER HOURS), realistic thugs (GOODFELLAS), gangsters controlling Las Vegas (CASINO; it wasn't in NYC, but it still had the similar theme), guilt ridden paramedic (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), and the war between immigrants (GANGS OF NEW YORK). This is the Scorsese that all of us know about and remember. Yet Scorsese was also responsible for telling us about a single mother in the southwest struggling to survive (ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE), the final farewell concert of a fantastic rock/folk group The Band (THE LAST WALTZ), and the story of Jesus Christ (LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ). Now Scorsese has become the storyteller of one of the most enthusiastic and eccentric billionaires of recent years, Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>In THE AVIATOR, Scorsese portrays Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) as several different roles: filmmaker, womanizer, entrepreneur, engineer, germ-phobic, and aviator. The film tells about the achievements that Hughes accomplished such as the movies HELL'S ANGELS & THE OUTLAW, the building of an airplane that can fly above 20,000 feet, acquiring TWA and making it a international airline, and the design and building of the largest airplane ever the Hercules (now known as the Spruce Goose). Yet Hughes went through so many conflicts with his business: Pan Am Airline chief Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), Maine Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), Louis B. Mayer (Stanley DeSantis); his romance: Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsdale); and himself: paranoia, and obsession compulsion disorder.<br/><br/>THE AVIATOR discusses all of those elements in rich detail, that after watching the movie, you begin to realize the amazing accomplishments that Hughes did. Wonder why the only thing we most remember about Hughes was being a recluse who was afraid of germs. And would like to know more about Howard Hughes and see the films that were discussed in the film.<br/><br/>This isn't a Scorsese film that people want another TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, or RAGING BULL would expect. This is a different kind of Scorsese, one who is telling a story about a man, who is no different that him. A dreamer who dreams big and ignores what his advisors, and partners tell him, then come up with projects with amazing results. <br/><br/>DiCaprio proves that he his under-appreciated actor in this film. While most of the public see him as that goofy kid who shouts, ""I'm king of the world!"" in TITANIC. Yet most don't realize his talent with such roles as in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. THE AVIATOR shows that DiCaprio is a great actor, giving a realistic portrayal of the eccentric Hughes in some scenes, and a man who cleanses the germs that represent people he dislikes or negative incidents. Blanchett does a amazing job with her performance of Katherine Hepburn with the way her head is tilted back to the pronunciation of words to the snobbish like personality she has when she is around her parents. While Beckinsdale also does a great job playing the very sexy Ava Gardner who has a love/hate relationship with Hughes, a woman who hates him at times, but will help him when he needs help.<br/><br/>The supporting performances by John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Danny Huston, and Matt Ross are all top rate and also deserve recognition as well.<br/><br/>And Scorsese proves that he one of the best directors of all time with several elements. First the pacing of the story, the film never drags and at running time of 169 mins. it kept my attention on what was going to be happening next. Second, some of the scenes of the film were of complete beauty and wonder. One scene that blew my mind was during the filming of the aerial scenes from HELLS ANGELS which showed how dangerous it was filming the dogfight scenes from that film, seventy years before computer generated images would replace that technique. Third, the acting by the actors was top notch and very convincing. Finally, the story of Howard Hughes himself was unique and original and I think there will never be another person like Howard Hughes. <br/><br/>This has been quite a year of movies: COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, KILL BILL VOL. 2, THE INCREDIBLES, RAY, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, THE TERMINAL, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, BOURNE SUPREMENCY, OCEANS TWELVE, CRIMINAL, SPIDER-MAN 2, MEAN GIRLS, HARRY POTTER & PRISONER OF AZKABAN, and SPANGLISH were all films that were amazing and all were among my favorite films of this year (yet I still need to see LIFE AQUATIC and FINDING NEVERLAND). But I think it will be hard to beat THE AVIATOR, for it's story, characters, and epic feel. <br/><br/>The Academy has snubbed Scorsese for 30 years; they did the same thing for Roman Polanski until THE PIANIST. Now I think its time for the Academy to acknowledge Scorsese for his craft and technique. While some people will believe that Scorsese should have won his Oscar back in 1980 with RAGING BULL, or in 1990 with GOODFELLAS, I feel that it's time to recognize Scorsese for something! And THE AVIATOR is one film that I think that most Scorsese devotees (like myself) feel is worthy of recognition. Plus, if this movie wins both Best Director and Best Picture, then two of my favorite directors will win Oscars (Scorsese and Michael Mann, who produced AVIATOR).<br/><br/>So that is why I am rooting and hoping that THE AVIATOR will collect Oscar gold. The best movie of the year, and don't miss it!!!!! ***** (Out of five)"
"mem_ory","6","132","234","25 December 2004"," Disappointing
","The Aviator like the Spruce Goose itself only takes flight briefly and is an overall disappointment. The thrills to be had are in the flight sequences. However they are done digitally and in the editor's suite. Scorsese's hand is rather flat on the throttle and the script plays too broadly. You get the feeling that Scorsese himself is not quite in love with his subject, Howard Hughes. The scenes that should work such as Hughes caressing the rivets of a plane are seen through a cynical eye. DiCaprio portray's Hughes as a nut and sociopath. Maybe he was in real life but it's as if they want you to not like this guy. Not exactly the right approach to making an audience friendly picture. We also have a poor sense of continuity. After suffering massive wounds from a plane crash, Howard Hughes heals up amazingly well and quickly. Totally glanced over is the fact that he became addicted to morphine after this event. If 75% of your body is burned and your heart has been dislocated to the other side of your chest cavity I think you're going to care more about killing the pain instead of washing your hands.<br/><br/>I can't help but think that James Cameron would of been a more apt choice to make this film. I believe his sensibilities are more in line with Howard Hughes. He would of portrayed Hughes as more of a Ayn Rand type character than a tragically flawed anti-hero."

","Scorsese does it again with this period piece detailing the life of the eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio). The film opens with Howard directing his 1930 war epic, ""Hell's Angels."" Which took 3 years and 4 million dollars to make (not a small chunk of change back then, not even that small now). The movie moves to his meeting and subsequent courting of Katharine Hepburn, played exceptionally well by Cate Blanchett. It also depicts him moving on to the likes of Ava Gardner and Faith Domergue. ""The Aviator"" shows us the many aspects of Hughes' being, both good and bad. He is a dreamer, sparing no expense to make his movies or build his aviation empire, despite the financial trouble it causes the company which he inherited from his family that is based in Houston (the name of the company escapes me. We also see his obsessive compulsive nature, afraid of contracting germs and constantly trying to stay as clean as possible. When Errol Flynn grabs a pea off of Hughes' plat with a nice cut of meat on it, Hughes pushes it aside with only one bite gone. Also, Hughes is contracted by the government to make fighter planes and an ""air-boat,"" a giant airplane that can transport the troops, their equipment, and transportation across the Atlantic so that German u-boats will stop taking down U.S. submarines and ships. He call's it ""The Hercules."" The project takes too long, and it isn't completed in time to help in the war. Well, Hughes' new airline TWA doesn't amuse the big wigs at Pan Am Airlines, so their owner uses his personnel senator (Leon Brewster of Maine) to get a bill before Congress to put a monopoly on international aviation travel. Hughes takes on Brewster and his hearing and wins, then he takes the maiden voyage of his ""Spruce Goose,"" as Brewster called it, and retires the vessel forever. If you didn't know who Hughes was before this movie, then it will give you a great foundation on which to build knowledge of this quite intelligent, quite intriguing man. DeCaprio turns in a superb performance, further distancing himself from his teeny-bopper early years. He has definitely changed my opinion of him with his last three movies (Gangs of New York, Catch Me If You Can, and The Aviator). I realize he might have been good in earlier movies (though don't you dare say ""Basketball Diaries,"" which sucked), but I haven't seen them all."

","I went to see this movie with very high expectations. It was supposed to be a certain Best Picture nominee that would finally get Scorcese his Best Director Oscar, and possibly the best picture Oscar too. Given the history of the Oscars, it will not surprise me if Scorcese wins the Oscar for his not so good effort. IMO neither the movie nor the direction lives upto the hype. Half way through the movie, I was bored to death. When it finally ended, with DiCaprio saying the same sentence 20+ times (it was quite irritating), I heaved a sigh of relief. There is too much detail, not enough pace, and the screenplay is nothing to write home about. There is some good acting, which may be the only saving grace of this movie. Dicaprio brings out the eccentricity of the main character quite well, but the story never really takes off. One good scene in the movie is when the Howard Hughes character has to defend himself. Leo carried that scene well. Overall, a HUGE disappointment."

It will obviously win Oscars, this is just the niche that the Academy voters are looking for, and I'll bet that it makes a pretty penny....but it sort of reminds me of ""The Last Emperor"" which I have never felt deserved a ""Best Picture"" Oscar in that there is minimal involvement asked of the viewer and a feeling of Who cares??? I disagree that it is a ""must-see"" depending on how much time and energy is available to you, the viewer. I found the other major's of 2004 to be much more involving, particularly ""Finding Neverland"", Spanglish, Sideways and Closer.

","﻿ The Aviator is about aviation innovator Howard Hughes. It is about womanizer Howard Hughes. It is about psychopath Howard Hughes. Any one of these would have made an interesting film. Altogether they resulted in a shallow portrayal over too long a period of time to retain my interest. In short, I was bored.<br/><br/>Let's look at the love affairs. The bit about Jean Harlow was so minuscule it could easily have been cut with no harm to the biography. The same could be said about the scenes with Faith Domergue. The Ava Gardner story could have been interesting, but it was too fragmented to be of interest. Only the Kate Hepburn story was truly compelling, mostly because of the exceptional performance of Cate Blanchett. Still, even this episode  which could have been developed into a two-hour story  left me wanting.<br/><br/>Then, there's the psycho-pathological element. Who was his mother and why did she treat him like she did? We don't know. Was this a sexually abusive relationship? The opening bath scene leaned in that direction, but we don't know. If Hughes was so horrendously phobic, why did the phobia take so long to emerge and wreck his life? We don't know. It's a shame the writer and director did not reveal the answers to these questions. Perhaps no one knows the answers; we just know he was psychopathic.<br/><br/>Finally, let's talk about aviation. I love airplanes. I could relate to Hughes' passion. I could thrill with his gallivanting around the skies  racing, filming, testing, wooing Hepburn. I didn't even mind the fact that nothing in the air was real  just computer generated images. I wanted to stand by his side when he faced off with greedy Juan Trippe and sleazy Senator Owen Brewster. I wanted to fight with him and fight for him. But even this was shallowly presented. The evidence is readily apparent: major characters, identified by labels as if this were a documentary, enter the story without the viewer being prepared for who they are, why they are there, and why we should care about them. I just couldn't get hooked. I didn't care.<br/><br/>Interesting note: when I was first out of college, I worked as a technical writer with a man who was nearly at the end of his career. He had been with Hughes Aircraft and had the dubious honor, along with three or four others, of pulling Hughes from one of his many plane crashes. My fellow employee told tales of Hughes and of the rescue for which Howard ensured him of employment for as long as he wanted to stay on.<br/><br/>Sadly, The Aviator added nothing to my knowledge of Howard Hughes and, although it had great potential to tell a fabulous story about one of aviation's most celebrated innovators, it failed."

","I can never see Leonardo DiCaprio as a man. He will always look like a scrawny, little guy. He just does not come across as an adult in this film any more than he did in Titanic. Young girls like him, which is why Titanic made so much money since all those young girls went to see him over and over. I wonder if it will happen here. Leo, please keep your clothes on. It only makes you look more like a kid. The cinematography is wonderful and very controlled as the film progresses. The Howard Hughes character is not delved into enough in order for the viewer to see the mental breakdown of a very eccentric man. Three hours and his disturbing actions did not seem credible. He is crazed and living behind locked doors. Then he is cleaned up and very lucid before all the flash bulbs at the Senate hearings. For someone who was in such poor emotional condition, it was difficult to buy the transformation. Cate Blanchette was wonderful as Hepburn. She nailed that role with her own twist to it. As an Aussie playing the varied roles she has chosen, she always seems to rise to each. I hope one day she will be recognized for her great talent. Ian Holmes is always good and made a wonderful professor. Kate Bechinsale did a fine piece tender, yet tough, acting the part of Ava Gardner. She didn't mimic the iconic late star, but took on the role in her own tempered manner. Scorcese is a wonderful filmmaker whom I greatly admire. However, this attempt at a very long film led nowhere. I kept wanting the film to give me more depth of the Hughes character and felt squirmy in my seat. Possibly the miscasting of DiCaprio was part of the problem, but the back story and the slow progression into mental illness needed to be explored more deeply. Again, I can't say enough about the cinematography. I do hope that brings in an Oscar."

There's absolutely no mention that Hughes gave Hepburn the money to buy the movie rights to the Broadway hit ""The Philadelphia Story,"" which turned her career around for good. Blanchett may well be the first actor or actress to win an Oscar for playing another Oscar winner, and would well deserve it.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale (qv) as Ava Gardner (qv) is as radiant as the real thing but if this part of Hughes' life wasn't in the movie as written I would never have missed it.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio (qv) fills the screen like he always does, but not even his star quality and his talent don't make up for the movies meanderings from the plot. His gives and takes with Alan Alda (qv) as Senator Harry Reid are well enough, but it's like watching a rehearsal instead of a finished product. Alec Baldwin (qv) as Juan Trippe, the boss at Pan AM, seems to be grateful to phone in his character from GlenGarry Glen Ross (1992) _(qv)_.<br/><br/>The airplane scenes, whether flying, building or even just talking technicals, held me in place.

"moonspinner55","5","128","251","25 December 2004"," Dark and dour; a saga, not an epic...
","Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biography flies high and mighty when it does indeed fly--down on the ground, it's aloof, cold, a little slow, but you get the impression that Scorsese doesn't notice. He's an extremely self-satisfied filmmaker and doesn't bother to pick up the pace. He should have. When Hughes begins to deteriorate, the movie gets bogged down in the same red-tinged psychological muddle that doomed the entire midsection of ""New York, New York"". The period flavor--as with ""New York""--is careful but disappointing, and Leonardo DiCaprio is serviceable in the lead but nothing grander, nothing more than workman-like (his little boy voice strains throughout, cussing like a kid playing grown-up; his height doesn't detract however, and his weight and demeanor seem very correct). Cate Blanchett playing Katharine Hepburn is too fast at the beginning, but finds a more appropriate style; unfortunately, there's too much of her, and Scorsese's lighting fast editing fails him in this instance. We don't need to see Hepburn arriving at the movie studio, turning the lights on and meeting a handsome admirer. Whose story is this? The sequence around the Hepburn family dinner table is, however, a smash, and Blanchett is lovely in her period wardrobe. I didn't believe for a second the impersonations of Jean Harlow (very minor) or Ava Gardner (a big problem) ...and what happened to the ""Outlaw"" controversy? It seems to take place off-screen. The editing also slips in the final third, allowing scenes to run on too long, letting shots get ahead of themselves (as with DiCaprio behind the wheel of the Hercules, seeming to turn the plane too early). The music is great, the cinematography terrific, the thing LOOKS good. But it's a great big lump of expensive coal. ** from ****"
"alee-13","3","97","188","9 January 2005"," A very long movie with disappointingly shallow depth.
","After seeing The Aviator, I disagree with the majority of people, who seem to adore the film. Its director, Martin Scorsese, is no doubt one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, but he has stumbled again with this film (following Gangs of New York).<br/><br/>The film's begins by showing one puzzling scene of Howard Hughes' as a child being bathed by his mother and then it jumps to a scene showing Hughes as a young man directing a movie, Hell's Angels. This 'jumping' from scene to scene with little or no explanation happens quite often in The Aviator and I think it may have been necessary to keep the running time below 10-hours. Aside from Leo and Cate Blanchet, many other characters in the movie are introduced with subtitles or never introduced to the audience at all. It seems Scorsese thought anyone besides Hughes and Hepburn are not worth the director's efforts. The movie SEEMS to contain many interesting subplots: Hughes' interest in Hollywood movie-making, relationships with Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, etc., his quest to build the fastest planes, battling PAN AM and corrupted politicians, building a corporate empire (dream), and fighting the inner demons, which eventually destroy's his life. However, none of the plots are explained with any interest and the story skims only the plots' surface with no effort to grab the attention of the audience (at least not mine).<br/><br/>If an audience is not familiar with the life and times of Howard Hughes, Katherine Hepburn, Eva Gardner, and the evolution of commercial airlines in the U.S., then it is almost impossible to see any depth in this movie.<br/><br/>Sure, the set designs and acting of Leo and Blanchet are above-par in the film, but most others aspects of this film are in such a mess! It seems as if Martin Scorsese (and the writer) assumed every audience coming to theaters to watch The Aviator would already be fascinated by Howard Hughes' eccentric life. The story in the movie has no beginning or and no ending! It starts abruptly and ends abruptly.<br/><br/>Although the film spends nearly three hours concentrated solely on Howard Hughes' success and his inner demons of life, I walked out of the theater with a feeling that I've just watched an expensively designed movie with no real content. It really is a shame to spend that much money to make a movie that long only to miss the mark completely. Howard Hughes' life story must be very interesting to have drawn so much money and top talents, but then why is The Aviator so flat and boring? Well, it's simply a not well-made movie.<br/><br/>I miss the RAGING BULL, GOOD FELLAS, CASINO, CAPE FEAR... and I wish Mr. Scorsese would go back to making highly entertaining movies with DeNiro. THE AVIATOR (and GANGS OF NEW YORK) is a sub-par quality by the director's great standard."
"tedg","Null","73","140","4 January 2005"," Three Characters
","We all live in our own movies, and particularly like movies of people who do so more literally. Here are three in one film:<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese: My regular readers know that I have been very critical of his films. Sure, they are crafted well enough, but the world he created was not one worth visiting. His films until recently were of the Italian storytelling school which focuses on characters. Those characters do not inhabit their worlds as much as create them. Scorsese's camera, therefore, was affixed to people, almost by a visible thread.<br/><br/>But those of us who watch film seriously know that there is nothing but empty darkness just outside the camera's eye. There's no world, so there can be no God, or fate, or luck or whatever material you imagine fills the river of life. He knows it is a cheat as well and has said so. Just like many other fabulously successful filmmakers who know their work is hollow, in his later years he's tried to mature... to master a greater notion of creation.<br/><br/>""Gangs"" was a success in this regard though an unfinished film because the Weinsteins pulled the plug. It marked a completely different approach to space and context, and I applauded it. Now he actually finishes a movie in the new style. Though this is a story of a man, it is no longer anchored to the man. The camera is now Orson Welles' camera with shots of the space with people in it. So obvious is some of this that when Hughes first retreats, he stays out a room that inexplicably (and unhistorically) has strings tied from hither and yon from objects. Take another look at that room and see all of Scorsese's old camera angles. I think we can welcome Scorsese now as the best new filmmaker of the year. This is as much his story as Hughes'.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett: Cate is one of three actresses alive who can fold her acting, meaning that she can simultaneously deliver two characters in the same motions. She's at the top of her game here (while Julianne is devolving with an apparently thick husband). Hepburn was an amazing actress, deeply untalented in the conventional measures but capable of engineering her surroundings to suit. Her engineering of the ""Philadelphia Story"" persona is Hollywood legend. She engineered a character that worked, then stepped into it. The old Scorsese would have hired someone like Streep to play Hepburn and lumbered around after her. <br/><br/>The new Scorsese allows Cate to flower and willingly supports the folding: an actress (Cate) playing a character (Kate) who is playing a character. You can see all the conduits of control, all the taught strings at two levels. God, what a great time to be alive!<br/><br/>Howard Hughes: The movie gave the impression that Howard simply inherited his money. No so. He was a brilliant engineer who famously codesigned systems and the engineering organizations to support them. While most of us were barfing at frat parties, he designed a drill bit (often credited to his father) that is still the standard in the industry, together with a set of screw connections that has since become the international standard. That's where the money came from. And though he went loopy toward the end, he ensured that 100% of his wealth (yes, all assets were sold) went to endow the world's largest private research institute. <br/><br/>This was a passionate engineer in a world of monopolistic thugs (Gates take notice), truly what we like to think the ""free market"" is all about. The movie also ignores a key movie connection: He always intended the ""Spruce Goose"" to be made of wood, and because all US manufacturing assets were committed, he designed a production system that allowed small businesses, even backyard groups, to make pieces that would be floated down rivers and successively be glued into larger parts. This (what he called the ""packet production system"") was the first serious research into what we today call ""virtual enterprises.""<br/><br/>When the war ended, he sent his virtual enterprise experts into his film business where they used the system (freely giving away details) to destroy the vertically integrated studio system. Nearly all movies today use his virtual enterprise approach and the Weinsteins (producers of this very film) are the current masters of the system. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"peter-991","5","92","180","29 December 2004"," Not Scorcese's best film
","Not Martin Scorcese's best film. Almost cartoonish with over rich colors and overacting. However, the costumes and sets were wonderful. Short and baby faced Leonardo DeCaprio was grossly miscast and seemed to know it and consequently overplayed his part and his squeaky voice grated. Only during the Senate hearings in 1947 did he look like Howard Hughes. John C. Reilly always succeeds and was great as Noah Dietrich. Alec Baldwin was terrific as Juan Trippe, the head of Pan American Airlines, and Alan Alda was just fantastic as Maine Senator Ralph Brewster, the corrupt Republican (are there any other kind?) in the pocket of Juan Trippe and PanAm. Cate Blanchett could not have been better as Katharine Hepburn. Kate Beckinsale was okay as Ava Gardner but didn't have the cachet. The movie ended with Hughes' descent into madness in 1947-1949 and did not include any of the scenes of the Sands Hotel days when he had long fingernails and long hair. He owes his obsessive compulsive disorder to his mother, who ""washed"" his penis when he was an adolescent, which is the disturbing and totally unnecessary opening scene.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie were (1) fantastic airplanes and old cars throughout, (2) Hughes' amazing survival of a spectacular crash of an experimental plane into palatial homes in Beverly Hills, (3) the takeoff and flight of the Spruce Goose, (4) the Senate hearings, (4) the night time flight over LA with Hughes romancing Hepburn, (5) dinner with Katharine Hepburn's family in New England, and (5) the crash landing of another experimental plane in a beet field. Worth it just for those scenes. The film was marred by about 30 to 40 minutes of boring scenes that seemingly would never end of Hughes going mad, urinating into milk bottles, compulsive hand washing, muttering to himself, etc.<br/><br/>Certainly not a film to see a second time, which is always the mark of a good film for me. A movie nearly 3 hours long can not drag and this film sure as hell dragged. With the exception of Alda, Baldwin, O'Reilly and Blanchett, most of the young actors and actresses had no idea who they were playing. The film failed to show the importance of Hughes's role in the aviation, oil and film industries."

I had to close my eyes quite a lot during the film.<br/><br/>But worst of all was the treatment -- a story totally without soul. It's fair to compare it with Franco Zeffirelli's recent ""Callas Forever"" which was a touching tribute full of love for the subject matter. There was none of that in Aviator.

","My father worked for Hughes Aircraft for over 30 years, so our family was especially interested in seeing this film about Howard Hughes. I enjoyed seeing the cinematography in this film. It was very nicely shot, especially the night scenes. However, I felt that the film's shots were overall too long. Confrontation scenes between Howard Hughes and Katherine Hepburn went on too long as did scenes showing Howard Hughes' neurosis (hand washing, being distracted by camera flashes and lens changes). I felt that to see a little bit of this was enough, but each scene seemed to be played out much longer than was needed to bring home the point. I also felt that too much time was spent with Howard Hughes' relationships with women (especially Katherine Hepburn) and not enough time showing each of the successes that Howard Hughes had in his career, especially aviation. I think that the prologue should have started out with his father inventing the oil drill bit that was patented. This would have been a better visual explanation of how the family got it's money. It's only alluded to in the film, but it would have been better to have shown this to create a foundation for the family money. I found myself squirming at times because I wanted the film to move more rapidly out of scenes."

","There is several related but distinctive ways to present a life history. Here are just five of them:<br/><br/>1. Fiction: As in Jack London's autobiographical, ""Martin Eden."" This calls for the engagement of story elements where a protagonist is introduced, conflict results from his or her personality and life choices and the conflict is resolved with the effect of having the character changed. <br/><br/>2. Panorama: As in David Lean's unforgettable ""Lawrence of Arabia"" where the subject becomes the pivotal instrument of a historical event and epic magnitude is attained. <br/><br/>3. Pageant: As in Richard Attenborough's memorable Gandhi where the subject actually creates history within the presentation of a story and that story once again reaches epic importance. <br/><br/>4. Chronicle: As in Sunrise at Campobello, the story Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or The Spirit of St. Louis, on the Charles Lindbergh flight. <br/><br/>5. Tabloid: Where a laundry list of yellow press reportage is woven into continuity. <br/><br/>Aviator is the last of these. Here is a by-the-numbers presentation of tabloid headline stories fleshed into sometimes interesting dialogue but never revealing the depths of the man except for one odd, unexplored scene from his childhood with his mother. Nor does the film adequately present Hughes' remarkable influence on the history of aviation. Instead it's tossed off in a casual style except for the depiction of some of his dramatic adventures in aviation while his early career in Hollywood is presented as an exaggerated, frenzied comic strip. <br/><br/>Another curiosity, not a single one of the selected actors in the film bears the slightest resemblance to the celebrity being played. For example, Jean Harlow is played by an ethnic, Mediterranean type of woman in what looks like a tight, cheap blonde wig instead of the airy, blousy colorless hair which was Lombard's trademark. Cate Blanchett does a fine job at emulating the Kate Hepburn voice but has none of her fine, angular facial features. The worst choice was Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, nowhere close. <br/><br/>The physical miscastings are topped by Leonardo DiCaprio who, God bless him, works his little heart out playing Hughes but selling us his Oogie Pringle, Walter Denton teen, nasal soprano voice for Hughes' baritone is challenging. This mismatch is compounded especially for those of us who can still recall the mature, handsome face of Howard Hughes and can contrast it with DiCaprio's still unlined Kewpie appearance. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most irritating part of this picture is in its distortion of Howard Hughes' years where we see, for example, his extreme and radical mental deterioration begin before his famous senate hearings of 1947 which was not the case. My own original and primary research with a long time friend who lived in Vegas and knew Hughes in his final years said to me emphatically that he was not the bizarre psycho with long fingernails and matted hair described in the media back then.<br/><br/>In summary, the film is devoid of meaning and strangely hollow. It is conversely not without some entertainment value. It has some marvelous performances in it, especially that of Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. However, as a biopic of Howard Hughes I can't recommend it"
"megakerl47","1","63","125","27 December 2004"," Scorsese lost it
","I am a genuine lover of films. I write this not to be hateful but to give my honest opinion about a film that is getting hyped by critics but that left me and my friends baffled. Quite frankly, I can't remember a film I despised so much as THE AVIATOR, a beautifully photographed leaden piece of metal with no more heart than a piece of left over scrap metal from the Spruce Goose. Howard Hughes is an admittedly difficult subject matter for a film (perhaps this is why so many announced film projects about the eccentric billionaire have gone by the way side) -- Peculiar to a fault, Scorsese fails to make Hughes sympathetic or understandable to audiences he expect to go on a three hour journey into Hughes madness (which is pretty much the same in the third scene in the film as it is in the last.) DiCaprio does his best, but the character of Hughes has nowhere to go. So he's rich and eccentric and troubled. Why should we care if we can't sympathize or at least empathize? And we are really excepted to believe his life long phobias are the result of a single conversation with his creepy mother during a bath?<br/><br/>The lone bright spot in this film is Cate Blanchett who manages to turn in a richly textured performance of Katherine Hepburn. But her presence ain't worth the boredom you have to wade through the other 2 hours and 45 minutes she's not on film. This is a film critics seem to love, and I'm no critic. But I know when a film leaves me bolting for the exit at the end. <br/><br/>If the site of naked, half mad Howard Hughes lining up rows upon rows of milk bottles filled with urine is your idea of a good time, THE AVIATOR is the film for you."

Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation, Goodfellas, Casino, Bringing out the Dead and Gangs of New York--who would want to really be any of these guys? Even Jesus has issues.<br/><br/>In the Aviator, Scorsese has made a slicker, more Hollywood friendly film, and it will likely be rewarded with Oscars for his more accessible approach. But the themes still remain: a troubled misfit attempts to shape the world to meet his wants, but the world is not his opponent--once again, it is his demons.<br/><br/>There will be people who criticize this film because it's not as ""Scorseseque"" as most of his work, but come on, guys, not much has changed really. The editing and special effects might diminish the grittiness that permeates most of this great director's work, but Martin Scorsese is at his peak as a storyteller here; the film is three hours long but I didn't even know it until I looked at a clock after exiting the theatre. It feels like it plays in half that time--the movie is a very entertaining masterpiece about one of the most influential and complicated industrialists in American history; the man Howard Hughes was a true visionary, and dare I say in the world of aviation... apparently an artist. But like so many artists, this one is troubled, and DiCaprio plays him very, very well.<br/><br/>I still liked Gangs of New York better, but this is a great movie and if it nabs Scorsese the key Oscars he has never called his own (Best Picture, Best Director) then he can finally fulfill that tiny blank space on his resume. If not, who cares? Scorsese doesn't need an Oscar to prove he's the greatest of all American filmmakers."

De Caprio does some of his best work here, and both Beckinsdale and Hepburn are quite impressive. Still, near the end I wasn't sure what I had seen. It felt long and tedious in some parts. I was hoping it would get better. I never felt the passion and the fire in the man, never got to the point where I could relate to his victory or the joy he took in his work.

Every time he spoke I thought he was the drifter from Titanic trying unsuccessfully to imitate Howard Hughes, as well as Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>There are great performances from Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and Cate Blanchett as Kathrin Heppern.<br/><br/>However, my advice to No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stafani is to keep your day job, because you seriously need acting lessons. You make look like Jean Harlow, but you sure don't act like her in the least. Also, Kate Beckinsale looks strikingly close to Ava Gardner, but, she basically sleepwalks through her role.<br/><br/>Also, I don't think that Marty Scorsese was up to the task of directing the biography of Howard Hughes, I think that Michael Mann should have kept the project, as he is more suited to successfully direct compelling biographies.<br/><br/>I think that Michael Mann and Marty Scorsese should have traded projects this year, with Mann directing The Aviator and Scorsese directing Collateral. I think the results would have been much better.<br/><br/>All in all, not a total disaster, but far from the best film of the year.<br/><br/>Two stars out of four, not worthy of a best picture award in the least.<br/><br/>Far from Scorsese's best work."

","This film was apparently made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The most noticeable fault is that much of it is untrue. The movie takes place mostly in the 1940's when Hughes was at the peak of his career. There is very little about his life after that period.<br/><br/>Although much of his private life was personal and not known to the public, this did not stop the film makers from inventing things they didn't know about him. Although there is no reason to think there was anything psychologically wrong with him at that time, the movie makers made him appear as some kind of nut who mumbled to himself and behaved in crazy ways, something that is unsubstantiated and offensive since he was the head of large corporations and did (his company still does) a lot of business with the government, unlikely for a crazy person as he is depicted in this film.<br/><br/>The producers (which include Leonard DiCaprio) apparently took what few bits and pieces of his personal life are known to the public, rearranged them to suit this mostly fictional film, and came up with another trashy Hollywood film.<br/><br/>The acting left much to be desired as well."

"Danusha_Goska","5","37","72","26 December 2004"," Flawed Narrative; Flawed Take on Mental Illness; Great Cate as Kate
","Martin Scorcese's ""The Aviator"" is a long movie -- 169 minutes.<br/><br/>A movie that long has got to have a narrative that drives the film from first frame to last, if for no other reason, than to keep viewers from becoming bored.<br/><br/>Will Scarlett get together with Ashley or Rhett, for example? ""The Aviator"" lacks that narrative drive. There's no one story that propels the film from first frame to last. What there is is a series of episodes, some interesting, some less so. About two thirds of the way through, the film does get boring. You just want it to finish up.<br/><br/>Before that point, there's a lot happening on screen to keep your interest.<br/><br/>There's a lot of money on view here. Hughes' film ""Hell's Angels"" is recreated. You get to watch World-War-I era biplanes swoop and fight in the sky. You watch Hughes crash land a plane. This scene will no doubt bring to mind 9-11, as it depicts a plane crashing into inhabited buildings.<br/><br/>Best of all, you have Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. This is one of the most extraordinary performances ever seen on film. Stars are stars because they are unique and fabulous; actors playing dead stars usually waste their time -- you can't imitate their charisma and fabulousness; uniqueness is, by definition, inimitable.<br/><br/>Blanchett incinerates any doubt you may have had about her ability to pull off Kate Hepburn. Looking nothing like Hepburn, she conjures everything anyone ever loved or hated about her -- the attitude, the voice, the accent.<br/><br/>Brava, Cate. She all but renders Kate gratuitous.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale and Gwen Stefani, as Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow, respectively, can't touch Cate's performance. Luckily, they are on screen for less time.<br/><br/>There's a great scene, too, where Howard is dissed at a dinner party by Kate's obnoxious, limousine liberal, Connecticut family. The best such scene I've ever seen, as good as Susan Sarandon's ""I am working class"" from ""White Palace."" But Cate's performance, and that dinner party, take place in a void. There's no long-line narrative into which they fit, working to bring the movie to a powerful climax.<br/><br/>To the extent that the movie does have a long line narrative, it is a narrative so grim and unappealing that most viewers, if they knew that that's what they were buying a ticket to see, might pass.<br/><br/>The real Howard Hughes was famous for dying an ignominious death, made ugly by his untreated mental illness.<br/><br/>Throughout ""The Aviator,"" there are scenes hinting at Hughes' eventual complete mental breakdown.<br/><br/>For example, Hughes and Hepburn dine out. Erroll Flynn, wonderfully played by Jude Law, visits their table and upsets Hughes' carefully arranged dinner plate. Once Hughes' peas are rearranged, he can't eat. He leaves the restaurant in a panic.<br/><br/>The background of this scene is very lush. Law is as good as Erroll Flynn as Flynn himself. What you are left with, though, is that very creepy, disturbing image of a grown man who is so deviled by undiagnosed, untreated mental illness that he can't finish a meal if one of his peas is moved.<br/><br/>Creepy. Sad. No Exit.<br/><br/>The most the movie comments on this tragedy is to suggest that Hughes' mother made him crazy. This is shameful. For years mothers were blamed for making their children schizophrenic or autistic. These outdated, misogynist ideas wounded innocent people and did not help the mentally ill at all. What was Scorcese thinking? Was he thinking? Scorcese's inability to deal, intelligently, with the theme of mental illness reflects his inability to bring the viewer close to Howard Hughes. I never felt, while watching this big budget, splashy, technically impressive movie, that I was learning a single thing about Howard Hughes. I never felt that I was being brought into his mind, heart, drive, life.<br/><br/>I don't know if this was the fault of the script, or DiCaprio's performance, or Scorcese's direction.<br/><br/>I left this lengthy movie, though, without new insight into Howard Hughes."

He does NOT possess the physical intensity that Hughes had, not to mention almost being the physical opposite. It'd be like Steve Martin playing James Dean. It's just WRONG. 2. For all the accolades Blanchett gets as Hepburn, she's somewhat of a caricature. Her accent was too over the top. What, did Scorcese think we wouldn't know who she was supposed to be? 3.I think an unknown as Hughes would have been a better idea, but then it might not have gotten the big box office receipts we're hearing about.

All were drawn in by the glow of Oscar nominations, wondering whether any film could compete with Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King sweeping the boards last year. During the film, nearly twenty of the people in my group went out half-way through and never came back to watch the rest of the film. Seven people admitted to falling asleep. After the film had finished, only two people said they liked it and even they would give it only 6/10. I personally lost the will to live. Leonardo DiCaprio, who shined in Romeo + Juliet, was irritating and uninteresting. I even found myself growing annoyed with Cate Blanchette, who is a wonderful actress, because of the fact she was in this film. The story advanced slowly and tediously. I didn't really care about the characters as they had little depth to them. Huges obsessive compulsive disorder was never really explained and there was no humour to balance out his repetitive breakdowns. Had the film been created with some black comedy and some in-depth character explorations then this may have been able to do what all films should - entertain.

","Overly long, boring, badly acted and directed. Shocking how badly Martin Scorcese has fallen off, after triumphs such as Goodfellas not that many years ago. Leonardo DiCaprio is incapable of playing grown-up roles, as he continues to look like an overgrown infant even as he pushes thirty-something. I'm amazed at the gushing over Cate Blanchett's grotesque imitation of Katharine Hepburn- Frank Gorshin does a better one. And don't even get me started on Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, who was apparently a sexless, anorexic coat-hanger instead of a bombshell (much to my surprise). However, the greatest disappointment by far was Scorcese, who completely lost any semblance of a storyteller in favor of cheesy CGI effects and bogus dialog. Too bad, because Howard Hughes was a truly fascinating subject- a deeply neurotic multimillionaire, plagued by obsessive-compulsive disorder, but also a true visionary and aviation pioneer. This movie doesn't do him justice."

","Some people say you can't be born a legend, you can only become one. Well, I think in the case of Martin Scorsese, it's a little bit of both. You see, when you're watching a Scorsese film, you're watching movie-making at its best. No detail is left behind in his films which is just one of the many reasons why Scorsese is one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. Over the years Scorsese has put out some masterpieces and although he has won numerous awards for his work, he has yet to hold the coveted Oscar statuette in his hand. A couple years ago when GANGS OF NEW YORK was being promoted, everyone thought it would be the one to give Scorsese his first Oscar, but as most of us saw, that didn't happen. Instead we saw the much acclaimed musical CHICAGO take home the gold. Two years later, we find Martin Scorsese to be in the same exact position, only it's with THE AVIATOR now. Will the same fate hit Scorsese again with Adrew Lloyd Webber's THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, yet another musical? Or will the academy finally award him for not just his magnificent work on THE AVIATOR, but for everything he has brought to movies over the past 30 years? <br/><br/>This film is loosely based on the life of Howard Hughes, one of the first true millionaires of America. Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), who was only a teenager when he inherited his family's tool business, had dreams that most of us couldn't even begin to think of. One of his dreams was to make a motion picture, which he did with HELL'S ANGELS, a film that not only introduced Hughes to Hollywood, but introduced him to such movie starlets as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). Having always had a love of aviation, Hughes decided to build the world's fastest plane during the making of HELL's ANGELS, a project that proved to be successful one clear day in 1935. After being dubbed the ""world's fastest man,"" Hughes decided to broaden his spectrum of wealth by purchasing the airline company TWA (TransWorld Airlines). He even began to build a special spy plane for the government, but all was not well in Hughes mind as time passed by. After being dumped by Hepburn, a new enemy arrived for Hughes, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), president and CEO of America's leading airline PanAm. And Trippe, with politicians on his side, set out to destroy not only TWA, but Hughes himself leading the great aviator to fight mental demons he never thought he would have; demons that would eventually leave the pioneer at rock bottom. But, just when you think Hughes has no fight left in him, he picks himself back up and somehow manages to rise to the top again in a fashion that could only be expected from Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Ever since GANGS OF NEW YORK, I had the feeling that we would see Scorsese and DiCaprio team up again, but who would have guessed it would be DiCaprio coming to Scorsese instead of the other way around? As it turns out, DiCaprio is a huge Howard Hughes fan, so when he gave the idea to Scorsese, how could the great director refuse? Well, I'm confident that Scorsese sees something in young Leo, which is probably why he agreed to direct the film. Scorsese allows his young actor to pretty much open up his talents, which couldn't have been a better decision. Going back to WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, I could see the endless potential DiCaprio, but I would never expected such a performance like the one he turned in for THE AVIATOR. He truly became Howard Hughes inside and out balancing the true nature of what made Hughes a legendary industrialist and pioneer. But, DiCaprio was not the only star in this film; he had some great talent around him led by Cate Blanchett, who just seems to get better with time. Blanchett, who played Katherine Hepburn, captured the true essence of why Hepburn was a marvel in Hollywood. And then there was Kate Beckinsale, who did a tremendous job in playing Ava Gardner, the new and upcoming star of the times. Beckinsale, who most people will remember from PEARL HARBOR, in my mind, is starting to come into her own as an actress. Only time will tell us how great she actually becomes. But, the one guy that many will forget from this film will be Alec Baldwin, who played the evil PanAm CEO Trippe. Even though Baldwin doesn't occupy much of the films 168 minute running time, his presence is known in every scene in which he appears, reaffirming his talent as being the best among his brothers.<br/><br/>Many critics will downplay this film because it drags and it's too long. And, although I do agree that the film felt longer than it was, that's one of the aspects that I come to appreciate with a Martin Scorsese film. I mean, going in I know it will feel like a 6-hour film, but I don't care. In fact, I look forward to it because there's no other director in Hollywood that can do the things that Scorsese does behind the camera, and no other director that can bring in the type of emotion that Marty can bring. He may spend more time on scenes, but every detail is played out which ultimately makes his films complete. And in THE AVIATOR, Scorsese has clearly done just that bringing in all the emotion and features that made Howard Hughes who he was.<br/><br/>I don't know what the future holds for THE AVIATOR, but if my predictions are right, it will be covered in gold. Not only did Martin Scorsese capture the true essence of Howard Hughes and what he meant to this country, he allowed Leonardo DiCaprio to run with the character which ultimately left no stone unturned."

","Since this got a lot of award nominations, I thought it would be better. It was OK, but too long. There is so much to tell about Howard Hughes; you can't do it in one film. And this movie stops when he was still fairly young. We don't see him in his later years when he was really nuts.<br/><br/>The lesson to this movie, if you let unstable people have a bunch of money, then they are going to do some crazy things. Hughes throws money around to build his dream planes and to make movies that aren't very good. According to this movie, his biggest enemy was Pan-Am, who was trying to keep TWA from flying overseas.<br/><br/>Also, the movie shows a lot of his girlfriends, many of whom were famous actresses. It never dwells to deep into his personal relationships though. I'm sure there were many more interesting things about them.<br/><br/>FINAL VEDICT: It was OK, not great. And we learn Hughes sure loved his bar of soap. If you're into biographies then you'd probably like it; otherwise, I would skip it. Also Leo is sort of hot in this, but they have to make him look crazy in some parts. So, it isn't the best film to Leo watch."

","I didn't think it was possible, but Martin Scorsese has made a boring film -- a great big, gorgeously shot, beautifully art-directed bore, but a bore just the same. Howard Hughes and his involvement with advancements in aircraft technology and the Hollywood of the 30s and 40s ought to be a no-brainer. The fault is in the casting of Leo DiCaprio. He's a callow pipsqueak, who, while gifted as a child actor, has not made a satisfying transition to adult roles. Since ""The Aviator"" hinges on the personal magnetism of an obsessive and ultimately unhinged pioneer, this is a fatal flaw. First, there's the voice -- a crucial instrument for an actor -- and DiCaprio's nasal whine is rather sad. The depthless blue eyes don't help. Then there's the boobie face, with nary a character line (one furrow between his sculpted eyebrows doesn't count, although he works it with all his might). His petulant, furtive body language is like something displayed by a troubled teen in an after school movie. He does make an earnest try, thrashing around in naked desperation in a couple of scenes, and miming all the mannerisms of a soul afflicted with OCD, but it's all affectation. He's not much of an actor, and he's not a leading man. <br/><br/>The audience with which I watched a preview gasped with delight when Kate Blanchett popped into the picture as a brutally bubbly Kate Hepburn, all swagger and need. She captured the actress and woman without turning her into a caricature -- no mean feat. The scene at her family's dinner table is a revealing look at the privileged Yankee eccentrics who shaped her.<br/><br/>Once again, Alec Baldwin turns in a convincing performance as a high-powered bad guy, in this case the head of Pan Am, with Alan Alda, cast against type, as his unctuous henchman in Congress. John C. Reilly has nothing to do except wear fedoras, and and in her amazing jewel-toned wardrobe and jewelry, Kate Beckinsale is quite fetching as Ava Gardner. She's no Ava Gardner but that's not her fault -- nobody is.<br/><br/>A handful of riveting action scenes pick up the pace of the story, especially a crash landing in Beverly Hills which nearly killed Hughes, then it's back to Leo, and the movie flags. I wanted to like ""The Aviator"", and I just didn't. I'm blaming DiCaprio."

","Suppose Martin Scorsese made a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt which consisted of three hours of discussion of his affair with Lucy Mercer and his Polio induced disability with only slight attention paid to the Great Depression or WWII. Better yet, suppose the movie ended just after FDR's third inauguration with a Republican foe, played by Alec Baldwin, rising and in two or three sentences, acknowledging defeat and predicting that FDR would end the depression and rid Europe of Nazism and Fascism, making it safe for Socialism.<br/><br/>Substitute Howard Hughes for FDR and change paralysis to OCD and you have, ""The Aviator."" Scorsese's thesis is that everything Hughes did was the result of an obsession or compulsion. Hughes compulsively chases (and catches) every beautiful Hollywood actress in the 1930's and 40's. Meanwhile, his obsession with airplanes and perfection drives him to design innovative aircraft that enable him to be the first man to circumnavigate the globe in four days and set new air speed records. We are shown a seemingly endless scene (one of many) in which he is trapped in a men's room because he is so obsessed with germs that he is afraid to touch the doorknob. Strangely, this fear of germs doesn't seem to prevent him from touching the private parts of female movie stars. (It should be noted that Hughes's biographers rarely if ever mention his disorder as occurring prior to the late 1950's.) As if in answer to my most fervent prayers, the movie finally concludes in a 1947 scene (after Hughes has defeated the U. S. Senate and several couples have left the theater, but before he has established his business empire) by having Alec Baldwin, as the head of Pan Am, predict Hughes's accomplishments in the 50's and 60's (which should have been shown in scenes replacing those of catch me, catch me with starlets and Hughes suffering from the OCD he had not yet acquired).<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett, currently the best actress in Hollywood, is outstanding as Kate Hepburne. Leo DeCaprio is not credible as a giant like Howard Hughes. He isn't helped by having to spend the duration of the movie displaying a facial expression which seems to say, ""I have to find a men's room, fast."" For this atrocity, Scorsese should be exiled to movie hell in Northern Minnesota making movies about female iron workers filing sexual harassment law suits."

","Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors of his generation. Martin Scorsese is the greatest director of all time. They have made a formidable pair over the years and sometimes I think DiCaprio is miscast for certain roles (""Gangs of New York,"" ""The Departed""), but ""The Aviator"" has DiCaprio's name all over it. This is one of the best, if not thee best, acting performances I have seen since Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull."" Both characters have their similarities as well. Jake La Motta had his own inner demons which lead to his paranoia about his wife which ultimately lead to the destruction of the people around him and Howard Hughes' demons are brought front and center as we see where it all starts when he's given a bath at an age where the young Howard should be more than capable to cleaning himself. His mother tells him about all the diseases and makes him spell the word ""quarantine."" In this unsettling opening scene we see where his delusions start. <br/><br/>DiCaprio can be hilarious at times and heartbreaking at others. Scorsese and DiCaprio do an incredible job of taking us from the marvel of his genius and innovation in aviation to the destruction of his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). It starts off slow with a few hints here and there that something isn't quite right with Howard Hughes, but gradually we see more and more and more and more and more until we finally see some horrifying acts from Hughes as he locks himself in his projection room playing reels of his films ""The Outlaw"" and ""Hell's Angels"" over and over and over and over again. These films have been completed and released, but Hughes is still watching. Still looking for these imperfections. He's stuck. He's stuck in his mind and he's stuck in his life and he's stuck in his projection room.<br/><br/>There are some very good scenes with Cate Blanchett, who plays Katharine Hepburn, and quite wonderfully I might add, and by wonderfully I mean terribly annoying, loud, and excessive. The damn woman does not shut up. Howard says, ""I could always hear you."" She replies, ""That's 'cause I'm so Goddamn loud."" Yes you are miss Hepburn, yes you are. They have some great scenes together, but the best one comes when Howard meets her entire family and it's quite possibly the greatest dinner sequence I have ever seen. It's beautifully shot as we watch Howard Hughes struggle to keep up with all the conversations going on at the same time due to his deafness. They are extremely rude people and they bully him and then he finally snaps and we feel so good for him. Katherine Hepburn is a completely different person with her family than alone with Howard. Howard accuses her of acting in her real life and wonders if she even knows anymore. This leads to the destruction of their relationship and leads to more paranoia from Howard Hughes as he burns all the cloths that she had infected. He calls Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to tell him to buy him some cloths and then quickly changes the conversation and starts asking him about recorders and asks if he's recording his conversation. This is where Howard Hughes and his paranoia starts to take off.<br/><br/>The best part of the film comes in the third act, during a simple and what some may think as a rather uneventful Congressional Hearing. It's two people cross examining each other, what could be so great about that? You would have to see to understand it. Alan Alda is the villain as Senator, Ralph Brewster, who is trying to pass a CAB Bill through the Senate that will put a monopoly on the air ways giving Pan Am sole possession of the sky. Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) had his people create the bill on their behalf to shut out the competition from Hughes' growing airway company- Trans World America- which is expanding across the Atlantic Ocean into Europe. Brewster and Trippe team up to investigate Hughes as they try to embarrass him in public by revealing all his secrets. They order the FBI to raid Hughes' house over and over again causing Howard Hughes to shut himself off from outsiders like nothing you have ever seen before. They threaten to take Hughes down by investigating what he did with the 50 million he received from the government to build plans that ultimately didn't fly during the war. Howard Hughes can simply sell over Trans World America to Juan Trippe and everything will be forgotten to hide him of the public embarrassment. Alda is spectacular and so crafty, always looking for a way to the top, or always getting his way with a smile on his face, just rubbing his arrogance in the face of everybody. During the Congressional Hearings the film reaches it's climax. This is where Hughes tries to overcome his extremely paranoid state and go to these Congressional Hearings and fight for his reputation. The battle that ensues between Alda and DiCaprio is incredible to watch. The final sequences brings us triumph. Only then are we brought right back down as we see Howard Hughes has not progressed in the final scene. It's a brutal ending it the subtlest of ways. The fact that we seen him at the Congressional Hearings gave us hope that he can somehow recover from his paranoid state; that he conquered his fear. Then, we are shot right back down with the final moments of the film capping off an incredible roller-coaster ride of emotions. The final act of the film is what I thought would undoubtedly give Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar, but to my surprise that didn't happen and that's a shame because he is absolutely incredible here. A fan of his or not, you can't deny his greatness in ""The Aviator."" <br/><br/>One of Scorsese' best.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Lysandra_Yaxley","Null","31","61","17 January 2005"," The Aviator - Fiction as history
","What amazes me most about the film is how historically inaccurate it is. The purported Hepburn/Hughes relationship is the worst. This is what really happened.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn met originally in late summer 1935 while she was making Sylvia Scarlett. She didn't care for him and was also involved with her agent, Leland Hayward. KH didn't see Hughes again for over a year.So the scene of him picking her up on the Sylvia Scarlett location to go golfing is incorrect.<br/><br/>In November, 1936, Hepburn broke up with Hayward. Hughes, as he frequently did when pursuing a woman, renewed his effort to get to know Hepburn knowing that she was on the rebound from a failed relationship. This time he succeeded and they began an affair in January, 1937 while she was on tour in a play.<br/><br/>After the play ended in May, 1937 she moved into Howard's house in Los Angeles. Hepburn and Hughes lived in his house for one year, from May 1937 to June 1938. By then her career had taken a dive and she lost her contract with RKO. She decided to go back east to do a play. She moved out of Hughes' house.<br/><br/>In her autobiography, Me, Stories of My Life, she said that the romance really ended at the time of the September 1938 hurricane which destroyed her family's summer home at Fenwick, Connecticut. She wrote: ""The next day God sent the hurricane of 1938. The house at Fenwick disappeared. Howard had a pilot fly in with water - - and I knew that Howard and I had become friends and not lovers. Love had turned to water. Pure water. But water."" As can be seen, their affair lasted a little less than two years, from January 1937 to September 1938. The film has the relationship lasting from 1935 to 1941 which is completely incorrect.<br/><br/>Three years after she broke up with Hughes, Kate met Spencer Tracy. This was in August, 1941. Tracy and Hepburn commenced a relationship that lasted 26 years until his death in 1967. Kate beginning a relationship with Tracy had nothing to do with her break up with Hughes which had happened three years prior. Since the two events were totally unrelated, there would have been no scene where Hughes was upset about Hepburn telling him that she and Tracy were involved and no break up with Hughes because she had met Tracy. <br/><br/>Hughes never bribed a tabloid editor to keep 'compromising' pictures of Tracy and Hepburn out of the tabloids. To begin with there were no tabloids to speak of in the 1940s. That was a phenomenon of the 1950s. Second, there were never any compromising photos of T&H. Third, if there had been compromising photos of them, their studio, MGM, would have dealt with the issue. They never needed Hughes for that purpose. MGM had a hell of a lot more clout with the press than Hughes would ever have had. In fact, every mention of Tracy in the film is completely fiction. There's no reason to have him in the film at all since he had nothing to do with Howard Hughes or the Hepburn/Hughes relationship.<br/><br/>The film has a scene where KH goes to a film premiere with Hughes. The date isn't clear but I guess it's 1939? Ava Gardner shows up at the premiere as well even though she wasn't in Hollywood. As has been previously noted, KH and Hughes broke up in 1938. It's ludicrous to show a scene with KH at a premiere with Hughes in 1939. She wasn't seeing Hughes at all much less going to social events with him. The other point, of course, is that Hepburn never went to premieres, not even the premieres of her own films nor to nightclubs. She was also known for not wearing dresses. The idea that she was prancing off to nightclubs and movie premieres in dresses is just plain silly.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes did not lock himself in a screening room for several days (or weeks) during the time frame that The Aviator covers. That episode occurred in 1957. And, of course, in any event Hepburn would have not been trying to coax Hughes out of the screening room since she wasn't involved with him in either 1947 or 1957. This scene is completely fictional.<br/><br/>Hepburn's father was a distinguished urologist and surgeon who was the head of the urology department at Hartford Hospital. Hepburn's mother was a well known advocate of women's rights including the right to vote in the 1910s and 20s and later the right of women to use birth control. They were not independently wealthy. Dr. Hepburn worked for his money. They didn't live in a palatial mansion. They were not snobs and they certainly didn't look down on Hughes. KH said in her autobiography that ""my family was not too sympathetic to Howard. In the first place, he was everlastingly on the telephone. And the telephone was in the dining room. Long telephone conversations did not suit the atmosphere. . . ."" While, it's true they didn't get along with him it wasn't because they thought he was beneath them. So this whole scene is false as well as being incredibly insulting to the Hepburn family. <br/><br/>There are many other errors but the 1000 word limit keeps me from describing them all. <br/><br/>It's quite obvious that the film makers decided to portray Hepburn in the film because she's still well remembered. She, in fact, was only briefly involved with Hughes and he was involved with many, many women. If the film makers wanted to be accurate they would have included Billie Dove and Jean Peters but then, no one remembers them so they invented a grand passion between Hughes and Hepburn which simply never happened."

","The master of the small movie apparently wants to be the master of the epic film. Unfortunately this is a tall order for anyone, especially for someone who hasn't made a particularly good film (small or epic) since 1990. But at least this time he is trying for a masterpiece and not just pissing away his time with garbage. There will be inevitable comparisons with ""Citizen Kane"" (in fact at one point in the film a reference is even made to W.R. Hearst) but anyone who does so should get a reality check. A more appropriate side-by-side comparison would be Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", and this is a comparison that ""Aviator"" loses.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that ""Aviator"" is a bad movie, although certainly it is bad history and is in need of major trimming, it is at least entertaining to watch. One wonders, however, if it will fare well enough at the box office to justify its epic expense. It has a relatively small initial target audience and nothing about the final cut makes one think it will generate word-of-mouth appeal from the wider population.<br/><br/>There are a number of flying scenes and two are very good, the night landing on a golf course and the take-off of the Spruce Goose. There are also two that are very weak. The worst is the setting of a new speed record which has a serious continuity error, the plane on the runway was clearly not the plane in the error (bad pun intended). This was so obvious (one had a partial canopy and one had a full canopy) and they cut back and forth so much that I wondered if I was hallucinating the disparity-hard to believe that it was not handled better. The other was the crash of the spy plane in a Hollywood neighborhood. The cartoonish shots of various homeowners watching their houses being destroyed from the inside would fit a Cohn Brothers comedy but are totally out of place in this film.<br/><br/>The film has one great performance, Cate Blanchette channels the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Katherine Hepburn, her scenes are the highlights of the film and fortunately she has a lot of scenes. It took a lot of courage for Scorsese to not just structure the film around someone as familiar as Hepburn but to have her character played in a manner where she was recognizable to her fans.<br/><br/>Alan Alda does great as a slimy senator, Adam Baldwin is slick as thestrangely likable Pan Am President, Kelli Garner and the other Kate (Beckinsale) are dazzling decoration, and Ian Holm provides comic relief. Apparently Scorsese felt he needed this high caliber ensemble to compensate for miscasting the lead.<br/><br/>And miscast he is; from DiCaprio's first line you know that this will be a painful experience; although perhaps not quite as horrible as you would expect from his prior work. Since Scorsese's break with De Niro after Cape Fear, both director and actor have suffered. You have to believe that the replacement DiCaprio takes direction well and that Scorsese is gambling that he can hit a home run with a weak actor and not have to share the credit for his triumph. But his strategy does not work as their screen version of Hughes utterly fails to capture any of the personal magnetism of their subject. I left the theatre thinking how well Titanic Leo executed the role, for his attempt was clearly earnest; but that almost any real actor could have brought nuances to the part well beyond the scope of DiCaprio's abilities-even under Scorsese's direction. The weakness of his portrayal is not as obvious when he is the only one in a scene but it takes on varying degrees of glaring when he is paired with one of the better members of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>I kept coming back to Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood and wishing it was he who was playing Hughes. In real life Wood was a strange guy but almost one-dimensional when compared to Hughes. But if your only exposure to them was these movie biographies you would think that Wood was far more intriguing."

","Hello everybody, my name is an Average Movie Fan and I am here to offer you something that could save you, maybe not life, but at least an evening, to say nothing of ten bucks or whatever you'd leave at the box. I'm giving you my most sincere advice - forget 'Aviator', just stay at home, meet friends or take your date someplace else.<br/><br/>I have seen lots of movies, good ones, poor, bad, as-bad-as-it-gets, or even so-bad-that-even-good. I have seen movies that made me think, laugh, cry, or sometimes yawn. I have seen movies that I could view lots of times, that I saw once and that's enough, or movies that I felt had to pull out of the theatre to save at least my time, money being spent. But I have never seen something like 'The Aviator' being shown as a movie, for money, in a cinema.<br/><br/>You have read other comments, so you might have a general idea what this movie is. For me, the worst is not that the film is poor, plot is knotty (... wait a second, is there really ANY plot?), actors except for Blanchett and Law are much unappealing, screenplay reminds of an encyclopaedia, a biography and a playwright's handbook for beginners thrown into a blender. It's not that it's much too lengthy, dull, boring, bland and tame. It's all that I CAN SEE NO REASON NOR IDEA BEHIND THAT FILM.<br/><br/>People make movies for various reasons (ok, cash and/or fame, but that's everyone's material goal, so let's skip it). In every possible way, 'Aviator' fails. Each and every one.<br/><br/>Was it to entertain? I yawned at the 'how to live with OCD' part, my wife at the 'airline tycoon' one. And we both were equally bored at the romance parts, especially dialogs. Dialogs' bad, very bad dialogs.<br/><br/>Was it to honor Hughes? To present story of his - AFAIK quite fascinating - life? Failure and collapse - know no more, than I did before.<br/><br/>The 'can live with OCD' part is equally exaggerated in picture and poor as apart of HH image. And thank you, I saw Jack Nicholson as a man with OCD. Leo is just a journeyman.<br/><br/>Sincerely, I spent already twenty minutes typing this comment, and still have no idea, what keeps me doing so. If it's that bad, should just forget this. But there's something irritating me in this movie to unbelievable extent. It's like using a microscope to hammer nails. It's like buying a corvette and never driving it. It's like giving answer when the question has not been asked yet. It's like carving a poem on a grain of rice, or like world championships in ""Minesweeper"" game.<br/><br/>This movie is just for nothing, about nothing, will give you nothing. It just shouldn't have happen.<br/><br/>The only reason I can see could be only an error in the matrix."
"kedunlap","1","24","46","16 February 2005"," Sort of like watching a turtle on its back
","Knowing quite a bit about Howard Hughes, I expected to see a movie chronicling his minimal exploits in movie-making and his greater exploits as an aviator and a capitalist who built an airline and an aircraft corporation, took on a senate investigating committee and won, and, oh yes, bedded the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. (NOTE: I was amazed to see that in casting this movie they could find no actresses who could do justice to the beauty of Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, or even Faith Domergue. That may sound shallow, but beauty is what it was all about. I'll give a grudging pass to Cate Blanchett because of her superb acting. Besides, who ever had the regal beauty of Katherine Hepburne). Back to Hughes: the other interesting fact about Hughes is that at the end of his life he was destroyed by a mental illness we now refer to as obsessive/compulsive disorder. However, few of Hughes' biographers mention the OCD as a significant factor in Hughes' life prior to the late 1950's which is well beyond the time frame of this movie.<br/><br/>To my surprise, the movie was about little other than his OCD which, according to Scorsese, was the driving force behind almost everything Hughes did. I could have lived with that, except for the way it was presented. Poor Leo DeCaprio was forced to spend most of the movie looking as if he had just eaten something nasty. I guess that's what OCD does to you according to Scorsese. In painfully long scenes, DeCaprio would stand unable to function while the camera allowed us to stare at him. It was like watching a turtle on its back trying desperately to right itself.<br/><br/>People all over the theater were holding up their arms, apparently trying to check their watches as we passed the two-hour mark, and a few gave up and left early. Unfortunately, my curiosity overcame my discomfort and I stayed to the bitter end.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes was a much more interesting and complex man than this movie reveals, and his accomplishments were much greater than one would realize from the manner in which they are presented in ""The Aviator"".<br/><br/>Leo is not the right man for this role  he just isn't able to radiate the power, self-confidence, and even arrogance of Howard Hughes. Scorsese's Hughes comes off as a victim taking apparently stupid risks because of a mental affliction which in real life he had not yet acquired."

There is precious little of where HH got his money.He inherited a million on his 21st birthday .Nor is there ample explanation of how or what caused HH to disassociate from the world .His mother bathing him well past the age that it is necessary and her going on about germs and such hardly seems to be enough . It was said during HH's father's day ""Sure you can still drill for oil without a Hughes bit, as long as you don't mind using a pick and shovel "". HH's father was the real genius of the family having invented the rotary drill bit for oil exploration . By the way HH's Inheritance in todays dollars is the equivalent of ten million .Plenty for a young man to reinvent the world in his image . Much is made of HH's flying exploits but not much time is given to the 'Spruce Goose' that only managed to reach 70,feet of altitude and only flew for a mile ,hardly impressive stats .Yet Hughes was convinced this aircraft was the salvation the armed forces were looking for . Not much is said about HH's contacts with the CIA and his involvement in many shady deals perpetrated by that agency . Jude Laws cameo as Errol Flynn is alright I suppose as they are both effete in nature . As HH has very little connection to todays generation(movie buying public) this film will flounder and die in a relatively short time . Michael Mann was right to walk away from this project as there just isn't anything new or revealing to say about HH . The script is no revelation nor is the direction . 2 of 5 stars for the 'Aviator' And bye the way all these people debating'Aviator's' opening grosses are missing the fact that only half of the actual gross accrues to the studio the other 50/60% is eaten up by the theaters . So on that scale'Aviator' is without a doubt a bomb . It will be extremely lucky to gross thirty million domestically and will probably do the same over seas .

","He looks like a little boy trying to play the role of a grownup. Has there ever been a worse casting mistake? With his baby face looks, his high pitch voice, his phony Texas twang, and his forced mannerisms, DiCaprio not only is the wrong actor for the role, he is so distracting as to ruin the entire film.<br/><br/>That's the main problem. Another problem is the part of the plot that deals with the tedious technicalities of early aviation. I found it to be totally not interesting. Maybe it would be of interest to an aviation historian.<br/><br/>In addition, the film gushes with busy hubbub and lots of non-substantive chatter. The screenplay must have weighed a ton. Despite all the dialogue, the film's script lacks an emotional spine, making the film seem shallow, superficial, and insincere.<br/><br/>At a cost of over $100 million and a runtime of nearly three hours, the film conveys an air of superiority. It is very, very impressed with itself. It spews implied bravado. I cringe when I consider that the filmmakers could have made five very good films, costing $20 million each. Those are five films we will never see.<br/><br/>However, if you like DiCaprio, the Hollywood ""star"", you will no doubt like this film. After all, ""The Aviator"" is mostly just a flashy cinematic vehicle to enhance his star status. Viewers looking for an honest and in-depth study of the life of Howard Hughes will need to look elsewhere."

Contrary to what others have said though it is no where near the quality of Raging Bull or Casino et al.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's performance is excellent. His energetic depiction of the brilliant and often reckless Hughes is highly engaging. But it is perhaps in his portrayal of Hughes's hidden battle with mental illness that he most excels in this role.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchets performance as Hepburn whilst very likable seems to be somewhat over-acted, but nonetheless is very effective.<br/><br/>Notable mentions must go to Alan Alda as the corrupt Senator Brewster. This is by far his best screen work to date. Also Alec Baldwin turns in another noteworthy performance following 'the Cooler'.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsdales role seems almost unnecessary within this film. I not really sure what she was trying to do with her role. I not sure a poorly acted Marilyn Monroe is what Scorsese was looking for in Ava Gardner.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite an interesting journey to start with.

I think that one of the things that makes this a good biopic is that it made me want to learn more about the man. It was quite interesting to see how Hughes's obsessive nature was a double-edged sword, spurring him on while crippling him mentally.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance to date. The entire supporting cast is talented but DiCaprio is in another league altogether. Cate Blanchett also gives a stand-out performance, garnering a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Katherine Hepburn.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is impeccable, as expected, but the art department deserves special mention.

This movie may break the record for most GDs said in one major studio film with at least 50. Almost all were said by Leonardo DiCaprio, in the lead role as Howard Hughes. A minor disappointment was that the story ended about 1948. I wanted the see the old man Hughes walking around in Kleenex boxes, in his Las Vegas penthouse and perhaps learn more about the big controversy surrounding his will, a topic that was in the news for months yet I can't recall what the final verdict was.<br/><br/>GOOD NEWS - This was very interesting story, start-to-finish. The acting is superb, especially Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. Blanchett is just riveting in every scene she's in, and DiCaprio, for that matter, isn't far behind. My favorite scene in the film might be when Hughes tells off Hepburn's snotty, elitist parents. Great stuff there. No phase of Hughes' life is overemphasized from his flying, his womanizing, his illness, his business dealings and the politics against him. All are given an appropriate percentage of film time.<br/><br/>This is a very stylish film, a treat for the eyes courtesy a sharp DVD picture and wonderful camera-work.

","The Aviator is a flawless and powerful picture that leaves an impact on the viewer. The life of the late Howard Hughes is realized by director Martin Scorsese and his star, Leonardo DiCaprio, in this biopic that shows the millionaire's eccentric ventures into Hollywood film-making and breakthrough feats of aviation by breaking speed records. Before I saw this film, I had never really heard much about Howard Hughes so I wasn't really excited to see this film. However, he turned out to be quite an interesting man and this biopic did a good job of telling his life. He had many dreams and actually worked to try to complete them. He did some bad things and he also nearly died from a plane crash. I had never really had an interest for really old Hollywood but this film made me look up some things. Leonard DiCaprio did a great job portraying Howard Hughes. He would sometimes go over the top but rarely. Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn and does a pretty good job. I usually don't really like her but this movie is an exception. Kate Beckinsale also did a good job as Ava Gardner. John C. Reilly did a really good job though he wasn't a main character. He is also kind of underrated. Alec Baldwin isn't that great of an actor. I never really liked him but apparently Scorsese has a way to get the best out of everyone. Jude Law and Gwen Stefani aren't in the film very much, in fact I didn't really notice Gwen and Jude has like on scene. So very good acting from everyone. Martin Scorsese directs and I can't believe he didn't win an Oscar for this film. He made a beautiful picture and it was sometimes really moving as well. The running time is a long 168 minutes but it goes by so fast as I was defiantly hooked on the film. I find this film superior to Ray as it was better made. The characters were more interesting, direction was better and it didn't suffer from too many clichés. Jamie Foxx did a better job then Leo but not by much. This film also makes you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films more like this one. In the end, this is an expertly made film and defiantly worth checking out. Rating 10/10"

","I have to say I completely disagree with almost everything Yessdanc, for one, felt about this movie; I barely hesitate to say he/she seemed to want to find problems in the performances. I think Leonardo DiCaprio is great in general, but I honestly didn't expect to be as impressed by him (in this film) as the awards voters have been. However, his performance was absolutely fantastic. Howard Hughes was an amazingly complex individual, and DiCaprio made his every eccentric move plausible and real. He studied Hughes well and got amazing depth into his psyche. The accolades are deserved. As for Cate Blanchett seeming like a caricature, maybe -- but only in the sense that Katharine Hepburn herself was kind of like a caricature. Again, the performance was over-the-top only in a way that resembled Hepburn's constantly over-the-top personality. Many actresses would have to cower in shame trying to imitate the late, great Hepburn, but Blanchett did it naturally and without apology. Kudos to her as well. As for the film in general, it's wonderful. At 2 hours and some 40 minutes, it might lag for some, but the material is deep and true, while the acting and directing are heartfelt and energetic. It's a story well told, and it might even get you looking up a little history after the credits."

","When it comes to film, my love is primarily focused on two things. I can be swayed and amazed by brilliant metaphors and symbolisms and fantastic technical aspects, but a film is nothing to me without two key ingredients. First, I need power in the performances. Be it subtle inner pain or explosive intensity, it's practically impossible for me to love a film if it doesn't feature some great performances or at least a brilliant one in the lead. Secondly, and most importantly, is the story. The thing I love most about film is the ability it has to immerse me into a story and take me on a journey outside of my own world. Be it through wild comedic adventure, an action-filled extravaganza, a deep, emotional story about characters or a powerful epic drama, I have to love a story to love a film. Luckily for me, The Aviator features a magnificent story of a very complex individual and is anchored by one of the finest performances I've ever seen in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. While it does have flawless technical aspects (including a score that never ceases to amaze), the film is founded on these two elements. As you well know, Scorsese's film tells the story of the infamous Howard Hughes who led a life full of beautiful women and a huge amount of money to do whatever he pleased with. Hughes decided to put this money towards his huge ambition and his love for film and, more importantly, aviation.<br/><br/>As the film begins we see him working on his debut feature, Hell's Angels, which proudly portrayed his love for the sky and the planes that glide through it. Throughout the production he's met with an enormous amount of obstacles from money troubles to plane troubles to having to reshoot the entire picture because by the time it was finished, the era of silent films was over. We progress through the prominent stages of Howard's life and along the way, Scorsese shows us everything about his life from his relationships with beauties like Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) to his battles with severe mental issues ranging from OCD to bipolar disorder and potentially paranoid-schizophrenia; and all of this is portrayed exceptionally while in the background his aviation empire rises, falls and rises back again and his film career is met with constant turmoil. Scorsese manages everything perfectly so that the viewer is always aware of what's currently on screen, what's happening that we aren't seeing and what has driven the story up to the point we are currently at. It flows at a perfect pace, never going to quickly for the viewer to catch up and never dragging throughout it's almost three hour running time.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is perfect as he creates, in my opinion, what is easily his best film since Taxi Driver and one of the finest films of the decade. The film shares a lot of similarities to Scorsese's other widely acclaimed biopic, Raging Bull, and one of the key similarities is that the film is anchored by a wildly intense, unstoppable performance; in this case coming from Leonardo DiCaprio. Taking on someone as complex as Howard Hughes would be an immensely difficult task for any actor, especially one as young as DiCaprio, but Scorsese firmly believed in his abilities (the two previously worked together on Gangs of New York) and his decision pays off in a way that I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams. DiCaprio's power is stunning, his absorption into the character goes beyond anything one could have expected and he ultimately creates one of the finest performances I've ever seen. A raw, brutally intense portrayal that perfectly encompasses the legend that is Howard Hughes in a film that tells his story admirably and never cuts corners. Scorsese and DiCaprio both create what is bound to be one of the highlights of their careers and certainly is one of the highlights of this incredible decade of film."
"majic-5","10","7","11","11 November 2007"," Soars above other biopics
","In the past month, I've learned just how hard it is to make a great biographical film. Movies can suffer from an unremarkable subject (Bob Crane, in Auto Focus), not delve deeply enough into a subject's character (Ray, about Ray Charles), and not hit all the right emotional notes (Kinsey). The Aviator soars on all these aspects as it captures the most glorious slice of the life of Howard Hughes, the filmmaker, aviation innovator, and mentally unstable billionaire.<br/><br/>Granted, the movie has an easier time with its subject matter, because Hughes lived a flamboyant life. At age 21, he began filming Hollywood's then most expensive, Hell's Angels, and he was 25 and 4 million dollars poorer (that's 52 million in today's money) from his personal fortune before it was released, having assembled the world's largest private biplane feat, flying them to wherever he could find clouds to film (to increase the sense of the planes' speed), and re-shooting the movie from a silent film to a talkie. He produced a number of outlandish movies, including the original blood-spattering Scarface, and the provocative western The Outlaw, memorable mainly for its emphasis on Jane Russell's breasts. He wined, dined, and presumably bedded many leading ladies of the day, including Jean Harlow, Ava Gardner, and of course, Katherine Hepburn. <br/><br/>Where Hughes took his real risks, though, was in aviation. He was a brilliant technical innovator and a business visionary. Whether designing and flying test planes for the Air Force, building the first coast-to-coast airlines, or challenging a congressionally-proposed monopoly on international flight, Hughes did everything in a huge way. Both Leonardo DiCaprio, as Hughes, and Martin Scorsese, the director, capture the dashing and erratic Hughes with the same boldness as Hughes lived the first part of his life. <br/><br/>DiCaprio's intensity as a man driven by his obsessions drew me into the movie immediately. When he casually, but intently, calculates whether he can buy TWA to further his airplane dreams, I accepted that while the purchase might be a stretch, it was also a foregone conclusion. When he flies an experimental plane at 352 MPH, I was grinning as widely as Hughes. When he dates Katherine Hepburn (an outstanding performance by Cate Blanchette), there's no doubt that fiery ""Katie"" has met her match. And when he publicly confronts a corrupt senator intent on humiliating and bankrupting the billionaire, all you see is Howard Hughes spitting fire in a verbal fight for his life.<br/><br/>DiCaprio captures Hughes' growing mental illness just as well as his derring-do. Dicaprio spent some time with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder sufferers to study for the role, and it paid off  he captures the mannerisms perfectly, along with Hughes' horror at a disease that is engulfing him. When he began to obsess about cleanliness, I tensed, not wanting this great young man to begin the slide into insanity. Every time he washed his hands till they bled, recoiled at a speck of dirt on a suit, and opened a doorknob with a Kleenex, my jaw clenched as I silently urged him to pull out of the grip of his illness. The frustration and anguish Hughes experienced as went out of control and locked himself in his screening room to give his disorder full run twisted my stomach, aching for this classically tragic figure.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchette will get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her embodiment of Hepburn. At first, I giggled at the harsh reedy voice, distinctive speech cadence, and overbearing manner Blanchette presented (I giggled at Hepburn, too, when I saw her interviews). But pretty soon, especially as she and Hughes gelled as a couple, I believed Blanchette's performance completely, in her patrician act with her snobby Connecticut family, in her outrage at Hughes' frequent newspaper appearances with starlets, and especially in her tender scene where Hughes confesses his fear about his mental illness.<br/><br/>Scorsese is nearly flawless, too. From the co-written screenplay, to the pacing, to the CGI aerial scenes, and the nuanced performance he gets from all the major and supporting characters, this film is the equal of his other great efforts. While it's not as hard-edged as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, or Gangs of New York, it's a hell of a lot more fun. See this one in the theater, even if you have a big-screen TV. If you have one, see it again when the movie comes out on DVD and invite some friends."

ALL of the actors do a fantastic job especially Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn. The film however revolves around Howard Hughes and we see his highs and his lows.

While not as motivated as the rest of them, I am of the opinion that this is Scorsese's best picture since Raging Bull.... At 166 minutes it does drag at times, and the 3D rendered scenes stood out more than I would have hoped, but the over the top performances (In a good way) of Leonardo and Blanchett were nothing short of riveting. Didn't know Leonardo had it in him... I've had an avid interest in the work of Howard Hughes since I was very young... I've been inside the Spruce Goose, (It's presently in a museum in Northwest Oregon) so I went in expecting a lot...

","This was the longest, dumbest movie I've seen in years. There was no plot worth mentioning and whoever cast a very young 20 year old as the mature Howard Hughes without providing any aging makeup was an idiot. The entire cast (excepting Alan Alda) reminded me of little kids dressed up in their parents clothes playing 'adult' (badly). The 'special effects' were noteworthy for being totally unrealistic and the acting was non-existent in most cases. Alan Alda was the only adult in a featured role with all the rest of the older cast portrayed by a very youthful cast. This movie was made for teeny-boppers with a crush on DiCapprio, who should be limited to only those movies requiring a pretty face: preferably without any dialog required."

Specifically, his reflection on the mirror as he was trying to overcome his troubled emotions was executed thoroughly. It was very troubling and sad to see him trying to defeat all his naysayers while having to battle his emotions.

I just watched it again from one of the movie channels and I'm really blown away at how good it really was.<br/><br/>I know some here have mentioned Leonardo's portrayal of Howard Hughes OCD as being extremely good. I found it to be almost too god because as Howard Hughes slipped further into madness it became more and more uncomfortable to watch because it seemed to ring true. Without a doubt he captured the Howard Hughes we've seen from public clips, but also the Howard Hughes as reported by others. What a great study."

","The Aviator really is a fantastic film. The acting is so wonderfully done! I adored Cate Blanchett gives an impeccable portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. I mean everything from the voice and the behavior to her emotions. Very well deserved academy award victory! And of course Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job with his representation of the famed Aviator Howard Hughes. He is charming when the film calls for it, acts like a real old timey gentlemen, but then he can turn into a totally unhinged crazy person. And DiCaprio handles both kinds of demeanors very well. The script is very intelligently written and it gives such lengthy character development for both Hughes and Hepburn. I just adored the scenes that involved monologues by either Hughes or Hepburn, or scenes where it's them conversing back and forth. The acting is so involved and as I've mentioned, the script provides such deep character detail that when you combine those two things, it makes for an absolutely magical moment. And there are plenty of those kind of moments. The film handles the final stage in Hughes's life well, him going crazy, locking himself naked in a theater room. Long nails, long hair, completely naked, it would be an understatement to say he went ""mad"" towards the end of his life, and Leonardo plays this so well! Very realistic and it all flows naturally, doesn't seem forced in the slightest. Overall a fantastic film based on real people. 10/10!"

","Wow another amazing performance from Leo. I must say this film never interested me but I watched it on Netflix tonight and I thought it was great. Leonardo never ceases to amaze me. He plays the role of Howard Hughes who was a filmmaker then a aviator. Howard Hughes suffered from OCD and was known for his eccentric lifestyle. Leonardo did a great job of portraying him and the scenes where he is in a deep depression in his movie room were acted so well. I also loved the costumes which I think portrayed that time period perfectly. Especially Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner with the hair and hats, was spot on. I think this film was great and very enjoyable. It's sad to see the character of Howard Hughes declining but it is inspiring to see how much ambition he had. I really recommended this film, it is rather long but worth it."
"nimishasrivastava","10","2","2","2 November 2016"," Di Caprio's finest performance!
","I had never before heard of Howard Hughes, let alone be aware of his nature and his achievements. After watching this movie I thought I was watching Howard Hughes himself living, in all his eccentric, paranoid self and his love for aviation. Leonardo Di Caprio is my favourite actor, and after watching this movie in 2016, I cannot help but wonder, how can any performance surpass his depiction of Howard Hughes for the Oscars!! The movie was beautifully directed by the legend Martin Scorsese. Subtle details like the use of lights, flashes etc to highlight eccentric nature of the main character were phenomenal. For instance when Howard Hughes locks himself up in a room, my focus was on his fingernails which they showed to have grown several inches as he hadn't gotten out of that room. In all a must watch movie for everyone who wants to enjoy good film making."
"tsmith417","8","2","2","16 February 2015"," The story of a man who was a success at being a failure
","The first time I saw this film I thought, ""It's pretty good,"" but the second time I watched it I came away with a much different perspective.<br/><br/>Most of us knew about Howard Hughes' obsession with germs and about the Spruce Goose but not a lot about his early years or the extent of his involvement with airplanes. <br/><br/>""The Aviator"", but virtue of its very title, lets us know that flying was Hughes' magnificent obsession and everything else came second.<br/><br/>Watching the film the second time I was stuck by the importance of color. At first I thought something was wrong with the color on my television because when Hughes and Hepburn are playing golf the grass and leaves are a bright turquoise instead of green and the color of the sky looked odd too, yet the flesh tones were correct. Then it hit me that the color must have been ""correct"" too, according to something Scorcese wanted to imply. What that might have been I don't know but it got my attention and the colors kept my attention for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Vibrant decor and flashes of colors showed up throughout the film while the clothing and characters remained bland in comparison. People wearing brown jackets and slacks stood in rooms with bright green upholstered furniture or dark red walls, and the people seemed to fade into the background. Your attention was on their surroundings, not them, so that you concentrated on what they were saying instead of what they looked like.<br/><br/>But what do I mean by saying it's the story of a man who was a success at being a failure? Hughes, for all his billions in financial assets, never truly was a success at anything, according to this film. <br/><br/>Hughes' movies could never recoup their extravagant costs, he kept losing (or driving away) the women he loved, and even all his aviation dreams fizzled out when he lost contracts and ultimately a whole airline. He put too much of himself into everything he did, trying to achieve perfection, which only pushed him further and further away from it, and I came away from the film feeling sorry for Mr. Hughes. Whether that was Mr. Scorcese's intention, again, I don't know, but that was the message I got.<br/><br/>If you're looking for just another biopic where characters are explained to death and situations are always resolved, this isn't the film for you. But if you're willing to relax and let the images and characterizations take you over in a more subtle way, you're in for a treat."

","I do not understand why everyone hates this movie! This is one of Leonardo Dicaprios best performances. Cate Blanchet is also great as Katherine Hepburn. This film is so well directed and filmed by Martin Scorcese that it makes you feel like you are in the time period that the movie takes place in. This film has a very nostalgic feel to it. I especially liked how Martin Scorcese used music that matched the time period and filmed it using the color techniques that were used in the era this takes place in. It made the movie have a older feel to it like you were really in the time period. This is one of Martin Scorceses most underrated films. I especially loved the scenes that showed Howard Hughes directing movies because that sort of thing really interests me and it is cool to see how they did visual effects back in the 1920's. Any fan of martin Scorcese should watch this and anyone that is interested in Howard Hughes should watch this also. It does seem a little long and draggy in certain parts but it didn't bother me because i found this film so interesting. This is now one of my favorite films because it is beautifully directed and acted and it gives you an insight on early film making and on Howard Hughes and the people he associated with such as Ava Gardner and Katherine Hepburn.

It just did not appeal to me. But with all the hype, I decided to check this film out.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, this is about Howard Hughes, a successful billionaire who is great at having corporate trouble. This film talks about the new kind of films he made back in the 30's.

Leonardo DiCaprio is a really good job as he usually does. Cate Blanchett is really the must-see of the film. Her portrayal as Katherine Hepburn is a powerful one that even Hepburn herself would be knocked off her feet. I also like Alan Alda.<br/><br/>For a subject matter such as this, the film is way too long. This is no Lord of the Rings so I could not be engrossed in the film in several parts.<br/><br/>Scorsese does deserve some Oscar consideration(which it did).

A wonderfully stubborn and incredibly intelligent character knows what he wants and how to get it and wont sleep until the job is done right. Though he does have a moment of insanity he bounces back and shows his enemies what he's made of.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchette also did an excellent portrayal of a '30's actress: Katherine Hepburn.One might never have guessed that Cate Blanchette is an English actress who is not at all similar to that of Katherine Hepburn, but she did an excellent job. I would recommend this movie a million times over and fail to point out the few flaws the movie did have because one might not even see them behind the brilliance of the story and the beauty of the picture.<br/><br/>In the first few minutes of the movie I was hooked and was delighted that I have purchased the DVD so that I could watch it when I please.

","Howard Hughes was the notorious playboy of the 1930s and '40s who wooed every Hollywood starlet in sight and was responsible for delivering aircraft to the United States government at the cost of $56 million. He ran well over-budget and never delivered any planes, although his monstrosity ""The Hercules"" -- at the time, the largest aircraft in the world -- was eventually built and did, in fact, fly.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" chronicles Hughes' life -- from his childhood to the point at which he first became obsessive about germs, his hands and so on and so forth. Hughes became increasingly eccentric and insane as time went on and by the end of the film I think Scorsese does something rather brilliant in terms of narrative effect -- I won't give it away but suffice to say it's a nice little conclusion to the movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself is quite good but tries a bit too hard. The acting is top-notch and DiCaprio holds his own as Howard Hughes, proving once again he's more than just a pretty face. Cate Blanchett perfectly imitates Kate Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale is a great Ava Gardner.<br/><br/>However I feel some material could have been cut. Some scenes really held my interest and I momentarily was lost in the film -- then there were sequences throughout which I felt bored and wished it would move on.<br/><br/>Also, I found the subtitles (posted on the screen to introduce new characters, e.g. JOHN SMITH - FRIEND OF HOWARD HUGHES) a rather dubious element -- I expected better from Scorsese... introducing new characters with subtitles seems sloppy and far too easy for such a master filmmaker.<br/><br/>I also felt ""The Aviator"" lacked Scorsese's overall typically energetic visuals, opting more for a bloated epic style -- one gets the feeling Scorsese was in it for the Oscar this year and was out to prove to the Academy that he could make a typical epic. There are a few tracking shots but other than that, it really didn't feel like ""A Martin Scorsese Picture."" On the plus side I found the cinematography quite nice, the musical score entirely fitting, the cameos amusing (Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law amongst others), and most of the dialogue believable.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" is not Martin Scorsese's best film, nor would I call it the best film of 2004. It is not flawless, but it does manage to entertain for the most part and is a solid insight into the life of Hughes. If I had one complaint, I'd say about thirty minutes altogether could have been edited out and replaced with more interesting material (or none at all), but as it stands, ""The Aviator"" is a very good movie."
"nitratestock35","Null","2","2","4 February 2005"," great movie with an ""updated"" period feel
","Martin Scorsese is undoubtedly one of the great living masters of motion pictures. <br/><br/>The Aviator succeeds as a motion picture, not so much as a drama. I think this has to do with the changing of times. Persons looked, spoke and behaved totally different some 70 years ago. The actors all generally look too sweet, too gorgeous for the roles of real-life actors they portray (that is: when compared 1:1 with the originals). <br/><br/>When we look at the original actors on old movies or newsreels, they were much edgier, much louder and in a way even cruder. People in general clearly have become sweeter looking and more soft spoken. Even the most brilliant casting would not be able to produce a closer resemblance - and I cannot think of a better cast.<br/><br/>Of course Cate Blanchett stands out for her Kate Hapburn portrayal not only concerning the voice and behavior but also the hard part: beneath that skinny, bright, talented, tomboyish upper class chatterbox there was a gorgeous and lovable woman who does care. Remarkable (both the original Kate and Cate (destiny?) Blanchett !<br/><br/>On a technical level the movie fully succeeds. The computer generated effects fit seamlessly into the live action. The carefully controlled colors and film grain are an eyeful to behold. There is a lot of testosterone in this movie as well. Pure male pioneer spirit. The aircraft all look breathtaking - of course men can better understand why one would drool over the deafening sound of an old radial engine and why someone's heart would pound faster just by looking at all these classic precision crafted Mitchell movie cameras (I am still drooling). This definitely is a movie about (and for) boys and their toys. <br/><br/>I found it more than adequate that no attempt was made to ""explain"" Howard Hughes obsessive compulsive behavior. We are just presented with the drama of that mental disorder. Any ""explanation"" (I am still not over the ending of Hitchckock's Psycho) would have taken away from the mystery of the man.<br/><br/>The same goes for Huges' totally insane business decisions with his loyal personal employees doing the best to hold everything together. We don't know if Huges' was acting on instinct, impulse, knowledge, relying on luck, had a vision or something else. That's the whole point: no one knew. It is a surprise how articulate he appears opposite Alan Alda (brilliant as usual) during the public hearings. <br/><br/>Leo di Caprio gives a great portrait. Of course he looks more boyish and more handsome than the real Hughes, but we are living in the 2000s and our minds interpret persons in a different way now. In a way this movie updates the characters for the actual times we live in. <br/><br/>The women in this movie all look drop-dead gorgeous, not like their real life counterparts but most likely very much as they appeared to someone some 70 years ago. <br/><br/>One small observation: great English stage actor Ian Holm, still best remembered as Ash the robot from Ridlety Scott's Alien, is once again totally underused in a role as a sincere scientist. Please give that man some better roles in the near future. Nevertheless a nice touch.<br/><br/>Great movie - the three hours flew by. Literally."
"galbach14","9","2","2","30 January 2005"," Dicaprio is finally in his prime, Scorsese remains in his prime
","Even though Leonard Dicaprion still looks like a baby, Scorsese and his last two films have helped turn him into one of today's finest young actors. Dicaprio (30 years old, I believe) brings bright eyes and baby faced excitement to the young drill bit tycoon from Texas, Howard Hughes, trying to piece together his epic, grand scaled first film ""Hell's Angels."" Just when he's got it about wrapped up, he realizes that the public is no longer interested in silent films and wants to re-shoot his film for sound. Months and millions later he gets it done. This is just the opening act of Scorse's obligatory epic, and although this surely is not Marty's best picture or most personal piece, we can see a parallel character in Hughes to that of Scorsese. Like ""Gangs of New York,"" ""Kundun,"" ""The Age of Innocence,"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" Scorsese has created a world from the past that he had never seen with his own eyes but had vision enough to imagine it and imagination enough to direct his actors to exist in it. Dicaprio as his lead man in the last two Scorsese pictures is not his new Deniro but a young actor with cooperation enough to create these worlds and the dark (and light) side of human nature that exist within them. It is time this year that Scorsese is finally given his Academy Award for Achievement in direction. This film is not just an excuse to give him an award, but rather a showcase of one of America's finest filmmakers still very much in his prime."
"ZoSoJr182","7","11","20","30 December 2004"," Not Scorsese's Best, not even close.
","Though certainly not a bad film by any means, it still is only Scorsese's fourth best film (his best is Gangs of NY, then Goodfellas, then Casino). I do think Leo deserves a nomination because he displayed the character excellently, especially the OCD (which i would know what it is like, because i have it), but I still think Colin Farrel deserves the win. Also Cate deserves a nomination because i thought she was Hepburn, but i also think Angelina deserves the win. I don't how ever think that Scorsese deserves a nomination because the film had many flaws, all having to do with direction and the story that he chose to use, if you were to say he deserved the nomination for Gangs of NY i would agree, i thought he should have won for that, maybe even Goodfellas, but definitely not this one, i'll be fair and give my reasons. First of all why did he put so many long dialog sequences with no score in the movie that had nothing to do with character, it was all about money and politics, and really i couldn't give a crap and a half less, also the drama suffers because of this wasted time and we learn nothing about the people other then they like money, also where was the score? i don't even think there was one, the drama suffers because of that too. Another flaw is the film is too long, I don't mind long movies, in fact i enjoy and prefer long movies, if it needs to be that long, because i feel a movie should be long to tell a whole story and be entertaining, but this one was easily 40 minutes too long, not that it couldn't be as long as it was, it just needs more to do with the characters, and less about money and who he was dating. There were only about 5 very interesting scenes all having do to with the actual aviation like the speed test, the crash (the best scene of the movie), the filming of hell angels, and the mental breakdown towards the end, which was even a little under acted and under played. It had very little, if not, no drama because we didn't learn anything about the characters, other then he had OCD, and they all wanted money. The story didn't feel like it was used, it felt incomplete, they was so much more they could have done, and it could have been very dramatic if there was a score, more character just in general at least, and if his mental breakdown had been more devastating then it was, i would think it deserved a best picture nomination, and even a director nomination, but since it was how it was, i don't think it deserves any other nominations then actor, actress, cinematography, and visuals. 7 out of a 10, barely."

","Leonardo DiCaprio IS Howard Hughes in the piece that should finally win Martin Scorsese that elusive Best Director Oscar.<br/><br/>Hughes biopics have been floating around Hollywood for decades. And no wonder - the story of Howard Hughes is an excellent example of the American dream being followed through to its conclusion. Tremendous, unprecedented power, fame, success, and wealth, followed by a massive, nearly unprecedented crash-and-burn. What could be more quintessentially American? Of course directors and producers have been scrambling all over each other to be the first to put a summation of Hughes' life on screen. A competing project starring Jim Carrey and directed by Christopher Nolan has been rumored for some time, in fact. But Scorsese got his out first, and I can't imagine that Nolan's film could possibly be any better.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, Howard Hughes was one of the great eccentric geniuses of this century. He was a film producer and director, an engineer, a pilot, a hotelier, and a crazy, crazy man. He ended his life in the suite of his Las Vegas hotel, which he hadn't left in twenty years. By that time, he was receiving daily blood transfusions from Mormons, who he believed were the only clean people in the world. He was no longer trimming his fingernails or cutting his hair or beard. He wore tissue boxes on his feet, and a surgical mask at almost all times. Terrified of germs, Hughes barricaded himself in his hotel and died there alone, sad, and insane. This would seem to me to be the most interesting part of Hughes' life to film - watching his madness devour him alive.<br/><br/>But no - Scorsese made the choice of allowing us to see Hughes in his younger, more vibrant days, and allowing us to watch the madness creep up on him instead.<br/><br/>The film opens as Hughes is filming ""Hell's Angels"", now nearly universally lauded as a masterpiece. He's throwing money at it hand over fist, but it's a passion, so he doesn't care. Genius or insanity?That's what Scorsese and DiCaprio bring across more than anything else here - the line between the two is so thin, it can be invisible in some cases. It certainly was with Hughes.<br/><br/>Eventually, Hughes gets into the airline business, founding TWA. He gets into a streetfight with PanAm, in the person of PanAm president Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin, enjoying being the bad guy) over who has the right to global flights. In between all the corporate and political intrigue, Hughes finds the time to fall madly in love with fellow outsider Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), and to dally with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). All along, Hughes struggles with his obsessive-compulsive tendencies, his most heroic moment coming when he overcomes his agoraphobia in order to testify before Congress (represented in the person of Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, a snarky Alan Alda) and save his company.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is the true savior of this movie, and Scorsese deserves credit just for getting out of his way. This is DiCaprio's chance to grow up as an actor, and he takes it and runs with it. It's difficult for a star of his caliber to be anything but Leo on screen, but he succeeds more than admirably in making you see Hughes instead of the movie star. He even comes to actually physically resemble the fortyish Hughes, a remarkable feat for a babyfaced thirty year old. It's a terrific performance, and one that should garnish Leo an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Also notable is Cate Blanchett's Katharine Hepburn - her performance is jarring at first, seemingly over-the-top, but once you settle in and realize that that's really how Hepburn WAS, it becomes fascinating. Her relationship with Hughes is heartbreaking. It's a case of two Hollywood outsiders who can't get past each other's eccentricities - a great romance cut short by neurosis. To me, the segment of the movie that examines their relationship is the best part of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a slick and good-looking film, which is almost enough to get you past its shallowness. But DiCaprio and Blanchett are both wonderful."

"dbuffalo","5","8","14","22 January 2005"," Little more than riveting eye candy....but the ride is enjoyable
","Martin Scorcese delves into the mastery, ego, and madness of oil, tool, cinema, and aviation magnate Howard Hughes and comes away once again (without as much blood spattering and violence) with an unspectacular but pretty period piece, best described as riveting eye candy. ""The Aviator"" is every bit as visually stunning and devoid of substance as ""Gangs of New York"". The cast, however, tries really hard to capture the mood of the era and the persistent force that Howard Hughes became to a generation that just preceded and endured the Second World War.<br/><br/>I am no fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I must give him credit for trying hard to capture a personality in this film. He looks way too young to be Hughes (though his age at filming was similar to the age of the character he portrays) but he gives his all in his attempt (and it's a great try) to encapsulate the hardheaded ego of Hughes, a man who refused failure and closeness simultaneously during his troubled lifetime. Cate Blanchett (who should still be publicly flogged for filming ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"") perhaps does the best long-form impersonation of a famous public figure in the history of film, and I mean that sincerely. We will never know the full vim (and vinegar) of Katherine Hepburn's private life because we could never see it. We have seen her characterizations on film, however. Cate captures, in her performance, a stunning replica of Hepburn's on-screen persona in what could have been the real role of Hepburn's life had she been able do it ( that is, to portray herself in an autobiographical role).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are dressed up for and act as period 1930s and 1940s personalities of the day. Even Alan Alda, who is not always much more than Hawkeye Pierce in any role he has ever done, is pretty convincing as the conniving Maine Senator Brewster.<br/><br/>I thought the Dicaprio scenes of madness were a bit overdone (we got the point early in the film) but the cinematography and general feel of the picture were fine other than that.<br/><br/>This is no Scorcese classic. However, the dude knows how to cash in on ""nice"" films. I am sure his more than ample retirement fund will be supplemented by the box office for this number. <br/><br/>If you want to laugh, cry (well not really), and kiss 10 bucks goodbye on a feel-good piece of post-art-deco-and-slightly-more-than-pap theater, then by all means, go see this. If ""The Aviator"" wins Best Picture, just realize that this has been very unspectacular year in cinema (unless of course you actually think anything by Michael Moore could be loosely considered cinema, then, of course, you need a red room just like Mr. Hughes).<br/><br/>For those of you who think all I do is hack bad films, you have been disappointed. Well not completely...<br/><br/>Here is the oddest sequence in this film. Leonard DiCaprio, a 31-year-old actor, looking younger than a 25-year-old Howard Hughes would have looked at the opening of his 1930 film ""Hell's Angels"" is arm-in-arm with 35-year-old (I have read she is actually 40) pseudo-teen-slut songstress Gwen Stefani attempting to portray a 19-YEAR-OLD Jean Harlow.<br/><br/>In 50 years, there will be a film on the life of Gwen Stefani called ""Tragic Kingdom"". In it, she will be found in a sealed room covered with red padded walls and rolling on the floor while listening to ""I'm Just a Girl"" or ""Spiderwebs"". The pounding of her fists on the floor will be peppered with her mumbling ""Take a chance you stupid ho!; Take a chance you stupid ho!"" The basic story of the movie will be how a troubled teen woman makes it from 16 to menopause without ever having lived a second of her life as a mature adult. <br/><br/>Note to Hollywood...don't take that chance, not even with another actress' ""million-dollar contract"". A 40-year-old playing a 19-year-old? 19-year-olds (other than Janis Joplin) never have facial lines. Come on now; you've got to be kidding me."
"rogerdarlington","8","8","14","8 January 2005"," Ambitous but flawed
","Any movie directed by Martin Scorsese has to be worth watching and this ambitious, if flawed, biopic of Howard Hughes is certainly well worth the price of a cinema ticket. As he did in ""Gangs Of New York"", Scorsese works with Leonard DiCaprio who here has the most challenging role of his career so far as the eponymous businessman, womaniser, flyboy, movie mogul, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder-sufferer. Thirty-year old DiCaprio works hard at the role and captures the manic energy, tortured expression and obsessive mannerisms of Hughes, but ultimately his boyish looks make this less than ideal casting. Except for a brief and unsatisfactory childhood scene, the film covers only the twenty years 1927-1947 of Hughes' 70 years, a period which enables Scorsese to present a remarkably sympathetic portrait of this complex character which underlines his great vision and commitment to competition - twin virtues of modern-day capitalism. The man's tyrannical behaviour is excused as the product of genius, while his anti-semitism and near fascist politics are overlooked entirely.<br/><br/>Cinema is first and foremost a visual medium and this movie is wonderful to look at. The grand sets and contemporary clothing - enhanced by music of the period - provide a rich evocation of the era, while the appearance in the narrative of so many movie stars of the time enhances the feeling that we have stepped back to a time when Americans were assuming leadership of the world. The realisations of these famous personages is uneven: while Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Katherine Hepburn and a paunchy Alec Baldwin convincing as Juan Trip, Kate Beckinsale is weak as Ava Gardner and Jude Law is disappointing as Errol Flynn.<br/><br/>The real stars of the movie, in many ways, are the aircraft, most of which are necessarily CGI creations. We feel with Hughes as he films from the sky swirling dog fights for his film ""Hell's Angels"", takes Hepburn night flying over Los Angeles, sets a new speed record, twice crashes experimental aircraft, and finally lifts the mammoth 'Moose Goose' a few feet off the water. This film of almost three hours is longer than it should have been, but it is at its most entertaining and exhilarating when it conveys the adrenalin excitement and social transformation of modern aviation."
"noralee","9","16","33","1 January 2005"," A Vivid Portrayal of a Crippled Colossus
","While ""The Aviator"" is Martin Scorsese as a for-hire director, he barrels into it with the same visual zeal for exposing the surface excesses and tragic consequences of unbridled capitalism of 1930's/'40's Hollywood and the aviation industry that he did for the Gilded Age of ""Age of Innocence"" and the Las Vegas of ""Casino."" <br/><br/>There is more than a passing resemblance to ""Citizen Kane"" in story arc and style as the outsider millionaire Howard Hughes seizes the popular imagination to take on The Establishment of the media moguls, business competition and the Congress while bedding stars and battling personal demons amidst a loyal coterie. The metaphors come together in a foreboding scene within the klieg lights of a Hollywood premiere as Hughes, with Jean Harlow on his arm in a cameo by Gwen Stefani, is blinded by light bulbs that crash onto a red carpet strewn with broken glass and is too deafened to partake in PR banter.<br/><br/>From the opening shots of the making of ""Hell's Angels"" Scorsese ties together the two improbable if it weren't true twin obsessions of Hughes, movies and airplanes, so we also see the source of the director's interest in the project. Scorsese's love of old movies comes through as he really gets into Hughes's upstart movie-making techniques outside the studio system and the ratings board. There's almost too many movie clips (though I've seen interviews where Scorsese's descriptions of the airplane footage in the original ""Hell's Angels"" are more thrilling than what's actually re-created here), but they serve as a haunting backdrop for Hughes's deterioration as he silhouettes against replays of his films like Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard."" <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is surprisingly and astoundingly effective as he wouldn't naturally seem to resemble the imposing Hughes. Perhaps that's why Scorsese uses an unusual, for him, number of close-ups which emotionally work as an entrÃ©e to Hughes's perceptions, enthusiasms and psychological problems. While DiCaprio is aided by excellent make-up and hair styling as he ages and the character matures and changes, the accent, body language, tortured expressions and seductive intensity are all his. The movie powerfully shows how involved the self-taught Hughes was in the design of his innovative planes and his gutsy piloting. I hope DiCaprio's youth appeal will bring in younger audiences, as the few in the audience I saw it with were clueless about the historical figures and references in the film.<br/><br/>I was leery of anyone taking on Katharine Hepburn so I was surprised not only how good Cate Blanchett was but even more surprised by her chemistry with DiCaprio, which I thought originally was as odd a casting pairing, as well, Hughes was with Hepburn. They really make it work, both together and in a fast-talking dinner with her intellectual, politically active Yankee family.<br/><br/>Alan Alda is terrific as the corrupt senator, but I was surprised that he had his New York accent rather than adopt a Down East one as he was supposed to be a Maine senator. Even in comparison to the climactic Senate hearings in ""The Godfather,"" this ping pong conflict is exciting, helped by the exaggerated production design and theatrical lighting that reflects how Hughes sees the match up in his shaky mental state. (There's no hearing room in Congress that large or would have photographers that close.) <br/><br/>Also in the ensemble Alec Baldwin and John C. Reilly are almost too restrained as, respectively, the Pan Am CEO and Hughes's COO. Ian Holm is delightful in a very small part that helps to show how Hughes kept around him a small group of loyalists who enabled his eccentricities. Jude Law as Erroll Flynn is a cameo and seems to be there only to represent the conventionally dissolute Hollywood as opposed to Hepburn and Hughes being in a parallel trajectory.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale is just pretty and has none of Ava Gardner's earthy presence nor brazenness. Even though she talks frankly, she is not a tough dame and she just seems to be playing dress-up in the extravagant period costumes.<br/><br/>Sandy Powell's period costumes are wonderful, even the men's clothes are eye-catching in how they set off the actors' bodies, yet are stylistically appropriate.<br/><br/>The production design is a bit over the top, but it emphasized how outsized Hughes's environment was, as a billionaire controlling a huge airplane factory and airline and as a Hollywood arriviste in the glamorous nightlife. The flying special effects, particularly of the breathtaking Beverly Hills crash, fit the overall tone.<br/><br/>The cinematography is ravishing, over a wide variety of settings and environments.<br/><br/>As usual for a Scorsese film the period song selections are superb. Stay through the credits to hear a Leadbelly song about Hughes. It's fun to see both Rufus and Loudon Wainwright as nightclub entertainers. Howard Shore's score is a bit overpowering, but does work with the exhilarating aerial shots."

"FilmSnobby","5","7","12","5 February 2005"," Fun flick. Not *Citizen Kane*, or anything, but fun.
","Perhaps if Scorsese hadn't been essentially BULLIED into making the film by Leonardo DiCaprio, the director might have TRIED to make *The Aviator* his own *Citizen Kane*. But since the idea wasn't Scorsese's own, he makes no particular effort to achieve artistic excellence, instead amiably agreeing to do some respectable hack-work. The idea here is to make a big entertaining picture. Scorsese succeeds.<br/><br/>Expect no more than that, however. *The Aviator* is ultimately a piece of corporate art, baiting Oscars. The canvas is unnecessarily large -- from the late 1920's to the late 1940's -- in the manner of your typical Oscar-hungry biopic. The movie sketches various aspects of Howard Hughes' professional and private life, from his monomaniacal auterist ambitions for the movie *Hell's Angels* (costing an inconceivable 4 million dollars -- the equivalent of about 700 or 800 million of today's dollars) to his uncanny futurist visions that prodded the budding aeronautical industry forward. Included are some gossipy interludes with Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. And, of course, we get the inevitable obsessive-compulsive disorder that stalked him, deteriorating his mind even as his career and legend rose to unprecedented heights.<br/><br/>But what does it all mean? In *Citizen Kane*, Orson Welles and writer Herman Mankiewicz spend the entire movie laying bare the life and motives of Charles Foster Kane: while, at the end of the picture, the shadowy reporters from the magazine stumble around Xanadu mouthing trite observations about a man's life being a puzzle, the audience has in the meantime learned where the missing pieces are located. Expect no such insight into Hughes in *The Aviator*. Why was Hughes so interested in airplanes, anyway? Why was he interested in the movies? Was the oil business (he had inherited his initial millions from a company that produced drill bits) really so much more boring than those other fields? -- and if so, why? Why was a man inflicted with a smörgåsbord of neuroses -- among them, intense dislike of crowds -- drawn to nightclubs and the Hollywood scene? Why was a man with a morbid fear of germs alley-catting around with every starlet in town? Why does this movie elide the subject of his several messy marriages? <br/><br/>Who knows? I keep reading here that the mystery of Hughes is what makes him so fascinating, and is what makes *The Aviator* a masterpiece . . . but isn't that a counterintuitive notion? If we're not going to learn about what made the man tick, then what's the point? Scorsese doesn't even offer a point of view about Hughes, after all is said and done. He just throws the man up there, with his brilliance and his madness, as if to say, ""YOU figure him out."" This strikes me as the height of laziness, but then, as I've said, this movie isn't really Scorsese's to begin with.<br/><br/>It's DiCaprio's, and he acts the hell out of the role, despite not really having the physical qualifications for it. I've always enjoyed DiCaprio as an actor -- his talent was always precocious, and now it has matured. I particularly enjoyed his work in the early scenes, when his obsessive-compulsive disorder manifested itself in a barely perceptible way. DiCaprio blanks out for just a second -- he disconnects. He plays the more moderate episodes with a mixture of menace and humor (the look on his face, half fear and half disgust, when he tells a colleague to wipe off a speck of dirt from his coat lapel, is a pretty magnificent thing to watch). He's less successful when he's going crazy in the film room, looking like a naked Jesus, but that's more the fault of the script, which should never take us to such ludicrously baroque extremes. I also enjoyed Cate Blanchette as Hepburn: she doesn't look like her in the least, but she captures Hepburn's peculiar voice and her overall persona superbly. Only a great actress can play one of our greatest actresses -- Blanchette fits that bill. In the final analysis, Scorsese must be praised for making such a CINEMATIC movie, if for nothing else. The flying scenes are exciting and easy to follow (the most spectacular is a crash-landing in 1940's Beverly Hills), the period details are sumptuous (Alec Baldwin's Pan-Am office, with its proto-Space Age decor, is a stand-out), and there are some great scenes for the actors (the best of which is a Dinner From Hell at the Hepburn estate). *The Aviator* is definitely a good time at the movies . . . although I suspect it was meant to be more than that. But in this degraded and degrading era for the movies, a good time is good enough for me.<br/><br/>5 stars out of 10."
"anachreon","10","7","12","29 January 2005"," The best American film since Citizen Kane
","A rare uniformity of talent and intelligence was brought to this project. John Logan's script is based on primary source research and reveals Hughes' character in a sequence of carefully deployed scenes that embody this in the context of the national hysteria (mania), which characterized the US from the end of of the 14-18 war through WW11. His seeming debilitating neuroses find a perfect psychiatric logic in that he sees the outer world as something which may come between him and his dream..a very rational view. The timing of his psychic crises always came as his dreams were most in peril and served the purpose of isolating him, protecting him from negative forces. His bacteriaphobia was symbolic and useful.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio (whose project this originally was) is astounding in his vision of Hughes and his realization of it. Again, Logan has provided the right words in the right place to carry this through. Cate Blanchett's Hepburn further confirms this actress's brilliance. She knows that an accent, a pattern of speech, are part and parcel of character and she portrayed this with an intelligent vibrancy seldom seen on the screen today. The supporting cast was uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>Scorsese had now made a great American film, his subject a very difficult one, but he shows the greatness of Howard Hughes, his flaws and debilities intertwined with his astounding abilities and imaginatively demonstrates them as inseparable and dynamically necessary.<br/><br/>The cinematography is the capstone of this achievement, just as it was in Welles' Citizen Kane. Combined with the editing, this is a visual as well as a textual masterpiece."

","'The Aviator' is an unusual film in the sense that it features the life of an unusual man. Howard Hughes, a pioneer in the history of aviation and cinema, two completely different fields. It is good that the movie showed enough of his contribution in the history of the former, as the name suggested. A movie meant as a biopic becomes an eye-candy the credit for which should not only go to the filmmakers but also the character Howard Hughes himself. Smart-looking planes, beautiful actresses of that time and also that plane crash in Beverly Hills sequence... all because of him. And it becomes perfect for a moviegoer when such a good plot comes with good acting.<br/><br/>It is indeed quite a treat to see all the good actors performing so well altogether. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply awesome. At first it appeared to me he is somehow miscast as Howard Hughes, perhaps because he doesn't just look like him. But his acting was so wonderful that I can't think of anyone right now that could replace him. He definitely deserves his Oscar this time. The changes of Hughes' character with time is brilliantly portrayed, with some scenes where Leonardo proves his mastery like the days inside the hotel room or the last shot of Senate hearing or ""Show me all the blueprints"". Apart from him, 'The Aviator' is also Cate Blanchett's best work. Her appearance was perfect for Katharine Hepburn and she got the accent big time. She just defeated her works in 'Veronica Guerine' or 'Elizabeth'. John Reilly is good as always, so was Kate Beckinsale. I actually would love to see Scarlett Johansson as Ava Gardner but Kate is okay. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, however, are not upto that level. And oh yes, as long as we're speaking about acting, let's not forget the brilliant cameo by Jude Law as Eroll Flynn.<br/><br/>The point is, all these decent performances by the actors could not make it the best film of the year. 'Aviator' has got a number of problems. The movie is nearly three hours long and it loses track in the middle. The first hour of the movie is very good and interconnected. But after that it just became a collection of separate events glued together. 'Aviator' was never meant to be a documentary film with actors. But that's what it became in the end. Personally I think the film aspect of Hughes' life should have been shown more, along with the aviation aspect of course. Sometimes it appeared filled with too much detailing and unnecessary shots like the opening scene or that scene of urinating in the bottles etc. As a director, Scorsese could not surpass his earlier works like 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver' or even 'Gangs of New York' with this one. Interesting and unexpected plot twists or showing violence in a simple careless manner, what were his trademark, are absent here. As he didn't get his Oscar from the said three films, I highly doubt he will make it this time. On the other hand, Eastwood has done a hell of a work with 'Million Dollar Baby'.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","8","17 February 2005"," Certainly a BIG movie, but NOT necessarily a GREAT movie
","Just like Gangs of New York, The Aviator is another of Scorsese's attempt at an epic movie. The two movies even started out in exactly the same way, a close-up shot of an object (shaver in one; soap and towel in the other) against a background of a mellow, rich, orange-brown hue. Into Gangs of New York Scorsese poured his passion for the title city, which is featured just as prominently as the characters in the story. The Aviator, lacking the drive from such passion, came out the weaker of the two. Obviously, legendary Howard Hughes, with all his eccentricities and charisma, fascinates the audience. Whether he can elicit much empathy from them, however, is another matter.<br/><br/>Rather than a biopic (as the movie stops short of Hughes' declining years), The Aviator comes across more like a cross sectional exploration into Hughes' character. Linking the various cross sections are three consistent themes: his passion for aviation, his obsession with cleanliness and his involvement with Hollywood.<br/><br/>As underpinned by the title, Hughes is first and foremost the aviator. That is why the movie ends with his triumphantly taking the mega plane Hercules into the air.<br/><br/>The very first and last shots in the movie, however, have been devoted to Hughe's eccentric obsession: beginning with his mother bathing him, as a boy, warning him about germs and teaching him the word ""quarantine"", and ending in a relapse of his obsessive-compulsive disorder triggered by the recurring paranoia. However, it is interesting to note that these obsessions seem to be selective. Hughes is clearly not bothered by the close contact with Katharine Hepburn when he teaches her to fly a plane, nor by sharing an ice cream with Faith Domergue. In fact, the former scene is place immediately after one in which he reacts vehemently to having a few peas from his plate picked up by Errol Flynn. One can't help but wonder if there's an intended message here.<br/><br/>The third theme, his link with Hollywood, is seen in his relationship with various women - two big stars Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner plus a parade of starlets. Hughes is portrayed in these relationships as flamboyant, at time callous and insensitive, and even juvenile. But then there must have been redeeming qualities in the man because at his lowest point, in his self-imposed quarantine in a screening room, both women come to help - one his once had and lost (Hepburn); the other he never had (Gardner).<br/><br/>The most favorable portrayal of Hughes in this movie is in the congressional hearings scene close to the end, because we all love an underdog, even if the underdog is a billionaire. Who can resist applauding a little poetic justice, as outspoken Hughes just about turns a hearing of his alleged war-profiteering around into an enquiry into the corruption of Senator Ralph Owen Brewster who was bought by Hughes' arch competitor Juan Trippe.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio handles well the various facets of this complicated man, except for the greatness (a limited definition of ""greatness"" in this context). Cate Blanchett, as Hepburn, is magnificent and wonderful as always. Beautiful Kate Beckinsale plays beautiful Ava Gardner beautifully. Prolific C. Reilly (he was in BOTH New York Gangs and Chicago) proves once again that he is worth the price, as Hughes' loyal aids. Alec Baldwin is a convincingly ruthless Pan Am chief. Good old Alan Alda (from the good old M.A.S.H.) demonstrates that his vintage gets better with aging, as we see him as the venomously sly Senator. For eye-opening cameos we have Judd Law as Flynn and Willem Dafoe as the newspaperman forced to sell back compromising Hepburn/Tracy photos of by Hughes' McCarthism threats (a weapon that works when all else have failed). And don't forget Ian Holm's (Bilbo) portrayal of the lovable Professor Fitz.<br/><br/>Incidentally, pitched against Chicago in the Oscar contest two years ago, Gangs of New York scored a blank out against the former's six, as I put in my summary line for my comments no the 75th Award Show: ""Bears 6; Giants 0"". It will be interesting to see in a week's time if a similar fate awaits The Aviator."

","Martin Scorsese's take on a 20 year period in Howard Hughes' life can only be called spectacular. This film has had me raving since the first time I saw it several weeks back. It is an epic that has everything that makes an epic film extraordinary with its story of a person who are bigger than life itself, combined with great visual effects, wonderfully colorful performances, and exposing the utter genius of Hughes, ""The Aviator"" proves not only be entertaining, but enlightening. Opening with the shot of Hughes as a boy being bathed by his mother and her spelling the word 'quarantine' to him, she instills a fear of disease on what was a fragile mind. We watch how Hughes subtly becomes obsessed with his business ventures into TWA airlines, his scandalous movies, and his building of the world's largest airplane, the Hercules. Furthermore, we see an intimate look at the man from escapades with teenage girls to Hollywood actresses Eva Gardener and Katharine Hepburn, played by Kate Beckinsale and Cate Blanchette, respectively. Blanchette's performance as Hepburn is so colorful and amusing that she proves to be the film's most intriguing performance. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes in an excellent performance. The only thing that works against DiCaprio is that he physically looks young, a look he's had trouble shedding considering he is in his early 30s. But it is easy to disregard considering his dialogue delivery and movements are superb. The film flows at a furious rate for a three hour picture and it manages to hold the audience's attention the whole period without succumbing to a single dull moment. Simply put, ""The Aviator"" is the best film of 2004!"
"janet_sullivan","10","5","8","19 January 2005"," A moving and heartbreaking story
","I went into the theater humongously skeptical about Leonardo DiCaprio, who seemed too boyish and callow to play Hughes, but came out a true believer. The film was incredibly moving and heartbreaking. Cate Blanchett overdid Kate Hepburn a bit, and Kate Beckinsale, who played Ava Gardner, had none of Ava's edge and sophistication and world-weariness (and no one will ever be that beautiful), and seemed to be playing dress-up most of the time, but those were not big quibbles for me.<br/><br/>To watch the gradual descent of this man, who had so much passion and promise, was absolutely devastating, and presented with great care and dignity. Unlike most films that deal with mental illness, the human being came through quite clearly. As usual, Scorcese told a complex story with great wit, compassion, and insight, and tremendous drama and flair. And I didn't realize how long it was until I looked at the time when I left the theater, which is a good sign."
"Simon_peters","3","8","15","8 January 2005"," Bloated, devoid of human interest.
","As demonstrated by the tedious ""The Gangs of New York"", Scorcese seems to be a spent force. Overwhelmed by large set pieces, we are left indifferent to Hughes' struggles. Scenes are left to play indulgently long, and, as well as endless captions telling us how much time has gone by, and where the scenes are taking place, characters are endlessly coming on and introducing themselves, and their relationships: ""Yes, Howard, I am Ava Gardner, and if you want to know if I slept with Arty Shaw, and whether I am interested in Frank Sinatra - the answer is Yes"" is a paraphrase of one of the more clunking bits of dialogue. Cate Blanchett merely mimics Katherine Hepburn's speech patterns and shouts a lot, while Jude Law wears a moustache, and keeps his eyes wide open, in an attempt to impersonate Clark Gable.<br/><br/>Hughes crashing an aircraft is an excuse for Scorcese to indulge his taste for making sure that any damage to a human body is as explicit and unpleasant to look at as ever.<br/><br/>Otherwise much effort has gone into recreating lavish evocations of period, and, interestingly, the overall effect is as unengaging as ""The Cotton Club"" was for Coppola. In the end if you don't have human interest in a script then you have nothing. Aviator is an expensive lesson for Scorcese, for Miramax, and, ultimately, for the audience that this remains a universal truth."
"SashaWrites","3","8","15","30 December 2004"," There could have been a lesson to this movie
","There could have been a lesson to this movie. Instead, the whole painful three hours skirted around it, whitewashing a truth that was far more interesting than this odd portrait of Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>In his prime, Howard Hughes was 6'4"" tall and strong: a strapping man. When he died, he weighed 93 pounds. One of the striking images of my youth, was that of this shriveled, white-bearded little human being carried to the car by his bodyguard. Howard Hughes had become a tiny, grotesque, skeletal puppet.<br/><br/>Watching ""The Aviator"" was not unlike the tour of Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley. In both places, we are treated to a view of the eccentric and wonderful genius, but something is left out.<br/><br/>And that thing, is the drugs.<br/><br/>Yes, Hughes was obsessive-compulsive, germ-phobic to a point of the bizarre, but his paranoias were increased, honed, finally made all-encompassing by something far more understandable  his drug addiction.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes did indeed have the enormous plane wreck that's depicted mid-way through ""The Aviator."" The amount of morphine, codeine, and goodness knows what else that would have been necessary to treat that much burn tissue, broken ribs, and collapsed lung, would make an addict out of anyone. Add a compulsive and addictive personality, and all the money in the world, and it's not hard to understand what happened to Hughes.<br/><br/>What is hard to understand, is why that wasn't in Scorsese's movie.<br/><br/>In one interesting scene, we see Ava Gardner reappear in Hughes' life to get him ready to appear before a congressional hearing. Hughes had locked himself in his movie studio, and then in a wing of his mansion, refusing to touch anything, delusional, insane. In scriptwriter John Logan's version, Gardner shaves him, cleans him up, gives him a pep talk, and this cures his insanity and he's ready to go head to head with the United States Senate.<br/><br/>This makes no sense, of course. And how much more sense, how much more interesting and valuable an episode could this have been, if we saw what seems far more likely: that what Gardner did, was truly to ""clean him up."" She got him sober. She put him back together, straightening him out just long enough that he could face something other than his drug-strengthened demons.<br/><br/>There are great bits in this movie, strong parts that contribute to the tragedy of this movie's inevitable vacuousness. Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn is so spot-on that it's funny, and finally even touching. When a film is released in December, you know that they're shooting for Oscars, and this one is surely aimed at getting a nomination for DiCaprio, but he's miscast. Hughes by all accounts was large, terse, intense, and DiCaprio is too energetic and boyish for this mature role. The camera and visual direction are lovely, if too long. The aviation scenes are fabulous.<br/><br/>OK, so perhaps a defense of ""The Aviator"" would go like this: this movie wasn't supposed to be about drugs. It was about Hughes in a few years of his life when he was directing movies and changing the world of aviation, which he surely and undoubtedly did. It's about the congressional investigation and his start into the world of madness. Presenting the drugs would have made it, finally, a picture about an addict, instead of about an aviator.<br/><br/>If so, then the my-mom-told-me-germs-are-bad didn't need the massive play it got. The mental illness it too central to the entire picture. Personality disorder is the driving force of ""The Aviator,"" and it's wrong.<br/><br/>That defense doesn't work, furthermore, when the movie claims to be a biography, and anyway the essence needn't be ""Howard Hughes in Trainspotting."" If ""The Aviator's"" Hughes had, locked in his studio, taken some pills just once; if Ava Gardner had shown up in his mansion and thrown away the prescription bottles; these small gestures would have made the point about the truth without becoming a preachy anti-drug lecture. Instead, it made up a fiction.<br/><br/>By the end of this film, I practically wanted to stand up and shout at the entire audience, ""He was a drug addict! When he died, he weighed 90 pounds! What is this nonsense?"" Instead, I just left, and returned home to look up one glowing review after another on the internet. One of Time Magazine's reviewers has put it on the top of his ""Best"" list for 2004. Time Magazine was the one that had that famous picture of the shriveled and near-death Hughes on its cover, in 1976. (http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101761213,00.html)<br/><br/>Removing the drugs from the lives of Howard Hughes, and Elvis Presley, is not a virtuous whitewash that allows us to retain our heroes. Rather, it loses the value of the tragedy. When I was a high school teacher, I could look kids in the eye who were starting to experiment and say to them: ""Look at the people lying on the street in their stupors, and ask yourself: 'How many of these people thought they were going to become addicts?' The answer is none. 'How many of them thought, as you do, ""That won't happen to me. I'm different. I can take it or leave it as I wish""?' The answer is all of them. They're just like you.""<br/><br/>Addiction could happen to hard-working, generous, perspicacious, brilliant men such as Howard Hughes, and Elvis Presley. And look what it did to them. This story would have been a far, far more interesting, compelling, and honest film, than this look-at-the-nutcase bit of Hollywood tinsel.<br/><br/>Instead, this movie does something that Hughes, himself, might very well have appreciated, something that he did while in Hollywood. It told a story full of pretty faces and dishonesty: one that didn't make very much sense.<br/><br/>Perhaps there was a lesson to this movie, after all."
"Red-Barracuda","8","3","4","21 December 2016"," Sorsese and DiCaprio deliver great work here
","The Aviator is another dynamic film from Martin Scorsese. He has employed his energetic style to the story of the Hollywood mogul / aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, the result is a fast-paced and entertaining biopic. It's a more restrained effort than Scorsese usually delivers and it's pretty obvious that it was going very much for a PG-13 rating given the very blatant method of including one f-bomb to affect this. So the material, while still showing the darker aspects of the title character, nevertheless whitewashes him considerably too – in real life he seemed to be anti-Semitic and racist, while he also killed someone due to dangerous driving (neither of these two aspects made it into this film). What we do see is still a man with many flaws though with his recklessness, excessive perfectionism, womanising and germ phobia. Leonardo DiCaprio really is excellent in the part it has to be said and shows again just what a skilled actor he really is.<br/><br/>Unusually for a biopic the story begins with Hughes already a millionaire and in the middle of making the World War I fighter-plane epic Hell's Angels. We see the money he threw at this picture and his perfectionist attitude leading to it being a very elongated shoot. Despite the film's huge success, he was never fully accepted by the Hollywood old boy's network and was considered an outsider. It's this aspect that has been used to make a hero of Hughes in this film, a man against the system if you will; even though I am sure the truth was less clear-cut given his massive wealth and more unsavoury character traits. Whatever the case, we see him push the boundaries of acceptability in movies with his violent crime film Scarface (1932) and his racy feature film The Outlaw (1943), we see him design ever more ambitious planes, we hear of him circumnavigating the world, and testing aircraft himself (this includes an expertly filmed sequence where Hughes crashes one of his planes into the middle of a populated area), we witness him founding his own airline TWA and in the process gain powerful business and political enemies which leads to a congressional investigation and finally we see a man suffering from paranoia who becomes a mentally ill recluse.<br/><br/>The story of Hughes life certainly was a dramatic one and Scorsese presents it as such. He even had romances with Katharine Hepburn (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), which adds a glamorous social life to his high profile public achievements. The lush period detail adds a great deal to proceedings with a beautiful look maintained throughout. Scorsese even went so far as to use an old two-strip Technicolor process for the cinematography which leads to the strange moments where we see fields and golf courses replete with blue grass. So, all-in-all, this amounts to another typically well executed, handsome-looking and energetic effort from Scorsese and his first genuinely great collaboration with DiCaprio."
"tomsview","6","3","4","9 February 2013"," Grounded indefinitely
","Much like the 'Spruce Goose', Scorsese's film about Howard Hughes is big, shiny and taxis around for nearly two and a half hours before taking off for a very brief flight.<br/><br/>Many actors love to play eccentric characters. However few films have successfully embraced eccentricity; eccentric characters are too self-obsessed, and disinterested in the affect they have on others to engage the audience's sympathies for very long.<br/><br/>And so it is with Martin Scorsese's film about eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Although Leonardo DiCaprio embraces the Hughes' traits – the childish enthusiasm, the eccentricity and the quirky, compulsive habits – he is unable to make his character anything other than irritating.<br/><br/>The film opens as Hughes directs his World War 1 flying movie, ""Hell's Angels"", and introduces the first of many real-life characters including Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn. Eagerly anticipated is the arrival of Kate Hepburn played by Cate Blanchett, and it is almost a relief when she finally enters the film.<br/><br/>Katherine Hepburn, who had a long affair with Hughes during the 1930's, also had one of the most distinctive personalities of all Hollywood actresses – her voice and mannerisms were favourites of impersonators for decades. Blanchett does an impressive job as Hepburn, wisely underplaying and not overdoing the voice. The movie slackens considerably when she leaves the story. Hughes also had an affair with Ava Gardner played by Kate Beckinsale who hardly changes gear in her characterisation.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCapri works hard in the scenes of Hughes' breakdown caused by a combination of external pressures, serious injuries and inner turmoil. After a series of investigations by senate committees and the FBI, the film closes as Hughes realises, just as Charles Foster Kane does in ""Citizen Kane"", that no matter the power and wealth he has amassed, he no longer feels the happiness and security he felt as a child.<br/><br/>In playing Senator Owen Brewster, who investigates Hughes' airline towards the end of the film, Alan Alda is unable to move away from his Hawkeye Pierce persona from MASH, delivering yet another variation on the Groucho Marx wisecracking style – not so much funny as relentless.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin is far more effective as Juan Trippe who eventually brings about the financial collapse of Hughes' Aviation enterprise.<br/><br/>The film has a number of exciting and beautifully shot aerial sequences, two spectacular crashes and the flight of Hughes' over-sized seaplane, the 'Spruce Goose'. All helped along by Howard Shore's soaring score; by turns triumphant, elegant and questioning. It's possibly one of the best scores of the last 5 years.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" is an overlong flight that encompasses much of Hughes' life without shedding much light on what made the man tick. Finally, if we are left with one insight, it is that the capriciousness of very rich, spoilt people can cause a great deal of annoyance to the rest of us."
"StevePulaski","10","3","4","27 February 2012"," Soaring yet falling
","The Aviator is, yet another, Scorsese masterpiece that deals with the life and glory of a character I would've never seen myself liking so much. The story is focused on Howard Hughes, a character who, undoubtedly, is foreign to many people in the present. Hughes inherited his parents' fortune at twenty-two, directed the most expensive movie at the time, spent money worse than a drunken sailor, and was building planes that were set to be used by the Army Air Forces. Enigmatic, yes. But far from a feasible hero.<br/><br/>Hughes is played effortlessly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He has already established that he'll take any role, from J. Edgar to a man on a doomed ship, and he has been on a continuing streak of fantastic films. We can pretend Romeo and Juliet never existed. Here, he accepts the challenge to focus on the glory years of Hughes (1927 to around the early forties), where he was living the dream, then quickly becoming his own worst enemy. DiCaprio's challenge is also presented when he must transition Hughes delicately from a fully functioning, money-hungry womanizer to a slowly, defeatist madmen without overacting or hammering home on the clichés. The result is beyond commendable.<br/><br/>Hughes, himself, was a man that possessed energy, efficiency, courage, and determination in limitless amounts. He had the ability to pick up any woman he wanted, say anything he wanted, and casually ask a woman to marry him like one would say ""pass the salt."" Not only was he a professional ladies man, he was a surreal filmmaker, directing a film called Hell's Angles at twenty-two. After two years of unprecedented hell trying to get the film shot efficiently, right down to cloud formations, he casually tells his business executive, Noah Dietrich (Reily) that he'd like to reshoot it, this time, occupying sound to please a demanding audience. Was he completely unaware of the time and money he put into the silent version, or just a reckless spender of money? Going back to his womanizing ways, one woman Hughes put through hell and high-water was Katharine Hepburn (Blanchett). She had to put up with his increasing OCD habits, not to mention once his name became big because of Hell's Angles, all the starlets that would inevitably follow. She left him soon after, much to his dismay.<br/><br/>What did Hughes do maybe achieve closure or ease the pain? Become involved with more women. One of them was fifteen year old Faith Domergue (Garner) and another being the amazingly beautiful Ava Gardner (Beckinsale).<br/><br/>After his work behind the camera, Hughes put films in the foreground, as he wanted to focus on something bigger; aircrafts. He loved them more than life itself. He had a monstrous idea; to build a blame that could float on water and soar higher than plausible. He would name it ""Hercules,"" a name of piercing accuracy.<br/><br/>The art direction is extraordinary. One of the most thrilling scenes involves something Scorsese rarely uses, but when it is applied, he always uses effectively; special effects. The scene involves Hughes crash-landing in Beverly Hills with the wing of the plane slicing the rooftops of houses like a table saw cutting through a tin can. This scene is fantastic because it doesn't focus on the awesomeness of it all, but it the peril and the exhilaration Hughes must have felt while in the plane. His struggle to get out is absolutely haunting and impossible to ignore.<br/><br/>Apparently, Scorsese mimicked the bipack color scheme used in films back in the day. This adds sort of a lighter, ""easy on the eyes"" kind of tonality that I have not experienced in films in a long time. Green objects appear to be blue, and some of the later scenes are shots using three strip Technicolor. Not only does Scorsese utilize old technology to tell a timeless story, he presents it the way it would've been told back then. Colorized stock footage mainly makes up the aerial battles, which are wonderfully coherent and intense as can possibly be.<br/><br/>Another thing to pay close attention to are the planes. They are scale models, rather than computer creations. This, again, adds to the ""easy on the eyes"" tonality. Everything is natural and looks ravishing, better than anything that could've been created from a software program. It only provides to the already extremely genuine picture we are watching.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes was determined, enigmatic, energetic, courageous, yet a sad figure overall. A man consumed by his fear and his uncontrollable OCD. The later scenes of his life, which I dare not spoil, are so devastating and upsetting they are sometimes hard to watch. Here's a man that had it all, then plummeted into a dark, endless hole of murkiness never to be mentioned again until his tragic death in 1976. Rather than plod along through the most likely noneventful teen years leading up to the production of Hell's Angles, The Aviator chooses to reestablish the glory days of Hughes. The film omits the darker days of Hughes life, such as the sixties and the seventies. What we're supposed to feel at the end is unclear, but one thing is for sure, if we walked out sad, it would be extremely out of place.<br/><br/>Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale, John C.

","Those of us familiar with Scorsese's long career know what we're seeing - the ideal vehicle (Hughes' story) for him to reflect on and direct commentary right back at himself.<br/><br/>Scorsese spent much of his early years pushing against similar 'Code' restrictions on sex and violence in film. He put manic energy into everything he did, and survived addiction (paralleled in this movie as the womanizing and obsessive-compulsions). He later battled skeptics and naysayers who questioned his budgets.<br/><br/>But what makes this worth watching as a movie is the completion of his paradigm shift from character excess and character fixation to the ability to capture a world and move about it as he wills. ""Gangs..."" hinted at this, but tripped over its detail-consciousness. Here the camera is free to explore; we get narrative -flow-. There are virtually no face close-ups; the emphasis is always on the surrounding space.<br/><br/>And DiCaprio acquits himself mightily here.

"fullonrobotchubby","8","3","4","17 August 2006"," A biography that stands out in a year loaded with biographies.
","I have a little beef with most of the movies that came out toward the end of 2004: a lot, a LOT of them were biographies that were undoubtedly going for the Oscar, which was why I was rooting for Million Dollar Baby, Sideways, and anything else that was an original idea with fictional characters and a chance that audiences wouldn't get it. Its not that I hate biographies, but all this overexposure to them made me aware that they all have the feel of, well, like my brother puts it, ""This person is really important and heres why."" Thats why I've come to the conclusion that my judgments of biographical films will mostly depend on the relevance of the subject/person, which may sound shallow, but this is OUR money and time, folks.<br/><br/>The Aviator, the story of moviemaker/pilot/screwball Howard Hughes, makes the cut because while some of the ideas feel reheated, the film as a whole feels less reheated than its Best Picture opponents Finding Neverland and Ray, respectively. Hughes was quite a psychopathic study that is often referenced and/or the inspiration to other nutjob characters (I can think of one in John Grisham's novel The Pelican Brief). Why he went haywire remains a mystery today, but Martin Scorsese's film implies it was due to a combination of stressful events throughout his long drive to be somebody and his anal retentive disorder. While most of the cast is pretty much miscast (I'm glancing at Kate Beckinsale, but I'm staring a hole through Gwen Stefani), Cate Blanchett's winning performance of trend-setting screen legend Katharine Hepburn is spot on. The M*A*S*H-er Alan Alda is a hoot as the punk of the plot; it's just no fun waiting through half the movie for him. On the other hand, if the film did anything lasting on me, it cemented my opinion that Leonardo DiCaprio should be called an actor before he can be called an aging heartthrob. In fact, I'd venture to say he probably should've beat Jamie Foxx for Best Actor. My favorite scene is the can't-look-away crash of the XF-11 in the California neighborhood; from what I read, every detail of the scene was truthfully done, including how lucky Hughes was to survive it. I know, there are plenty of how the brain works movies out there these days, but this Citizen Kane-like film contains one of the most accountable tales on the subject and is shown with as much clarity as Scorsese could. And again, DiCaprio delivers like the pro he is."
"kenjha","8","3","4","11 August 2006"," A Long Flight
","Overlong but generally engaging biography of the legendary Howard Hughes. DiCaprio is quite believable as the high-flying millionaire. Blanchett is also convincing as Katherine Hepburn. An all-star cast fills out the rest of the cast. This one could have used a good editor as Scorcese decides to give us a complete portrait of Hughes, warts and all, as in nearly three hours of ALL. The scenes of Hughes' withdrawal into a darkened room drag on way too long. The film is at its best in the early parts as Hughes starts his Hollywood career. There is a hilarious scene where Hughes has Prof. Fritz (Holm) explain to the censor's board why Jane Russell's breasts are not obscene."

","This comment on THE AVIATOR deals with the motion picture itself, not with its biographical aspects, since I know too little of the facts concerning Howard Hughes' life.<br/><br/>I can say right away that this movie kept my interest, even with its 170 minutes running time. In fact, I wouldn't have mind to see it even a bit longer by adding a few scenes concerning the controversy and release of Hughes' movie ""The Outlaw"". I eagerly wanted to know more about it. When looking at the story, Scorsese choose to ignore the common rules of scriptwriting. Understandingly, since this is a biography. The film has a spectacular opening, then is toned down a bit and uses a slower pace when it comes to the development of events.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio took some time to convince me as Howard Hughes. Don't get me wrong, 'cause in this movie he really proves what a great actor he is, no doubt (pun intended, get it?) about that. But it's just that I found him a bit too young to portray Howard Hughes, especially since he doesn't seem to age much throughout the movie. But he did a very good job on portraying Hughes' mental decay. I wasn't quite too fond on the way Cate Blanchett played Katharine Hepburn. She came on a bit too strong and slightly unlikeable. Maybe this was an accurate portrayal of Ms. Hepburn, but since I'm not very familiar with that actress, I rest my case. The rest of the acting was, as to be expected, very good.<br/><br/>I also liked the way the cinematography showed a lot of different tones in color, hereby indicating the different episodes in the time-line of the story. The CGI of the airplane could have used a little more detail, if you ask me. There was even a big error, easily spotted. When Hughes has his attempt to set a new speed-record, the close-up shots of the airplane (with DiCaprio in it) show an open cockpit. The more distant CGI-shots show a closed cockpit. Also DiCaprio's hair doesn't move while flying with an open cockpit (but when he crashes in the field, it does). A few other unrealistic shots are to be found when it comes to special effects, but I won't bother going into them.<br/><br/>I ended up liking this movie more than I expected, but it didn't have the same impact as, for example, A BEAUTIFUL MIND (which I consider to be a much better movie). So THE AVIATOR is just a great movie, but certainly no masterpiece."

","I saw this Biography of Howard Hughes and I enjoyed it. I was a fascinating glimpse of a man who has become known for his eccentric behavior, and as the guy who died in Las Vegas as an insane old man. Howard Hughes is remembered by most people as a shadowy figure. What I like about this movie is that it brings the character to life, and makes him into an actual human being, and into someone who we can understand.<br/><br/>I have never been a big fan of Leo DiCaprio before, but I thought he acted the part well in this movie. When I saw him, I saw Howard Hughes. He really brought the man to life in a believable way. I also enjoyed the special effects in the film. Most notable for me is the scene when he has the accident in Hollywood. That was really powerfully done.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a must watch for anyone interested in Howard Hughes, the early history of Hollywood, or for anyone who is just interested in a well told story about one of the more enigmatic and interesting people to ever come out of it."

","There were some fine performances in this movie, and it reminded me of Citizen Kane in its approach to the life of a ruthless businessman, but I wasn't gripped by it and Hughes' character was so unsympathetic that I couldn't engage with him. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Hepburn was excellent and I loved her (being a true Hepburn fan, I wasn't offended). I understood the technical excellence of the cinematography, but I need to feel involved in a story and Hughes behaviour was repellent enough to distance me completely. DiCaprio was good, but I couldn't see him as an older man later on in the story - possibly he lacked the weight required to show middle age convincingly. I lost interest well before the end, I'm afraid."
"sddavis63","7","3","4","1 January 2006"," The Life, Loves And Lunacy Of Howard Hughes
","In what is surely his finest performance since ""Titanic,"" Leonardo DiCaprio manages to pull off a brilliant portrayal of the early years of the eccentric (and insane) multi-millionaire Howard Hughes. The first part of the movie deals with the filming and production of ""Hell's Angels"" - Hughes' motion picture about World War I aviators, and it served as an appropriate introduction to a movie that revolved around (as the title suggests) Hughes' fascination with aviation.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is brilliant as he portrays Hughes' gradual descent into insanity. At first, as the movie opens, Hughes displays mild eccentricities (we would probably say today that he suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder.) DiCaprio manages to subtly show us Hughes becoming worse and worse until eventually he loses all touch with reality, managing to return to normalcy for a monumental battle with a Senate Committee over his airline's desire to begin transcontinental flights. Alan Alda was quite good in his role as Senator Brewster, the chair of the Committee, and someone in the pocket of the head of Pan Am Airlines (played by Alec Baldwin.) The depiction of the Senate hearing was brilliant, and left no doubt that Brewster - knowing of Hughes' fragile mental state - was an utterly beaten man, obviously taken completely off guard by a totally in control Hughes.<br/><br/>The film depicts Hughes' various romances, focusing especially on those with Katherine Hepburn (Kate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), which served as an opportunity to show Hughes' growing paranoia. The last scene of the movie is particularly haunting to anyone who knows how Hughes' life turned out. The relationship with Gardner (and the role she played in getting him on his feet before the Senate Committee hearings) was especially interesting.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie very much, although it seemed that it dragged a bit in places. Perhaps at times it became a bit too concerned with details (not unlike Hughes himself, actually) and, if we were going to get an almost 3 hour movie about Hughes, it might have been more satisfying to have less detail about these particular years and extend the movie into Hughes' later years. Perhaps fodder for a sequel. Having said that, this is a very good and very interesting movie, which I rate as a 7/10."
"Buddy-51","8","3","4","24 August 2005"," flawed but compelling look at a visionary
","It ain't always easy being a visionary and an innovative genius - just ask Howard Hughes, the renowned millionaire, who had three main ambitions in life: to build the fastest airplanes, to make the biggest movies, and to become the richest man in the world. That he achieved those lofty goals at a very great personal cost to himself is what makes his story the stuff of legend. For Hughes also suffered from the demon of mental illness, which manifested itself in chronic obsessive/compulsive behavior, a neurotic fear of germs, and acute paranoia. Martin Scorsese captures all facets of this larger-than-life figure in ""The Aviator,"" a high-flying epic that does justice to a man who became a national icon and the embodiment of the American dream despite his internal weaknesses - and whose legend lives on today.<br/><br/>John Logan's script spends virtually no time on Hughes' youth except for a brief prologue which shows Howard's hypochondriac mother planting those seeds of fear in his tender psyche that would haunt him the rest of his life. The story proper begins with Hughes' efforts to produce what would turn out to be the most expensive film ever made up to that time, the war epic ""Hell's Angels,"" a non-studio work that allowed Hughes to combine his twin loves of movie-making and aviation. If nothing else, Hughes thought BIG, and his capriciousness and profligacy, as reflected in the mounting budget of the film he was making, also spilled over into the realm of aviation, as he began looking for ways to create ever more aerodynamic airplanes at greater and greater cost. His obsession with size culminated in the creation of the ill-fated Spruce Goose, the largest airplane ever made - and one whose airborne career lasted exactly one flight.<br/><br/>Logan and Scorcese also focus on the personal side of Hughes' life, concentrating specifically on his tumultuous affairs with Katharine Hepburn (brilliantly played by Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). His relationship with Hepburn is a particularly telling one because they seem to understand one another so well - so well, in fact, that they are unable to make a permanent go of things and wind up going their separate ways.<br/><br/>As director, Scorcese brings his usual flair and visual inventiveness to the film, soaring highest - as is appropriate, perhaps - in the aviation sequences. The first hour, in particular, moves at a breathless clip, as he weaves the various strands of his epic - yet, at the same time, intimate - story into a cohesive whole. If the truth be told, at 170 minutes, the movies does run a little too long and it sags a bit in its middle section. However, as Hughes begins to unravel psychologically - at one point locking himself in a screening room barely clinging to what little remains of his sanity - the movie becomes a sad but fascinating study of a man in the throes of a nervous breakdown. The scene in which Hepburn converses with Hughes through a locked door, pleading with him to let her come in and help him, is heartbreaking in its poignancy.<br/><br/>As Hughes, Leonardo Di Caprio carries the weight of the film on his frail shoulders, and he does a superb job, hitting new dramatic heights in the scenes in which he both falls to pieces psychologically and rises confidently to the challenge of clearing his good name in a senate hearing. Alan Alda is also terrific as the senator from Maine determined to get Hughes to sell TWA to Pan Am in order to achieve a monopoly on international flight carriers in the future.<br/><br/>The first half of the 20th Century provided fertile soil for individuals like Hughes to grow and flourish, men with the brains to see what the future offered and the guts to reach out and go for it. The film captures the era beautifully through the art deco architecture, the dazzling sets and costumes, and a nostalgia-evoking soundtrack overflowing with familiar period standards.<br/><br/>What Scorcese undoubtedly understands is that Hughes continues to cast a spell over the general public not because of what he accomplished as a moviemaker, an inventor, an entrepreneur, but because he did all those things battling demons that made him both inexplicably strange and, at the same time, more recognizable as a human being with weaknesses very much like ourselves. It is this paradox that creates the kind of mystery a figure needs if he is to remain a source of fascination long after his death. In honor of that spirit, ""The Aviator"" doesn't unravel the enigma of Howard Hughes; it deepens it. And that is as it should be."
"MzKarizzma","5","3","4","24 August 2005"," Milking Eccentricity
","Okay, I admit it. I watched all 170 minutes of The Aviator, although it took me two nights to do it. I liked the film enough to keep watching, but not enough to give it a rave review. Leonardo does an excellent job of portraying this larger-than-legendary man, even if he looks a bit too young for too much of the film. Cate Blanchett was, as so many have said, exquisite as the inimitable Katherine Hepburn. At several points, I got lost in the time-line of Howard Hughes' life. For example, I couldn't tell if his relationship with Hepburn lasted months or years. In the scene where he goes wacko in his screening room, I didn't know if that was days, weeks, or months, or whether he's still holed up there today. (Of course I have since learned that he is dead, but I guess that part will be covered in the sequel.) While it was useful to see how his character deteriorates into a state of verbal tics and OCD hell, I found it somewhat unbelievable that he could testify at a Congressional hearing with such clarity only days (if I got that time-line straight) after an apparent psychiatric episode. The costumes and special effects are superb, but as for the plot, I felt something was missing. Who was that milked man?"

","""The Aviator"" focuses on the brilliant and tragic life of the fascinating madman and genius, Howard Hughes, 1905-1976, (to be precise, 20 years of it, from 1927 when 22 years old Hughes was producing the film ""Hell's Angels"" until 1947 when his most famous aircraft, the Hercules was completed). The film is as amazing and dark as the man who called himself with pride, ""Howard Hughes, the Aviator"". Cinematography, Art Direction, and Editing were perfect in the almost 3 hours long film that never for a moment seemed too long or boring. Martin Scorsese made a spectacular and dynamic picture and Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction.<br/><br/>Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both gave great performances as the corrupted and disgusting Senator Brewster (Alda) and truly memorable Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe, Hughes' enemy and competitor (Baldwin played a delightful villain). Surprisingly for myself, I didn't like very much Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn (I usually love Blanchette in every movie I've seen her)  it seemed more like caricature but it is a matter of personal liking or not.<br/><br/>I feel that ""The Aviator"" took off the ground like a huge steel bird and took me with it to the marvelous journey. I also believe that ""The Aviator"" is much better and more interesting film than the last year's Oscar winner - but again, this is my opinion. You, of course are entitled to have yours which may be completely different from mine."
"enthusiast","4","3","4","30 May 2005"," This leaves a lot to be desired; Hepburn notwithstanding
","I presume this movie was released more or less in conjunction with the centennial of the birth of Howard Hughes; he was born on Christmas Eve 1905. This film covers, or at least tries to cover, the ""public"" period of Howard Hughes life, which is shown here as being from 1927 to 1947. That is not too far off. He did not go into seclusion the day he flew the ""Spruce Goose"" though he was well on his way by that time. Hughes was seen frequently for a few more years after wards, then by 1954 or so it became very difficult to find him. He flew a Lockhead Electra on a few occasions in 1958 in Los Angeles; making touch and go landings at the airfield on some Sunday mornings. It seemed that most people working at the airport then knew who was flying that plane, but that didn't generated enough interest to call up the press. By the early 1960s he would venture out rarely, but it was not until 1966-when he started buying up Las Vegas- that his state of seclusion became newsworthy. This movie does not attempt to show those years as the director evidently felt the viewers would already be quite familiar with that phase of Hughes' life.<br/><br/>The main problem is that what is shown has already been shown in other films; even more accurately. About a year after Hughes died the made for TV movie ""Howard the Amazing Mr. Hughes"" depicted the 1927-1947 phase of Hughes life even more realistically than this movie does EXCEPT for one area, and that area is the strength of this movie and probably the reason, other than the centennial issue, why it was made. As I mentioned before other films have already shown this part of Hughes' life in realistic detail as this part of his life was very well documented. In one area though it was NOT well documented and that was about the intimate relations between Hughes and Katherine Hepburn. It was not until her death very recently that letters and notes and other writings between them were discovered in her personal effects. This represented the last known treasure trove of Hughes writings (until his infamous missing will is found) to be discovered. That gives a look at Hughes that had not been seen before. It also shows a lot of Hepburn that is not seen very often as it is part of her life that predates Spencer Tracey. That is, I believe, one of the main reasons why this film was made; not only as a tribute to Hughes but also to Hepburn- who was adored by the movie industry in her later years. The movie also implies that the breakup between the two started Howard Hughes over the edge, but I doubt that was the case in real life. Still, the scenes with the young Hepburn and Hughes are a refreshing part of the movie and I have no doubt that Cate Blanchett shows the young Hepburn as she really was in private with Hughes.<br/><br/>Speaking of romance- One of the problems with this film is the omission of even mentioning Hughes' first marriage- to the daughter of the founder of Rice University. They were married for five years and did not divorce until the filming of Hell's Angels (shown in this movie) was well underway. Why Katherine Hepburn's first marriage is mentioned in the movie and Hughes' is not is probably something of an oversight as it causes him to appear as a playboy who simply cannot commit whereas in reality he was married three times."

","I won't deny it. I'm a huge Martin Scorsese fan and have rarely been disappointed with any choices the director has made. The Aviator met my high expectations and in many ways surpassed them. One could not ask for a more gorgeous filmed movie. Every scene is so lush in detail and color, and did I mention detail! If one ever wants to see a true biopic on old Hollywood or even a museum of knowledge about 30's and 40's pop culture, this is it. Besides the eye and sound candy is the acting caliber. The Aviator has one of the best casts this year led by Leonardo Dicaprio and Cate Blanchett. They both give wonderfully rich and absorbing performances and should make the Academy's job extra hard at crunch time. Highly recommended."

","The Aviator is a completely enthralling experience as a movie that excellently connects and communicates the ""BIG"" characteristics of its subject matter -- Howard Hughes, the Hell's Angels production, Hollywood, the emergence of aviation and the power of its technology, government, America's new obsession with stars, big business, and the destructive power of mental illness. Leonardo DiCaprio, who for years seems to have been searching for and consistently missing opportunities in which his talents are suited, is so fitting in this role. He knows ""BIG"", as a superstar following the Titanic craze, and as such is prepared for the burden required to play Howard Hughes in his heyday. The film is remarkably filmed, with such attention to details that work together to convey the ""BIG-ness"" of the story -- even down to the energetic performances of the singers in the lounge Hughes frequents. The musical score is a terrific partner in this effort as well. Alan Alda, now far enough away from his M.A.S.H. days, is believable in his role as the dirty Senator. Kate Blanchette, while off to a rough start as Katherine Hepburn (has an initial vibe of a caricature), finds her pace as the movie progresses and is able to deliver the duties of presenting Miss Hepburn as the last normal thing in Mr. Hughes' life. There is tremendous fun and excitement in this movie, but it never tumbles into the traps of over-doing it or cheesiness. Scorsese has crafted a wonderful cinematic experience, for those interested in a smart biographical portrayal."

The scenes of the Hollywood nightclubs and film sets in the 1920s, 30s and 40s were interesting and vividly recreated that glamorous, excting world. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job of depicting Hughes' charm, brilliance and creepiness. Cate Blanchett was wonderful as Katherine Hepburn, and Kate Beckinsale was good as Ava Gardner. The film isn't perfect. Some more information about Hughes' childhood (i..e, he was an only child, dropped out of high school, took engineering classes at Cal Tech, etc.) would have been helpful. I agree with another reviewer who said that implying that his mother caused his mental illness is unfair and inaccurate. I also agree that some of the scenes dragged on too long, especially the scenes with Katherine Hepburn. That said, it was an absorbing, well-acted and well-directed movie about a fascinating, brilliant and tragic man."

","The Aviator is amazing biopic about one of America's most famous figures, Howard Hughes, during his most exciting, innovative and formulative years in the 1920s to 1940s. During this period he was obsessively involved in first making a film and later Aviation, the biggest love of his life, where he faces opposition from a PanAm chief(Alec Baldwin) and a corrupt and power hungry Senator (Alan Alda). As well, his own Daredevil behaviour, unwavering idealism, brash decisions, and constantly growing Obessive Compulsive Disorder and Germaphobia throughout the film threaten to derail him.<br/><br/>'The film is the shortest and most captivating 170 minute film I've ever seen. The screenplay, the editing and the sheer determination of the filmmakers in capturing this exceptional man on the screen make it a wonderfully gripping experience. It excels in every department, from design and FX to Howard Shore's great score.' Martins decision to imitate two strip technicolour (blue) for half the film is also interesting and looks great. Its a period piece that actually manages to portray the period perfectly,a historical epic, biopic that doesn't forget to engage the audience with heart and humour.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Howard Hughes and while he doesn't look like Hughes (and doesn't ""age"" well, At All), he manages to portray Hughes charm, arrogance, mannerisms, obsessions, recklessness and ""madness"" almost perfectly. However he is equally matched by Cate Blanchett in her Oscar winning role as actress Katherine Hepburn. Every Actor in the film is brilliant, though some are underused such as John C.

","Hell's Angel<br/><br/>The Aviator Dir- Martin Scorsese Cast- Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin Written by- John Logan Rating- ****<br/><br/>Howard Hughes was in many ways similar to Charles Foster Kane, the enigmatic and imposing central character of Orson Welles's legendary masterpiece 'Citizen Kane'. The fact that Kane was modelled on media-mogul William Randolph Hearst is not relevant to this review. Like Kane, Howard inherited a large sum of money and found himself at a very young age, equally the richest and the loneliest man in the world. Both were visionaries who always dreamt big. Hughes even had a fascination for large breasts! Both set out after pursuits that seemed stupid and reckless to everybody but themselves. And they both always succeeded. Both amassed large fortunes and attracted media attention. And sadly, both of them didn't know when to stop! While Kane ended up as a lonely millionaire, Hughes suffered from a more terrifying descent into madness. <br/><br/>In Martin Scorsese's 'The Aviator', we are not made privy to Howard Hughes's disturbing later life. In that sense it is a rather shallow biopic. But when viewed as a movie, it is as complete as complete can get. 'The Aviator' doesn't try to delve into the life of it's lead character but rather concentrates on one chapter in his life, a ploy employed by the recent 'Finding Neverland'. But unlike 'Finding Neverland', 'The Aviator' doesn't take cinematic liberty and tamper with the facts. John Logan's screenplay introduces us to a young Howard Hughes(Leonardo DiCaprio) working on his ambitious 'Hell's Angels' which took over three years and three million dollars to make. A rank outsider, he is ridiculed by the reigning tycoons for using twenty-six cameras to perfect a shot. Hughes completes the film, then reworks it with sound, before eventually releasing it to universal acclaim. Hughes goes on a roller-coaster of popularity, popping flash bulbs, acquisition deals with TWA and talked about high-profile romances with famous leading ladies. The most significant of his dalliances is with Katharine Hepburn(Cate Blanchett). Not only do we sense a real admiration and possible love between the two, but this interlude is also the most enjoyable portion of the movie. Hughes's visit to Hepburn's family estate in Connecticut establishes as the best scene overall. The Hepburn-Hughes relationship doesn't work probably because they were too similar to each other, both equally headstrong individuals. <br/><br/>Concomitantly, obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD) begins to cast its shadow on Hughes. We witness this rich man rendered helpless in a public washroom as he awaits someone to enter so that he can leave without having to touch the doorknob which he fears is not germ-free! His bouts worsen as he begins to repeat words uncontrollably and quarantines himself in a room where he walks around naked, mumbling, and pisses into empty milk bottles. But Hughes manages to curb his eccentricities and restores himself for a congressional hearing which will determine the future of his aviation company(his mammoth plane Hercules especially) against Juan Trippe(Alec Baldwin) and his Pan-Am airways. Hughes fights it out with the wily Senator Brewster(Alan Alda) and defeats him in a battle of wits. Hughes successfully flies his Hercules, but we see his OCD still looming upon him. Scorsese and Logan refuse to take us any further. We don't get to see Hughes succumbing to his madness and dying in a hotel room, at the age of 71, with his hair grown and nails unclipped! <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is not an obvious choice to play Howard Hughes, but he essays his part brilliantly. His struggle to hide his imperfections and keep them in check is very convincing. Cate Blanchett's performance as Hepburn is one that you can't describe in words. She is simply put- amazing, and truly deserving of an Oscar. Another person deserving the statuette is Robert Richardson. His cinematography elevates the movie from a simple biopic to an intriguing character study. <br/><br/>Puritans might argue that by removing the darker facet of Hughes's life, Scorsese has tried to sanitize a fallen figure. Rather, Scorsese doesn't make any excuses for the way Howard is. Scorsese never apologized for his characters, be it 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver'. The denouement of this movie somewhat lends it a haunting feel. As Trippe says of Hughes in the movie, ""People should remember him as he was"". And Hughes was ultimately a visionary, a creator and an aviator! <br/><br/><ul><li>Abhishek Bandekar</li></ul><br/><br/>Note- 'The Aviator' is nominated in 11 categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor(Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Actor in a Supporting Role(Alan Alda) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role(Cate Blanchett).<br/><br/>Rating- ****<br/><br/>* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent<br/><br/>18th February, 2005"
"Philby-3","7","4","6","17 February 2005"," Romantic capitalism produces fine entertainment
","Marty Scorsese is a Hollywood director with a sense of history who knows how to make very watchable middlebrow commercial pictures. Here he tells the story of one of American capitalism's more romantic heroes in an entertaining and spectacular fashion while not overlooking the demons which drove him. Although this is a big budget production with some stunning aerial scenes it is essentially a character study of a true American eccentric.<br/><br/>I'm not sure many mothers would like their sons to grow up like Howard Hughes but his Mom as depicted here certainly left him with a deep fear of germs. It is a curious feature of the story that despite being obsessed by germs Howard was happy to risk infection by sleeping with countless women and to risk his life flying experimental planes with great daring and gusto. Having lost both parents by the time he was 20, Hughes inherited a prosperous medium sized business which manufactured drilling bits for the oil industry and proceeded to build a huge ramshackle empire, including a film studio, an aircraft manufacturer and TWA, once America's largest domestic and second-largest international airline. He started out by nearly going broke making the World War I aviation epic ""Hell's Angels"", got interested in aircraft design, and constructed some pretty way-out craft, including the Hercules flying boat or ""Spruce Goose"" (framed from timber, aluminium being unavailable), then the largest plane ever to fly. It seems, incidentally that all this was funded by the US taxpayer and the lil' old Hughes Tool Company of Houston, Texas, which was the only part of Hughes's empire to consistently make money.<br/><br/>And then there were the women. Wow. If ever there was a man who lived out his teenage fantasies it was Howard. He is shown here as an adroit seducer who meets his match in Katharine Hepburn, though they break up after she meets the love of her life, Spencer Tracy. One of the best scenes in the film is a lunch at the Hepburn family estate where Howard is confronted with the whole nutty Hepburn family, all of whom seem to have mastered the art of making outsiders uncomfortable. Then there is the beautiful Ava Gardner, who never seems to let Howard get too close, Jane Russell, the lady whose bra Howard famously designed for ""The Outlaw"" (who, still living, is mentioned only), and many others, some dangerously young, though it has to be said that Howard seems to have retained a mental age of 15 or so for most of his life.<br/><br/>There are many fine performances in the film. Leonardo Di Caprico is a plausible, if very edgy Howard, and actually starts to look like him in the later Senate inquiry scenes (for a moment I thought they had slotted Sam Neil into the part). Cate Blanchett, burlier than the real Kate, powers her way through the part of Katherine Hepburn, tomboy. I really enjoyed Alan Alda, almost unrecognisable from his ""Mash"" days, as one of the villains, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, President of Pan American Airlines, and the other major villain, puts in an avuncular performance which relies a lot on his infectious grin, but it does not seem out of place. On the other hand Kate Beckinsale is a bit too perfectly dressed and too much in control as Ava Gardner  perhaps Marty is suggesting her as a mother figure in contrast to Cate's tomboy sister. Ian Holm was wasted in his minor role as the Prof and Jude Law was superfluous as Errol Flynn.<br/><br/>It's a good story, though at 170 minutes the film is a bit on the long side, and I'm not going to take Scorsese to task for his historical inaccuracies. I wonder however whether the early signs of madness were so evident. Noah Dietrich, the very able executive portrayed by John C Reilly in the film was first employed by Hughes in 1925 and remained no. 2 in Hughes's empire until the late 1950s. In his 1977 memoirs, as I recall, Dietrich says Hughes really only started to fall apart in that decade, particularly after the failure of his marriage to Jean Peters, which falls outside the time frame of this picture. Scorsese for dramatic purposes has to give us a foretaste of what is to come, but it does have the effect of making Hughes seem nuttier than he actually was at the time. Still, this is all-round good entertainment which I'm sure is all Marty intended.<br/><br/>Finally, a special mention for the set designers who, it seems, managed to turn the lobby of the Southwestern University Law School into a fair representation of the fashionable 30s' nightspot, the ""Coconut Grove""."

He was especially startling when portraying the older Hughes.<br/><br/>I thought Cate Blanchett captured Katharine Hepburn pretty well. Maybe three times I heard an ever-so-slight trace of Australian accent (actually, it sounded rather southern U.S.!) that marred the New England aspect. I was kind of bothered by the portrayal of her family; I don't think they were rich and snobbish; just liberal and eccentric.<br/><br/>No one ever looked like Ava Gardner, nor could hope to, but I thought Beckinsale did a fair job of evoking her personality.<br/><br/>The costumes were stupendous, but the chronology of the music was all outta whack. The choices and the authenticity of the reproductions were great, and yet we were hearing early 1930s recordings (and renderings of music in that style--e.g., ""Happy Feet"") when it was already the mid-thirties. The mid/late thirties were skimmed with a Benny Goodman tune, and the 1940s suddenly seemed to explode on the scene without transition. Then in 1947 we hear Glenn Miller's ""Moonlight Serenade,"" a hit from many years before that was no longer in style by 1947. Nitpicky, you say? Mebbe, but would it have been that difficult to get it right?<br/><br/>I didn't know that much about Hughes, but I was aware that he didn't go into the reclusive/not-emerging-from-his-room mode until the 1950s.<br/><br/>But, hey--what biopic ever got it right? This was an entertaining movie. Well-made in many ways. Long. As Lina Lamont would say (chirpily) ""I liked it!"""

","I really think this is an exceptional film in every single way. It is very entertaining for everyone twenty plus, and covers an interesting period in American history between late twenties to end of Second World War. The general story is very interesting, Tracing Howard Hughes life with his connections in early Hollwood and his exceptional genius in aviation design. It captures an essential part of American History in a very real and interesting way - covering early Hollywood and its transition, early passenger aviation, political corruption (similiar to what we witness today!) The acting and directing is of the highest caliber. This film definitely deserves several Oscars and hopefully will get them All I can say is it is brilliant!"
"daniel_halo","1","14","31","16 December 2004"," Dos not show all the true facts
","Over all it is a good film but it does not show all the true facts about Howard Hughes. Hughes was supposedly bisexual and had an affair with Randolph Scott and Cary Grant. This is has been avoided as a plague in the film. It is sad to see that Hollywood always tries to change or hide the facts about a persons sexuality especially when it comes to homosexuality. The best example is Richard Burton's Alexander the great where he was shown to be straight as an arrow (ha, ha, what a bunch load of lies). I am not a gay activist but sincerely feel that true facts are most of the times never shown by Hollywood. Leo and Cate Blanchett have done a great job though. Despite the complete truth not shown about the legend in the film it is good and worth watching once 6/10. Talking about the Oscars, I feel that Jamie Fox deserves it over Leo for Ray. Jamie was superb as Ray. He was Ray and not Jamie Fox. I am sorry to say that at many places in the film Leo behaves like the super star Leonardo Di Caprio and not Hughes. But amongst the actresses, Blanchett rightly deserves the Oscar. She is absolutely superb as the legendary Hepburn. Her voice, mannerisms, body language, wow! guys, this is what great acting is!! Absolutely brilliant."

","I had big expectations for this movie. I really thought that it had potential with Scorsese being ""at the helm"" and all. However, it didn't look so much like a Scorsese film as one in the style of Oliver Stone - not that that is a bad thing. I just thought that Mr. Scorsese wouldn't need to copy another director's style at this stage in his career. Then again, Stone has at least one Oscar on his mantle and Scorcese has none. 'Tis Hollywood, perhaps.<br/><br/>My second problem with the film is the casting of ""Katharine Hepburn."" Sorry. While I certainly have admired Cate Blanchett's work in other films, in THE AVIATOR she comes across as a caricature of the original. Overdone. It appears that Hepburn's only attribute is (was) her teeth. And Blanchett's accent is more from somewhere in ""The South"" region than from ""Bryn Mawr"" in PA.<br/><br/>And, finally, Mr. Scorsese certainly spends a great deal of screen time SHOWING the eccentricities and idiosyncrasies of Mr. Hughes, but he never really provides us when any real insight as to WHY Mr. Hughes was the way he was. Maybe no one really knows, and that is perhaps the point the director was 'trying' to make. Or maybe the ""unusual"" bath time episode at the beginning (and flashback-ed at the end) was an attempt to offer some analysis. Well, that didn't quite work for me. How many children get bathed everyday by their parent(s) - even ones who are a tad over-zealous about germs - and then turn out to have severe emotional problems? Scarce few, I'd bet.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is the score - which, for the most part, was not original but borrowed from other composers. I realize, however, that some latitude must be given here so as to catch the essence of the period in history when the events supposedly took place and to give an authentic atmosphere. The sets were very distinguished and really did give a ""feeling of the times."" Bonus points for SET DECORATION.<br/><br/>Having said all this, I do hope that Mr. Scorsese receives an Oscar this year as recognition for his lifetime body of work - but not so much for this particular film."
"movieguy1021","7","7","13","1 January 2005"," The Aviator: 7/10
","I can't really talk about Martin Scorsese's directorial credentials, as I've only seen three of his movies: Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Aviator. All of them have the same rating-why is that? Maybe it's Scorsese's inability to keep those movies under two hours (The Aviator clocks in at about three with previews), or since those three movies dealt on real people, did Scorsese and his screenwriters get their life stories wrong? Whatever the case is, they're all good, but maybe I'm just not able to appreciate everything Scorsese does. It's been two years since Leonardo DiCaprio's last role in Catch Me If You Can. He's not what everyone made him out to be after Titanic; he's no longer just an idol of teenage girls. Instead, he's proved himself to be a fine actor, one that's perfect to play Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, Howard Hughes (DiCaprio) is working on directing a huge epic movie. We have no backstory to him, which may have caused trouble later on. There's no telling of how he got his massive fortune, but I digress. He works for three or four years on his picture Hell's Angels, making it the most expensive movie at that time. The movie follows Hughes through his his tumultuous movie career, pioneering aviation career (such as buying TWA), his relationships with Katharing Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and his insanity (spoofed brilliantly on The Simpsons, I might add). You'll also see Jude Law as Errol Flynn (in his sixth, and final, role of late 2004).<br/><br/>For its almost-three-hour runtime, The Aviator seemed to go by rather quickly. We have the great Howard Shore score, which is sometime mixed with music from the era, to create an odd-but interesting-effect. Scorsese's direction is great in some parts, but not in others. In the crash sequence, Scorsese finds ways to build up the tension (although the interior of the houses we see look quite late-1990s...), even though we know there's still at least an hour to go in the movie, yet when it comes to the tail end of the movie, when we see Hughes in all of his insane glory, we don't really see how he progressed from a mid-case OCDer to this completely delusional psycho. It's a complete transition. Although we do get a sense that Hughes is becoming more mentally unstable, it's just completely from left-field, and maybe instead of 15 minutes of showing how different he is from the Hepburn family, Scorsese could have showed what pushed him over the edge or something like that.<br/><br/>The movie looked pretty good. The cinematography was pretty good; it's probably the one Oscar that this movie is a shoo-in for. There's DiCaprio's acting, which'll be nominated, but won't win (obviously, Jamie Foxx for Ray). DiCaprio obviously studied Hughes and his mannerisms, and does a good job pulling him off, but can anyone compare him to what Hughes was really like? Acting out someone who no one remembers (personally) is kind of a cop-out for not having to do a top-notch acting job (see, Foxx didn't have it that easy for Ray Charles). Yet he still did a good job, and threw off any lingering ""King of the World"" thoughts that people had about him. Blanchett is quickly rising on my favorite actress list-this and The Life Aquatic back to back, great in both. There's John C. Reilly, who's a good actor, but whose voice is so damn recognizable it's hard to consider him a powerhouse actor. And Alec Baldwin. Remember when, in South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the Baldwins' house, and everyone was happy? They were happy because Alec Baldwin couldn't play a character named JUAN! That's like Johnny Depp playing Fat Albert. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>The Aviator is an entertaining movie. Sure, it drags for a bit, and is unnecessarily long, but it's never boring. It's by no means the year's best biopic (that goes to Ray), but it's an entertaining one.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10 Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, sexual content, nudity, language and a crash sequence."
"stu9003","7","7","13","1 January 2005"," Interesting movie that just suddenly ends...
","Interesting biographical film portraying the early, highly successful years of Howard Hughes before his problems with obsessive compulsive disorder destroyed his mind. The film does a great job of portraying Hughes passion for aviation. You get a very strong impression of his energy and ambition and how it made him so successful. One great scene is where Hughes has dinner with Katherine Hepburn's family. All parties at the table are rich with no need to work again but the contrast could not be greater between Hughes' unrelenting ambition to work and and further aviation in general and the Hepburn family's lifestyle of perpetual relaxation.<br/><br/>The problem is that the film doesn't seem to go anywhere and the ending is very unsatisfying. The film shows Hughes' rise to power, how he flouted all popular conventions of common sense and won, how he built up his business and how he positioned TWA airlines to become a world class airline. But then, just when he appears to have won in his quest to build an international airline, his personal OCD problems take hold, leaving his future in doubt. The film all of a sudden ends at this point and there's no explanation for what followed.<br/><br/>From the way the movie ends, it seems to imply that if OCD hadn't taken hold of him, Hughes would have become one of the most powerful men in the airline industry worldwide as the owner of an international class airline and as a builder and supplier of military aircraft. It almost seems to imply that his OCD is the reason the ""Spruce Goose"" never became a success. Unfortunately, it's only an implication and no real explanation is provided.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good throughout. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as Hughes and Cate Blanchett does a great Katherine Hepburn. Overall, pretty good but not quite best picture quality. 7/10"

","A lot of the critics have commented on the fact that the leads do not physically resemble the people they are portraying. A lot of critics say Leo is too baby-faced to play an adult male, that Beckinsale is not in Ava Gardner's league, that Scorsese has made his least Scorsese-like movie, and that the movie is historically incorrect in many aspects.<br/><br/>Say whatever you want, but this is a well-conceived, entertaining movie, with all principals at the top of their game.<br/><br/>I think Leo does right by Marty, and vice-versa. They seem to work well together and I don't think if Marty wanted Leo in the movie, there was no pistol to his head forcing him to cast Leo. In fact, Leo brought the movie to Marty, and there was most likely no pistol involved in that exchange either.<br/><br/>If Leo and the rest are miscast, who should have played their parts? People like to complain about things like that, but all they are doing is complaining, and not offering alternative casting suggestions.<br/><br/>Blanchett deserves the Oscar right now. In some ways, she's the heart of the movie. She can do any accent you want, and do it expertly. Why do the British actors do accents better than anyone? I saw this at the first show on December 17, and am going again the day after tomorrow. As a dedicated Leo/Marty fan, I'd feel like I was letting them down if I didn't see this at least twice more."

","You'd better take a pillow. This film is so dull it's unreal. It goes from bore to bore. Yes, we knew Howard Hughes was a recluse. So they blame it all on his mother, very Freudian. The descent into madness is very quick, the whole ""hygiene"" plot isn't very well explained at all. I was just bored almost all the time. Even the plane sequences weren't particularly inspiring. basically it's the story of a rich kid left money by his parents and he decides to use it to make films and build planes. More power to him I say. I'd have liked to have seen more of Howard's life explored instead of just concentrating on the Hollywood bit. Jane Russell and Jean Harlow (played by the stunning Gwen Stefani who really looked amazing on screen) could have been used a lot more. Leonardo Di Caprio isn't very watchable at all as Howard Hughes, i think they hired him so the woman would flock in for his nude scenes. A very very very very very very very BORING film. Go see something else."
"movieman-200","5","6","11","12 June 2005"," Over Inflated Bio Pic with Under Inflated Performances
","The Aviator (2004) is director, Martin Scorsese's send up to Hollywood's mythology in glamor during the golden thirties and glittering forties. A quick recap of Scorsese's career finds that he has delved into various time periods throughout his film canon in an attempt to make the past live again. On some occasions  as with his fifties pastiche done in snapshots for Raging Bull or Goodfellas, or in his sixties rekindling used in Casino, Scorsese is bang on, and generates a genuine flair. Other attempts, like his reconstruction of turn of the century city life, in Gangs of New York, or exploring the cultured set in The Age of Innocence have faired less than ably  perhaps hinting of a sniff of formaldehyde dabbled in sensibilities and mannerisms that are too contemporary to fit in.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" ranks somewhere between these two extremes in the director's film making prowess. Like his previous efforts to celebrate the forties in ""New York, New York"", ""The Aviator"" proves equivocally that Scorsese has trouble evoking this sort of past without adding something of a contemporary vein to it. From his recreation of Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove through his valiant attempt at recapturing the pioneering spirit that made intercontinental flying such an exciting prospect in the first place, Scorsese's master craftsmanship is once again hampered on this occasion by his casting of effeminate and prepubescent-looking Leonardo DiCaprio as the legendary Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Hughes  at least in the photographs I've seen that were taken in his youth  was studly yet, quite clearly looked every bit his age, in a way that men of his generation tended to have a more careworn façade that was both sexy and mature, much more than today's youth. DiCaprio has something of the coloring of Hughes' wanton and maniacal flair for the dramatic  at least in spots  but it gets mired in his own disbelief of acting the part; as though he suddenly awakens half way into his lines and realizes that he's just Leonardo DiCaprio and not Howard Hughes. Hence, the suspension of belief for an audience in his characterization only comes to life in fits and sparks  most often dying slowly  and rather painfully  before our very eyes.<br/><br/>But enough about DiCaprio's shortcomings. I remain at an even greater loss to explain why so many critics found Cate Blanchette's take on Katharine Hepburn the definitive evocation of this great lady. Having seen every Katharine Hepburn movie ever made - at least twice  and, owning more than a handful of her best performances for repeat viewing after seeing this film  as well as owning no less than four documentaries in which Hepburn speaks about her life, the movies, Spenc' and so on - I must reiterate for this review that Blanchette is nowhere near the stature or embodiment of Kate Hepburn any more than I could pass for Cary Grant! In both her mannerism and behavior, Blanchette presents us with a gross caricature of Hepburn, something in the subtext of a manic latex puppet.<br/><br/>The story of Hughes and his romantic goings on with Hepburn fuel the first half of Scorsese's film. In pacing and style it does come together rather nicely in spots, but there is never a sense of the characters being lived in or the places they occupy seeming as anything more than highly stylized sets. The clothes worn are not attire, but costumes that feel out of vogue with Scorsese's handling of the material. Hence, the whole affair comes across as something of a gavotte in horse's harness  an impeccably lit and beautifully photographed fake of an era, instead of a living snapshot of the world circa 1920-1949. To go any further with the plot of this film seems moot, since it isn't a very glamorous story  made even less glamorous by its two leads. Best then, to simply state that, although the film was generally applauded as Scorsese's most 'accessible work' (a comment I find rather insulting, since it has the faint echo of being talked down to or, at the very least, suggesting that Scorsese has sold out by talking down to his audience), I suspect that Academy voters were not fooled by either the film or its performances  at least not enough to give either the picture or its director statuettes. <br/><br/>Now, for the good news. Warner Home Video's widescreen transfer is reference quality. The anamorphic picture is stunning with a sumptuous color palette that absolutely jumps off the screen. There are moments when the image will almost appear three dimensional for those watching it on larger projection units. Rich, deep and solid blacks, very clean whites and some beautifully rendered night scenes  in which even extreme background detail is obvious, but never digitally harsh, leave much to recommend this film as a visual experience. The audio is 5.1 and a marvel to listen to, with even the most subtle clanging of dinner and flatware evident from various channels of one's surround sound. Extras  too many to get into in this review; the standouts being The Age of Glamour and The Role of Howard Hughes. Scorsese's commentary track for the film is also a highlight not to be missed."
"FilmOtaku","7","6","11","17 February 2005"," It may not be his best, but it's damn good
","Despite its many Oscar nominations, I hadn't heard a lot of great things about the film prior to seeing it. That is why I was very pleasantly surprised when, while watching ""The Aviator"" I was met with what I feel is a truly great film. There are so many things involving the film that could be construed as personal negatives for me: (and more about most of these later in the review) I am not a DiCaprio fan, though I do recognize his talent, I can't stand Kate Beckinsale, and frankly, a 3 hour biopic on someone like Howard Hughes is not a very compelling subject for me. What got me into the theater was that it was a Best Picture contender and ultimately, it is a Martin Scorcese film. I was recently criticized as someone who would only dislike a film by a director I appreciate and follow if it was sheer crap, basically suggesting that I am such a fan girl that I can't discern whether something is good or not, simply because I may idolize a particular director. This is categorically untrue, but a good test of this would have been ""The Aviator"". I am a Martin Scorcese fanatic, and though I have not seen his entire filmography, there are certainly some films I like better than others. ""The Aviator"" was a film that I was afraid was going to be in the ""others"" category, but more importantly, I was afraid that it was going to be nothing more than mediocre, and that Scorcese who is LONG overdue for an Oscar (one of the only things that keeps this in check is that neither Kubrick nor Hitchcock won one either) was going to finally win recognition from the Academy based on his work for this film. About an hour into the picture, however, my fears were assuaged because ""The Aviator"" is truly a great film.<br/><br/>Scorcese's direction is brilliant; he captures the spirit of the time, from the vibrant colors to the lush costumes, to the garish and (almost scary) club performers. ""The Aviator"" is as close to an epic as one can get without donning a gladiator helmet or parting the Red Sea. Scorcese messed with some special effects in ""The Aviator"", something that he hasn't played with too often. One scene in particular, where he is in a plane filming scenes for his film ""Hells Angels"" is absolutely breathtaking. The sets in ""The Aviator"" were huge, the party and premiere scenes were electrifying, and the cast (literally a cast of hundreds, if not thousands) was headlined by some good actors. DiCaprio really was fantastic as Hughes; physically, he didn't seem to embody Hughes until his later years, but I personally don't consider that to be a necessity  look at Hopkins in ""Nixon""; he looked nothing like the man, but his mannerisms spoke volumes. Particularly when DiCaprio was able to chew some scenery during scenes involving Hughes' mental breakdowns, I felt that he not only didn't overact, but he solicited a distinct air of sympathy for the character. (Except for the few people around me who found his episodes humorous, apparently.) ""The Aviator"" is headed by a great actor, and features many excellent performances by supporting actors, but the real standout for me was Cate Blanchett in the role of Katherine Hepburn. Having been a lifelong fan of Hepburn's (particularly of her early work) it took about a minute of Blanchett's performance for me exclaim, ""She's fantastic!"" Contrary to an opinion of one of my fellow theater attendees, Blanchett doesn't just mimic Hepburn, she literally becomes her. If she doesn't win the Oscar for this role (after having been so deserving for her role in ""Elizabeth"" as well) I will be shocked and dismayed.<br/><br/>Of course, there are no perfect films, and ""The Aviator"" is far from perfect. I have never been a fan of the vintage-sounding nasal voiced narrator who appears to be reading items for a news brief on the radio, and Scorcese uses this a lot in the film. By about the third use (out of about 30 uses) I was getting pretty irritated. Though I realize that this is a pretty standard technique in period pieces, it still is annoying and derivative. I also was particularly dismayed by Beckinsale's depiction of Ava Gardner. Beckinsale, who is a homogenous and mediocre (at best) actress in the first place, managed to mess up her really small role by giving Gardner a weird Hungarian sounding accent. Perhaps I am not fully schooled in Ava Gardner's history, but I don't recall her sounding like one of the brides of Dracula. If I'm wrong about Gardner, I'll be happy to retract that criticism, but the performance was still lackluster.<br/><br/>Sure, Scorcese should have won the Oscar for ""Raging Bull"". Probably for ""Goodfellas"" as well. But as easy as it is to want to give someone an Oscar based on their past offerings, it isn't fair to that person or their peers if this occurs. (It would be like if Kubrick got an Oscar for ""Eyes Wide Shut"".) Thankfully, ""The Aviator"" is deserving on its own, and if Scorcese gets the statue (finally) he will have earned it fair and square. ""The Aviator"" is a long film, but with its great pacing, it didn't seem like it. I give the film a very solid 7/10, possibly subject to change if the film holds up in the ensuing years.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","I'm all for technical excellence in my movies, but no amount of ""consumate professionalism"" can redeem this dull, dull fare. Moreover, the fact that it won the coveted BAFTA fills this writer with dismay. It's one thing blaming the praise already heaped upon this dry and soulless piece of movie-making upon the stupidities of ""Hollywood"" (cf. last year's win for the essentially ephemeral LOTR 3 and that vacuous gaudy bauble Chicago in 2003), but when the UK homeland industry movers and shakers give it the Big Gong, it really is time to panic. <br/><br/>I saw the movie last night merely to see the Dicaprio and Blanchett performances and to check out the whole thing in the light of impending awards and got less than I expected. To start with, Howard Hughes was off my radar aside from ""Howard Hughes smiling at the majorettes smoking Winston cigarettes"" line from Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (1974), and one does like to keep abreast of history. But considering the fellow had such an interesting life it was some sort of ""triumph"" of Scorsese and whoever turned in the script to present us with effortlessly one of the most boring movies I have ever paid cash to see. Though illuminated by Blanchett (and cheered enormously to see mon hero de musique, Rufus Wainwright in the early moments), the thing collapses in the last hour or so pretty much completely as a piece of drama. The lack of care in terms of narrative presentation was truly shocking, I thought. In short, what drama? Where dramatic tension? This by the end was a film dying on its arse. And then one has to contemplate its triumph over infinitely better films last night: Vera Drake is inferior to The Aviator in British judgement? I can only imagine that many of the voters were pulling for Raging Bull and Goodfellas and hadn't even seen the film they were nominally voting for: in effect, this has to have been a vote for Scorsese. <br/><br/>What an utter travesty.<br/><br/>Craig Thomas"

There were a few moments of comedy and the scenes involving the planes were very dramatic. What let this film down though was its length. I myself had not studied Howard Hughes' life but managed to predict a quite boring ending to what was a very long film.

Jude Law is about as credible as Errol Flynn as Jim Carry would be but thankfully he has only one short scene in which to be laughed off the screen.

"bzb2001","6","7","14","10 January 2005"," Scorsese no longer great, now just good
","To a certain degree, all biographical films are as successful as the audience's knowledge of the character. That has never been more true than with 'The Aviator.' I walked into Martin Scorsese's epic knowing little about the bizarre tycoon Howard Hughes, therefore I walked out reasonably satisfied. To those who have studied Hughes, I wonder if their reaction to the film will involve shrugged shoulders.<br/><br/>There is a depressing quality to 'The Aviator' that enters as baggage that has nothing to do with the film at all. I watched 'Gangs of New York' recently for the first time and disliked it entirely. Scorsese's newest work is considerably better but leaves a bitter taste still.<br/><br/>While watching Leonardo DiCaprio finely portray Hughes, I remembered Scorsese's earlier work. He is the master of presenting the anti-hero. I was reminded of the chief characters in 'Raging Bull' or 'Taxi Driver.' The success of his films, to a large degree, fall around the stories encircling his troubled stars. Look, for instance, at the backdrop of 'Goodfellas.' Everywhere the Ray Liotta character goes, he is in a perpetual state of danger. He is surrounded by friends he cannot trust and the law who wants him locked up. Most importantly, we felt it the whole time.<br/><br/>Those films were masterworks and even for what 'The Aviator' has its sights set on, as a perfect film it would not reach that grandeur. The film begins as Howard Hughes is painstakingly attempting to complete his war epic 'Hell's Angels.' At the final cost of approaching $4 million it is an irony that the amount is a mere fraction of what the actor playing Hughes normally gets per film! The meat of the picture involves Howard Hughes' relationship with actress Katharine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett. At first I feared Blanchett would create a caricature of Hepburn, but the actress is far too gifted for that. The brightest element in this film is, in fact, the quiet moments between the two. As it ends up, Blanchett's performance is the best in the film, eclipsing even DiCaprio's portrayal.<br/><br/>That the film is totally about Hughes is made obvious early on. DiCaprio not only has the energy to show the early Hughes filming 'Hell's Angels,' but he also is capable of descending his character into inevitable madness. It is a complex role for DiCaprio and he is clearly up to the task.<br/><br/>There are ambitious shots, especially those of Hughes flying his many airplanes. But like 'Gangs of New York,' much of the scenes seem ""stagey"" and enclosed. I wonder if Scorsese should abandon larger scale epics and return to personal stories.<br/><br/>Much of the scenery is beautiful and the production team did well to show the different time periods and locations. The cast is a who's who of the neo-Hollywood elite which helps us feel we are among the giants like Hughes must have felt around Hepburn, Errol Flynn and Ava Gardner. Sadly, this is not the same Scorsese. The ambition is glitzy but lacking real substance. To say it is good is fine, but to say Scorsese is now good makes me sad. *** out of ****"

","It seems to me that a great director, Martin Scorsese, after making magnificent movies like ""Taxi Driver"", ""New York New York"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Casino"", is creating disappointment lately with ""Gangs of Newyork"", ""Bringing out the dead"" and ultimately with this movie, ""The Aviator"". <br/><br/>It lacks depth in many ways. The plane crash scene is very far from reality. The only relationship of Howard Hughes that is given properly is the one with Hepburn. Ava Gardner and the others comes and goes without making sense. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is awful. I think he performed very well in ""Catch me if you can"" but Howard Hughes proves to be beyond his acting skills. <br/><br/>The first part of the movie was promising, with the shooting of ""Hell's Heroes"" and the affair between Howard Hughes and Katharine Hepburn keeping the pace up. Cate Blanchett is doing a wonderful work playing the legendary actress. <br/><br/>But after the first hour the movie turns its interest to the aviation war and Hughes as a producer and film maker disappears from the scene. Further developments and the changes in Hughes character is getting more boring with each minute. Leonardo DiCaprio is not convincing and Scorsese could not manage to pull it together properly."

","I suspect I am one of about 17 people who figured out that Martin Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson were attempting to mimic the palette of two-strip Technicolor during the first half of this film. Big deal. After the ugly visionary debacle of Gangs of New York, our 'greatest living film director' seems to have been reduced to spending 100 million dollars to score points with the film geeks. The Aviator is digital eye candy; stunningly shot, beautifully costumed, lavishly decorated, intricately edited, and nutritionally valueless. The Motion Picture Academy got it dead right: awards for all the technical categories, and a complete shut out for everything else. The Best Supporting Actress award for Cate Blanchette is the exception that proves this rule: her performance as Katherine Hepburn is an over-the-top technical marvel quite lacking in any dramatic substance whatsoever.<br/><br/>It is incomprehensible to me that a film about one of our most fascinating American legends could be this dull. As many posters to this site have pointed out, The Aviator is factually dubious; nevertheless, couldn't Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan at least have used lies that are fun? Why not adapt Charles Highham's scandalously lurid biography? That would have been a film to see, a film about an amoral colossus, at once so public and so secretive, whose enormous appetites, implacable will, and resolute daring propelled him to the peak of power and influence. Then, of course, we could witness the inevitable fall, when those same qualities turn against their bearer, leaving him shriveled, quivering, and helpless in a Mexican hotel room.<br/><br/>Instead we get Arnie Grape with money, some airplanes, and a nice suit. DiCaprio's performance is not bad; in fact, it is often rather good - it is just the wrong performance in the wrong film. He never once convinces as Howard Hughes, although, later in the film, DiCaprio sometimes looks uncannily like a young Orson Welles, circa The Stranger.<br/><br/>I doubt the resemblance is coincidental. Because, in truth, this film is not about Howard Hughes at all. It is about Welles, and Von Stroheim, and Coppola, and, yes, Martin Scorsese - Hollywood outsider visionaries who took on the establishment suits and who, in turn, were destroyed by them, because they threatened the establishment's power and prestige. It is the same story that Coppola told in his infinitely better film Tucker, The Man and His Dream. It is a consoling story for a man like Scorsese, who hasn't made an indispensable film in close to 25 years, but one that has an air of desperation about it, as if Scorsese realizes that, in his case, it just won't do. After all, no one was giving Welles or Von Stroheim $50-100 million dollar budgets during their fall from grace.<br/><br/>Look Marty, everyone knows that no one, including DePalma, can set up and shoot an intricate, lengthy, single-take tracking shot like you can. Everyone knows that your encyclopedic knowledge of film history makes Quentin Tarantino look like a wheezing punk. Everyone knows that you can get remarkable once-in-a-lifetime performances from your actors. You have nothing left to prove on these scores. So cut the sh*t. Stop wasting money on all this bloated, empty crap. For God's sake, Welles, in F for Fake, which cost peanuts, showed more insight into Howard Hughes in ten minutes than The Aviator showed in three hours. Start emulating those Italian Neo Realists whom you understand so astutely. Take a few million out of the bank, grab a couple of digital cameras, head downtown, and make something vital. I, and a lot of other people, think you still have it in you. Your strengths are intimate, not epic. Take a chance. Go for it. Be a real Hollywood outsider. Wave of the future, Marty. Wave of the future. Wave of the future..."

There are times in the movie when I felt a disjointed subplot was introduced without a true contribution to the film. The most disappointing aspect of the Aviator was the casting. Leo DiCaprio. was never convincing as Howard Hughes. His baby face never fit as a tough businessman, engineer, and film director. Perhaps the the only aspect of the film that was worse than Leo was Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. It can only be described as annoying, unbelievable and annoying. Katharine Hepburn is a great actress. This performance by Cate was shameful. Martin Scorsese was successful in creating a BIG film. Many wonderful scenes."

It not only allows you to look back at histories most historic advancements in flight, it also allows you see through the eyes of a gifted but eccentric man who revolutionized the world as we know it today. It allows us to learn from this mans message. Emotionally, this movie may not appeal to you. In fact, if you want to experience another romantic dicaprio movie this will not be another titanic. This is a movie about the struggles of business in order to achieve one's passion despite struggling with real life issues. This is not a romantic movie, nore should it be.

"Antagonisten","7","5","9","19 January 2005"," Enough for an Oscar?
","There is always a little extra excitement involved when seeing a movie that has had a lot of buzz about it before reaching Sweden. And ""The Aviator"" is such a movie. Not least because most people are wondering if this is the movie that will finally give Martin Scorsese his Oscar for best director.<br/><br/>This is the story of millionaire Howard Hughes. The man who started out with a tool company, began his film-making career with the worlds most expensive film and then went on to become a pioneer in aviation. A story about a manic and intense individual, a man of great success but also one who lived constantly on the edge. And not only is this movie about his life's work but also about his turbulent personal life and the many women he loved.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has long been a man with a distinct feel when it comes to style. And that is very noticeable here. ""The Aviator"" is a beautiful film with a lovingly created world, intense pictures and astonishing sound and music. A delight for the senses. But the movie is also well played with a huge cast of well known and talented actors in both big and small parts. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Howard Hughes, but the strongest star of the movie is still Cate Blanchett. She steals every scene she graces with her appearance.<br/><br/>The story of Howard Hughes is fascinating. Not the least because he himself was a fascinating man, but also because of all the famous people that he crossed paths with. Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Erroll Flynn Scorsese treats Howard Hughes with a certain respect, but he doesn't shy away from his less flattering sides. This also means that Scorsese steers away from making an idolized portrait and the movie feels more real, Hughes never feels like a saint.<br/><br/>So, about the Oscar. Will this be enough for the ""Best director""-Oscar? My guess is no, unfortunately I believe that Scorsese will once again fall short. That however doesn't mean that this is a bad movie. Far from it. ""The Aviator"" is well directed, well played, interesting and entertaining. A recommended viewing, I rate it 7/10."
"luckystrike6","3","5","9","18 January 2005"," Tedious and LONG.
","I love almost everything Scorsese has ever done, save this film. It's too long by almost an hour. There's an adage that a director should never put something on the screen more than once to illustrate that which has already been clearly exposed. With the help of Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese has always succeeded in maintaining incredibly prolonged sequences of punch and great verve throughout his movies, up until now. It's not clear what went wrong. Maybe Ms. Schoonmaker wasn't given an adequately free hand in this one. I'm not a DiCaprio hater, but there's such a doting absorption with the way the camera lingers on his pretty face here that it's hard to come out of this movie without being sick to death of him. What's worse, Leo's terribly miscast in the role. When trying to play the older, disheveled Hughes, he appears not so much a sloppy eccentric as simply a man-child in an over-sized suit. There are exactly three instances of levity in this film, and all of them fall completely flat. Compare this with every other Scorsese film, from Mean Streets to Gangs of New York, all of which were alleviated by brilliant, memorable moments of gallows humor, and you'll understand immediately what would happen if the director were to completely lose his ability to play with his subjects. And while it's true that Hughes had an interesting life, it all seems like a very long life when you're forced to watch his unhappy compulsions replayed compulsively, what seems eternally, and worst of all, not very originally, for hour after hour after hour (after hour after hour after hour, as he might say.) The flight sequences don't do anything for us, because we've seen it all before. All the pretty tinting to make the film look like it was shot in hand-tinted black and white can't rescue this goose. Actually, the fact that it just won a Golden Globe says more about what's happened to the Globes than it does about this film. I wish I'd gotten my money back when I left the theater. I wish I'd downloaded it; watching the progress bar would have been more exciting than the movie itself."
"anhedonia","7","5","9","15 January 2005"," Good, not great, Scorsese
","The first 10 minutes of ""The Aviator"" are more exciting and emotionally gratifying than the entirety of Martin Scorsese's previous epic, ""Gangs of New York"" (2002).<br/><br/>You gotta hand it to Scorsese. The man learns from his mistakes.<br/><br/>After casting the pretty, but talentless, Cameron Diaz in ""Gangs of New York"" and watching that turn into a wretched film - sorry, Daniel Day-Lewis' commanding performance aside, that film's positively dull - he thought better when it came to casting ""The Aviator."" Yes, he cast beautiful women in this, too. But he found beautiful women who are also incredibly talented. Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale.<br/><br/>Not that ""The Aviator"" doesn't have its attractive actress with unproven talent. Scorsese cast singer Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, but then wisely gave her just two lines of dialogue in the entire film.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" actually seems like two films. The first part deals with Howard Hughes' (Leonardo DiCaprio) obsession to make movies and with gorgeous women. The second part delves into Hughes' fight with Pan Am and Congress, and his better-known obsessive behavior - collecting and storing his urine in jars, for instance - that turned him into the world's most famous recluse.<br/><br/>The first part is interesting. The second is not.<br/><br/>After a brief, rather Oedipal prologue that foreshadows Hughes' odd behavior later, writer John Logan gets right into the Hughes' adult life. Scorsese cuts to the chase, showing us the first year of the filming of ""Hell's Angels"" (1930).<br/><br/>The entire sequence about ""Hell's Angels"" is not only fascinating but also breathtaking when Scorsese takes to the skies to show the filming of the WWI dogfights in the film. The spectacular aerial fight alone proves what a master filmmaker he is.<br/><br/>About 30 minutes into the film, we meet Katharine Hepburn, played marvelously by Australian actress Blanchett, and the film takes off. Blanchett completely dominates the screen. She captures every nuance of a young Hepburn. Her Hepburn's got spunk, attitude, charisma and you forget you're watching Blanchett. Hers is one of 2004's best performances.<br/><br/>Later, we get another pleasant surprise - young Beckinsale as screen siren Ava Gardner. After the wretched ""Van Helsing,"" it's good to see Beckinsale putting her talent to better use. She may not be physically built like Gardner, but she carries off the role with poise and panache. She's thoroughly believable as the legendary actress.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" would've benefited greatly had it concentrated more on the Hughes-Gardner relationship and less on Hughes' eccentricities.<br/><br/>In fact, it's those two women who keep the film interesting. When they leave the story, the film falls flat. The other characters are not nearly as interesting as these two women and it's to these actresses' credit that they so completely take over a film that's not about their characters.<br/><br/>There are some fine supporting performances. Alec Baldwin's turned into a good character actor and the always-brilliant Ian Holm makes it all look so easy as Professor Fitz. There's a sensationally funny bit when Hughes forces Fitz to pose as a mathematician to prove to movie censors that Jane Russell's cleavage in ""The Outlaw"" (1943) isn't all that revealing.<br/><br/>Chances are, Scorsese will win the Oscar. He deserves a nomination, but I don't know whether he deserves to win for this movie. If he does, I'm certain it would be because Oscar voters were too dumb not to reward him for directing ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""GoodFellas"" (1990).<br/><br/>My enjoyment of ""The Aviator"" boiled down to one person - Cate Blanchett. Oh, what a tremendous difference real talent makes."

He even aged well.<br/><br/>My wife didn't like it as much as I did and I suspect that's because this is a dick-flick (a movie for men!). The movie is at its best when it describes the technical breakthroughs that Hughes pioneered. Even the numerous romances were handled in a fairly brisk. manly fashion.<br/><br/>This movie is not a Hughes biography. It covers a small part of his life (the flying bit) and, even then, only part of that (up until 1947). This gives the movie an incomplete feel and leaves you wondering what happened next.<br/><br/>But, all in all, it's a good film. Entertaining and well acted.

","I saw ""The Aviator"" last night (Dec. 25, 2004), and thought it was exceptional film-making in so many ways. Scorsese captures the Hollywood scene so well, and the plot informed me of things I had never known about Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>DiCaprio carries the show admirably as the very complex Huges, with both zest and enthusiasm and also the ability to effectively capture Hughes' private demons at work. DiCaprio's performance is one of his very best, and I expect him to be nominated for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is so dead-on as Katharine Hepburn (yes, I never thought she looked anything like Hepburn, but the way she carries herself, speaks, laughs, etc. is pure Hepburn). Blanchett should be near the top of the list for consideration as Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>I also thought Alan Alda's performance as the seedy Senator out to destroy Hughes (and also on the take from Hughes' competitors), was possibly the best he's turned in on the big screen. I would not be surprised to see him nominated for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>In all, the film features top-rate cinematography, direction, sets, a compelling tale, fantastic recreation of the making of old films, and great acting. The problem is with the choice of the ending. It should not have ended the way it did. Its ending would have been effective had the movie started out, as in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", with the death and funeral of Hughes. But it did not, so I think people not familiar with the final days of his life, will be disappointed -- not with the fascinating film, but the abrupt way it ends."

He was totally unconvincing, that is if you are old enough to remember the real Hughes.<br/><br/>And Blanchett did an atrocious Hepburn.

","A technically very well made film, helped by some fine acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda, it is nevertheless is not at all perfect viewing. Whilst the film is quite a satisfactory biopic, depicting Hughes' experiences well, it never feels deep at all, even though it tackles deep issues. The film just simply does little else other than show Hughes' life, and although that was the point of the film, it feels just a bit too lacking for it to be worthy of a second viewing. At almost three hours in length it feels much too long, and with almost all the supporting characters underdeveloped, it has little other than just its flashiness to hold one's interest. For the technical credits, which are very impressive, and for Leonard DiCaprio's solid performance, the film is worth watching. However I find little to recommend it as a film for which more can be taken out of it with a second viewing."

","Martin Scorsese's biography of Howard Hughes' most productive years is distressingly impersonal and while any Scorsese is better than no Scorsese, ""The Aviator"" has the feel of a debt being repaid to Miramax for making ""Gangs Of New York"". His commitment seems so low-level that what used to be a deliciously rigorous style here seems reduced to a series of trick shots that have less to do with burnishing an impression than with going through the motions of creating something merely impressive. The only time Scorsese appears engaged is in the first third in which Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) directs the aviation picture ""Hell's Angels"" and then tussles with censors with a frenzy reminiscent of the director himself. The rest of the film evolves into a ""movie"" movie with real characters portrayed by actors who act as if they're in a movie (particularly Oscar-baiting Cate Blanchett, as Katherine Hepburn, who appears to have watched ""The Philadelphia Story"" one too many times). It takes DiCaprio almost two-thirds of the picture to discover Hughes but he finally does as he ages into a deeply troubled hermit who still can muster the courage to vanquish the foes, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (a very good Alan Alda) and Pan Am head Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), who have conspired to break him. In Hughes' later years, DiCaprio bears a definite resemblance to him, but it's also at this point that he bears a striking resemblance to the young Orson Welles, which further connects to the film's thematic links—-and, it would appear, Scorsese's way of passing the time for most of the film—-to ""Citizen Kane"": John Logan's workman, easy-solution script (he blames Hughes' mother) attempts to portray him as a rich kid whose upbringing has traumatized him into an obsessive who lives to control the lives around him; and I swear Howard Shore's score seems at times to purloin Bernard Herrmann's. All that seems to be missing is Rosebud. Entertaining and over-sized but not particularly memorable—-you get the sense it started receding from Scorsese's memory after the premiere."

It could easily have done without the part two-thirds the way through where Hughes isolates himself and seems to go mad. Perhaps that really did happen, but it was not very entertaining. It was much more entertaining to see Hughes show up the senator. It was much more entertaining to see that Hughes finally did get the Spruce Goose to fly. It was very entertaining to see that both Ava Gardner and Katherine Hepburn remained friends with Hughes in spite of their difficulties.<br/><br/>The film answered a lot of my questions about Howard Hughes, especially why the government didn't like him. Perhaps he was a little mentally disturbed, but that aspect of his life is not entertaining and that is what films are for - entertainment.<br/><br/>DeCaprio did a much better job than I expected him to do. That is much to his credit. But the really great actor in this film was Cate Blanchet. Cate Blanchet is probably the finest actress today.

(One exception perhaps was Hughes' aviation expert, they did seem to have a real relationship.) Maybe that's a fatal flaw when you set out to cover so much of the productive life of man like this.<br/><br/>I also didn't buy the idea that his mother's warnings and washings accounts for what happened to Hughes. Maybe Scorsese wanted to create a Rosebud/Citizen Kane feel, at least that's what popped into my mind. But Hughes' problems went way beyond an anal mother."

","Years ago, Tommy Lee Jones made himself famous for playing Howard Hughes in a made for TV movie called ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"". The film clocked in at over three and a half hours and was a wonderful look at the man. Now, about 25 years later, Martin Scorsese has created a new biography of the man--though the film is under three hours long--so naturally things had to be omitted. Considering how complex Hughes was, they easily could have made a mini-series out of his life--but the film STILL is very good and worth seeing despite its brevity (and 170 minutes IS brief given the subject matter). It differs from the Jones film because instead of trying to encompass all of Hughes life, it focuses much more specifically on the psychological decline of the man and really builds a wonderful sense of profound sadness in seeing this decline.<br/><br/>While Leonardo DiCaprio didn't look or sound as much like Hughes as Tommy Lee Jones did, he was quite good in this breakout role--and was nominated for Best Actor. However, the one who managed to earn an Academy Award was Cate Blanchette--who was just wonderful as Katharine Hepburn. Her voice and mannerisms were dead on--and she played the role, at times, in a hilarious fashion. Apart from these two, the other stars of the film are the cinematographers, set designers, director and CGI techs (who managed to create an AMAZING plane crash sequence that blew my mind). Overall, a film that is best seen not as a replacement for the earlier film but an enhancement--and I think seeing BOTH would be a great idea. Well made and well worth seeing.<br/><br/>By the way, isn't it kind of ironic that Alec Baldwin plays the part of a HUGE airline exec--considering Baldwin's recent relationship with some airlines!"

This goes especially for the women in his life.<br/><br/>There is a saying; never send a boy to do a man's job. This has never been more true than in the case of Leonardo Di Caprio.

After resuming, I kept looking at the clock wondering how much longer I was going to have to sit through the film. I have no problem with lengthy films, as long as the story can maintain the attention span. And, a film doesn't have to be action-packed to do that. ""Patton"" and ""Ray"" are great examples of long, biographical films that keep the audience interested.<br/><br/>Granted, I did learn a little about Mr Hughes (as most film biographies intend to do). A lot of his personal issues were presented, but nothing came of them. Most of the film built the background for the Senate Committee hearing, but that hearing itself was shown for about 15 minutes and the outcome was not known. What was the point of even bringing it up? As an aside note, I found it funny how the Maine Senator heading the committee looked a bit like Vice President Dick Cheney. Coincidence? Or did Mr Scorsese try to make another Hollywood political statement? I just couldn't wait until this film was over. But, I was surprised at the abrupt ending. One minute you are watching this guy go through another OCD attack, the next you are watching the credits. I thought ""What?

The script abandons any notion of complexity and instead drops into neutral, leaving all concerned to do their best with an acting vehicle that never once gets off the ground.<br/><br/>Scorsese is too canny a director not to know when things aren't working out, but there's real desperation here in the extended aircraft crash sequence, as blatant a case as ever there was of special effects being rushed in to enliven a movie that's lost its way as well as its pace.<br/><br/>Shame.

I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy. They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good-looking bore without a soul.<br/><br/>In a documentary on Neo-Realism, Italian Post War Cinema, Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child, a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like. The trouble with The Aviator, it looks like a storyboard. The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show, because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen. Howard Hughes is never fleshed out. At least Kinsey, a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was, but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed. There's not enough there Martin. The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib? The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one. He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt, a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version), and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes). None of these gals are fleshed out other than Hollywood publicity shrek.<br/><br/>Don't bother with this one."

","Once again Leo is totally miscast in this disappointing movie which is all style and no substance. After two hours I was left no clearer about the man Howard Hughes although I did learn a lot about planes and TWA. But my real problem is Leo who is actually a great actor but he keeps on taking roles that do not allow his talent to shine ""Catch me if you can"" being another example when his physical presence just does not match the character. He just looks like a boy, and I suspect he always will, so why cast him in roles that demand men, sorry Leo I am not questioning your manhood, just how you look. No matter how much make up or prosthetics they apply watching him trying to play Howard Hughes was frankly just lame."
"horsegoggles","4","4","7","29 June 2005"," So So
","This movie had great potential. The acting was done well enough to convince me. I don't think they missed Howard Hughes' personality by much. What let me down was the reliance on ""Special effects"" to carry so much of the films load. I was under-whelmed by the special effects. On a 27 inch TV screen, they will probably be very convincing, but on the big screen, they were a distraction rather than an enhancement. Like so many modern movies, I think they cut short on story line and put too much focus (no pun intended) on special effects. Katherine Hepburn was easily as irritating as the real Katherine Hepburn, but there was too much of Howard's love life and not enough of his technical achievements. Unless I missed it, there was no mention of him designing what has become the modern hospital bed during his ordeal in the hospital. He was definitely a disturbed individual, but he was also an inventive genius. A more vigorous presentation of the battle between genius and disturbed mind, would have made the film more interesting for me."

","The Aviator. I've always considered Leonardo DiCaprio a good actor in the right role, and Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite directors. I must admit, prior to viewing The Aviator, I knew little about Howard Hughes, except for the fact that he made Hell's Angels and had a psychotic breakdown later in his life. But anyway, I had hope for this movie. Sadly, it left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The good news first; the movie was visually amazing. Scorsese and Co. did an excellent job creating the world of Hughes through a generous combination of set pieces, costumes, and CGI effects (most of which did not look phony). There are some exciting moments in The Aviator, most of them involving airplanes (shooting Hell's Angels, crashing in Beverly Hills, etc). <br/><br/>The bad news; the film was almost completely devoid of emotional depth, character development, and structure. This makes a big difference in a film like The Aviator. This sort of thing is what puts a film like Ray or The Elephant Man on top ten lists and sets movies like The Aviator aside from the good ones. Since the film wants us to devote our three hours (believe me, it feels far longer) towards caring about Howard Hughes, it would help a little if we could learn anything from him besides the fact that he wasn't afraid to break limits and push boundaries. I mean, the latter is slightly compelling at first, but it wears thin after a bit, and I began to grow restless for something new about Howard. Leonardo DiCaprio himself is acceptable, yet seems somewhat strained compared to other roles of his. His performance often feels one layered and thin, yet in his defense, John Logan, the screenwriter, gives him very little to work with. Cate Blanchett's accent makes you jump at first, but it also loses it's vigor and becomes two dimensional. These characters are simply animated puppets who impress you upon introduction, but leave you pining for something. There is also very little introduction to Howard himself. One moment his mother is bathing him as a child, and then BAM, he's using his oil profits to finance Hell's Angels. It was structuring like this that made The Aviator feel like a moving photo album that made the audience grow restlessly impatient. I say this because the movie far outstays it's welcome. It clocks in at slightly less than three hours, but it might as well be three hundred. When the ""climax"" finally hits, we don't know if it's really the end or if we have another decade or two of Howard's life to look forward to. I remember when the credits began to roll, half a dozen people sitting around me cried out, ""WHAT?!"" <br/><br/>In short, The Aviator felt like an over-sized birthday cake that is nice to look at, but has no flavor, succulence, or zest. Best Picture of 2004? I truly hope that American entertainment has not come to that (especially when ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Sideways"", or even ""Finding Neverland"" are the contenders). I rest my case."
"sburnside","8","4","7","17 February 2005"," The Characters
","I found this movie very interesting because my family history has a lot to do with aviation. In fact, my Grandfather was good friends with Don Smith, who was the real Flight Engineer on the Spruce Gooses one and only flight. <br/><br/>I was surprised to hear from my mother who still speaks with Don that he was not contacted when they made this film. He sat in the seat where the movie showed Glen Odekirk sitting, who according to Don wasn't even on the flight that day. He would have been a good source of information, as he was assigned to the goose for more than 30 years after the flight and retired from Hughes Aircraft. <br/><br/>Instead they made things up as they saw fit to make the movie more appealing. According to Don, Howard didn't start going off the deep end until after the flight of the Goose. Which was also after the court battle he went through. Think about it, he was pretty far gone by this point in the movie to have bounced back so remarkably to stand up for himself the way he did.<br/><br/>They showed him involved with Icon Actresses that we all know and love today, but his true love during the time the movie was suppose to have taken place was an actress by the name of Jean Peters. That's not to say that he wasn't involved with Kate, Ava and others, but I guess making them the main woman in this movie made for a more successful movie, and the truth would have been too boring since most people wouldn't remember who Jean Peters was. I know I didn't! <br/><br/>When Hughes crashed the plane in real life he was knocked unconscious and was unable to get the cockpit open, but it was true that a uniformed man ran up to the burning plane and saved his life.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this film an 8 was because of the personal interest I have. Otherwise, asside from some of the air scenes, the movie was boring and very out of sequence. A true blast to the Hughes legacy."

","As I have read several hundred of the reviews I have finally seen this movie. There are many valid comments but apparently either you liked it or not and I easily see both sides of the argument. The movie from strictly a movie-making perspective is great. There are some strange inconsistencies. Kate drinks out of the same milk bottle - sometimes he shakes hands and other times he doesn't. I personally love Miss Blanchett as an actor and a woman and I felt she captured much of Miss Hepburn in voice and attitude but although I find her personally attractive Miss Hepburn was quite beautiful and it was difficult to look at Blanchett in all those 60 foot closeups.(Stefani and the girl playing Domergue also suffer in comparison of looks as does the really beautiful Kate Beckinsale). Kate Beckinsale is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood today but unfortunately she really doesn't hold a candle to the young Ava - who was basically astonishing. Kids today you just don't know what you've missed. Leo was good. No matter what anyone says he did very well with the material at hand. I just thought the film never satisfied me. It was too jumbled and the inaccuracies were disturbing. At the end of the day it is a movie I may watch again to pick up some fine points of movie making but it won't be because it was a ""great"" movie."

","went by myself today to see the ""Aviator,"" at the Falls. It was an epic film, and I enjoyed learning more of the history of Howard Hughes, and see how he built up his empire, his craziness, and the historical sweep of the movie. I also enjoyed the cinematography and the surround sound. The actual story itself was a bit of a bore, and the acting can't hold a candle to ""Ray"" or ""Million Dollar Baby."" For my money, having seen 4 of the films I would vote for Million Dollar Baby, but wouldn't be upset if Ray won, (which was my favorite before seeing Million Dollar Baby. <br/><br/>DiCaprio, to me, was DiCaprio. I couldn't make the transition to Hughes, although his make up was astounding in some scenes. I kept seeing Care Blanchette as an elfish queen in Lord of the Rings. I couldn't make the transition to Katherine Hepburn. <br/><br/>I think it is a good film to see on the big screen for its epic and historic sweep and grandeur and don't think it would have the same power on DVD."

","Although Hughes was well known in America this film perhaps assumes the international viewer has too much knowledge of Hughes' oddities and wealth. I watched it with two others who kept needing background information. The film dragged at times and both others wandered off before the ending. The film seemed to end too abruptly as if someone from the studio had said 'enough already' and Hughes' descent during the latter years of his life was ignored. Leonardo was good at times (especially the Senate hearings) which was a surprise, and he had some fabulous performances supporting him. It'll probably win Oscars but only because Hollywood all get together to agree the Emporer is wearing fine clothes. At the end I am left wanting only to go buy Hell's Angels and Scarface."
"cadfile","6","4","7","26 January 2005"," Great looking film with an only average narrative
","The Aviator is a fictionalized account of the peak years of tycoon Howard Hughes from the late 20's to late 40's.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie because I like history and learn about historical figures in the context of the times they lived in.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hughes, who inherited millions from his father's drill bit company and spent millions on making movies and fast airplanes. Hughes was also a ladies man having relationships with many of the women who worked in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I didn't buy DiCaprio as Hughes early in the film. He seemed far too young and in close ups one could see his ""soul"" patch that the actor likes to wear. It wasn't until after the horrific test crash when he gets Hughes' trademark pencil mustache that I started to see Hughes. DiCaprio even had the same kind of wrinkles Hughes had on his forehead when he was intense. That creeped me out.<br/><br/>Even with the slight flaw DiCaprio showed the range of Hughes. From driven multitasking tycoon to disturbed germophobic, his acting was great.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn, Hughes' first serious paramour. Blanchett gave an excellent performance. You could tell she spent time studying early Hepburn films and reading interviews.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale plays fiery Ava Gardner. Beckinsale had Gardner to a tee going from loving to tyrant just like the real actress.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly played Hughes business manager Noah Dietrich. Dietrich paid attention to the business side of Hughes even though the boss could care less. Reilly turns in another excellent performance.<br/><br/>The film was beautifully shot and the time period seemed authentic. I expect that from Director Martin Scorsese but the story misses the mark.<br/><br/>Some stories indicated that Scorsese made the film using different color processes to match the time periods in the movie. This is a gimmick only a film geek will love. The only thing I noticed was a dinner scene that had blue peas.<br/><br/>Some people will applaud the lack of graphic sex scenes but in this case the film really didn't sell how much of a womanizer Hughes was. They showed him focusing on a woman and sweet talking her till she swooned but there was no sex scenes or even a scene where the couple wakes up the next morning. It would also add some insight to see if Hughes' germophobia affected his sex life. For a man who would freak out seeing a spot on some else's suit how would he ever get through a night of lovemaking.<br/><br/>Then there are the scenes where Hughes, on the rebound from Hepburn, is dating a 15 year old. What?? Where did that come from?? The couple are at the local club and no one seems to notice or care. During that time people weren't open with those kind of relationships. Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin had run ins with the law over under aged lovers.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are when Hughes is multitasking. Talking to his aircraft designer about a design and in the next sentence ordering scenes cut from a movie he was making. Another great scene is the Senate hearing where Hughes is called to answer the charges he was a war profiteer. There are some great quotes that can apply to our current defense contracting issues. Alex Baldwin, as Juan Tripp, Hughes' airline rival, and Alan Alda as Tripp's paid Senator Brewster were equally slimy as the villains.<br/><br/>The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes and the first half seems to focus on Hughes relationship with Hepburn. I am not sure she deserved as much focus as she got.<br/><br/>The plane crash sequence went on far too long for what it delivered. Yes, it was needed because it was defining moment for Hughes. He lived with the health issues from the crash for the rest of his life, but the special effect shot just wasn't need to run as long as it did.<br/><br/>One special effects shot I did love was filming the climax to the movie ""Hell's Angels"". It was obviously a computer shot but was breath taking none the less.<br/><br/>Overall I thought Scorsese channeled Hughes the director too much. There was much that could be trimmed downed or dropped and still tell a good story. What is on the screen is fine but it just misses being a great film.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The Aviator is a great film that does two things. Gives Leonardo DeCaprio his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape and becomes Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas.<br/><br/>DeCaprio puts on a fine performance as Howard Hughes and is well deserved of any awards he may get for this film. He molds himself into this role to the point where you forget that your watching Luke from Growing Pains on the big screen. He plays Hughes with a sentimental touch that we feel bad for any unfortunate events that happens to him. Hughes was an over achiever sometimes cocky in the way he had done things. But it was his cockiness that got him where he was. And his money. The film shows the mental problems that Hughes had to deal with including his OCD and his longing for someone to love and take care of him.<br/><br/>Scorsese does a great job putting this film together. He tells a great story filled with emotion and suspense while adding some comedic tones that fit right in. The film is almost 3 hours but you never notice the time go by.<br/><br/>I give this film **** out of ****"
"Alarming_Passion","9","4","7","16 January 2005"," Big Disappointment - Don't believe the hype
","This film is a big disappointment considering the first rate director, cast and crew. It is an over rated and over hyped grandstanding of a big name, Howard Hughes. What is it with great directors when they get a little too successful? They seem to throw away all the good film-making traits that made them great. The problem is the story - there isn't one. But, gee, the cinematography is so pretty, isn't it. This screenplay is pretty much a rip off of Charlie Kauffman's Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Confessions was ten times better than The Aviator. Now that is how a biography should be filmed. There is no clear story in the Aviator. Of course, this is common for true stories when you want to avoid unnecessary dramatization. But, you would think a genius like Scorsese would pull it off. He does well with keeping things moving for three hours - but the story is lacking. Then again, that may be a Scorsese style. But, it doesn't work here. There was a great opportunity to play with Hughes' psychosis, much like Clooney and Kauffman did in Confessions, and Scorsese made a feeble attempt at it here. But, he gets off track and the psychosis is lost as a very small subplot - even an after thought. The result is a story line that goes all over the place and stays with nothing for very long. Well, that's my first impression, anyway. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, despite my rant here, I find this an excellent film. It is compelling. Maybe it's because we know it's based on a real person's life. There's something compelling about stories based on true events. After seeimg this film numerous times over, I added this paragraph instead of retracting my initial statement. Usiually seeing a film over and over makes you tired of seeing it. But this one grows on you. Yes, the Hollywood marketing hype played up the film, which seemed like a lot of hype itself, probably because it's about Hollywood and larger than life characters. So, I don't blame my initial disappointment on Scorsese od DiCapprio. They did a fine job of reflecting what Hughes and his world were all about. It's the reality itself that's somewhat disappointing I guess. That's the trouble with reality. It's just not dramatically focused enough."

","The Aviator is a movie that had the potential to be good...and ended up being okay; barely. DiCaprio did a decent job, but did not capitalize on the historical character he portrayed, Howard Hughes. Blanchett was totally unbelievable as Kate Hepburn. Instead of the portrayal she gave, she should have considered the strong women she played in The Missing...forget the phony accent(peripheral) and deal with Hepburn's strength (principal). Beckinsale was great as Ava Gardner.<br/><br/>The movie's tempo was like the daily ebb and flow of the tide. Even when this tempo was ""disturbed"" (fatal crash), the movie rushed to return to its daily ebb and flow. These were real dynamic people, who came across as detached and deranged (DiCapriob as Hughes), a boring, selfish,brat (Blanchett as Hepburn), are the eye of the storm (Beckinsale as Gardner).<br/><br/>Very disappointing considering the talent in and behind this film."

","I concur with many of the other user comments: this film could have been so much better. The actors are astounding; they make you believe they are the character just as actors are supposed to. Leonardo, Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda give stand-out performances. Cate, as Katherine Hepburn, actually made me forget it was a role she was playing. Leonardo, in a very nuanced performance, was in nearly every scene; quite a task for a performer. He carries the film without getting tedious with his performance. It's the subject matter as presented I have fault with. I didn't care about Howard and holding the camera on his compulsive traits did not make me care about him more. The things I did care about (the drive of life for Howard and the people around him in the 1930s) were sort of glossed over. Martin Scorsese: I expected so much more from you!!"

","""The Aviator"" is an engaging drama which may be the best film of 2004. Then again, 2004 was a rather lackluster year at the movies. Like most viewers, I am not informed in detail about the actual life of Howard Hughes, so I cannot say how revisionist ""The Aviator"" is. The strengths of the film are the excellent acting roles by the leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett, vivid period sets, seamless special effects and an interesting story to tell. Howard Hughes is portrayed as a complex larger-than-life character with bizarre instability offsetting his genius. In itself, the movie is a captivating walk through a portion of his life. But that is also its weakness. Without a distinct starting point or ending, the story lacks a sense of purpose. Sure, it is fine to watch, but after all is said, so what? ""The Aviator"" might win Oscars, but it certainly will not become a cultural phenomenon like ""Titanic"" did. On that note, ""The Aviator"" also lacks a memorable soundtrack. Probably about as fine a depiction of Howard Hughes as one could ask for. But ultimately somewhat hollow. 8/10"
"ignacio-mig14","2","5","10","22 August 2012"," Incoherent. Long. Boring. Real Howard Hughes sure was way more interesting.
","This Howard Hughes biopic by Scorsese makes no sense at all, and the worst thing is that it lasts for 3 hours. First, the cause of a serious mental disorder like OCD is supposed to be... a soap bath by Hughes' mother when he was a kid. Shocking! Now, am I supposed to cry or feel sorry for him? Maybe I would, but if that's the reason Scorsese wants me to trust, I'd rather laugh. And the bathroom scene? Right, he couldn't touch a simple towel or a door handle, even burns all his clothes, but he has no problem touching woman after woman. Bravo, Marty, germs are way worst than a venereal disease!! HOW COULD I NOT SEE THAT!? And then we go on his love affairs for like an hour and a half, mixed with technical aviation data I couldn't care less about, idem political issues, and DiCaprio staring nastily at a bunch of pieces of meat. Back to romance, Blanchett's portrayal of Katharine Hepburn is laughable. The only thing she could possibly have in common with Kate is her name, and even that's fake. To make things worst, she disappears in the middle of the thing and nobody seems to care. On the other hand, Kathrin Beckinsale is passable as Ava Gardner, but I really couldn't care less for her storyline, and the ""easy woman that can't be bought"" (Excuse me?) treatment Scorsese gives to her makes me hate this movie even more. Honestly, I didn't finish watching this, and I don't even care about how it ends or if it ends greatly or not. I'd rather read a book about Hughes to get some reliable information about his life. The only good thing about this is the music, and the recreation of the 30-40's America. Just for that, 4/10."

Almost 3 hours long, and not even 20 minutes of it is worth watching.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be any attempt to make Howard Hughes even interesting. Nor any of the other characters as a matter of fact. Most of major ones goes by as ""who the heck are they?"" all throughout the movie. Not even the great talents of Alan Alda nor Alec Baldwin could have saved this movie.<br/><br/>Instead of showing the struggles, the loves, and the eccentricities of Howard Hughes, it just shows him as a pointless nut-ball. Nothing more than a historical footnote. And that he is portrayed just as apathetic, if not just as pathetic, as Alan Alda's character.<br/><br/>Weak characters, poor story line, impotent action. In fact the crash sequence mentioned by the MPAA uses more sophisticated special effects than what was used on Star Trek Generations or Nemesis, and whose budget was more than the 2 movies Star Trek movies combined. But in every way the Aviator's crash sequence was inferior to either one of those 2 crashes.<br/><br/>If this movie were to even be nominated for any awards, make it a Rasberry award for worst picture."
"fwmurnau","5","5","10","1 August 2005"," Episodic bio-pic never really adds up
","Over 2000 years ago Aristotle observed that a selection of true incidents from someone's life doesn't necessarily add up to an effective story. THE AVIATOR proves Aristotle's point.<br/><br/>Here's a movie that takes a lot of really interesting people and makes them -- not very interesting. The weakness is mainly the superficial script, which covers Hughes the aviation pioneer (much of this is quite exciting), Hughes the Hollywood producer (this is sketchy and disjointed), Hughes the womanizer (sketchy and uninvolving), and Hughes the obsessive-compulsive eccentric -- but never quite succeeds in pulling all these elements into a persuasive whole.<br/><br/>At the end of this very, very long film, I didn't really *feel* anything about Hughes, either positive or negative. He seems as cold and remote at the end as at the beginning and the last hour drags.<br/><br/>What Scorcese needed was a screenplay that would make us care about Hughes -- either love him or hate him -- the way CITIZEN KANE does. But THE AVIATOR is no KANE. It tries to cover too much, and you never really know why some things were included and others omitted; the result is the incidents covered seem shallow, obvious, and quickly glossed-over.<br/><br/>Still, there are a number of excellent scenes in the film. My favorite is Hughes' visit to Katherine Hepburn's family, where her relations -- as headstrong and self-involved as she is -- treat him with hilarious rudeness.<br/><br/>I should confess I have a problem with DiCaprio: I have trouble accepting him as a grown-up. He always seems to me like a 14 year-old boy playing an adult in a junior High School play. He's a pretty good actor; he applies himself and he's quite talented. I don't know why that boyish thing bothers me, just as it did in TITANIC, where Kate Winslett seemed more like his aunt than his lover.<br/><br/>Even Scorcese's period mise en scene fails to persuade. The sets and costumes are all so colorful, so squeaky-clean, they seem made for a musical comedy rather than a serious period drama. And Scorcese makes too many obvious choices, such as the movie Hughes watches that convinces him the public now wants sound films. Of course it's THE JAZZ SINGER.<br/><br/>As in NEW YORK, NEW YORK, there's a ton of painstaking period detail, but it doesn't ring true. You don't feel you're really in the 1930s and 40s, any more than you believe Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Cate Blanchett tries a little too hard as Katherine Hepburn, though it's basically an intelligent and effective performance. Her strenuous efforts to imitate Hepburn's well-known vocal mannerisms are distracting at times.<br/><br/>So I can see why THE AVIATOR lit no fires either at the box office or at the Oscars. A huge amount of work and money went into a film that is frequently interesting, but finally not all that compelling."

","Needless to say, with Martin Scorsese scribbling his name on this picture it's granted automatically a statute of epic proportions. However I have this feeling Scorsese has taken a wrong turn, a few years ago. I didn't really like ""Gangs of New York"", but ""The Aviator"" exceeded my worst expectations. Yeah, it's that bad.<br/><br/>There are a few undebatable points of critique. The first is the movie's length. There doesn't exist any cohesion between the material and the time it takes to present it, so, at some point, it all falls apart. And the reason for this implosion is that there is practically next to not tension in the movie. It's got no grip.<br/><br/>The second is Howard Hughes' persona in the film. Now, I don't know why, but I'd call it the Kane syndrome, people keep falling for demented creeps who appear to have a vision. It is not groundbreaking that people aren't perfect and it's not that exhilarating, nor dramatic to see a stuttering man getting stuck at this one phrase, repeating it over and over again. It does not penetrate, it blinds in. And the absolute down point of the film is, paradoxically, the only real scene where it shows some guts, at Hughes's hearing. Why? Because the things he says are so stupid. Don't interpret stupid as dumb. Consider it out of context and false, trying to dramatically impose a figure upon the viewer.<br/><br/>The third reason, and let's say last because three is a magic number, is Scorsese's total lack of inspiration. He is uninspired by insisting to keep Di Caprio as his lead, when Di Caprio can simply not captivate due to the Titanic syndrome. He is uninspired in his choice of ""lirysm"", because at some points the visuals don't match the music. Shortly put, he's bland.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair to omit the few intelligent moments of screen writing - rare, but nonetheless delightful given the monotony of this whole thing. Maybe Blanchett who actually seems to be an actor can gain some appraisal from me, but not much. I don't really enjoy her. That's it.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" is like the Hercule of Hughes' in some regards. It's just too damn big and ripped off to fly."

I've never wanted to find out where a director lived so badly after seeing a bad movie so I could go to their house and demand my ten dollars back for wasting three hours of my life. Each scene was twice as long as it should have been, the acting was melodramatic and overdone, and the plot went absolutely nowhere. Leonardo DiCaprio was easily the worst possible choice for a lead--first, he looks NOTHING like Howard Hughes. Second, he doesn't age at all--putting a mustache on him didn't quite do it for me. The set design and visual aspects of it were probably its only saving grace, but that isn't nearly enough to right all the wrongs this movie has done. If I can sum up the experience in one instance, it was that when he was losing his mind in his screening room and urinating into old milk bottles two hours into it, my girlfriend and I were both praying that he would just pull out a gun and shoot himself in the head and end the misery--but it went on for another hour.

The acting was spot on, especially Cate Blancet portrayal of Katherine Hepbure.The screenplay was also very good, and didn't really need anything added to it to make it more exciting, since Howard Hughe's life was so incredible.

"HotToastyRag","1","3","5","9 December 2017"," Appalling celebrity impressions
","The Aviator is a biopic of the famous Hollywood director and producer Howard Hughes. Martin Scorsese directed the film, so naturally, his beloved Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the title role. The film was advertised ad nauseum, so much so that even movie goers who didn't want to see it felt compelled to at least rent it at some point. Everyone loves to watch movies about old Hollywood, chalk-full of celebrity impressions of legendary stars, right? From a technical standpoint, the movie was very well done. The shots are well-framed, the colors are beautifully saturated, and the sound is well-created and mixed. However, if you're at all familiar with the actors and actresses portrayed on the screen, you will be beyond disappointed. To summarize, Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale plays Ava Gardner, Jude Law plays Errol Flynn, and Gwen Stefani plays Jean Harlow.<br/><br/>Katharine Hepburn had such a distinctive way of talking that it's almost a game to imitate her, like Michael Caine's or Cary Grant's accents. Cate didn't sound anything like her, and I don't know why no one told her. In addition, she didn't look like her and she didn't even mimic the way she moved her body. Basically, she wore trousers and dyed her hair and thought the audiences would be fooled.<br/><br/>Jude Law, while a very handsome man, doesn't happen to look like Errol Flynn. His eyes are further apart on his face and neither down-tilting nor deep set, his nostrils take a different angle, the tip of his nose is shorter, his bottom lip has a bow-shape, and his eyebrows have a different arch. So why was he cast? Why didn't the casting director pick Kevin Kline, who does look like Errol Flynn and actually portrayed him in a movie nine years later? Ava Gardner's defining characteristics are the large features of her face. She has a huge mouth, large eyebrows, eyes so far apart they seem to be falling off her face, and a big skull. I've been waiting in vain for someone in Hollywood to cast Eva Mendes as Ava Gardner, because I'm sure audiences would think Ava had been reincarnated. Kate Beckinsale has a small, delicate-looking frame, and a thin face. Her eyes and eyebrows are not falling off the sides of her face, and her smile doesn't scare people with its size. I can't imagine any reason why she was cast.<br/><br/>Last, but certainly not least, we have Gwen Stefani, who was extremely excited about her film debut. She played the original bombshell, Marilyn Monroe's idol: Jean Harlow. Jean Harlow is one of my all-time favorite actresses, so I took this insult to her memory personally. We'll start with her face. Jean Harlow had close-set, deep-set eyes, a substantial nose, a cleft in her chin, an extremely small mouth, a very high forehead, and eyebrows that were stylish at the time but nowadays look clownish. Gwen Stefani, during her five minutes in the film, was not given any putty for her nose, her chin was cleft-less, her mouth was its normally large size, and her eyebrows had not been altered one millimeter in shape or position. This in itself is absurd. Next, we have body structure. Jean Harlow was very petite at 5'2"" and had a beautifully curvaceous figure. She was diminutive. Gwen Stefani, at 5'7"", is intimidating. Her shoulders are very prominent, and her athletic build is nothing like the woman she's supposed to be portraying. Finally, we have the feature that was Jean Harlow's trademark: her voice. Jean Harlow had an incredibly thick and distinctive accent, but when Gwen Stefani opened her mouth, she spoke like a breathy Valley Girl. It's appalling that she either refused to do her homework, take direction, or submit her resignation.<br/><br/>With all my criticisms, I haven't yet mentioned one word about the lead actor. Throughout the film, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays a larger-than-life figure who ends up succumbing to a debilitating case of OCD. He was nominated for an Oscar for The Aviator, and when you watch it, you will concede that it's the type of role that usually gets a nomination. In general, I'm not a big fan of his because I always feel that he's acting. Actors are supposed to convince audiences that they're not acting and that there isn't a camera, crew members, sets, lights, and modern contraptions all around them. I never feel that way when watching Leo's performances. I always feel he's trying to pull from something that isn't there, and that if you went to see him in a community theater production, you'd think he was very good but probably stretching the limits of his talent. Unless you already love Leo and everything he does, you probably won't like this movie.<br/><br/>While it didn't end up being a huge success at the box office, Hollywood couldn't get enough of it. The Aviator was nominated for eleven Oscars in 2005, taking home the gold for Costume Design, Art Direction, Cinematography, Editing, and Supporting Actress. Cate Blanchett has given some very good performances for which she should have won an Oscar; portraying an unrecognizable Katharine Hepburn isn't one of them."

","This film has so much wrong with it, where do I start. First, it's boring. That's enough. This film is a tedious, uninformative, self-aggrandizing pseudo-epic that historically inaccurately attempts to portray a portion of Howard Hughes' life.<br/><br/>The character of Kate Hepburn is gigantic in this film, unfortunately she is poorly portrayed by the great actress Cate Blanchett. Blanchett does not even approach emulating Hepburn except for maybe one or two lines. What is left is a poor attempt at an imitation.<br/><br/>Next, Leonardo DiCaprio is simply too young. He has a baby face, looks 19 and is never convincing as Hughes.<br/><br/>Kate Beckensale is the sole redeeming presence in this film as Ava Gardner. She is excellent, dynamic and a tour de force standing up to Hughes scene after scene.<br/><br/>This film deviates so much from aviation, where should I start. Starting will Hughes as a filmmaker, takes up most of the first third of the film.<br/><br/>The film never delves interesting into the economics of Hughes' reality, for example, how he had to give the banks the voting rights to his shares of TWA so he could obtain loans to buy jets to compete in the 1950's.<br/><br/>This film makes the viewer want to scream to say: end, end, please end, this is three hours of my life that I will never get back.<br/><br/>The film deals with Hughes' mental degeneration as an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. It get's boring the second time around.<br/><br/>I watched ""Dances with Wolves,"" the night after I watched this film, which was excellent in comparison."
"rerity22","5","3","5","8 March 2009"," Unfortunately a bore....
","The Aviator is a boring movie if only because Leonardo Dicaprio stole the show. Instead of Leo portraying a character in a story, he thrust his persona onto the screen and essentially killing the character in it. You are thus not watching Howard Hughes' life and drama but Leo's own rendering of it. I'll admit that he is fun to watch, but after seeing him do the same act in Titanic, catch me if you can, Departed, and another recent movie I can't remember the name, he becomes lame and uninteresting as every repetitive one-man-stand tends to be no manner how funny or charming. I was constantly searching throughout the movie to see one unusual gesture of character that is not of the Dicaprio routine. But unfortunately Leo's character was constantly there at every move and gesture, and every facial expression he made was invariably another one of those already-familiar highly-overplayed Leonardo-Dicaprio displays. Perhaps Leo should begin putting his talent into sequels and series where he will be more interesting as Leo-being-himself-all-the-time rather than Leo-trying-to-portray-another-character."

"piers-32","4","3","5","12 December 2005"," Disappointing
","This film was distinctly disappointing. Not only was it considerably too long and slow, but Leonardo di Caprio was the wrong person to play Hughes - he lacked the gravitas of a serious industrialist, and looked far too boyish to play the part. He is too reminiscent of a pretty-boy Michael J Fox in his prime - unconvincing in anything other than a light-hearted, teenage movie.<br/><br/>Also, the flying scenes were poor - in fact the planes looked distinctly superimposed, not much more effective than the special effects of 20 years ago. In terms of the wow-factor of the flying scenes, it was leagues behind Top Gun, for example.<br/><br/>Finally, in terms of character development, it was weak. Hughes' development was inconsistent and he drifted from being savvy and charismatic to being compulsive and seemingly insane, with minimal transition. By comparison to 'A Beautiful Mind', for example, the development of the lead was unconvincing, and I was left neither moved nor bothered by his state. I saw this as a missed opportunity, because what would have been really fascinating about Hughes was that he teetered on the brink of brilliance and insanity, and it would have been interesting to see how the two states manifested themselves, instead of incoherently switching between the two.<br/><br/>This film was distinctly disappointing!"
"excalibur1308","3","3","5","21 October 2005"," ""I got six turnin' n four burnin !""
","Said the pilot of a B-36 Peacemaker atomic bomber. From that reference you can guess I am as keen on Aviation as Mr Hughes was, but without the talent and the quirks?<br/><br/>I think enough film experts here have been eloquent enough about the film's shortcomings but I will however add my own.<br/><br/>""I got six turnin' n four burnin !"" Six props & four jets. <br/><br/>How much we saw of the Hughes inner soul turnin' & burnin' I am not sure? Di Caprio the boy is a good enough actor but not for this part. However much he tries he will still come across as a boy. <br/><br/>The Hughes story would be a long one in any film. I thought that Kate Blanchet was excellent as Katharine Hepburn. I doubt whether many will agree but I felt there was a 'soap opera' element to this film. More so than the soap Hughes used on his hands. He was a character of complexes and yet there must have been depth. Talent to for designing aircraft and a visionary in some areas. As pointed out by other posters it never really became apparent why ? His mother touching him in the bath as a child I think is really a superficial and even trendy piece of filming ? Hughes obviously loved aviation and he did some extraordinary things in his early days. The 'Spruce Goose' his Hercules flying boat would have been underpowered and the flying boat era had come to an end and Hughes realised this whether or not this came out in the film is a debatable point? Again as other people have pointed out why so little about the man's decline and isolation. It did take up a large portion of his time on this earth.<br/><br/>I am biased but I would have liked the film to be taken more from an aviation point of view and less about the relationships - but relationships sell films. Talking of which I have read in an aviation book that Hughes had a long term homosexual relationship with Carey Grant ! Who, what when .......er I'll read that bit again! Yes, I was surprised but the book(I have forgotten the reference)did not substantiate the claim. The author just wrote it if it was a known fact ?<br/><br/>Over-hyped with the wrong actor(don't ask me who I'd choose)Howard Hughes is as difficult subject to make a film about as he was difficult in real life."

And getting at the end, alone in the world and afraid of everything!! But nothing about that in the movie. You see just the beginning of this all. I was completely surprised and disappointed the moment the credits began to roll. Even angry at some time. For the next time Scorsese, when you're telling us a story, finish it!!!

"pierre_sand","4","3","5","10 August 2005"," Just another Hollywood movie...
","Can't see why there's been such a fuss about this movie. Considering Scorsese directed such masterpieces as Taxi Driver, it is a real disappointment. I mean, you just have to have a look at the Wikipedia article to see what an exceptional character Hughes was, and Di Caprio certainly wasn't the guy to play the part. His acting is not particularly bad, it is just awfully boringly obvious. No depth, no complexity, no ambiguity. He looks angry when he has to be angry, sound megalomaniac when he has to be megalomaniac... nothing more. Besides, Hughes was certainly a ladies'man, but one can't say that the affairs with Kate Hepburn or Ava Gardner are really interesting (and, most of all, DiCaprio never seems really interested in any of them).<br/><br/>Admittedly, a biopic is a difficult exercise, and few of them are what you may call masterpieces. Certainly, this one won't change my opinion of the genre."
"robert-machin","4","3","5","31 July 2005"," a waste of gunpowder and sky....
","Maybe Scorsese should have gone for a biopic of Jean Harlow, as this has all her shallow glitter, glamour and artifice but lacks any emotional depth or substance. Might also have persuaded him to hire someone more convincing than Gwen Stefani for the role too, but I digress. Plus points: looks great, though often in a curiously indulgent way (blowing the effects budget on Hughes near-fatal crash for example). Some fine performances, notably Cate Blanchett doing a star turn as Katherine Hepburn, the only impersonation which really convinces (Kate Beckinsale manages to look like neither Ava Gardner nor Kate Beckinsale). Leonardo DiCaprio acts his socks off but to no avail - it's that chubby kid again, pretending to be Howard Hughes this time. Disbelief never suspended, but it's a casting fault, not his. Big negatives: it's so damn boring. It seems to go on for ever. It's very old fashioned, being more concerned with chronology and events than really putting work into the connecting themes. Had Scorsese had concentrated on one relationship - maybe the Hughes/ Hepburn thing, which had some really fine, delicate moments - and built a smaller film around that - maybe with a grown-up playing Hughes - it could have been way better, but I guess he's not that kind of director. I kept thinking of that Jonathan Demme movie, 'Howard and Melvin', where Jason Robards' Hughes is only on screen for a few moments yet resonates through the film (and continues to do so afterwards) in a way that diCaprio never does here. To quote Aimee Mann, and like Hughes own colossally expensive yet largely forgotten 'Hell's Angels', what a waste of gunpowder and sky...."
"policy134","5","3","5","30 July 2005"," Perfect example of style over substance, a rare detour for Martin Scorsese.
","Nobody can deny that Howard Hughes had a tremendous impact, not just on America but over the whole world and to film a biopic of him could never be boring. Another matter is to watch it and I must say that even though the movie does have stunning sequences and you can tell that everything in the flying sequences was well researched, it does leave you rather unfulfilled at the end. The trouble begins, as it usually does with the performances of the actors. Leonardo DiCaprio does well in the opening sequences and in one particular scene (the premiere of Hell's Angels) he captures just about every aspect of his character which unfortunately will be overemphasized through the rest of the movie. Like another of Scorsese's favorites, De Niro, he is pretty much let loose to bring out every emotion that he has in order to make the character a human being, rather than a stereotype.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are not so lucky and I must say that even though Cate Blanchett is very good indeed as Katherine Hepburn, she hardly deserved the Oscar for her performance here. Her one great moment is when she and Dicaprio visits her family and they play a game of one-up-man-ship but that is more a collaborative effort.<br/><br/>Another supporting actor nominee, Alan Alda, is serviceable as the slimy senator on the take from Alec Baldwin. His scene with Dicaprio at the hotel lunch meeting is some of the best acting he has ever done, despite the fact that it is rather superfluous because it is merely a set up for the big Senate hearing. The third actor worth mentioning is John C. Reilly who is in nearly every major American film today. Here he gets to play a normal character for once but he is terribly wasted. We don't feel that he is all that important neither to Hughes or the film.<br/><br/>So to repeat what I said earlier: The story of Hughes is fascinating but like so many biopics it is not completely up to par with the real story. I think the opening caption on this film says it all: ""Based on a true story"" and not ""The full story""."

The colors were so very contrasted. anyway, it sucked. the acting wasn't that good. if I had to choose between seeing that and seeing Ray again, I would choose Ray, a million times over. The special effects were terrible. The soundtrack was too. I can't believe the way they ended it. it was the worst ending since the first cut of clerks by Kevin Smith (which re-cut is one of the best movies ever). Just because I'm a Kevin Smith Fan and I don't like the aviator doesn't mean I don't like drama. my favorite movies are dramas. Jay and Silent Bob strike back was even better than this!"

","This was supposed to be one of the greatest film of the year, and a plethora of Oscar nominations gave hope that Scorsese will make it this time. He did not, and he did not deserve it.<br/><br/>Not that this is a bad movie. Scorsese knows to tell a story, and as a docu-drama 'Aviator' is one of the best. The problem is that the film tries to be a lot more including to meet the challenge of 'Citizen Kane' - much inspired of the same character. It fails exactly where a film like 'Beatiful Mind' succeeded - in explaining the mix of genius and paranoia, of vision and eccentricity, of the business leader and frivolous entertainer of movie stars. The scene in the character childhood trying to explain the obsession of a whole life is simplistic and lacks not logic, but artistic truth.<br/><br/>Worst is the mis-casting of Leonardo di Caprio. I confess that I am no fan of his, and I believe that after sinking 'Titanic' he now crashes 'Aviator'. He cannot track the aging of the character, and he is far of the complexity of Crowe in 'Beautfiul Mind'. As a compensation we have Cate Blanchett, shining as ever in Hepburn's role.<br/><br/>Not that it's a bad film. It tells a lot about the period, about aviation and cinema, about the conflict between the South and the North in the American mentality. But is is far from any psychological depth, and does not raise to the level of expectations and of the hype."

After seeing both Finding Neverland and Ray--which were well made films with an appropriate story arc--I expected similar quality in The Aviator. Boy, was I disappointed.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes certainly led an interesting life. But by failing to focus upon a particular area of his life, this film was ultimately a meandering, bloated mess. Screenwriter Logan attempted to piece together several stories from the middle third of Hughes life into a coherent story. He failed. There was no discernible theme in this overlong, frequently dull movie. And whatever talents Scorsese may have as a director, they do not lie in storytelling.<br/><br/>On the upside, the acting was superb across the board. The film looks glorious, especially during the in-flight shots. And several of the narratives worked well enough as stand-alones--especially the Pan Am vs. TWA battle.<br/><br/>But ultimately, this movie simply does not work.

","On July 7, 1946, I was at home with my parents at 618 N. Linden Drive, Beverly Hills. I can't recall the exact time of day but it seems to have been late morning in my memory. I was eleven years old. My father and I were having a game of badminton in the back yard. Suddenly, from the East, what we thought was a Lockheed P 38 at a very low altitude passed nearly directly over our house. Moments later, there was the sound of a crash and explosion, followed by a visible pall of smoke rising into the air from Whittier Drive. The editorial comment about this event said that Hughes had crashed into 805 Linden while attempting to reach the Wilshire Country Club. There is no Wilshire Country Club....the golf course he was attempting to reach was the Los Angeles Country Club, at the time the most exclusive and expensive private golf course in Southern California. In Beverly Hills, homes on the East side of the Streets have even numbers. Those on the West Side have odd numbers. Linden Drive splits off from Whittier at the 800 block. Hughes crashed at 820 Whittier, not 805 Linden. Because there are no homes on the West side of Whittier he could not have crashed into an odd number address. My father ran to the scene and witnessed the Marine just after he had pulled Hughes from the flaming wreckage. <br/><br/>My father mentioned to me sometime in the 1940's that his receptionist at his office one day buzzed him and said, ""there is a Mr. Howard Hughes here who wants to see you"". My dad was amazed that Hughes, who he had absolutely no previous contact with, would suddenly appear, alone, informally to see him. He said he was having problems in his campaign for The Outlaw, and wondered if my dad could help him. My dad had a long history in promoting Gilmore gas for Earl Gilmore, and had done a lot of successful promotions featuring lion mascots. In The Aviator, at the very end of the premiere for Hell's Angels, the narrator refers to a leather jacketed man, named Roscoe Turner holding a lion cub named Gilmore. When I saw that I realized the answer to why Howard Hughes had sought out my father for promotional assistance. Roscoe Turner was a top of the line competitive air racer in the 1930's, and his sponsor was Gilmore. That was the link that led Hughes to my dad, and I didn't know it until I saw The Aviator. <br/><br/>I found the movie interesting and somewhat difficult to become totally engrossed in. The way it was shot and edited made me constantly aware I was watching a movie production, as opposed to real cinema where you get totally captured and focused on the experience. They had to be selective with a very complex and varied individual and the outcome was a compromise, albeit to me a very entertaining one. Hepburn and Brewster were fantastic. Hughes became more believable as he aged, with the final 10 minutes a masterpiece.<br/><br/>All in all, a 9 for sure."

Howard Hughes a flying pioneer dreamed of making big movies and big planes. The movie shows how he translated his dreams into reality. Unfortunately, he was a victim of OCD, a devastating mental disorder. Dicaprio has undoubtedly portrayed the sickness as if he himself was suffering from the same. His fear of dirt, the burning of clothes and washing of hands brings alive the devastation of the sickness and his eventual descent to madness. it also shows the courage with which combats the sickness to make a heavily budgeted movies and his fearless flying.

","So many people have already posted about the liberties this movie takes with Hughes' life that I won't waste time repeating them here. That said, I can always ignore a movie that plays fast and loose with history if there's an original point to be made. Unfortunately The Aviator doesn't have a point. After nearly three hours the film fails to demonstrate why we should ever have been interested in Hughes in the first place.<br/><br/>The Aviator's production values are indeed as lavish as the hype suggests and no one can deny Scorsese's ability to move his camera in ways that make every film-school wannabee go weak at the knees. But a slick way with a camera is meaningless if your central character is unengaging. Not only that but The Aviator's woes are compounded by a meandering narrative that lacks a unifying theme (poor Marty has never been at ease with mainstream narrative). <br/><br/>I also question the emphasis on Hughes' time in Hollywood given that those years occupied such a small proportion of Hughes' own life. In terms of the overall theme of the film it's not at all clear what point is being made as we watch Hughes make 'Hell's Angels' and romance Katie Hepburn. I have the horrible feeling that everyone involved felt that lavishly recreating the golden years of Hollywood, complete with some of its most famous names, would be a sure fire route to that coveted Best Picture statuette. For once I'm glad to see that the Academy was not so easily fooled.<br/><br/>Then there's the fatal miscasting of Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. He's a good actor but in both looks and ability he's at least a decade too young for this role. Is there really any surprise that The Aviator crashed and burned at this year's Oscars? There shouldn't be. The Aviator's technical credentials are impeccable - it looks sumptuous and sounds great - but that elusive spark capable of bringing a character memorably to life, allied to a vision that knows how to take real life and shape it into a compelling dramatic unity, all of that is absent here. The Aviator is the kind of movie you find yourself forgetting as you watch it. Truly, a 'gorgeously dressed corpse of a movie.'"

At its most nail-biting moments (few and far between), the movie seems to choke, stopping short of white-knuckled gripping effusion. It all fizzles into that dreaded bottom line of any biopic: real-life drama translates into workaday cardboard in flea-pits. Success lies in that eluding hybrid: exaggeration + verisimilitude; and that's what slips through Scorsese's fingers--the sound reality check is flaccid when he fails to capitalize on it. His tunnel-vision seems to keep him oblivious to the Hollywood staple: the SPELL is crucial in 'spellbinding' and this means tension mounting towards a climax. The Aviator soars alright, but then it runs out of fuel and the viewer, suspended in full-blown animation, takes a nasty, anticlimactic nosedive.

","After seeing this movie I have a new respect for Leonardo. I never liked anything that he did beforehand but he was great in this. After seeing million dollar baby last week I didn't think I would like another movie better. I don't like Aviator as much but the acting was well worth it. I can honestly say that Leonardo and Cate Blanchett deserve the Oscar. I came away from this movie feeling an understanding of Howard Hughes that I had never knew before and sadness for the disease that overtook him. Leonardo moved me with his stunning and very moving performance. If you want to see great acting you must see this movie."
"elitt","7","3","5","14 February 2005"," Performances and Flight Sequences soar in the Aviator, but it's a tedious ride
","Martin Scorcese's ""The Aviator"" is an extremely well made and crafted film with terric performances all around. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career and the rest of the cast is terrific as well. Cate Blanchett has Katherine Hepburn down cold and Alan Alda steals scenes when he is on screen as a seedy Maine senator. I never knew much about Howard Hughes. My only recollection of him on screen is in the film ""Melvin & Howard"". He was obviously a genius, an aviation pioneer, a difficult man to work for, a man of vision, a womanizer, and a man with many phobias and quirks that eventually would cause many of his problems. DiCaprio manages to capture all of them and he does it very well. That's the good news.<br/><br/>The film takes Hughes career starting in the mid 1920's with the filming of his film ""Hells Angels"" and goes along through the Hepburn days and ends with his feud with the American government and the Senatorial hearings when he owned TWA and fought against a monopoly with Pan Am for international flight. In between all this, we watch Hughes go from movie star to movie star, build plane after plane, and eventually crash one of them in the middle of Beverly Hills and sustain major injuries which he recovers from mighty quickly. All the aviation stuff is very interesting. It's the personal phobias that made me uncomfortable. Hughes was a germ freak almost to the point where he should be institutionalized. He also admits to Hepburn at one point of the film that he sees demons. that isn't truly explained. There are a few things that aren't explained very well, yet we get multiple scenes of his quirks and phobias that seemed to go on way too long. There is an extended scene where he locks himself in a screening room for weeks when he has a breakdown. I felt like I was going to have a breakdown he was in there so long. The film needed an edit job as I was constantly looking at my watch at about the 2 hour mark. The ending is another issue I had a problem with as I felt it could've ended 10 minutes prior than it did.<br/><br/>I'm going to recommend ""The Aviator"" because with all it's problems, it's still a good film about a guy that is about as fascinating there is. I think everyone would wish they had a little bit of Hughes'vision and drive in them. (***)"
"alexjboland","3","3","5","14 February 2005"," Mind Numbingly Boring
","This may be the worst of any Oscar nominated film I can remember. The cinematography was adequate, personally I didn't find it terribly inspiring, the sets and costumes were fine but certainly not as breathtaking as they were made out to be. The editing was crap, quite frankly- there is about an hour and a half of interesting material here, and an hour and a half of pointless drivel. Large chunks of the story could easily have been dropped. Characters appear briefly then disappear without explanation. Di Caprio's portrayal of Hughes is incomprehensible, though I suppose when portraying a madman this shouldn't be shocking.<br/><br/>Seriously, I thought this movie had no redeeming features whatsoever. Even the much vaunted performance by Kate Blanchet I found hollow and forced. If there is one movie I would warn people away from this year, it would be this."
"flipgirl38","Null","3","5","31 January 2005"," Spectacular Effects, Beautiful Sets, Fine Acting, Yet Lacks Heart
","The Aviator,helmed by legendary Martin Scorsese, had so much going for it: spectacular visual effects, wonderful costuming and set design, and extraordinary acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. And you would think that a film that has all the elements OF a great film would also have something that The Aviator unfortunately lacks: heart.<br/><br/>The film opens with Howard Hughes as a child, his mother bathing him and telling him how dangerous the world is. It then cuts to Howard Hughes in his twenties, on the set of Hell's Angels where it is immediately apparent just how powerful this young playboy's drive is. He wants absolute perfection at his craft, which is making a realistic and believable film about war and combat, which he succeeds at. His peers do not take hi seriously, however, because of his age and his somewhat childish look on things. Howard Hughes begins the film young and powerful, an by the end, has aged and started to let his infatuation for cleanliness and germs to wither him away to just an obsessive compulsive loner who locks himself in his office for months at a time.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has never been a more finer actor, taking his boyish features and completely transforming himself into Howard Hughes. Every gesture, the accent, his compulsiveness, it is amazing just how wonderful Leonardo has evolved from the pretty faced boy in Titanic to serious Hollywood actor in The Aviator. Not to mention, the chemistry he and Cate Blanchett had on screen jelled, bringing Hepburn's strong will and Hughes's dependence on that to function.<br/><br/>Cat Blanchett was, not to say the least, amazing at recreating a legendary Hollywood icon, playing the part of Kathrine Hepburn to a tee. It was quite apparent that a lot of research by Blanchett was done to perfect all of Hepburn's little mannerisms, and larger than life character. Blanchett is in much need of an Oscar for her portrayal in the film, for it is nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes were extraordinary, to watch The Aviator is a trip down memory lane for older generations and an eye opening educational venture for the younger generations. The Hollywood premieres that were recreated, the legendary actresses such as Ava Gardner, it gives a sense of longing for the golden years of Hollywood before everything became so commercialized. There are spectacular camera shots throughout the film such as the flight of the Spruce Goose, the filming of the air battles in Hell's Angels, and the spectacular plane crash in Beverly Hills. All these make for one adventurous film.<br/><br/>Yet, with all these elements going for it, The Aviator really lacks heart. Though the first half of the film, Howard Hughes is at the top of his game, and the audience is entertained, yet kept far away enough where they will not really care that Hughes is slowly letting his OCD take over his life. At a nearly three hour run time, by the end of the film when Hughes's has finally completed his decent into madness you may be fidgeting and squirming from boredom. Martin Scorsese put together the life of Howard Hughes, yet kept him emotionally far way enough from the audience that they are more an observer of Hughes than actually caring for him. And that was the biggest problem of the film. Great films have characters you deeply care for, and that is all that prevents The Aviator from being that: Greatness.<br/><br/>Come Oscar night, there is no doubt that The Aviator will walk away with some awards, that is a given. The Aviator is recommended for it's stunning recreation of old Hollywood, the pioneering of aviation, and the incredible acting by DiCaprio and Blanchett. Unfortunately, by the end, you may be fidgeting, waiting for the film to finally end.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>MJR"

","Where do I begin. While I liked the story and thought DiCaprio did a great job the film was a typical Scorsese over indulgent don't know when to cut mess.<br/><br/>The first 2 hours were pretty good up until and including the crash (great special effects). The performers in the coconut grove were a little over blown but...that's show biz. Cate Blanchette's accent was inconsistent - sometimes UP East and some moments Southern.<br/><br/>There were some huge continuity issues. The movie covers about 25 years of Howard's life yet no one aged AT ALL. Kathrine Hepburn's (Cate Blanchette) hair was the only noticeable change. The meteorologist from UCLA he hired in the beginning (Ian Holm) was exactly the same age at the end as was everyone else. When Howard was locked up in the screening room his nails got long, his hair grew below his shoulders yet his beard barely grew at all. The scene in the screening room was days too long as was the film.<br/><br/>I got to a point where I really didn't care about any of these people. I think the story is great and one that should have been told. I think it could have been told a little better.<br/><br/>I thought the costumes and sets were OUTSTANDING and the use of color to match stock footage and create a period feel really worked for me.<br/><br/>In my opinion one of the worst great movies I have seen in awhile.<br/><br/>Just my humble opinion."
"Victor Field","5","3","5","29 January 2005"," Maybe the third time Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran appear in the same movie will be the charm.
","""The Aviator"" may be directed by Martin Scorsese, written by John Logan (although I've never been a fan of ""Gladiator"" and I fell asleep watching ""Star Trek: Nemesis""... fortunately he also wrote ""Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas""), produced by Michael Mann (among others) and performed by an acclaimed cast, but its real stars are all behind the camera. It's beautifully shot (by Robert Richardson) and designed (by Dante Ferreti), and edited almost too precisely by Thelma Schoonmaker, and the Sony Pictures Imageworks visual effects manage to make the flight scenes convincing (something that doesn't often happen when the subject is real planes). Howard Shore's sparingly spotted score is another plus.<br/><br/>All this effort, sadly, only results in a movie that's wonderful to watch but never really particularly... well... good. The movie shows us a Howard Hughes who's a hypochondriac, an obsessive and a lover of flight, but if you knew that going in it's not likely to expand your knowledge of him or make him seem like any more of a human being, and while Leonardo DiCaprio tries hard it's not until well into the movie before he comes across like Hughes and less like someone impersonating Hughes. But he's not as much of a drawback as Cate Blanchett (who's indescribably annoying as Katharine Hepburn), although Alan Alda does a much better job as his senatorial nemesis, and indeed it's decently acted overall.<br/><br/>This hollow core of the movie makes it a lot better as an exercise in appreciating technical expertise and impressive visuals than as something that makes you feel and enthrals you; it's got an epic length, but it's only compelling in fits and starts. You come out of it feeling you might be better off reading a good book about him instead, rather than WANTING to read more about him (there is a difference). ""The Aviator"" reminds you that Martin Scorsese, for all his impressive credentials, was a willing participant in ""Shark Tale."" But it's a vast improvement over ""Van Helsing,"" the last time Kate Beckinsale (fine as Ava Gardner) and Josie Maran were in the same movie. Of course, most things would be."

","For most of this movie I kept trying to figure out what it was about the story that made it worth being told. Was it just that this was a powerful figure of American history? Was it his celebrity status or the fact that he was bound up in other famous peoples' lives? These are somewhat obvious questions, I know, but the fact that I couldn't justify making this movie to myself made me wonder why anybody else would think it was.<br/><br/>Given the array of historical figures that could merit having a ""biopic"" made about them, why an American industrialist who seems to have contributed little to this country besides underwhelming motion pictures and better airplanes? Why not people who contributed the cultural and moral advancement of society?

","I can often judge a movie by how often I look at my watch. This was a ""4 plusser"". The first time was only an hour into it; I could have sworn I'd been there for several days. The movie was filled with so many anachronisms that I lost all respect for it early on. You'd think that Hollywood would have a better sense of its own history. (Also,is it utterly impossible to find a zaftig blonde anywhere in Hollywood to play Harlowe? I think the answer in the land of bulimia is ""no"".) I found the colors garish, the dialog plodding, the pacing tortuous. And where on earth did the costume designer dig up those hats for the Ava Gardner character - from an old Kathryn Grayson musical? When the characters were attempting to discuss the technicalities of their aeronautical work they were about as convincing as junior high school kids making an adventure video. It was obvious that they were saying the words but had no idea of their meaning. Poor Ian Holm was the only one deliberately playing confused. And what was the purpose of his character other than comic relief? I suppose DiCaprio will garner awards for playing a crazy person, which seems to guarantee a performer kudos (see Rush and Jolie among others.) I think those critics who raved about this movie, which will no doubt win the Oscar for Scorsese, should wait a few months and then go see it again, this time with their eyes and ears open and some strong coffee at hand. Remember ""Titanic"", guys?"

"kykellyiii","9","4","8","6 January 2005"," a pleasant surprise
","With apparent effortlessness this film about Howard Hughes does the cleverest little trick. It becomes Howard Hughes - powerful, stylish, and bold beyond all fear of criticism. Complaints of the film's length abound. I find that astonishing. I can't believe Mr. Scorcese didn't need more of my time for what he did - I surely would have granted it. It takes a mere 166 minutes to paint a vast and somehow intimate portrait of one of the most enigmatic figures of the twentieth century. Not a simple task. To begin with, biopics are dangerous territory for any director. The charge: distill a man's life into a few cans of film. Oftentimes Biopics tend to be hollow and external linear narratives - the subject's life from birth to death. Often when this boring mistake is avoided today's directors tend to go in another equally erroneous direction. They'll hijack a man's life, boiling it down to an over-simplistic story arc to frame the film in a contrived but filmicly effective context. I point to Taylor Hackford's RAY in which Ray Charles' life is distilled to a battle with heroin brought on by guilt stemming from the death of his brother. I'm sure Ray was more than that. Or as in MONSTER the life is boiled down to what else but a love story. It is easy to recreate the events of a man's life on film, but is much harder and more interesting to recreate the man himself. Scorcese knows this and he goes after that most difficult target - the essence of the man, the core drive and spirit that made him noteworthy. In conveying this essence Scorcese does something that far too few filmmaker's will do this day. He trusts the audience, laying in almost no exposition, showing rather than telling. He lets his audience fill in the blanks, rather than boring us with information we already know too well, and for that i am grateful. Some hoped the film would dwell more heavily on the death and demise of Howard Hughes, the dirt, the rumors and the insanity. But these are the things for which the daring and irrepressible figure is now most often known, but none of us knew the man. Mr. Scorcese has done a thorough job with our introduction. Please to meet you, Mr. Hughes."
"rsyung","5","4","8","6 January 2005"," Little Howie Hughes
","I had mixed feelings as I left the theater after seeing The Aviator. What I experienced were moments of inspired film-making interspersed with rather tepid interludes illustrating the life of a man suffering from OCD who just happened to be Howard Hughes. I never really discovered what made this man tick, and if you're going to do a biopic of an historical figure like Hughes, it seems to me that to plumb the depths of someone so well-known, to discover what isn't so well-known, is the whole point. Adding to my frustration was the casting of DiCaprio himself. I just felt he was too baby-faced(or maybe baby-voiced) to convince me that here was a man who had experienced life, on the edges and otherwise. He sounded too much like a fresh-faced actor ""playing"" old, complete with faux-raspiness to his voice. Hughes was a good-looking man, but there was something dark behind his eyes and deeply cynical in his voice and manners, judging from the few film clips I've seen of the man. I just didn't feel like DiCaprio nailed it. Cate Blanchett is another matterat first, I was a trifle embarrassed by her mannered performance--actually more like mimicking--as Kate Hepburn. Did Kate Hepburn really act likeKate Hepburn, in private? Despite my considerable initial misgivings, I thought she warmed to the role and began to portray her as a person and not a caricature. Finally, I have to say that the ending did seem rather arbitrary to me. It's as if Scorcese, realizing the limitations of capturing the arc of someone with so full a life of Hughes in less than long-form (miniseries) format, decided to end it with a somewhat predictable momentthe flight of the Hercules. It's become rather formulaic for biopics now--- let's end it at the crowning achievement of our subject's life because we don't have the time or perhaps inclination to follow a life to its (sometimes bitter) end. All said though, there were moments of truly exhilarating film-making, moments I rarely experience any more, where the sheer joy of cinema creates a kind of euphoria apart from the emotions or mood conveyed on screen. The test flight of the XF-11, scored to Bach, was one. Baroque music, with its emphasis on complexity and technicality, seemed an appropriate accompaniment to a complex and sophisticated machine like an airplane which also has the means to awe and move us with beauty and power, and the scene just soared. If such scenes had been accompanied by a little more back-story, The Aviator would have been a more satisfying experience."

","The Emperor's New Clothes is a Hans Christian Anderson fable about tailors who convince everyone that only a fool wouldn't be able to see the suit they make for the Emperor. One small boy has the guts to speak out that there is no suit, the Emperor is naked. This sums up this film perfectly: A-list stars, A-list Director, A-list budget = fabulous outfit, but there's nothing there. It is a con.<br/><br/>The Problem: the actors behave as if it's a talent show to be the best impressionist, thus focus on themselves resulting in an inability to accommodate interaction with other actors. The characters are separate, exaggerated caricatures of memories. The only actors to mimic effectively and have awareness of others were Jude Law and Kate Beckinsale, who gave connected performances. Watching Di Caprio manically overtly acting a tortured soul, who was upstaged by the make-up department, was not only soullessly stupid to watch, but embarrassing for him because he thinks he is being different from his usual roles. He had not built any humanity into the previous scenes, hence there was nothing for the audience to grasp and care about when he was ill. His performance makes Russell Crowe look like a genius in Beautiful Mind and Martin Scorsese's directing makes Ron Howard look like the master of biopics. This film is a completely disjointed, arrogant, pretentious pile of meaningless images with no depth, understanding, feeling, narrative direction, believability, nor entertainment value. Knowledge and interest in aeroplane technology did not help me like this film, because it did not show any passion or insight into this subject matter! The film is so boring it hurts.<br/><br/>Question: why is this film nominated for 14 Oscars? My Rating: 1/10. The worst three hours incarcerated in a cinema ever. I was boiling with anger at being conned into watching such rubbish. Of the thousands of films I have seen (of all Nationalities and eras), this was the worst at all levels. The interesting musical score was the only reason I sometimes stayed awake.<br/><br/>Why see this film: because you are in love Leo Di Caprio and Martin Scorsese, or because you can see the Emperor's New Clothes."
"Chris Knipp","Null","5","11","20 December 2004"," Crazy about flight
","What's the point of a biopic, anyway? Is it meant to be a sort of crude cloning, like a waxworks effigy at Madame Tussaud's but with moving images? Or is it meant to delve into the secrets, show us the real man or woman behind the public mask? In the case of Howard Hughes, we already know all about the weirdness. What Martin Scorsese means to do is to show that Hughes was also a heroic figure in the history of aviation, and a playboy who had a great deal of fun. That may be a bit of a stretch: Hughes's story is full of epic foul-ups, spectacular wastes of money and time and lives to satisfy his mistaken whims, not to mention morally dubious actions; but nonetheless Scorsese's new movie, which focuses on Hughes's early, triumphant decades, is fun to watch. It soars and sparkles This is where Leonardo DiCaprio comes in. Did Scorsese just choose DiCaprio to get a big budget for his aviation epic? I don't think so. There's more logic in it than that. Yes, Leo is too young-looking and reedy-voiced, but the movie in many if not all respects works anyway, and so does DiCaprio's performance. It's fun seeing the fine clothes and high life. DiCaprio looks great all duded up: his face and body fit quite well with 20-'s-30's-40's styles, and he's equally believable as party boy and ladies' man.<br/><br/>Scorsese's version of Katherine Hepburn -- who turns out to be one of the linchpins of the movie -- isn't too far off. At least her story gibes with the way the actress herself tells it in her memoir, About Me, which explains how her ex-husband's presence and her family's snobbish, clubby ways put Hughes off, how she discovered he was hard of hearing but tried to hide it, how they were too much alike to stay paired off for more than a couple of years. Cate Blanchett as Hepburn however not only doesn't look at all like her (she isn't as sharp and stylish), any more than Leo looks like Hughes; despite her obvious mimicry of the voice, she also doesn't really deliver her lines with the clarity, the rhythm, and the panache that Hepburn unfailingly had. But hers is essential as the liveliest female presence and so very much needed in this macho story about a boy and his toys.<br/><br/>The Aviator isn't too long if you accept that it's an epic. But can you do that? It's a colorful and unique story, but beyond that it doesn't quite know what it is, a clinical case history, a piece of hero-worship, an epic, a tragedy, or a comedy, and so it self-destructs, almost, toward the end, when the fun ends and the craziness increasingly begins to take over. We can certainly be glad it wasn't cast in the form of a solemn tragedy. It could have been made a comedy throughout. Hughes's obsessive-compulsive/paranoid meltdowns are tragi-comic.<br/><br/>The aviation sequences are so amazing you wonder how they did them. One simple answer is, by spending lots of money. They must have cost as much as Hughes's extravagant projects. Again, this aspect of the movie is a bit of a whitewash, because DiCaprio makes crashing planes look heroic rather than foolhardy.<br/><br/>People have commented on the ""clever"" (actually too obvious) way breasts and clouds are connected, and how Hughes's fondling of a woman segues into his feeling of a new plane's shell for perfectly flush rivets. What's clever is how DiCaprio's face as he ""flies"" is both rapt and manic. Aviation comes to life as a higher calling, perhaps one of the great ones of the twentieth century, but technological progress as a kind of madness, a Luddite's ""I told you so."" Leonardo is not so good as a crazy man. Growing a beard only makes his face look younger. We can believe him as a wild spender. It's harder to believe him as a recluse. (He's more often seen walking around buck naked than cowering in a corner.) But whatever you say, this movie's fun. At least it is till the craziness takes over. And even then it's fun, because Hughes is seen rallying from his longest crazy spell to triumph before the Congressional committee, stomping out to general applause. And DiCaprio works because he has the power to dominate the scene. What is best about DiCaprio is his exuberance -- always -- and his boldness, and those are the aspects of Howard Hughes Scorsese is playing with.<br/><br/>All the way through Leo does that wrinkled-brow charming-eyes look Orson Welles used to do, and you think of Citizen Kane. The Aviator may not be Scorsese's Citizen Kane but it's a fascinating movie and much more successful than the ill starred and lugubrious Gangs of New York. There are numerous splendid spectacles in The Aviator and they all have a glitzy glamour about them and are perfect for the wide screen in a big Cineplex. But is this what made the Scorsese of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas great? No. He's been seduced, not by money, but by movie grandeur, and he's moved far away from his boorish New York roots. In that he somewhat resembles Zhang Yimou, who's also moved toward pure spectacle, and with even better results -- not, of course, doing the biography of a modern figure.<br/><br/>The question remains: why do directors do biopics? Is Scorsese really looking for himself in the mad failed movie director, the obsessive compulsive recluse, as Oliver Stone is said to see himself in the megalomaniac Alexander obsessed by his mother? That may be a better answer than it seems."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","3","31 March 2011"," This is the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Scorsese, the way of Sc...
","It doesn't have the look, the style, but when the movie is over, you realize this is a cinematic experience like only Marty could have provided: a huge and dazzlingly decadent celebration of the American Dream from the mature -but never cynical- perspective of a true patriot. This good American is no one else but Howard Hugues, a precocious pioneer who has everything: he's rich, he's an aviator and a real one -this is no Frank Abagnale- and he's handsome. And no one but Leonardo Di Caprio could have embodied these 'no contradictions', and made me so doubtful that such a story would inspire me I'm glad I was wrong  <br/><br/>The thing when you're a fan of Scorsese, you try to find a bit of Travis Bickle or ""Goodfellas"" in every film he made since, especially the latest ones  movies whose masterful confidence in the directing and flamboyant ambition in the story almost worked as obstacles for the Scorsesian touch. When I was watching the scene where Howard Hugues, the handsome playboy, makes Jean Harlow literally melt of desire, I totally forgot about the first scene, where he was spelling the word QUARANTINE with his mother (?), probably the origin of his obsession with cleanliness. I forgot about this scene and I thought, okay, here he comes, the handsome guy will get the pretty doll, pretty dull, isn't it? Leo would play Leo all through the film, whose only redeeming qualities would be the beautiful and convincing recreation of Hollywood's Golden Age, and the incredible characterization of Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett. Thankfully, these fears didn't last, when I realized how truly Scorsesian was our lead character, and that the success story is less due to luck, or gift, than to a sublimated obsession.<br/><br/>Obsession, this is what drives Howard Hugues, not ambition, because in a way, ambition admits the possibility of failing. But the obsession of Howard is not to fail, it's to win, it's to build the best planes and to make the best movies. Don't call it perfectionism, this word is absent from his vocabulary, for nothing can be too perfect for him. It's simple; either Howard Hugues is the craziest character ever or the most inspiring. When the movie starts growing on you, you realize he's both, and that each of these sides of his personality drives the other. Scorsesian characters have this in common; they look straight-forward to escape from that thing behind, haunting them  The source of the psychological torment, always rooted in the spirit of the character, creates either noble or despicable motives, but in both cases, everything has a point, and everything has a reason. The question is: where will this lead? To the top, or to the fall  Let's just say, that ""Aviator"" is the story of a character whose Scorsesian condition leads to the top, literally  <br/><br/>The inspirational aspect of ""The Aviator"" is how it reconciles with the idea, almost a cliché, that whatever doesn't kill you makes you strongest  and that your very flaws or so-called weaknesses shall never be hidden or repressed because they might be the key of your personal accomplishment. Your difference is your strength. The film is about the transcending craziness into an gigantic ambition, so out of proportions, that only in America, it can work it's the idea that nothing is impossible. It's almost pretentious, as if Scorsese defended the idea that only tormented men made the world, but is he wrong? Let's face it, for goodness or badness, this world has been built by men with visions  and Howard Hugues had these visions, this extra sensibility that transformed his paranoia into a prophetic capability.<br/><br/>And these obsessions, tormenting the mind of Howard Hugues: cleanliness, perfection, repeating the same sentences, were not an invitation to label him as crazy. Calling him this way is missing the point, he's not crazy, he's simply alienated by his obsession of perfection, the idea behind Howard Hugues' story is that when we want to become something, that something finally becomes us. Clean, perfect, efficient, everything must obey to a total physical and spiritual harmony and it does drive you crazy  this is the maddening yang of the successful yin. For each construction, there is a destruction, a gargantuan plane flying has cost many others to crash, for every kiss with a star, Jean, Kate, Ava or Jane, there was a rib broken, or a burnt skin. If it wasn't for all the flash, and all the distracting Hollywood's portrayal, this would probably be the deepest and most philosophical Marty's film.<br/><br/>I reckon I felt immediate empathy to Howard Hugues as soon as I got the gravity of his obsession, because I could put myself in his shoes, and I liked him, even more because I hated him first, I was jealous, it's like I wanted him to get a comeuppance for a fault he didn't commit. But this strengthened my empathy even more, and the more he got hit, the more enthusiastic I was, when I could see him hit back. Because he illustrated the struggle of the mad but inspiring visionary facet of the American dream to overcome its most perverse aspect: thirst for monopoly and financial power. It's not TWA vs. Pan Am, its two American philosophies confronting each other in a Scorsesian arena.<br/><br/>It's almost a referential film, as if Scorsese uses this character as a therapy to justify how his own obsession with a certain idea of film-making, was the key for his personal salvation, and a blessing for Cinema  I felt like feeling the spirit of the 70's Marty  and even Leo kind of reminded me of Robert De Niro at one point, in a performance that blew me away  ""The Aviator"" is one of Marty's greatest films!"
"ferdinand1932","7","2","3","5 April 2010"," Something's missing
","With a record of deep and troubled portraits: Travis Bickle and Jake la Motta, Scorsese has all the ability, and more, to deliver on a strong level about Hughes. But somehow it doesn't.<br/><br/>On the good side there is the slick and rich production, the moving camera (adapting FW Murnau), the design, the flight sequences are extraordinary, even if a little too CGI, but still exciting. The romance with Hepburn is intriguing but it goes nowhere and doesn't say much about Hughes at all. Blanchett really takes this movie over in her performance.<br/><br/>On the negative side, when the Hepburn story is over the movie drops in intensity. Hughes is a weird and ill man and unlike Scorsese's other damaged properties, the illness just removes any possible connection. Sure, as Pauline Kael said, ""Raging Bull"" was about pond life, but it had an eloquent story about America for that group of people. Here the overt illness and script are more like a boys own adventure gone wrong but it does not connect to the wider themes that Scorsese was probably targeting, as he has in other movies. At the end the resonance is not there as it was with Travis Bickle: Hughes is not like the viewer with his OCD.<br/><br/>But more difficult is the casting of DiCaprio, where he is a capable actor but his face is wrong: it's too sweet, it's too young. It's not fair, because he does a good job but it still doesn't fit the movie but DiCaprio is a key reason why it falters. Billy Wilder said casting is everything and here that maxim is true. Movies rely on faces and close ups and how audiences respond to faces, and with movie stars, the baggage they bring, how the audience feels about them and the roles they take is crucial to acceptance. In this respect DiCaprio should have passed on the role."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","3","20 October 2009"," A biography as ambitious as the man himself
","Martin Scorsese's second collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is ""The Aviator,"" a nearly three-hour biopic examining about a thirty-year window in the life of airline and movie mogul Howard Hughes, whose successes in aviation and Hollywood romances made him shine in the public eye despite the bankrupting methods and slowly growing obsessive compulsions that tore at his private life.<br/><br/>Despite the length, Scorsese uses his brilliant talents to show how compulsion began to eat away at Hughes. To be honest, Hughes' story is nothing unbelievable or inspirational. When one decides to do a biopic, it's normally because the figure is compelling in a way audiences have never seen -- but that's not Hughes. His story is not so much what he did but the manner in which he did it, so Scorsese deserves a lot of the credit for keeping ""Aviator"" a compelling biography.<br/><br/>Scorsese brings what could constitute as horror movie technique to illustrate Hughes' OCD. For one thing, OCD is not a vocal part of this film. It's never mentioned aloud except when a few characters describe Hughes as ""eccentric."" Scorsese is solely responsible for our understanding of Hughes' condition. The way hands are shown moving slowly and elegantly in the film, the way Scorsese holds on a close-up of red meat -- we get what's going on in Hughes' head.<br/><br/>The blast of light from old-time flashbulbs and the crunching of glass, the way different characters' start to speak over each other -- we easily identify with Hughes' discomfort. Some help from Robert Richardson's stunning color palettes and unusual but striking lighting effects certainly helped.<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, the ""continue to spend money to be ahead of the curve"" slogan motivating Hughes' inventing beginning with making ""Hell's Angels"" the most expensive movie ever made (at the time) highlights the difference between him and ourselves. Nobody logically would have dared to do the things Hughes did, but he had the money and the drive to do it, constantly forcing his business manager (John C. Reilly, in the movie's first scene) to take care of the technicalities and to make it work regardless of what it took. The fact that Hughes kept going despite OCD and making debilitating choices is what makes him a great biographical figure.<br/><br/>Parts of ""Aviator,"" while a big part of his life, don't seem to add to this core vision Scorsese and writer John Logan (""Gladiator,"" ""The Last Samurai"") paints of who Hughes was. His playboy persona adds another mysterious dimension to his character, but as great as Cate Blanchett (Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner) are in this film, their subplots don't fit as well considering how much else is going on. In summary, Hughes needed them as maternal figures in a way, but couldn't offer them anything substantial as far as love and affection. As interesting as that is to note, notice that it doesn't exactly influence Hughes' ceaseless drive to make the best planes in the world.<br/><br/>As Alan Alda's character Sen. Brewster enters the picture and attacks the image of Hughes that we grew accustomed to in the first chunk of the film, calling him a criminal for using military tax dollars and never having anything to show for it, we start to see Hughes' legacy. One could call Hughes a number of things, but not a liar or a crook. His flaws were in his ambition, not his core self. In 170 minutes he never once smokes a cigarette or drinks liquor -- you won't find that from a protagonist in a 1920-1947 period biopic in any other film. Coincidentally, the ambition of this film to fire off that message for its entire duration is its only real fault. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
"gordon_brennan","8","2","3","21 September 2009"," ""Howard Hughes, The Aviator""
","""The Aviator"" focuses on the brilliant and tragic life of the fascinating madman and genius, Howard Hughes, 1905-1976, (to be precise, 20 years of it, from 1927 when 22 years old Hughes was producing the film ""Hell's Angels"" until 1947 when his most famous aircraft, the Hercules was completed). The film is as amazing and dark as the man who called himself with pride, ""Howard Hughes, the Aviator"". Cinematography, Art Direction, and Editing were perfect in the almost 3 hours long film that never for a moment seemed too long or boring. Martin Scorsese made a spectacular and dynamic picture and Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both gave great performances as the corrupted and disgusting Senator Brewster (Alda) and truly memorable Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe, Hughes' enemy and competitor (Baldwin played a delightful villain). Surprisingly for myself, I didn't like very much Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Katherine Hepburn (I usually love Blanchette in every movie I've seen her) - it seemed more like caricature but it is a matter of personal liking or not. I feel that ""The Aviator"" took off the ground like a huge steel bird and took me with it to the marvelous journey. I also believe that ""The Aviator"" is much better and more interesting film than that year's Oscar winner - but this is my opinion."
"Fred_Maxwell","8","2","3","10 September 2009"," Good insight into the demons that plagued Howard Hughes
","This movie is basically three movies in one - The making of Hell's Angels, Hughes' relationship with Katherine Hepburn, and Hughes' battle with Congress over a law that could have effectively put him out of business, covering the years 1927-1947 in Howard Hughes' life. The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard. The first part of the film is actually my favorite, in part because Hughes is young and relatively free from the mental illness that plagues him later in the film, and also in part because it is just plain fun watching young Howard spend three years making ""Hell's Angels"". You have a hard time telling where his love of aviation and perfection stop and his OCD begins, and DiCaprio has the I-am-so-rich-I-can-buy-anything-I-want swagger down just right, mixed with the perfect amount of flirtatious charm and lost boy vulnerability. Hughes' hubris is balanced by his right-hand man, Noah Dietrich, solidly played by John C. Reilly, CEO of the Hughes empire for 32 years with only two vacations the entire time, and who lived to be 13 days shy of his 93rd birthday. This part of the movie has some of its most stylish sets and is the most visually appealing part of the film, in my opinion. The second part of the film, which focuses on Hughes' relationship with Katherine Hepburn, is good mainly because Cate Blanchett really steals the show as Hepburn. It is said that Blanchett watched every reel of film she could get her hands on from the 1930's that featured Hepburn, and her preparation shows. At some point you forget this actually ISN'T Hepburn you are watching. My favorite part of this section of the film is when the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met. The third part of the film is the most depressing and required the most acting talent from DiCaprio, and he did a stellar job showing Hughes descent into madness. This part of the film starts with Hughes' near-fatal aircraft accident on July 7, 1946, while piloting the experimental U.S. Army spy plane XF-11 over Los Angeles. During his convalescence, the political winds turn against him. Pan American World Airways chief Juan Trippe sought to monopolize international air travel and had influenced Maine Senator Owen Brewster to propose legislation securing Pan Am as the sole American airline allowed to fly overseas, at a time when Hughes planned TWA service to Europe with the Constellation. Brewster in turn, started a Senate investigation of Hughes claiming he had wasted huge quantities of the taxpayers' money and had yet failed to produce any planes. Just prior to the hearings, the film shows Hughes having a complete nervous collapse. He locks himself into one of his film viewing rooms, apparently for weeks, muttering to himself in one of his OCD-induced fogs. He does reclaim his sanity just in time, though, and manages to turn the Senate hearings into an attack on Brewster when he successfully exposed Brewster's dealings with Pan Am. Overall ""The Aviator"" is a visually stunning film with great performances by both DiCaprio and Blanchett. I was really pleasantly surprised by DiCaprio's performance, though. His previous outing with director Scorcese in ""Gangs of New York"" was such a bad film that I couldn't really judge DiCaprio as an actor. His parts before that basically had him playing male ""eye candy"" roles, so, again, I couldn't really judge whether or not that was all he was capable of doing. This movie, however, finally gave him the chance to either shine or fall in a good role in a quality film."

Leo is fine in the lead although he looks too young, but its Cate Blanchett playing Katharine Hepburn who steals the show. She owns the screen whenever she makes an appearance and won a richly deserved Oscar. Kate Beckinsale is miscast as Ava Gardner. The rest of the cast are fine. The film takes a sympathetic view of Hughes as it depicts him fighting to control his sanity, even as he is being questioned by the Govt. for alleged improprieties.

","Howard Hughes is one of the most remarkable persons of the last century. This is the best movie ever made about him. 9 stars from me! The only thing that disappointed me a little bit was that at some points the scenes were a bit lengthy. The director must have been aware of the danger of lengthiness because in the movie Howard is complaining about lengthiness of his own movies. Leonardo Di Caprio proves in this movie that he is one of the most complete actors ever. As handsome as he is, he isn't afraid to ""play ugly"" (like in ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"") The way Leonardo evolves during the movie from the young into the old and mad Howard is just amazing! The last point of criticism is that Howard Hughes death (at the age of 70 in a plane crash) is not in the movie. A brilliant ending scene would have been that Howard was repeating the same last words while the plane was going down in stead of how the movie ends like it ends."
"departed07","10","2","3","25 February 2008"," The way of the future is here!
","I don't know what drives Martin Scorsese to make biography pictures. Is it that he wanted to win an Academy Award before earning his first statute from The Departed? Is he really fascinated by these characters he's making about? To be honest, I don't know. But whenever I think of Martin Scorsese , I think about the techniques he uses in his movies from quick editing to fast-forward motion where I am just stunned to see how wild and brilliant Scorsese is.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" deals with the ups and downs of Howard Hughes (played wonderfully by Leonardo DiCaprio) where not only does he want to make airplanes using the money from his oil tycoon business, but manages to change history as well. He gets involved with movie stars such as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett as a marvel), Ava Gardner (the delicious Kate Beckensale), Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani, making her film debut) and many other babes including a sixteen year old. While Howard is not only being a mesmerizing playboy and showing off his airplanes, he wants to make movies as well. He makes two of the most harrowing pictures of the early 1930's from ""Hell's Angels"" and the original ""Scarface"" where not only do people consider him a wacko because of the violence, but a genius at the same time.<br/><br/>Just like every popular celebrity in town, there are a couple of enemies that want to slander and rid Hughes of any business. There's Pan-Am flight manager Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) who wants to know the secrets to Howard's new airline plan TWA. Trippe has a sneak on board by Maine republican senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) who know the tricks in making Howard suffer.<br/><br/>Throughout the film we get to see Howard's personal problems, and I'm not talking about girl issues, I'm talking about the obsessive compulsive disorder where it's one of the main sides of his downfall leaving everybody to wonder and how he'll succeed if this little disease keeps up with him. He's afraid of germs; he washes his hands more than once; he shuts his mouth tight if he can't get his words right. What a horrible feeling that must be.<br/><br/>Other characters in the film include Noah Dietrich (the gifted John C. Reilly), who is an incompetent bag of hammers that is the fool to Hughes ' King Lear. Glenn Odekirk (Matt Ross) is Hughes' flight engineer who finds Howard's behavior a little strange. Professor Fitz (Ian Holm) is hired by the eccentric engineer to find out if the wind resistance is good or not.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" may not suit everybody's expectations, but Scorsese never fails on bringing energy just like his other films. I think what made Scorsese make this movie was the fact that he was a fan of the atmosphere of the glamor of the 1930's where most of the movies he watched became his inspiration for making films.<br/><br/>And somehow he gets to go back and make his dream come true in one of the most moving biopics I've ever seen."

While I still can't afford the luxury he lived in, I too feel my accomplishments will always be in the shadows of my late parents. I would, however, like to believe I have a brighter future ahead of me than the one Huge eventually had. <br/><br/>Even though he was a pioneer in fields like cinema and aviation, Huge's mental illness never let him bask in the light of his achievements  and that, I believe, was his greatest tragedy."

Despite the fact that I often call him Decrapio, Leo really shows that he's a very capable, even (gasp) good actor. He really brings out Hughes' personality (whether this movie is an accurate portrayal of Hughes or not, I don't know nor do I care) from his start in the film business with hints of odd behavior to his aviation skills to his descent into paranoia and OCD. I daresay that this is Scorsese's best-looking film. The crash sequence is simultaneously beautiful and deeply disturbing. It gets a little artsy here and there but overall it's breathtaking. It loses points for two things. First, I never felt much sympathy for Hughes for most of the film, except for the end, where his disease overtakes him. I don't know if this is the fault of the character, the script, or the actor, but I felt an odd detachment throughout this film. The other is Cate Blanchett's role as Hepburn. It struck me as more of a parody of her than a portrayal. But this should not stop anyone from watching this film. It's not a classic, but it's still a great and memorable film."
"john_mctaggart_70","7","2","3","22 December 2006"," ""There too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes""
","And thus with the most simplistic of statements Katherine Hepburn, an Oscar rewarded though arguably over-cooked Blanchet, illustrates the inner turmoil of the films protagonist, a man whose ambition and imagination are only surpassed by his inner struggles and mental instability.<br/><br/>In a melancholy scene involving Hughes's mother planting the seeds of obsession in her son, Scorsese, from the get go set the tone for the emotional roller-coaster and ultimately tragedy that was the life of Howard Hughes. A story such as Hughes would lend itself greatly to melodrama, but Scorsese brilliance shines through in his ability to deal with characters as they were, real. Through the film Hughes, portrayed admirably by DiCaprio, displays characteristics of both madman and genius. In the latter half his inner conflicts influence greatly his actions, which at times seem sadistic and crazy, yet we are gently reminded that behind the rumour and myth that grew over the years, lies a human being, as vulnerable and futile as the rest of us. Within the first half of the focus is mainly on that of the lesser known ""young Howard"" whose daredevil, heart throb antics seem a million miles away from the 'insane old man of Vegas.' And with this sets one of the main themes of the movie the price and pressure of fame on those inept to cope with it, one which I'm sure has personal affiliations for the director. <br/><br/>Hughes as a character is dynamic, resourceful and intelligent, demonstrated early in the successful competition of the over budget and overly ambitious Hells Angels. It appear that Howard's devotion in life divides, albeit unequally, into his three passions; film-making, aviation and woman. Never able to maintain a perfect balance his obsession with the production of 'the Hercules' causes him to loose the seemingly most important person in his life, Hepburn. And yet although most of his wounds are self-inflicted Scorsese touch is so compassionate that one cannot help but draw both sorrow and inspiration from the story. Although ultimately sub-due, the films tone cannot be said to be entirely depressing. In fact one of the most appealing qualities of Howard's character is his adversity in the face of defeat. He breaks several world records, overcomes the conniving Wuan Tripp and sustains his fortunes against all odds. <br/><br/>If nothing else The Aviator is great story of one of Americas greatest fallen hero's, who outlived his legend. Expect the usual master class in directing from Scorsese whose passion for the subject is conveyed on screen. The acting is also adequately executed, and for once DiCaprio I think lives up to his hype, it also must be mentioned that Ian Holm steals every scene he's in."

","Legends about Howard Hughes are numerous about his final days, when he cocooned himself in a hotel in Las Vegas, but this film offers some astonishing insights about the reclusive billionaire even for those familiar with his legacies.<br/><br/>Hughes was a colorful and interesting man, a tireless workaholic successful in almost everything he did. Even when a project failed, he'd bounce right back, never giving up at any time. As the Aviator, he actually held a speed record for a flight at one time. He was a film producer. He was popular with women. He founded an airline. He owned casinos in Vegas. And on and on. Although Leonardo DiCaprio' performance captured this unique and enigmatic man's puzzling personality well, he doesn't resemble him enough.

Special effects of a plane crash he miraculously survives are executed with uncompromising intensity. The rise of the entrepreneur is depicted well; the ferocious and unwavering spirit of Hughes is clearly defined, as is his ultimate descent into a paranoid reclusiveness. The scene with the milk bottles will leave you shuddering as you consider the tragic degeneration of a man of his stature. The film is not exploitive in this, but sympathetically offers insights into this man's psychological state.<br/><br/>The movie achieves all that it sets out to do, and will leave you thinking afterwards."

"rainking_es","8","2","3","9 August 2006"," Magnificent.
","Howard Hughes was an iron and steel industry tycoon, a reckless pilot, he owned an airlines, he was a cinema producer, a playboyÂ… A man who live a hundred lives in just one, who defeated death itself after a brutal plane crash... A man that ended up devoured by his own personal demons, his neurosis and his phobias. They turned him into a hermit, locked up in a motel room. A great story to be adapted to the big screen... And who would adapt it better than Martin Scorsese (maybe the best director alive)? I think the first difficulty to avoid was the election of the main actor. I mean, if you choose the wrong guy then the whole project will crumble. Di Caprio, he's a hell of an actor, he's so good, but he still looks like a teenager. Anyway, that's something that all the actors of his generation have in common, so let's just say it is a lesser evil. He carries with the whole weight of the movie and that's a big pressure he just overcame. The rest of the cast is so good as well, specially Cate Blanchett who beautifully plays Katharine Hepburn. The only one who looks out of place is Kate Beckinsale (that poor little thing playing goddess Gardner?? Come On!!).<br/><br/>A magnificent movie, so ambitious, that honour the legend of Howard Hughes and his megalomania. A good script that perfectly set out the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" of Hughes' descent into hell. Maybe it would've been interesting to stress the years that Hughes stayed confined... but it's OK as it is, 'cause Hughes was much more than a neurotic.<br/><br/>*My rate: 9/10"

"EUyeshima","8","2","3","2 June 2006"," Hughes at His Peak But Epic Biopic Not Quite a Masterpiece
","This is an audacious, surprisingly amusing piece of Hollywood film-making by a veteran craftsman of the first magnitude, yet for a number of reasons, not necessarily of Martin Scorsese's sole doing, the movie does not resonate as much as you wish it would. In staying true to the spirit of multimillionaire magnate Howard Hughes between the late 1920's and the late 40's, Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan are stuck with the facts as they happened, and consequently, the film feels episodic with a great, sometimes dazzling story in the first 2/3 of its epic 166-minute running time and a pedantic, only occasionally involving last hour.<br/><br/>You need to have some familiarity with Hughes' life to understand his halcyon years proving himself as a Hollywood tycoon worthy of respect, and his legendary excess during the three-year production of the now-forgotten ""Hell's Angels"" is captured perfectly here with truly thrilling aviation sequences. Scorsese then focuses on Hughes' romance with Katharine Hepburn and captures the oddball chemistry of burgeoning eccentrics amid the frenzied environment of studio-owned Hollywood, in particular, the Cocoanut Grove nightclub. These sequences remind me a lot of Scorsese's failed musical, ""New York, New York"", but this time he seems far more assured. Ava Gardner enters the picture in the forties, as Hughes builds luxury airplanes that can't fly and his obsessions and paranoia start to take over. There's a magnificently filmed sequence of Hughes crashing his XF-11 plane in the middle of Beverly Hills.<br/><br/>Once he recovers from this incident, the film starts to drag, as the story shifts focus to the power struggles in positioning Hughes' airline TWA against the European-route monopoly of Pan Am and the machinations of Pan Am CEO Juan Trippe and the corrupt Maine senator Owen Brewster who investigates Hughes' WWII government contracts. Even the legendary mini-flight of the Spruce Goose fails to excite this late in the story. Only Scorsese's famous ""Taxi Driver""-like, mind-bending touch brings off the surrealism of the sequences where Hughes locks himself up in his room. The film ends rather anticlimactically with Hughes' successful 1947 appearance before Brewster's committee before he drowns in his obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's chief asset as an actor is his intensity of purpose, and as Hughes, he has plenty of opportunities to display this attribute with his character's obsessions with aviation, movie-making, glamorous movie stars and ultimately germs. What he is missing is a level of gravitas that would have made his character's increasing eccentricities more bearable to watch. Even though the reed-thin Texas-tinged voice is accurate, there is something perpetually juvenile about DiCaprio's appearance regardless of the twenty-year span of the story. This unfortunately compromises the chemistry between him and the obviously more mature Cate Blanchett, who initially seems to be crossing the border into parody as Hepburn. She displays the familiar brusque manner without caution and even affects the recognizable voice but with an inaccurate throatiness that belies the legendary actress' high, fluttery pitch at the time. Nevertheless, she eventually finds her grounding, especially as she recognizes their too-similar personalities and softens during the Hepburn family gathering scene.<br/><br/>With less to do, the too-patrician Kate Beckinsale is in over her head as Ava Gardner, unable to convey the real actress' palpable sultriness or predatory voraciousness without posturing. On the other hand, Alec Baldwin is becoming a stronger character actor with every new film, and he plays Trippe with disquieting authority. John C. Reilly plays assistant Noah Dietrich in his typically hangdog fashion as he subsists more in the shadows. Alan Alda plays Brewster with Hawkeye's familiar mannerisms unafraid to show the underlying sliminess of his character. All the externals are impressive - Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing (the pacing never drags...just the story), Robert Richardson's cinematography, Dante Ferretti's production design, Sandy Powell's costumes. Yet for all of this, the movie falls short as a masterwork in Scorsese's filmography. This is a film to respect and not to love.<br/><br/>The first disc has an excellent commentary track by Scorsese, Schoonover and producer Michael Mann - all full of insights without being pedantic. The number of extras on the second disc of the two-DVD set is staggering, really too much for anyone except for those deeply interested in Hughes. There is one deleted scene and twelve separate featurettes and documentaries covering everything from the production to Hughes' role in aviation to OCD to the music. Beyond the sheer number, my complaint about the set is that it's hard to maneuver around the decidedly viewer-unfriendly menus."

","This is the movie changed my mind about DiCaprio - he is positively brilliant as Howard Hughes a man whom I've always held in the highest regard. Having said that makes me also focus on the films one flaw. the compulsion to portray the exceptional as eccentric or flawed psychologically. At the beginning of the 20th Century we much admired the brilliant and extraordinarily productive; now the trend - indoctrinated by the NEA schools and academia - is to find them abnormal and praise, instead, conformity. All part of Dewey's plan for education to create a docile compliant citizenry. How VERY wrong that is. Fortunately the gifted people who produced this film and the superb acting by all make this a truly memorable experience. HBH"

","This movie could have been a wonder if the main character had been portrayed by anybody else but Di Caprio. I have to confess that I appreciate Mister Caprio's efforts to fit the great and complex character, but its not enough, obviously. He does not succeed in making us forget leonardo and see Howard. The womanizer Hughes was not present at all: Leonardo is shy and appears as such. The ""Lolita"" scenes with the 15 years old actress is not believable. seduction and Bluff parts of Hughes' personality were not there. Good rates: Alan Alda, mean and corrupted ; Kate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn: wonderful!; John C.Reilly: good as usual in a supporting role; the story. Other bad rates: the coloring choices: interesting but not always relevant (ex: the golf party between Hughes and hepburn).<br/><br/>Please watch it anyway, it's worth it, but it could have been a great movie. Robert Downey Jr did well in ""Chaplin"" what Leonardo Di Caprio fails here. But it was not an easy challenge. Congatulations anyway for your real efforts, Leonardo."
"wsanders","8","2","3","2 January 2006"," Brilliant and Eccentric
","I was expecting a long conventional biopic and much to my surprise this picture turned out more eccentric and interesting than I thought it would. The SFX were understated and perfect, particularly the brilliant use of large-scale remote controlled model aircraft instead of cheesy-looking CGI. I kept guessing why the color palettes shifted so wildly and inexplicably (the movies doesn't really kick into full color until we are introduced to the celestial lair of Hughes' arch-rival Juan Trippe.) The cast is eccentric and spot-on. Everyone noted Blanchett's turn as Hepburn, but the rest of the cast rises to the occasion; Adam Scott is especially fun as Hughe's pencil-mustachioed, fast-talking publicist. There's the odd mix of dangerous and jolly fun from ""Goodfellas"" here in the progressions of Hughes' philanderings and worsening mental illness, and the movie builds steadily to its climax. Stick with it and you will be rewarded."
"MaxBorg89","9","2","3","17 December 2005"," A stunning combination of madness and genius
","That Howard Hughes certainly was a particular individual: billionaire, filmmaker, engineer, aviator (as the title reminds us), ladies'man, but also an eccentric sociopath who wouldn't even open a door if someone else had touched it first. Not a bad subject for a movie, and Martin Scorsese decided to accept that challenge. And frankly, why not? This film was an excuse to bring Hollywood's glory years back, those years the director is so fond of, the period in which most of The Aviator is set. And let's not forget one of the movie's key themes, obsession, something Scorsese knows quite well (it took him almost 20 years to make The Last Temptation of Christ and 30 to do Gangs of New York).<br/><br/>The first half of the film is the best one, as we witness Hughes'(Leonardo Di Caprio) first important battle: the one he fought to complete Hell's Angels, which was the most expensive picture of its time. When he's not shooting said war flick, he spends his time as any other wealthy guy: dating movie stars. The focus is on his relationship with Katharine Hepburn (a picture-perfect Cate Blanchett), although we're also granted glimpses of his affairs with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani). Through these acquaintances, we even get to see a different side of show business, namely what famous actors do off camera (Jude Law is tremendously fun as a drunk, all but heroic Errol Flynn).<br/><br/>After that, serious trouble begins: Hughes' various manias start to increase and get worse, making him more and more alone, with nothing but his money and his extreme ambitions to keep him company (that's probably why The Aviator is called ""Scorsese's Citizen Kane""). And he's gonna need that money, since his airline might get thrown out of business, courtesy of a group of people led by Pan Am boss Juan Trippe (an impressive Alec Baldwin) and a corrupt US senator (the justly Oscar-nominated Alan Alda).<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's a film about power and the war fought to keep that power, as well as the struggles we have to face in order to make our dreams come true. And in Leo Di Caprio, Scorsese has found a man capable of successfully portray the incarnation of innocence, enthusiasm, genius and pure madness, all in the same person. While in Gangs of New York he was second to Daniel Day-Lewis, this time the former Titanic star has the chance to shine on his own, and impress us he does, particularly when his eccentric billionaire starts losing it completely. Shame the two didn't venture more into what drew the crazy man, but The Aviator nonetheless remains a compelling, epic story.<br/><br/>Love classic American movies? You'll love this one, too."
"rebeljenn","8","2","3","13 November 2005"," Excellent, the best of 2004
","The Aviator is my personal favourite film of 2004. I was amazed at the story-telling and the wide mix that made this film. It's a documentary, and it is blended with action, romance, psychology, history, and a great music track. The attention to detail and the picture is excellent. Scorsese does a fine job portraying the mood for every scene in a combination of images and audio. The characterisation is done as brilliantly as some of Scorsese's other films. If you are looking for an excellent storyline, characters, and cinematography, then you must see this film. It stands on its own very well - as a story and as a biography.

"BirdmanT7","Null","2","3","21 June 2005"," The Aviator: Fact or Fiction ?
","""The Aviator"" has all the great elements of a great film yet its still a typical Hollywood movie. There is a great scene when Katherine Hepburn tells Hughes: ""we are not like others, are we Howard?...don't let them(publicity) in because they will make you into a freak"". I think Scorsese did exactly that, he doesn't let you into the real life of Howard Hughes. He feeds you what you have heard or read in tabloids over so many years and there is nothing new you will discover in this film. <br/><br/>I don't know why but Aviator didn't feel like Scorsese's film? it looks and feels more like Spielberg or Ron Howard film?. Then again Scorsese's last few films are a far cry from his ""Raging Bull"" days and this is where I was kind of disappointed because Scorsese use to push the envelope and didn't conform so much to the Hollywoood formula. This film with all its great photography and cast yet it remains an empty film and not the work of a great film maker like Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Aviator got a lot of great reviews and nominated for many Oscars and I admit I did enjoy watching it for its masterful film craft but at the same I think there was so much more about the elusive life of the great Howard Hughes that some how this film refused to even make a hint of it. For example its true that Hughes was a great womanizer but its also true that he also liked to sleep with Men; he lived bisexual life for many years, he had many affairs with stars like ""Cary Grant"" and ""Guy Maddison"", and even ""Gary Cooper"", etc,this is all documented in Darwin Porter's book ""Howard Hugues: Hell's Angel"". This is why again I find the similarities of Spielberg/Ron Howard childish eye candy style of film making, whom both made their own version of books like ""Color Purple"" and ""Beautiful Mind"" and decided to omit that dirty little secret. <br/><br/>I just think if you are going to make a film about someone's life why not be more honest; sure Hughes was depicted as being as arrogant with a huge ego but in this day and age to make a film and depict someone so one dimensional which adheres to all myths and tabloids its just playing it too safe for someone like Martin Scorsese. Oliver Stone's film of ""Alexandra"" may have not gotten such great reviews maybe because he debunked how history had depicted Alexandra, but yet he stated the truth written in History about the Greek way of life at that time and Alexandra's relationships with both men and woman; his sexuality didn't make him less of a man and the same would apply to Hughes. However, Stone refused to compromise his integrity as a film maker and I am really sorry to see Scorsese has in the Aviator, and please don't think I am saying because I some some GAY advocate, because I am not, the truth about Howard Hughes has been well known for years in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I was impressed with De Caprio's performance mostly in the second half of the film; but I still felt he was too young for this role. If you see any photos of Hughes even in his twenties he looked very mature and even older; he was big man, brisk in stature, 6""4 in height and well built. I once saw a TV mini series called ""The Great Howard Hughes"" played by Tommy Lee Jones and I must say to this day I have yet to see anyone match that performance; because Tommy Lee Jones comes from Texas and even looked like Hughes and he really nailed it, De Caprio doesn't even come close to how Hughes looks or to that performance of Tommy Lee Jones, but for today's young audience they wouldn't even know the difference; De Caprio is picked because he is liked and well known by a wide audience regardless he fit this part or not.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good and entertaining film about a fictional version of Howard Hughes but one really has to question how much is fact and how much is fiction?. Perhaps the court hearing are the high point of the whole film, one has to admire and respect Hughes for his integrity fighting for his beliefs and love of Aviation, I hope one day Mr Scorsese does the same when it comes to making films the way he use to."
"skeiwalker","Null","2","3","19 June 2005"," Flat as a Pancake
","This movie has no emotional resonance. It is one of the flattest movies I've ever seen. None of the actors or actresses are able to establish why their characters do what they do, or why you should care. Cate Blanchett was terrible as Kate Hepburn...it was painful to watch her. Leonardo Di Caprio was like a cardboard figure throughout the movie. However I think the real weakness was the writing. How is it possible to take the biographical story of a person who led a very interesting life and make it so boring? This movie may have had some acclaim last year because last year was a very weak year for good movies, as they go."
"donald_rose","7","2","3","14 June 2005"," Well made but in some need of objective editing
","This is a fine, well-drawn film overall and I recommend it. However it falls short of a masterpiece and the areas of supporting cast and editing appear to be the main problem.<br/><br/>The era and its style was evoked very well but despite having the dates appear on the screen I sometimes got confused about just where the story was. Some special effects were really excellent and some were just a bit pedestrian. For example, the spy plane crash sequence just didn't ring true but I can't say why.<br/><br/>Without question the main leads: DiCaprio and Blanchett, were brilliantly accurate in evoking the personalities and feeling of the very famous characters they portray. Blanchett is perhaps the greatest film actress on the screen today and in time will be spoken of with the same awe and reverence as Streep and Hepburn herself. I have to be honest and admit that I was pleasantly surprised by DiCaprio's portrayal. He could easily have damaged my immersion in the story with an off-key effort but it was spot-on and carefully underplayed Hughes' known peculiarities. These two actors made the movie a success.<br/><br/>Most of the supporting cast were well selected and did a fine job with only a couple of minor exceptions.<br/><br/>Alan Alda is as always a complete delight. We have all seen low-life politicians like Sen. Brewster and he captured the person well. Why can't we find a good role for Alda as the main star of a movie? <br/><br/>Ian Holm was competent in his usual highly underplayed style. I don't know if the character he portrays ever existed or if it is a composite but it seems Holm struggled to give flesh to a character which was very thinly written.<br/><br/>Beckinsale is less accurate in her portrayal of Ava Gardner and it felt like she 'phoned the role in' rather than inhabiting the character as the two main leads managed to achieve. I keep feeling that there is a good actress under the pretty facade and I would love to see here in a role which gives here an opportunity to act and not just be pretty.<br/><br/>Gwen Stefani. Why bother? She didn't look like Harlow, she didn't sound like Harlow. Mercifully her scenes were brief. Perhaps an exercise in good editing taste by Scorcese? Overall, the editing seems to be self-indulgent and the movie would benefit from a more objective cut. There are some excellent actors who would have done the roles of Gardner and Harlow better but these were mild deficiencies."

Leonardo without a doubt has become a very fine actor, and the clip they showed for his nomination of ""Best Actor"" looked extremely interesting. So, when it came to best picture I was all for ""The Aviator"" or ""Finding Neverland"", but then ""Million Dollar Baby"" took it and I was upset. Still, I had to see ""The Aviator"".<br/><br/>While the movie has a very stunning atmosphere and fine actors that can steal the scene, it's not a very interesting story. Howard Hughs, no, I do not know that much about him. In fact, I didn't realize what he really did until I saw this movie. But he just seemed like any ordinary a-hole in life. The movie could have been something spectacular, but the person and story just didn't interest me. So, I'm so sorry Martin, you were not handed anything that could have been gold. This was the problem, because it was too long and the main character wasn't that interesting, you loose track of the film.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is a good all around film to watch for a Saturday. Is it a watch? Oh, yes. 2 hours and 45 minutes of Leo is a little much to handle. But I would recommend it to see good flick, but that's all it is.

His life long phobias and his obsessive-compulsive disorder would cause him to exile himself from friends, lovers and business stalwarts. The world he once believed to own would become a secret world unto himself.

"aubreysparrow","8","2","3","8 April 2005"," Made well, but the plot sucked
","Martin Scorsese's The Aviator is a depiction of the life of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes was a pilot, a billionaire, a businessman, and before anyone else, a ""womanizer"" and a victim of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He cared very much about what he did, and demanded a good title, not the rich boy from Texas. Now, did this movie, with Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, portray his life well? First we need to look at what Hughes' life was. In a sense, his problems started with his mother. In the beginning of the movie young Howard Hughes is being adamantly bathed by his mother, ensuing the OCD, and talking to him on how ""he is not safe,"" ensuing paranoia.<br/><br/>This is normal for one of Scorsese's films, considering many of his main characters have problems and/or are trying to find their way in life. The director did portray the drama in Hughes life, putting special emphasis on the presses flashing light bulbs, screaming, stepping on light bulbs, etc. I, personally did not like how much emphasis they put on the drama. I think they made the film kind of confusing on what it was really about, which makes it hard to do things like this. When I walked into the theater I thought I was going to see an awesome film about planes, and movies, because that's what Howard Hughes is essentially known for, by most people, but it trailed from film, to aviation, to the drama in his life and women. I thought to much was focused on the women in his life such as Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani), Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and other teenage whores.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job, however, of transitioning through these. So I guess it made it less abrupt. He also did a good portrayal of Hughes in general, making his passion for what he did believable, and I was impressed by the determination he bought to life. He did an excellent job as Hughes, but personally I didn't think it was the best portrayal of a character, but that's my opinion.<br/><br/>Now, this is one of the best portrayals of a character that I have seen, Katherine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett. Just a few things that made it good, the looks, the fake laughs, the accent, the attitude, the words she used, it was brilliant. I would like her to win her Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>This is one thing I like about directors like Martin Scorsese, Peter Weir, and others; they get really into there movies. They make sure they are down to the point historically correct, and they actually care about them, and in a sense they are the only people who produce it. For example, Scorsese recommended to Blanchett to watch Hepburn's first 15 movies to get everything down, so she did, and she also took cold showers, something Hepburn is known for, whether that helped her acting or not I don't know.<br/><br/>The movie portrays two decades of Hughes' life, and Scorsese must of wanted it all because he put it into a long, dragging 3 Hours (2 hrs. 46 minutes). What is interesting is it won the Oscar for best Film Editing, but they should of edited out about an hour, then I would understand.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like about The Aviator was that it kept switching plots. It's called The Aviator, so plane people go in there, rightfully expecting aviation, and aviation is 25 % of the movie, I went in there because I heard of his movies, another 25%, etc. I liked the movie, but I thought it was a good movie for people who have never heard of Howard Hughes, it sums in basic terms.<br/><br/>It had the lead in the 2005 Oscar Nominations, 11 total, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Leonardo DiCaprio and Best Supporting Actress, Cate Blanchett.

This is always a problem for me, but even more than usual when I have unrealistic expectations of Scorcese's work. Isn't making these things right part of film editing? And didn't this film just get an Acadamy Award for film editing? What's wrong with this picture? And, if that weren't' enough, in one of the aforementioned scenes, we are led to believe that two people will order dinner and eat in a ballroom which seems to be in a perpetual confetti snowstorm. Yum! ??? !! Soup with extra schmutz!<br/><br/>The glaring faux pas notwithstanding, there is much to recommend this film. The performances are at times great, the effects occasionally spectacular, the cinematography above average, the dialog often crackling and the overall experience well worth the effort of watching.

","Let's see...I liked the movie, I think it was s smart and captivating portrait of a great American personality. The cinematographic quality was, to me, stainless. The script was wonderful and the performances...astounding! Leonardo Di Caprio, although not my favorite actor, did an amazing job playing Howard Hughes. I did not really trust him to play a character like Howard Hughes, but he did it wonderfully. It has to be said that it must not be easy to play a paranoid and psychologically affected character such as Hughes and he really deserved the Oscar for his performance. Cate Blanchett was delightful to see as Katharine Hepburn, she manages to show in the screen the charms and tenacity of the legendary actress. She was amazing and I was glad to know that her performance was not ignored by the Academy. The movie was filled with the glamour and excitement of the 40's and 50's. Yet, I think there was definitely something missing, the picture was probably too long, slow and had a controversial ending that can be thought to be great by some and unsuitable by others. My overall comment is: A great picture that deserves to be taken into consideration, but not enough to be considered a masterpiece."

","The Aviator is a good movie. and I guess what upsets me is that It should have been a GREAT MOVIE. It stumbles and falls so far away from Greatness that it leaves me yearning for the great movie that it could have been.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna repeat the plot, it's a basic bio-pic, in which Leonardo DeCaprio SHINES as Howard Hughes. It's his performance that holds the movie together.<br/><br/>If anything, I find most fault in the SCREENPLAY by JOHN LOGAN which was LAZY and un-layered. In John Logan's world people just don't suffer complexities, they fall easily into Hollywood archetypes --- the fighter, the dreamer, the risk-taker, each of these Howard Hughes get a scene. But none of these traits come together to give him a three-dimensional personality. John Logan is a good writer, he can spin a good line, but he can't string together plot, or character complexities to save his life. <br/><br/>Martin Scorcese is a master, YES. Goodfella's was AWESOME, I even loved, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, one of my favorite films. But with Gangs of New York, and The Aviator, he seems to be trying to HARD. Martin Scorcese is a MASTER, YES, but in The Aviator he is not masterful. He does not strive to give us a great film. just a great looking film.<br/><br/>The idea of a RICH MAN with a DREAM that goes on to make his Dream happen in itself is not very exciting. I mean, he is after all A RICH MAN, it's very easy to make your DREAMS COME TRUE when you have all those resources. So, his fears, his phobias, and his psyche, all the things that would have made a great bio-pic are in the end only merely mentioned and never fully explored and this is why the film never delivers on its promise.<br/><br/>All in all, The Aviator, however, still works. It has very little emotional impact. But damn, it's sure a pretty picture to look at."
"tmart21","5","2","3","23 January 2005"," Overrated
","I think Scorcese was too focused on making what would be perceived as an epic. In the process of doing so, he squandered a chance to make a great film about a fascinating man. The countless close ups and long scenes about very minuscule fact make this movie drag on, and on. My wife and I both found ourselves not rooting for Hughes, but rooting for the movie to come to a conclusion. We both felt a sigh of relief when the film mercifully ends. Yet, even then we have no idea what became of Hughes in his declining years. My recommendation would be to wait for the video. That way you can fast forward through the repetitive pieces of this film. This is not Scorcese at the top of his game."
"cashbacher","10","1","1","18 December 2019"," Hughes should be a technological legend
","As a technocrat, I have followed the professional lives of the people that have made the modern computer industry. Individuals such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison and Elon Musk. They are hard-driving people that had great vision, but personalities and egos that were abrasive, to say the least. Much earlier, there was another person in this mold, and his name was Howard Hughes. This movie is an expression of his life, successes and failures.
DiCaprio puts forward a superb performance as the mercurial, yet brilliant Hughes. In watching the movie, it was easy to project some of what has been written about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and simply replace Hughes with either of those two men.
Of course, there are two significant differences. The first is that Hughes was at his base a test pilot and a very good one. No one ever questioned his courage and willingness to take great personal risk. The second was that Hughes was also an integral part of the Hollywood movie making scene, which made him top notch fodder for the tabloids.
This is a great movie about one of the most underappreciated visionaries of the twentieth century. It is unfortunate that his great flaws were self-destructive, in the sense that they made it impossible for him to function in society in his last years. Had he remained socially and professionally functional, he may have been the greatest of all time."

Scorsese had played the movie's visuals fantastically, with original composition and framework. Even though maybe none actors shone as bright as Leo, all of them delivered in such a way it didn't ruin the flow of the movie.

","I first got this movie, excited that it was directed by Martin Scorsese, who is probably my favorite director. I tried to watch this numerous times and could only pass a half hour. I felt it was slow and that Leo's imitation of Howard Hughes's accent was annoying. I got rid of it-very disappointed with the movie.<br/><br/>Then, a couple years later, I went to a used DVD store and found it for $1.88 and decided to give it another chance. About 2 bucks isn't a bad risk, right?<br/><br/>There was no risk. I have no idea what changed, but I relished every moment of this movie, which runs just under 3 hours. The accent I adjusted to, and I was thrilled with the story.<br/><br/>The movie follows Howard Hughes, a real life filmmaker with OCD. (One movie that he is known for is the 1932 version of Scarface. ) He made many movies with planes, and decided to try flying planes, and that became his new passion.<br/><br/>This movie also goes deep into his OCD, which becomes a part of the PG-13 rating. In one scene, he cleans his hands in a restaurant bathroom so vigorously that he cuts his hands. He also has to wait for someone to enter to leave without touching the germy door. In a more intense part, he locks himself in his movie viewing room nude, talking into a tissue covered microphone. When he has to urinate, he uses empty milk bottles. Aspects like this could deepen conversation on OCD or cause a young viewer to want to learn more about the disorder.<br/><br/>As a film buff, it was also neat to see how Hughes made movies, and all the stars he met. There is a scene where Cate Blanchett plays Katherine Hepburn.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes had a fascinating life and, despite my first assumptions, it made for a great movie. This is one of Martin Scorsese's finest movies."

DiCaprio, as always, is terrific in his portrayal of Howard Hughes. He doesn't just read his lines and try to mimic the real-life figure, but he engrosses himself in his performance. Scorsese does a good job direction g the film, but this one isn't one of his best in the long run. Goodfellas will always be number one, and compared to other hits, The Aviator isn't much to remember. it's a well-made, one-time see kind of film that drags out for an astonishingly long time and doesn't leave you wowed or engrossed for for.

"grantss","10","1","1","9 July 2016"," Fantastic study of an incredible life
","The life of Howard Hughes: film director and producer, aircraft designer and airline owner. A pioneer in all these fields he was a man who had a massive influence on aeronautical advancement, the airline industry and the aviation industry in general plus gave the world some movies which helped the progression of that art form (in particular, Hell's Angels, Scarface and The Outlaw). Not content with being a highly successful and wealthy businessman, leading aircraft designer and movie mogul he even test flew his own aircraft! His private life was equally epic, having long-term relationships with Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner and dating almost every female star in Hollywood at some stage. But he wasn't without his faults, eccentricities and demons, and these are explored here too. <br/><br/>A fantastic study of an incredible life. Master-director Martin Scorsese turns a linear biopic into an incredibly engaging, enthralling and illuminating journey. Despite being over 160 minutes long the time flies by, such is the pace, energy and interest of the movie. Hughes was a larger-than-life character and incredibly influential person on history and Scorsese shows him the respect he deserves. <br/><br/>Not that he paints him as a saint though. He is portrayed as reckless at times and, as mentioned, his personal issues are also covered, and they are covered well. We see how his eccentricities and disorders - germaphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder plus potentially other mental issues - have a large bearing on his life and work. We also see how he manages to go on despite these. Very sensitively and appropriately covered by Scorsese.<br/><br/>Superb performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role. The movie got him his second Oscar nomination, and first for a leading role, and he was unlucky to lose out, having to compete with a brilliant performance by Jamie Foxx in Ray. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is superb as Katharine Hepburn and well deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar (her first Oscar and her second nomination). Alan Alda got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Senator Brewster.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast is star-studded too: John C Reilly, Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner), Alec Baldwin, Jude Law (as Errol Flynn), Ian Holm, Danny Huston. Even the minor parts include Gwen Stefani (as Jean Harlow) and Willem Defoe and the musical numbers include Loudon Wainwright, Rufus Wainwright and Martha Wainwright!<br/><br/>A masterpiece."

Leonardo DiCapreo plays this legendary director with the nuance of his mannerism to his overarching larger than life presence. The writing is smart and intelligent and gets to the point when it needs to and pass along the story with a stable brisk pace. All the supporting cast helps to put order when Howard Hughes more awkward mannerisms take over the story. Kate Blanchet has excellent chemistry with the lead and the two work of each other well.

"joshuafagan-64214","10","1","1","5 September 2015"," One of Scorcese's Very Best Works; Ten out of Ten
","This is the first Scorsese film I ever saw. It is also, with the admission that I have not seen anything close to all his films, one of his greatest. At over two and a half hours long, it is a sprawling epic through the rise and fall of one of the era's biggest personalities. Yet it seems quick, much like some of the airplanes Hughes sought to build. Not short in any way, shape, or form. But quick. It doesn't lag. It doesn't linger too long.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, managing to not show any signs of slowing down even after all those decades of filmmaking, has developed such an intuition for film that it makes this film look like it itself has an intuition. Every time it needs to stay on a moment, it stays. Every time it needs to whip through time, it does so properly (you'd think this one would be simple, but it can be done great (this), well (most films), or badly (the first thing that jumped into my head was The Notebook, which jumped across the one big event during its timespan (WWII) in about five minutes)). When it lifts you up, you feel like you are flying. And when it takes a turn for the emotionally disturbing, you feel like your spirit crashed. This is a film that gave me the feeling that it knew exactly what it was doing and that never let me down.<br/><br/>By the way, is it just me, or is 2004 an underrated year for film? Both this film and the last one that I reviewed (HP:PoA) were made in that year. As were The Incredibles, Million Dollar Baby, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. All five of these films have passed into the category of 'If you don't like this film, your taste leaves something to be desired.' Four of them (sorry Million Dollar Baby, I really like you but I don't love you) are in my top 100 films of all time.<br/><br/>'Twas a quite competitive year indeed. Yet I do believe that in many respects, this film tops it. While it is not my favorite film of the year (that would be ESotSM), it is the film that I believe should have won best picture that year. If there is one movie that best represented achievements in cinema in this year, it is this movie.<br/><br/>As a fan of aviation, I had heard of Howard Hughes. I knew a general outline of his life. But my prior knowledge was naught but a skeleton compared to what I now know. I do believe that I am one of the best arguments against those who say that film cannot educate you about the physical world about us. I have learned far more about the world and the people in it from films and articles than I ever did from school. to quote Mark Twain, ""I have never let school interfere with my education."" All this is a roundabout way of saying that this film paints in your mind a stylish picture of Hughes' life that both rings true and resonant.<br/><br/>I am surprised that there had never been a good biopic of Hughes before this. Given how eventful his life was, it wouldn't be hard. And given his contributions to film, I'm surprised Hollywood hadn't taken an opportunity to once more pat themselves on the back. He is one of the truest examples of the eccentric, popular, multi-talented, billionaires that make the first few decades of the 20th century some of my favorite in all of history and that are so noticeably absent from the world today. And I would argue that few people made more of an impact on this time period than Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>This film shows that. The brash young Texan goes into movies and aviation and... a lot more.This is the first sentence of his Wikipedia page: Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. (December 24, 1905 â€“ April 5, 1976) was an American business tycoon, entrepreneur, investor, aviator, aerospace engineer, inventor, filmmaker and philanthropist. He was a man of high highs and low lows, and there is no one better to show these complexities than the man I consider to be the greatest actor of his generation, Leo DiCaprio. As a fan of Leo and of Hughes, I was hoping that he would deliver. And he did. While I think that he should have an Oscar or two by now for various roles, he is at his absolute best here. I would even argue that it is one of the ten or fifteen greatest performances ever filmed.<br/><br/>You may notice on that Wikipedia description that he did not die until 1976. This film does not show him in his last few decades of life, usual for a biopic. There is a reason for that. With disabling OCD and without proper medication, Hughes went... well, insane.<br/><br/>This film handles that, like everything else, very well. It shows his descent into darkness in startling detail, filming it in such a way that one could not think anything but that he was going insane. Many films would have shyed away from this. Others would have exploited it. Not the crack team of Scorsese/DiCaprio. You get the feeling that you are in cold but unmaleficent hands. What is shown is exactly what needs to be shown for purpose's sake. Nothing more or less.<br/><br/>Watching the film again, I almost wanted Hughes to die in the plane crash so he wouldn't be subjected to torment. But it wasn't a simple feeling. Rather, it was a complex, fully realized one. Not that many movies back me feel that way. Like its subject, it is one of a kind."

","As you can see by the date that this review is published, it appears that I am a little late to the party. However, the quality of this film as well as the talent involved convinced me to write this review. <br/><br/>This is a great film. Alan Alda and Leonardo Dicaprio both played amazing parts, while Alec Baldwin acted with a sincerity that I've not seen since his role as Jack Ryan fourteen years prior to this film. If you are reading this review you've probably heard your share of gushing over Mr. Dicaprio's acting prowess, (if not just check out the message boards), so i'll try not to yammer for too long. <br/><br/>Well, here it is; Dicaprio skillfully masters the character of Howard Hughes. He simultaneously plays a high profile genius with expensive tastes, and a man tortured by germaphobia, OCD, and a host of other issues.<br/><br/>For example: Early in the movie, Hughes requests milk in its original bottle with a cap on it. One's first thought is ""He's rich, he gets what he wants."" It's not until the story progresses further that one realizes that Howard is actually afraid of contamination by germs.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's work in this production is also amazing not only is the filming spectacular, but the 20s, 30s, and 40s aesthetics are all very convincing. Another neat little twist is the process used to make the coloring start out very primitive, but progress in sophistication as years in the film go by. However, this was not obvious. I didn't know this until i checked IMDb wondering ""what the heck those blue things he ordered were"".<br/><br/>In one scene of the movie while Kate Hepburn and Howard Hughes are playing golf, they begin to discuss their own cinematic tastes. Hepburn, remarking on Scarface states that movies should be distinctly different from real life. Hughes states in return that movies should actually be gritty and realistic.<br/><br/>I spent the rest of this scene mulling this query over in my head. Finally I brilliantly concluded that I wasn't quite sure which school of thought I agreed with. <br/><br/>The Aviator seems to share my lack of an answer. Sometimes the aviator is a fun high-flying adventure, and sometimes it is a dark and intense character study. <br/><br/>It is the combination of these two films that make The Aviator a film worth watching."
"luke-a-mcgowan","5","1","1","28 April 2015"," Objectively there's nothing wrong, but please don't make me watch it again
","The Aviator looks like a wonderful film. Its beautifully shot, the costumes and production design are fantastic. Martin Scorsese is a wonderful director, DiCaprio and Blanchett are wonderful actors, Thelma Schoonmaker is a wonderful editor. The screenplay is eventful and has great dialogue. So why did I hate watching this movie so much?<br/><br/>Perhaps it suffers from biopic fatigue. Too much happened in Howard Hughes' life to make the movie a single narrative. Is the movie about his OCD? About his love of planes? About his mad vision for films? About his love life? About his fight with the US Congress and rivalry with PanAm? Scorsese and co. try to tell all of these stories at once, and the result is an overlong experience that is nice to look back on but tedious to sit through.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is good as Howard Hughes - he doesn't nail the OCD with Jack Nicholson subtlety, but the voice is there and the mannerisms are there. He's a solid anchor for the film. Cate Blanchett is delightful as Katharine Hepburn - its a remarkable embodiment and she imbues the part with wit and warmth, but probably not as much as there was meant to be. If she was meant to be Hughes' vice from OCD, the film really should have explored that more. Perhaps if the film career stuff was omitted, there might have been more room for this. In supporting roles, I enjoyed John C. Reilly's always unappreciated dramatic work, but Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda are underused (how did Alda cop an Oscar nomination for this?)<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with The Aviator, all the pieces are there. But I think if they'd picked a few events from his life (the way that films like Selma and Lincoln are doing these days) it would have been less long, less tedious, and more enjoyable to watch."
"wowlover-80667","10","1","1","5 April 2015"," Flies Right Off The Charts!
","Having played a mentally challenged young adult many years before, I believe Leonardo DiCaprio had this Howard Hughes thing under his belt. He just makes it work; the OCD, the facial expressions, the attitude, the accent, everything was perfect. This is no doubt better than all the rest that mimic Howard Hughes' life and career. Though, at the end, it's sort of confusing what happens to Mr Hughes. Did he die? Did he curl up in a ball and stay there until someone came to take him away? There are only theories. Anything is possible. He could've lived on under an alias or simply faked his obsessive-compulsive disorder. That's my father's idea, anyways. But really, another DiCaprio film that should have over ten stars."

Despite remarkable achievement, he had affairs with many actresses, but without a wife in his life. One of his personal behaviours need to point is that he cannot endure any dirty or even somebody touch anything he gonna eat.<br/><br/>Read Hughes's stories, he completed his big dreams for movie, aviation and billionaire through his life. He definitely belongs to the group ""Nothing I cannot do"". I was motivated by his brave, adventure and far-looking thoughts. While the god is also fair, his success in career means giving up something else. Just like his lover Katharine fall in love with someone, due to dissatisfaction for their relationship.

"dimplet","4","1","1","10 November 2011"," An outline without insight
","Viewers here seem to tend to extremes of praise or condemnation, neither of which is right. The Aviator is worth watching, but it could have been a lot better. <br/><br/>Hollywood has such a bad record of historical accuracy in non-fiction films that I don't trust them farther than I can spit. In this case, that's about 1945. It seems most of the basic facts are probably presented accurately up to that point, but the problem is there's not much else. However, I couldn't help feeling I was watching a film version of the Clifford Irving fake biography. <br/><br/>The Aviator seems more like a pictorial outline of the life of Howard Hughes, without providing more than a smidgen of insight. I wish the script had done a better job of providing fictionalized but plausible background to help us understand this unusual man. About all we get is the word ""quarantine"" repeated over and over. And the scene at the Hepburn home is way over the top, and not the sort of family described in Hepburn's memoirs. <br/><br/>As to acting, I am not a big DiCaprio fan, but I think he did a good job here. I don't know if it matched the true Hughes, who seemed more solemn, but who knows? I am a big Cate Blanchett fan, but this time it didn't quite work. The energy and presence of the luminescent Hepburn wasn't there, though the voice was, and some of the mannerisms. Actually, Kate Beckinsale delivered the most natural, convincing performance; I have to wonder how she would have done playing Hepburn. <br/><br/>One viewer compared Hughes' story to Tucker, the car maker. But that is to miss the point; Tucker got eaten alive, but Hughes ate the senator - Alda - for lunch. There was much that was heroic about Hughes' life. The old Hollywood knew how to portray heroics, but this film doesn't seem to try very hard. The film is unusually long; more of that time should have been used to provide more depth to the character, rather than drawing out the insanity shtick, which only emerged near the end of Hughes' life.<br/><br/>Looking through the glowing reviews of Martin Scorsese's towering genius, I am struck by how little these reviews have to say about the film, beyond generalities and a list of who is in the movie, etc. Did they actually watch the film? <br/><br/>The more I reflect on this film, the more it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Frankly, it's a simplistic cheap shot at a complex man. I wonder how many viewers who praise it are old enough to remember when Hughes was alive? Or Hepburn? <br/><br/>But, hey, if you enjoy the movie, what the heck."

","This on-the-surface look at the life and times of one of America's most notorious recluses delivers plenty of dirt, if not much real introspection. The mysterious Howard Hughes is certainly a tricky subject to nail down, with much of his daring decision-making and eventual descent into madness left officially undocumented, but I still haven't managed to shake the sense that there's a lot of meat to this story that's just been left outside to rot. Cate Blanchett is positively enveloping in her role as Katharine Hepburn, for which she deservedly won an Oscar, but the rest of the cast feels too careful and uncertain, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio's turn as Hughes himself. Leo's eyes don't seem bright enough to concoct the miracles he's performing, while his smirk lacks the cocksure authenticity that would make the most powerful men in the country shudder. Director Martin Scorsese seems similarly lost amidst such complicated material, which comes as a real surprise. Scorsese hammers his audience over the head with the outward symptoms that made Hughes such a curious individual in his later years, but falls short in examining the reasonable, humanizing concerns that led to such paralyzing compulsions. As an adventurous history lesson one could do far worse, but for such a long run time and such a colorful subject to deliver so few answers is a major disappointment."

","I could see why Leonardo DiCaprio would want to play Howard Hughes. He was an incredible genius but also deeply troubled man. This film shows how Howard Hughes operated with the women in his life like Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Faith, and others. He was paranoid and obsessive compulsive disorder. He was terrified of germs. There are more scenes in the film about his spiraling out of control with his mental illness than anything else. Despite his obvious inflictions, he was truly a brilliant businessman, aviator, and film producer. Nothing was too small or impossible for Howard Hughes. I thought Cate Blanchet deserved her Academy Award for playing iconic actress, Katharine Hepburn. Let's face it, Kate Hepburn was an extraordinarily gifted actress and an American treasure. Blanchett pulled off the performance perfectly to make even Hepburn proud of it. The relationship between Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn was mutual admiration and love even when she left him. Hughes' love for Kate went further than that. The rest of the cast includes Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner), Sir Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, etc. Everybody in the film business wants to work with Scorsese and who can blame them. I want to work with him. This film is nearly perfect if not too long at times but truly captures some of Howard Hughes' troubled and successful life."

","The Aviator is a grand epic piece of filmmaking. It has vivid costumes, elegant art direction, and great cinematography as its to be expected. The script is very good and the film is mostly entertaining,a nd the performances are great. Leonardo Dicaprio gives the best performance here, and whenever I see him in a film I have to remind myself that he has not yet won an Oscar, and what shame that is. Cate Blanchett as well adds another impressive performance, although as far as a performance goes I liked her as the film went along more. At first she just seemed like a cartoon character, but if the real Hepburn acted that way then who am I to judge. Although this is an impressive picture it is not as great as The Departed or even the recent Shutter Island but it does build impressively in Scorsese's filmography."

","This is a great movie. I think I probably enjoyed it more because I did not know two things - (1) I didn't know much about Howard Hughes and (2) I didn't know that Martin Scorsese directed the movie.<br/><br/>The acting by Leonardo diCaprio in the lead role is fantastic. He is a very good actor and totally dominates this movie. The only guy that comes close to him is Alec Baldwin as the boss of PanAm.<br/><br/>Scorsese very cleverly weaves in some hints about Howard Hughes' mental problems early on in the movie, including what appears to be obsessive compulsive disorder. It was quite remarkable that a person with such health problems was able to achieve so much.<br/><br/>There are some excellent scenes in the movie. The lunch scene with Katherine Hepburn and her family is very memorable as is the scene before the Congressional committee. There are also some humorous scenes such as his defence of Jane Russell's mammaries in the movie The Outlaw.<br/><br/>While the movie is quite long, I would have liked to see the movie continue to the end of his life. However, from what I understand of Howard Hughes' later years, it may have been quite difficult to film given how erratic his behaviour became."
"elshikh4","5","1","1","13 October 2010"," I didn't run into ""great"", ""convincing"", or ""Scorsese"" in here !
","Maybe the worst thing about any movie is asking after its end; what did it want to say? Here, after this bio-pic, it was; who Howard Hughes was?!! OK, according to what we've seen, he's a millionaire with a compulsive disorder, who loves big movies, big planes, and big breasts!<br/><br/>As a follower of Martin Scorsese, and a fan of some movies by him, I asked myself why he handled such a project? The best I could reach, from the very movie, was how that capitalist tycoon wasn't another pedant brat (great scene with him setting among Katharine Hepburn's family as his complete opposite). He was a man with many dreams, obsessed with them, workaholic to fulfill them, and - most importantly - a fighter for them against the American administration which, in here, represents the oppressiveness (government) and conservatism (censorship). Simply, this dreamer's ambition is greater than these employees' ambition; he wants the sky, while they want offices with walls have painting stars on them.<br/><br/>However, I didn't buy it. Hughes was another capitalistic symbol. Making a movie about him, as a man with a dream, anti-narrow mindedness,.. etc. is a try to read him from very keen angles, making a victorious hero of him, which did give me the feel of ""forced"".<br/><br/>Then, it's in the exterior angles as well. While giving it many long scenes, the movie, so provocatively, didn't enlighten us about the man's sickness at all. It was so vague and unrelated to the subject; unless the movie is showing it as just the artist's demons that every time he fights them he wins the best of himself, becoming the hero!<br/><br/>There are many whys too; why Hughes loved Hepburn in specific?, why he had that sickness in specific?, why the movie dealt with the man's cinematic career as just the story's relief?, why we knew nothing about his past but that his mom was washing him as a kid, wishing him well?!!<br/><br/>The CGI didn't work in some shots. To tell you the truth, I was confused why to use them in the first place. For instance, the garden where Hughes lands his plane on it, after the flight with Katharine Hepburn, was CGI. So was that for cutting down the budget or something?!<br/><br/>Scorsese was working out of passion, unlike the usual him. It was more than obvious that he got the things done effortlessly. I have never seen him uninterested on-screen like that before. Most probably it was a deal, a Studio deal, of a movie about the eccentric once-celebrity man; where he gives them what they want, as they want, to give him later the permission to make what he wants as he wants. The smell of this ""deal"" is so overwhelming. Otherwise, this is the most tasteless Scorsese, or let's say the most un-Scorsese, movie!<br/><br/>Further, a major killer punch; Leonardo DiCaprio. I couldn't stand him utterly. I watched this movie 3 times, and for 3 times he failed to drew my attention, so how about any persuasion?! He seems too boyish and no man. His voice is a child voice. At some points, he looks like a teenager with terrible make-up as a grown up. His face doesn't look like the original Hughes, however that's not the problem. The real problem is that Leo's charisma and talent are so weak to be Hughes or else. Teases me pretty much whenever I watch him working continuously in movies for the best directors of his time, to be one of the worst factors in them, while much better actors, who surely could do higher, aren't in his shoes, having his top chances. In a word, disappointment is the basic thing I receive from him all the times yet. And it gets just bigger every time.<br/><br/>What did I love from it? Let me see. The moment of seeing, and hearing, the faucet's water as a torrent of knifes. It's not about expressing the lead's hallucination accurately inasmuch as the expressive power of cinema itself; to speak the unspeakable, and transmit what used to be considered as exclusively doable in other mediums literature is on their top.<br/><br/>The second, and the last, thing I loved was naturally the aforementioned scene of the lunch with the idiots ""who don't need to work since they have too much money!"". It was excellently written, perfectly delivered, and effectively impacted, despite my feeling towards how that was part of a truth which Scorsese wants to see, or wants us to see, nothing but it. It wasn't the best scene of this movie; it was the best of it at all.<br/><br/>(The Aviator) didn't dazzle me as a biography movie, based on Howard Hughes's life movie, or a Scorsese movie. I'm still asking after it: who that guy was? Not a success by any mean."
"chriswalthorne","8","1","1","5 August 2010"," Impressive biopic of a stunning individual
","Martin Scorcese's biopic of the billionaire, movie mogul, aviator and playboy Howard Hughes is a riveting, enthralling epic that successfully examines both the lifestyle and psychology of one of the twentieth century's most intriguing individuals.<br/><br/>The Aviator details Howard Hughes' life in the twenty years between 1927-47, which includes his career as a movie producer/director, his achievements as an aeronautical designer and aviator, as well as the glamorous women he dated and the political problems he faced after World War Two. It also details his struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder and his fear of germs, which would greatly hinder him in his later life.<br/><br/>The Aviator is aided to a large extent by the brilliant performances of it's stellar cast. Leonardo Di Caprio successfully sheds off his Titanic heart-throb image, proving that he is one of today's most talented actors with his stunning portrayal of Hughes. Di Caprio perfectly captures the eccentricity, arrogance and passion that drove Hughes to fame. But the moments that most impress in this tour de force performance are the scenes in which Hughes starts to spiral into the obsessive compulsive madness that plagued him in his later life. It is in these scenes that Di Caprio displays some of his finest acting ever. The only faults with his performance is that Di Caprio never fully captures Hughes' voice, although he does nail his intonation. And he never really physically resembles Hughes until the final scenes. However, these criticisms are merely pedantic observations, and they do not detract at all from the brilliance of his performance.<br/><br/>But the credit can't all go to Di Caprio. Cate Blanchett is equally impressive as Katherine Hepburn. Blanchett perfectly captures the voice, mannerisms and attitude of Hepburn, and infuses her performance with such humanity and insecurity that it comes across as so much more than a simple impersonation. Blanchett rightfully won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar of 2004 for this film, and continued to prove that she is the most versatile actresses next to Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>Scorcese shows off his awesome directing talents again, providing a glamorous yet often disturbing portrait of a tortured genius. And he proves that he is capable with more than we expected of him with the perfectly executed flight sequences. The use of period colour photography is also intriguing. This is most evident in the scene where Hughes and Hepburn play golf, and the grass appears more turquoise than green.<br/><br/>However, the movie does fall short of perfection. One of it's main faults (in my opinion) is that it does not focus enough on the cast as an ensemble. Di Caprio and Blanchett are the only actors who are indulged enough, and I felt that more screen time should have been dedicated to the performances of Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, John C Reilly and Kate Beckinsale. To his credit, Alda makes the most of his screen time, and secured an Oscar nomination for his performance. But I would still have liked to have seen more development of the minor characters, particularly Baldwin's.<br/><br/>The film also skips over important details of Hughe's life, including his fascist politics, which are conveniently airbrushed out of the film to portray Hughes as an all-American hero, which I feel is wrong. His politics should have been acknowledged. It is these faults that prevent The Aviator from achieving the greatness of other Scorcese films such as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>However, if you forgive the film it's faults, and see it for what it is, you will find a brilliant, complex, heart-lifting and sometimes tragic film, which uncompromisingly examines an eccentric genius, which remains one of the best films of 2004 and one of my personal favourites. I hope it becomes one of your's too."
"Niv-1","8","1","1","26 August 2008"," Scorsese and DiCaprio at their best
","That plane crash was probably one of the most brutal scenes that I have ever seen. You could see Scorsese winning Best Director right there.<br/><br/>The performances were all excellent. Leonardo Dicaprio gave a so far career best performance. When he is in the car covering his mouth as he said the same thing over and over, It was very impressive.<br/><br/>Blanchett gives the Hepburn in the movie life, energy, humor, depth, one of the best performances of the year. Beckinsale was also good. When she tears down the tape in the house, she serves the movie the way Blanchett does, though without as much depth, but still is excellent.<br/><br/>Alan Alda deserved his nomination. He is a good villain, but also one who is thinking about playing the Washington game. The whole chairman scene with Baldwin was a good entry for his character. Also with the Baldwin character-Citizen Kane did pop into my head. It was probably the set, but his powerful character doing what he can to tear down Hughes reminded me of CK.<br/><br/>The Aviator is one of the best movies of the year, even if it drags with the hearings, it provides for the set up for one of the more triumphant scenes with the flying of the Spruce Goose."
"michael_the_nermal","7","1","1","22 August 2006"," A Fun Movie
","Martin Scorsese keeps it relatively light with ""The Aviator."" There's none of the foul language or gratuitous violence that characterized his most famous work, ""Goodfellas."" He has crafted a very interesting character study of famous entrepreneur Howard Hughes, mogul of aerospace and maker of B-movies. You see plenty his involvement in both enterprises in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio seems a little too boyish to play Hughes when he is in his forties, but he clearly is so passionate about his role that you forget the little minutiae such as age difference. He plays Hughes with so much energy that he makes the role all his own. It's pretty clear DiCaprio is having fun with this role. Those who dislike hammy acting may think of DiCaprio as over-the-top, but I liked it. His portrayal of Hughes' various neuroses and compulsions make this a very fun movie to watch, akin to Johnny Depp's portrayal of the equally odd and neurotic Ed Wood. <br/><br/>The other actors do a fine performance. Cate Blanchett is fun to watch as the upper-crust actress Katherine Hepburn. She seems to be having as much with her role as DiCaprio, and she's not afraid to ham it up as well. Kate Beckinsdale is fine as Ava Gardner, and John C. Reilly does a serviceable job as Hughes' long-suffering accountant. <br/><br/>Scorsese does a competent job trying to portray his version of Howard Hughes' life. He tries to cram down the message of an eccentric man with huge visions that no one else can comprehend. He seems mad when he tries to re-do and innovate his movies or his aircraft. Sometimes his compulsive behavior gets in the way of his dreams, but in the end he deftly fights off the skepticism of his collaborators or the threats from the competition, in the form of Pan Am founder Juan Trippe. He, like Tim Burton's Ed Wood, is an oddball who perseveres and usually gets his way in the end. Burton's is the better movie, however, because it does not have the gloss of triumphalism that Scorsese's movie does. Scorsese tries to portray Hughes as a sympathetic and ambitious individual, and while he may have plenty of ambition, he is not exactly a more sympathetic individual than, say, his airline rival Juan Trippe. Viewers can see through the attempted good-guy image that Scorsese gives Hughes to see the battle between the airlines as one of survival of the fittest.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty fun to watch overall. One should see it laid back on a sofa with a bag of microwave popcorn and a can of soda. Just sit back and enjoy the energetic performances. It's not high art, but it is decent cinema."

"The_Void","8","1","1","4 September 2005"," Entertaining and well done biopic
","I'm not usually a fan of biopics, or even Martin Scorsese films in general, but surprisingly enough; this one, in spite of it's lukewarm critical reaction, is actually really good, and definitely well worth seeing. Much of the criticism landed on The Aviator has come about because of the fact that it's not very deep and while this is a problem for the film, it didn't upset me too much because what we do have is a stylish and always interesting film, which evenly covers up it's shortfall in substance with it's positive aspects. The film follows the story of Howard Hughes; an aeroplane and filmmaker in Hollywood's golden era. The film starts during the troubled shoot of Hughes' debut film; Hell's Angels, and ends somewhat prematurely as Hughes is still a young man. We are never really allowed to get into the subject's head, but this doesn't seem to be an accident, as it was obvious to me that Scorsese was more interested in portraying the history behind the man than his psychological profile. Scorsese gives us enough of the man to keep us interested in him, but stays true to the facts of his life to an extent in which the film is always kept interesting.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have replaced Robert DeNiro as Scorsese's muse, and despite a disappointing turn in the sub-standard 'Gangs of New York', DiCaprio shines here and really does well as the rich, yet troubled, Hollywood icon at the centre of this story. Scorsese seems to have a bit overboard with the cast, as several big names of the present appear as big names of the past. Cate Blanchett irritated me just as much as the real Katherine Hepburn did, which shows the greatness of her performance. Kate Beckinsale and, surprisingly, Gwen Stefani give life to two of Hollywood's golden girls; Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow as well, while smaller roles such as that of the charismatic Errol Flyn fall to the likes of Jude Law. This was the film's major selling point for me - there's something great about the big stars of today portraying the big stars of the golden age, and the way that Scorsese populates almost every scene with the big names of the time ensures that this is as much a film fan's movie as it is a multi-million dollar blockbuster. Critics can complain about a lack of substance as much as they like, but what I saw here was an excellently stylish take on one of Hollywood's most intriguing figures, and I don't hesitate to call this Scorsese's finest hour since Goodfellas back in 1990."
"barkingfishlake","5","1","1","24 August 2005"," Di Caprio is awesome, but the movie is not.

BUT, the movie is just a bit too long. It does do a very good job on showing how wacky Hughes becomes as he ages. He was quite the man. By the end of the movie you want to shut it off and call it a night. But stick with it and see the whole thing through. Better yet. If you do not have an interest in Howard Hughes....do not watch this movie.... it will mean nothing to you. I cannot say how accurate this movie is on his life, but I am sure you can research more about him if you wish."
"johnmbale","8","1","1","8 March 2005"," A worthy attempt
","This larger than life Biopic of the legendary Film Producer and Aviation Pioneer Howard Hughes is well intentioned and carefully directed by Martin Scorsese, but finally leaves one somewhat unsatisfied. It's the over long running time, and Leo DiCaprio playing Hughes. His enthusiasm for the subject, and strenuous effort at creating the character often dominates the screen, however his youthful looks are at odds with, and he lacks the statue for, the portrayal of such a notable, complex, and commanding figure and his decent into dementia. Hughes is regarded in America as some sort of hero for his spectacular failures as much as his achievements, then his weird reclusive life in the last years. He inherited a fortune from his father, and the fear of germs from his mother. At first looking as much like a baby faced James Cagney as Howard Hughes, DiCaprio is at his best in the later scenes, when makeup has given him some gravitas, and his handling of the dramatic mental decline. It is however the supporting actors that give the film most impact, notably Cate Blancett as a very convincing Kathleen Hepburn, Alan Alda as the aggressive Senator, and Alex Baldwin as CEO of Pan Am.<br/><br/>The flying and cabaret sequences are well executed, the feeling for period effective. The film has a striking over the top pictorial quality as we might expect from a veteran like Scorsese, who as usual turns in a well crafted picture. Certainly worth a visit as it lifts a curtain on some of the more oddball aspects of the elusive Mr. Hughes and indeed Miss Hepburn."

"jerk1483","9","1","1","27 February 2005"," A Truly Underrated Oscar Nominee
","While most critics and Academy voters saw it fitting that The Aviator should receive a Best Pic and Best Director nod, it seems most of America's film-going public felt another way about it. ""Overblown"" ""too long"" and ""not perfect"" were words I have heard used to describe it. In the Scorcese vs Eastwood debate, many claimed they'd rather see Marty win for a better film. But this is, without a doubt, one of Scorcese's finest. Though perhaps too similar in scale to the similarly dismissed ""Gangs of New York"", this is one swift, cunning piece of directing on the part of Mr. Scorcese.<br/><br/>Depicting those years where Howard Hughes teetered on the edge of sanity while achieving so much in so little time, the film's most touching moments are the quietest, when the camera and the actor and director all seem to try and calm down a minute, take a breath, regain control.<br/><br/>Shot and edited like the way Hughes lived, it has a frenetic, implacable chemistry, jumping from extreme excitement to terrifying emotional scares. A credit to Leo DiCaprio as an actor, the sequence at the Coconut Grove bathroom is one of the film's finest, and sloppiest in a way. And that's the way the whole film plays. It almost feels improvised. It has the storytelling of a nine-year-old boy out of breath from a great adventure. And you can't help but connect it's hair-brained energy and logical flow to its anchor, Howard Hughes. And while I won't stay up too long lamenting Scorcese's fifth loss at the Oscars, I will note that he went down with another of his best films. Hopefully, someday very soon, he'll find the connection to his art that Clint Eastwood has found at age 74, and see there's so many more of his own stories to tell. But still, the Aviator is one of those too, and please look into it more closely before you blow it off."
"ed_metal_head","8","1","1","22 February 2005"," Some Turbulence for ""The Aviator""
","""The Aviator"" is the biopic of maverick film producer and aviator Howard Hughes as directed by Martin Scorsese. In ""The Aviator"", we follow certain events of Hughes life (those determined important by the filmmakers) episodically during a time span of roughly twenty years.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes in a solid performance. While DiCaprio does nothing extraordinary, his occasional nervous ticks and varying degrees of a furrowed brow add a nice element to the film. Cate Blanchett in a supporting role as one of Hughes' love interests Katherine Hepburn is quite impressive. Blanchett obviously put great effort into the part as characterised by her rapid, accented dialogue. Alec Baldwin (at his sleazy best), Ian Holm and Alan Alda also put in commendable acting efforts. Sadly underdeveloped are the characters portrayed by John C. Reilly and Kate Beckinsale. Reilly's character is Hughes' second in command, yet throughout the film, he only seems to take notes and complain about Hughes' spending habits. Beckinsale as Ava Gardner essentially replaces Blanchett after Hughes' romance with the latter falls apart. However, while Blanchett fared prominently, Beckinsale floats in and out of the picture.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest problem with ""The Aviator"" is its plot. While most of the plot is actually quite good, there are two serious missteps. The first is in a short scene that starts the movie and is later recalled in a flashback. It tries to link Hughes' mental problems to the single event of his mother bathing him (when he is at a preteen age) while offering neurotic advice (whether this should also explain Hughes' obsession with 'mammories' and milk, I do not know). The second is the brief reappearance of characters whose use in the movie had already ended. There are several examples of this: Blanchett returns much later to see Hughes, but does not and never returns, Jude Law appears for one scene and then reappears in a 'walk on' part only and Beckinsale reappears to 'save' Hughes and then leaves.<br/><br/>Visually, ""The Aviator"" is beautiful. Scorsese uses his full array of camera tricks to get the desired effect. Scenes set in different periods have different looks. The CGI, while not seamless, is not overused. An added bonus is a spectacularly filmed aeroplane crash sequence that is actually quite startling.<br/><br/>In terms of directing, the film marks another excellent effort by Martin Scorsese. While not as good as ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull"", it is on par with efforts such as ""Gangs of New York"". As mentioned previously, the Director uses all his camera tricks expertly to show the viewer what the character is feeling. Interestingly, the director chooses to express some of Hughes' eccentric behaviour in a humorous tone.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""The Aviator"" is an excellent motion picture with mild annoyances. Fans of Scorsese, DiCaprio and Howard Hughes should not be disappointed, but the film's running time of just under three hours may be too much for some."

It's movies like this one that serve to remind us that, despite Titanic, DiCaprio really can act.<br/><br/>Viewed as a biography of Howard Hughes, this is an excellent movie.

"youngmwbg","8","1","1","4 February 2005"," Excerpt of the Life of Howard Hughes
","The Aviator was a fascinating biopic on Howard Hughes, the great aviator, filmmaker and industrialist of the mid-20th century. The name doesn't symbolize so much to today's culture, but for those of us over 40, he was the Donald Trump of his day - but with more genuine wealth and success.<br/><br/>The approach that Scorcese takes is fascinating in that he touches on Hughes' womanizing ways without, perhaps, elevating them to the same level that they really were; and we don't see his failed marriages (shallow as they were in reality). Instead Scorcese focuses mostly on what was, in reality, a short-lived romance with Katherine Hepburn and a shallow relationship with Ava Gardner. Hughes dated virtually every starlet that went through Hollywood between the 1930's and 1950's.<br/><br/>Scorcese also chronicles the many bizarre idiosyncrasies of Hughes. The portrait takes Adrian Monk to the extreme! Much of this was rumor when it was actually happening - and, who know what the truth is? No doubt, however, the weight of the evidence is that Hughes had serious obsessive-compulsive issues, especially as they related to illness, and other damaging psychological problems that seemed to deteriorate over time. I appreciated Scorcese's empathetic portrayal of the man, though there was much, indeed, to dislike in him. Yet, we are left with a touch of sadness for his circumstance.<br/><br/>Leonardo DeCaprio certainly deserves his Oscar nomination (though it is very unlikely he'll win). DeCaprio is a much better actor than he is given credit for - as he has had to fight against the ""teen-idol"" image. His youth is a bit of a detriment as Hughes ages - some of his statements when he is hold up in his film room sound a bit too youthful. Aside from that brief moment, however, he pulls the role off exceptionally well.<br/><br/>One of the best features of this movie is the subtlety with which Scorces - while focusing on the person of Howard Hughes - genuinely captures the era of the 30's, 40's and 50's with set design and period music. This is one of the main features of the film that can leave the viewer feeling good walking out of such a movie. I rate it an 8 + out of 10."

Unfortunately, the great director Martin Scorcese made a beautiful expensive movie, typically aiming to win the Oscar, but emotionally very shallow and with a very weak screenplay, with many parts very similar to a big soap-opera. After 170 minutes running time, I am not sure whether Howard Hughes was a genius, or a psychotic irresponsible prodigal millionaire born in silver spoon.

It's a fine movie. The main problems with it is that it doesn't really tell the whole story of Hughes. It starts with a very odd scene that is supposed to epitomize his entire childhood. Then immediately jumps into him having millions of dollars from oil... but how!? And what about his Mother and Family?<br/><br/>Then it goes into a very good depiction of Hughes the director, wasting his money for a childhood dream, all done exceptionally. Then comes the over-hyped scene with Gwen Stefani which, sorry to disappoint is about five seconds long, exactly two seconds longer than the Jude Law Cameo. Which is what they are=cameos. The whole twenties thing is done very well, with Hughes retreating to the Cocoanauts club about four times. <br/><br/>Then the pilot thing hinted at in ""Hell's Angels"" is kicked into overdrive, eventually leading to Hugh's manic descent into Hypocondria. Yes, you do feel for Hughes, but any hint as to where the dementia comes from is totally missed from the ever seeing eye of Mr. Martin.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett is... overacting. Sorry, love Veronica Guerin but Cate playing Cate is too much. YOu could see the audience shift as she talked. Leo is great as Hughes but like nearly every movie he's been in, you can never shake the leo persona, no one in the twenties stayed that young looking as long as Hugh's does in this movie.<br/><br/>I hope your not looking for a tell all of Hugh's cause, cause Mr.Martin for all his talk of trying not to focus on Hughes' problem, does that for about a fourth of it, then leaves you on an aggravating cliff hanger after the successful launch of The Goliath, preceding a court room scene about the buyout of Hugh's line by Pan Am, which is just as good as any you've seen. <br/><br/>Good movie, that suffers from too much impression by the people who worked on it. It's like your supposed to do research on Howard Hugh's before ever stepping foot in the theatre, if you want to truly enjoy the Aviator. Q-U-A-R-I-N-T-I-N-E."

","The problem that almost all biopics have is that they tell far too much of their subjects' life facts that most of the drama is drained. They never seem to find the important nor key moments in a life in which to imbue the tale, rather they cram a life with minutia, and miss out on any real insight. Such it is with Martin Scorsese's latest film, now out on DVD. The Aviator spans twenty or so years in the life of Howard Hughes, the reclusive billionaire and eccentric, but never delves into the man, merely glossing the surface of its subject, mainly due to the pallid script by John Logan of Gladiator infamy. Having recently watched a DVD version of Raging Bull, from 1980, the difference is stark. I've never thought Raging Bull was Scorsese's best work- it's not on a par with Taxi Driver, The King Of Comedy, After Hours, nor Goodfellas- but it can be argued as a great film, and it's a cut above this film whose first half has potential, albeit flawed, but whose second half reeks.<br/><br/>The film has many flaws, other than the script, though. The major one being Leonardo DiCaprio is simply not a good nor compelling actor, especially in comparison to Robert De Niro. He is, next to Tom Cruise, perhaps the most milquetoast and passionless actor going and radiates none of the magnetism, power, and arrogance of the real man- he is a boy pretending to be a man, and clearly way out of his league. He has absolutely zero range, and is unwilling to let go of himself to the role. He is always Leonardio DiCaprio, never Howard Hughes. Better actors, like Brad Pitt in Kalifornia or A River Runs Through It, do so. DiCaprio is woefully miscast- although since he shepherded the film to fruition Scorsese had little choice but to use him. First off, he doesn't age, as Hughes, in the twenty years of the film- what? Was all the money gone for looser prosthetic jowls or crow's feet? At forty-five Hughes still looks like a teenager, especially in scenes with his airline rival Juan Trippe, as played by Alec Baldwin, a man who in real life was only a few years older than Hughes. Next to Baldwin the two characters seem of different generations- as the fey DiCaprio may not be able to pass for thirty until he's fifty or sixty, and certainly never lets us in to the 'real' Hughes', as he is content with mere gesticulation. DiCaprio also looks nothing like Hughes, facially, but that's not so important if the acting is up to snuff- think Anthony Hopkins as Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon. This evidences itself in that DiCaprio sounds nothing like Hughes, and the constant ticking and twitching he does to suggest that Hughes suffered from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is just too carny for a convincing dramatic role, even up to the film's final shot of Hughes in a Tourette's Syndrome-like daze- which is far too reminiscent of both the prison and end scenes of Raging Bull. It's never a good sign when a director has to rip off a better, earlier film of his own. While not bad, that's also not good. If you need proof just ask yourself if you ever thought you'd hear a phrase like 'a rather conventional Hollywood film by Martin Scorsese' and you'll get the points that Scorsese did not."
"tieman64","Null","3","6","27 April 2008"," Disappointingly hollow
","Though a film director, Howard Hughes is more accurately remembered as a half-baked engineer, an irresponsible pilot, an underhanded billionaire capitalist, and most spectacularly, a world-class neurotic whose famous descent into unwashed, paranoid junkie madness in the years before his death, assured his notoriety after many other late industrialists had faded from the country's consciousness.<br/><br/>You'd think such an eccentric personality would lend itself to an interesting film, but Scorsese seems unable to get inside the mind or life of Howard Hughes. His Hughes is a caricature. A fast talking businessman plagued by occasional bouts of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" plays like a bloated retread of France Ford Coppola's ""Tucker: A Man and his dreams"". The cocky entrepreneur, the boardroom battles, the obligatory romance, the scenes where our hero's ""out of the box"" thinking solves some design flaw. Both films are identical, hollow and overstuffed pieces of work.<br/><br/>Like Jeff Bridges in ""Tucker"", Leonardo Dicaprio plays a cartoonish maverick, desperately fighting for our attention. Attempts by Scorsese to flesh out his psychology are crude. For example, an incestuous scene featuring a naked Hughes and his mother, and a couple shots of Dicaprio obsessing over silly details (handshakes, doorknobs etc). <br/><br/>No attempt is made to link Hughes the success to Hughes and his demons. The ironic fact that his OCD is what made Hughes' business life so successful, is seemingly lost on Scorsese. The film does, however, have a nice running joke about Hughes' obsession with breasts and breast milk. The man has some warped fixation on women and their mammaries, but the film's PG rating prevents this from going anywhere interesting.<br/><br/>Visually, both Coppola and Scorsese's films are overproduced and overly pretty. There's no sense of real time or space. Instead it's all big sets, bawdy colours and larger than life personalities. Scorsese has bought the false view of Hollywood and then spat it back out at us.<br/><br/>Hughes' romance with Katerine Hepburn takes up most of the film's running time. It's a lifeless and dull romance, devoid of wit, understanding or heat. From here on the film loses its energy. Hughes goes from a watchable eccentric to boring caricature.<br/><br/>One of Scorsese's signatures is that he can get inside a character's head by moving the camera or cutting into a scene. When Henry Hill is coked out in ""Goodfellas"" the jumpy camera-work and breakneck editing are similarly jazzed, and when Jake La Motta takes a blow in ""Raging Bull"" it feels as if you're getting smacked around in the ring with him.<br/><br/>If the first hour of ""The Aviator"" flows, it's because Hughes is at the top of his game and Scorsese is riding the character's highs with a visual style that is equally fluid and effortless. But when Hughes starts falling apart, Scorsese loses his momentum. The film drifts into seemingly endless takeoffs and landings and a drawn-out drama involving Hughes's competitors (completely lifted from Coppola's film) which features Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda as a matched set of vipers.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, Hughes locks himself in a screening room, strips off his clothes and begins a babblogue that echoes a similar meltdown in ""Raging Bull."" DiCaprio tries hard to pull off a pantomime of madness, but neither he nor Scorsese taps into the pity and terror underlying the episode.<br/><br/>Hughes died a skeletal drug addict, broken-off hypodermic needles embedded in his arms. He was a sad freak, a depressed maverick, an outcast and eventually a figure of public fun, which perhaps explains why Scorsese tends to play the character's tics for light laughs, even when they don't seem very funny. <br/><br/>A darker, more complex work, would have made the Hughes character more interesting. As it is, ""The Aviator"" is a huge failure, a pg13 grasp for mainstream attention, offering no truth or insight into Howard Hughes the man.<br/><br/>4/10 - Bloated emptiness. Aside from some energetic and fun scenes during the first half hour (all of which stress DiCaprio's cockiness) the film fails to go anywhere interesting."
"itsbarrie","6","3","6","22 January 2006"," Why Leonardo DiCaprio?
","This is one of those rare films where, if you can ignore the main character, you'll enjoy it a whole lot. Not for one minute did I buy Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes -- I'm guessing the only reason he was cast was his ability to sell lots and lots of tickets to that other big-budget movie he was in. If he weren't a big name, you'd assume the casting people scoured the nation's high school drama clubs, found the prettiest boy, and dressed and made him up to resemble a mature man. DiCaprio IS a competent actor, just 100% wrong for this movie. I also took issue with the pitifully inane reason they came up with to explain all Hughes's mental health problems. Rather than take time to fully explore this in the script, in their haste to get those tickets sold, there is a scene early in the film, with Hughes at age 6 or so, which we're supposed to believe explains EVERYTHING. Not the only biopic to take the easy road -- screenwriters were doing this as far back as Words and Music, wherein we're expected to believe that Lorenz Hart drank himself to death because he couldn't deal with being so short. If you can get past the Hughes portrayal, there's a lot here to enjoy: Cate Blanchett as the insufferable Katherine Hepburn; Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda in the Bad Guy slots; exceptionally fine supporting performances; and some neat special effects. If they had only cast an actor who could convincingly portray a grown man -- not a stretch by any means -- I would probably have given this a 9."

","If the whole world tells you that you must see a certain movie, and this movie wins a lot of Oscar's as well, the disappointment will be big if the movie fails to please you. That's the case with this movie.<br/><br/>Surely a lot of good acting, surely a lot of nice costumes and locations, and the computer-freaks have done a great job with the animations, but this doesn't help if the story is thin and never goes into your heart. It doesn't. As an European, used to see movies from my own country and from Europe, I don't understand what part of the body the people behind the Oscar award committee is thinking with. Do they think with the wallet ? Or can't America offer anything better than this ? Really disappointing."
"jawsnnn","5","3","6","2 January 2006"," Mixed bag
","I watched this movie with a load of apprehension. I have always treated biopics with cautiousness, because I don't often get the point of making them. On one hand, the film could be a valuable lesson in history, an insight into the 'man behind the persona' etc... . On the other hand - what do I care? Of course a film like Gandhi breaks the mould once in a while due to its sheer watchability and accurateness, but mostly, Biopics fail to impress because there is nothing of substance in one man's life - no defining purpose or a linear storyline. Life is mostly a jumble of varied and vastly differing experiencing which may or may not be interesting when viewed as a 3 hour package. When the man is Howard Hughes, the risk increases, since even after watching the film I found myself asking the question - Who was this man? Aviator? Filmmaker? Spoilt kid of rich parents?<br/><br/>That said Aviator didn't disappoint me much. As a film it stands out due to a few aspects. First is the direction. Martin Scorcese is a director who has seen many of his creations run on the screen. And the confidence shows on screen, when he experiments with seemingly bizarre tools like painting the screen in colours of his choice, without an ounce of hesitation or explanation. He keeps the film going into places he wants and the viewer follows like a child following his father down the tunnels of New York. We don't see light at the end of the tunnel, but we follow it to the end. He pulls the hero into all the craziness of OCD and doesn't show him beating it to win the odds. That is a relief. Second, as I have mentioned before, the photography of the film is natural and authentic. Closeups of the lead characters, and the CGI generated airplanes rushing at the camera look splendid. Sharp cuts and flashes coupled with eerie sound effects combine to give us a peek into what really worried Hughes when he stepped into crowds and leery photographers. Third, the pace of the film is well maintained, and barring a few places, the story never grows boring or overdone.<br/><br/>But still, I'll have to say that this film is severely flawed in more places than one. The story of the film is feeble to the point of being non existent. There is no concrete purpose to this film - which I personally feel would have given it power and a reason to be. Barely being the child of a talented director cannot be the guarantee to a film's future. Once again I return to the question - What do I care for who Howard Hughes was? He may have been a great person or a mean one at that. But the film gives us no clue towards what we ought to feel for the main lead except pity. That combined with a host of other things, makes you feel as if you were watching a page of tabloid turned into celluloid, one that says 'Oh he wasn't responsible for his craziness, his mother was.' Also, Cate Blanchette puts in a performance which may suit the Oscar jury, but clearly irritated me. Is it the norm for academy to nominate actors who show a combination of insanity and self assurity no matter how averagely done? Cate's role was terribly predictable and I saw a bit of Dominique Francon showing through the chinks.<br/><br/>All in all, you may watch the movie, like it and forget it as one of those movies who have only a past, a present but no future."

","After his former boss became a barking-mad recluse, Noah Dietrich wrote a book claiming that he was the power behind the throne upon which sat Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. That is pure bunk, but Martin Scorsese apparently bought it. No hint of the genius who parlayed his inheritance into a multi-billion dollar empire. Corporate titans Simon Ramo, Dean Woolridge and Tex Thornton all cut their teeth at Hughes; Dietrich didn't find them, Hughes did. Yet Marty couldn't manage to squeeze this into his opus.<br/><br/>I also wish he hadn't worked from a retread of A Beautiful Mind. Like John Nash, Hughes was a racist, anti-Semitic prick who carried on with both sexes. When The Master is made to nip at Opie's heels, something is very wrong! It was perverse to make Hughes this Great Hero, complete with semi-happy ending. Even more perverse was the shot of the projector making the big creep a Christ figure.<br/><br/>The casting was horrid! My boxer looks more like Ava Gardner (reimagined as a whore that can't be bought!) than Kate Beckinsale! And I was constantly distracted by Cate Blanchett's mile-wide mouth and hoary vocals. Was she playing Katharine Hepburn or Martha Raye? Howard bought Kate The Philadelphia Story, the property that turned her career around, after she left him and before she met Spencer Tracy. Yet Marty couldn't manage to squeeze any of this into his opus, either (or get the facts straight). Still, when she exits, The Aviator loses its pop. And all DiCaprio, the perpetual 18 year old, proves is that he has this thing for screwing his forehead into knots. Does his forehead have an agent, and how much does it get per knot?<br/><br/>Hughes was married while making Hell's Angels, but the Mrs. is nowhere to be seen. Marty really dropped the ball here. Ella Rice was his college sweetheart. Exploring their relationship would have opened a whole new side to Hughes. What made him want to conquer aviation, movies and golf? Your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>Audacious and gorgeous as only Marty can do it, The Aviator would have been a masterpiece if the script had been written by a writer who could actually write, then started at minute 105. That's when Poor Little Rich Boy slams his shiny new toy into a Beverly Hills neighborhood. It has to be the most incredible plane crash ever put on film. The previous 104 minutes are a bore."
"Howard_B_Eale","3","3","6","1 September 2005"," Scorsese, please stick with film restoration
","How far the great masters of cinema can fall. THE AVIATOR is a spectacularly bad film with a mere handful of terrific moments.<br/><br/>It has been many years since I have seen a major Hollywood A-picture so filled with grotesque continuity gaffs. I am still scratching my head over how the stellar duo of Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker (perhaps one of the greatest living film editors) could have allowed such a sloppy film to go out like it did. Was the bulk of it farmed out to a team of cutters working on PowerBooks with 12"" screens, so they couldn't really make out the detail in the Panavision frame? There are an astonishing number of severe goofs, from characters facing the wrong direction after cuts to hats on heads where they weren't worn in the previous cut to overlapping dialogue which starts on closed mouths, etc. Period detail ranges from very close to completely forgotten (costumes, hair and makeup are often strictly contemporary). Attempts to replicate the ""look"" of 2-strip, and then 3-strip Technicolor are cute but highly inaccurate, and in the case of the 3-strip sections, utterly distracting.<br/><br/>But the problems aren't limited to technical errors. Everyone is miscast. DiCaprio couldn't be more inappropriate as the middle-aged Hughes. Cate Blanchett turns in a very moving performance, but barely echoes Katherine Hepburn. Alan Alda plays... well... Alan Alda competently enough, but is a total one-note. Only Alec Baldwin, as a restrained Pan Am executive, pulls it off. And I won't even mention Kate Beckinsale's non-take on Ava Gardner.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most appalling aspect to the whole mess is the reliance on CGI digital effects for the bulk of the action sequences. What is the difference between THE AVIATOR and a video game? Answer: none. How could Scorsese ""honor"" the pioneering action direction of Hughes on HELL'S ANGELS by replacing it with completely soulless, one-dimensional computer-driven animation? The mind reels.<br/><br/>This is a very, very bad film."

Long, boring, overly dramatic, and played up with a really funny voice. During one part of the movie, an airplane he is flying takes a horrible crash in the middle of a large populated area. I've never felt happier to see a character dying in a film. And yet... he lives! Kate Beckinsale, a woman whom I admire in Hollywood, had the most annoying and pointless part in the film. She seems to be the ""fallback"" girl for Hues, who he wants to marry, just because, brings him down into nothingness, and then drags him back up because she feels sorry for him. She sort of has a ""woman of the evening"" feeling about her.<br/><br/>You are also not spared in this movie, pointless nudity, which is to say that we see quite a bit of a naked Leo, who is afraid of the germs on his clothes 3/4 of the way into the film.

","What happened at the Oscars? Why should the man behind this get Best Director. Apart from a couple of flight scenes, this movie was painful to watch. The main actors (DiCaprio and Blanchett) were completely miscast in their roles. There is little story to speak of. There's no background to base Hughes' life on when the movie begins, no depth or realism to his grittier, seedier side and no bite or grip taken on his madness. Instead we get a bird's eye view, gently floating over the mostly trivial aspects of his life. I learned nothing from this movie. I was not wowed by any special effects. I did not gasp at any beautiful cinematography. I did not revel in the absolute immersion of an actor in his character. I did not feel that I had to go out and buy the soundtrack, though this might be because I already have ""The Cat's Meow"" soundtrack which shares some of the tunes and certainly the spirit and, by the by, is a far superior movie in my estimation. I will never get the time that I spent watching this back. Scrocese has made some good movies and some great movies but this idea, unlike it's protagonist, does not fly!"
"BrandtSponseller","7","3","6","14 July 2005"," I hope these blueprints are not the way of the future
","I don't think I'll ever quite understand mainstream tastes. This won five Oscars (including for Cate Blanchett's performance??) and was nominated for six others, including directing, best motion picture of the year, screenplay written directly for the screen and Alan Alda's performance?? That strikes me as bizarre to say the least, although perhaps not as bizarre as the fact that the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films nominated this for ""Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film"", or the fact that so many other awards organizations followed suit.<br/><br/>It's not that I hated The Aviator--I do think it's worth at least one view, especially if Howard Hughes fascinates you. But although I agree that there is some decent (but not Oscar-worthy) cinematography and production design in the film, and Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job despite other factors, I had serious problems with the directing, the screenplay and most of the performances (which I partially blamed on the directing). Yes, I gave the film a seven, but a low seven, and from me, that means this was almost a ""D"". Or in other words, I'd almost not give director Martin Scorsese credit for this if he turned it in for a university course.<br/><br/>The Aviator is a biopic about ""eccentric"" millionaire businessman and filmmaker Howard Hughes (played here by DiCaprio). He also had something of a fetish for aviation, as you could guess from the title of the film. Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan focus on 20 or 30 years of Hughes' life, beginning in the late 1920s, when he was making Hell's Angels (1930), and ending just after the infamous U.S. Senate hearings and the public demonstration of behemoth wooden plane known as the ""Spruce Goose"". It focuses on his dueling obsessions in the film and aviation industries, a couple of his relationshipsprimarily Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner, and his increasingly odd ""quirks"".<br/><br/>Since a lot of praise is routinely heaped on The Aviator, I want to mainly focus on the flaws that I believe are present. First off, for the material presented in the film, it is far too long, clocking in at just under three hours. Much of it drags, so the first hour and a half feels more like three. Scorsese has actually had a length problem for some time now--it also seriously marred Casino (1995). He needs to hire an editor who will not kowtow to him. The majority of The Aviator consists of people standing around and talking, and they're usually talking about business. That gives it all the excitement of a 9:00 a.m. employee meeting at a company you don't really enjoy working for. Of course, there's more to the film than that--mainly the romances and the quirk exhibition--but the business meeting mode takes up an unusual amount of screen time. The only time the film becomes really engaging is during a disastrous flight that ends in Beverly Hills. Yes, that's an ""action"" scene, but no, I do not only like action films. Just take a look at my other reviews and ratings.<br/><br/>However, a more serious problem than the length is the combination of direction and performances. The dialogue, in particular, began to grate on my nerves. I'm not sure that the dialogue as written is bad in itself, but Scorsese directs his cast to deliver their lines with bizarre affectations (and I don't just mean characters like Hepburn who did really talk unusually), and frequently talk on top of one another (and I don't just mean the dinner scene at the Hepburn home). Bizarre affectations can work for me in many circumstances. But here, I do not get the impression that Scorsese was trying to make The Aviator surreal (despite the beautiful blue grass on the golf course), Lynchian or experimental overall. The dialogue-delivery and the performances in general tend to play with an aura of ""Hey, we're making a big Hollywood film now"", or, the whole affair seems affected, pretentious, and ""fake"". Perhaps Scorsese was shooting for awards here. Maybe he gets mainstream tastes. To my sensibilities, it seems that Scorsese and Logan were writing and directing to pander to what a particular type of person wants to hear, rather than writing and directing towards what they think is right/believe in artistically.<br/><br/>So I found most of the performances more bothersome than pleasurable, including Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin, both of whom I normally enjoy. Cate Blanchett was particularly grating to me. I've liked her in a couple films, but she's batting closer to .133 for me so far. DiCaprio gave the sole performance--though not Oscar-worthy--that sometimes worked for me. Of course, that's important, since he's the focus; otherwise, The Aviator could have received nowhere near a 7.<br/><br/>There are also serious problems with the ""argument"" Scorsese and Logan seem to be making about Hughes. They seem to place some of the blame for his quirks on his mother, but this is very poorly developed. More seriously, there is a very odd absence of showing why Hughes was as successful as he was--and he was successful, and not just due to an inheritance. According to this film, Hughes was primarily a man who made a number of insane and increasingly financially disastrous decisions while others tried to tolerate him. Even odder, there's a sense of Hughes just ""going along for the ride"". We're not really shown any successful business dealings, relationships, or positive actions. Even considering the film purely as fiction, the character doesn't work for what's supposedly happening ""around"" the character.<br/><br/>Sure, Hughes' quirks are fun to explore, and this and other aspects do occasionally make the film engrossing--occasionally, you forget to glance at the clock. But there are far more serious problems than assets here, and The Aviator is definitely not worth the inflated accolades it has received."

If this is the studio's attempt of teasing for a coming sequel, it fails miserably.<br/><br/>For some, DiCaprio's dramatisation of Hughes may also ring hollow as he sounds too juvenile in the voice department to come across as a powerful, all conquering, devil may care magnate.

","""The Aviator"" is tiresomely overlong, anti-climactic, and indeed as purposeless a screen biography as I've ever seen. Further to the film's discredit, Leonardo DiCaprio is overparted in just the way Patty Duke was when she attempted adult roles. Lacking sufficient presence, he too looks annoyingly just like a high school student dressed up to play a grownup. This limitation robs almost all his scenes of any clout. An exception are those in which he debates with a Senate committee and to succeed needs only recite the well written, David Mamet-like lines there given him. Otherwise, he's pretty much a disaster. Even worse, though equally overpraised in the press, is the usually fine actress Cate Blanchett who does not so much act the role of Katherine Hepburn as mimic that great star in the manner of a female impersonator.

I felt he looked like a little boy, and sounded like a young Tom Cruise. He looks less than his age anyway, and he certainly didn't look anything close to the 41 that Hughes was in 1947. He tried hard, but was just miscast. Cate Blanchett gave her all as Hepburn, but in my view, was over the top. Jude Law looked little like the tall and powerful Flynn, and his accent was extreme.

","I was looking forward to seeing this film. Mr. Scorsese usually puts out such fine films that frankly I am a bit shocked at some of what I saw.<br/><br/>Early in the film, the meteorologist played by Mr. Ian Holm, is engaged in conversation with H.Hughes regarding the type of cloud Mr. Hughes would like in the film... dialog is used relating the desired type of cloud to women's breasts and the meteorologist identifies this type of cloud as ""cumulonimbus..."" However, breast look alike clouds,(and they do actually exist), are identified correctly as ""mammatus"". Any licensed pilot on planet earth knows this, let alone all the meteorologists...<br/><br/>Furthermore, during an early segment regarding how an airborne sequence is to be shot, Mr. Hughes in his role as director of ""Hells Eagles"" is discussing an aerobatic sequence using two aircraft... the engineer states that ""doing double barrel rolls will increase the gyroscopic forces and tear the aircraft apart"" (this is paraphrased by me). But, notwithstanding my imperfect recollection of the dialog, the facts are not correct as nothing of the sort would take place.<br/><br/>In addition, during the sequence involving the flight of the single engine aircraft which has been flush riveted, the film shows H. Hughes flying an aircraft with only a windscreen in front of him. During the flight sequence edited in using the real aircraft, there is a canopy above the pilot's head, clearly visible. Even more unfortunate, H. Hughes' hair through this sequence shows up as light colored, even blonde in a plan view shot, photographed from above as the aircraft flies underneath.<br/><br/>I did not go to this film to pick it apart - it was just another night at the movies with Mama and Baby Bear... I was quite disappointed at these obvious errors.<br/><br/>The whole experience left me asking: ""What was the point of this film?"""

","Although I thought Scorcese had done a good job on this picture, I think it disappoints by not really getting to really express just what Howard Hughes was all about. In two and a half hours a lot more story and lot less glitz could have been shown. I have read several books on Hughes including the Noah Detreich tome. The film missed a lot about Hughes the man and really spent too much time on just a few of the movies he made and a fairly watered down version of what the man achieved as an entrepreneur aviator and inventor. Anybody going to see The Aviator to learn about Hughes would not be much wiser after seeing it.<br/><br/>However, it is a good film and I enjoyed it. The only problem I have with Martin Scorcese is that he has made so many great films I think I just expects him to be near perfect every time.<br/><br/>Just a footnote, an earlier TV movie ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" with Tommy Lee Jones as Hughes and Ed Flanders as Detreich was a much more informative account of the life of Howard Hughes. If Howard Hughes is of interest to you this version also based on Detreich's book is well worth checking out.<br/><br/>After seeing ""The Aviator"" I watched the Tommy Lee Jones movie again on video as I think Leo De Caprio must have also. I mention that as Leo's impression of Tommy Lee Jones playing Howard Hughes was near perfect. Both actors have great talent but which one is most convincing."
"kgprophet","7","3","6","5 January 2005"," Could have been better Casting
","One very important factor in doing a biopic on Howard Hughes is the casting of the lead. As I watched this film, I wanted to buy Leo as Hughes, but it felt like Tom Cruise playing Hughes. Leo is definitely a pretty boy, and this is certainly the biggest role of his career. But I felt that perhaps someone else could have played him better. Someone else who could perhaps give you a glimpse inside the madness. Russell Crowe, although not a match physically, had that kind of insight in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Alongside that, as much as Cate Blanchett was serviceable as Kate Hepburn, I could easily imagine Emma Thompson personifying Hepburn much better.<br/><br/>I have no other major complaints about a film that took eons to make the big screen. It is certainly to the audience's advantage that a film about Howard Hughes be given the big budget treatment. The test flight scenes, as well as the ""Hell's Angel's"" unprecedented aerial scenes are appropriately depicted with top-notch CGI. Perhaps, along with ""Gangs of New York"", having DeCaprio attached was the along way it could get made. For Scorcese, this is his best film in years. He is able to delve deeper into a character than your average Hollywood filmmaker. Scorcese does an excellent job depicting Hughes' descent into madness. The extra length of this film dedicates a good deal of time to this sad aspect. You have sympathy as Hughes fights the takeover of TWA, and the upbeat ending is welcome.<br/><br/>The production design is perfect, no corners were cut. Camera angles and pacing are engaging. The make-up on DeCaprio is excellent. The use of period film quality is unique, and creates an outstanding sense of 'living history'. This film deserves Oscar nominations for almost every category, except the acting. Once again, there's nothing wrong with DeCaprio & Blanchett, but they are not perfect.<br/><br/>I will probably see this film again, only because I can identify with the seemingly overwhelming odds against you when trying to achieve a personal accomplishment. I also identify with being a misfit, but yet being valued by society.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10."

","A true masterpiece of our time and an instant classic for Scorsese fans as well as lovers of all great cinema, The Aviator delivers on every level; from its incredibly convincing, yet not at all distracting, special effects to its engrossing story of triumph and insanity. This is a modern day Citizen Kane, with top notch acting from both leading actors, Cate Blanchett, with her inspired portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, as well as the incredibly talented and compelling DiCaprio who, with this role, graduates from mere movie star to bona-fide actor. And, of course, no Scorsese film would be without unforgettable visuals; you'll never look at milk the same way again."

","The movie was awesome, fast tracked with energy oozing from the pores of Howard Hughes, and Katherine Hepburn role was an Oscar performance. But, a grand opportunity failed to appear, that being any of the women of the 1929 Air Race. The only movie cameo was Roscoe Turner with his pet lion. But then...I have written ""Amelia's Voice"" about that race and it will blow the screen away soon. There is another chance to see Amelia Earhart, Pancho Barnes, and Howard Huges, not in the NOW, but in time travel into the past. What the movie did touch upon was the early years after WWI and how pilots traded in their military records for stunt flying and barnstorming. My only wish was that The Aviator had had more about the fliers of that age."

","I remember a lot of the press about the very eccentric Howard Hughes and also read a biography on him after he died.<br/><br/>the film I think somewhat overemphasized his obsessive compulsive disorder and could have done more about his accomplishments. he was for example a pioneer in pushing for fuselage flush rivets which added immensely to airspeed for any plane.<br/><br/>all the actors and actresses handled their roles very well Cate Blanchett although she does not resemble Hepburn in appearance she nailed down the unique voice right to a T. Kate Beckinsale who is proving to be very busy is even more beautiful than the original Ava Gardner.<br/><br/>Decaprio is excellent as the movie mogul aviation real estate billionaire. no doubt he has indispensable insight into Hollywood intrigue.<br/><br/>the film is about 3 hours and ends rather abruptly. then again, it only shows Hughes until just after the 1947 hearings. I am curious as to whether the filmmakers used transcripts from those hearings. I wouldn't be surprised; a lot of people underestimated Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>20th century aviation owes a great deal to the adventurous spirit of Howard Hughes. perhaps we would have had even more rapid advance had he not been periodically put out of commission by ocd (feel free to do a google search on the topic). it was unfortunate for Mr Hughes that he was born too soon to take advantage of a spectrum of serotonin uptake inhibitors that would certainly greatly alleviated his suffering. I know what I'm talking about, I've had the condition since 1973 but it is nowhere remotely as bad as it used to be. I therefore truly sympathize with Howard Hughes; it is only fair that he made billions of dollars considering what he did for civil aviation and a plethora of other engineering fields.<br/><br/>see the movie for insight into his life.<br/><br/>I find it ironic that a man who had a great deal to do with the advancement of airplane designed passed away in one while it was in flight to the hospital in his home state of Texas."

","Normally when I see a movie I will tell myself ""wow, such and such and actor is really good at that part"" ... this time, no. While watching ""The Aviator"" I saw performances that transcended the roles that they were playing. Leonardo Di Caprio WAS Howard Hughes: I lost track of the fact that he was an actor and not Mr. Hughes himself. I have never seen OCD played out so well --- and I see it every day in a member of my family. Cate Blanchett WAS Katherine Hepburn --- she had come back to life in that theatre and on that screen in no better tribute than could be imagined. They both happened to be in a movie on the screen in front of me and playing parts... and blew me away. I felt that I was watching a newsreel at times --- it was so REAL it was spooky with the casting and the costumes. (A9lthough if you blink you will miss Gwen Stefani!)<br/><br/>Is the movie genius? Maybe. It is long and tedious at times but you cannot fault the acting ...

"CouldHaveBeenAContendor","8","6","18","18 December 2004"," One of the Best Hollywood Movies of the Year
","In all honesty, it must be said that this film is not traditional Scorsese film-making. In comparison to his classics Raging Bull and GoodFellas, The Aviator pales in comparison. However, it must also be said that Scorsese's latest does not feel like the typical over-the-top gore fest that his previous films have felt like (2002's Gangs of New York). The Aviator is far better than Scorsese's last<br/><br/>accomplishment but this is a step out of the ordinary for his usual work. Much like last years Seabiscuit, the era of the 1920s and 1930s is beautifully captured with stunning cinematography and impressive costume design. In technical<br/><br/>categories this film will garner multiple Oscar nominations (if not win the coveted prize). Seeing it at a private screening at Los Angeles Center Studios on<br/><br/>Thursday night, I was quite impressed at the overall feel of the film. This is one of the best Hollywood movies based on Hollywood's golden age I have ever<br/><br/>seen. And with a running time of over 2 and a half hours, I felt like I wanted to see more. Sad to see, but that is one aspect that could have been approved.<br/><br/>The film's ending (or lack thereof) does not exactly impress leaving the<br/><br/>audience at that certain point where you think the film is going to really take off. It doesn't. Perhaps it could be how engrossed I was with the first two and a half hours that ultimately left me wanting more. Aside from that, this is one of my top five favorite films of the year, and it is certainly worthy of all the nominations it can get. While it may not be a win that is far beyond due to mastermind<br/><br/>Scorsese, it certainly should give him a great chance up against such talents as Mike Nichols and Alexander Payne. With all technical aspects aside, the acting should certainly be equally commended. First off, Cate Blanchett instantly sold me as Katherine Hepburn, and in regards to her recent passing, I believe that the performance here is about as memorable as Katherine herself: a legend that will live forever in cinema. If Blanchett is ever again to be nominated for Best Actress, let this be the year. Equally impressive is the underrated Leonardo<br/><br/>DiCaprio, who like in Catch Me If You Can, delivers a powerful performance as Howard Hughes. I can not imagine anyone else playing this role as well as he<br/><br/>did. As to the cast, with the fine talents of Alec Baldwin, the great John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Scorsese favorite Willem Dafoe, Jude Law (who seems to be in every<br/><br/>movie I have seen this season) and Kate Beckinsale it is so hard to go wrong. A tremendous ensemble, a beautiful film, and a magnificent memory. One of the<br/><br/>best films of the year and a worthy Best Picture contendor. 8 out of 10."
"marvingoldfish","2","3","7","7 February 2005"," A sad, but true story of a great genius
","Great idea, this, and fairly well executed, but the movie can't seem to make up it's mind about which way to go. Action, drama, psychological drama, storytelling or whatever... di Caprio performs OK, but he is not credible when he's supposed to depict the then 40-tears old Hughes, and no matter what the make-up dept. did to him, he still looks 23. Kate Blanchett and Alan Alda deliver outstanding performances, as does Matt Ross, and also Alec Baldwin does a better-than-average job. Plane crash sequences doesn't work well (most air scenes do, however), and the movie stops just as things get interesting. Many weird camera angles and abrupt cuts, and also quite a few tricks borrowed from Orson Welles (who performed them infinitely better). Not all computer animation works properly, and somehow, this movie is thoroughly clean. True, clean Hollywood scenery, sunsets, beaches, houses, etc. Even the blood and dirt in crash scene looks clean, and everything looks like a cake with too much icing. It just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Not quite a complete waste of time, but close."
"bob the moo","Null","3","7","13 January 2005"," Beautifully told and with a great story  pardon the pun, but three hours flew by
","Having inherited his fortune from a tooling business, Howard Hughes seems intent in ploughing into his first film, constantly reshooting and reediting it, leaving the money worries to his business manager Noah Dietrich. His passion for flying leads him to invest heavily in his own domestic airline, TWA, while also making motion pictures and having relationships with some of the most beautiful women (and girls) in Hollywood at the time. Despite suffering from an obsessive compulsion regarding cleanliness, Howard seems to be on top of the world, but attempts to steal a section of the trans-Atlantic business away from Pan-Am proves to be a risky venture, following several failed wartime projects, leading to a high stakes battle.<br/><br/>I must be honest and say that, although I watch a lot of movies I don't really care about the real life gossip behind the scenes and hence some elements of this film were news to me; details mainly, but even then I must admit that I knew very little about Howard Hughes outside of the fact that I had seen his name of many films down the years. Certainly I knew comparatively little about his airlines and his personal traits. For this reason I watched the film with some interest but also a pinch of salt as I was aware that these film rarely tell the whole truth. Ignoring this latter concern, I found myself swept along by a great story and a great film and, when it ended some three hours after I sat down, I looked at my watch wondering where the time had gone! The fact that Hughes himself is a very interesting character only helps a script that crams the film full of so much of interest that it is hard not to be caught up in it. At times it labours some points and at other times it will not focus on areas you would like it to, but it still works. I felt the obsessive compulsive thing was lingered on too much once or twice and some scenes featuring it could have been cut down a little bit, but they didn't slow the film much if at all, so it is more opinion that flaw picking. Also, as a fan of the cinema, I expected more of his films to be mentioned but I guess in fairness these are less interesting that his real work. On top of the story, the script is actually exciting and funny as well as being human and involving  a great combination and one reason the hours just went so fast.<br/><br/>I have not seen Gangs of NY yet, so cannot say if this is Scorsese returning to form, but it is certainly a very strong piece of direction that screams class and is very much his work. Complicated shots, one take tracking shots across crowded rooms and so on, all make the film look great without seeming overly flashy. I'm not sure if he has used special effects (as in computer graphics) before, but Scorsese seemed very at home with the cgi shots of planes etc used  some may not have been 100% convincing but it's as close as dammit. Unusually for him, the one place he did fall down was with the use of music as I found the choices to be pretty obvious and a bit repetitive; happily it took little away from the film but it is surprising for a man who wallpapers his films with music well when he wants to. The sense of time and place is spot on, mainly due to great costumes, sets and a real attention to detail running through the whole film.<br/><br/>The cast add to the feeling that this is a quality production, although at times they are a distraction. First off, DiCaprio is great  and I never thought I'd be allowed to say that again. The guy who showed so much talent early on before appearing to give it up to soulless projects is convincing here in many ways; whether suffering with a drive he can't overcome, being on top of his game or just being funny, DiCaprio does it well. Of course he struggles with the fact that he never ages (making it hard to see the passage of time in the film) and that he looks 16 anyway, but he tries his hardest to make us forget this and, for the most part, he does it. Aside from him, the rest of the cast are best seen as support or cameos and generally they are very good. With real, famous characters it is always a risk that actors will give impressions rather than performances but the likes of Blanchett and Beckinsdale are better than that and do both equally well. Reilly is good as always, Baldwin is enjoyable and it is always a pleasure to see Alan Alda, who happens to be great here. The only problem with the cast having so many stars in it is that they are occasionally distracting  for example Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm and Brent Spiner all have little to do other than providing a ""hey look it's "" factor.<br/><br/>Overall though it is a very impressive film and one that is enjoyable to watch even if you start the film with very little knowledge of Howard Hughes (something that modern multiplex audiences will do). The script is interesting, exciting and funny by turns and the direction is stylish without being overly flashy. The cast are all good despite a few of them being more distracting than value-adding."
"mrow","8","3","7","27 December 2004"," Slick & modern but animation effects were over the top.
","Today we saw The Aviator, in a full house. I liked it. I knew it would be long, though I did not warn my wife about that or she would not have gone (don't tell). The story moves right along for the most part - - the cutting is very good (as expected) but I feel Mr. Scorsese could have lost 15 or 20 minutes easily, with no loss of story. I also appreciate the reluctance to do so. I am, however, a little frayed with overly used digital special effects, and I do wonder how an old school Scorsese-type would be persuaded to choose this path during the storyboard process. I feel we are now crossing the line, with directors choosing this method over other available effects. The process is just not 100% right. The impossible ""camera"" angles are distracting (to my taste, irritating), violating all sorts of physics laws which causes an observant person to instantly question the process of placing animations in serious films, and it therefore becomes a dead giveaway: he knows he is viewing a cartoon. It reminds me of the early days of S-T-E-R-E-O, very few younger people would understand this concept. I think James Cameron gets it but who knows for sure. Digital animations were probably required for this; I am suggesting that some moderation of it and additional use of models might make sense.<br/><br/>This would be my prime criticism then, that the effects are in your face; they are anything but subtle in certain scenes. This was true with the other film I saw this weekend (The Flight of The Phoenix), there's relatively little in the way of special effects differences between them. I am witnessing this on an increasing level. All that said, The Aviator visuals are nonetheless impressive (some great plane crashes), and the storytelling, though very good, is artsy. I give the effort a must-see, on balance. This film looks very modern but handles the period feel with brilliance; it is indeed slick. The score and adaptations (Howard Shore) are fitting but not something I'd want to own beyond a possible DVD of the film itself, later on. And you have this: after seeing the film, there is little doubt in your mind who Hughes was, or what sorts of things cranked his gear. -- Don Forbes"
"flyyy4awhiteguy","8","6","19","18 December 2004"," This Film Breezes Through 3 Hours
","The Aviator is a fantastic film, depicting the life of John Hughes. The film touches on his unusual childhood upbringing, using his inheritance to fund a big movie project, and his fascination with planes. This film, although spanning just under 3 hours, is a nail-biter all the way. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat, with a great performance by Dicaprio and cast, that comes alive on screen. This film may not be one of the best to come out this year in theaters, but it is a step up from recent big budget releases to hit this Christmas season. The film is definitely worth the money to be seen, and don't worry about the 3 hour run time, it will breeze on by in a flash."

This guy can really act. It's about time that he receives the accolades due to him. He has paid his dues with this one. Cate Blanchett was stunning as well as convincing in her role as Kathrine Hepburn. The costumes were breath taking, the sets were impeccable in detail. Scorcesse doesn't scrimp on the budget for these elements. I found the story a little confusing in the opening scenes. It did jump around a bit but Leonardo held it together with his talent for not skipping a beat in the dialogue. With a life story as massive as Howard Hughes, it is impossible to do much of anything except skim over the highlights. One of the things a movie does is generate interest in the subject matter. It definitely does that....or I wouldn't be on this site. I saw Ray, and Jamie Foxx did an impressive impersonation. The comparison of acting vs. impersonations is evident in these two roles. Based on that theory alone, I would vote DiCaprio over Foxx. Fine line yes, and both bios are good.....I'm just glad I'm not a member of the Academy. Finding Neverland shows Friday night. That will probably put me over the top."
"gregsrants","9","5","15","19 December 2004"," Scorsese and DiCaprio back on track
","'And the winner of this year's Academy Award for Best Director is.Martin Scorsese' <br/><br/>Why not? After all, he has been nominated five times before. Adored by critics and hailed as one of this generations finest film helmers, Marty has yet to walk to the podium to accept his due. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck has one. Eminem has one. So why not in the same year that saw Phil Mickelson finally whip his own demons and walk away with a Master's Championship, and the Boston Red Sox overcome the Curse of the Bambino, should Martin Scorsese not be able to put a lifetime of film-making into an honor that has him take home the coveted golden statuette. <br/><br/>Martin's 2004 crack at the can comes courtesy of The Aviator, a film that chronicles the life of movie director and multi-millionaire aviator, Howard Hughes. For any of us that have seen an E! True Hollywood Story or A&E Biography on the eccentric Mr. Hughes, they would most remember his final years. He became a paranoid recluse that bordered on the insane. <br/><br/>But Scorsese only dabbles in Hughes final years and the slow deterioration of this playboy's exile. Instead, he shows what a shrewd businessman and compulsive obsessive aviator Hughes was in his younger years and how he single handedly, due to either his genius or incredible stubbornness, didn't allow Pan Am to buy his Trans World Airlines to create a one-airline option for the American public. <br/><br/>Playing the role as the anomalous Howard Hughes is Leonardo DiCarpio in his second collaboration with Scorsese in as many years (Gangs of New York). I have written for almost five years now how I have not understood the DiCarpio fascination. He was just OK in good films  Titanic, Catch Me If You Can  but gawd-awful in movies that he could have elevated  The Beach, The Man in The Iron Mask. Before The Aviator was even viewed for critics, DiCaprio was garnishing nominations as Best Actor and his salary intake based on one monster making film and countless teen magazines was just mind-blowing to me. Until now.<br/><br/>As Howard, Leo does his best work to date and any non-nomination by the Academy would be robbery. This will be the role that defines DiCaprio. A role where he plays both a man with a vision and a child that locks himself in a room in self quarantine. As a naked Hughes in his red screening room, he drinks copious amounts of milk, lines up his bottles of urine and fends off an aggressive takeover bid by Pan Am's Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). It is a scene upon which the succeeding chapters strongly rely and in the hands of a less talented actor, could have turned the movie into parody. But DiCaprio turns it into gold and although we are not talking about Tom Hanks type consistency yet, we definitely have seen a maturity that leads to as much more promise than say Gangs of New York did just one year ago.<br/><br/>Clocking in at an unnecessary 169 minutes, the movie's first quarter focuses on the making of Hughes' film Hell's Angels from 1927 to 1930. The film was a visually stunning epic, which before production wrapped, buried three stunt men, was shot twice to incorporate the new innovation of sound in motion pictures and came in at a cost of almost $4 million. Sure that type of money might not even pay for Bruce Willis' baggage handler in today's economics, but back in 1930, it was almost 4 times the cost of the average big screen production. This lavish spending on a film that that would be almost impossible to recuperate, brings Noah Dietrich (always reliable John C. Reilly) into Hughes life as his financial voice of reason and head of Hughes' inherited tools manufacturing business. Together, these two would meet on screen throughout the years as Hughes would always be looking for money to fulfill his dreams while looking to Dietrich to find the money.<br/><br/>After the opening of Hell's Angels, the movie begins to take a turn and follow the two loves of Hughes' life  aviation and women. In his aviation career, Hughes was a perfectionist that garnished grants from the government during wartime to build an airplane to better provide troops and equipment overseas. The plane, nicknamed the 'Spruce Goose' was completed after the war ended and was never used for its wartime intention. And as his empire grew, Hughes also started Trans World Airlines and began the quest of traveling to Europe and beyond. This would consume Hughes in his later years as conspirators in both rival airlines and the government tried desperately to dissipate his dreams.<br/><br/>When it came to women, Hughes was labeled 'The World's Greatest Womanizer' back in the 1950's, but it was his love for Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) that the film reveals most prominently. They had a tumultuous relationship where fame and pressure would ultimately be their demise. But that didn't stop Hughes from putting a lovely woman on his arm each time he went out on the town. Hughes was attached to Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow and various times during his adult life and was the Scott Baio of their times. <br/><br/>The last few chapters of the film deal with Hughes battle with government and his own internal demons as he edges into a world of insanity. This was an important footnote in the life of this public celebrity, but Scorsese probably draws it out 20 minutes more than is necessary. <br/><br/>When the film is over, it is hard not to be overwhelmed with the contributions Hughes made to the future in both film-making and aviation. Without his battles with the government airlines like Southwest and Continental might never have ran a tarmac and he pushed the envelope with such violent or sexual in nature films as Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw (1941) that caused the MPAA to review its processes. <br/><br/>The Aviator will lead the nominations parade throughout 2005. Scorsese, DiCaprio and Best Picture are all strong possibilities and rightfully so. The Aviator was a step back in the right direction for both director and lead actor and was one of the top 10 of 2005.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"
"charmingnotion","10","4","11","27 December 2004"," Best Movie I've Seen In A Long Time
","I've been very excited about seeing The Aviator for quite a while, and today I finally got the chance to do so! Its the best movie of 2004, no doubt about it! Its simply brilliant! Everything about it was great, the cast, costumes, sets, just everything. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives his best performance so far. He does a fabulous job as Howard Hughes, his performance is intense, and mature, proving that he has enormous talent. He has definitely proved that he is one of Amercias greatest actors. He really nails the role, and even puts thought into the smallest details. He deserves an Oscar for his wonderful performance. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett gives a simply marvelous performance as the legendary Katharine Hepburn. Her performance is not an imitation, you really believe that she is Katharine Hepburn for 3 hours. When I first heard that Cate Blanchett was going to play Katharine (one of my favorite actress's) I was very skeptical, thinking that she looked nothing like Kate. I was wrong,very very wrong, she doesn't look that much like Katharine but she masters her mannerisms and voice, and is totally believable. She and Leo have great chemistry together as well. I have no doubt in my mind that she will win an Oscar, she is more than deserving. <br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale also does a great job playing the beautiful Ava Gardner, who has a very love/hate relationship with Hughes. She comes and goes in the film, but when she is there, she does a wonderful job. She does a wonderful job of portraying a woman who sometimes hates, but ultimately loves Howard.<br/><br/>Scorsese is one of the best directors today and he too deserves Oscar gold. Despite the films 3 hours, it never once drags, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The movie should and hopefully will win the Best Picture Oscar. I went into the theater today hoping for a great movie, but the Aviator isn't just a great movie, its a masterpiece"
"Padeye","8","4","11","26 December 2004"," It worked for me
","This movie was more than I expected, particularly from Lenonardo DiCaprio. It's taken me a while to warm to him as a serious actor in adult roles but I think he's grown a lot in the past few years. I thought he inhabited Hughes' character quite well but that may be because I don't expect actors in biopics to do impersonations. Impersonation is what some people do if they can't act. An even better example is Cate Blanchett's Katharine Hepburn. I think she nailed the character squarely but perhaps some people might disagree because they've been numbed by Martin Short's palsy voiced rendition.<br/><br/>Interesting to note that this is Martin Scorsese's first FX heavy movie so I'll gladly overlook a few technical gaffes (sorry, but I'm an aviation buff) but I'm glad to see that the effects didn't overwhelm the characters."

","John Logan wrote the script for this film study of the late Howard Hughes. Under the skillful direction of Martin Scorsese, this movie is thereafter called "" The Aviator. "" It is the bio-Pic of one of the wealthiest, controversial, influential and certainly most flamboyant magnate of the 30's, 40's and 50s'. The son of an oil industrialist who left him an oil and drill bit company which he further expanded into a huge fortune, he further managed to increase its' holdings many times. Later, Howard Hughes became synonymous with early movies which challenged the Hays Code and brought America such stars as Jane Russel. During the same span of years, Hughes became afflicted with a debilitating ailment called O.C.D. or Osbessive Compulsive Disorder. However, his superior efforts also brought him world recognition as well as disastrous influence over many who saw him as a man out of control and a disturbing paranoid mania for cleanliness and perfection. In this film, the cast which features, Leonardo DiCaprio, is superior as he plays the eccentric Howard Hughes, with Cate Blanchett doing a superb job as Katharine Hepburn. Other cast members include Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm and Jude Law. The movie is a fast paced ride from Boyhood to reclusive tycoon and each triumph is matched only by the equally strange behaviors which find him isolated in small hotel room afflicted by Allodynia. Still, the director has placed this film in the Annals of the Classics and I have to agree. ****"
"Jerominator","10","2","4","3 July 2013"," A study of an extra-ordinary man tormented by an unknown condition
","I remember my older brother calling me ""Howard Hughes"" when I was younger because I apparently washed my hands too much. I just wrote it off along with all the other name-calling you come to expect at that age. Hell, I didn't even know who Howard Hughes was anyway!<br/><br/>30 years later, I watched this film and it left a sour taste in my mouth. I noticed some similarities between some problems I'd been experiencing and what I was witnessing on the screen. I tried to find out what Hughes's affliction was, but couldn't find any correlation, so I left it at that.<br/><br/>Long story short, 6 months ago I discovered that I have OCD and have been coming to terms with it since then. The hysterical irony of it all is that a book I've been reading about treating OCD states that it is now widely believed Mr Hughes's affliction was OCD, a fact sadly absent from the previous research I'd done. So I guess everything comes full circle and I should've listened to my brother after all!<br/><br/>Living in a world where OCD didn't exist and you were either ""normal"" or ""crazy"", Hughes must have experienced a very special kind of private hell. Forget Melvin Udall in ""As Good as it Gets"" with his lovable quirks & snappy one liners; think more along the lines of a secret nightmare that constantly has you asking ""why me?"" and redefining the meaning of humiliation and loss. The cruelest aspect is that the harder you try to fight or control it, the more potent it becomes, until you find yourself trapped in inescapable cycles of abhorrent behaviour that you hate but cannot stop, which can consume whole days at a time, which can ultimately consume your life. So if you take a determined young tycoon circa early 20th century and gift him with OCD, well you'll probably end up with Howard Hughes's life.<br/><br/>Now I wouldn't expect any movie studio to fund a film that accurately depicted OCD. There would simply be too much strange & upsetting behaviour and it would be unwatchable for most. So I'm impressed Scorcese managed to include as much about it as he did here. Brave choice.<br/><br/>Quite possibly Dicaprio's best role to date, and I include J. Edgar, The Departed, Revolutionary Road and Shutter Island in that. Just the range of expression and emotion, much of it unspoken and under the surface. Assuming DiCaprio doesn't have OCD, it must have been hard to mimic with a total absence of the underlying mental processes that drive it. So he did a hell of a job. Incorporated into his performance was also the noticeable transition from youth into man, as well as a traumatised post accident Hughes. It wasn't all eccentric/OCD behaviour though, he allowed some of Hughes's non-OCD charm & personality to shine through which was a realistic touch. DiCaprio not getting best actor for this is as laughable as Cruise not getting it for ""Born on the Fourth of July"". A fine supporting cast including very believable scheming vipers from Baldwin and Alda.<br/><br/>The effects are absolutely stunning. Yes, I appreciate that the CGI is already dated but I personally don't get hung up on that stuff and I think it all still looks fantastic. The recreation of the aeroplanes and aerial sequences were exquisitely done. Likewise, the care that went into the set design and location scouting for the art deco clubs, offices, homes and washrooms gave this story the backdrop it deserved. In fact the work that went into wardrobe, makeup, furniture, and styling played a huge part in retelling this grand story properly. All this combined with the use of lavish colour breathed new life into a forgotten world, usually only viewed through a distorted monochrome or sepia lens.<br/><br/>My only dislike here was Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. The Hepburn I remember from the movies was charming, vibrant and attractive. This Hepburn however was garish on the eye and awkwardly caricatured in speech. I suppose Kate Mulgrew(Star Trek Voyager) may have been a little too old to pull it off but she would have been an absolutely perfect choice otherwise. Now please don't get me wrong - Blanchett is clearly a very capable actress under normal circumstances and 11 out of 10 to her for effort. That's not the point though - what was required here wasn't acting, but an accurate impersonation and she was horribly miscast. This is a forgivable hiccup in a grand masterpiece though.<br/><br/>I thought it was testament to Scorcese's respect for Hughes that he made a point of showing how Pan Am and its political shills conspired to publicly destroy Hughes in an attempt to monopolise the airline game. This last portion of the film could *so easily* have been a freakshow about Hughes's descent into isolation or speculation about how he lived out his final years - it's the obvious crowd-pleasing move. We all know that in reality his life didn't end happily but this vindication and the flight of the Hercules reminds us that he did achieve some things he set out to do and wasn't quite the vilified freak they wanted us to believe he was. Classy touch that I thought.<br/><br/>All in all this is about as grand a picture as you'll get to see nowadays in terms of sets, resources, effects, acting, and recapturing a by gone age.<br/><br/>Seriously - the amount of research, work and attention to detail that must've gone into this masterpiece might have impressed even Hughes himself.<br/><br/>I have nothing but respect for Scorcese bringing this very difficult story to the screen with so much care, attention to detail and style. OK, so I guess I have a personal stake in this story but I still think it would be a disservice giving this anything less than 10 stars."

","I admired this for its high production values but was disappointed that it is pitched more as an entertainment than as providing any insights into Howard Hughes the man. One test I have for film biographies is whether I get more understanding from the film than reading a Wikipedia article. This movie failed that test for me, since it did not give me any better understanding of Hughes than I had before seeing it. Hughes had an interesting career and personal life with many irons in the fire in both spheres. Maybe his life is too rich to be covered in a single movie that can go beyond hitting the high points of his work in movies, his aviation achievements, and more than a hint of his romances.<br/><br/>Leonard DiCaprio gives it his best, but I feel he did not capture the essence of the man. In any archival footage of Hughes that I have seen he evinces a charisma and intelligence that I did not get from DiCaprio's performance. I found Hughes was presented here as rather one-dimensional, always barking orders and instructing his assistant to mortgage everything to support his current passion. Hughes wound up as one of the wealthiest men in the United States, but I never got a feel from this movie as to how he amassed his fortune--he had to be more of a cunning businessman than what we are given here. As much as I like Cate Blanchett, I found her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn created more of a caricature than a character. She got close on the voice, but I have to believe that Hepburn was a more serious person than the flippant and shallow person created. Best for Scorsese that Hepburn never saw this movie as I am sure she would have ripped him to shreds. Alan Alda, as U.S. Senator Brewster, is the only actor whose performance engaged me. The battle of egos between Brewster and Hughes provided a spark, missing in most other scenes.<br/><br/>Hints of the obsessive compulsive disorder that was to ravage Hughes in later life are dropped along the way, like his wanting his peas served in a 4x4 matrix and being upset when someone disturbed the symmetry. I found it curious that nobody ever directly addressed this, either to Hughes or to friends, early on. I think that most people who saw a friend behaving this way would be concerned and bring it up as odd enough to be of concern long before the sickness reached a level where it could no longer be ignored.<br/><br/>There are some spectacular shots of planes of the era. The scene where Hughes crashed an XF-11 into a Los Angeles neighborhood is rendered in harrowing detail. The mock-up of the Spruce Goose (which in fact was made primarily of birch) was wonderfully realized.<br/><br/>I quickly tired of the exaggeration for effect, like Hughes burning all his clothes on the floor of his house and letting Hepburn fly his plane over Los Angeles at night when she had never flown before. The scenes in the nightclub were so amped up in order to create a sense of chaos and frenzy that they were unbelievable, capped off by a band leader who was ridiculously gesticulating like a mad man.<br/><br/>This is a passable entertainment, but disappointing, given the effort put into it and the fact that it comes from Scorsese."

","OK, well I had waited a long time to see this film and I didn't really have any expectations, apart from the fact that it's directed by Scorsese. The direction is good, a little prosaic but serviceable; what I find incredible is that Cate Blanchett won a best supporting actress Oscar for this - she's terrible. Hammy and not even proficient at ""doing"" Katharine Hepburn. I didn't know whether to laugh at her performance or to cry that this type of hack job is rewarded with an Oscar. Kate Beckinsale on the other hand as Ava Gardner is miles better, stunning to look at and with a genuine fire that made me think, Yes, this is a quality that made this woman tick. Leonardo DiCaprio is fine as Hughes, nothing special, just fine. He's a good but not a great actor, he lacks a certain magic, a certain uniqueness that would make him more than just average. I found myself wondering what Sean Penn would have been like in the role..."

","The Aviator is a film that had terrific potential to tell a compelling story, but the potential was unrecognized.<br/><br/>The usually bullet proof Martin Scorsese ultimately disappointed with this feature. I'm not certain where exactly he went wrong, but it almost seemed to me that halfway through the film, it was as if he gave up.<br/><br/>The acting is fine & the art direction is wonderful, but somewhere throughout the process of shooting this film, the story becomes bogged down and seems to be stuck in quick sand.<br/><br/>Attempting to tell the story of the super eccentric Howard Hughes and his love for flight, obviously proved to be too much for Marty to handle. There were scenes that were done well and quite interesting, but in a moment, large amounts of time passes to get to the next scene which not only confuses the viewer, but brings us to a moment in Howard's life that if far from interesting or captivating. In short, the interesting, key parts of the film were too short and scenes that were not needed were far too long. This seemed to be the norm throughout the film.<br/><br/>In closing, by the end of this movie, there was still plenty of story that should have been told, as I have an interest in Howard Hughes and his life. For people who were not familiar with him who saw the movie, I think they got a raw deal and were short changed."

","Sorry but i was very disappointed watching this movie. I know the story of this great man called Howard Hughes and this movie doesn't tell the right story of this very special and complex character. Di Caprio is not the right man to perform this movie. There are better actors out there who could do it much better... There is a big leak in fact about the real live of Howard Hughes. The movie doesn't tell absolutely nothing about whats happening after he was test flying the plane, that he went into the Helicopter business etc, etc. This movie likes a typical Hollywood action stuff for teenagers. Scorsese, you can do much better!! I am a fan of Skorsese but this thing is not worth to watch. I hope some day somebody will make a real biography of this great man with real fact! Why the movie does not show nothing about his flight to Europe and round the world?? Instead watching how he is cleaning his hands over and over again, pissing in milk bottles, stupid nude scenes etc.. I can't understand why so many Oscars??"
"marlyly","6","2","4","4 October 2008"," Watch this more for learning than for entertainment
","Before watching this film I knew nothing about Howard Hughes, about aviation, had no idea what this film was about other than a biography, when it was set, had never even seen a trailer. Yet, I had heard many positive reviews and curious to see what all the fuss was about I finally got around to watching the film, and was not disappointed I did.<br/><br/>As I said before, I knew nothing previously about Howard Hughes so this film was interesting to me just to find out about the man, about his eccentricities, his obsession with perfection, his his constant strive towards the future. Leonardo DiCaprio was believable (though how similar he was to the real Howard Hughes I cannot comment), as was Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn (in fact, I'd say Blanchett's performance was some of the best acting I have seen in a long time).<br/><br/>The film isn't exciting, fun, it doesn't even capture the viewer and keep them enthralled in the story. It is long, and I often began to think 'is this film actually going ANYHWERE?' but it is worth a watch, especially if you're interesting in Howard Hughes, or if not, if you enjoy biographical films, or even interested in Hollywood at the time. I'm glad I watched it purely to find out about the man, but it is dark, and will leave viewers with a dark feeling looming over them, and I don't think I'd like to watch it again in a hurry. It is a brave film, some of the scenes seemed incredibly risky but were pulled off well, but there isn't really much more to say - I won't rave and say it was one of the best things I've ever watched, because it isn't, but it does deserve recognition (far more than it's had if I'm honest) and is a good piece of work. Give it a go, just don't expect to be overwhelmed."

","Considering he is often heralded as one of the finest directors ever to work in Hollywood, I find it rather surprising to discover that my experience with Martin Scorsese is embarrassingly limited. Outside of his all-time classics {'Taxi Driver (1976),' 'Raging Bull (1980)'}, the enjoyable 'The King of Comedy (1983)' and the interesting but uneven 'Gangs of New York (2002),' I had seen very little from the famed director. 'The Aviator (2004)' was a film about which I was very enthusiastic, as glossy biopics are a favourite sub-genre of mine, and its success at the 2005 Academy Awards {5 wins from 11 nominations} suggested that this film was a type specimen. Unfortunately, Scorsese's biopic of Howard Hughes proves a bit too ""glossy"" for its own good, though there are certainly multiple moments of brilliance amid the fast-moving 170 minutes of skyward drama. Leonardo DiCaprio, finally breaking free of that ""baby-faced"" persona that had clung to him throughout his career, is impeccable as notorious film producer, aviator and billionaire, whose mental deterioration and descent into reclusiveness is well-documented in history.<br/><br/>'The Aviator' opens in 1927, with a young Howard Hughes directing his first ambitious motion picture, the epic war-time aviation drama, 'Hell's Angels (1930)' {a film that I'm now determined to track down}. Despite countless setbacks, and an expanding budget that stretches into the millions, Hughes is determined to complete his film, whatever the cost. It is in these opening scenes that 'The Aviator' truly hits its stride, and the remainder of the film struggles to keep up; being a director himself, Scorsese obviously delights in retelling an epic film-making tale, and some slick {if not entirely convincing} visual effects help to capture the sheer majesty of Hughe's vision Â– I think that it would have been even more charming for the film to have created these aerial scenes using the same tools that were available in the 1920s {however, there were obvious safety considerations, considering three pilots died during the making of 'Hell's Angels'}. The remainder of the film concerns Hughes' fascination with aviation, his company's tussle with Pan American Airlines, his various female liaisons, and his struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder.<br/><br/>Though he is still perhaps too young to correctly portray a man reaching his forties, Leonardo DiCaprio {in his second collaboration with Scorsese} is excellent in the film's leading role, successfully capturing Hughes' eccentric personality and his OCD-afflicted symptoms. Of course, the film is arguably stolen by Cate Blanchett {in an Oscar-winning role}, who faultlessly channels the spirit of Katharine Hepburn, mimicking her well-recognised tone of voice, mannerisms and general demeanour. Kate Beckinsale {Ava Gardner}, Gwen Stefani {Jean Harlow} and Jude Law {Errol Flynn} also do their best at playing popular Hollywood figures, but these three pale in comparison with Blanchett's epic portrayal. Also memorable in 'The Aviator' are John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, and especially Alan Alda {of TV's ""M*A*S*H""}, who plays a senator allegedly in the pocket of Howard Hughes' greatest rival, Pan Am owner Juan Trippe."
"classicsoncall","9","2","4","10 November 2007"," ""There's too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes.""
","Watching the film today for the first time, I found myself fascinated by it, but not for the reasons I thought I would be. As a teenager in the 1960's, I was aware of this character named Howard Hughes, the billionaire recluse who made a vast fortune in the aviation business. What I wasn't aware of, nor was the rest of the world, is that Hughes spent a lifelong battle against mental illness following the tragic crash of one of his experimental airplanes. I don't recall ever reading about or hearing a reference to his Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder, which made the revelation in the film to be so intriguing and fascinating. Though the film glossed over his personal relationships while he was going through this, I really wonder what it must have been like for his close friends and business associates to see him go through this agony.<br/><br/>When I first heard about Leonardo DiCaprio's casting as Hughes, I thought to myself 'no way', that doesn't even make sense. Watching the movie, it still didn't make sense, until I watched a documentary about Hughes showing him in clips from the era in question, the late 1920's to the late 1940's. Back then, Hughes didn't even look like Hughes, at least the Hughes that I can remember from newspaper photos during the late 1960's. In the scenes that depict the man's descent into madness, DiCaprio appears to transform into a reasonable facsimile of the aging, reclusive genius. Anyway, not being particularly a DiCaprio fan, I thought he did an excellent job in his portrayal, a tribute to his exhaustive research into the life of his subject.<br/><br/>I don't pretend to know anything about the filming techniques involved in producing this movie, but I thought it unique the way it opens with a bluish/aqua cast to the scenes for a good part of the first half. At first it was somewhat distracting, especially during the dinner scene with the blue peas, but later I learned it was meant to simulate the Technicolor process available at that time in Hughes' life. As the movie progresses, it takes on a more realistic color rendition, director Scorsese's bold way of marking movie-making progress through the years.<br/><br/>I suppose I should mention Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. It only took hearing a couple of sentences to realize that she sounded dead on for the late star, while capturing the look and mannerisms in an eerily accurate way. There has always been something just out of reach for me in trying to understand why I didn't like Hepburn as a person. With Blanchett's portrayal, I now know why, and I think it has to do with what Hughes figured out. She seemed to be acting out her life instead of living it.<br/><br/>For Hughes fans interested in the aviation side of the story, there's a lot of that too. I was particularly impressed with the inventor's clear vision for the future of commercial air travel, and the depiction of the rivalry against Pan-Am President Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). The tense scene during the Senate hearings conducted by Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) was nearly identical to the real thing from a news clip I viewed of the actual event.<br/><br/>On balance, I'd have to say that watching the film was an entirely worthwhile experience on a number of levels. Entertaining it was for sure, but I came away with a much better understanding and appreciation for a legendary character that many will only know as a name in history. Kudos to all involved with this project, which manages to be entirely absorbing, even to the smallest detail."
"wisewebwoman","7","2","4","11 December 2006"," A bowl of oatmeal
","And I'll explain that - it is like every flake of Howard Hughes's life was tossed into a bowl and regurgitated haphazardly. For one, his OCD is shown in extremis through parts of the film (he lives naked, surrounded by tissues and bottles of his own urine) and yet he is able to drag himself together and appear coherently in front of a Senate hearing.<br/><br/>Yes, I would buy there were tiny signs of his disorder early in his life, but it was not full blown until the last decade.<br/><br/>I didn't like Leonardo in the part, he is too much of a one-note actor to handle the complexity, sexiness, power and drive of the Hughes character. DiCaprio is too slight in every way. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn needed a more tenacious grip on her character, her accent and mannerisms were too inconsistent, but then again she was playing off the anorexic performance of DiCaprio.<br/><br/>The time-lines were completely out of whack, one example: Katharine leaving Howard for Spencer? No.<br/><br/>Ava Gardiner was seriously miscast as well, if anyone has caught her in one of her incredible film performances you will know what I mean, she is woefully ill-served here.<br/><br/>Some of these larger than life heroes need a story that will reflect their magnetism and the reality of their lives and with more care taken to the details that are often anachronistic and irritating in attempts such as these. (Example being the opening mommy hygiene scene which is used to back-story his OCD, please, we're not quite that gullible!!) A shame. Some of the bigger scenes are truly wonderful, the scene within the Cocoanut Grove being one of them, the busy backlots and the CGI scenes of the flights being a few more. Also the music was captivating. And marvellous cinematography. Howard was poorly served here. Perhaps the casting of a George Clooney type might have helped. We needed to see the power and complexity. 7 out of 10 for such a big attempt to diminish such a huge character."

","The early life of billionaire flier and racist (not tackled for box office reasons!) oddball Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>There are some people whose name comes with a built in full stop. A moment to pause while you think of all those things they did, achieved or represented. Howard Hughes is one such case, but you cannot rank him up with the great visionaries or the great eccentrics like Einstein, Van Gough or Michael Angelo - these people mixed talent with their madness. As director Martin Scorsese is forced to admit (after the entertaining crash-bang has ended) - most of the things that HH came up with didn't work or couldn't work.<br/><br/>(Jane Russell never wore the bra he designed for her over-sized breasts - a point that the film skirts around.) <br/><br/>Hughes took the money of his (far more brilliant) father and while entertaining with it - didn't spend too much time at school learning the basic rules of flying or film making (you try sitting through anything other than Hells Angels). However with money you can buy your own trophies and good PR- and Hughes had very deep pockets.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese revisits some of his greatest hits and greatest flops in this movie. The long drawn out entrance to a night-club from Goodfellas and the souped-up camp of New York, New York: When you to any night-club in a film you can be sure that every extra will look like a professional dancer and the main players will smoke/drink (although Hughes didn't) and exchange loaded barbs. Amazing how witty the whole world is in films! <br/><br/>Leo DiCaprio has an unfortunate face. He is destined to look 15 until late middle age and you can't do a thing about it. Stick all the fluff you want on his face and then add a bottle of hair grease and he still looks like he has stepped out of Buggsy Malone. He is not a bad actor (and getting better) but no one can claim he was cast for anything other than box office. Worse Martin Scorsese uses lighting to try and bring gravitas to his unconvincing appearance. He is just miscast and that is the end of it.<br/><br/>Katherine Hepburn (here played by Cate Blanchett: Deserved as Oscar? I'm not sure!) had no taste in men. She liked to be the superior partner is her relationships so she chose oddballs, broke artists and addicts. Maybe these were the few men she didn't scare away. Hughes had money and toys and while it is presented here as some central relationship (Hughes treated all women as if they could be bought, sold or exchanged) it was nothing of the sort. Spencer Tracy was one of Americas greatest actors but also a chronic and incurable alcoholic. In him she found her ideal match!<br/><br/>Madness is hard to capture on film. It is often not a level dip. It can come and go, get worse, get better, even be effected by the weather. No one has a clue if it is was two planes crashes (there might have been more) or some disease that took HH out of circulation. Clifford Irving thought Hughes was too mad to dispute his fake autobiography (not featured here) but he pulled himself together. Even from his self-made lunatic asylum bed! <br/><br/>It is good to see that Scoresese is back on something like form after a string of so-so efforts. Despite the money he is given to spend on props the quality of actor isn't around to pull this kind of thing off. Too many dough boys with plastic teeth and empty eyes. Without these bricks nobody - and I mean nobody - can make an engrossing classic film. All you can come up with is pretty backdrops and sweeping scores and hope nobody notices the lack of major talent in the speaking parts."

He had that s**t cracking to a T. Everything about his portrayal was perfect. In my opinion, I think he is tied with Jamie Foxx for the acting category because there were no flaws in his acting. It was completely smooth. Katherine Hepburn is proudly looking down on Cate Blanchett because of her portrayal of her. Blanchlett stole the first half of the movie. She was absolutely awesome. I liked how she screamed out ""Golly"" during the scene where they flew a plane together LOL. It was really great. Since when did Alan Alda from M.A.S.H turn into such an a**hole.

The choice of Leonardo Di Caprio to play Howard Hughes seemed logical for the first scenes when Hughes was in his 20s but as he progresses into his 30s and 40s Di Caprio cannot shake off those boyish young looks taking away much of the believability and his constant forced furrowed brow really bugged me. I wanted to yell ""Leo stop squinting!"" Cate Blanchett i found interesting and her slight over caricature of Kate Hepburn didn't bother me. John C. Reilly (always on top form) and the use of Technicolour for the scenes set in the 30s is ambitious as is some of the cinematography.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we learn little about Hughes which for a biopec is pretty pointless. We don't get any insight to how his parents founded his empire, how much he was actually worth, why he suffered from mental illness and compulsive cleanliness or what inspired him to become a visionary engineer. In the end the story just waaayy toooo slooooow and i reverted to forwarding past the boring conversations in the hope of something interesting...it never came.

","My wife and I just watched this movie on cable with great expectations. Wow! How many ways can one be disappointed in a movie? The biographical aspects of the story were more supermarket tabloid than History Channel.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Blanchett must have talent, because almost everyone liked them in Titanic, and this movie has had great acclaim also, but I don't see it in either movie. In Titanic, they played two-dimensional stereotypes with such a predictable uninteresting story line, that I found myself looking for the iceberg 20 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>In The Aviator, DiCaprio and Blanchette seemed to me to be playing caricatures--not characters. Maybe it's the writing, but I did not care about anyone in this movie, with the possible exception of the Alan Alda character, Senator Brewster--who was played just low-key and unscrupulous enough to be believable...so I hated him.<br/><br/>Casting. In spite of the obvious effort he put forth, I just cannot see DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. I think I might have cast Gary Sinise in that part. As to Katherine Hepburn, playing that part is like playing Superman--a lose-lose opportunity. Played straight, you say, ""She didn't sound anything like Hepburn."" Played as Blanchett did, it seemed more like stand-up comedy than movie drama. Alan Alda was perfect--no stereotype crooked politician mannerisms, no tired old-time movie politician expressions. Alec Baldwin is easy casting for a villain. Since so many people dislike Alec Baldwin anyway, it is easy to dislike his character.<br/><br/>Writing. I've already commented on the 2D characters. The other thing I consider unacceptable in a period movie is modern day expressions. Maybe, like the DiCaprio-Blanchett paring, this is to appeal to young audiences, but personally I find it distracting and consider it lazy writing and still another historical inaccuracy. If you are going to write a screenplay about a time other than now, take the time to learn the language of the era.<br/><br/>Good special effects. I enjoyed the aircraft scenes. My wife found them boring. I have to file this movie with Titanic, Pearl Harbor, and War of the Worlds under, ""It's too bad that someone doesn't put a good story with these modern effects when they retell an old story or remake an old movie."" If you want to see a better movie about Howard Hughes, find ""The Amazing Howard Hughes"" a TV movie from the 70's based on the book by Noah Dietrich. Best yet, read the book."

","The critics panned it, the audiences stayed away, the Academy didn't give it it's due - all in all ""The Aviator"" was a theater-goer's disappointment all around. So maybe I'm a sucker for a beautiful period-piece or maybe I just don't know a stinker when I see it, but I say that ""The Aviator"" was a superb film that I will watch again & again.<br/><br/>Scorsese has made some mediocre movies (Gangs of New York & New York, New York come to mind) but this isn't one of them. The casting was brilliant, the cinematography inspired (watch how certain scenes of different time-periods have a ""vintage"" cinematic look to them), the music fabulous and the acting spot-on. For those who thought DiCaprio was too ""baby-faced"" or too young to play Hughes, take a look at a few Hughes photographs from the 30's and you will see that he was not the more rugged looking fellow from after his near-fatal plane crash. The baby-face works here and lends even more to the realism that DiCaprio gives to his portrayal of HH.<br/><br/>I was captivated by Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Kate Hepburn as well as Kate Beckinsale's portrayal of Ava Gardner. Both actresses did a bang-up job of giving their characters a panache and fire that would have been necessary to match them against such a formidable lover and opponent as Hughes was to these two paramours. I was disappointed, however, that there was no mention made of Hughes' well known bisexuality and his alleged connection to the murder of rumored lover David Bacon (of The Masked Marvel serial movie fame). This could have been a great side story and I feel it was an opportunity missed by the screenwriters & the director.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie I will list in my personal top 20 and once I own the DVD will watch over & over just as I do Tombstone, Titanic, Malcolm X & Wyatt Earp. If you haven't seen it because of the negative comments here or those given by critics at it's release give ""The Aviator"" an opportunity to captivate you. If you've seen it but disliked it because it's not an ""action-packed-thriller"" watch it again and make note of the fabulous sets, the wonderful cinematography, the music and the dead-on portrayal of Hughes by Leonardo DiCaprio. And for heaven's sake if for nothing else watch it for the slick flying and aviation engineering history lesson.<br/><br/>This film is definitely a winner in my book!"

","Much of this film didn't make sense until I watched some of the associated documentaries on the second features DVD. Now I see that many of the scenes are recreations of documented events in Hughes' life.<br/><br/>Visually the film is attractive and DiCaprio does a credible job of living the role, but there is little plot or story and overall it tends to drag. I'm fascinated by planes and the history of aviation, so halfway through the film I was surprised to find I was completely uninvolved with this narrative. The story wakes up a little during the congressional hearings, with DiCaprio sparring against Alda - just sufficiently to keep me hanging on to the end."
"tobornot2wew82c","6","2","4","5 August 2005"," A Jumble, just like its subject - Howierd Hughes
","I would not have seen this film if my wife had not bought it on the sly. My prejudice is based on a personal bias against the Star, the person (Hughes) represented, the State where our man was born, and the Director. Armed with this sort of informed doubt, I am seldom burdened with a dud movie. We have a large collection of DVD releases, a small house, and limited storage space. Any addition to the collection has to be good enough to bump some earlier selection out to the Thrift Store shelves. In other words, to earn a place on our shelf, a film has to be a convincing WINNER and BETTER than something else already there. So, it was with misgivings that I agreed to sit through ""The Aviator"". So, I did. My wife loved it (or, the Kate Hepburn part). I hated it, all of it.<br/><br/>It would have been sufficient for the director to simply state that ""HH"" inherited much more money than he deserved and got on with the business of playing with it. And, with anything else that came his way. The ending could have come next but that was somewhere in the muddle (er, middle) just before ""HH"" leaped out of bed and raced to the Government Hearings to protect his good name. Our man was really upset when he divined somehow that he was not believed and that made him a liar! (""...I am not, nor I have been, A LIAR!..."") Hmm, reminds me of Nixon telling us he was not a crook. Onward.<br/><br/>(In fairness, ""HH"" was quoted as saying that other companies had signed contracts to deliver defensive weapons that became obsolete with the end of World War II. Furthermore, those companies had not delivered unwanted weapons. How short sighted he was - we still see some of those aircraft flying around to this day. We could use some more of them, too. Forest fires, don't you know?) Well, ""HH"" hocked the farm to get TWA (Teeny Weenie Airlines?) off the ground. This was interesting. It seems that there really was a bad guy after all. The U.S. Government. NO! That was Juan Trippe, president of Pan American Airways. All that fellow wanted was a monopoly of passenger business everywhere. Sheese! Another Henry Ford/John Rockefeller. ""HH"" resented that fellow.<br/><br/>I grew up about 3 miles from the Hughes Aircraft factory over near Loyola College; I heard about the ""Spruce Goose"" but never had a glimpse of it - did not see it moved by truck - did not see it taxi and do wind sprints out in the Harbor - Saw the huge hangar where it sat for decades. I never even got into the geodesic tomb built for it in later years. - Just heard a lot about it. I do remember that ""HH"" and a crew of dozens (3 to 5 per engine) drove it out into the Harbor and ran it back and forth and that he actually lifted it out of the water for a short run. Local press derided him for not getting it up further - we were all disappointed. Not in the movie, however. There he gooooooooeeeeesssssss!!!!!! Yay! I finally caught up with it in McMinnville, Oregon in 1995. It was sitting in a parking lot, not assembled yet. Phooey. (""HH"" also built a huge helicopter for some reason.) Where were we? Oh yes, ""The Aviator"". The special scenes showing the crash of the TurboProp showed the right wing slicing through the wall of a house that must have been a thousand feet long and all built from rice paper. Yes, ""HH"" was lucky. And obnoxious. The film did nothing to correct our impressions of him. As it turned out, ""HH"" was just another shark in the Hollywood Pool. At least his aircraft were interesting."

","Martin Scorcese's lengthy homage to Howard Hughes is alternately gripping and aloof and unfortunately is forced to rely far too much on the dubious acting talents of its lead, Leonardo DiCaprio. As Hughes, the perpetually cherubic DiCaprio simply doesn't have enough panache for the role, and the sometimes-garish makeup that's intended to show Hughes' aging merely accentuates DiCaprio's anachronistic performance.<br/><br/>The movie spans a few decades in Hughes' heyday, from the 1920s to the 1940s, from his beginnings as producer/director of Hell's Angels to his appearance before a Senate investigatorial committee. Hughes fights with everyone - Hollywood censors, the starlets he dated, his employees, the U.S. government, and rival airline tycoons, sometimes to the benefit of Hughes' myriad business interests, and more often to their debit. The film largely deals with Hughes' involvement in films and in the airline business, choosing to gloss over or ignore entirely his casinos in Las Vegas and the years leading up to his death in 1976.<br/><br/>At the crux of things, though, are Hughes the Film Producer and Hughes the Aviation Pioneer. From his long-delayed Hell's Angels - which made him a national star - to his mammary-obsessed The Outlaw, The Aviator shows how single-minded Hughes was in his relentless pursuit of the Perfect Movie. Because he was independently wealthy and could lean on his own funds to keep production moving, Hughes worked outside the traditional Hollywood studio system, shaping Hollywood to fit his own ideas and methods. Not everything worked - and not every idea was well received - but Hughes remained a man unwilling to compromise his principles; some might call this ""stubbornness."" Juxtaposed with Hughes' film travails is his constant drive to improve aviation, from the purchase of what would become TWA to the innovative behemoth Spruce Goose, which unfortunately flew a distance of one mile exactly one time. Hughes is shown as a notorious perfectionist, personally inspecting each new aircraft to see that it met his (unspecified) standards.<br/><br/>At 170 minutes long, The Aviator manages to cram in many useful and interesting tidbits about Hughes' life and times, and even though certain aspects of his personality were omitted (such as his alleged aversion to African Americans), one doesn't get the sense that something's missing. This is a credit to the screenwriter, John Logan, although the runtime didn't hurt.<br/><br/>As is usually the case with DiCaprio movies, the biggest liability in the movie was Leonard DiCaprio himself. As Hughes gets older in the movie, poor Leo looks exactly the same - and worse, acts exactly the same. Even when he's not laden with makeup, DiCaprio looks like he's about 12 years old and facing the real world for the first time. In The Aviator, he has the gravitas of an empty suit, never appearing to be more than, perhaps, the son of Howard Hughes. DiCaprio isn't terrible in the movie, he's just not terribly believable.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is pretty good, though, especially John C. Reilly as his number-two guy and all-around abuse receiver, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, the head of Hughes' rival in air, Pan Am. When you have strong professional performances like the work these people turned in, the movie can suffer an underwhelming lead. Unfortunately, one of the key supporting roles wasn't quite as fulfilling as it should have been - that of Katharine Hepburn, played quirkily by Cate Blanchett. Blanchett adopted Hepburn's idiosyncrasies and personality tics as well as her odd, off-putting stuttering vocal delivery. Now, I'm not saying the real Katharine Hepburn wasn't exactly as Blanchett portrayed her, but her mannerisms were so over the top that they were distracting and annoying. Blanchett won an Oscar for her performance; I believe a Razzie would have been more suitable.<br/><br/>The movie's not much more than an interesting glimpse at a long-dead icon until it reaches the Senate hearings chaired by Senator Brewster (Alan Alda, who also garnered an Oscar nomination). Here especially, Hughes' strength really shows through, although a present-day viewer might wonder how much of the hearings proceeded exactly as depicted in this movie. Alda, by the way, is fine - although I kept seeing those usual Alda mannerisms, which made me think of Hawkeye Pierce instead of a bad-guy politico.<br/><br/>Overall, The Aviator isn't quite the epic it wanted to be, and although it's well paced and benefits from fine supporting performances, it does suffer from an unworthy lead performance."
"antoniotierno","6","2","4","30 June 2005"," not enough entertaining
","Set in the Hollywood Golden Era, this is an excellent and lavish biopic on Howard Hughes, one of 20th century most charismatic and influential figures. Nevertheless, despite its being an energetic and evocative job of recreating atmospheres of the 30's and 40's, I find it's quite disappointing on the whole. The 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime is very, very long, too long. So, though interesting for being a tale about a successful businessman who climb higher, higher and higher (Howard Hughes is somehow a forerunner of many nowadays tycoons), I figure ""The Aviator"" is neither that interesting nor able to catch the audience attention for all the entire time. Besides, Scorsese doesn't manage to get into the lead's head, unveiling men's dark side, like he did in taxi Driver for instance."

I also loved the performances from Cate Blanchet etc, thought they were superb.<br/><br/>The only thing i was disappointed with was the fact Errol Flyn and Howard Hughes were very good friends during his movie making years, and they did not really show this in the film, and i would have loved to have seen DiCaprio and Law like this.<br/><br/>Also, I am hoping for a sequel to show his Vegas years, as that is one of his interesting parts of his life and would love to see how they would do it on the screen."

","Having seen 'The Aviator' now twice, it is my opinion that negative critics of the film are fat boring loafers with no love of film. It is brilliantly crafted in all ways; perhaps most in depicting the journey of an afflicted but committed individual's mind.<br/><br/>The review posted under the credits on the IMDb page is noteworthy, but shows his/her naivety of life when requesting more progress of the character.. What more do you want? We meet Howard as a rich but doubted character and leave him a record breaking success close to losing his mind completely. Perhaps the reviewer would have preferred Howard catch a dog in his arms, as the dock roared with laughter? Read between the lines pessimists!"
"ssvikas","9","2","4","12 May 2005"," Must Watch: Caprio & Blanchett have done a great Job!
","Plot Outline: The movie traces the life of millionaire movie mogul and aviator Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) from his late teens to his early forties. Set in the 1930's and 40's, the movie depicts the protagonist's mindset as he romances Hollywood's babes Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and his wild planes with equal zest.<br/><br/>Comment: Scorsese makes a great effort to portray a crazy genius in the best possible way anyone could. Although a lot of my friends who've seen this movie say that 'emotion' is missing in this movie in a big way, I prefer to say that Hughes was a character about whom there is very little in the public domain, especially about his childhood and old-age. Further, it is extremely difficult to portray someone's thought process, something as wild as Hughes' with accuracy and emotion. I would say that, within the given constraints, Scorsese has made his best.<br/><br/>The Five Oscars that the movie got are really well deserved. In fact, I would say that Aviator deserved better than Million Dollar Baby. By saying this, I mean that Underdog-winner concepts have always struck the sentimental chord. It would be pertinent to recollect the success of movies such as Seabiscuit, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, etc. Caprio has rendered a brilliant performance which has been under-rated by many. Other stars did a great job too. Blanchett had the meatiest role of all.<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5/5"

","The first response I got from a friend after coming out of the movie was ""so what was the point of the story?"" The Aviator is exactly that statement. There is so much going on in the story, but none of them built up to a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>The story is too broad and the conversations too long, leaving my eyes wandering off the screen every 15 minutes, and when I come back, guess what, the plot has taken a 90 degree sharp turn into a different direction. It's like, wait! I thought it's about his courtship with Hepburn and his love for aviation, but how come now it's about his sexual infatuation with 15-year-old girls and germ phobic? Next thing you know, it's about urine in milk bottles and corrupted post war senators...<br/><br/>For all I care, I enjoyed the character of Hepburn (unfortunately vanished without a trace 1/3 into the story), the awesome test flights and crashes (only great paced editing), the court hearing, and the super comic moments with Ian Holm.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is an hour too long, and need to be more focused on a central theme."
"saint_tom93","10","2","4","30 April 2005"," GREAT acting!
","ONE of the things that impressed me about the acting is that Kate Hepburn actually looked and acted like Kate Hepburn, Jude Law was a great Errol Flynn, and I've never seen Leonardo do so well -- I've never seen Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin play such convincing villains -- The best scene of the movie was the confrontation between Alan Alda and Leonardo -- My heart just went out to see how he was harassed and hounded by government at the behest of his sworn enemy -- From the beginning of the movie, you could see what a genius he was in the area of aviation! The sets were great -- I loved all that old art deco, and using Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor scored for orchestra by Leopold Stokowski was a WONDERFUL touch -- I was impressed with the movie in every way -- a true joy to behold!"

He blew the lid on what was impossible because to him, if you thought it, you could do it.<br/><br/>A bit of trivia: both Hughes and his one-time love Ava Gardner had the same birthday - 24th December.<br/><br/>I suspect this film was more ""one for the boys"".

"Kiski","6","2","4","30 March 2005"," Very disappointing indeed
","I have to admit that I didn't expect much of this movie in the first place. I had heard comments about it (both for and against it), but as it won all the academy awards it did but succeeded in NOT winning the ""important"" ones, I became curious of it. There had to be things right in this movie, but also a lot of wrongs.<br/><br/>I was right about that. I'm sad to say that the good or even great things were in the minority. One of the highlights was Cate Blanchett as Ms. Hepburn. She did an amazing work and really earned the Oscar she won. Then there were the beautiful airplane-scenes and the dressing and everything else. But that's about it.<br/><br/>On the minus side there we have a story that might interest someone who is either familiar with Howard Hughes' life, interested in aviation or just American. I'm not any of those. I do know Mr. Hughes by reputation but I had never before seen what kind of person he was. And Leonardo DiCaprio didn't help much in that. There are actors that can express an amazingly wide variation or emotions with minimum acting, like it took no effort at all. Then there are people like DiCaprio, who have to struggle for the slightest emotion and who look like they're in physical pain in even the supposedly easiest scenes there are.<br/><br/>DiCaprio did a good work at times though. He wasn't bad all together. But many of the scenes made me feel bad for the original H.H. After all, there is a difference in acting someone with compulsive disorders and someone with a bellyache... <br/><br/>I can't really say you should see this. If you want to, go ahead. I wouldn't suggest it though. This movie takes your time and your money and leaves you feeling empty. If you're a fan of the actors or actresses, go see it. Especially if you like Cate Blanchett. She is the best thing in the whole movie. But if you don't know a thing about Howard Hughes or aren't in to aviation...forget about it."
"BushLiedMarinesDied","5","2","4","28 February 2005"," DeCaprio Recites Howard Hughes' Lines, Badly
","I really wish I could be more inclined to like The Aviator. Howard Hughes lead an interesting, if somewhat strange, life. He covered an era of enormous change & discovery in the world & America, as well as developing & promoting many great developments himself (noteably the cantilever bra for Jean Harlow!).<br/><br/>I also love Marting Scorsese, he's made some marvelous films. Even Leonarod DeCaprio showed great promise after Catch Me if You Can. Yet this films lacks that ""something"", this assembly of parts is less than you would expect when viewed as a whole.<br/><br/>First of all lets start with the good. Alan Alda is terrific, snarly & mean as Sen. Brewster & after this performance Kate Blanchet would surely be the top choice for anyone wanting to do the life story of Katherine Hepburn. Gwen Steffani as Jean Harlow does a passable job, but lacks the uh, ""assets"" that so enamored Harlow to Hughes & Jude Law continues to build up a great body of work as Eroll Flynn. It is admittedly hard to portray such well know people on screen, when you have actors portraying actors.<br/><br/>This is what is so unforgivable about DeCaprio. Hughes is largely unknown to the public, we have seen some old footage resurface with the release of this film, mainly the congressional hearings he was involved with. But DeCaprio simply does not capture the voice, the mannerisms or the look of Hughes. Is it as if he's still at the ""reading through the lines"" stage, not acting at all. What we are left with is Leonardo DeCarpio reciting Howard Hughes' words in a flat, soul less manner. What we are seeing is DeCaprio, only what we hear is Hughes.<br/><br/>Some of the CGI is also flaccid, the crash that played such a central role in the way Hughes' life developed is obviously fake, much like the Japanese aircraft in Pearl Harbor (which would have looked more convincing if they'd been on strings!). Some people get carried away with CGI special effects, they are captivated with the cleverness of what they can do, without realising that the final footage can look simply uninspiring. These directors can learn a lot from such classics as The Battle of Britain for tips on how to film flying sequences that pack an emotional punch, all without a single kilobyte of CGI.<br/><br/>Also the story line is somewhat sanitised. The poster for this film says that ""Some dreamed of the future, he built it"" yet this does not line up at all well with Hughes' insistence on pursuing the Spruce Goose project. This was done both at great public & private costs, leading to a technological dead end. This was obvious for a very long time, yet Hughes wouldn't face up to reality & stuck with outdated technology while the world around him changed. He didn't build the future, he built the past. Whatever his previous achievements were this showed his inability to move on past a certain period of time in his life.<br/><br/>This film ranks along with such other Guff-Monsters as Titanic & Pearl Harbor, although it is a far better effort than either of those two dreadful films. None the less Aviator is in this category because it should be good, could have been fantastic, but in the end it is simply acceptable"
"JAM-31","5","2","4","23 February 2005"," Major Disappointment
","I was looking forward to this movie probably more than any other this year. After all, I love aviation, aviation history, the 1930's, the 1940's, and am a fan of biopics. Based on the early reviews for it, I was not going to be disappointed. But regardless of the acclaim that this film gets or the awards that it may receive, ""The Aviator"" is pretty much a mess.<br/><br/>To be fair, although I have always found him interesting, I am not very knowledgeable on Howard Hughes' life. I knew that he had contributed much to aviation, that he was very rich and successful, about the ""Spruce Goose"" fiasco, about his reclusive end, and I had loved ""Hell's Angels."" It's tough not to admire a pilot pioneer whose main passions appeared to have been flying, making films, and hot women. But all of these elements failed to live up to those things on screen.<br/><br/>""Hell's Angels"" is one of the most interesting and unusual films that can be seen today. It wasn't a dramatic masterpiece; it was more of a guilty pleasure. Today we marvel at the incredible stunt work and visuals from that film, as well as a zeppelin attack that resembles campy science fiction, a silly love triangle with over-the-top acting, and images that have been colored by hand, long before movies were in color. The stories behind the making of that film are equally interesting; it is rumored that three pilots died while making it, and that Hughes himself performed a stunt that nobody else would. These things are only mentioned as an afterthought at the movie's premiere.<br/><br/>Then there is Hughes' ""womanizing."" Leonardo Dicaprio is too boyish, and just not believable when it comes to this. Since we know that Hughes had every major starlet at some point, we are just supposed to accept that Hughes had the charm and wit to get them. But what is his charm, other than that he's a hot-shot pilot with lots of money (ahem... did I just answer my own question?) A scene where HH seduces a cigarette girl (added at Leo DiCaprio's request) is poorly written and flat-out unconvincing--he's doing a poor man's imitation of Trent seducing the cocktail waitress in ""Swingers,"" at best. Leo never has much chemistry with the women who come and go throughout his life. Why did they stay (if, only briefly) with him? A scene with Catherine Hepburn's family makes us believe that she was his most important connection, yet the scene really doesn't fit in with the rest of the story--it is a plant with no payoff.<br/><br/>Many other scenes are just there, yet provide no drive or momentum for the film; why do we need to see Jude Law play Errol Flynn (also unconvincingly) in one scene? What was the point of the (suppossedly hilarious) scene in which Ian Holm tries to convince the ratings board with calipers that the cleavage presented in ""The Outlaw"" is acceptable? What I was most disappointed with in ""The Aviator"" were HH's achievements in aviation. We all know that he was an important pioneer in aviation, but after seeing this film, I can't exactly say why. The dream of expanding the airlines is mostly dealt with by depicting the rivalries of Pan-Am and TWA--not very interesting. Most of his daring exploits are, again, poor imitations, this time of the daring exploits from ""The Right Stuff""--a far superior film. Great emphasis is placed on the ""Spruce Goose,"" which is probably not something that HH should be too proud of. The film really loses steam in its last third; by the time he made it to the hearings, I really didn't care whether HH won or lost.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes was a lot of things, but I can't tell what was most important about him after watching ""The Aviator."" Grade: C+"
"majikstl","7","2","4","13 February 2005"," Ahead in the clouds...
","When it comes to filmed biographies, I set a simple standard. For me the minimum expectation in seeing a film biography is that, in the end, I walk away with the feeling that I have met someone worth meeting. Just because the subject of the film is famous or important won't impress me; the film has to prove that that person should be important to me.<br/><br/>I mean, when I left the film MELVIN AND HOWARD, a slice-of-life comedy about Melvin Dumar whose brief encounter with celebrity gave him his 15 minutes of fame, I was exhilarated; the film introduced me to someone unique, someone I was glad I met, no matter how fleeting the meeting or fleeting his fame. On the other hand, when I walked out of RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS, two wildly overpraised bios by Martin Scorsese, my honest reaction was ""So what?"" Jake LaMotta and Henry Hill were of no interest to me before those films and are of even less interest to me now. And nothing Scorsese did stylistically within those films made those characters in any way interesting. I think RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS are lousy movies because those characters did not touch me in anyway.<br/><br/>Now here is Scorsese, the maker of those two films, directing a biopic about Howard Hughes, the Howard in MELVIN AND HOWARD. The film does have one thing in its favor immediately: Hughes was one fascinating individual, so it would seem almost impossible to make an uninteresting film about him. Though, one would have to overlook THE CARPETBAGGERS, the silly 1962 soap opera loosely based on Hughes' life; and to take into account that the subject of THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ was also an incredible individual, yet Scorsese managed to do a total hatched job on him.<br/><br/>THE AVIATOR suffers from the same problem as most biopics: too much story, too much man, too much legend and too little time. Who he was competes for screen time with what he did. Even as it pushes toward three hours, it barely touches upon the influence that the man had. A whole film could have been made just about his dabbling in movie making. But the film does a great job at targeting the highlights of his early life and using those moments to illustrate his advancing state of mental illness. And even then, the film seems incomplete as it ends his story long before the intensity of Hughes' mental illness took control of his life. Ironically, the film takes on too much of his life and yet doesn't cover enough of it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting thing about THE AVIATOR is that it a sympathetic story about a multimillionaire. Indeed the film's advertising sells it as a man-against-the-system success story, even though the battles he fights are largely designed to consolidate his power and increase his wealth. What Hughes does in the film seems neither more nor less ruthless, reckless and/or self-centered than any of his adversaries. He was, it would seem, born into wealth; lived the life of a spoiled playboy, noted for his numerous affairs; and excelled at being an aggressive businessman, not above hostile takeovers. Just the sort of character that Hollywood loves to hate. The film could have easily painted a very cruel and negative picture of Hughes, but, perhaps because of his mental illness -- or perhaps because, like Scorsese, Hughes was an obsessive filmmaker -- the story is at the very least respectful of the man and his accomplishments.<br/><br/>At first Leonard DiCaprio seems far too young to play Hughes, especially as the prevailing image of Hughes is either that of an older man in his prime or as an old man, stewing in the decay of his own mental illness and the cocoon of wealth. But DiCaprio does a remarkable job of showing us that Hughes had a youth, that he was an angry, aggressive young man of considerable ambition and a degree of genius. And DiCaprio takes Hughes past the stages of callow youth and into the physical and mental decline of a wounded warrior. One hopes that DiCaprio will revisit the character in a decade or two to explore the second half of the millionaire's eccentric life. There is more to be told and DiCaprio seems to have the talent to see this man's life through. DiCaprio's efforts are only overshadowed by Cate Blanchett's scene-stealing turn as a strong-willed and tough-minded Katharine Hepburn.<br/><br/>If I have any real problem with THE AVIATOR it is that it does seem to adhere to the standard biopic blueprint of this-happened-that-happened. The story might have been better approached in the style of CITIZEN KANE, juggling the past with the present, telling the story from various viewpoints. After all, Hughes was a Kane-like figure: powerful, ruthless, kind, self-important and contradictory. KANE's message was that you can't really get to know a man; THE AVIATOR seems to think it knows its subject a little too well. But as is, the film is a solid and entertaining piece of stylish and colorful film-making. It takes off and stays aloft until the end."

","I was thoroughly disappointed by this very, very long exercise in Leonardo-watching. DeCaprio has never delivered on the promise that he made in the underrated What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". A terrific cast is wasted in this tedious and uneven film. How Allen Alda was somehow singled out for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar is completely beyond comprehension. The finest work is done by the always stunning Cate Blanchet. Director Scorsese has done some many great films previously, except of course the horribly miscast, Gangs of New York (perhaps a real brawling tough Irish actor like Colin Farrel might have done the trick as a tough brawling Irish immigrant rather than the rather feminine DeCaprio)so it is particularly unsatisfying to endure this non-epic. Eleven nominations for this laughable inconsistent mess is testimony to the ludicrous nature of the Academy Awards. Avoid this movie and go to The Very Long Engagement instead."

","There is casting and then there is acting.<br/><br/>The Aviator is well acted, with Cate Blancett in particular turning in an outstanding job.<br/><br/>The film is poorly cast because few of the actors have the heft necessary to portray their characters. DiCaprio is a boyish lightweight. Ava Gardner had a presence that her imitator lacks. Hepburn was born to privilege, Blancett merely acts. Alan Alda is charming but not believable as a powerful man. Alec Baldwin, in contrast, suggests the seriousness, complexity, and deviousness of a major business player in the 1940s. <br/><br/>What does it mean that the actors of today cannot convey the actors of yesterday? Maybe Errol Flynn is beyond imitation, but I think not. Perhaps preferences for both actors and acting styles now discourage larger-than-life figures. The earlier era valued beauty, boldness, willfulness, and wit, none of which are in vogue."

","For most of my adult life Howard Hughes was a cartoon figure: the endlessly lampooned, reclusive, phobic multi-millionaire. What little I knew of the back story only deepened the caricature -- the Spruce Goose, the Russell bra, the Hollywood romances. So it was a delightful surprise to find this blockbuster giving me a glimmer of a real human being, talented wunderkind, supremely creative, paranoid, loyal, mentally ill. DiCaprio as Hughes and Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn were both stunning -- sure Oscar nominees I think. The special effects were beyond what I needed, but I loved the sense of high-speed parallel lives of the pioneer aviator, the empire builder tackling movie production, aircraft design, and an international air line simultaneously, the relentless womanizer lost without a woman, the obsessive-compulsive matching egos with the mighty of Hollywood, Washington, and Wall Street, as he is drawn deeper into the vortex of his illness."

","Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett, and Kate Beckinsale, among others, ""The Aviator"" is marvelous beyond words. Of every movie I've ever seen, this ranks in my top 3 for best EVER. The acting is spectacular and should earn Leo the Best Actor Oscar. Martin Scorsese did a fantastic job directing one of the greatest films of our time. It should leave the Oscar's with Best Picture, just like it did in the Golden Globes. Although I haven't seen many of the films up for nomination for Best Picture, I can't imagine any of them being better than Aviator. It is the ""Citizen Kane"" of my generation. At about two hours and 45 minutes long, you enter the theater prepared to sit through some boring parts. Your preparations have been wasted because this movie will grab your attention like a vice. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Howard Hughes, a man who loves planes, among other things. After taking three years and $4 million dollars to make ""Hell's Angels"", a WWI film, he becomes incredibly famous. He uses his fame to attract Kathryn Hepburn, who is played by Cate Blanchett. He loves Kathryn but lets business and other things get in the way too much. At first, she was fine with it and actually proud of him, like when he broke the speed record. But she begins to realize that he has too much devotion towards work to give her enough love and care. When she leaves him, this marks the beginning and cause to his downward spiral. After Hepburn leaves, Hughes looks for other women. At times he seems happy, but you know the only woman he really wants is Kathryn. Hughes has this weird phobia of germs. When he was a child, his mom quarantined him so he wouldn't get any of the dangerous diseases that were going around. The first scene of the movie shows Hughes's mom is giving him a bath with this black soap that comes in a tin. Throughout the movie, he uses the same soap to vigorously was his hands free of any germs. One time, the bathroom door had a knob and Hughes didn't want to touch it. He waited until another person came in to sneak out. Later in the film, during Hughes total breakdown, germs are just about his only concern. Hughes had purchased the airliner TWA and is being challenged by Pan Am Airlines throughout the film. The owner of Pan Am(Alec Baldwin) knows TWA will be a big threat, and he doesn't want Hughes to start using his innovations for flying. Baldwin is constantly trying to buy out TWA, especially when Hughes is deeply distraught with his germs breakdown. Hughes will never sell because he knows that once he gets his start, there will be no stopping him. Hughes is hired by the Air Force to build two planes: a spy plane and a transport plane. Whiles Hughes is test piloting the spy plane, this is an unknown problem, and the plane crashes. Hughes barely survives, but is badly injured and must walk with a cane for the rest of his life. He is also covered with burns. This, of course, plagues him. Pan Am airlines wrote a bill to be passed by Congress allowing only one airline to fly across the Atlantic. They gave this bill to a congressman that they bribed. Later, that congressman warrants a search of Hughes's house. They dig up dirt on Hughes and make him go to public hearings. Pan Am thinks the hearings will hurt Hughes image and cause TWA out of business. But, Hughes is an excellent speaker and turn the tide to favor him. The Hercules, which is the 200 ton transport plane the Air Force asked Hughes to build, isn't finished before the war ends so the U.S. stops funding him. Hughes still finishes the plane with his own money and claims ""If the Hercules doesn't fly, I will leave this country(US)"" What happens? You'll just have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>Tom's Titillating Rating: A+"

The story itself spans Hughes life for 20 yrs. From the filming of his first film ""Hells Angels"" to his flying of the spruce goose in 1947. The performances are also of note. Especially Leonardo Dicaprio, finally shedding his teeny boy image with his portrayal of Howard Hughes. Gritty and realistically playing a man of many demons and phobias. Also of note is Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. She is magnificent while making Hepburn a real person instead of the impersonation she could have been. Also praise must be said about Alec Baldwin( with the best use of the f word in in modern movies), Alan Alda, Danny Houston, Matt Ross, John C.Reily(strongly playing Noah Deitrich), Adam Scott and Kate Beckinsale expertly playing Ava Gardner. This film is a treat for movie goers who loves films from all eras.

"moviefan2003va","8","2","4","21 January 2005"," Good movie
","This is a good movie. It's not great movie but it is handsomely filmed and well acted. The problem with the movie is that it probably ""bites off more than it can chew"". The life of Howard Hughes is large in scope and I think a better movie would have chopped down that scope a little bit more. This makes the movie too long in my opinion. <br/><br/>The acting is very good. I was concerned about how boyish Di Caprio looks when I heard he was cast in this part. You forget about that because of his acting. He is quite outstanding and deserving of his acting nods. When I first saw Blanchett introduced as Hepburn on the golf course in the movie, I was initially concerned that she was overacting. But she settles in quite nicely in this part. She is a known brilliant actress and she comes through with selling herself as Hepburn. The Ava Gardner part is probably the most poorly written character (as she just suddenly pops up in the movie without any real introduction or foundation) but I liked Kate Beckinsale's performance. Other supporting characters like Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Jude Law, Kelli Garner, Alec Baldwin, and Willem Dafoe were all good. John C. Reilly and Adam Scott were also good. It's amazing how much top talent is in this movie.<br/><br/>The footage of the crash and the flying footage is excellent. The set pieces, the recreation of the Coconut Grove, and planes, the costumes, and score are everything you would expect for a movie that will likely be nominated for an Oscar."

"lowellharris","10","2","4","6 January 2005"," As grand an entertainment as we've come to expect from Scorsese.
","Scorsese knows how to mine the neuroses of his characters and in The Aviator he has one of his richest subjects for this purpose. DiCaprio's evolving characterization from the young to the older, moustached Hughes who some of us older folks remember especially well, rightfully deserves high praise. Like so many biographies, this was not intended to be a documentary, I'm sure, but a reflection of the idiosyncrasies that made Hughes stand out like the battleships of the sky he conceived and built. Some of the other reviewers here have suggested a comparison between Scorsese's Hughes and Welles's Kane, reflecting the same kind of explicit arrogance and power, and I agree. To those comments, I would like to add that the real Hearst wrote an enduring chapter in American journalism, just as Hughes's accomplishments in the fields of aviation and, particularly notable at his death, medical research, endures for us far beyond the public image of the mentally ill reclusive. We love cinema characters overflowing with competing flaws and ideas of genius, and Scorsese has provided us with an enjoyable time in the theater and a period of long reflection afterward.<br/><br/>Bravo Marty, again. I don't care if The Aviator doesn't match or beat his cinematic prowess in Raging Bull or Goodfellas; I only know that in an era of such motion picture mediocrity, it's a pleasure to see the Scorsese Team delight us with great direction, superlative editing as usual from Schoonmaker, and matchless cinematography by Richardson. No other director today knows how to make such a ""complete"" film."
"meeza","8","2","4","31 December 2004"," Aviator Glides with near Greatness
","Can legendary Director Martin Scorsese ""score"" his long-awaited Best Director Oscar with his Howard Hughes bio ""The Aviator""? Most oddsmakers feel Marty will be sipping a few ""martynis"" after he receives his first golden boy at this year's Academy Awards. However, Scorsese has been the favorite before and left home empty-handed. For example: 1) The ""Taxi Driver"" oversight many felt was not ""fare"" 2) Many also felt that Academy voters were ""Bad Fellas"" for not awarding Marty the statuette for ""Good Fellas"" 3) Even others felt that the 2003 Academy Awards should have been renamed ""The Gong Show"" for not recognizing Scorsese for his ""Gang Show"" that is ""Gangs of New York"". However, I do think Scorsese will reach new Oscar heights for his spectacular & mesmerizing direction of ""The Aviator"". The bio film focuses on the legendary billionaire, aviator mogul, and Hollywood big wig that was Howard Hughes. ""The Aviator"" takes off with Hughes' relentless direction of ""Hell's Angels"" and ends with the Pan Am/TWA Senate Hearings. During its airtime, ""The Aviator"" exhibits: Hughes romances with Hollywood starlets, his aircraft obsessions, and speaking of obsessions: his obsessive compulsive disorders. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Howard Hughes was definitely worth a billion bucks. He portrayed Hughes as capricious, obsessive (of course), enterprising, focused, rigid, suave, and strenuous. Leo's work is one of the best of the year! Pero que ""Leo"" se va forma si no lo nominan para un Oscar. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, one of Hughes' Hollywood conquests, was hypnotic. Blanchett's ""vowelistic"" vocal interpretation of Hepburn's infamous gab was definitely something to ""vowel, I mean, bow down to"". Hughes romanced Hepburn before she hooked up with Spencer Tracy. I guess the billionairo proved that he can ""have his Kate and eat it too"". Speaking of Hollywood starlets, Kate Beckinsale was a sight of comeliness as Ava Gardner. Ava Maria! She looked hot! Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Danny Huston, and the great John C. Reilly were competent ""aviator"" attendants as the supporting acting co-pilots of ""The Aviator"". The film's cinematography, art direction, and costume design were stellar and not in the ""just plane"" category. The only downfall of ""The Aviator"" was its overlong running time. This nearly three-hour film flight should have landed at the 2-hour runway. Still, it should be your priority not to miss the next theatre flight of ""The Aviator"". **** Good"

"rosscinema","8","2","4","31 December 2004"," Scorsese's energetic biopic reminds audiences of the mystique of Hughes
","It's quite natural to remember Howard Hughes as the old recluse who suffered from his own demons and eccentricities but this film instead shines on the man during his most important years where he often over shadowed the most prominent of movie stars. The film starts out in the later part of the 1920's where Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) is smack in the middle of making ""Hell's Angels"" with Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani) and continues with his activities as one of the most important pioneers in aviation.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** From 1927 through 1947 we watch Hughes as a playboy dating some of the most recognizable actresses including Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and Faith Domergue (Kelli Garner) and it's his relationship with Hepburn that was one of his most passionate. Hughes was the top shareholder for TWA and controlled it but Pan Am president Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) wants to buy it but Hughes keeps refusing his offers which leads to Trippe getting Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) threatening Hughes with an investigation and attempting to ruin his future business deals. Hughes also breaks several speed records with aircraft that he's designed and even through surviving plane crashes he still builds and flies the Hercules (aka Spruce Goose) which is the largest airplane ever built. While all this goes on Hughes deals with his own personal demons that would eventually get the better of him from constantly washing his hands to being paranoid and getting stuck on certain words and phrases.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese once again splendidly recreates a certain point in time and here it's Hollywood during the 20 years when Hughes was at his most industrious. There are two ways that old Hollywood can be recreated today and the first would be in black and white but cinematographer Robert Richardson gives us the other alternative with beautiful colors. Some of the shots in the film range from the colorful interiors to the soft haze of certain close-ups that is reminiscent of photo's of old Hollywood stars. The performances are exceptional and Blanchett should be given special praise for the ungodly task of recreating the spirit of Hepburn. I've heard many comment that DiCaprio doesn't exactly embody Hughes and I agree but I look at his performance the same way that I see this film. Not only does DiCaprio capture the drive and nerve of the man but he also gives the audience a reason to be interested in his accomplishments and failures. As a director Scorsese sets the bar pretty high even for himself and while this isn't exactly as riveting as ""Raging Bull"" this is still a superb accomplishment in terms of film-making and one that is a marvel to watch."
"dtketterer","7","2","4","3 January 2005"," Well executed, but poorly told
","Unlike Oliver Stone and Taylor Hackford, the directors, respectively, of ""Alexander"" and ""Ray,"" Martin Scorcese didn't have the convenience of using a household name on which to base his own epic biopic. Concluding 2004's unusual run of biographies on the screen is Leo DiCaprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes, an airline magnate and occasional Hollywood director.<br/><br/>At the start of ""The Aviator,"" DiCaprio's Hughes is something of a stock character. The single-minded, failure-free nature of the young Hughes is something movie-goers have been seeing since Citizen Kane (1941), but the type is so endearing that it's hard not to fall in love with the guy. Then Cate Blanchett enters in a startlingly fun portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, and the movie is off. It's inevitable enough, without knowing beforehand Hughes' personal history, that the two will fall in love, and it's even more obvious that Hughes will bungle it. When Katherine does move out, though, she takes not just her baggage and Hughes' heart, but the life of the film as well.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell if this departure is the cause for the chaos that ensues - business failure, unscrupulous political pressure, and delirium intensify for Hughes as the movie goes on. Once Blanchett's bounciness leaves, the film gets darker and more obsessive by the minute, something that is executed with absolute technical precision. Scorcese doesn't give in, as Hackford did in ""Ray,"" to literal hallucinations; reality just gets sharper - louder, brighter, closer up. <br/><br/>Regardless, it doesn't really add up by the end. The difficulty of the biopic is the filmmaker's obligation to the truth, which is something that never exists in favorable narrative patterns. Scorcese and screenwriter John Logan carefully choose what parts of Hughes' life are screen worthy, and do their best to make art out of it. They're only successful on occasion; the picture, while never lacking conviction, lacks form. There isn't really anything they can do about it, and one gets the impression that Scorcese was constantly convincing himself that climaxes existed in places where they never did. His vision for the epic is strong, but the problem is that it doesn't conform to the real thing. It's hard to imagine what Hughes might have thought of his film - particularly since one leaves the theater without a genuine impression of who he was."

","Howard Hughes in his last two decades sealed himself away from the world. At first he haunted a penthouse in Las Vegas, and then he moved to a bungalow behind the Beverly Hills Hotel. He was the world's richest man, and with his billions bought himself a room he never left.<br/><br/>In a sense, his life was a journey to that lonely room. But he took the long way around: As a rich young man from Texas, the heir to his father's fortune, he made movies, bought airlines, was a playboy who dated Hollywood's famous beauties. If he had died in one of the airplane crashes he survived, he would have been remembered as a golden boy. Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" wisely focuses on the glory years, although we can see the shadows falling, and so can Hughes. Some of the film's most harrowing moments show him fighting his demons; he knows what is normal and sometimes it seems almost within reach.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" celebrates Scorsese's zest for finding excitement in a period setting, re-creating the kind of glamor he heard about when he was growing up. It is possible to imagine him wanting to be Howard Hughes. Their lives, in fact, are even a little similar: Heedless ambition and talent when young, great early success, tempestuous romances and a dark period, although with Hughes it got darker and darker, while Scorsese has emerged into the full flower of his gifts.<br/><br/>The movie achieves the difficult feat of following two intersecting story arcs, one in which everything goes right for Hughes and the other in which everything goes wrong. Scorsese chronicled similar life patterns in ""GoodFellas,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The King of Comedy,"" ""Casino,"" actually even ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" Leonardo DiCaprio is convincing in his transitions between these emotional weathers; playing madness is a notorious invitation to overact, but he shows Hughes contained, even trapped, within his secrets, able to put on a public act even when his private moments are desperate.<br/><br/>His Howard Hughes arrives in Los Angeles as a good-looking young man with a lot of money, who plunges right in, directing a World War I aviation adventure named ""Hell's Angels,"" which was then the most expensive movie ever made. The industry laughed at him, but he finished the movie and it made money, and so did most of his other films. As his attention drifted from movies to the airplanes in his films, he began designing and building aircraft and eventually bought his own airline.<br/><br/>Women were his for the asking, but he didn't go for the easy kill. Jean Harlow was no pushover, Ava Gardner wouldn't take gifts of jewelry (""I am not for sale!""), and during his relationship with Katharine Hepburn, they both wore the pants in the family. Hepburn liked his sense of adventure, she was thrilled when he let her pilot his planes, she worried about him, she noted the growing signs of his eccentricity, and then she met Spencer Tracy and that was that. Hughes found Jane Russell and invented a pneumatic bra to make her bosom heave in ""The Outlaw,"" and by the end he had starlets on retainer in case he ever called them, but he never did.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is nobody's idea of what Hughes looked like (that would be a young Sam Shepard), but he vibrates with the reckless spirit of the man. John C. Reilly plays the hapless Noah Dietrich, his right-hand man and flunky, routinely ordered to mortgage everything for one of Hughes' sudden inspirations; Hughes apparently became the world's richest man by going bankrupt at higher and higher levels.<br/><br/>Scorsese shows a sure sense for the Hollywood of that time, as in a scene where Howard, new in town, approaches the mogul L.B. Mayer at the Coconut Grove and asks to borrow two cameras for a big ""Hells' Angels"" scene. He already had 24, but that was not enough. Mayer regards him as a child psychiatrist might have regarded the young Jim Carrey. Scorsese adds subtle continuity: Every time we see Mayer, he seems to be surrounded by the same flunkies.<br/><br/>The women in the film are wonderfully well cast. Cate Blanchett has the task of playing Katharine Hepburn, who was herself so close to caricature that to play her accurately involves some risk. Blanchett succeeds in a performance that is delightful and yet touching; mannered and tomboyish, delighting in saying exactly what she means, she shrewdly sizes up Hughes and is quick to be concerned about his eccentricities. Kate Beckinsale is Ava Gardner, aware of her power and self-protective; Gwen Stefani is Jean Harlow, whose stardom overshadows the unknown Texas rich boy, and Kelli Garner is Faith Domergue, ""the next Jane Russell"" at a time when Hughes became obsessed with bosoms. Jane Russell doesn't appear in the movie as a character, but her cleavage does, in a hilarious scene before the Breen office, which ran the Hollywood censorship system. Hughes brings his tame meteorology professor (Ian Holm) to the censorship hearing, introduces him as a systems analyst, and has him prove with calipers and mathematics that Russell displays no more cleavage than a control group of five other actresses.<br/><br/>Special effects can distract from a film or enhance it. Scorsese knows how to use them. There is a sensational sequence when Hughes crash-lands in Beverly Hills, his plane's wing tip slicing through living room walls seen from the inside. Much is made of the ""Spruce Goose,"" the largest airplane ever built, which inspires Sen. Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) to charge in congressional hearings that Hughes was a war profiteer. Hughes, already in the spiral to madness, rises to the occasion, defeats Brewster on his own territory and vows that the plane will fly -- as indeed it does, in a CGI sequence that is convincing and kind of awesome.<br/><br/>By the end, darkness is gathering around Hughes. He gets stuck on words and keeps repeating them. He walks into a men's room and then is too phobic about germs to touch the doorknob in order to leave; with all his power and wealth, he has to lurk next to the door until someone else walks in, and he can sneak through without touching anything. His aides, especially the long-suffering Dietrich, try to protect him, but eventually he disappears into seclusion. What a sad man. What brief glory. What an enthralling film, 166 minutes, and it races past. There's a match here between Scorsese and his subject, perhaps because the director's own life journey allows him to see Howard Hughes with insight, sympathy -- and, up to a point, with admiration. This is one of the year's best films."

","Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up to create a movie based on Howard Hughes. I really loved the plot that focused on the character of Howard, how the movie shows his glory days and turning events throughout history. Leonardo DiCaprio does a remarkable job, Martin Scorsese made a rare movie. Not the type of violent gangster movies we the audience are normal with in his work. At the same time it is a pleasant surprise to see him work on a movie like this. Rare to his kind of movies but amazing at the same time. I loved the cinematography of the film that captured all plane sequences.
On the other hand, I feel some scenes were dramatized such as the crash landing scene where Howard gets badly injured. I would have changed it a bit. I would also clearfy the fact about Howard Hughes's obsession with everything clean. I felt the film had no explanation to his kind of ""problem"" thus making it look weird on screen. All in all I recommend because it has a nice character arc of a historical figure who was a weirdo. One of the best movies about aviators and planes."

","'The Aviator' was one of the first collaborations between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio. A film that bears the imprint of the director in print and could be one of the least valued in his career, despite its high stylistic quality.
The story tells the life of the well-known Howard Hughes and how he went from being a recognized magnate to a self-contained man, added to his obsessive compulsive disorder that increased year after year. Finally, the film is about a man who was at the top and had everything, but who for different reasons lost it. This theme is highly recurring in Martin Scorsese's filmography, and although this film is unusual for the director, its style is fully incorporated. However, this very identifying style of the filmmaker undergoes some changes, such as greater attention to the use of colors. Visual changes mostly, because the narrative follows the same line as other Scorsese movies.
There is not much more to say besides that this film is yet another proof of Scorsese's masterful ability to tell a story of power and subsequent fall, but more important than that, it shows his ability to innovate in the way of telling stories."
"timmyminh","9","0","0","18 June 2020"," The Academic Definition of a Cinematic Biopic
","There is something peculiar and special about Martin Scorsese's biopics that stood way out of your average biopics. Scorsese's main focus in making a biopic is not to just pay homage to the figure he is attributing to or just laying out events after events, but he makes it into a character study. It is the same greatness he puts into Raging Bull and The Wolf of Wall Street. In this seminal work, we the audience explore the life of Howard Hughes and his battle with obsessive-compulsive disorder - a very serious mental illness. As well as shows his character's rise and fall as a billionaire as he strives in life in amidst of the struggles and challenges from his mental illness.<br/><br/>One of the most fascinating things about this picture is the technical achievement of it, particularly the cinematography. The story behind it is Scorsese's reminiscence of watching films of the era when he was a child, and he wanted to translate that color techniques in modern filmmaking context. Phenomenal work by cinematographer Robert Richardson who successfully imitates the early American Technicolor dye-transfer process to replicate the vintage look. The cinematography is an evolving color, with two-strip and then three-strip and then modern. All of which is reflective of the period of the time it depicts. Additionally, the films' use of color alteration in every situation, emotion, production design, costumes, and make-up are all used in a very very purposeful way to transcend the depth and meaning through all that. And that is the beauty of a Martin Scorsese picture.<br/><br/>Now one cannot praise this picture without acknowledging the two elephants in the room: the acting performances by Leo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett. This is my personal favorite Leo DiCaprio's performance for the way he just throws himself into the role with a lot of flexibility and portraying the essential emotions of Howard Hughes so intricately. Cate Blanchett is my second favorite actress ever, I never thought she could nail Katherine Hepburn's accent and mannerism like that. She truly truly pays tribute to the great Katherine Hepburn herself. Cate Blanchett has pulled off many amazing performances over the years, as Queen Elizabeth I, Katherine Hepburn, Bob Dylan. If that is not range, I'm sorry but I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Overall, Scorsese's biopics are always more than just a documentary or an average biopic, he always ventures deep into the psychology and emotion of the character and not just events after events. Scorsese's films will be studied for years and forevermore."

In this biopic Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes, in his youth with all his passion, dedication, craziness and eccentricity. He is so daring that the movie is as much a thriller as it is a drama.
And there we see another beautiful collaboration forming up with Scorsese and DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Let me take some words to say about the brilliant Oscar and SAG winning performance by Cate Blanchett. She plays a real life actress who was known for her unconventional off screen life. Now acting is one thing and acting an actor is a whole another thing and not just any, but the greatest female star of Classic Hollywood Cinema, Katharine Hepburn herself. For a 3 hour long movie she had such a short screen time but she was simply stunning with her mannerisms replicating Hepburn.<br/><br/>Scorsese designed each year in this movie to look just the way a color movie from that time period would look. Seeing it for the second time was even more enthralling and made me adore the mastercrafter even more. This is clearly one of the best directed movies i have seen of any directors. Scorsese earned his 5th Oscar, 6th Golden Globe and 6th DGA nominations with this film.<br/><br/>Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 5, the highest number of nominations and win on 2005 Oscar, 14 BAFTA nominations and 4 wins including Best Picture, 6 Golden Globe nominations and 3 wins including Best Picture and Lead Actor, this is<br/><br/>THE AVIATOR

The scenes between Katherine Hepburn and Howard Hughes provide good chemistry but there's so much more to Hughes life this movie could've gone on for another hour. The aviator is determined about Howard's ambition to the aviation industry and the film industry which includes his relationship with Hepburn and his contribution war and sexism films like hells angels, Scarface and the outlaw.

","The second collaboration between Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio finds the duo bringing on screen the larger-than-life story of a larger-than-life figure. A richly detailed, vividly photographed & brilliantly performed epic biographical drama, The Aviator is another fine addition to the esteemed filmmaker's extensive body of work.<br/><br/>With its meticulously detailed set pieces, inventive cinematography & apt costumes, Scorsese takes us back in time to a glamorous era, and paints a fascinating portrait of Howard Hughes from his industry pioneering highs to crushing personal lows. But there are sloppy scenes in between, and its 170 minutes runtime is quite excessive.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays the iconic real-life persona with gusto, articulating Hughes' mannerism, interactions & worsening mental health with gripping intensity. And he's well supported by the rest of the cast, especially Cate Blanchett who leaves her own mark as Katherine Hepburn, plus her chemistry with DiCaprio is delightful to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, The Aviator does soar under Martin Scorsese's assured direction but there are times when he takes the foot off the pedal, thus resulting in loss of momentum.

","'The Aviator', directed by Martin Scorsese, is a biopic of some of the more remarkable years of Howard Hughes. Hughes, was an ambitious film director, a keen pilot, someone famous for his eccentricities and compulsions, and a man that I had never heard of.<br/><br/>The film first focuses on Hughe's ambitious dreams of creating his 'Hell's Angels' war film. Leonardo Di Caprio's initial portrayal of Hughes as an exceedingly charismatic, driven individual had me hooked from the onset. He is able charm employees, businessmen, and actresses, almost effortlessly. Any obstacles that he cannot assuage with his smile, can certainly be overcome by his seemingly endless wealth. Hughes inherited a vast fortune from his father, Howard Hughes Sr., who designed and produced drill bits during the Texas Oil Boom of the early 20th Century. The set, costumes, score, and acting match his opulence beautifully and deserve recognition.<br/><br/>Hughes, however, was a brilliant man in his own right. He is a talented pilot replete with records of speed and daring, but also a remarkable engineer and perfectionist with endless passion for designing planes. But behind this brilliance is a looming insecurity and obsessive mentality. Di Caprio masterfully hints at his decline with the subtle sense of claustrophobia he carries even when the cameras flash on the red carpet in the early film. Hughes' eccentricities reach a climax as he plants cameras and bugs phones of his partners, handles objects with only tissues, and locks himself away for months on end watching films naked as his health and hygiene deteriorate.<br/><br/>His few tethers to reality seemed to be his relationships with Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). I genuinely came to adore Cate Blanchett's character, for her strength but also sensitivities. And Kate Beckinsale too was strikingly natural as opposed to other roles I have seen her in.<br/><br/>I was surprised how well this film fit the mould of an underdog story. Each obstacle Hughes faces, I found myself rooting for him to succeed. When he flew the XF-11, as Bach played earnestly in the background, I could feel tension. And then in the hearings against Owen Brewster, when the enrapturing side of Hughe's comes again to the fore, I felt that justice was being served.<br/><br/>A friend had told me that this was his favourite film. Being curious, I gave it the time and was not disappointed. Hughe's eventually became a complete recluse in the final decades of his life. His years in the sun, however, were certainly magnificent, and Scorsese flew high with this film."

(PG-13)<br/><br/>Extravagant biopic on the life of Howard Hughes (about twenty years worth, anyway): aviation trailblazer, Hollywood director, womanizer of Tinseltown starlets, and eventual obsessive-compulsive recluse.

However, unlike most of Scorcese's other rich central-figure character studies (from Jake LaMotta to Jesus Christ), there doesn't seem to be a prevailing thesis or attitude to the subject; should Hughes be admired, pitied, scorned, championed, etc.? The cast, populated by many famous faces in roles both small and large, rarely disappoints; it was DiCaprio's best work since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" and aside from coming off a bit cartoonish during her early golf game scene, Blanchett is just about perfect as Katharine Hepburn (and won her first Oscar for it).<br/><br/>89/100"

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Aviator is a biographical drama movie that premiered in 2004. The movie is directed by Martin Scorcese and is written by John Logan. Leonardo Di Caprio stars as the leading role of Howard Hughes. The movie covers the early parts of Howard Hughes' life from his early childhood to his attempts at getting the Spruce Goose into action. This movie goes in-depth exploring Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>The Aviator is an excellent movie. This movie is masterfully directed and edited. Martin Scorcese already had an excellent career in direction prior to this movie and The Aviator solidifies his position. This movie's direction and shots are beautiful. It masterfully displays the different stages of Howard Hughes life and his struggles. Early in the movie, Howard Hughes is displayed to be a skilled businessman, engineer, film director, and philanthropist. This worsens as the movie goes on from the struggles he has. The direction shows the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder that Howard Hughes has and it worms its way into parts of his life. The direction is incredibly well-done in this regard.<br/><br/>The main role played by Leonardo Di Caprio is one of the best roles that he has played. This role is absolutely not an easy one. Howard Hughes is portrayed as both a tragic figure and a heroic figure in this movie. The obsessive compulsive disorder that afflicts Howard Hughes is seen early on in his life and gradually he succumbs to the mental disorder. It is heartbreaking to see and it was masterfully played by Leonardo Di Caprio. The audience can take part in his early heroic endeavors and then see as his mental disorder causes him to shrink into a shell of his former self. It was great watching Howard Hughes conquer his disorder in the end and finally own up to his legacy.<br/><br/>This movie centers a lot on the obsessive compulsive disorder that Howard Hughes has. Across the 170 minute running time of the movie, the movie focuses on Howard Hughes and has elements of this disorder come into play. Audiences that do not like drama and do not like such character focused movies should look elsewhere. The audiences that do enjoy watching an interesting historical figure should absolutely watch this movie. This movie portrays the obsessive compulsive disorder incredibly well and shows how a mental disorder can cripple a good mind.<br/><br/>The supporting cast in this movie is excellent. Every casting choice in this movie is top-notch. Special praise should be given to Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, Alan Alda as Senator Owen Brewster, and Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner. These supporting characters really made the character of Howard Hughes play out well and it made the entire movie feel complete. Howard Hughes can be seen as a divisive figure and I am glad that the movie does not shy away from this.<br/><br/>I highly recommend The Aviator. This movie is an excellent biographical drama. The only criticism I had was it only covered a small portion of Howard Hughes' life. I would have wanted a sequel or a longer movie that covered more.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

Throughout the film, Howard Hughes's ambitions get bigger, at the same time he is experiencing a progressive decline in mental stability as a result of his OCD.

"cdjh-81125","7","0","0","5 January 2017"," A Solid (Central) Character Piece
","Martin Scorsese's films all have a distinctive style and tone to them so it's always been nice to see him change things up a bit and while this most certainly has hints of his style The Aviator was a nice departure from his usually films and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this film though it's not without its flaws. Easily the best thing about this film is the central performance of Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, DiCaprio just brings a presence to Hughes making him very charismatic yet charming, his character is never dull to watch and it's always interesting to watch. Mainly because his breakdown into near insanity is so well done, its built up slowly across the films run-time so that when that pivotal moment where he loses his mind it feels merited. If I'm honest I've never been the biggest fan of Cate Blanchett but I can honestly say that I thought she was excellent in this movie, not only was her character just extremely entertaining she had such good chemistry with DiCaprio and her romance with him joint with their gradual parting is done perfectly. The Aviator it set from the mid 30s to the late 40s and the production design joint along with the Costume Design are immaculate, it sucks you right into this period. The actual aviation scenes themselves sequences themselves are very well done, the green screen is completely convincing and they're built up just right so that we understand just how much they mean to Hughes. However if I'm honest while this film is far to well acted and executed to be bad I do think this film is a little overrated. For one while the central character is developed perfectly and given good and clear motivations for his actions the other characters in this film have very little reasoning behind their actions so when they start their attacks against Hughes they don't feel earned and this makes this entire arc fall a bit flat. Another thing this film doesn't do very well is make you feel much sympathy for Hughes, because he's such an unlikable character it doesn't really make you care that much that he has so much at stake. However after this arc finishes I enjoyed the final act and DiCaprios haunting last ""The Way of The Future"" monologue was extremely haunting that did make me feel sympathy for him unlike the previous act of the film. <br/><br/>I do like The Aviator, both DiCaprio and Blanchett are both amazing in this film, it's a fantastic period piece but ultimately where it succeeds with its central character it ultimately fails with the Supporting making for a lot of this film coming of as unsatisfactory. But it's definitely a good film and would recommend it to any fan of Scorsese's work. <br/><br/>72%/B"

I think he must have rubbed someone up the wrong way in Hollywood and they are denying him because of some imagined slight. The Aviator is a long film but never seems to be so as the story absorbs the viewer totally. I would recommend it to anyone. It is beautiful to look at and tells Howard Hughes' story really well"
"AlsExGal","8","0","0","18 August 2015"," Beautifully photographed yet sometimes hard to watch
","I was quite impressed by this portrait of the legendary millionaire eccentric during his Hollywood glamor years, though not shirking the beginning of the darker psychological disintegration that would forever engulf him.. Scorsese directed a dramatic, evocative, beautifully photographed portrait of an eccentric genius, slowly succumbing to his mental demons. As far as his obsessive compulsiveness is concerned, though, I must plead guilt to identifying with him in one scene in the film - that in which he refuses to touch a public washroom door knob. I've been in that position myself any of a number of times.<br/><br/>The opening scene, showing Hughes with his mother, is short but vital in insinuating that Hughes developed his OCD from his mother - either by listening to and remembering her fanatical anti-germ ravings about how he was never safe, or through strict genetics. It was probably a combination of both. Since his mother died young, she did not live to have the disease take over her life as it did with Howard.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is the lightest and the most fun, with Hughes spending three years making ""Hell's Angels"". He's desperate to succeed here because the last thing he wants is to wind up back in Texas making drill bits, the source of the family fortune. This is where anachronism number one appears - Hughes shows his right hand man, Noah Dietrich, the famous part of ""The Jazz Singer"" where Al Jolson is ad libbing one of the few talking segments of that film, claiming that sound is what audiences want and using that as an excuse to redo Hell's Angels AGAIN, this time with sound. The Jazz Singer would have been considered a museum piece by the time Hughes finished the silent version of Hell's Angels in 1929. <br/><br/>I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio and Cate Blanchett were both quite splendid in their roles, even thinking that Leo started looking a bit like the real Hughes as the film progressed. Blanchett may not have looked like Kate Hepburn but she certainly captured the actress's manner and vocal mannerisms to an impressive degree, without ever seeming like a caricature. When the new-money unpolitical Hughes meets Hepburn's family, all old-money Democrats living a commune style existence with even Hepburn's ex-husband living on the family compound, Hughes is confounded by their lifestyle. Frances Conroy of ""Six Feet Under"" does a great job here in a cameo appearance as Hepburn's mother. This section of the film ends with Hepburn leaving Hughes for Spencer Tracy, and is way off base from actual events. Hepburn had been apart from Hughes for several years when she and Tracy actually met.<br/><br/>Since the film told its story in a, more or less, chronological order of events, the film really does seem to be full of anachronisms, as I mentioned earlier. For example, we see Hughes and Hepburn in a nightclub with Errol Flynn at their table, the millionaire talking about shooting a western, The Outlaw, a film that would begin production in 1941. Yet the next scene had Hughes in what was dated across the screen as 1935, clearly long before any thoughts of The Outlaw or any hell raising with Flynn, the latter not becoming a star until the very end of that year.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film for me was the spectacular plane crash during a test flight by Hughes, with the plane wheels scratching along a roof top and one of its wings slicing through the wall of a home. This was viewed from the inside of the home. Great special effects, direction, photography and editing of this knockout sequence. I highly recommend this portrait of a man wrestling with madness who also wanted to be a creator of films and pioneer of aviation, whether he made money or not. If Hughes had just wanted money he would have just stuck with the drill bit business."

I didn't know who Howard Hughes was before i saw this movie, so i didn't really look for anything in particular in Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Hughes. I think Leo did a fine job. The scenes where his character loses his mind (he had mental disorders that he dealt with) were some of the finest acting in the film. The life of Howard Hughes depicted in this film shows that he was a very powerful man who demanded perfection from his associates. However, his mental issues got the better of him when he started to become paranoid about everyone and everything. When he dates Katherine Hepburn (played by Cate Blanchett) there is a bizarre connection between the characters that really stands out to me. The scenes in which Hughes crashes his airplane were pretty unrealistic in my opinion but didn't take much at all away from a really solid movie.<br/><br/>9/10 Though the movie is quite lengthy, the acting, script, and the camera work were all very well done. It glides along majestically showing this generation some of what is was like back then and a glimpse into people who deal with disorders. One scene in particular that will always stand out to me is one in which Hughes is in a bathroom and doesn't want to leave and just stands next to the door because if he were to open the door that means he would have to touch the doorknob and would thus get hands dirty (He was obsessed with being clean)."

","The story really has to get a grip for itself because the movie seems not to be depicting a balanced portrayal of a person. But it may yet slip through as the person depicted lived more than fifty years ago. I see the movie a little too much in depicting Hughes' weaknesses, particularly his obsessive compulsive behavior and his paranoia of just about everything. But that in turn gave Leo his chance to elaborate on his acting. Thus the acting overall is indeed a great work in my eyes. Leo DiCaprio did very well in depicting the movie's version of Howard Hughes. I really like the way hoe Leo's acting seems to carry Hughes' weaknesses to other scenes, even on the ones in which Hughes is a strong person. Having John C. Reilly and an assortment of A-list talents really helped to balance the whole acting overall and took it to the greatness level it deserved."

","Aviator is a piece of artwork that took just as long to make as it took Howard Hughes to build a proper flying airplane; it takes a very penetrating look at the life of an overwhelmingly wealthy person with an idea that required more than attention but attention. The interpretation of his life as depicted by Leonardo DiCaprio needed the advice of Martin Scorsese to fully show the personality but it worked well. Leonardo, the innocent soft faced, I thought would find it difficult to play the role but with definite manipulation from Scorsese, made it through as direct, indirect, attentive, withdrawn, there, not there, berserk, ridiculous, smart, witty, charming, quirky and quiet. This actor I felt gave up a thing that I would call ""baby"" or ""young"" for an actor and reached into adulthood but back to self. Very long - over 3 hours"

And if there must be a biopic of any one man in modern history, then you'd need to go a very long way to find one as worthy. The guy made multi-million dollar movies at a time when a million dollars was a million dollars, while at the same time certain people claimed that the film industry is nothing more a passing fad that will die out within the next ten or so years when people start to get bored with it. And as a matter of fact the film-making side of his life is only scratching the surface of one small portion that defined this unique, yet damaged man. This at times feels somewhat more like a product of Spielberg than of Scorsese, which isn't a criticism because this is as well shot, as it is brilliantly acted, and finely written.

","Biopics almost always run the risk of being criticized for not being accurate representations and 'The Aviator' has had its share of flack. But, rather than being a film about Howard Hughes, it's more specifically about Hughes's passion, whether for films or airplanes, and how he struggled and what he sacrificed to pursue his ultimate goal.<br/><br/>Scorsese's films unique technique has often been praised and the slightly washed out sepia tinted picture in the initial portions of the film do add to a feel of the first half of the 20th century. Additional credit must go to the set designer, art director, costume department, makeup artist and score for recreating the 20s, 30s and 40s. The cinematography is fine. However, the overuse of turquoise in the sepia tinted scenes was a little distracting.<br/><br/>After showing a glimpse of Hughes's childhood, Scorsese focuses on his life from the 20s to the 40s. He was married and was known to have liaisons with various glamorous women but the 'The Aviator' focuses mainly on his relationship with Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner and does a superb job in depicting them. The obsessive compulsive mysophobia was cleverly introduced in the film and becomes a crucial obstacle for Howard. His mental torment and struggle to fight his own demons is captured very well.<br/><br/>This is another career redefining film for Leonardo Dicaprio who performs all guns blazing. Playing a complex character with so many shades couldn't have been an easy job but Dicaprio proves that he is capable of doing it. Fiery Cate Blanchett is spellbinding as Katherine Hepburn. How she captures every nuance of the legendary actress is astonishing. Luminous Kate Beckinsale is a delight and she plays Ava Gardner with subtle sensuality and elegance. John C. Reilly, Matt Ross, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and Frances Conroy provide fine support.<br/><br/>'The Aviator' is ambitious, stylish and classy. I would have liked to see more of Hughes's mental struggle and how he learned to live with it and perhaps more about his relationship with his wife. Then again perhaps this would make the film too long for the standard Hollywood pic."

Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Adam Scott, Matt Ross, Kelli Garner, Brent Spiner, Edward Herrmann, Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>The life of Howard Hughes is vividly re-told in Scorsese's film adaptation, going through his life as a filmmaker and pilot, his marriage to Katherine Hepburn, and his battle with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. All of which take place between the years of 1927-1947.<br/><br/>When we call a film a masterpiece, we normally have symbolism, originality, and pure brilliance in the way that the director presents his action. This is a somewhat different case because though it has some of those qualities, it is mostly an excellent film because of how efficient Scorsese is as a director. The reason I call this a masterpiece is because I found it impossible to find flaws with it, not because of any symbolism or figurative storytelling.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Robert Richardson and the set design by Dante Ferretti are both shockingly creative in the fact that they make you feel like you are back in Howard Hughes's time period. Costume designs by Sandra Powell do not take away from the overall experience either. The real brilliance behind the film however is how Scorsese and DiCaprio make Hughes a more likable character than Katherine Hepburn or Spencer Tracy. Hughes is a connectible character despite the fact that he is a half-insane womanizer. Scorsese's direction is piercingly honest but beautifully touching much like Raging Bull.<br/><br/>The performances are powerful as well especially DiCaprio and Blanchett as Hughes and Hepburn. Beckinsale gets a good chance to show off her beauty as Ava Gardner and Alda gets a great role to work with as well. Yet the most prevailing thing about it is the flawless portrait of a man with psychological disorder and a brilliance in innovation that finds a way to beat his problems no matter how daunting they are."
"bobsgrock","Null","0","0","21 January 2011"," A Herculean achievement.
","Martin Scorsese, long considered the greatest living American director, certainly solidified this status with three gargantuan, monstrous and epic films during the 2000s, portraying three very different time periods in American culture, all while exhibiting his fluid camera style, crisp editing and boundless creative storytelling. Perhaps of the three films, The Aviator might be the most ambitious, extravagant and compelling if only because it tells the story of a real American attempting to pursue that infamous American dream and does so in a massive way, only to lose it in the process through no fault of his own.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes, the most ambitious and impulsive businessman of the 20th century, is a fascinating character not just for his successes but also his failures. Very few, if any, could match his insatiable thirst for success and prestige. Scorsese captures this in nearly every scene, building up for the first 2 hours an enormous tale of lust, greed and ambition that is nothing short of astonishing to watch. This is due in equal parts to Scorsese's magnificent direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's brilliant rendition of Hughes the man.<br/><br/>Scorsese guides the story through nearly every major facet of Hughe's life beginning in 1927 when he is a young kid from Texas using his parents' money to make a Hollywood film, Hell's Angels. His obsessive perfection leads to the film costing nearly $4 million and three years of production. He goes on to make films such as Scarface and The Outlaw, both of which courted much controversy for their content. However, his true love was aviation, which he poured millions of dollars into to stay at the top of the game. His creations were astounding and Scorsese's recreations of such crafts as the X-11 and the Spruce Goose are nothing short of incredible.<br/><br/>For his personal life, Hughes hit the Hollywood jackpot by dating one star after another. Scorsese focuses on the two most important: Katherine Hepburn, his one true love, and Ava Gardner, who saw him more as a soul in need of salvation than a lover. Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her role as Hepburn and it is something to behold; the magnificent way she embodies Hepburn's insatiable New England smugness and conceit. However, DiCaprio's status as one of the very best actors working today needs only this film to justify that statement. He is in practically every scene and owns all of them. His facial expressions, stage presence and overall body language is so perfectly sublime, subdued and structured that he does become Hughes. All Leo haters must look at his work here as something that demands great respect.<br/><br/>Along with Gangs of New York and The Departed, Martin Scorsese and Leonard DiCaprio created three magnificently entertaining films dealing with similar protagonists: a man tortured by his past and struggling to forge ahead in the future. This is not so unlike other Scorsese characters like Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta or Rupert Pupkin. There is also a bit of Scorsese in Hughes' professional life. Both are obsessed with detail, focused solely on the task at hand and very successful because of this. A great tribute to a great man from a great director."

The crash scene close to Beverly Hills and the Spuruce Goose taking off are worth the ticket. I am not too postitive about the movie..there is something lacking..editing may be or the dialogue?

","This movie was so, so, so good. I saw it for the first time mainly for Leonardo DiCaprio...I'm a fan of his and I'd heard good things about this movie...and I didn't have any idea what to expect, considering I knew next to nothing about Howard Hughes. And it wasn't that I came out of this movie knowing much more, considering that there were historical inaccuracies and Scorsese chose to dramatize certain characters and points in his life and leave others out. But I did come out of it enormously entertained. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you, not making you think or analyze everything but still staying in your mind because it makes a big impact. Every single scene, every single sequence was gorgeously shot, and so much detail was put into imitating each setting and each character. And the writing was great...while the story didn't have a set arc (it's hard to do a really story arc in biopics because real life just isn't like that...) each moment and line is so symbolic of everything the movie is and everything to come. From after the huge crash sequence (a terrifying sequence, as you feel like you're there), when Howard is lying on the ground and chokes out, ""I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator"" to the end scene when he thinks back on his childhood future for himself and how it was all coming true, but he couldn't so much enjoy it because of his debilitating mental condition, it was just perfect. <br/><br/>I've read so much about how the characters were so ""miscast,"" but I couldn't disagree more. Leo is perfect as a pre-downward-spiral Hughes (a strange casting choice, but one that made sense nonetheless, considering his contribution to the picture on a producing standpoint and his real life as an idolized but extremely private celebrity as Howard Hughes was in his glory days) and his acting just got better and better as the film went on. When you end up in the Senate hearings sequence and you see him on screen, he's such a complete dead ringer for Howard Hughes...right down to the things he says, the way he says them, the way he carries himself, his fidgeting, his facial expressions...even his appearance (although not really close to Hughes's at all to begin with) is so accurate. Leo really did his research and gave Hughes his own spin while still getting as close to the actual mannerisms of the man as possible. He gives such a convincing performance I'm surprised that he was able to come out of the character at the end of the day. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett was an amazing choice as Katharine Hepburn, and she really has fun with the role, turning out a great performance that was both accurate and a bit teasing, something that the real life Hepburn probably would have admired. Alan Alda is ridiculously great as Senator Brewster, and Kate Beckinsdale is a believable Ava Gardner. She definitely has a sensual poise about her that is so hard to come by. John C. Reilly is great as Noah Dietrich (his confusion at Howard's behavior yet his sympathy for him was spot on). I didn't really understand the inclusion of Alec Baldwin as Juan Tripp, but he does have that somewhat slimy feel that translates well into that type of a manipulative role. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was great. There are a couple scenes in which people might feel slightly uncomfortable or disturbed, such as the sequence in the screening room, but they're necessary to carry the movie and understand the character and his madness, and they're a great example of DiCaprio's acting talents and the fact that he's fearless in becoming his character. Even if you might go ""ew, what the heck?"" during those, this movie isn't so much about being pretty (even though it is) as it is about contrasting the public persona and legend of Howard Hughes with the private one, and it succeeds wonderfully."

(Oliver Stone DIDN'T make it, Martin Scorcese did, so there IS a better chance it honors the truth!) We've ALL heard about Hughes' final, reclusive, CRAZY years, but ""The Aviator"" covers the majority of his years before he lost himself to what I'm sure would now be labeled ""Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder"". The story immediately takes a peek at his childhood, where an important issue is clarified, and we then dive right into his start with aviation. We see his mind working 1,000 miles per hour, flying in 4 directions at a time, and NEVER shooting down ideas. He gambles everything, often, and fights for what he gets. He's no namby-pamby rich boy. You have to admire him, even if you DON'T want to be in his hire. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job, as does Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Gwen Stefani, and Alec Baldwin. The dirty business of politics & payoffs is covered, but so is the glorious, imaginative efforts of Hughes and his engineers. Special effects are excellent, photography is exciting, dialog always interesting, sets & costumes rich with era, scoring greatit's all-around solid character study, and recreation of an era that is worth another look.

"Skragg","9","0","0","5 October 2005"," Extremely well-done (though probably with a lot of artistic license)
","I've never been attached to a Scorcese film, and I barely know Leonardo DiCaprio from Adam, so I had no real prejudices about this one. (I have always had a great interest in Howard Hughes, but that could just as easily make me prejudiced AGAINST this one as FOR it.) But I think it really worked, almost completely. One half-way small thing is the music. I've always had a real hang-up about ""period"" movies (and others) that have songs squeezed edgewise into them.For instance, there's Scorcese's own ""Goodfellas"". I like strange things worked into movies (to put it mildly), but even I couldn't enjoy the idea of a MAFIA movie that uses ""Atlantis"" as the music for a mob killing scene, or ""Layla"" as its closing music! But when I see the credits of a movie, and see a dozen songs that I don't remember hearing, that's a good thing, because it means they were worked into it in a half-way subtle way. And that's what happened in The Aviator - apart from the nightclub songs, and a few others, the ' 20s - ' 40s music was worked in pretty casually. I think about the only thing that went against DiCaprio physically was height (Howard Hughes was almost 6 ft. 4), but that's a small enough problem. As for that look that someone described as an ""I've got to get to a men's room"" look, I think it was just a properly ""intense"" one. And again, I have no axe to grind about him as an actor. And Kate Beckinsall (sp.), someone else I don't really know at all, was really great, in such an ""understated"" way, as Ava Garner, especially in that one big scene, where she more or less brings him out of his isolation (I couldn't really care less whether that episode is true or not). And Alec Baldwin as Trippe, and Alan Alda (someone I AM pretty prejudiced about) as Brewster. In that one line, where he asks if he's ""ON the committee, or CHAIRMAN of the committee?"", he sounds like a little kid hinting at a favor, instead of a slick politician, in other words, perfectly ""disingenuous."" And Cate Blanchette was great as Katherine Hepburn (though in some ways maybe less so than the actress Tovah Feldshuh in the TV movie with Tommy Lee Jones, though I don't think many people here would agree with that). Someone mentioned the overdone ""CGI"" effects, and I'm usually the first to be put off by that, but I think they WEREN'T overdone in this film, and were genuinely great in the filming-of-Hell's Angels scenes. Though I agree with one person here about that plane crash scene - I don't think it was unintentionally comical, but it was still overdone. Someone mentioned the movie unfairly blaming his mother for his phobias, and that might be true, but I know that Clifford Irving, in his infamous fake autobiography, mentions Mr. Hughes getting some of his ideas about hygiene from his mother, and I know that that fake autobiography used a lot of REAL facts (though I don't know whether that was one of them). I think The Aviator really worked, including the really unsettling last scene."

Most memorable line for me is Hepburn's 'people like us are different' summing up the double-edged sword that is celebrity based on eccentric genius. Scorsese's description of Hughes' battle to save his reputation in the face of big business backed politicians makes him a sympathetic hero, and perhaps most wonderful of all is how the director would have us judge Howard Hughes by his great achievements, rather than his notorious image. He may not be a conventional hero in the Hollywood style, but this story of genius oppressed by disability and judged by a media more interested in a story than the facts can only do credit to the memory of the much maligned millionaire."

","The Aviator finds Scorsese back at close to top form after some of the disappointment that attended The Gangs Of New York (2002). This is partly because in Howard Hughes the director has once again found a driven, flawed character such has typically appeared in his most successful work. Like a Travis Bickle, Henry Hill, or Jake La Motta, Hughes is another self-tortured soul on the way to a dramatic end, a journey whose effects are orchestrated by a filmmaker currently at the height of his powers. And unlike the narrative weaknesses which informed his previous film, The Aviator has a strong story line with a coherent and compelling sweep, one which takes events down several decades with ease. The Academy obviously thought so, as the film won five out of its 11 Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>At centre of Scorsese's biopic is reclusive flyer, aircraft designer, film producer, eccentric lover, and multi-millionaire obsessive-compulsive Hughes, whose colourful career surely provides enough material for a dozen films. He's been portrayed before of course: notably by Tommy Lee Jones (The Amazing Howard Hughes, 1977), and Jason Robards (Melvin And Howard, 1980), and others. But none of these previous incarnations had the benefits of Scorsese's budget or his undeniable cinematic flair. Combined, they make for compelling viewing as we see Hughes' private life and career rise and soar, before entering the turbulent years of rivalry with Pan-Am over the transatlantic aero market and the entrepreneur's increasing mental problems. Indeed, part of the fun of Scorsese's film lies in the symptom-watching, judging just when the hero famously tips over the edge, anticipating his future years hidden away in shrouded hotel rooms with long nails and matted hair. (This viewer has it when Hughes raises his hand into the air, as if suddenly noticing germs, during a late screening of Hell's Angels). Scriptwriter John Logan co-wrote Gladiator, and so he's well used to organising a larger-than-life central character, while his writing on RK280 (1999), an account of the genesis of Citizen Kane, showed an informed and affectionate interest in the legendary tales of Hollywood. Like Welles did with Kane, Logan places the origin of Hughes' personality quirks firmly in his childhood, and includes a suggestive opening scene neatly encapsulating obsession, cleanliness, and aberrant sexuality.<br/><br/>Some critics have felt that the director could profitably spent more time on Hughes' years as a recluse, but this would have meant a different, longer, and perhaps less satisfying film. In fact Leonardo DiCaprio's performance remains strongest when relating to others. His moments alone in his room, while dramatically necessary, are arguably weaker than when the declining Hughes interacts with disturbed intimates, although even in this isolation Scorsese gives madness a fascination of its own.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's acting is to be commended in a film covering such ambitious ground, and is generally successful. One is reminded of Giant (1956), a film in which another youthful actor, James Dean, is called to play a character ageing over a span of years. Like Dean, DiCaprio is perhaps still too fresh faced be entirely convincing as a mature man, but its only a minor distraction. In fact this is the best he's been for some time, proof further that under Scorsese's guidance the actor is doing his finest work. The director certainly has no reservations about DiCaprio having already announced his starring part in a new gangster project, 'The Departed'. A fine supporting cast, notably Cate Blanchett as Hughes' main infatuation Katherine Hepburn - the only woman who apparently gave him a run for his money - and a still sprightly Alan Alda, marvellous as scheming Senator Brewster, helps matters along considerably.<br/><br/>Inevitably in a film titled The Aviator, there's a lot of flying and chat about planes. Fortunately, Hughes thought big, and his outlandish projects (including one seaplane the 'Spruce Goose' the biggest ever built and which hardly flew) are eye candy in themselves, while Scorsese revels in the enthusiasm and drive which Hughes brought to his projects. Indeed Hughes is seen taking almost sensual pleasure in the smooth fuselage of his prototype aircraft, his hands feeling for the flush rivets with the same suspenseful concentration as he had earlier seducing a waitress in a club. In fact one senses that Hughes 'flies' his sexual conquests with the same daredevil and rocky approach as that with which he conquers the skies, as his career runs a fine balance between business and obsessive pleasure, risk and enterprise. The inevitable smash-ups, personal or mechanical, when they occur are well done whilst the surrounding intrigues of Hughes' life, whether in the studio, bedroom or congressional committee provide more than adequate distractions from any mundane aspects of aircraft engineering. In Scorsese's hands ultimately the 'aviator' of the title becomes more than a flyer; it becomes the defining mark of a man who took risks, lived too fast, perhaps rose too high until, Icarus like, he was doomed to collapse back.<br/><br/>If there's a criticism of Scorsese's film it is that a good deal of the real life Hughes' more unpalatable character has been suppressed. Like Ford's Young Mr Lincoln (a film which Scorsese admires), there is an occasional air of hagiography about the man in earliest days, a visionary blessed by his personal integrity. But history tells us that this was someone who was a serial seducer of starlets (a characteristic made more palatable here), was rabidly anti-communist, and hated blacks. Clearly a lot of the extreme Hughes was jettisoned to make him a more sympathetic character but, sometime, there is still yet room for a rabid anti-biography."

","Scorsese for me has always been one of those directors capable of bringing together actors of all different backgrounds and character and working them into a story effortlessly. His grasp of direction is usually flawless, artistic but always controlled. Yet he has never, again for me, produced a single piece of work I would call complete despite some fantastic performances from various actors.<br/><br/>This is yet another in the long list of 'so close'.<br/><br/>The film is good, great by many standards. But the story is weak, even if the central character is engrossing (and Di Caprio - who hasn't had a good role since Gilbert Grape - shows at last some of his talent by giving a great performance) and the supporting cast so strong. It just isn't carried anywhere (few biopics ever are though, ""Chaplin"" really is the only one that springs to mind).<br/><br/>I do recommend it, I rate it highly enough to give it a 7 and the closing half an hour is great - but there's no ending to speak of."

","If I wrote the tagline for this movie, it would read something like ""The Best Movie This Year about Someone Insignificant!"" You may argue that Howard Hughes was some sort of pioneer in the histories of both the movie and aviation, but I would reply that if Howard Hughes was not around to accomplish those things, someone else equally unimportant would have. I give credit that this movie accurately portrays Hughes as both a risk-taker and downright weirdo, was beautifully filmed, and very well acted. But I can't get past the fact that Howard Hughes was likely only well known because he was very wealthy, and a person whose quirks only make him an irritating nut who treated other people poorly, and recklessly threw millions of dollars away chasing white rabbits (or rather Spruce Gooses). From the movie, I didn't see that he was all that noble, not enough for us to sympathize with him and regard him as some sort of hero. This was certainly a very well-made film, deserving of accolades for its technical aspects, but ultimately whose subject really doesn't matter."

","Billionaire entrepreneur,raconteur and legend Hoawrd Hughes led two lives. One,as a handsome,charismatic young dreamer who was able to spin gold out of straw,creating planes that worked and movies that sold. The other was the OCD-hobbled eccentric who furiously bucked the system he also wanted to serve. The bridge between these two is explored in Martin Scorcese's nearly three hour long epic.<br/><br/>Leonard DiCaprio's Hughes makes up for a physical lack of authenticity(he stays fairly boyish looking through two decades of change,including after surviving a life-threatening plane crash!)by being able to commit to the passion and affliction that was Howard. His willingness to sacrifice his body and portray a mental illness that is somewhat difficult to encapsulate is nothing short of remarkable. <br/><br/>HAving said that,probably the real standout here was CAte Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. I suppose it betrays a lack of movie sophistication to admire an actor for their ability to mimic a real celebrity(and my familiarity with KAte may not be THE best) but it's still hard to forget ones that are dead-on(Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison comes to mind)and Blanchet's KAte Hepburn is just that! Her vocal cadence,speed of talking and her general demeanor of defiance seemed to so mark Miss Hepburn's persona. She is a unique person for her era and she is very aware of it,and her being different is at least in part why she can recognize and love Howard for his quirks and style.<br/><br/>The heavies are a senator from Maine(Alan Alda,very good here)and the President and CEO of Pan-Am Airlines(Alec Baldwin,not especially memorable but still serviceable),the latter having the former in his deep,influential pockets. The tricks that they play on Hoawrd's state of mental health SEEM minor,but are actually quite insidious and snide(e.g.blowing cigar smoke his direction,leaving fingerprints on his drinking glass,serving food bloody and rare). <br/><br/>The rest of the cast rounds out nicely with John C. Reilly(as NOah Dietrich,Howard's longtime bookkeeper and friend),Adam Scott(as JOhnny,Howard's longtime associate and confidant),KAte Beckingsale(as Ava GArdener,who also had a short and tempestuous affair with Mr.HUghes),Gwen Stefani(appropriate as Jean HArlow),MAtt Ross,Kelli Garner,and Brent Spiner. Cameos by Jude Law and Willem DaFoe catch the eye but have only small impact on the film.<br/><br/>While I cannot quite call this film a classic,it is still a very worthy movie to watch,especially if you are interested in 20th-Century American history and the impact of celebrity has on it. Also,Mr.Hughes' life is very fascinating,IMHO. The title line of my review isn't to say that I believe that Mr. Hughes and C.F.Kane's(proxy to W.R.Hearst) life stories are direct parallels,but that the aim of both movies seems to be the same. Namely,the documenting of a great,brilliant man whose sense of ego and frailty become to(greater or lesser degrees)his undoing. While lacking full originality,either in subject or approach, it still is able to evoke interest and personality,which makes the awards it was nominated for(And the relative few that it won)quite deserving."

","This is a truly lavish and wonderful movie about a large portion of the life of American original, Howard Hughes. I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I must admit that here he does his subject proud. It is hard to imagine anyone else in this role; DiCaprio becomes Hughes, and, especially toward the close of the film, is an eerie Hughes double.<br/><br/>The period settings and wardrobe are perfect to the least detail. The actual color used in the movie emulates color processes used during the times depicted. This type of loving handling is what we have come to expect of Scorcese, and he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The picture has a sterling and quite watchable supporting cast, all of whom, save one, perform wonderfully . Kate Beckinsale is a fine Ava Gardiner, Alec Baldwin is suavely evil as the insidious Juan Trippe, Alan Alda exudes slime as Sen. Brewster, and small appearances, almost cameos, by Brent Spiner, Willem Dafoe, Ian Holm, and others all bring home the class nature of this production.<br/><br/>Only one failure in the the cast: the performance of Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. Blanchett handles Hepburn as ham-handedly as hammy. It is as if she never saw a Kate Hepburn movie or interview and had no knowledge at all of how Hepburn looked, sounded, or acted. One is relieved once Blanchett is off screen, not blemishing what is otherwise a great production.<br/><br/>Like so many biopics, this one tells us little of Hughes' motivations or character. By and large, this omission does not prevent us from enjoying the movie. Hughes insanity is a bit overplayed and many of his accomplishments are overshadowed by the picture's obsession with his mental breakdown. The director even borrows a bit from A Beautiful Mind, inviting us to question whether certain characters Hughes sees on screen are really there.<br/><br/>I give this picture 8 stars out of 10; it would have captured 9 but for Blanchett's embarrassing ""performance""."

","The Aviator.<br/><br/>A somewhat hard picture to judge. Overall I would say I enjoyed it. But then again, most Scorcese stuff will never be garbage, or never really be uninteresting. To be honest I thought The Aviator was a more interesting story than Raging Bull. Maybe because stories about boxers never interested me. Maybe that's why I think The Aviator was a far better film than Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>So the Aviator is a sub-par epic, by an incredible filmmaker and storyteller. The production values, acting, etc etc are excellent. The story of Hughes is just too sad and screwed up to be as memorable as something like Goodfellas or Taxi Driver. The movie isn't just well done because its a Martin Scorcese movie and people automatically give it props, it is definitely worth seeing. He's mastered elegant, original storytelling, I just think the angle to take on someone like Howard Hughes was the only misstep in the film. <br/><br/>Maybe I have a weird lust for long epic movies, but the ending just felt so unsatisfying. Because the movie makes his character seem to interesting, and the film just ends when he's what? 40. If you become engaged in the story (as I did), You end up thinking..."" do I have to read a Howard Hughes biography to know what madness, and ridiculously admirable ambition and...more madness came to this guy for the rest of his life??!?"" I guess so. <br/><br/>I think the ultimate annoyance people had with the movie is...its ability to showcase Howard Hughes massive weirdness, but nobody really feels empathetic to it. It's like watching some ranting homeless guy downtown rant on about the government and society. You know that he might actually be making some sense, and he might be right, but you still want to beat him until he shuts up and stops acting so ridiculously strange. There's a very minute audience that kind find empathy for germaphobes. The empathy for his struggle against pretty obvious government misconduct in his business, is diminished by our lack of empathy for his eccentricity. <br/><br/>DiCaprio was fantastic though. Probably the strongest performance of his career. Scorcese not winning the Oscar seems...unfair but almost just. The academy has a very stubborn manner of reflecting its honors on those who are making their best work, not work of brilliance, but declining brilliance. Clint Eastwood was making his best work as a director, and Scorcese well...his work in Goodfellas was worth two Oscar's...but his work on Aviator wasn't quite worth one."

For me, I would have loved to see 1980 Scorcese tackle this project and do what he does best which is draw out the raw, gritty human emotion of the story.

","In ""The Aviator,"" Scorcese has nailed the period--20s to 40s--flawlessly. As for the liberties he took with actual history, well, this be the movies, right? As such, his depiction, swaggering and swanky, like the celebrities populating the time period, was picture perfect. <br/><br/>DiCaprio, as Howard Hughes, gave us what we wanted, a bigger than life, more paranoid than most, character, as full of himself as he was, deep inside, wary of others. Cate Blanchett, as Kate Hepburn in her successful years, nearly stole the show, playing Kate as a tomboyish, extremely confident mistress, well aware of her stardom and not about to take crap from anyone, inclusive of Hughes, whom she dropped like the proverbial three foot putt when his idiosyncrasies begin to surface. Whenever Blanchett was on screen, one was drawn to her, DiCaprio's Hughes waning in her presence. <br/><br/>Scorcese set the pace of the movie on par with an airplane taking off, never letting up on the throttle. In one amazing sequence he showed Hughes crash-landing one of his planes during a test flight, giving us a variety of points of view, inclusive of that of Beverly Hills homeowners watching the plane's wings cut through their homes like a knife blade through tissue paper. <br/><br/>Having the mystical yet infamous Hughes as a story source provided Scorcese with more than enough fodder, and credit goes to the director for not presenting a four-hour epic. In addition, the deftly-crafted manner in which he incorporated the well-documented idiosyncrasies that ultimately led Hughes into total self-imposed isolation allowed DiCaprio the room to play the character both enigmatic and sad. <br/><br/>Much to Scorcese's credit, he left this viewer wondering, as I did when Hughes was the living legend, how a guy with that much moxie and drive and courage could fall prey to paranoid obsessions that turned him into a recluse? <br/><br/>The film reminded me of ""Tucker: The Man and his Dream,"" which starred Jeff Bridges in the lead role. Both films present their protagonists as near supermen, with each ultimately cut down to size by opposing forces, both external and internal. Both films are enjoyable quasi-documentaries, and I recommend this double-bill to one and all."
"monkeeking","Null","0","0","28 March 2005"," View it with an open mind to what the filmmakers intended.
","""The Aviator"" is director Martin Scorsese's ambitious biographical account of Howard Hughes' life as a wealthy director-cum-aviator in the late 1920's through the 40's, with Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes.<br/><br/>The film begins with Hughes already embroiled in his first motion picture, ""Hell's Angel's"", a war-drama that took four years to produce and was re-shot due to the discovery of audio! For its time it was the most expensive film ever produced. Hughes, after making a few more features, mainly focused his attentions on his airline corporation.<br/><br/>DiCaprio skillfully portrays a young wealthy man brimming with confidence and inspiration. His acting goes to new heights as he depicts Hughes' struggle with his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Alan Alda as a corrupt Senator (on the payroll of Hughes' detractors) and Cate Blanchett as the late Katharine Hepburn, who was one among many of Hughes's love interests. Blanchett gave a performance that was Hepburn in every way. What was more exceptional about Blanchett's performance was that she went beyond what we saw of Hepburn. Blanchett brings emotions and humanity to a person who led quite a secluded life for a star of such status.<br/><br/>This lengthy biopic, abounding with vibrant characters and embracing a massive scope, loses sight of its goal or any overall vision and begins to wander about aimlessly. What we have left is a skeleton of what was first presented to us. I'm not criticizing Scorsese for sparing us emotional crying scenes. For this I admire him since his pictures tend to be darker and more insightful towards the lives of those who hold power and then lose it in a downward spiral because of their own faults (similar to classic Shakespearian tragedies). Once Hughes hits rock-bottom Scorsese lets us linger in his insane private world for too long. The acting suffers from this since DiCaprio repeats himself during these sequences. All that is left is the beautiful cinematography and score. Scorsese does finally attempt to rekindle the excitement at the end when Hughes successfully flies a mammoth plane (which took years to build) and is also brought to Senate hearings for allegedly wasting government aeronautics funds during World War II. All of which comes too late to salvage our interest. After it's all over the story is wrapped up with Hughes descending further into paranoia and seclusion. He ultimately became a recluse until his death in 1976 from a kidney failure.<br/><br/>What is ""The Aviator's"" goal? We initially think it's to accurately portray the life of Howard Hughes, who was a very powerful and mysterious figure in society. This can't be so since Hughes is said not to have been so affected by his disorder during the period which the film is set. Also, the attention given to Katharine Hepburn is strange considering her relationship with Hughes was brief and he was also involved with countless leading ladies. Is it because Hepburn died recently? All of it suggests that the film is less fact oriented and is actually motivated by its message's significance, which in the end is left to each viewer's interpretation.<br/><br/>View it with an open mind to what the filmmaker's intended.

","To all who are going to go and see this movie, please keep an open mind beforehand, as it is the story of only a part of Howard Hughes' life and cannot be expected to cover his entire life and career. However, what it does cover is done superbly, and for this, thanks must go to Leonardo de Caprio (absolutely brilliant as Hughes) and Cate Blanchett (who fully deserved her Oscar as Katharine Hepburn) in particular - they are brilliant, and once again de Caprio builds on his stunning performances in ""Gangs of New York"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" - the very complex Hughes would have been a real challenge for anyone, but de Caprio nailed it. The supporting cast which includes Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner) and Jude Law (he even looks like Errol Flynn) are all fascinating performances - do not let some critics deter you from Seeing ""The Aviator"" - it is long but intriguing, but, boy oh boy, what a place Hollywood must have been in the 30's."

","Despite the hype attached to this picture, the Motion Picture Academy made the right decision for once in awarding best picture to ""Million Dollar Baby"" and best director to Clint Eastwood. ""The Aviator"" is certainly cinematic. All the major roles are exceptionally well acted. The film's weakness lies in the direction and editing. The picture drags in a number of places, particularly in the scenes intended to show that Howard Hughes is one weird fellow. The idea could have been conveyed equally well with fewer scenes and considerably less footage. I have to wonder whether the movie would have been equally interesting if it were fiction instead of biography populated with figures like Hughes himself, Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Juan Trippe (who ran Pan Am), Senator Owen Brewster of Maine and Noah Dietrich, Hughes' principal aide, not to mention more minor figures (for purposes of the picture) like Jean Harlow, Louis B. Mayer, Errol Flynn. My guess is that it would not have been half as interesting as pure fiction. Part of the charm is watching actors like DiCaprio, Blanchette, Beckinsale, Baldwin, Alda, and Reilly impersonate real people that I personally remember. My bottom line: Martin Scorcese fumbled this by being overly preoccupied with the pictorial elements and insufficiently ruthless in the editing process."

","Characters were very reminiscent of the real life personalities. The character of Katherine Hepburn was play to near perfection. I can't help but think Howard Hughes in real life was a bit of a cad, and hard to deal with. He pursued women on a constant basis with a single mindedness for sex. How women put up with him could only be attributed to his wealth. Little else was attractive from him. His wealth and his preoccupation with cleanliness isolated him in a world of his own making which had little to do with ordinary life patterns. This was part of his genius and his devastating spiral into a lonely worthless existence."

","No, it's not the greatest film ever and both Ray and MDBaby both outdid it...but I came away with a greater respect for DiCaprio than I expected. After he seemed so wrong for the part in Gangs I wondered about his suitability for Howard Hughes. Between makeup and his hard work I came to believe he really WAS the reclusive Hughes. I'd be interested to know how many of the aircraft were real and how much was CGI. If you can find a more realistic special effects gig than the neighborhood crash of his spy plane I'd like to see it. Thought the switching from outdoor to indoor perspectives was convincing. There was something about the continuity of the film that left me wondering if Hughes just fell in and out of these paranoid fugues. One minute he's the Naked Unshaved Beast and then Ava has him spiffied up jousting with Congress. Jude Law and Alec Baldwin were useless high-priced additions that could have been used elsewhere."

I was very surprised that Aviator didn't win best picture. I didn't see the other films, but I thought this film was utterly perfect, certainly by classic Hollywood film standards - it gave no more, nor held anything back than it should have.

While in no way a thorough docudrama of Howard Hughes' life (I recommend viewers at least read the IMDb biographic details of him before seeing the movie) we get a good insight into his complex nature, aspirations and mental problems. His two most most extravagant projects, the movie ""Hells Angels"" and the Hercules aircraft get the major attention as we would expect, but it is a pity that his role in producing ""Scarface"" receives only passing mention. Unfortunately I agree with those who say Leonardo di Caprio was the wrong person to cast as Hughes, but he does put in a good performance, while everyone else is superb; I particularly liked Alec Baldwin.

"valadas","7","0","0","3 March 2005"," Crazy movie
","And the story is also that of a crazy man, the famous millionaire Howard Hughes who had a tremendous initiative power always acting stubbornly against all tides and winds to achieve his aims. Besides a great businessman he also excelled in such different activities as plane driver and movie director. Crazy and unpredictable but also a human being with all the respective frailties and idiosyncrasies. In my opinion DiCaprio was not a good choice for this character since his boyish appearance and manners make the character very unconvincing. It would require a more strong personality such as of De Niro or Liam Neeson for instance. And a curious note: the portrayed characters never get physically older. All of them during the about 30 years in which the story develops itself, keep the same physical aspect which they had at their first appearance including the main character after all those vicissitudes he had to endure. Also the sudden changes of Hughes from sanity to insanity and back are not well characterized or explained, with DeCaprio revealing himself a mediocre actor once more. But except these flaws the movie is well done, the story is solid and sound and its events develop themselves in a good rhythm and the music is excellent. The scenes of the Senate Committee hearings are also a high moment in the movie. After all this movie is worth to be seen."
"MatBrewster","8","0","0","26 February 2005"," A Technical Genius, on a Technical Genius
","I have been a fan of Martin Scorcese since I have been serious about film. His films are intelligent, technically brilliant, and artful. He causes us to meditate on characters we'd rather forget, or shuffle to the back of society and our minds. His movies are often tough, meaty films that take a great deal to work through. His films have never been as popular as contemporaries like Spielberg or Lucas. But he doesn't seem to mind, nor do his fans. While these other filmmakers soar to the heavens and look for the good in people, Scorcese seems to dig into the trenches, and inhabit the rough sticky worlds that inhabit the low lives of troubled men. He seems interested in why people live violent, hurtful lives. He is...well many other people have praised his work far better than I can.<br/><br/>I have seen every Scorcese picture in the theatre since Kundun. Each time I venture into his films I come with high expectations. I know an excellent Scorcese picture is a true treasure, something to behold and love. I was well pleased to see that the Aviator was playing here in France in version originale, or with an English language track.<br/><br/>Scorcese pictures are always a technical marvel. And the aviator does not disappoint in this category. In post production, he manipulated the colors of the film to mirror production scales of the time period being represented. In early scenes the colors are ""two-tone Technicolor"" then evolve into ""three-tone Technicolor"" and on to full scale color by the films end. The flight sequences are spectacularly shot. Scorcese is such a master of the technical aspects of film making that he makes even the most difficult shots look easy.<br/><br/>I have been a closet Leonardo DiCaprio fan for many years. It is difficult to admit this in mixed company because of the general distaste for the actor. Since Titanic drove a million adolescents wild, it seems no serious fan of the cinema can admit admiration of the actor (except for people like Steven Spielberg and Scorcese who keep putting him into their pictures). Yet, I continue to find him to be an actor of excellence. He does a marvelous job here, portraying a complex, fascinating human.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett does a pitch perfect job as Katherine Hepburn, one of the many Hollywood romances of Howard Hughes. Ms Hepburn was such a caricature herself, portraying her must have taken plenty of guts. It is a fine, outstanding performance.<br/><br/>Many people carry only a vague notion of Howard Hughes. We know that he was quite rich, lived a glamorous, flashy life as a young man and became a maniacal hermit in his old age. Pictures of a hunched, old man with long, white hair; an unkempt beard; unclipped, yellow toenails and boxes on his feet come to mind instantly whenever Hughes' name is mentioned. This is the Howard Hughes we have become fascinated by. Yet this aspect of Hughes' life is barely dealt with in Scorcese's picture. Yes, we catch many glimpses of the demons inside him, and we even capture a few weeks of isolation, but mostly Scorcese dwells on the younger man, full of life.<br/><br/>Though Scorcese is often fascinated with eccentric, crazed lives, it is rare for him to give any reason for the lives of his characters. We can tell that loneliness helps to bring Travis Bickel, in Taxi Driver, over the bring. We see greed and violence begetting more violence in films such as Goodfellas and Raging Bull. But these things are only the beginnings of why they behave in such reprehensible ways. Preferring to allow his films to be questions, Scorcese never fully gives us answers. The Aviator, also, give us hints to what may have driven Howard Hughes to such madness, but it never fully explains his actions. We see hints of a protective mother, and surely his drive to control every aspect of his life helped him become obsessive compulsive. Yet these things are not answers, more symptoms to the overall problem. Scorcese is more interested in the behavior of his characters. The nuances of their actions, and the subsequent damage it causes. You won't find cookie cutters to make you feel better about life in this film, but you'll find a meditation on a brilliant, troubled man. If you care to dig a little deeper, you might be moved."

","Scorsese's best film. Ever. Tour de force and bravura film-making that stays true to the subject and milieu of late 1920s-1940s Hollywood. Keep watching the film and realize the faithfulness Scorsese pays to Hughes' vision, as if it were one of the mogul's pictures. It's not as though Scorsese is like Howard Hughes (like some critics have stated), but one can still be memorized by his genius-- and seems as though it caught Scorsese to make the picture. I wish things worked out better for Hughes, but he left us with paving the ""way of the future."" Hats off to DiCaprio (as I also thought was under-appreciated in This Boys Life; Canton-Jones, 1993), who assiduously perfects Hughes unusual behavior. I admire that Scorsese left us with as a positive, albeit complex portrayal of a 20th Century wonder. Way to go Marty. Total highway robbery at the Oscars; without saying, it deserved best directing and best picture.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to understand Hollywood politics; what do they have against Marty? Could be that he's so independent like Hepburn, yet she won 4 awards? Or maybe because he sympathized with Hughes? Or maybe because it was the evening commemorating Lumet, and that would be insulting to him? Wrong, that's all I could say. I just don't know! Very wrong the film was not acknowledged. But you know what, neither was Apocalypse Now! In 50 years, we'll still be talking about The Aviator. 10 Stars; not Million Dollar Baby."

"jewelp24","8","0","0","27 February 2005"," Good, but a little too long
","When I went to see this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I knew close to nothing about the life of Howard Hughes, so I can't judge the accuracy of the film. As the movie started, I wasn't incredibly impressed. It was good, and it was interesting, but I didn't see a lot of the things that, in my opinion, qualify a movie to be nominated for Best Picture. DiCaprio's performance was good, but Hughes seemed to be glorified and his character was kind of inhuman. But as the film went on, I began to notice little things about his character...""eccentricities"" as they are called in the movie, which were the beginning of obsessive compulsive disorder. As time passed, you could see the OCD getting worse. But the part of the film that really got to me was when he ended up locked in his screening room, naked, unwilling to touch anything for fear of germs. The cinematography in this scene, and moreover, DiCaprio's performance, made it possible to see exactly how this character felt. The thing that didn't seem plausible to me was how quickly the character recovered from this. Although in the end he relapsed, it didn't seem possible for him to go from complete isolation to contact with thousands of people in such a short time. However, DiCaprio's performance was compelling; I really felt for his character and it would be difficult to make such a big character who lived such an amazing life seem human. Cate Blanchett was also very good as Katherine Hepburn. It was a difficult role to play, but she was very believable. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was its length. I don't normally have a problem with long movies; in fact, I feel that the reason so few good movies are made these days is because most are too short for real character development. And the length of this movie was necessary for Hughes' character to be developed. But parts of the film seemed disjointed, which made it seem longer than it actually was. If it had've flowed together better, the length would not have been a problem for me. Overall, though, I felt that the film was surprisingly good. Considering how commercial the film is, I was surprised at how well made it was."

","The best film of 2004 is a throw back to old Hollywood and has the visuals to back it up. Martin Scorsese directs his most ambitious film to date that will rank as one of his best in the history of his career. Scorsese doesn't use his quintessential style that audiences are used to from his early days in the film industry. Instead, Scorsese's approach to the material here, while unsentimental as his films usually are, is totally majestic in style and matches the maverick personality of it's protagonist Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio). DiCaprio is brilliant as the aviation pioneer, industrialist and film maker who always did things while thinking big in typical American fashion and while he was deeply flawed as a person, he prevented a monopoly in the airline industry that perhaps prevented other monopolies from taking place and saved the true American spirit of competition from being destroyed. Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn and Alan Alda as a corrupt senator add to the support of this film that, along with DiCaprio's performance, make it the grand epic that it will be remembered for. A true classic!"

","Leonardo DiCaprio has been the biggest teen heartthrob in the last ten years. Not even Brad Pitt or The Backstreet Boys have made young girls scream as loud as they have over DiCaprio. Over the last several years, though, he has been playing some mature and quality roles that have pulled him out of the image of a pretty boy and into the image of a real actor. In is latest film, he stars as Howard Hughes, a man who probably one of the most eccentric and misunderstood figures of the 20th century. It is hard to believe that this is the same Leo who played the twelve year old brat in Titanic. The Aviator is directed by Martin Scorsese, who, in the opinion of this ""critic"", is one of the greatest American directors of the last 30 years. His films are dark, intense, uncompromising, and are unlike most other Hollywood movies. This film is more light-hearted than his other movies, but it is still not without its morbid side. The movie is told in chronological order, starting in the 1920s, with Howard Hughes' project in the making his movie called Hell's Angels. Immediately we see his obsession with perfection. The film is costing the company millions of dollars, but that does not bother Hughes one bit, for he wants to give the audience a perfect film. He re shoots expensive scenes, and then re shoots the entire movie in sound. The obsession with perfection is what ultimately will lead to his downfall. As the movie progresses, the audience is shown numerous bizarre behaviors by Hughes, including washing his hands until they start bleeding. This behavior seems harmless and humorous at first, but soon we realize it is serious business. Nonetheless, Scorsese tries to portray Hughes in the most optimistic way possible. In real life, Hughes became extremely reclusive, hardly communicating with anyone in the outside world. Legend has it that in the last years of his life, he had to be identified with his fingerprints when he died because no one had seen him in years. The film is not trying to be a tragedy, though, but rather uplifting in showing a man who fought off his psychological demons and produced some meaningful things in his lifetime. Scorsese shows Howard Hughes as both a combination of artist and architect. Not only was he a filmmaker, but a plane designer, and also an industrialist. He was a deeply flawed man; he had affairs, had obsessive behavior, and was burned badly in a plane crash. All of this did not stop him from producing quality work, including building the ""Spruce Goose"", the largest plane ever to fly. He was also able to defend himself in front of a Congressional hearing about aeronautical controversies that happened during World War 2. All in all, what is most impressive about this film is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance of a complicated man. The teen sensation once known as Leo is no more. He is developing into a real actor and is starting to produce some of the best work of his career. DiCaprio plays this role with convincing passion, and most movie lovers will forget that it is actually DiCaprio up there on the screen. This is a difficult task to do, considering it is coming from a guy who most people dismiss as a pretty boy with little talent. Nevertheless, Leonardo is not looking back, and from now on, he looks like he is going to keep on playing serious and important roles. The Aviator is nominated for a whopping eleven Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and most importantly, Best Picture. The movie will win some of these awards for sure, because the film community has been raving about it since it was released. It is still not a movie for everyone though. Some will most likely find it boring and tedious. Those who stick will find that is it a rewarding movie experience."

I have been thinking about it constantly over the past several days, which is as clear of a sign as any that the film affected me. When I saw the previews, I groaned at the selection of Leonardo di Caprio for the lead. It seemed like an incongruous choice, and one driven more by cloying studio bean-counters than by Scorcese, who has always built his films around iconic leading men. Leo shut me up in a hurry. He was brilliant.<br/><br/>As much as I wanted to anoint him after Gilbert Grape, his work since then has been solid but not extraordinary (Titanic, Iron Mask, the Beach, Gangs of New York). He never quite convinced me that he had the gravitas to carry a film. He started to win me over in Catch Me If You Can. In the Aviator, he simply blew me away.<br/><br/>This is a movie that has everything you would expect from Scorcese, and there are several terrific performances, but clearly this is Leo's film. It is a three-hour showcase of an actor who is finally exploring the limits of his talent. I can now say without qualification that Leonardo di Carprio is a great actor.

On a side note, Leo is so lucky; he's gotten to have film sex with so many women, including Kate Winslet and Jennifer Garner, over the course of all his films (I think that's the primary reason he Executive Produces this, so he gets to do that more now that he can't play 17 anymore). Cate Blachett plays Katherine Hepburn with amazing accuracy. Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin both play believable rivals. John C. Reily, bless him, is a wonderful character actor that should be more appreciated (You've seen him in Chicago). Ian Holm plays Hughes's assistant (a weatherman) with enthusiasm and I enjoyed his sidekick part. Willem Dafoe even has a cameo part.<br/><br/>*SPOILER AHEAD*<br/><br/>This movie has some thrilling (and, when Leo gets completely thrashed in one colossal plane wreck, chilling) plane scenes and has a very good story to tell. Unfortunately, it doesn't tell it very well at some points. This movie clocks at a very long 2 hours and 46 minutes, but it feels longer than that. Martin Scorsese needs to hire some actual film editors for his nest movie, because it felt like he hired some giggling teenage girls that want to see Leonardo's naked scarred body 10 times in a row.<br/><br/>A very good story that would've been better had it been told a little bit faster and edited better. Length tiffs aside, this gets an A- and I'd advise you all to rent it so you can pause during the movie and do other stuff for awhile."
"druss44121-1","8","0","0","12 February 2005"," Scorsese doesn't disappoint
","The tagline proudly exclaims, ""Some men dream of the future. He built it."" It is not a lie. The name Howard Hughes is one probably known best by older generations, but the new biopic from Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas) may change all that. Clocking in at nearly three hours, not a minute is wasted as the admittedly quite amazing and very vivid life of Hughes is explored, both in the most public of his accomplishments and the most personal of his demons. Reminiscent of another famous biopic, Citizen Kane, it begins with Hughes as a boy, being warned of germs by his mother. His obsessive-compulsive disorder and phobia of germs would later take a much more central role in his life as he would grow.<br/><br/>Then, the story jumps right into the production of Hell's Angels. Only 21, the already rich Hughes (his father was an inventor) is directing his first film, a World War I epic. At one point, in order to get the camera shots he wants, dozens of fighter planes are whisked off into the air, with Hughes in one. It is the first aerial sequence of the film, and as Hughes stands up with his portable camera in hand in his flying vintage plane, a love for both aviation and film-making is evident, and it is a great ode to not only Howard Hughes but to all those who will risk everything for what they love to do. It is also Scorsese winking at his own heroes, and perhaps his own generation, too.<br/><br/>The film spans from the roaring 20s to the war torn 40s, and each age is recounted in vivid detail. The 20s in are particularly amazing, as singers croon to vast crowds of bygone partiers and Hollywood elite. It is almost as if the film were an actual time-capsule, capturing images that are not only recreated but authentic. Still, the story never becomes bogged down by the huge budget or grand visuals, and Hughes life only becomes more complex as the film continues. It is only in the last hour, really, that the film stumbles at all, as The Aviator ventures into the already much traveled territory of a biopic: the court battle. Here, lead by an appropriately repulsive Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Hughes is attacked by a corrupt system for, ironically, charges of corruption.<br/><br/>That's not to say any interest is lost, though, and if the greatest complaint of a film is that it is only the best at something that has been done before rather than good at something startling new, then it is not too severe of a complaint at all. In fact, some of what transpires within these hearings is enough to inspire an urge to find the actual old news reels of the genuine Howard Hughes hearings and to see every last detail of what was actually said. That is a great strength of the film overall, as everything it shows is just enough to give depth to the human character of Hughes while also enough to beckon one to seek out more long after the film is over. Hughes is a fascinating person, really, framed by a fascinating movie."

","I went to see this movie after the Oscar nominations, but before the actual Oscars were awarded. The Aviator got a lot of nominations and got good critics in many papers, so of course I went to the cinema with high expectations. The high expectations didn't help, but this movie was a let down to me. The filmography is nice. The music is OK, but not impressive. The story is quite nice to hear as I didn't know much about Howard Hughes. However the much appraised performance of Leonardo di Caprio is definitely not worth an Oscar in my view. Never in the movie did I feel any connection to the character of Howard Hughes. Halfway the movie I got the feeling that I was watching quite a mediocre movie. It did get better to the end, but still it left the feeling that I had watched a nice documentary of which I didn't really learn anything."

","I have a question for those who have seen the movie, and a correction on another comment.<br/><br/>In the car scene after the repeated ""Show me the blueprints"", there is a reflection in the driver's side window. It did not appear to me that the reflection was of DiCaprio. I think that it even could have been an old picture of Hughes. What was the reflection? Or was this just my faulty eyesight? Friends also saw the off reflection, so I'm inclined to believe that it's not just me. Is this an editing mistake? Is it possible that Scorsese slipped?<br/><br/>(Regarding another comment: Gwen Stefani is not ""Mediterranean"" by any stretch of the imagination. She may have naturally darker (read: not blonde) hair, but Carole Lombard's eyes and coloring were naturally as dark as Stefani's. Overall, I thought that the portrayal of the famous actresses--Lombard, K. Hepburn, and Ava Gardner--was stellar. Cate Blanchette was fantastic as Hepburn.)<br/><br/>Any and all assistance is greatly appreciated."

My opinion is that DiCaprio just isn't manly enough to realistically play Hughes. I thought that DiCaprio was miscast in Gangs of New York as well, but perfectly cast in Catch Me If You Can. Cate Blanchett is very clever as Kate Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale is wonderful as Ava Gardner. Alan Alda is a convincing arch rival and villain as Sen. Owen Brewster and although the flight scenes were fabulous it just wasn't enough. The movie is unquestionably good and cannot and should not be dismissed, but it left me feeling unfulfilled.

","Leonardo DiCaprio could have been SpiderMan. He could have been Anakin Skywalker. But instead he chose to be Howard Hughes. I suspect because he enjoys a challenge. Now, after seeing the film, I believe he not only rose to the occasion, but encapsulated every facet of the complex mind of Hughes; the sad and tormented man who became a legend.<br/><br/>The movie opens on the set of Howard Hughes' first film ""Hell's Angels"" and continues to follow him into the mid-forties. We see his womanizing, his staggering aeronautical ingenuity, his debilitated mental state, and eventually his U.S. government hearings. <br/><br/>A biopic is always harder for an actor than a regular picture because they cannot make any part of the character up; they can't fill in the gaps with fiction because whoever they are portraying is or was real. <br/><br/>Yet DiCaprio pulls off the performance like he knew Hughes, his wild eyes and accent show a smart businessman and at the same time allow a glimpse at the compulsive personality underneath. <br/><br/>The performance shows unrelenting honesty and depth of character (which is at least partly due to the real Hughes) in the deft changes throughout the film. You are allowed to see all sides of the mogul. <br/><br/>For instance, you may see him joy flying with Katherine Hepburn, sliding jokes into the character's witty banter like a normal person, but conversely the airplane's steering wheel is covered in cellophane because ""you'd be surprised what's on other peoples' hands."" Cate Blanchett, Gwen Stefani, and Kate Beckinsale also provide wonderful performances as the era's starlets.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, is being adorned with a nomination for Best Direction. Hopefully, the Academy will sift through the other movie makers and focus on the great direction of this film.<br/><br/>The dogfight sequences in the filming of ""Hell's Angels"" are broad in scope and move swiftly, but still manage to focus on Hughes in the cockpit of the camera plane complete with his own roll of film. Scorsese also uses light to illuminate certain important images and detach the audience from others. Darkness becomes synonymous with Hughes' insanity. These techniques blend well with the feel of the twenties, being a time piece. <br/><br/>This movie depicts an American icon completely, relying on the real Howard Hughes' external image and internal conflict; and the actors' and the director's eye for both bluntness and subtlety. The combination is explosive, exciting, saddening, and inspirational. ""The Aviator"" soars high above the rest!"

It's brilliantly shot, designed with spectacular direction from Scorsese and brilliant performances from the entire cast, especially DiCaprio, Alda and Blanchett but by the end of the film I half expected Hughes to see off his fears of dirt and disease in a cesspit before finding some new and crazy fear before locking himself in a room, stripping off slowly, drinking copious amounts of milk, taping his room into different sections, being met by Kate Beckinsale, who tells him he needs to get some clothes on before his big court appearance (which comes about because he has been spending ridiculous amounts of public money on planes bigger than the Empire State building which float but haven't actually got into the air yet), and then he, Phoenix like, rises from the ashes of his insanity to challenge the corrupt system and triumph for American freedom against that bastard of a senator, who looks like an older version of that guy from M*A*S*H before managing to get that insanely large plane off the ground and if you are still following this sentence, you've probably got an idea of how long this film seems to be.

","I really enjoyed The Aviator. Both in terms of story and acting, there was so much to look at and be entertained by. DiCaprio put in an excellent performance, the direction was generally very fine indeed, and the effects were almost perfect (I say ""almost"" because, when the Hercules carrier took off in the end, it was very obviously computer generated). The aviation scenes were absolutely spectacular. All in all an engrossing and pleasant old-fashioned epic which, in my opinion, deserves an 8 out of 10 rating.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett's Katherine Hepburn was perhaps a little over-acted, but it doesn't matter, because the entertainment value of the role was so great. In the end, she did come across as convincing.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner had a smaller role, which was a pity. She obviously became very intimate with Hughes, and in the movie we never really saw the two get to know each other. There was just a cut to a point when they were well into an established relationship. That was a little disappointing to me, because I really would have liked to see a larger role for Beckinsale. I think this role was one of her best yet. There was much more *character* in the Ava Gardner part than in any other role Beckinsale has had yet. Such fire in her eyes and expressions! (And, on a costuming note, what a stunning blue and red dress she wore in the scene where she helped Hughes recuperate from his solitary isolation!)<br/><br/>Returning to the story, the last part of the movie seemed a little unfinished to me. The hearing scenes with Hughes being questioned by the senator and upstaging him were good, but we weren't really shown the full consequences of it. I wanted to see more of the aftermath. Also, the whole thing with Hughes' neurotic disorder was never really commented on; never explained or analyzed. Sure, we saw the childhood scenes that must have started it, but why was there no medical interlude of any kind?<br/><br/>So, all things considered, not quite a perfect movie, but one I was fully engaged in and entertained by. That in itself is a rarity with new movies. I do hope The Aviator wins the Oscar for Best Movie. If you ask me, this is the kind of thing Scorsese should be doing, rather than all that boring and foul-mouthed mafia stuff."

","Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite directors. At least five of his movies (Taxi Driver  Raging Bull  Last Temptation of Christ  Goodfellas and Casino) are on top of my ""All-Time Favorite Movie List"". With raising expectation, I was waiting for a chance to watch his last opus ""The Aviator"", about a period of the life of the flamboyant and visionary Howard Hughes, who started building Drill-bits in Houston, TX and ended up in California, producing spectacular movies (and courting pretty movie starlets which he made famous), building futuristic planes and confronting head to head the giant (at that time) of commercial aviation PAN-AM. Yesterday, finally the chance arrived. What can I say: it's a wonderfully crafted and polished Hollywood product but I felt that something was definitely missing. Strong directions and cinematography, swift editing, jaw-dropping visual effects (the plane crash on Beverly Hills sequence is visually impacting and leaves you, at the end, totally devastated; cannot believe what nowadays computer graphics can do...), top-notch casting and production, very good acting especially by Leonardo DiCaprio, (who is ""getting better by the movie"" in spite of looking, in this one, a bit to boyish to credibly impersonate Howard Hughes), Cate Blanchett (amazing portrayal of a young Kate Hepburn which, however, I remember much prettier...please no offense), Alec Baldwin (one of the most slick and stylish villain in movie history) and Alan Alda (great performance which absolutely deserves a recognition). So what was really missing? I think this movie is missing a ""Soul"", that special ""something"" which touches you and somehow gets you involved, for good or for bad, while watching a movie. The one which can make you think, laugh or cry. The one that can give you the willies or, sometimes, even can make you feel like throwing pop-corn and stuff at the screen of your TV set. In short, that ""something"" that somehow gets to you and makes movie-watching such a fascinating experience! Even so called ""bad movies"" or ""B-Movies"" usually have it (I am a die-hard fan of those), but I couldn't feel it here. I was watching that marvelous and expensive display of cinematographic art, but I couldn't get emotionally involved and really relate to the characters or to the story unfolding on the screen. ...just watching and, I think, I even doze-off a couple of times (and I didn't even drink one beer...). Does this make it a bad movie? Of course not! This is a splendid movie. Perhaps only a ""not entirely perfect one"". It simply did not completely ""deliver"". By the way, this is simply my personal reaction and point of view as a spectator and movie lover and I truly think that ""The Aviator"" deserves (and certainly will receive) more then one ""Academy Award"". However, I would be surprised (and a bit disappointed), if it will receive an ""Oscar for Best Picture"". I think it should go to ""Closer"" instead, but.... who am I to judge...? Sorry Martin but, this time, I give it a 7 out of 10."

","As an aviation buff (and historian) I went in to the theater today to see The Aviator with a mixed bag of reservations, mostly surrounding the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as the legendary Howard Hughes. Was I every surprised and impressed at his portrayal of the famed aviator; he was in a word, mesmerizing.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what movie the people here who are complaining about Mr. DiCaprio or the movie's almost three hours running time, but he seemed to capture the essence of the Hughes character completely with his portrayal and while I could see where at least 10 minutes could have been cut, which would have resulted in an even better picture, not once did I think that The Aviator dragged in any way.<br/><br/>The transition in color, while something of a gimmick, worked for me. In watching the movie and now reviewing it in my mind as I write this, I compare it to two other epics, one obvious, one not; Tucker and Das Boat. The similarities between Tucker and The Aviator are obvious and I won't waste the space here as both tell the stories of misunderstood and eccentric industrialists with a sense of passion and compassion that is obvious. With Das Boat, one of my favorite movies, the comparison has more to do with the scope of the story and even a bit with the ballroom scenes. It's here where The Aviator falls a bit short in comparison. Maybe it's the substitution of CGI effects that leaves me a bit cold as it just seems less realistic than what Das Boat accomplished a generation ago with a proportionally smaller budget I'm sure.<br/><br/>I'm going to leave commentary on Mr. Scorcese's direction to others here far more qualified except to say that the movie was well-paced. Of his films I would have to say that this falls in behind Goodfellas and Raging Bull and ahead of Taxi Driver, but that's just one man's opinion.<br/><br/>Even with its flaws, this is a four stars out of four stars film, enjoyable and riveting at the same time, almost three hours of movie making magic.

"lawprof","9","4","12","27 December 2004"," A Biopic About a Very Brilliant But Very Disturbed Man
","Hollywood loves biopics and, judging from past and recent history, the more whacked-out the subject the more resources go into the film. It doesn't matter if the average moviegoer knows anything about the spotlighted character (as in ""A Brilliant Mind,"" how many knew about that Nobel Prize-winning genius?). Actually it may be an advantage to not sit there comparing recollected reality with silver screen confabulation.<br/><br/>In any event I doubt many people under sixty know much about rich inventor-cum-movie producer and director Howard Hughes. Hughes shifted gears from a fulsome dose of Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder (OCD) to full-blown madness decades before death released him from an affluent but miserable life.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is massively fascinated by Hughes and his sprawling film is a testament to the man's brilliance as well as his descent into tragically isolated insanity. Having cast Leonardo DiCaprio in the much overpraised ""Gangs of New York,"" he recruited this versatile actor, who owes his preeminence in Tinseltown to the runaway success of ""Titanic,"" to portray Hughes from his mid-1920s life as producer/director of the uber-over budget World War I aerial combat flick, ""Hell's Angels,"" to the late Forties.<br/><br/>As portrayed by DiCaprio, Hughes was a driven perfectionist. Nothing wrong with that in a surgeon but with a movie production there's a time to wrap it up and Hughes took years to reach that point. His obsession with detail, well reflected by DiCaprio, was simply an early and useful mirror of his increasingly handicapping OCD.<br/><br/>That movie's success brought gorgeous women flocking to his side but the most interesting liaison was with rising star Katharine Hepburn. Cate Blanchett inhabits Hepburn, a risky role when so many both remember the recently deceased icon and were mesmerized by her out-sized, bigger than life personality. Well Blanchett did it - no surprise. She inhaled Hepburn's clipped, staccato speech and her mannerisms, not all of which were always gentle or kind, even to loved ones. An Oscar nomination, I hope, will follow.<br/><br/>Hughes, an experienced but often reckless pilot, germinated ideas for novel aircraft design and he had the sense, the judgment to recruit the best minds to translate his concepts into operational models. Much of ""The Aviator"" focuses on Hughes's drive to produce the fastest planes and the biggest for the military. DiCaprio's Hughes balances ambitious plans well laid out with the creeping advent of uncontrollable mental illness. Closeups show a Hughes who knows something is going rather wrong but he hasn't the ability to fight it (or the shrinks).<br/><br/>As Hughes's lover Ava Gardner, Kate Beckinsale is very grown up and convincing. She's a versatile actress and she proves it again here.<br/><br/>The denouement of Hughes's public life was a vicious scandal engineered by Pan Am's Juan Trippe (a smooth, venal Alec Baldwin) who controlled Maine's Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (a not as nice as we usually expect him to be Alan Alda). Trippe coveted a monopoly for international flights for Pan Am (anyone see a Pan Am plane lately?) and Hughes's TWA was an obstacle that had to be neutralized by law or acquired by coerced sale.<br/><br/>The Senate hearing is over dramatized but it reflects a dirty world of false accusations and behind the scenes chicanery that, I understand, actually occurs from time to time. Shocking.<br/><br/>Perhaps Hughes's greatest gift to mankind was not his into the air briefly only once, eight-engine Spruce Goose, but his getting Jane Russell in ""The Outlaw"" to the screen past the censors. Many male libidos owed much to that film's release. But the men who couldn't bare to have Russell's ample cleavage on big screens held up the movie's release for SIX years. Awful!<br/><br/>Jude Law who is in nearly every movie these days shows up as Errol Flynn. A forgettable performance.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, Blanchett, Beckinsale, Alda and Baldwin make a good team with a master director, Scorsese. Wonder what's next? <br/><br/>Good use is made of period newsreels and the score helps keep the dialog moving nicely.<br/><br/>9/10"

But there is one scene that is simply stunning in The Aviator. The XF-11 sequence is absolutely amazing. It was raw and frightening. Exciting and beautiful to watch. I would give this film a 10 for that sequence alone, It is simply a masterful blend of photography, acting, special and digital effects, and especially editing. I love spectacle in movies and for me, recommending The Aviator on the basis of the XF-11 sequence would be the same as somebody recommending Ben Hur because of the Chariot Race.<br/><br/>The Aviator is an exciting film.

And although I think Martin Scorsese should've gotten his Oscar for another movie than this (so the decision was right not to give him one here imho), I also think he made better movies than Departed. Then again Departed delivered and satisfied more than this!<br/><br/>The acting from Di Caprio is good (much better than in Gangs), although some of the scenes (or better the script) seems to let him down. Even a scene in a cinema hall, really happened (the movie is based on real characters, fyi if you didn't know already), it just didn't translate that well on screen, imho! And the real characters? I do think (and I'm not the only one, as friends of mine have told me), that some actors/actresses have been miscast. The fact that I'm not fully aware of all the H. Hughes stories shouldn't make a difference in my viewing pleasure, but then again they might have made this experience a bit lighter (and heavier at the same time, because of the length) for me ... Not a bad movie/biopic by any mean, but nothing I was excited about afterwards either!"

","This is supposedly about the life of Howard Hughes, a tall thin man who I met a couple of times. There have been better movies made about his life than this. This one is not very accurate and the casting is bad.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't resemble Howard Hughes in the least and never really captures his character. Even worse is Cate Blanchett playing the part of Katherine Hepburn. Hepburn was a rail thin beauty with a special marvelous voice and Blanchett is just the opposite, unattractive, average build, and with nothing special about her. The way she played Hepburn was a travesty, particularly to Hepburn fans. But then the relationship between Hughes and Hepburn was fictional and never really happened as shown in the movies.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Hughes' foibles but for the most part they are overemphasized or taken out of context or even contrived. Hughes' life was a long and complex story which unfortunately is too abbreviated in the movie, such as omitting his marriage to Jean Peters"
"zetes","9","3","8","27 December 2004"," Great work by Scorsese and his cast
","Well directed biopic of Howard Hughes that's probably too ambitious and original to be called a biopic. This is simply the story of Hughes' early, gigantic life where he imagined giant movies, glamorous women, and futuristic airplanes, but was crippled by an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sure, this isn't Scorsese's most personal film, but I never quite thought of him as a straight auteur. A lot of his films do share common themes, but there's always Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, The Age of Innocence, and After Hours. I think of Scorsese first and foremost as a master of the medium, an especially skilled director, and I think The Aviator is one of his greatest directorial triumphs. He is a master of developing the mood of the picture and controlling its pace. It flows beautifully. The film boasts some of the very best acting of the year, too. Leonardo DiCaprio is just coming into his mature period as an actor, and this is his best performance to date. It's definitely Oscar worthy. Cate Blanchett is a marvel playing Katharine Hepburn. At first I wasn't sure if she was just doing a crass imitation, but her character really develops nicely. Cate disappears and we then have Kate. Just try to keep her from carrying home the statuette! Another Kate, Kate Beckinsale, is also very good as Ava Gardener. She's not a great actress, but she holds her own here. Add to them fine supporting performances from John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, and Ian Holm. Also Jude Law, in his fiftieth film appearance of 2004, plays Errol Flynn and is so good that I wanted a lot more. I love films about Golden Age Hollywood, and I like trying to spot the references. One of the best and most entertaining movies of 2004 thus far. 9/10."
"Rutajit","7","3","8","25 December 2004"," Historically inaccurate, cinematic ally very good
","The Aviator is not meant to be a historically accurate representation of Hughes' life and isn't. That being said, it's an excellent film. The acting is top notch and the special effects work very well with the tone and spirit of the movie. Martin Scorcese is at his best in the directorial department. Leonardo's acting is worthy of an Oscar but I believe he will be denied one. This movie is worth watching for Di Caprio's performance alone. Cate Blanchett is a little unbelievable as Katherine Hepburn even though she gives it her all. The pacing was a little up and down as. Not the greatest movie you will see but definitely one of the best of the year. Watch it as a work of fiction and you won't be disappointed. Don't wait for the DVD."

","i originally did not want to go see this movie, but on a cold December (20th) Monday, off we went. at one point in time, i was totally infatuated with Howard Hughes (HH), & read everything i could about his life. so, i assumed the movie would be not only full of distortions, but also ""thought"" Leo was a terrible choice.<br/><br/>1st, the bad news, Scorsese did the requisite surface research, but, just did not seem able to capture the magic of Hughes's essence. the ""rosebud"" theory re: HH's slide into germ madness via his mother's influence was never really explored accurately, just little bits & pieces, haphazardly strung together at different parts of the movie, that come across as a convenient lazy way to attempt to explain Hughes inner depths & subsequent slide. in fact, it was both his mother & relatives who re-inforced his awareness of germ spread, as well as the premature deaths of both his parents, the smothering of his mother, & other personality-forming events from his 1st 18 yrs that may have equally contributed to his later madness. no one really knows. Scorsese's appearance of 1sthand knowledge of HH's relationships, scenes, & conversations with Hepburn & Ava appears to be too much artistic interpretation of HH's Hollywood yrs. Scorsese seems to accept too much of the hearsay as gospel & the relationships come off as affectations of the director, unfortunately. movie biographies are incredibly difficult to bring to the screen, & to bring someone as complicated & larger-than-life as HH's early yrs to the screen is particularly difficult. its too bad, Scorsese is not as attuned as this story demands, but given the amazingly difficult subject matter, he ""sort of"" tells the story within a framework that gets ""close, but only 1/2 a cigar"". <br/><br/>on the positive side, i must ""eat my hat"" & anyone else's who does NOT think that Leo was not an inspired choice! he was perfect! he was sublime! just as i became an early believer in Brad Pitt's terrific acting, i am now a believer in Leo's! he no longer has to prove himself. to say he ""nailed"" HH would be an amazing understatement. it was eerie watching his performance - he WAS HH. from his boyish good looks, just as HH's was, to his appearance before the congressional committee, to taking up the controls of the ""spruce goose"", he actually made you feel as if HH had come back to star in this film. an earlier review could not have been more wrong. anyone who has taken the trouble to read & view photos from these several periods in HH's life would HAVE to agree there is a remarkable similarity. capturing HH's obsession with the aerial scenes in ""hell's angels"", Russell's bra n ""the outlaw"", the aviation speed records, the undertaking of building the largest aircraft ever, the appearance before the congressional committee, the treatment of subordinates, the phobias, the obsession with details was sublime. as i said above, Scorsese does get close. maybe it was just too difficult. <br/><br/>in conclusion, with someone as brilliant, as complicated, as mad, as HH; it is virtually impossible to capture these nuances & transfer to the screen. ""Hollywood"" always errs in translation, then excuses itself for failing by falling back on the tried & true ""entertainment for entertainment's sake"", a la Oliver Stone unfortunate falsehoods wrapped in sincerity. on the other hand, no one should ever go to the movies expecting the truth. so therefore, Hollywood's ultimate contribution is story telling. knowing this, ""the aviator"" could have been made somewhat more interesting, less boring, & certainly shorter. true, it was too long, true, a number of scenes were unnecessarily long, as many in the audience expressed leaving the theatre. however, i did not share that sentiment. why? because, in spite of everything i have said, this was a good ""movie""! i believe Leo nailed the role better than Scorsese's direction, & a long movie was necessary to tell the story. wishing for a more factual rendition is probably too far beyond the talents that believe they have more talent than they actually have. if i had not been so mesmerized by Leo's unbelievable performance, this movie would not have been as entertaining. BUT, due to Leo's performance, the movie does take on life, & makes you believe what you're watching IS the early period of Hughes's life. the theory that the story is always the main feature is mostly a truism; however, every once in a while, an actor comes along that is able to ""lift up"" an endeavor, & we should all be appreciative.<br/><br/>as for HH, on the whole it was a sad life; however, for his 1st 45-47 yrs, he was a truly brilliant American pioneer who captured the public's imagination with his derring-do, warts & all! although the ""warts"" did not surface til later. one can say whatever they want, but his 1st 47 yrs could not have been more exciting or more magnetic."

","Despite other reviews on this website, I found The Aviator to be quite enjoyable. This is definitely a new style for Scorsese, at least it seemed so to me, and I thought he was very successful. DiCaprio's performance is really spot on and I really thought I saw Howard Hughes in all his eccentricities shine through. Cate Blanchett as Ms. O'Hara gave an incredible performance as well (surprise, surprise). She's quite stunning as the famous actress and explodes off the screen. Throughout the film we really get an inside look into the life, lunacy, and megalomania that is Howard Hughes, and I found Scorsese to be very successful. Two thumbs up."

","Awesome in spirit, of snapshots of the lives of Howard Hughes, Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow. Beautiful. Brilliant. Riveting. 12/10. Hughes' personality tics were addressed, down to the long fingernails and germ fears. Yuck. Beautifully essayed by Mr. Di Caprio. Apparently the mental illness began quite early in Mr. Hughes' life, but I noticed that when Hughes was flying his planes he was totally professional and on top of things. I actually liked the 3 hour length of this movie, and feel that it took that long to tell the story of a very complicated and caring man. I loved the part where Howard annihilates the senator in the courtroom. I was rooting for Howard to beat him at the hearings, and I was not disappointed. ""Ol' sick Howard"" really gave him what-for. Howard invented the word ""guts"", and I feel that Leonardo Di Caprio did an excellent job. Kudos to the actor. Hughes was a great aviation pioneer. Again, 12/10."
"FreddyShoop","10","3","9","26 December 2004"," Surprisingly Entertaining
","Well color me surprised. Scorcese does wonders with this film. It is very good, but not great. The cinematography and direction of this movie is inspired. Scorcese throws in plenty of interesting camera work, and his directing considers every period detail. Perhaps the only thing that I found odd about this period piece (1930s - 1940s) is that it never really deals with WWII. The characters are so insulated that WWII only surfaces in relation to airplane deals and congressional expenditures.<br/><br/>In any event, this movie is thoroughly entertaining despite its almost 3 hr running time. Hughes' life provides plenty of interesting material for movie, even if the movie doesn't take us to the sordid ending of Hughes life.<br/><br/>DiCaprio does an excellent job as Hughes. He is very believable as Hughes at all levels of his life. I was pleasantly surprised by his performance, as I am not a fan of his (didn't like Titanic and thought his performance in Gangs of New York was weak by comparison to Daniel Day Lewis). His efforts to portray Hughes' genius, eccentricity, and ultimately his mental illness were seamless and believable.<br/><br/>Blanchett as Hepburn was great. She plays her over the top, full of life, and very interesting. Whenever she was on the screen the movie just hummed along.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the next best actor was Alan Alda as a corrupt Senator. What a wonderful effort being cast against his sensitive nice guy image.<br/><br/>While the movie doesn't have a real emotional or philosophical center to it, it is still entertaining as hell. Perhaps the lack of center isn't so much a defect as a realistic view that most lives do not neatly convey a philosophical message or unfold in a clear cut manner (despite the fact that Hollywood tries to give biopics some philosophical theme or message). Whether it is the draw of fantastic wealth, the gambler's spirit, the womanizing with Hollywood's most attractive starlets, or the inventive entrepreneurial spirit, the Aviator is entertaining from start to finish."
"schappe1","Null","3","9","25 December 2004"," A Life is Not a Movie
","Some people are grousing that this film departs from history in certain ways, such as by exaggerating the depth and length of Howard Hughes' relationship with Katherine Hepburn. A life is not a movie. It's a jumble of various events in lives that collide together in an almost random fashion. To make a film you have to assemble those events into a cogent story. That's going to mean telescoping time, creating composite characters and fictional scenes that have at least an element of truth and move the story along. Martin Scorsese, as usual, has done that brilliantly. A nearly three hour film flies by without ever becoming boring.<br/><br/>It does, however become depressing. This is the story of a genius, (an egotistical, overbearing one but nonetheless a genius) who becomes undone by mental illness. Despite being the protagonist, Hughes is never really a sympathetic character. He's tragic but there's no attempt made to get the audience to like him. And the scenes of his mental entropy are painful but not at all touching. I did wonder how they were going to end this thing and the combination of success- the flight of the ""spruce goose""- with another attack while Hughes mumbles about the future is excellent. Achievements were in his past, not his future.<br/><br/>DeCaprio forever banishes any idea that he was just the latest pretty boy. I never imagined that he could play Howard Hughes but he becomes Howard Hughes. If anything, he's more convincing in the final scenes when Hughes was much older that DeCaprio than in the early ones when he was close to Leonardo's present age. Leonardo DeCaprio is a legitimately. The Oscar will be between him and another performer who ""became"" his character- Jaime Foxx. They were both great.<br/><br/>As to the other performers, Cate Blanchett does about as well as you can trying to play the great Kate Hepburn, (this film is awash in Kates- or Cates). Kate Beckinsale is fine as Ava Gardner, who shows up before she should have. Why they spent the money to get Jude Law to play Errol Flynn, I don't know. He's just window dressing. Perhaps he had some scenes that wound up on the cutting room floor. Alec Baldwin is adequate as Hughes' rival, Juan Trippe, who created Pam Am Airlines. Alan Alda does a good job with another one of his ""cast against type"" roles as a corrupt Senator.<br/><br/>It's an impressive but not really enjoyable film that still may good enough to win a lot of awards, including Scorsese's elusive first Oscar. If the Red Sox can do it."
"morphricky","3","2","5","1 July 2012"," Pretty to look at, but oh so boring.
","The only thing that kept me interested was watching the scenery, hairstyles and clothing in the era. It was also interesting to see the coconut grove as I've watched a documentary before about the fire there.<br/><br/>But besides that, this movie feels very empty. Howard Hughes, who I never read about before, comes off as a maniac. The movie focuses so much on the OCD that it forgets to give him a defining character. Despite needing millions of dollars for projects, money just seems to magically appear if he wants to, never do we see how he actually gets the money. <br/><br/>All the characters felt empty as well. One scene that really bugged me is when Katherine returns home and tells him she has fallen in love with someone else. This development is so fast it feels forced. One scene they are going to be married, the next scene they have an argument, the next scene she talks briefly to another man and the next scene she comes home saying she is in love and is going to move. And this is in a span of five minutes! It makes it seem that one argument is enough to doom the relationship, which makes the character Katherine appear immature. Besides that, I couldn't really connect with any of the characters. They felt so devoid of emotion that I barely kept track of who was who.<br/><br/>At the two hour mark, I had to stop the movie and do something else, because it was just so boring. Unfortunately the last part of the movie didn't have much to offer so I left the movie running while doing something else, briefly watching it until the end."

I know you're thinking this has nothing to do with the film, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good analogy. I did like the bit where he was stuck in his little screening room for a long time though, it was weird that he was drinking urine and peeing milk though.

","I know many people say this following the viewing of a terrible film, but I can honestly say that this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. It would be pointless to go into the entire story of how I saw the film, the only important information is I viewed the film in theaters when it was released. <br/><br/>There has always been an incredible amount of hype about this film which obviously remains as indicated by the over 8 rating here on IMDb. So as to be expected, there were pretty serious expectations leading to the viewing of the film. Needless to say, these expectations were not even close to being met. While viewing the film, I waited and waited for the movie to have something eventful occur. Howard Hughes has an incredibly interesting life, yet even some of the most interesting and exciting events that occurred in this man's life were made so anti-climactic that made the entire movie very disappointing. When you walk out a theater being one of five people shaking your heads why you refused to leave a movie simply out of principal and the hope that the film would actually get better at some point, then that is when it occurs to you that this movie was in fact that terrible. <br/><br/>I feel bad writing about a movie that I think is the worst I've ever seen, but all I can hope is someone interested in this film reads this review and chooses literally anything else to watch. And I of course only have one question for those who actually liked/love this film: You sure you were watching the film where Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes? Seriously, just do your self a favor, spend 170 minutes of your life doing something more enjoyable than a mouthful of aluminum foil."
"billion_mucks","7","2","5","4 November 2007"," Dedicated and Colourful, didn't move me an inch
","Scorcese was, until the creation of ""The Departed"", the black sheep of the Oscars. In ""The Aviator"", Scorcese delivers an outstanding carnival of eccentric clothings, fresh visual tones, and sly filmography scenes. Seeing the movie, one utterly is deviated into the majestic scenario of powerful dresses, settings, decorations that the focus on Howard Hughes is sometimes lost. Di Caprio applies fabulously to his work, so does Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda. There is a gigantic cast; which will fascinate you with the presence of stars. The luxury and excess of the movie is the contrast that sharpens the grey and unmoving story of Hughes. We like his story, we understand his fall but it doesn't emotionally move us. Scorcese has derogated into a path of visual content and left aside unpolished the strength of what meant to be a great biopic."

","Minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I will start with the only ray of light in this picture - Cate Blanchett. Her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn was simply immaculate, providing the so much needed depth and insight to this movie. <br/><br/>The rest is darkness. The Aviator is storytelling at it's worst. Covering 20 years of Howard Hughes' life the movie is actually more of a biographic encyclopedia entry rather than anything else. We simply follow the main character from one point in time to another (""Two years later..."", ""One hour later...""), from one project to another, as the movie lists his accomplishments and sometimes mentions his failures. The overall impression is that of a series of publicity shots, arranged to portray one of the most controversial figures in American history as the perfect American, living ""The Great American Dream"". The only fault that Howard Hughes appears to have is his compulsive behaviour disorder, and even that is attributed to his mother's dominating and apparently sick parenthood.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly long, and yet three hours later we still don't know who Howard Hughes really was and what drove him (besides his love for airplanes of cause). We learn in the most ""matter of fact"" manner that 3 pilots were killed during the shooting of ""Hell's Angels"", but we never get to see how Hughes dealt with this fact on any level, personal or organizational. We see and hear of scores of women who entered his life and left a bit later, but they are just passing names to us. We see him hire an underage girl for ""private services"" but do not know why he did it. The list can go on forever.<br/><br/>Everything is made as simple as possible. Pan Am - bad, TWA - good. Mother - bad, Howard Hughes - good. Even the physical appearance of the main characters doesn't change - even though 20 years pass within the storyline, they all still look the same, including the hairstyles. Such a simplified portrayal of Howard Hughes and his times is an insult not only to the man himself, but to the viewer.<br/><br/>So shallow was the movie, that even though we are introduced to Hughes' character in 1927 and leave him around 1947, the Second World War is not mentioned till approximately 1946, with the tiny exception of the Hercules project specifications. And just as the shallow and self-obsessed Hollywood, portrayed by Scorsese, failed to notice the war, so did Scorsese's picture. <br/><br/>If you feel like watching a three hour long issue of E!-channel retro issue of a celebrity watch program - this one is for you. If you don't - just read the ""Hughes, Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (1905-1976)"" entry in your encyclopedia.<br/><br/>5 out of ten just for the breath of fresh air called Cate Blanchett."

"aeo","6","2","5","9 January 2005"," Good but not great.
","I give this 6 star out of 10.<br/><br/>I would have given this 7 stars but the ending was not well done. I have to admit, I liked this movie although I did not want to since I cannot stand Di Caprio. That being said, he performed the part of Howard Hughes very well.<br/><br/>The movie focused on parts of Howard Hughes life I did not know about. Howard Hughes was a rich man who inherited a fortune from his parents' business of making machinery tools. He, however, was not interested in the tool business and came to Hollywood to make movies. While making movies, he became interested in aviation as a result of making the movie Hell Cats. He created the now-defunct airline TWA. He became embroiled in personal battle with Juan Trippe, who was the head of Pan Am Airways. The film also showed how Trippe used his influence with public officials to stop TWA from expanding its business into Pan Am territories. In between all these projects and battles, he had time to date many women including starlets.<br/><br/>I knew these facts, that I mentioned above, from seeing a documentary about him a while back but I did not know the intimate details of the relationship of some of these women he had relationship with and how his battle with Juan Trippe nearly drove him over the edge. Speaking of over the edge, I had no idea Howard Hughes had a huge OCD problem or obsessive compulsive behavior problem. This movie showed how this behavior became a constant thorn in his side.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but I really liked this movie and this is in spite of Di Caprio and also Alec Baldwin. Now the reason why I gave this a 6 rather than 7 or above is that the movie does not go further than early 1950's of his life. I want to know more. I think a good biography of a person should show his beginning and also the end. Maybe the creators of this movie did not want to make a long movie but it leaves movie goers with only a half view of his life.<br/><br/>Another thing I had problem with is the choice of actress to portray Ava Gardner. Ava Gardner was truly a stunning woman and the actress who portrayed her was pretty but does not come close to being on par with Gardner. With all the beautiful girls out there who are trying to make it into show business, couldn't the movie makers pick more beautiful actress to portray Gardner?"

He was exceptional with the psychotic episodes, from his youth to later in life. My husband and I truly enjoyed the film, which doesn't happen often enough! The only change I would suggest is to edit out a couple of minutes near the end-it started to get drawn out-but then it was over anyway. His personal life was fascinating, also loved the part when he faced the senate committee and turned it around to them-that was great part! The flight scenes took your breath away, felt like you were flying too. And the crash in Hollywood, felt like you were there when it happened. I had no idea he had been through something like that-no wonder he had so many health problems."

I don't know what it is...I like the actors and enjoy watching a few parts,(like Hepburn scenes), but I could care less about the story and never become involved in it. Besides they left out so much and never really showed what a seedy character and womanizer he was. When I first heard they made this movie I wondered why anyone would want to watch a story about a nutcase billionaire and his escapades. I mean like, I hate movies where I already know the ending. So I guess I was prejudiced from the start. Hughes was brilliant in many ways , but he was also a self indulgent bore who racist and paranoid of communism and ruined a good many people's lives in Hollywood because of it. I hate the way Hollywood romanticizes these real life characters and makes them something they are not. I also don't see where Decaprio did such an ""awesome"" job. He was too young for one thing."

For three hours, he was no longer Leo but was Howard Hughes himself. A definite contender for an Oscar. The supporting cast complemented Leo's work in bringing out the the complexities of a genius on the verge of madness. The Kates, Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale touched the softer side of Hughes' personal life. While John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda defined his business savvy.

Leonardo Di Caprio, Hollywood's Golden Boy, is the perfect choice here and does an excellent job in showing how a focused young man became a laser-eyed optimist even if it meant the brink of bankruptcy. <br/><br/>Among his sexual conquests were a bevy of Hollywood starlets including Katharine Hepburn (smartly played by Blanchett eschewing the possibilities of rank caricature) who he courted for some time and previously with the starlet Jean Harlow (a vague Stefani making her screen debut) and subsequently with Ava Gardner (Beckinsale providing enough grit and heart equally) who was not for sale as she makes abundantly clear.<br/><br/>His attempts at film-making were as brash as his business dealings with his first film ""Hell's Angels"" which took up to nearly three years at approx. a million per and his run in with PanAm honcho Juan Trippe (a subdued yet oily Baldwin) as he attempted to start his fledgling company TWA for international jet setting and commercial aviation as well as the aforementioned witch hunt led by Senator Brewester (a truly conniving weasely Alda). <br/><br/>Clearly Hughes was a visionary and a master of his own foresight as well as a cantankerous perfectionist with his share of setbacks including an incredibly scarily realized maiden test flight with a plane that crashed in Beverly Hills nearly killing him. On top of that came his slow deterioration into mental illness, which the film touches base with in getting an inkling of the tragedy to come. Scorsese deftly depicts this in short bursts with DiCaprio repeating himself ad nauseum while conversing and so germ phobic at one point he has to wait in a men's room until the door is opened from the other side. <br/><br/>The film excels in its sleek, retro production design by Dante Ferretti, gorgeous cinematography by Robert Richardson and snappy score by Howard Shore keeps the pacing of Scorsese's editing collaborator vet Thelma Schoonmaker at a decent pace in its nearly three hour run; my only gripe is it would've been best if they finished what they started in by showing the last chapter of his extraordinary man.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a truly gifted artist and expresses obsession like no one since Hitchcock and to show how one man's mania for flying high  literally and metaphorically  may in fact land him his first Oscar. It's long overdue."

","I really wish there was an option for zero stars because this garbage is that bad. It is so boring that at the end of the film you have to check your pulse to make sure you have not died of boredom. How the budget for this film was so high is beyond me since two hours of it takes place in a single room with barely any dialogue. The movie drags, drags, drags, and just when you think there is light at the end of the tunnel and that it is over it drags on long. It is almost three hours of absolutely painful torture. This is hands down the absolute worst film I have ever seen. The film is about Howard Hughs and his OCD, but even as someone with OCD myself I still could not appreciate any of this. (And his case was portrayed to be very extreme by the way.) There was absolutely no reason for this movie to drag on for three hours it could have been wrapped up in an hour and a half. It drags on since it is supposed to be a ""masterpiece"" but it is horrible. Hands down this is one of the absolute worst and torturous movies I have ever had to sit through. Terrible"

","My wife and I looked forward to watching this and we were both disappointed, it was a struggle to hang on to the end. Some outstanding acting by the leads wasn't enough to rescue this movie from a very average screenplay in our opinion. The hype surrounding this movie earned it a awful vote from us. Its a shame, Howard Hughes story deserved much better treatment than this. Perhaps the great failing of the screenplay was its attempt to deliver the whole story without ever getting each of the sub-plots off the ground (excuse the pun). It over-does the phobia stuff, under-does the aviation history and struggles to deliver the love interest in context."

","Okay, so ""Million Dollar Baby"" was great, but I still say that ""The Aviator"" should have won Best Picture (especially since Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar). The story of Howard Hughes' (Leonardo DiCaprio) Hollywood years, the movie shows his determination to make ""Hell's Angels"" at any cost, his love affair with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), his persecution by PanAm CEO Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) and Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), and finally his experience with the Spruce Goose. And we can clearly see how Hughes was getting germ-phobic during these years.<br/><br/>Among other things, it's good to see DiCaprio breaking away from the ""Titanic"" mold. Further kudos to him for taking on a role as great as this one. ""The Aviator"" isn't one of those epics that prides itself only on visuals while lacking any real plot; it's all about the story (but then again, Martin Scorsese's movies always have real plots). Like ""Gangs of New York"", it looks at something that so many people probably wouldn't usually think of.<br/><br/>All in all, kudos to everyone who participated in this movie. Like I said, it deserved Best Picture. Oh well, at least it took home more Oscars than ""Million Dollar Baby""."

","Everything about this film is fantastic-the writing, the cinematography, the music, the direction but above all the acting - even the cameos (Jude Law, William Defoe etc.) are used to the utmost without taking away anything from the flow of the story. Leonardo Di Caprio MUST win every acting award going for his portrayal of Hughes - he appears in, and dominates, every single scene. This film deserves to win both Best Film and Best Director Oscars (but then again when did that ever happen 2 years in a row?) The only slight niggle I have is a few continuity errors (particularly in the scene where Hughes sets the world air-speed record where the cockpit cover appears and disappears between shots).<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film highly enough - you owe it to yourself to see it and to urge all your friends to go also"
"rondine","10","2","6","5 January 2005"," I LOVED it, beginning to end......
","This was an unforgettable movie. It was full of fun, eccentricity, sadness, love, laughter, and mystery. For me, I was thinking of this movie long after I left the theater- a sign for me that it was great.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with another review of the years this movie covered or the production values. I would like to review the way the movie portrayed its subject since so many people have themselves commented on that. Mr. Howard Hughes, like so many of us, is an ""unanswered question."" There is no definitive way to explain the profound complexities of anyone, especially a complicated man like him. The beginning of the story with his mother washing him, telling him that he was not safe- isn't meant to totally explain or blame anything or anyone. It's just a bit of insight into an otherwise inscrutable man. That's part of why people are still interested in him- the mystery of life and in this case, his life. (And to another reviewer who naïvely thinks that his mother didn't have an effect on his neurosis, I point to them that the majority of mental illness isn't organic in nature, but learned.)<br/><br/>Also I was sadly dismayed to see some people's reaction to his mental illness as ""creepy"" and ""disturbing."" What ever happened to the saying, ""There but for the grace of God go I."" Empathy is always a good way to begin to understand people. Perhaps the reason some people didn't get this movie is a lack of both understanding & empathy. I may not care how the peas are arranged on my plate, but I guarantee you, I don't want someone else touching my food and they may draw back a nub if they try it! The opera singer Shirley Verrett supposedly never shakes hands when she meets people- being a singer, she doesn't want to catch a cold. If you look at it from that point of view, she's just being cautious, not eccentric. (By the way, I only heard this as a rumor, I am not putting it out there as fact.) My point isn't that these are examples of the same or even similar things. I'm just saying that it's easier to understand someone if you try a little to, as Atticus Finch said, ""walk around in their shoes a bit."" <br/><br/>And what about the genius of the man? Here is a man with very little formal education who was SMART. He was smart not just in a worldly way, but an obviously talented aviator & designer. He was able to envision the future. He didn't just finance the future, but had the courage to fail. The courage to try what other people said couldn't be done. It may be true it's easier to try when your last penny isn't in danger, but as the movie shows, he DID go to considerable financial lengths to finance some of his projects. He was a dichotomy: on one hand the fearless businessman & aviator and on the other, a terrified human being just trying to get through life. <br/><br/>Lastly, I thought all the performances were wonderful. Especially DiCaprio. And why is anyone that knows any of his work surprised? I enjoyed him tremendously in ""This Boy's Life,"" ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" and ""Catch Me if You Can."" I was totally immersed in his character in each of these movies. And his passion on screen for his art and the people he becomes is compelling and sincere. Cate Blanchett was more than just imitation as well. Despite playing an even more famous on-screen presence than HH, she isn't just imitating Kate Hepburn, she is being her for us on screen. All the rest of the cast did very well too. I enjoyed Alan Alda's annoyingly smug senator Brewster. Not since ""And the Band Played On"" have I enjoyed disliking him on screen so much.<br/><br/>Well, I hope to have given insight into why this is a movie worth watching. No movie could ever truly encompass a man's life or explain his proclivities- but this movie attempts to show some of the depths of depression and the heights of his happiness. I know I will see it again and look forward to owning it myself on DVD. Thank you to both Mr. Scorsese and Mr. DiCaprio for bringing this moving mystery of a man to the screen."

","Leo blew me away in this movie. He definitely gives the best performance of his career. He is so good as Howard Hughes: the courtroom scene, all the scenes with him on the airplane and being the director. His accent and expressions are all great, and he portrayed the disease very well. It's certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination and possibly even the win.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also great. Cate Blanchett performed Kate Hepturn beautifully. It's a very showy supporting role, and her first interaction with Leo on the golf course cries Oscar, while her last scene with Leo through the door showed her range. I like Baldwin a lot in this movie, and Alda played the senator very efficiently.<br/><br/>The production value and visual effects are also grand. The only minor complaint I have is that it was a little long in the middle and seems to lose its focus for a while before getting it back at the congressional hearing. 9 out of 10."

","30 December 2004. Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn stands out as one of the best performances of all time - her acting and capture of the one of the greatest actresses is a tribute to both Hepburn and Blanchett - a strong contender for best actress. The Aviator also captures one of the most frightening and dramatic crash scenes (the literally bursts even further from the trailers). This intense and psychological and physically revealing movie is raw and hard-hitting. Leonardo offers up a spectacular breakthrough performance, maturing as an actor and taking on the more difficult job of method acting (having to become another person) and shed his own persona and his past historical performance from Titanic. Interestly, this movie isn't perfect in that unfortunately, this movie is only half a movie and is unable to offer its audience with the Godfather I and II effect that would make the movie experience complete."

","This direction by Martin Scorsese is epic in vistas. Glorious soundtrack by Howard Shore. Great supporting role by Cate Blanchett. Really impressive epic psychological portrait of billionaire Howard Hughes who is tormented by mental disorders and struggles to stay sane.<br/><br/>It's 1945, and 2 aviation companies fight each other for control of the American skies. One aviation company is a new comer and headed by Leonardo di Caprio. Will he succeed in becoming a succes? Or will the powers that be cripple Leonardo di Caprio's attempt of becoming the biggest aviation company in history?<br/><br/>This is a story about how to achieve the American Dream at all costs. True story by the way, based on billionaire Howard Hughes. Just google that name, quite extra oridinary story. What makes this epic story unique is the portrayal of all the psychological fears that plague Leonardo di Caprio while he is trying to achieve succes as a newcomer in the aviaton business.<br/><br/>In his role as a CEO of a huge aviation company, Leonardo di Caprio has got OCD (Obsessive Compulsion Disorder), a mental disorder in which fears are entirely controlled by obsessive repeated thought and behaviour patterns. To put it more simply, the man has got excruciating fears of being touched or touching anything which he fears isnt clean. These obsessive fears cripple di Caprio while he is simultaneously trying to achieve to become the biggest aviation company of the world.

","Continuing the run of Biopics that dominated the 2005 Oscars, ""The Aviator"" tells the life story of Howard Hughes from film producer, to Hollywood playboy, to aviator entrepreneur, to recluse.<br/><br/>Given the many and various things that Howard Hughes attempted in his life, the movie feels to me like it's skimming over his story somewhat. I think it would have been better suited to take a deeper dive on one or two key aspects, rather than trying to cover it all. It makes some of it feel a bit disjointed, for example, Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) comes and goes from his life without much explanation of how they connected, or reconnected following a violent breakup. There's little information provided about how things really turned out, his film for example, ""Hell's Angels"" is given a sceptical standing ovation at the Premier, but we're never provided any information on how the film turned out.<br/><br/>Whilst I'm stuck on the negatives (and I know I'm criticising a legend here) I don't think some of the choices for shots are great. There are occasional hyper kinetic pan shots that I had to look away from to stop from feeling queasy. There are also some horrible overlays in establishing shots of locations and occasionally the effects haven't held up very well (although that's not the case in every scene).<br/><br/>Which is not the say that the film is terrible, or bad even. Performances are great, across the board. It's a very mannered performance but Cate Blanchett is worthy of her best supporting Oscar for her performance as Katherine Hepburn. John C Reilly and Matt Ross are also good. There are a myriad of little performances, sometimes only in one scene, from the likes of Jude Law, Willem Defoe and Danny Huston that add to the quality of the production. But it's Leonardo DiCaprio's film. He's in virtually every scene and his performance was definitely good value for the nomination, though I'd agree it's not better than Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"".<br/><br/>Never dull despite its running time, ""The Aviator"" is tremendous from a performance viewpoint, though a little shallow, making it solid but not essential."

","Can the outsized ambition of one of Hollywood's biggest legends smash Hollywood convention and make a picture for the ages? How about two legends, then? Star Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese give it a ride, anyway.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes inherited a lot of money and a fear of germs. Enjoying the first before the second tears him apart, he sets about making a movie that runs up seven-figure bills in 1927, then scraps it and remakes it for sound. ""Hell's Angels"" turns out quite a hit, but Hughes has already moved on to other passions, building experimental planes and bedding Hollywood starlets. Sure it sounds like fun, but can he survive the crash landings?<br/><br/>One of his lovers, Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), puts it this way: ""There's too much Howard Hughes in Howard Hughes. That's the trouble.""<br/><br/>That's the trouble with ""The Aviator,"" too. Taking a 20-year wedge of Hughes' life that incorporated everything from round-the-world flights to building a transcontinental airline, the movie struggles for a focus. In a five-minute span, we see Hughes design a monoplane, take Jean Harlow to a film premiere, and found a future mega-business, Hughes Aircraft. Scorsese is in a hurry to dazzle you with overlit sequences and fuzzy CGI.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's ascension to the ranks of Hollywood's elite seems to have been the true focus of this film. He's fine, too, shedding his youthful image with an eerie approximation of Hughes' Texas drawl that is equal parts authority and anxiety. I just felt there were times when too much of the director's attention was on having Leo do an acting clinic and show the Oscar people something. He's best here working off other people, namely Alan Alda as a nasty senator named Brewster set on bringing Hughes down.<br/><br/>Alda was nominated for an Oscar; Blanchett won one, either her first or Hepburn's fifth. It's a clenched, tinny performance, i. e. true to life and hard to take for more than a few minutes at a time. Fortunately, Kate/Cate makes an early exit, albeit not soon enough for me. What was the point of her character, anyway? If she's supposed to represent Hughes' truest object of desire, she doesn't have the air-speed velocity.<br/><br/>The film does improve as it goes on, reversing the Hughes experience in life. The climax is a hearing held by Brewster in which both Alda and DiCaprio show how good this film might have been had it cut out the starlets and the flying montages and just gotten to the part where Hughes takes on the country and Pan-American Airways while his growing mental issues gnaw away at him. Watching Brewster switch from wolf to sheep as Hughes finds his footing is a joy.<br/><br/>Even in this section, though, Scorsese spends long minutes on DiCaprio raging and writhing alone in the nude in order to let us know he's really suffering, not trusting his actor to show us the same thing in numerous small moments where the story is being advanced as well. <br/><br/>The film is never boring, just muddled and straining at a significance it doesn't reach. Like one of Hughes' most famous creations, the giant airplane nicknamed the ""Spruce Goose"" which ""The Aviator"" climaxes with, what you have here is an overloaded creation that struggles to get in the air, and doesn't stay up long."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","2","21 December 2014"," This film puts the cheese in cheesecake
","Martin Scorsese's 2004 feature ""The Aviator"" features once again Leonardo DiCaprio as the actor playing the main character. It happened before, it happened afterward and it will probably happen in the future again as well. The only other film between these the two I considered as great as ""The Aviator"" is ""Shutter Island"". It's a close call. I don't know how historically accurate the ""quarantine"" spelling reference was looking at Hughes and it felt strange initially as it seemed such a random moment from his childhood, but made lots of sense as the film went on. Apart from seeing this to find out about Howard Hughes, it is also a great film to learn about the history of movies. There are so many references included here and it shows Scorsese is a true film nut, just like he proved it again some years later with ""Hugo"". Anyway, you will learn a lot here about Hughes who has led quite the life. He is a Casanova, a pilot, a filmmaker and a lot more. You will learn that Hell's Angels does not only stand for a biker gang and you will see how the smart use of light and shadow can really have an impact on a film. When we see the flash of the camera on the heavily injured Hawkes after the crash (the crash itself and the fight for survival in the plane were maybe the most intense part of the film), we can almost feel his pain. Also note how Hughes wears a moustache after the crash and seems generally more grown-up and adult from there on. Being so close to death was clearly a crucial event in his life that changed almost everything. His fascination almost killed him and his insanity became also more severe because of that development.<br/><br/>The dinner scene with Errol Flynn is not only another great cinematic reference, but also describes Hughes perfectly in just a single scene. He hates media attention and ceremonies, but he loves his job and is 100% dedicated to it. I like J.C. MacKenzie from ""Dark Angel"", so it was nice to see him here, even if it was only a single scene. And then there is Katharine Hepburn of course, played by Cate Blanchett, who won her first Oscar for this portrayal. Maybe it was because of the core of her performance being an actress even when she is one in real life and never managing to be truly authentic, even towards the ones she loves. She is different just like Hawkes, but still they cannot make it work. I really liked the first flight they went on together, which was obviously a date. But it was not really about romance up there, just about having a cool time together and that also felt so different about the two. Hepburn was no woman who wanted to be courted. She wants to have a great time (even if that was in a way not exactly appropriate for a classy Hollywood actress at that time) and that was how she really connected with somebody. There was one interesting quote about how she will be the one to guide his plane when he can't, so fittingly he almost dies in an airplane crash soon after the two broke up. Other girlfriends were played by Kate Beckinsale, Gwen Stefani and Kelli Garner (who fittingly starred in the TV series PanAm a couple years later). Scorsese has a very unique humor and there is some of it in here. He can even turn obscene scenes and quotes about mammaries and boob buffets into cinematic art. Maybe the reason why ""The Aviator"" lost ""Best Picture"" that year was that it did not have the emotional impact of ""Million Dollar Baby"". In terms of craft, it is certainly not inferior. Maybe that is why it won the most Oscars that night. I certainly think it is a better film than ""The Departed"" which finally gave Scorsese his big moment with the Academy. Also it is a great film to watch if you are interested in the history of aviation and airplane development and like to see some great recordings from plane stunts in the air.<br/><br/>DiCaprio gives a very fine performance, maybe the best of his career as a paranoid man obsessed with cleanliness (the doorknob scene at the toilet was great), who slowly slides more and more into insanity and believes evil forces are everywhere. There is some nice music included in the movie too, from the era when it plays. ""I'll Be Seeing You"" is a classic. And then there is also Alec Baldwin, a solid performance that is, however, quite similar to what he has played in the past and also later on ""30 Rock"". Alan Alda plays a senator who cooperates with Baldwin's character and opposes Hughes strongly. The relationship between the two is very interesting and Alda was rewarded with a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for spicing up the last hour of the film. It's all about the public hearing and the future of Hughes and his enterprise. The hearing was a blast. DiCaprio really shone here and it was just a delight to watch, also because it was so unexpected. Pay attention to how all the flashing camera lights were on Alda instead of DiCaprio. If there was any criticism, maybe it is that I don't think Juan would have come to talk Hughes out of it before the hearings began. If that really happened, ignore that criticism of mine. Probably quite a bit in this film was changed for dramatic purpose, but I have no problem with that at all. The final result are three excellent hours of moviemaking with sublime acting that deserved all the recognition it received. Very much recommended. Yes it is three hours long, but it never dragged a bit."

","Say what you want about the old studio biopics that often turn up on cable channels. They were too often schmaltzy, shameless, and as historically accurate as a politician's memory. But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting. On the other hand, The Aviator replaces story line with jumbled imagery, dialogue with rapid-fire editing, and a heavy-weight subject with a light-weight actor who gets serious by scowling and stamping his foot as any 12-year old might. Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does. The moral is that no amount of fiddling with period detail or special effects can make up for a chaotic core. Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for lending your good name to this cinematic mess."

The way he lives as Hughes in this biopic is beyond anyone's skill or repertoire. And his interpretation of OCD, coupled with startling agony is one of the many genius antics he does and amuses in this film. With a beaming supporting cast and very-well written plot, the film advances good in the first hour. Then as the camera focuses on the personality & his disorders & thoughts, the screenplay quite makes it boring at two or three nodes. And although it has nothing to do with the 170 minute run-time, the dullness is the only bad thing about it.<br/><br/>With complementing music and apt direction for such a biopic, Martin Scorsese proves that he is one of the phenomenal directors of all time.

He's one of those actors whose films you can depend on to at least be interesting in some way. As Howard Hughes, you watch a man who has everything (looks, money, intelligence, creativity) but will lose it all to mental illness. I love how clear it is that Howard knows he is not normal, but is powerless to control himself. I can't think of another movie or television show that portrays OCD with as much respect.<br/><br/>While Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Howard, the person who really shines in this film is Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance. The film portrays Hepburn as the only woman who could bring out the tender side of Howard and the only person who could get him to relax enough to have some fun.

","The biographical movie is these days more able than ever to be frank about all kinds of madness and sordidness. In fact it's more than that. It's practically a prerequisite of the modern biopic that you present your subject as some kind of flawed genius. The trouble is, no matter how interesting the individual, an interesting movie is not a guarantee.<br/><br/>The Aviator is directed by Martin Scorsese, whose love of antique cinema surely gave him some special interest in the project. However, I don't see what the idea was of making the early scenes mimic Howard Hughes's two-strip colour process. It doesn't have the authenticity to hark back to the real thing, no other lost classic techniques are resurrected to keep it company, and frankly it looks ugly. As usual Scorsese's showy, jumpy manner of filmmaking is a bit hit-and-miss. He's still great at capturing states of mind, albeit a bit heavy-handedly, but he is seriously short on ""wow"" moments these days.<br/><br/>The protagonist is portrayed by Scorcese's new favourite Leonardo DiCaprio. He's perfect as the young Hughes because he'll probably go on looking eighteen until he's fifty. Trouble is he still looks (and sounds) eighteen when he's playing the middle-aged Hughes. The acting however is first class, subtle yet forceful. The same unfortunately cannot be said of Cate Blanchett's terrible impersonation of Katherine Hepburn, which copies a few of Hepburn's speech patterns in a grotesque caricature. And she gets the accent wrong. No-one else really stands out as good or bad.<br/><br/>In spite of the general mediocrity of the production, Hughes's life as presented here does offer up some great moments. A nice little montage of clips from Hell's Angels which makes it look even better than it probably is in reality. The occasional humour in an incredibly rich man who thinks he can get anything to happen by simply buying the experts. Our ability to actually route for Hughes when he comes back blazing and cleans up at the hearing after everyone had written him off as a nutter. The eventual poignancy as his condition resurfaces. However it's The Aviator's failure to weave this into some kind of grand narrative that makes it seem so plain overall."
"Desertman84","9","1","2","10 January 2012"," All About Howard Hughes
","Martin Scorsese directed this fast-moving, epic-scale biopic documenting the life and loves one of the most colorful Americans of the 20th century, Howard Hughes.The Aviator is a biographical drama film directed by Scorsese, written by John Logan, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio together with together with Cate Blanchett,Alan Alda,Alec Baldwin,Kate Beckinsale,John C. Reilly,Gwen Stefani and Jude Law. It is the story of aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, drawn largely upon numerous sources including a biography by Charles Higham.The film centers on Hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, during which time he became a successful film producer and an aviation magnate while simultaneously growing more unstable due to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. <br/><br/>The Aviator follows Hughes as the twenty-something millionaire, having already made a fortune improving the design of oil-drilling bits, comes to Hollywood with an interest in getting into the picture business. It doesn't take long for Hughes, with his passion for airplanes, to jump from producer to director of his first major film project, a World War I air epic called Hell's Angels, which took three years to complete thanks to the shift from silent to sound filming and Hughes' relentless perfectionism. However, the film was a massive hit, and the eccentric inventor became a mogul in Hollywood, making Jean Harlow a star and enjoying a romance with Katharine Hepburn. But Hollywood's old-boy network never fully accepted Hughes, and in time his passion for flying began to reclaim his attentions as he began designing new planes, setting air speed records, flying around the world, and risking his life testing aircraft. Hughes also found time to romance Ava Gardner and founded his own airline, Trans-World Airlines, though as his ideas became bolder, his approach became more eccentric, and he gained many powerful enemies, including the head of Pan-American Airlines, Juan Trippe, and Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, who attempted to prove that Hughes' radical design ideas were actually part of an effort to bilk taxpayers for millions of dollars through government contracts. <br/><br/>The movie is all rather sprawling and a bit disjointed, but Scorsese's vigorous pacing and eye for detail hold it all together and provide a vivid setting for DiCaprio's masterful performance.Scorsese gives us a lot more than the Charles Foster Kane of the clouds. He keeps focus on Hughes, the dreamer, who continually reached out, grabbed the future and pulled it toward him.But still,the story almost predictable in the way it delivers the cinematic goods, yet there's no denying that it is a compelling and entertaining look at a larger-than-life individual.This biopic of Howard Hughes is being hailed as another excellent film."
"ringfire211","8","1","2","29 December 2011"," DiCaprio and Blanchett make this work!!
","I was pleasantly surprised by it. Didn't know what to expect. I was quite impressed with a few of the biopics I've seen - WALK THE LINE, RAY, MIRACLE (that one is more about the Miracle on Ice win but also focuses greatly on the coach Herb Brooks) so I decided to give THE AVIATOR a whirl (ahem). DiCaprio in recent years has proved himself to be quite the actor so I really wanted to see his take on Howard Hughes. Let me tell ya - DiCaprio hit this one out of the park!! By far his best performance!! The mannerisms and all the foibles/compulsive disorders that he brought out in his performance were outstanding!! <br/><br/>I immediately went and read up as much as I could about Hughes and his life. I was already a bit fascinated with this man even before seeing the film - although I must admit that my fascination stemmed more from his latter years as a recluse and the fact that Jimmy Dean's Willard Whyte character in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER was based on him. But I had no idea he played such a huge part in aviation and in the film business earlier in his life. That part of his life I knew almost nothing about. And it was DiCaprio's performance that fed my interest in the man even more. Bravo, Leo!! <br/><br/>And then there's Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn - a maaaarvelous performance!! I was like... DAYUM!!! She IS Hepburn!! Leo and Cate basically made this movie for me. Up until then my favorite lead performances of 2004 were Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks. Both did a splendid job. But sorry... Leo beats them both!!"

","The Aviator is a true story based on the life of billionaire aviator and film producer, Howard Hughes. In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect for the role are Hughes because DiCaprio not only had experience in playing 'real life' people before as he played Frank Abagnale Jr in 'Catch Me If You Can' but because he clearly understands what type of character the director Martin Scorsese wanted. DiCaprio really demonstrated a perfect example of someone Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, so well in fact that it earned him his second Oscar Nomination in 2004. Also stellar performances by Cate Blanchette who won the Oscar that year as the beautiful actress Katharine Hepburn. I was very impressed with her in this movie as she was so flawlessly realistic with her characters personality. I was also very impressed with Alan Alda's honest performance; he also received an Oscar nomination. Over all, this film leaves you with a sighing wow. It's a love story as much as it is dramatic and painful. It has great make up, costumes and special effects. It really makes you feel like you are experiencing life in the 1930's."
"estreet-eva","7","1","2","6 December 2011"," Epic craziness.
","Crafting a biopic about Howard Hughes is like running downhill - no more interesting and complex personage graced the 20th century and perhaps with the exception of Ben Franklin and maybe Abraham Lincoln maybe all of United States history. The challenge Martin Scorsese faced involved mostly keeping the fascinating stories about Hughes to just the film's 170 minute running time. Scorsese holds the movie to under 3 hours by focusing only on Hughes' establishment of TWA and Hughes Aircraft and his film production career. Although this period probably covers the most cinematic of Hughes' adventures it does miss his rise to become the biggest employer in Nevada, stints living in London, South America and finally the Caribbean. It also only covers just the early days of his madness which progresses to a far more debilitating stage later in his life. Leonard DiCaprio delves into this madness and the Hughes' genius delivering a convincing and compelling role. He never quite loses himself in the role in the way Charlize Theron could no longer be discerned in her performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos - we always see DiCaprio behind the character. DiCaprio appears in nearly every shot but he receives the support of some excellent casting choices including Cate Blanchett , who took home an Oscar for the performance and the highly underutilized Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and John C. Reilly. The editing of their work under can be choppy at times particularly in the beginning where titles describing the action and timeframe become necessary to keep things straight. However, once the film settles into more linear storytelling and its focus on Hughes' romance of Katharine Hepburn the nearly three hour run time moves as smoothly and quickly as one of Hughes' more successful aircraft designs. In short, the excellence of ""The Aviator"" and the genius and psychosis of its subject invite a sequel from Scorsese."
"DarthVoorhees","10","1","2","11 November 2009"," ""Come in with the milk""
","Scorcese has achieved a brilliance in a film that it is against his type. Scorcese is making a film not only about Howard Hughes but the times and the culture he embodied. It does not try to exploit our hero's underside. Instead 'The Aviator' plays like a great Shakespeare tragedy. Howard Hughes was a larger than life man who in the end was exploited and destroyed only by himself.<br/><br/>Again I expected any film about Hughes to exploit his OCD. Scorcese doesn't do that. Of course as the film progresses he tip toes ever closer to his tragic fate, but the film isn't built to get him to his Las Vegas penthouse. The film is built around Hughes trying to ensure his place in American history and what it means to be an American. Scorcese shows Hughes as an innovator and a dreamer. Whose love for Aviation brought him out of the screening room for a final showdown with a corrupt Congressional committee to ensure his place as an American hero. This is the only way to do a film about Hughes.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has never been finer than he is in this film. He is able to embody all the facets of Hughes life as he progresses from boy wonder to Hollywood playboy to tragic mad man. If ever Oscar consideration mattered for DiCaprio it is in his turn as Hughes. Physically DiCaprio always has a boy like quality, but here he transforms into Hughes. There is an absolutely brilliant close up Scorcese shows into an aging Hughes face. We see the bags under his eyes and forget they belong to DiCaprio. He gives a full performance.<br/><br/>Historical liberties were taken in this film and I really don't care that they were. I have trouble believing that Hughes relationship with Katherine Hepburn was as significant as the film seems to suggest it was. In all fairness I think Hughes probably never truly loved a woman as much as he loved and hated himself. Cate Blanchett deserves great praise though for her performance as Hepburn. Hepburn impressions are a dime a dozen. I don't think Blanchett is impersonating Hepburn though. She offers her own distinct voice on this character. The most moving scene is when Hepburn talks to Hughes through the door of his personal isolation. Hepburn comes from a vantage point of pity for Hughes, it is as tragic as the brilliant ending.<br/><br/>Even better than Blanchett though is Kate Beckingsale's fantastic turn as Ava Gardner. I found she had even more presence than Hepburn. Hughes is deeply attracted to her spunkiness and is fascinated by her. He loves the fact that he can't buy her like the other ""employees"". Twice he asks to marry her only to get a negative answer. In fact I'd say the film suggests that Gardner had even more of an impact on Hughes than Hepburn. She is the one with the courage to cut down the germ tape and prepare Howard for Washington.<br/><br/>The film has an all together great ensemble though. I think John C. Reily and Matt Ross were both deserving of Oscar recognition as well. Scorcese could be dealing with the most well rounded cast he ever dealt with. Sure the film belongs to Howard as it should but Howard is the sum of the people around him. ""Everyone works for you Howard."" In the end though Howard reaches his peak. I think the ending is one of the most tragic and poignant scenes in Scorcese's filmography or even motion picture history for that matter. Hughes embraces the fact that he will never again touch the sky and grounds himself to his inner demons. It's a haunting scene beginning with men who look like ghosts of Howard's future with rubber gloves looking at him. Reily's character bluntly says no one is to seem him like this and the door shuts on Howard Hughes forever. Tragic but it perfectly represents the spirit of the film. America has the power to create as well as destroy."
"marcusdean118","10","1","2","18 December 2008"," A fantastic film.
","This is a fantastic story of a man who had it all and quickly lost it. Scorsese presents us with a fascinating look at the world of showbusiness but in a completely three dimensional way. With some people thinking this film is just about the glitz and nothing else, they just need to take one look at Leonardo Dicaprios performance. Not only do i strongly disagree with the academy favouring Jamie Foxx's unremarkable depiction of Ray Charles but i also feel that this one of the most remarkable displays of acting in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Scorsese uses his a-list cast to perfection. Alec Baldwin is used to perfection in a small role. Cate Blanchett shines and deservedly wins an Oscar for it. Alda shows us that actors do improve with age. And smaller roles from the likes of Beckinsale and Jude Law show us that there's a reason these actors wanted to be part of this movie. And its simply because, it's brilliant."
"Lejink","9","1","2","13 May 2008"," High flying bird
","Modern epic cinema of the highest order and proof that there's life in the old dog yet as Scorcese fashions a spectacular drama around the ""living years"" of celebrated billionaire, inventor, recluse and all-round megalomaniac, Howard Hughes. In fact perhaps the only nondescript thing about the whole enterprise is the rather dull title, otherwise there's much to feast on here. Scorcese has shown himself at home with the milieu of America in the 30's and 40's (I'm thinking particularly of his in my opinion unjustly overlooked masterpiece, ""New York New York""), but here the drama is embellished by edge-of-your-seat special effects, especially the aerial ballet of the filming of ""Hell's Angels"" to the judderingly realistic plane crash when Hughes personally takes up one of his prototype aircraft. At the heart of the whole is Leonardo De Caprio delivering a superb turn as the by turns electric then desolate Hughes driven on but eventually driven down by his inner demons. This is a performance of great maturity, as the Hughes character moves from the years 1926 - 1946 during which time he assumes the roles of gung-ho film director, billionaire playboy, maverick inventor, spendthrift magnate to his eventual succumbing to the madness of his obsessive behaviour disorder, manifested most of all in his obsession for cleanliness. The remainder of the ensemble is mostly fine, with Kate Beckinsale alluring and headstrong as Ava Gardener, Alex Baldwin formidable as Hughes' nemesis at Pan-Am, Juan Tryppe and Alan Alda (long time no see) just right as Tryppe's man-at-Congress, Senator Brewster who attempts to bring down Hughes at a post-war Senate hearing but gets bitten himself as Hughes turns the tables on him. Less satisfactory is Cate Blanchett in another of her true-life impersonations, not quite looking or sounding enough like Kate Hepburn to convince, difficult task as that is. Perhaps the film lionises Hughes a little too much as at times he was clearly an unsavoury, selfish and cruel person, which his illnesses can never fully excuse - consider the point, for example, too lightly made, that three stunt men died during the making of ""Hell's Angels"", his WW1 flying epic or that his two ""triumphs"", which bookend the film, the eventual release of ""Hell's Angels"" after years in production and Hughes' successful piloting of the massive ""Spruce Goose"" / ""Hercules"" sea-plane on her test-flight, were Pyrrhic victories at best (""Hell's Angels"", for all its box-office success, failed to recoup its huge production costs and the Hercules never made it into commercial production) and symptomatic of Hughes' delusions of grandeur. A man with his money and flair could have left far more lasting legacies than these and I don't think Scorcese makes that point (or even wished to), which is no doubt why we don't get to witness Hughes complete submission to his illness in his old age. Nevertheless this is a bravura piece of Hollywood mythologising with the veteran director expertly marshaling his massive resources in creating a wonderful movie that sweeps you into a whole other world and the not-quite ""beautiful mind"" of a gifted but tragically flawed individual."

Although, I have to point out that the language is rather a big disappointment. In addition to the unnecessary f-word used by Alec Baldwin's character.

","I give this movie 9 out of 10 for the rather unusual color scheme the director picked. It has the appearance of a colorized black and white movie from the 1920's and 30's. Not bad for a film made in the era of bling-bling and grotesque remakes. We are introduced to the life of Howard Hughes, eccentric millionaire and ace pilot. DiCaprio plays this character with Titanic-like perfection that is tolerable for someone who still sounds like a 16 year-old going through puberty. The special effects are wonderful and not overblown excuse to cover up horrible acting. Cate Blanchett makes a terrific Kathrine Hepburn the way she sounds and behaves is uncanny. The only thing that is missing from that performance is the famous quote: ""You're my night in shining armor."" But what really makes the movie stand out is the ""Big band-style Jazz"" that leaps out at you and makes you a part of the film. <br/><br/>In the age of CGI overload and the industry cries of priacy despite the retarded decision to churn out silly dimwitted comedies such as ""Garfield"" and ""Taxi"" (not the 70's sitcom)and horrible remakes case-in-point ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" there is hope and sanctuary from these mindless experiments gone awry. Film such as ""The Aviator"" are one of those sanctuaries for our viewing pleasure. ""It can't be! Hollywood still actually makes movies?"" Maybe I was a little too hard on the new generation of films, but it's not the same as in ages past."

Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm, Danny Huston, Gwen Stefani, Jude Law, Adam Scott, Matt Ross, Willem Dafoe...Director Martin Scorcese, Screenplay John Logan ""The Aviator"" was an enjoyable trip back to the life and times of Howard Hughes, an eccentric and reclusive billionaire who among his many accomplishments established a Las Vegas we have all come to know, built the legendary Spruce Goose airplane and was involved in the making of some notably controversial films of his time. While this is not exactly a biopic, and some aspects of his life are not touched, it remains a dramatically compelling film. Leonardo Dicpario, donning Howard Hughes ""look, voice and finely tailored suites"" lives the character and is doing a heck of a performance, one which should have earned him an Oscar for Best Actor. He is especially convincing as the young Howard Hughes, when he was charismatic, defiant and charming the likes of Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner and other celebrities. The cinematography by Robert Richardson pays tribute to the 30's and 40's and the costumes, although too colorful an array, is still reminiscent of old Hollywood glamour. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn is a riot, though her performance is clearly over-the-top, attempting to be more funny than serious and for me, she did not capture the spirit of the late great actress. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages to epitomize the strong-willed spirit of Ava Gardner, who, after living the hell of Hughes' constant scrutiny and insecurities, makes the decision to leave him and we applaud her for it. Howard Hughes is not portrayed in a heroic light. His flaws are quite visible and it's genuinely moving to see him fall to pieces as he suffers from schizophrenia and OCD. The rest of the A-list cast include John C. Reilly as Noa Ditrich, a friend of Hughes, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, out to expose Hughes as a fraud, Alan Alda as the tough Senator Brewster, Ian Holm as the very egocentric Professor Fitz, Jude Law portrays swashbuckling star Errol Flynn and Willem Dafoe in the minor role of Roland Sweet. There are moments of breathtaking beauty, such as the scenes which involve plane flight. His many airplane creations are computer-generated images but have a realistic quality to them on screen. Certain portions are quite disturbing, not the least of them being Hughes' nearly fatal plane accident which leaves him burned, scarred and maimed. A great film which won some Oscars, especially for production, but which should have been noted for its performing stars. If you're a fan of Howard Hughes and his time, this is a fine, dramatic and romanticized account of his life."

","The Aviator/2004/ <br/><br/>Main Stars:<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale I never knew Howard Hughes's life was really that interesting. I thought that Howard Hughes was just a rich obsessive-compulsive guy who wasn't worth knowing about. When I saw this movie that thought definitely went away. He really had a big influence on planes and movies about them. Of course, seeing Leonardo DiCaprio's buttocks was extremely nauseating but the movie itself was amazing! Some people may be familiar with the movie ""Hell's Angels"" (a movie about World War I) and in this movie there was a big scene about that with planes flying around like one hundred birds in the air. What I really thought was amazing in this movie was the cinematography (the filming) because of how the camera moved around it is really difficult to explain why it was so good but in my opinion, it just was. Actually, the movie did win an Academy Award for the cinematography so apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this movie had really good filming. As you probably know, this movie won a few Academy Awards and was nominated for a few more besides cinematography and I thought it really deserved that. I especially wanted Leonardo DiCaprio (playing Howard Hughes) to win an Academy Award for Best Actor but he was only nominated for that. He, along with Cate Blanchett (playing Katherine Hepburn) and Kate Beckinsale (playing Ava Gardner) were the best actors (actresses) in the movie. Howard Hughes is known to be obsessive-compulsive. He also is known to be one of the most famous aviators of all time. Katherine Hepburn is known to be outgoing, independent, and to me she seems quite annoying in a way. And Ava Gardner is known to be adventurous, quite calm, and also independent. In my opinion, the actor and actresses that played them played their roles perfectly. In my opinion, nothing at all was boring in this movie but my brother really thought so because he doesn't like these types of movies at all. He really is a big fan of vulgar comedies. Anyway, in this last sentence, I will tell you what this movie was about- this movie was specifically about the history of Howard Hughes's life. I'm sorry for a very long review but there's just a whole lot to talk about in this classic film. By the way, this movie is very long (about three hours) and I think you know what I am going to tell you- go to the bathroom. Movie directed by Martin Scorsese."

","Oh gosh. What can I say about this film? Will try to list my comments in order of importance as they seem to me: First, I'm sorry, because I really like DiCaprio. I do. But he just isn't right for this part. Why did they cast him in this? This ruined the film for me because there is just something about DiCaprio -- especially with his baby-face-like physicality -- that just could never ever ""scream"" Howard Hughes to me. The best way to ruin a film for me is to cast someone so wrong for the part that I can never forget throughout the entire movie, that I am watching an ACTOR. In this case, that was 3 hours of noticing I was watching acting. I couldn't help it. He was just so NOT Howard Hughes. I think the very hardest thing to cast is a role for a biopic of a non-fictional and well-known person. It's tough. When it's good it's great, and when it's not, it's just plain aggravating for the viewer. Don't get me wrong. I think DiCaprio did a fine job of acting. He was just miscast in this role. I could have bought Willem Dafoe more than DiCaprio -- and that's just pulling a name out of the top of my hat! The cinematography was excellent. There were many good actors, and a number of my favorites, in this film. And sometimes the story is interesting despite the aggravations. I liked what I learned new about Hughes, and now I want to read more about him. I know I'll get a better sense from books though! And finally, I only want to watch a 3-hour movie when it is really great. This movie didn't warrant 3 hours to me. Ghandi, yes; The Aviator, no."

Martin Scorcese of course, does a marvelous job of taking us back in time. This time during the 1930's, when everything was almost coming down, except for the extremely rich. DiCaprio is actually quite fun as Hughes, playing every tick and nuance (I was especially impressed with how he portrayed his obsessive-compulsive disorder). The supporting actors are all great too with of course the truly amazing Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. I'm just amazed she pulled this almost impossible task off the way she did.. No wonder she won an Oscar for it! All the rest of the cast is quite good too. (I especially loved my main man Alec Baldwin as the sneaky Pan Am Chief.. Go Alec!). The only problem I had happens 2/3 of the way through, with Hughes' dementia getting progressively worse. I think that segment could've been trimmed down somewhat. Finally, I just love the in-joke that no one seems have picked up on with the throwaway line about the preview of Lon Chaney's 'London After Midnight', which is a classically 'lost' film, and a film Scorsese is nuts about, so that was interesting."

Yet AMPAS again refused to reward the best and the brightest. One wonders how these voters could overlook such marvelous work by a leading actor and one of our two greatest living directors. Seems like a waste of good money for the Academy to send out screeners when it is apparent that their members are not watching them. Once again we see voting based on who knows who and not who knew how. No wonder Billy Crystal and Chris Rock don't want to do the Oscars again. No wonder I don't watch them anymore."
"buiger","7","1","2","1 January 2006"," Not bad, but...
","I didn't find this film to be anything more than a solid piece of work, definitely not one of the great movies of our time.<br/><br/>Scorsese just can't seem to get it right any more! After the total catastrophe with ""Gangs of New York"" he now tries again with Di Caprio in The Aviator. One major flaw in this film in my opinion is the casting of Di Caprio for the role of H.Hughes. He just isn't right for the part, which cannot be said for Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale both of whom do a great job impersonating respectively K.Hepburn and A.Gardner.<br/><br/>The second and to me most important flaw is in the script. The characters are not well developed and the storyline is somehow discontinuous. As a result, we never really understand who Howard Hughes really was, what he felt, what the relationship between him and the women in his life really was, and ultimately as a consequence, we cannot feel for him. To be great, a movie has to generate some kind of emotional response in the viewer, and this one doesn't, it leaves us cold. It would have been different if the film had spent much more time in showing Hughes' feelings, his doubts, his financial troubles and how he risked to overcome them. Instead, in the film it seems that he was just an eccentric genius who had some great ideas and who needed only to order his people to ""fix it"" in order to have them realized. Nobody's life is that simple, and I cannot imagine Hughe's was either.<br/><br/>In other, camera and special effects where rather good and not exaggerated, the sound average. The overall large amount of Oscars and Nominations the film received is in my opinion, undeserved. All in all, The Aviator is a mediocre to good, but not great, filmed biography that will probably soon be forgotten."

","There's no such thing as the perfect movie, but I consider myself a harsh critic and The Aviator was immediately one of my favorites. It's one of the only movies I've ever seen twice in the theater. If it had been performed live, I would have been on my feet at the curtain drop. I have heard some people say they didn't like it, mainly because it was either too dark or too slow. In my opinion, it was right on target as far as the mood created by the film in relation to Howard Hughes' life. The balance, especially, was appropriate. It would be hard to respect a biographical movie about a real person (with a life much darker than was depicted by the movie, I might add) if that movie ignored one of the most important characteristics of its star. Hughes led a tragic life. I'm a fan of creative artistry in film, as opposed to disliking a movie if it doesn't have a fast pace or lots of emotional evocation from the audience. That being said, I found the Aviator to be a fantastic display of cinematic mastery (and I'm not even a huge Scorsese fan). It is one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen (especially for young people), and the thrill of dramatic events in history being made by Hughes are portrayed in a way that really captivated my own thrill and even caused me to forget about the movie theater I was sitting in at times (a rare thing). The best part about it is its historic accuracy - excellent for Hollywood, especially in a movie that was made to astound the audience. It's true, the tone is dark for a lot of the movie, but it's rightfully so. Howard Hughes led an astounding but privately tragic life, and I see that translated on screen in an appropriate-for-a-movie manner. Not too depressing, but not to flippant. And there's plenty of breathtaking action if that's what you're looking for. On a side note, I have never liked Leonardo DiCaprio. I take credit for some of his not-so-romantic nicknames. But in The Aviator, I find, he has finally come into his won as an actor. Until now I've seen his acting as immature and green, but he has finally become a man. Not only that, but I applaud Scorsese for casting Leo because there are times when the physical similarity between him and Hughes is amazing. I never would have guessed.<br/><br/>My recommendation: read a quick online biography or two about Howard Hughes before you see the film. I did, and I found his life story fascinating, not to mention that it complements the movie and makes it much more enjoyable to watch - being well informed about what's going on."
"Golgo-13","9","1","2","2 September 2005"," I get mad when people touch my peas toodisturbingly mad.
","In my opinion, out of the nominated films for best picture, The Aviator is the movie that should have won, along with Scorsese as director. The story of Howard Hughes is a fascinating one; on one hand, a forward-thinker and genius of aviation (among many, many other things) and on the other, a man crippled by obsessive-compulsive disorder. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the lead and the movie (focusing more on Hughes' younger years) is an amazing, enjoyable watch from start to finish. Nice work with the CGI too. The commentary is decent, as are the other DVD extras. If you want to learn more about Hughes, the History Channel documentary on disc two is the thing to watch."

","Having missed The Aviator in the theaters, I purchased a used DVD from my local video chain for a bargain $9.99 and watched it over three days while exercising on the treadmill.<br/><br/>I found this movie very, very entertaining, and it made the minutes on my treadmill seem like seconds. but... Leonardo DeCaprio never convinced me that he was Howard Hughes. In other films, the performances were so good that the actor became the character (Malcom X and Ray come to mind). But my only real gripe about this movie is the ending.It almost felt as if the director was leaving the door open for an Aviator, Part II. We never know what became of the Senate Hearings and we never know what became of the potential purchase of TWA. Despite this, I found it an excellent depiction of a fascinating era in American History. I saw Million Dollar Baby and, in my opinion, this is a FAR superior picture, though no better than an 8."
"PWNYCNY","8","1","2","2 August 2005"," Solid Movie about Howard Hughes.
","Okay, I'm still recovering from ""The Titanic"" debacle, so I didn't buy into Leonardo Di Caprio playing Howard Hughes, and although Kate Blanchett's portrayal of Kathryn Hepburn was shrill and annoying, and the pseudo-psychology used to explain Mr. Hughes's idiosyncrasies were flat-out crude and ludicrous, and the scene where Mr. Hughes is staggering around in his hotel room naked utterly devoid of any entertainment value, still this is a solid movie. It's a solid movie because of the life of Howard Hughes itself. The story of Howard Hughes is not his mental illness, nor his affair with Kathryn Hepburn, nor his run-in with Congress. Rather the story of Howard Hughes is about what Hughes did, what he built, what he accomplished, what an incredibly great and gifted man he was. He was rich man, but he was also a worker, a test pilot, a builder, an innovator, an inventor, as well as a pioneer Hollywood producer and director. No matter how hard this movie tries to portray Mr. Hughes as some kind of oddball, and no matter how unbelievable and superficial is Mr. Di Caprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes, the man's accomplishments could not be ignored or denigrated, even in this movie, and they speak for themselves. So Howard Hughes had mental problems? So what? What is important is what Howard Hughes did, and for that reason this movie should be watched."
"RamenNoodle","7","1","2","18 July 2005"," A Mediocre Telling Of Howard Hughes
","Hands down this movie gave as much info on Howard that I could've read in a big worded coloring book. Other then that I absolutely enjoyed it. The acting is all their. Cate Blanchett is absolutely stunning by the way.<br/><br/>Let's start off with the premise. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Howard Hughes. The eccentric millionaire/Director/Airplane Designer. The entire first half of the movie which is about 1 hour and 45 minutes revolves around Howard Hughes going to parties and dating some women. Sounds boring? Well your right. It probably won an award at Bore Fest 2005 this year but if you can sit through this treachery the movie shines. It starts off by using everything that The People Vs. Larry Flynt used. It has Howard traumatized and completely changed from a devastating plane wreck and then he is goes to the downward spiral and lands in court for some naughty deeds. The courtroom scenes are quite pathetic I might add. Little emotion is shown in these scenes. And then it ends quite abruptly and that's about it.<br/><br/>So In the end what do we know? We know if you read a one page summary on Howard Hughes then you know pratically everything they tell you about him in the film. I would recommend for the big move buffs but for the small time movie goer stay away from the 3 hour behemoth."

","Enter with an open mind and you'll be richly rewarded with Scorsese's meticulous rendering of Howard Hughe's genius and its demise. But don't expect to fall into a comfortable narrative drama. THE AVIATOR is more like CITIZEN KANE, almost a newsreel that conveys the power of a brilliant man driven by his own vision against all odds. <br/><br/>Despite this stark and challenging frame, Scorsese and his wonderful team, including set designer Dante Feretti and a score of talented actors, still is able to convey Hughes' fragile humanity as he struggles to control the delusions and paranoia that eventually destroy his life. At the end of the movie, one mourns for Hughes as one mourned for Kane -- the loss of one man who labored a lifetime to overcome a childhood trauma and achieved great things. <br/><br/>Of course Scorsese's film is more than that. He coaxes a magnificently mature and nuanced performance out of Leonardo DiCaprio, and may even win him an Oscar. Cate Blanchette as Kate Hepburn at first seems excessive, until her veneer begins to peel away -- again a tribute to Scorsese's skill as a director, and Blanchette's bountiful acting abilities.<br/><br/>The three hours went quickly as one fabulous scene and set replaced another. The vintage clips of HELL'S ANGELS interspersed with new footage are, alone, worth the price of admission. Without giving away the ending, go see the old planes fly. <br/><br/>Don't miss seeing this wonderful film on the big screen. It's a masterpiece."
"RichardJSampson","9","1","2","13 June 2005"," An imperfect movie, but genuinely touching nonetheless
","Prior to seeing this film, I noticed that general opinion was generally, but certainly not unanimously positive, so that put me on the skeptical side of things as I think a lot of biopic films seem to have a tendency to get the benefit of the doubt from critics. Add to that big name directors and stars, and I felt the makings of a drippy period piece set to abuse its poetic license.<br/><br/>But my skepticism, I feel, was misplaced. Most negative reviews focus of flaws in the narrative or deviations from the traditional plot arcs we've come to expect and appreciate in films. It's also been said that a familiarity with Howard Hughes' life is necessary to get any depth from the film. I think these criticisms distract from what the movie seems to be trying to achieve. While I do agree that the plot can seem disjointed, the running time of 170 minutes is quite a temporal investment, and yes: the brief scene of Hughes' childhood that opens the film before a dizzying fast forward to him as a young adult feels gratuitous and tacked on, there really was something in DiCaprio's performance and Scorsese's attitude towards his protagonist was genuinely touching in a way that lacked sappy, typical (and dare I say, Spielbergesque) manipulative feel of other films.<br/><br/>Here's the place from which I'm approaching the film: I am a pilot, for personal recreation only, who can relate to Howard Hughes' passion for the sky. Yet, I didn't see this film until recently because frankly, I couldn't have cared less about his biography. I simply knew he was crazy, built and flew the Spruce Goose, and was a partial inspiration for Mr. Burns on the Simpsons. But after watching The Aviator, I had a new appreciation for Mr. Hughes that really grew later on in the film, as I felt it more and more difficult to watch. Scorsese clearly feels a respect and pity for the man, which we -- the audience -- feel too. I went from a disinterested movie buff to someone who felt a lump in his throat over the real-life tragedy that was Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Hughes was suffering from what we all know today to be Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). As the scenes of his successes become progressively more inter-cut with scenes of the very real symptoms of this disease, I found my heart breaking for Howard as a condition beyond his control and medical understanding (at the time) destroyed all that his genius and charisma had built. At one point later on in the film, Hughes is close to rock bottom in the darkness of his illness and at a very problematic time: He is to confront the senate on allegations fabricated by his competition attempting to wipe him out. An old flame, long disheartened by his descent into madness, arrives to help make him presentable to the public. Afterwards, the woman is hopelessly asked by Howard, having long been in a relationship with another man, to marry Hughes. Of course she refuses, and it doesn't come across that Hughes had high hopes for such a prospect anyway, but I think I understood the essence of who this Aviator was, and what Scorsese was trying to tell us about him. Perhaps what Hughes simply needed, perhaps what he lacked, was just someone to take care of him. Being afflicted with syphilis early in his life (which has neurological consequences later on) and possibly suffering head trauma from a plane crash he barely survived, Hughes was a genius with a severe handicap, and maybe his demise wouldn't have been as it was if he had just had help.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the true story is that psychiatry didn't know how to treat such conditions at the time, and people were naturally too weirded out by the manifestations of his disease to be of any true help to him. Hughes is a tragic character, and I commend Scorsese for drawing me into the history of the man to appreciate his genius and mourn his circumstances.<br/><br/>Artistically, cinematic ally, and narratively, this movie is no knock-out. But what a journey it was, and a genuinely heart-felt one at that, into the world of a great American at the mercy of his demons. It's not Raging Bull, it's not a classic for the ages, but I believe it accomplishes precisely what it set out to do: Reveal the humanity of a man that the late stages of disease had previously reduced to a caricature."

","This movie was quite long, but I was able to endure it. It was a great movie that shows the highs and lows of life. The scarlets were amazing, including: the sets, costumes, music, and flying stunts. Not your typical long bad movie. Gwen Stafani from No Doubt, looked great and didn't have a big enough role, but in any event she looked great. I thought the casting was really good from Alan Alda to Leonardo. Usually I try to avoid Leonardo DiCaprio movies like the plague, but he actually acted rather well. I hope a lot of Leo haters get to enjoy this movie, I really did. The casting of Hepburn with Cate Blanchett was right on the money. Her accent got more thick as she aged which was very realistic."

","While ""The Aviator"" is by no means a badly made movie, it isn't what this reviewer would call a compelling enough film to own or to watch more than once. That is of course unless your extremely fascinated by Howard Hughes, planes, or aviation history in general.<br/><br/>Yes, Howard Hughes was an eccentric, obsessive compulsive billionaire who had his share of Hollywood romances. And indeed, he is an important historical figure.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" suffers from one main thing: script! This biographical account of Howard Hughes just isn't that intriguing to watch more than once. With all the millions spent on the production and the actors, it would have been nicer to see a more enticing script & dialogue that would prove worthy of multiple viewings.<br/><br/>Leo, Cate, John C Reilly, Kate Beckinsale and all the others due fine jobs in the film. Leo is an outstanding actor, and so are the others. His portrayal of Hughes is just fine, and I doubt that anyone could have done any better.<br/><br/>After viewing any film, one has to ask themselves...""would I want to see this again""? Some people are more than content seeing a movie only once, and then moving on to the next film.<br/><br/>What I find to make the difference between good and great movies, are the ones that leave the audience wanting more: whether in the form of a sequel or in the form of a repeat viewing.<br/><br/>At almost 3 hours long, I had had enough of ""The Aviator"" by the time it was done.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw it once, but I wouldn't want to see any more. On the contrary, a film like this might have proved better by the ""less is more"" theory.<br/><br/>Oscar worthy? No...not really. Not for best film or director that is for sure. Leo deserved his nod for ""Best Actor"", but I can clearly see why Cate Blanchett walked away from the Oscars with the real victory of the film. Her performance of Katherine Hepburn was short and exhilarating - which is one thing that the rest of ""The Aviator"" could have benefited from. The crash scene in ""The Aviator"" does stands out as a very livid and intense sequence though. It's a very well done segment.<br/><br/>If you go into ""The Aviator"" with no expectations and without believing all the ""hype"" that it's such a fantastic movie, then it shouldn't fail to disappoint you. Otherwise, it more than likely will. By the time the end rolls around, ""The Aviator"" can only be summed up as just an ""O.k."" movie.<br/><br/>Worth the rental, but for the movie itself (excluding extra features); just not worth the entry in this reviewers DVD collection"
"Amnes","6","1","2","9 June 2005"," Sometimes Mr Scorses is just too in awe of other 'name' directors. A homage to Citizen Kane.
","I was a little disappointed by this very long film, although Mr Scorsese's more recent work isn't great.<br/><br/>Firstly I think Leo Dicaprio is miscast, terribly miscast as HH. He (HH) was well-known to be a tall dark-haired man and DiCaprios makes no effort to shed his 'boy band' looks here, which makes the film unbelievable from the start. DiCaprio is generally unconvincing and out of his depth here.<br/><br/>Some of the other casting is questionable, it takes a while to get used to Cate Blanchett doing Kate Hepburn, it's too hard to forget it's Cate Blanchett, but she does well enough in the role, after a while...it can easily descend into 'camp' this type of role, so it's a relief that she manages to avoid that. Generally the best dialogue is between these two characters.<br/><br/>I think Scorcese was too in awe and too conscious of ""Citizen Kane"" in making this film and it often seems like a weaker version or a homage to that picture.<br/><br/>The actually building of an aviation empire is interesting, as is the 'war' between rival moguls and their tame politicians but this is also the stuff that makes it a Citizen Kane clone-pic.<br/><br/>I think HH was a phenomenally interesting subject and the film doesn't do him justice.<br/><br/>It's just an 'ok' film."

","I gave this film a five - OK the camera shots move a lot and the nervy way that they portray Hughes is sometimes a bit to much to take in without a break in concentration, but the film generally is good, although at times slow. If you read a short write up first of Howard Hughes then it will help you to better understanding the film and why it was made in this way, simply because that is how he was and to work with him must have been a nightmare. But he is one of histories greats and if not for any over reason a insight to this man and his achievements cannot due you any harm. Definitely not one for the collection but worth giving a go."
"TOMASBBloodhound","5","1","2","31 May 2005"," Too big and bloated to really get airborne. Like that plane.
","Like the ""Spruce Goose"" or ""Hercules"" as it was called, this film just cannot soar to the heights its makers intended. Though a great-looking picture, and full of great performers, the film is too long and lacks any truly gripping moments. Leonardo DiCaprio cannot sell me on the fact that he is Howard Hughes, nor did Scorsese sell me on his need to tell the story.<br/><br/>The Aviator is the story of eccentric filmmaker, inventor, and playboy Howard Hughes. After an early snippet from his childhood (which is never properly explained) we see him attempt to make an epic film with his own money involving hundreds of planes, actors, and a lot of cameras. The parts of the film dealing with Hughes the filmmaker are some of its finest moments. We see his obsession with perfection and his own vision triumph when everyone else around him plays the part of naysayer. By the second half of the film, we mostly see Hughes battle to save TWA airlines from a dirty senator and the owner of Pan Am. We also see Hughes become increasingly paralyzed and anti-social due to his fear of germs and human contact. Strangely enough, he is scared to death of things like a speck of lint on a colleague's clothes, yet he'll apparently jump in the sack with any young woman he sees. That inconsistency of his character is not fully explained to the extent I would have liked to have seen. The film concludes with Hughes repeating a line of dialog into a mirror like a broken record after finally getting his giant plane to fly around for a while.<br/><br/>Honestly, this film is no more helpful in providing an explanation of Hughes than any one-hour documentary on the History Channel could have been. His affairs are not that interesting, nor is his battle with the senator. His time sequestered in a screening room urinating in those milk bottles was intriguing, but not much of a payoff comes from it. The Howard Hughes this film presents us with seems normal in one scene, then merely functional in the next, then downright looney a few minutes later. The film really doesn't go to great lengths to explain any of it, though.<br/><br/>One word about DiCaprio... This guy just doesn't have it yet. Maybe some day he will, but all the accolades he got from this performance are simply not justified. He never once made me believe he was Howard Hughes. I know he doesn't physically look the real guy, but that shouldn't matter. Anthony Hopkins doesn't look a thing like Nixon, yet by the end of that film, I truly believed he was our 37th(?) president. I could much sooner believe Cate Blanchett as Hepburn, or even Jude Law as Errol Flynn for that matter. Scorsese has used DiCaprio in his last two big budget films, and I don't think it payed off in either. I don't know, maybe Scorsese is the problem, but that is far less-likely. The film may have received 11 Oscar nominations, but the box office figures don't lie. It will need huge rental numbers to break even.<br/><br/>5 of 10 stars for The Aviator.<br/><br/>Better luck next time for Scorsese. The Hound has spoken on this matter."

Huge amounts of money were spent to insure historical accurateness. So what went wrong???<br/><br/>Anachronisms: Why would anyone in 1927 have wished for a date with Theda Bara? (Bara was at her prime between 1915 and 1919, and by 1927 she was a has-been in her early 40s!) Why would a posh nightclub feature a five year old song like ""I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise""? Why was there no washroom attendant in either lavatory scene? Did you catch the RED stop sign in the 1947 ""newsreel""? Hughes and Hepburn evidently meet in 1935, and Kate mentions that she is ""box office poison""; but this didn't come till after the making of ""Holiday"" in 1938, when she took a two-year break from making films. When Kate and Howard are dining at the Cocoanut Grove, circa 1935-36, the band plays & sings the 1930 Paul Whiteman arrangement of ""Happy Feet""! Again, after the success of the Hercules flight in 1947, the soundtrack features Glenn Miller's 1939 recording of ""Moonlight Serenade."" And did people in 1927 actually do the ""good news/bad news"" routine? (I think this originated in the 1970s.) There's more <br/><br/>Editing: I was totally distracted by the dish of ice cream in the ""ice cream"" scene. First Miss Domergue's hands are in her lap, and flash, there's a spoon in her hand, and flash again, it's the first view, and then back to the spoon. And when Hughes takes the dish away from her, the cherry is on top, then it's on the side, and now it's on the top again! After the Hercules flight, Hughes has one of his ""episodes,"" and assistants rush him outside. There's a great flourish as the tent door flap is drawn closed, but we look again and it's wide open. Again, there's more<br/><br/>Acting: A friend commented that Alec Baldwin can play no one other than Alec Baldwin. And DiCaprio is totally unconvincing as a captain of industry! He hardly ages, even though there's a 20 year time span, While the mustache adds a little age, he still has the voice and look of a boy, even though by now Hughes is in his 40s!! <br/><br/>By the way, what was with the blue grass and trees on the golf course?"

I don't want to whine too much and write this huge analysis that's just going to put into words the passion I have for this movie, but I couldn't keep my mouth shut any longer.<br/><br/>The Aviator is one entertaining and gripping film. What is most astounding about the criticisms of this film is that it is called empty and boring (too long many say).<br/><br/>Empty? No way. Maybe it's just me but the most complex and fascinating character on screen this year was Howard Hughes as played by DiCaprio. I'm now piling up the Hughes biographies as I discover the troubled soul that was this man. But he was also a visionary, a revolutionary (ask anybody in the aviation industry and he changed the business), a womanizer yes, but an extremely lonely man at heart. A man of many demons mostly haunted by OCD in what had to be one of the worst cases in known history, Howard Hughes that is. All these contradictions made Hughes the most intriguing character in film this year and I saw a lot of movies. Again maybe it's just me, but I was moved by the character of Hughes. And that last scene (spoiler) in front of the mirror is subtle but emotionally if you felt for the character it tears you apart.<br/><br/>Boring? I guess we didn't see the same film because I was pulled in from start to finish. I love the Hollywood nostalgia, the authentic and spectacular shots of airplanes. The glorious scene of the XF-11 crash in Beverly Hills surpasses the crash from Castaway as we feel we are crashing along with the character of Howard Hughes played by you know who (""I'm going down, I'm going down...that gives me chills). The glamorous Hollywood romances, the Kate Hepburn moments, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow, Faith Domergue, Hughes teenage lover, Noah Dietrich played by the great John C. Reilly (great moment: when Hughes wants to re-shoot his movie Hell's Angels, Dietrich asks ""Which part?"", Hughes replies: ""All of it"")...anyhow all to say that the film is filled with interesting characters, at least I thought so. And how about Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, Pan Am's President, that was his best performance in a long time. And let's not forget the trial scene which is as good as any court scene I've scene in some of the best movies, especially as it culminates in the launching of the Hercules, better known to the world as the Spruce Goose.<br/><br/>There's more to say, such as Scorsese's great direction, great art direction, music, cinematography, etc., but I'll stop here.

"JamesHitchcock","10","1","2","4 March 2005"," One of Scorsese's Greatest Achievements
","Howard Hughes has entered popular legend as an eccentric, half-mad recluse who also happened to be one of the richest men in the world. Martin Scorsese's biography reminds us that there was much more to the man than that. It deals with the earlier part of Hughes's life from the late twenties to the late forties when he achieved fame in a number of fields, as a pioneer aviator, as an aircraft designer, as Chief Executive of TWA, as a film-maker and as the lover of a number of beautiful women, mostly Hollywood actresses. The film deals with all these aspects of his life. It starts with Hughes working on ""Hell's Angels"", his epic film about pilots in the First World War, and goes on to chronicle his achievement in breaking the world air speed record, the building of the world's largest aircraft (a military transport plane officially known as the Hercules but dubbed the ""Spruce Goose"", an aircraft crash which nearly cost him his life, his battle to establish TWA in the face of political corruption which favoured his rivals Pan-Am, and his love affairs with Katherine Hepburn and Ava Gardner.<br/><br/>Hughes is very much the hero of the film, not its villain. He is, admittedly, a flawed hero, but then none of us are flawless- certainly not the heroes among us. He can be stubborn- for example, he insists on completing the Spruce Goose even after the military have cancelled their order and it should have become clear to him that there is no commercial future for the plane- and also ruthless, as when he blackmails a muckraking journalist who is threatening to publish a story about Hepburn. Throughout the film we are conscious of his struggles with the mental health problems- especially his paranoid fear of germs- that were to worsen in the latter part of his life. Nevertheless, we are always aware of the powerfully creative side of his personality, his flair for business and his combative spirit. This comes out most strongly at the end of the film when TWA's business is threatened by a Senate bill that would have given Pan-Am a monopoly on international air travel and Hughes is summoned to be interrogated before a Congressional committee about his business record. Hughes's enemies expect that he will be humiliated, but he is able to answer all the charges against him to such good effect that the bill is defeated.<br/><br/>Leonardo di Caprio was excellent as Hughes. I must admit that I have not always been his greatest admirer; he struck me as an untalented pretty-boy when I first saw him in ""Titanic"", and there was little in ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Beach"" or ""Gangs of New York"" to persuade me to change my mind. He was, admittedly, better in ""Catch Me If You Can"", but this was a light-hearted film very different in style to ""The Aviator"". He seems, however, to be maturing into a very good actor and succeeded in bringing out the various sides of Hughes's complex personality. Of the other performances, the two that stood out were Cate Blanchett's impersonation of Hepburn and Alan Alda as Hughes's enemy, the corrupt senator Owen Brewster who is more interested in serving the interests of Pan-Am than those of his constituents.<br/><br/>Apart from the high standard of acting, the film is distinguished by an equally high standard of cinematography. The aviation sequences are outstanding, the scene of the crash which nearly killed Hughes being particularly heart-stopping. Another thing that stood out for me, but which I have not seen much commented on elsewhere, was the film's use of satirical humour. I particularly liked the scene where Hughes meets Hepburn's wealthy and artistic family, who treat him with patronising condescension while revealing their own snobbish ignorance of business and technology, and the one where he defends his film ""The Outlaw"" in front of the film censorship board who are obsessed with Jane Russell's ""mammaries"". The main qualifications for the position of film censor seem to have been equal measures of obtuseness and prurience.<br/><br/>This is a long movie, but the life-story of a man as complex as Hughes is one that needs to be told at length. It is a long time since I have seen a filmed biography painted on such an broad canvas and told with such an epic sweep. The two which it most calls to mind are Richard Attenborough's two fine biographies of Gandhi and Chaplin. Like many others, I am at a loss to understand why it lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""Million Dollar Baby"". Did the Academy members, working in a predominantly liberal industry, dislike its relatively conservative, pro-business stance? Was the satire aimed at Hepburn's family a bit too close to the bone for some? Was Clint Eastwood preferred because he is closer to the Hollywood mainstream than the independent auteur Scorsese? Certainly, the Academy often seem to allow their hearts to rule their heads when it comes to Oscar voting, and Scorsese's films may be too emotionally cool for their tastes. Although ""The Aviator"" is perhaps warmer than some of his other films in this respect, it lacks the sentimentality which ""Million Dollar Baby"" possesses in abundance. To my mind,however, ""The Aviator"" is a masterpiece that I would rank among Scorsese's greatest achievements. 10/10"
"wishkah7","10","1","2","1 March 2005"," Leonardo DiCapprio does it again!
","The Aviator is an excellent movie, and the acting was superb. Leonardo DiCapprio plays millionaire Howard Hughes who first started off making movies such as ""Hell's Angels"" and then moved onto to make airplanes. Cate Blanchet's performance as Katherine Hepburn was incredible, that you can see the striking resemblance between them.<br/><br/>Also, this movie focuses on Howard Hughes's obsessive perfectionism. He wanted everything to be just perfect, and Leonardo DiCapprio pulled of the performance without a hitch! Howard Hughes was also famous for making the Spruce Goose, which is now a historical landmark! Too bad The Aviator didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture, seeing this movie you can see why it was Oscar worthy to begin with. I hope to see Leonardo DiCapprio in more great movies in the future. I give The Aviator 4 stars!"

","In my opinion, The Aviator is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, comparable to The Taxi Driver, Martin Scorsese has really outdone himself. It looks as if the movie was put together of little pieces, like different news stories... It's up to audience to put together the big picture. Which I liked the best was the unpredictability of the script. It is impossible to know even what happens in 10 minutes, everything the cast says or does is a surprise. Leo does a fantastic job in the leading role, giving the perfect impression of a complex character. Also, Cate Blanchett is absolutely terrific. She shows Katherine Hepburn realistically, adding a little bit of humor. Special effects are incredible, they spice up the film but don't draw the attention from the script. The Aviator would have been perfect Oscar material, sad that the Academy felt the other way. Hopefully Scorsese makes other films and finally gets the long deserved Oscar."

","Martin Scorsese's biopic ""The Aviator"" does a powerful job portraying the eccentric life of Howard Hughes and his love of aviation, his obsession with women and film and his ability to take risks. <br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is believable as Hughes. We have watched DiCaprio mature before our eyes from ""Titanic"" to ""Gangs of New York"" to ""Catch Me if You Can"" to the young Hughes. He is so good that sooner or later he will win the Oscar. Hopefully it will be this time!<br/><br/>One of the best things about seeing a historical figure on the big screen is we learn things we never knew. Katharine Hepburn falls for the dashing, powerful, handsome and rich Hughes. If bored at a party, Hughes would take his date for a late night plane ride over Hollywood. We can understand Hepburn better after seeing her tumultuous life with Hughes and then falling for Spencer Tracy who was calm and steadying. You must find out what Hughes does to protect his old flame. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn is worth the price of your ticket. She recreates Hepburn from the staccato voice to her aristocratic walk. <br/><br/>The film accurately shows Hughes's struggle with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder that manifested in his incessant washing of hands, his fear of germs and his withdraw from life in his later years. Today, those suffering can receive treatment, unlike Hughes who did not. <br/><br/>Not all moviegoers will appreciate the details of building his planes and some will be bored with too much time spent on the scenes of his early film, Hell's Angels. As the owner of TWA, Hughes took on Congress and the powerful Pan Am to hone in on the overseas monopoly. Who knows where aviation would be if not for the vision and daring of Hughes, including a fiery plane crash. This Must See film is at the top of my list for Best Picture and Best Actor.<br/><br/>Film Critic<br/><br/>Jennifer@JerseyShoreJournal.com"

","Martin Scorsese's masterfully directed film ranks up with his best films such as GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, and Mean Streets. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a much better performance than he did in Gangs of New York, that film was all about Daniel Day-Lewis. Cate Blanchett gives her usual Oscar worthy performance as an excellent Katherine Hepburn. The film was also filled with smaller performances from such great as Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, John C. Reilly, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, and Jude Law. Any true Scorsese fan will be blown away by this wonderful film. I can only hope the Academy looks past Jamie Foxx's very good performance in Ray and vote for Di Caprio's excellent performance in The Aviator."
"sycul","6","1","2","21 February 2005"," Interesting story, but too long and rather dull
","A story about a rich guy, who invests all his money in flight, and fights his way among politicians and competitors. Interesting story, with full of animation and emotions, but too long and rather dull. It's not a love story, neither a drama, nor an adventure. It wants to be everything and comes to be nothing. I've been expecting a much more better movie from Scorsese, however I think the problem lies in the script. DiCaprio brings an excellent performance, but all the other talented and illustrious actors are just puppets on the stage. Recommendation: If you don't have anything else to do, you can watch it. Otherwise it's not worth giving money for it."
"turorudi888","3","1","2","20 February 2005"," Boring
","Several Oscar nominees for that film? Scorses or Di Caprio must have good connections in the jury... To be honest, it's one the most boring and most dull films I've ever seen. After seeing it I questioned myself: what was it all about? Was this about a pscyhopatic man or a good businessman or what? O yeah I understand, it was about a man who we know nothing about, and it's a story of a man that leaves only questions behind. But the problem is: who the hell does care about who this man was? Scorsese didn't even touch my attention. The storyline can be described like this: Hughes has done this, Hughes has done that, Hughes was here and went there and he had famous girlfriends There was a time when he was a totally freak but after that period everything's fine again. At the end you see no real story, there is no real drama, there isn't anything. And this took 170 minutes. Di Caprios acting is absolutely middle-class. I really can't feel the madness of Hughes, there is no depth in the character. And besides that, I had the impression that this is a 16 year old boy and not a 40 year old man. Di Caprio looks like a 16 year old child...oh excuse me, his voice is just 14 years old. They shouldn't let him play old characters, it's too funny:)"
"noizyme","7","1","2","20 February 2005"," Biopic for those who don't know Hughes' story ends up just OK
","Howard Hughes had a pretty crazy life. That's what I could sum up this biopic as trying to say. There was no reason to release this film at this time, but Scorsese did a pretty decent job, and therefore, the directing saved this pretty anti-climactic story There were hardly any resolutions when Hughes, played very consistently by Leonardo DiCaprio, would see a problem with his insanities throughout life, which made his story seem less and less likely to end up great. In fact, a lot of friends I know thought this was suppose to show the genius behind him, but in actuality, the film seems to make him more like an OCD sufferer and man who cheats death throughout his life rather than any kind of public-figure-turned-hero/genius.<br/><br/>All of the acting was done very well. I got tired of seeing Cate Blanchett's ""Katherine Hepburn,"" but I guess I should blame Scorsese for allowing that over-the-top delivery over and over again. Gwen Stefani played Jean Harlow, who seems to never say much other than kissing some Hughes butt publicly (at least that's what you think whenever you see her role in The Aviator). Hughes, being a man of the ladies of Hollywood, knew and dated many a celebrity back in his time, and this film got that fact across, and he probably would've continued had his drive to work more than love taken over.<br/><br/>The film completely overlooks his death and some other points of his life, but again, Scorsese sums up a good amount of it. The film was a bit long (about a man whom some have never heard of before) to get it point across, but it was nice to hear that some of past's moguls were not so boring and that they had their problems, too.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'd see it again, but it was a great summing up of Hughes' life. I gave it a 7/10 because it had a pretty typical story of a man's rise and fall throughout life, but it was nice to see the many facets of humanity that were realized before Hughes' eyes when he was at the height of his career. A good rent, when it comes out, but I wouldn't buy."
"superdavein78","9","1","2","19 February 2005"," He did it his way
","Hughes did it all HIS way and look where it got him. Leo, in his best performance since Gilbert Grape, does a great job of recreating one of America's great whack jobs when he was in his prime. In Martin Scorcese's best film in more than 2 decades the fast times and tragedy are recreated amazingly well. A sure fire choice for best picture. And another note--Cate Blanchet is amazing as Kate Hepburn, under Marty's steady eye she never steals the movie but more than shows her worth. Right in the center of the film is a moment in film I will never forget. That epic one-man plane crash is one of the most stunning sights I've ever seen on film."
"Figgiedan","9","1","2","10 February 2005"," It's a talkie!
","A great night out at the movies. Leonardo and Scorcese are a great combo, different from the Deniro-Scorcese combo, but just as strong and a dynamic-duo all the same. They seem to be more of a positive combo than the dark films Scorcese made with DeNiro. ""Aviator"" is Scorcese's most ""Hollywood"" movie since ""Cape Fear"" and is about 100 times better. One thing about Scorcese is you can tell he is passionate about his subjects. Howard Hughes is a real ""American dream"" and has a rise and fall and rise again story that everyone loves to hear about. All of the actors are great. Blanchett is annoying but only because she does Hepburn so well (Hepburn was, to me, annoying, but also endearing). Leo DiCaprio is great as Hughes. Alda and Baldwin add to the mix. It was really just a very entertaining film, one of my favorites of the year and a pleasant surprise. It really made me more interested about Howard Hughes, how he literally lived every day like it was his last and what it cost him along the way. 9 out of 10. A-. In my top five this year."

I can't stand him. He has a hard time playing older characters on film --- he never seems old. Granted if I was in his place I would take that as a compliment but he can't transform like Cate Blanchett. She played Katharine Hepburn like a fiddle. In fact the best parts of the movie focused on their relationship.<br/><br/>It is hard to separate someone's incredible life from a movie depiction of it. I feel that H.H. life was far more interesting in real life (and more complex) than anything that could be put on the screen.

"cultfilmfan","8","1","2","7 February 2005"," The Aviator
","The Aviator, is based on the true life story of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes, was very eccentric and he directed such films as Hell's Angels and Scarface. Howard, had a lot of money so he founded his own aircraft company where he would design and build aircrafts. He even broke a couple of speed records with some of his aircrafts. Howard, also dated a lot of women including actress Katharine Hepburn, and later in his life he lived mostly in a hotel room running his business from there. The Aviator, has good direction, a good script, good performances by everyone involved (especially Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Howard Hughes), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costume design. The film is made by director Martin Scorsese, who I like very much as a filmmaker but I wasn't very impressed with his last film Gangs Of New York. Martin Scorsese, makes up for that film with this one. The Aviator, is entertaining, well made, is very good visually, is interesting, compelling, Leonardo DiCaprio gives an Oscar worth performance, the film is enthralling, the film is stylish, a good character study, gives us another Oscar worthy performance by Cate Blanchett who plays Katharine Hepburn and is just a very compelling and excellently made film from it's acting down to it's in detail production design. I would have liked to have known a little bit more facts about Howard Hughes, and his life but that is only a small complaint and I was very pleased with the rest of this film. A great film and one of the year's best."

","I made the mistake to read only American reviews before seeing the movie. I would have avoided the film. European reviews draw a different picture of it. The reason is simple: The movie assumes a lot of knowledge about the subject and American zeitgeist. You need to catch some keywords and names, and you need to recognise their meaning and produce the associated American emotions. If you cannot you will see a long and confusing film. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the movie is bad. I am just saying non-Americans have a harder time understanding and thus enjoying it. However, if you want to get a glimpse of how the entrepreneurial spirit of our brothers and sisters on the other side of the Atlantic has evolved this film might be for you."

The special effects were spectacular, the soundtrack flawless, and the acting surprisingly great. Everything about this movie flowed so nicely. Howard Hughes himself was so over-the-top, so the movie could glide smoothly through the story of his life without having to over-dramatize anything. Classy film-making here; kind of a like a new version of Citizen Kane... It'd be awfully lame if someone made a new version of Citizen Kane, so this is the closest you can get to having a new epic story like that. Also kudos to DiCaprio on his acting job.

It was too redundant- flash bulbs- flashy '20 Hollywood. It would have been more interesting to have some element of focus on more of what exactly contributed/inspired Hughes as an aeronautical genius and movie mogul.

The aviator is well made, Scorses doesn't make any mistake (maybe too long) but it's such a very cold film. The character of Howard Hugues is great to make a film but in the end I didn't mind what happened to this man. The Academy must pay the debt with Socrses and it seems Scorses made the film just to win the Oscar. As for the actors, they are not bad even if I can't stand Cate Blanchett's affectation playing Katharine Hepburn. Leonardo Di Caprio is not bad even if he doesn't look like Howard Hugues and he seems young during the whole film. Consequently I think it's a well made boring film."

I don't know what Scorcese was thinking...why did it have to be 3 f**king hours long!!! I wanted to vomit all over myself. The fact that he had to rely on cheap computer graphics made the whole film seem cheesy and fake. This only confirms my theory that Scorcese has outlived his glory days, and will spend the rest of his film-making days trying to make epic over-inflated, under inspired pictures that fall horribly short. Even as a fan of aviation I was not very interested in watching the movie because I was so disgusted. I thought the urine in the milk bottles was a bit funny though."

Leonardo DiCaprio has a way of surprising me. When I think: O my God - not another film ruined by this teen-idol! it actually comes out as a great movie. He sure is a talented actor. <br/><br/>But both prominent Hollywood figures did let me down this weekend. This weekend I saw The Aviator. It wasn't a bad film, not at all. The story is interesting and the acting is very well in some parts. Not to mention: John C. Reilly is playing (as always) a great role. But The Aviator never leaves a mediocre level - it's predictable, it babbles on never really being exciting in any way. The trailer makes us believe that it will be the epic we've always been waiting for. But it isn't at all. It is just a film about a tragic figure and a world that doesn't understand him. That intriguing fact is overlooked by the cinematographic violence and outdated visual effects, so the real tragedy never becomes really visible. For that reason I do not understand all the laudatory criticism - it could've been a brilliant movie if Scorsese had let this habit to overreact at home. The movie wants to be epic full of visual effects and a personal tragedy at the same time and it doesn't work out!

","I was not very familiar with Howard Hughes. I knew he had made a few movies (never saw any of them, though) and built planes that never flew, but mainly I thought of him as the eccentric recluse of his later years. Now this film shows a totally different character, a man with a vision. And what a vision! HH could so easily have become another spoiled rich kid, bedding starlets, getting drunk and doped up and dying never having done anything besides spending millions seeking vain private pleasures. Instead, the film shows us a frantic movie maker, giving it all for his art, and an even more frantic aviator and airplane builder, to whom a few million dollars are insignificant when they are needed to make his dreams come true. Of course, it's easy to be a big spender when you are swimming in money, and I couldn't see any sign of HH having any social conscience in an era where so many of his countrymen were starving, but at least he used his fortune to create things he believed in. Grandiose things, crazy, fascinating things. But why did he do it? The film never tells us what made HH do all those things he did. First we see him as a kid being washed by his mother, which is probably supposed to explain his future phobia, but then we see him in the middle of shooting Hell's angels and next as a daredevil aviator. How did he get there? Why did he become such an obsessed movie maker (it made me think of Orson Welles, equally obsessed but without the money to follow through on his grand schemes)? And why did he want so much to build the perfect plane? The film could easily have addressed these questions. It certainly was long enough. Unnecessarily so in a number of scenes, I find (although I wouldn't have minded if some other, brilliantly shot scenes would have been longer). By cutting more rigorously, much more could have been covered in those 3 hours.<br/><br/>Enough has already been said about the very good acting. Still, I like to complement Leonardo DiCaprio on his transformation from the young jeune premier to the mature businessman appearing before the committee. He is much more convincing than James Dean attempting the same transformation (and also sporting a mustache when older) in Giant. Unfortunately, I was less thrilled by his naked lunatic scenes, which were mainly embarrassing to watch."

I also very much enjoyed the interaction between Howard and some of the women in his life, like Kathern Hepburn.

Cate manages to portray Kate as bold, self-assured, biting, and vulnerable all at once, and you may not believe this is the same woman who has played both Elizabeth and Galadriel.<br/><br/>Then, we need to talk about what's good about this movie, which is most of other actor/actress in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio manages to be both charming and frightening, and Alec Baldwin has mastered the art of playing the well-mannered sleaze-bag.<br/><br/>Finally, we need to talk about what's wrong with the movie: where and how it ends. Without giving too much away, let me just say that when the credits started rolling, they came at a very awkward point and left far too many questions unanswered. Scorsese should have either ended it sooner or gone ahead and let the other shoe drop.<br/><br/>This movie will get a lot of mention for Best Picture awards, but before those envelopes are opened, I'd like to see the rest of the picture first."

","Many moviegoers bemoan Woody Allen's work of the last 15 years as being a shadow of his former self. But late Scorsese work is not a pretty thing either. Gangs of New York was a self-impressed bouquet of flowers to the dimmest of male viewers. Age of Innocence was glacial and uneventful. Shutter Island was Scorsese's limp contribution to the twist-ending genre. Aviator (like GoNY) proves that Scorsese continues to take interesting story ideas (here, the rise and fall of oddball Howard Hughes) and turn them into flat, superficial projects. The movie has a script that might've been written by-a-machine. The author is working in shallow mode. The excessive winks at the audience are tiresome. (Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, Rufus Wainwright as a big band singer) DiCaprio is again amateurish and wrong for the role. He cannot play a character of any complexity; also miscast are both Blanchet as Hepburn, and someone else (?) as Ava Gardner. Another character mispronounces the name of Theda Bara because she's just some nobody mired the past. Blanchet looks like the only cast member who appears to be older than 19. And the acting is straight out of a high school play. Inexplicably, this won an Oscar for it's exceptionally cheap-looking cinematography. There is nothing to discover in this movie, because nothing is hidden. <br/><br/>Scorsese is at least as shallow as Michael Bay.

The chutzpah of the makers in omitting huge chunks of the Hughes' story and the host of interesting and historical characters who impinged on Hughes' life, whilst embellishing relatively minor incidents is little short of breathtaking. The casting of the baby-faced DiCaprio as the central character is laughable - at no time does he even come close to close to capturing the essence of a man who was a giant of his times. About the only good thing that can be said about this film is that the few flying scenes are well done.

The cast, generally speaking, is excellent. The production values and art direction are extremely high. The script, in a word, stinks. This movie should have never been made. First of all, this film deals with only a small part of Howard Hughes' life. It seems fragmented and disjointed. There is no ""beginning"" to the story, we're just thrown into his life in the late 1920's and not given any background as to who this is and where he's from. The movie ends pretty much the same way. As what apparently is not said anymore in the movie business, what's the motivation? There doesn't seem to be any. We are treated to a somewhat clinical observation of a multi-millionaire and his various psychological exploits. This makes the character flat and a non-person. Some of the other characters such as Katherine Hepburn are given the same consideration. They are merely names and dates in history without personalities and depth. Is this what Mr. Scorsese actually intended? Is he tearing down these people or is he actually not aware of what was happening? On some level it could appear that he has a personal grudge against Howard Hughes and most of the rest of the characters because he doesn't bring out any dimension or humanity in these people. That's for minds more qualified than mine in psychology to delve into. I'm only writing my opinion about what I saw. Dramatic presentations about historical events and people are never accurate and so don't go into this film expecting the absolute truth. As is usual, they got the names and dates right but not the story. Howard Hughes was extremely complex, not normal by societal convention, and much more than just a megalomaniac womanizer as portrayed here by the inept, incredulous performance of DiCaprio. Rent this if you have the time to waste."
"bchaskins","3","2","7","22 January 2005"," Too much swearing
","I did not enjoy this movie, and in fact walked out part way through due to the large amount of swearing and the use of God's names. This was unnecessary and spoiled the picture. There was also too much time spent on Hughes' social life and not enough on Aviation( the main reason for going to the movie was an interest in the aviation aspects of Howard Hughes) Others who left at the same time commented that they were leaving for the same reasons. The movie left much to be desired. Thank you. Please note that it is too hard to write a minimum of 10 lines, surely a pithy comment of 4-5 lines should give a reasonable picture of my feelings about a movie."
"bale98","10","2","7","26 December 2004"," DiCaprio was excellent
","I am a 44 year old male movie buff and not necessarily a Leo fan--I liked ""Titanic"" and ""Catch me if you can"" but not much else. I have been a Howard Hughes fan for years and I liked a previous TV movie on his life. The Movie trailers were what sold me to see the movie. <br/><br/>I thought DiCaprio was credible as Hughes and he did a good job keeping me interested in the three hour epic. That is what I go to see movies for and He did his job in making me believe he was Hughes. I also think he should get an Oscar nod and hope to see more of this kind of acting from him in the future.<br/><br/>So, IMHO it was a very credible movie from a talented actor that made me want to see more of his work. I am not a female, nor gay and I am way too old to be a groupie. See this movie if you like to be entertained."

","I cannot say enough good things about this film. It is wonderfully acted and the direction is top notch. Dicaprio does an excellent job in his portrayal of Howard Hughes and Cate Blanchett is truly perfect casting as Catherine Hepburn. The photography is so reminiscent of the old techni-color films and lends so much to the time you almost get swept up in the film which is written so well. It is quite long but really truly worth it. If you love old Hollywood run out and see it you will LOVE it! The flight scenes as so beautiful and so well crafted that I want to see Scorsese do something else relating to flight to see what else he can do. This really should win him his first Best Director Oscar and achievement is well deserved."

","Saw this film last night at Loews, Cherry Hill, NJ. Up to the scene in which Howard and Kate go to visit her parents, the color of film was appalling. Everything was blue and rust, no green. In the scene with Errol Flynn and the peas lined up on the plate, they were little blue balls, why? Didn't Howard Hughes have dark eyes? Why, oh why wasn't the color of Leo's eyes changed to reflect this and make the portrayal more realistic? I found these little things very distracting, did I hear some say, ""obessive compulsive? Thought his performance was outstanding but the film as a whole with all advance hep, the let me down, big time. Although a long film, time went fast."

","I found this movie to be absolutely captivating. It provided me with so much information about a man whom I had only heard of. If a movie prompts me to do research about a particular topic when I come home, it has opened my mind and my world up to something new. I found there to be so much very interesting information on Howard Hughes. What a strangely deep man he was. This movie took me for a ride that has made a lasting impression on me. Houston, TX is a very short drive from where I live and I will be sure to visit his grave sight the next time I am there. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, this performance has proved his talent as a very engaging and maturing actor. He has come a long way and I hope he will finally be recognized by the Academy for his work on this film. Both in front of and behind the camera. I will definitely purchase the DVD as it becomes available to add to my personal collection."

","Wondered if DiCaprio could pull off a dark, complex role ? Wondered if Scorcese would pull back from the excess and cant which almost ruined ""Gangs of New York"" ? Wondered if Howard Hughes-rake,megalomaniac and robber baron-could be made to be interesting or compelling ? Well I wondered on all 3 counts before seeing the Aviator, and am pleased to report the answer is yes on all 3 counts. It's not a perfect picture, partly because Scorcese wants to provide a big sweep: huge sets with hundreds of extras, huge ""production values"". They're fun, provide lots of useful clips for the trailer but don't add much the story. There are a few characters who make an appearance for no particular purpose such as Jude Law playing Errol Flynn. The film is at its best when it hews to its main character. At the end of the day the movie is about the inner demons of Howard Hughes, and everything else is just (very watchable) froth."

","Master filmmaker Martin Scorsese delivers another movie masterpiece with this astoundingly well-made epic about the life of Hollywood mogul/aviation pioneer Howard Hughes. Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent in the role of Hughes, proving once again that he's one of the finest actors of his generation.<br/><br/>The movie covers twenty years in Hughes' life, spanning his relationships with Hollywood stars like Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), his battle with Pan Am executive Juan Trippe and the Senator under his control, and his greatest struggle with his own germaphobic/obsessive compulsive fears. Scorsese uses lighting, cinematography, period music, and so much else with such vigor and life in every frame that is rarely felt during any other film. He is truly a master of his craft, and although ""The Aviator"" is not a perfect movie, it comes closer than almost any movie of this year. For anyone who wants to experience the joy of movies, this is one flight you'll have to catch."

","I saw The Aviator last night and was amazed at how well it was done. I've seen (and have on DVD) quite a number of Leonardo DiCaprio movies but would have to say this was his best (to date). As well, Cate Blanchett as Kathrine Hepburn...if she doesn't win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress I'll be disappointed. Cate was excellent as Kate! <br/><br/>This was a very well done movie. The cinematography was fantastic as were the costumes and sets. I can't wait for this to be released on DVD and will be first in line to buy it! <br/><br/>A lot of period movies, fact or fiction, always throw in a new song by a present-day artist.

When I watched this one on DVD, I was impressed with the overall excellence of this film, not just her performance (which was superb). Every aspect of this production is excellent. Disc 2 in particular provides details about the depth of rigour and preparation behind the scenes. The historical accuracy of Howard Hughes biographical is deep, especially DiCaprio's preparation for the portrayal of the downward spiral of OCD. I'm of the age that followed Hugh's news events from the 1940s until his death. I appreciate how this film puts it into a human perspective. Movie making at its finest with great authenticity!"
"gvapsol","9","1","3","8 June 2014"," Almost a masterpiece!!!
","This film by Martin Scorsese is a biopic about Howard Hughes, a man well known for his passion about movies and aviation. He is portrayed by Leonardo Di Caprio.<br/><br/>This is a classic theme for Scorsese, the rise and fall of the man. This one begins showing the story behind Hughes' germ phobia. After that, a grown Hughes tries to surpass all the obstacles, in order to finish an epic project. When this happens, he becomes immediately a celebrity. After that, he turns to his big love, aviation. Now famous and wealthy, he tries to innovate in this section. While this happens, his personal life becomes a mess and he makes powerful enemies. This is when he starts losing his mind.<br/><br/>First of all, the cast and the acting were superb. Each one of the actors was perfect for his role, Jude Law made a great appearance, Cate Blanchett was really good (she won an Oscar for this performance) and of course Di Caprio, even though I felt like he exaggerated sometimes. There were great performances by other supporting actors too, like John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin and Adam Scott.<br/><br/>I loved the soundtrack as well, this calming and happy music which brought me into the mood of the movie.<br/><br/>The direction was perfect. I've seen lots of Scorsese's movies, but this one was something else. Maybe it was the incredible visual effects and the wonderful colors that made it so good watching.<br/><br/>Some personal thoughts are that I don't know if Cate Blanchett and Jude Law portrayed their characters well, because I haven't seen any of their movies (yet). Also, I am tired of Di Caprio always playing the leading man in almost every movie of his (catch me if you can, inception, wolf of wall street and others). <br/><br/>To sum up, it was a great movie, an epic film and very close to be a masterpiece. I give it 9/10."

"PartialMovieViewer","10","1","3","16 April 2014"," Very Award Worthy
","Why has this guy not won an Academy Award yet? Next to Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, nobody-but-nobody can top the acting talent of Mr. DiCaprio. This man is the real deal. Grantedmany of his movies are squishy tearjerkers and I wouldn't give them a second look. But this flick – yes - this flick is so fantastic. And there is no freaking way anyone else could have played the lead. I have to say, I am so sorry I did not see this in the theater – this is smart desert of classy entertainment topped off with a frosting of explosive emotion. I laughed, I cried, I cried and I cried-and-laughed at the same time. The emotions were uncontrollable. Excuse meI have to wipe a tear from my eye. Ah – that's better. I don't think Mr. Scorsese has ever produced a dog, I believe everything he touches is gold. This movie is definitely not any different. Mixing a fine cast, with superb lighting, scenery, stuntsand all that other crap that goes into making a movie – and then to have masterpiece after masterpiece turn out, that really takes some talent to have such success. You can also tell that the story of Howard Hughes was painstakingly researched and treated even-handedly. I thoroughly enjoyed the script. There were so many parts that were noteworthy, but one particular incident does paint a huge grin in my mind. 'Spoiler Alert' While dining with the wealthy Hepburn Clan, Hughes is lambasted about greed and wealth, by some ascot-wearing snot. This Marxist marionette brags to Howard that, 'They (The oh-so Socialists/Communists Hepburns) are not interested in money.' Bah! What a joke. As soon as that doo-doo brain opened his narcissistic head-toilet, I would have immediately left. I probably would have done some other stuffbut let's not get into that. Besides, this is not my story but Hugh's and Leonardo's character did not do what I would have done. Instead he remained silent, appearing to quietly acquiesce to all this verbal excrement, (but – shhhhh - in reality he was patiently waiting for his opportunity to strike.) Our hero (Howard) digested enough snarkyness and, without warning, he strikes like an angry viper. He skillfully and somewhat forcefully, took command of the entire dinner conversation. Granted, it was more than obvious that the cowl of ignorance would never be lifted from the eyes of the moronic, but that did not stop the H. H. Smack-down. Howard informed his Lobster-Head-Sucking Socialist dining partners that, 'love of money' is easy to scoff at, if one already has wealth (kind of like the Hepburns). After that scene – I am now a super-fan. When I see movies venture beyond the Hollywood Fantasy Land of Lies and venture into the painful world of fact – that is when I can truly appreciate them. I am a little surprised that this kind of retort did not get edited out. My opinion only; it was probably an honest view of the world seared into the brains of those bred into wealthy situations. On that same note – it is sad that so many performers use their platform of notoriety to pontificate ignorance, basing their conclusions on obscured observations. Anyways – this is an excellent movie – I give all aspects a standing ovation."
"RossRivero99","10","1","3","15 April 2014"," One of 2004's best films
","Martin Scorsese's historically accurate drama about the life about Howard Hughes' career from the late 1920's to the mid 1940's is to me nothing short of great. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes who at the time of his life was the richest man in the world had many different jobs such as a film producer, plane designer, aviator, and pilot. DiCaprio plays Hughes perfectly in this well done biopic. Director Martin Scorsese knows history movie accuracy and not only the movie had a great camera crew and cast. But the movie showed us who Howard Hughes really was. The movie also has great work from Cate Blanchett, John C. Reilly, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, and the legendary Alan Alda.This movie sort of reminds me of Flight which was directed by Robert Zemeckis, But Martin Scorsese's The Aviator was much better in my opinion. Also the movie has great costume design, art direction, and especially great photography from the magnificent Robert Richardson."

","The Aviator is another Martin Scorsese's movie confirming his genius and unique character in film industry. His movies always has an intricate plot, the cast always consists of great actors and the scenarios are also magnificent reflecting with all details the epoch where the story takes place. All this together makes his films be watched, remembered and talked about.<br/><br/>The Aviator is a story about Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio), American millionaire, inventor and director. Since his childhood he was passionate about movies and aviation. So, his first movie Hell's Angels was about planes. Its production lasted for several years. During these years Hughes spent a lot of money and efforts on finishing this film. Nevertheless, the final result was amazing, the movie was very successful. Then Hughes made some more films, but at the end decided to dedicate himself to aviation. He also had different love affairs that ended tragically. Howard Hughes is rich, successful, but he, like many other mortals, has his own skeletons. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that gets worse and worse as Hughes grows and reaches new victories. And it's interesting to watch how he deals with this problem: being such a genius and paranoid at the same time and achieve his goals. I guess Leo's character totally proves that no matter what, but he will get what he really wants. By the way, I should point out DiCaprio's brilliant actor performance. He is really great and talented actor. I can't imagine any other person who could present his character how Leo did that! I just don't understand why he doesn't have any Oskar yet.<br/><br/>The Aviator is a movie I would recommend to those people who appreciate film craft and Martin Scorsese's production. I don't mean other audience can't watch it. Everybody is advised to see it. You will enjoy this movie, its story, actors' performance, decorations and the way it was made."
"JohnRayPeterson","9","1","3","6 February 2012"," Well worth watching; Hughes was a fascinating man, the Steve Jobs of his time.
","The movie is lengthy, two hours and fifty minutes; it is however the time needed to cover the Howard Hughes life's highlights, and the time necessary to develop the character, specially the portrayal of his mental illness in the context of the events of his life. He was as important in his time and has contributed much to our modern society. He was a visionary; that aspect is always a topic worth putting on film as it is in books.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is known not to hold back; he will research a story in great details and will spare no cost to cover that in the films he makes. He surprised me, in 2004, when he picked Leonardo DiCaprio to play the leading role; the age of his leading man seemed a bit of a stretch, but that was due in part to my misperception, because he looked younger at 30 then, than most of us do. I had that prejudice when I first watched it, but I did anyway and even did a second time when I got the DVD. As many of us purchased big wide screen TVs in recent years, revisiting the movies we have in our collection seems like the thing to do; why bother buying them if not to watch them again. Well, the cinematography is superb and I'm glad I revisited this flick. DiCaprio is an outstanding actor; he has played, in the last decade at least, many excellent characters with all the intensity and credibility one could hope for. I've seen them all and always look forward to the next. In passing, I like that we don't hear about his personal life and that he does not do promo interviews; great actors just don't and that does not distract us from their performances.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, if one can say Cate Blanchett has a supporting role (more like co-star), includes many big names and they all did superbly. Go over that list, you'll see what I mean. I have read many great reviews from other users, as well as some sour ones from people whose taste I question. I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough; I even would suggest it would be pleasant to watch again despite being a 2004 movie."

"pfgpowell-1","4","1","3","30 May 2009"," Nicely filmed biopic and a tad disappointing. Where's the drama?
","I wouldn't be at all surprised that in some of the more liberal US states it is a capital offence to criticise Martin Scorsese. I mean, surely if is one of God's truths that he makes fine movies and couldn't make a dud if he tried? Well, unfortunately for all its fine acting, high value production, soundtrack, atmosphere and, not least, special effects, with The Aviator Marty is, in this man's humble opinion, skating on rather thin ice. One of the many questions which presented themselves to me and which wouldn't go away was: what was the point of The Aviator? It isn't a drama, we already know the story of Howard Hughes's life, there are, apparently, no great revelations, it is not a left-field re-interpretation, in fact, at the end of the day it is simply just another, although extremely well-made biopic. So why was it made? More than that, it is also a tad confusing. Purporting to show Hughes' life between the early Thirties and the late Forties, it apparently takes some liberties with chronology. It also takes quite a few liberties with the facts: why, for example, the emphasis on Katherine Hepburn (with whom he lived) when by all accounts she was just one of several hundred of his sexual conquests? And why was not mention made of the fact that Hughes' bi-sexuality was also no secrets. He wasn't just seducing many of the starlets but also many of the stars. The Aviator also seems - and I must emphasise that word 'seems' - rather badly put together. No doubt Scorsese shot far more film than he needed and tried to shape his movie in the cutting room. Unfortunately, that means there are too many loose ends and quite a few mystifying cameos. Willem Dafoe appears briefly as, I think, a journalist, and is then never seen or alluded to again. Was his part bigger in the script, but cut later on? Who knows? Many other promising characters are introduced, never to appear again. There's Errol Flynn (having a fight), reputedly another of Hughes's sexual conquest, Spencer Tracy makes a brief, and very oblique appearance. There is something curiously two-dimensional about The Aviator, largely because it lacks any kind of drama and because the details of Hughes's life are already well-known. So why did Scorsese make this film. I don't know. Finally, Leonard Di Caprio plays a blinder, and in the later scenes bears an uncanny resemblance to the real Hughes. Unfortunately, this viewer could not once suspend disbelief: it was always Di Caprio up there on the screen acting well. Which is not really that good a thing. Two cheers for Scorsese's effort. Elsewhere this is called a masterpiece and a great American tragedy. No, it's not. Sorry. For that you'll have to look elsewhere."
"ShootingShark","5","1","3","26 April 2008"," Lavish, Impeccably-Styled But Unexceptional Howard Hughes Biopic
","Wealthy young industrialist Howard Hughes is a brilliant aeronautics engineer, a record-breaking pilot and a maverick independent movie producer with a string of famous lady friends. He may be the richest man in the world and seems to have it all, but happiness is ever elusive, there are powerful political forces opposing him, and he has an obsession with hygiene which threatens to crack his psyche ... <br/><br/>The unique Howard Hughes has been portrayed on screen several times - my favourite is Dean Stockwell in Tucker: The Man And His Dream - but this is the major treatment; an epic blockbuster Hollywood extravaganza with all the trimmings. Like all such movies it has good points and bad points - the period sets and costumes, the photography and the lavish visuals are wonderful, but it crams in so many events from Hughes' extraordinary life that it lacks atmosphere and focus, and whilst DiCaprio is fast-talking and intense he doesn't really give us much idea who the great man really was. Blanchett steals the show as Katharine Hepburn, nailing her upper-class Yankee accent perfectly and exposing both her brittle humour and her vulnerability, and there are enjoyable cameos from singer Gwen Stefani (as Jean Harlow), Jude Law (as Errol Flynn) and Scorsese alumni Dafoe as a slimy gossip columnist. There are also some great scenes; a romantic night-flight over Beverly Hills, a funny meeting with the censorship board, Hughes chewing out Hepburn's cronies at the dinner table, and an eye-popping plane crash into a pretty suburb. But we don't really learn that much about Howard aside from some basic stuff - he was rich, he was a bit deaf and he went loopy sometimes. When Hepburn breaks up with him we don't see how, or even if it really affected him, we're just onto the next amazing scene. And as with all biopics it leaves key things out; it's set between the late twenties and the late forties, but doesn't mention his first wife, Ella Rice, his addiction to painkillers, his purchase (and dissolution) of RKO Pictures, and deliberately finishes on a high note (his victory in the Congressional hearing against him and the Hercules flight) thereby leaving out his infamously bizarre and reclusive later years. A five-time Oscar-winner (AMPAS loves movies like this) and an enjoyably grandiose biopic (produced by Michael Mann), but not really one of Scorsese's best films. Not to be confused with the 1985 Christopher Reeve / Rosanna Arquette film of the same name."

"tharnax","7","1","3","6 April 2007"," Scorsese Illuminates Hughes' Enigma, Dicaprio Grows...
","This 2004 Howard Hughes biopic stands out amongst the best biographical pictures of the last 10 years. Although not as gritty and intense as Scorsese's greatest film ""Raging Bull"" (1980), this picture is well-crafted and sleek. The life and times of the enigmatic Howard Hughes make for compelling subject matter and Socorsese's effort does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Those of us Scorsese fans that look upon his work as commercially defiant, and nuanced towards sophisticated viewers have witnessed a gradual, relentless modifying of his technique toward a wider demographic. This evolution of Scorcese's once radical film-making style towards a more commercial, big budget approach is natural and expected given the increasing commercial success of each successive Scorsese film, (not to mention major studio desire to release the next potential Scorsese classic i.e. ""GoodFellas""). These changes in style and presentation are also closely linked to the diverse screenplays and proliferation of new A-list talent (such as Mr. DiCaprio) headlining Scorsese's pictures. Given these considerations, ""The Aviator"" still manages to showcase quite a few original Scorsese sequences recalling his raw and intensely personal early films.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes was a filmmaker as well as an aviator and it's no surprise that the chaotic production of Hughes first film ,1930's ""Hell's Angels"" (which Scorsese clearly admires) is chronicled in detail at the outset of the movie. We witness the continuous nervous energy and persistent drive of Hughes to achieve his daring goals, all the while breaking new ground in aviation, film and big business. This film closely tracks Hughes' personal life as well, his well-publicized affairs with famous starlets of the day such as Katherine Hepburn (played well by Cate Blanchett) are illustrated in-depth with notable performances throughout.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio continues to grow and develop under Scorsese's direction, and the development is phenomenal to witness. Beginning with ""Gangs Of New York"" (2002) and continuing beyond this movie (2006's masterful ""The Departed""), DiCaprio's acting chops are sharpening with each performance, eclipsing his previous work and establishing his talent amongst Hollywood's A-List actors. As the Hughes character, DiCaprio is able to captivate and compel us with flashes of OCD symptoms and manic behavior to the extreme, all the while struggling to balance these chaotic forces with his public and managerial personas. A fascinating example of this balancing act occurs when Hughes is confronted with a ruthless public relations attack, designed to coerce him into selling his airline TWA to his commercial competitor, Pan Am (whose chief, Juan Trippe is played by Alec Baldwin). Hughes collects his faculties and battles back with impressive vigor, this after nearly dying in a spectacular crash of his XF-11 spy plane prototype. All of these events unfold beautifully and the rhythm of this film holds our attention despite the nearly 3 hour running time.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" holds up well on repeat viewings despite the long running time, it covers the entire first half of Hughe's remarkable life and career, and a second feature could easily be written detailing Hughes' subsequent years in Las Vegas and his premature death. All in all, DiCaprio's growth as an actor cannot be understated, this is a must see performance."
"Pam468","3","1","3","23 March 2007"," Just really boring..........
","I was shocked at how long & drawn out this movie was. After 1 and a half hours in, both my daughter and myself had had enough. I was hoping for a glimpse of Hollywood's ""Golden Years"" and characterizations of famous stars. Other than Cait Blanchett as Kate Hepburn - who literally made the movie for me, she was so amazing - the rest of the movie fell very flat. Leo's scowl throughout most of the movie became very annoying and the constant references to airplanes - I know, the movie was about aviation - just wasn't interesting enough to sustain a movie of that length. I felt that Leo was a thin caricature of Howard Hughes - and his descent into madness was not a convincing portrayal."
"tearskeepafalling","4","1","3","24 November 2006"," The life story of Howard Hughes, an eccentric but incredibly talented and dedicated man.
","Before I saw this movie I had never heard of Howard Hughes. I am now completely fascinated by the man. Unfortunately, the movie itself was not particularly impressive. <br/><br/>Acting: DiCaprio's character was good and I think deeper and more developed than most roles he chooses (a certain Shakespearean movie comes to mind,) but a bit too reminiscent of Johnny Depp's Ed Wood for my personal tastes. However as I am strongly convinced that originality is much dead, so it didn't bother me too much. I thought Blanchett's character was brilliant in the beginning, but she dropped a lot of mannerisms she brought out of her character in one of her first scenes as the movie progressed, which was disappointing. Most of the other acting was passable if not well done. However (harsh, I know) TV actors with quasi-permanent roles should never switch to movies, because they have associated themselves with a certain person and their face no longer has the needed anonymity for any role. *coEdwardHerrmannugh*<br/><br/>Visually: Vastly disappointing. Some of the blame can be placed on actors who refuse to do the exact same performance and gestures in every take from every angle, but a good editor should be able to work around that. Also, there was way too much camera movement. There was an overkill of shots, oftentimes when it didn't even make sense for the camera to be moving. Artsy shots were overly abundant and oftentimes unnecessary. The Aviator was not written to be an artsy movie, and many interesting shots and camera movements drew attention to themselves rather than intensifying the action. Normally I'm all for trying to film in new ways, but it didn't fit.<br/><br/>Story: A very interesting story, but it's so chaotic (possibly the point) that it makes it almost impossible to follow. Many stories get dropped after their introduction only to be randomly alluded to later. Hughes life was chaotic, but I don't think is a good enough reason to try to make every aspect of the man's life into a main point in the film. All that we, as viewers, get from that is a series of confused, sudden snapshots of a man's life. None of which ever actually make complete sense.<br/><br/>I suggest: If there's a documentary out about the man, that would probably be a better route."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","3","3 August 2006"," Good biopic but not really fully worthy of all the Oscars and nominations.
","This is a good movie but really not worthy of all that Oscar nominations. It's not among the best of 2004 and also certainly not among the best biopics of all time. But you have to give credit where credit is due. ""The Aviator"" is a good movie about an interesting man and an even more interesting life. With every other normal other director at the helm, more people would had been satisfied with the end result but since this movie was directed by Martin Scorsese, people expected more. What a pressure this must be for him. In the end Scorsese doesn't really delivers and his movie is lacking in moments of true greatness. This movie proofs that Scorsese's best years are behind him and that he is lacking in true creativeness in his recent movies. ""The Aviator"" feels as a formulaic done movie that follows all the rules by the book. It's wonderfully done but also because of this the movie doesn't ever really become a remarkable or very memorable one.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is almost 3 hours long, it never drags. Leave it up to Scorsese to make a long, consistent movie, that never loses focus. The story is told with lots of pace and flows well, perhaps even a bit too fast at times. Some sequences don't feel complete and leave an unsatisfying feeling. At times I wanted to know more about a certain event or character. This is unfortunately often the case with biopics. Movies like this, often tell the life of one single person. How is it possible to put everything that happened in a lifetime, in a just under three hours movie. Of course the pace has to be fast and certain events have to be cut down, in order to achieve everything with the story.<br/><br/>Still I feel kind of cheated afterward by the story. While watching this movie it becomes obvious that Scorsese admires Howard Hughes. He glorifies him as a movie-maker and aviator. The movie mainly focuses on his best years and too often too little on the negative aspects of the character. The movie also ends when Hughes was at his prime, when he starts to fall back again, the movie ends. Even though we all know how Hughes eventually ended up, I'm still of opinion that the movie should had shown this, in AT LEAST a prologue before the end credits.<br/><br/>The movie also leaves lots of things unclear, regarding the main character. It's never explained why he was the way he was and how he got so mentally ill. The movie made it seem that he could be normal when he wanted and had to. It makes the character a sort of an inconsistent one, that we never fully get to understand.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio does well as Howard Hughes, the main character. He proofs that he is not only a great actor but also can handle big roles and can carry a movie. Other actors that were really great in this movie were Alec Baldwin and a surprising Alan Alda. The rest of the actors feel a little miss cast. They all seemed to have been cast because of their names. This goes for Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe who play some very uninteresting roles. And Cate Blanchett seemed to had been cast because she's Cate Blanchett, not because she looks like Katharine Hepburn and Kate Beckinsale seemed to had been cast because she's Kate Beckinsale, not because she looks like Ava Gardner. This also goes for actors such as; Jude Law and Gwen Stefani. <br/><br/>But sure on the other hand the movie is technically near perfect. It's well looking and has convincing looking sets and costumes and it manages to recreate the atmosphere mainly of the '20's and '30's. Also great was the cinematography by Robert Richardson but I did not particularly liked the color use, for which this movie received so much technical praise. The special effects were also a big letdown. Why don't I ever hear anyone complaining about this? The flight sequences, which are some of the most significant moments in the movie, looked far from convincing.<br/><br/>The movie is compelling enough to make you keep watching it till the end, since its basically in the end still a very well made one. The end result won't disappoint you but it will probably still leaves a sort of a bad aftertaste, considering that the movie is not entirely a satisfying one.<br/><br/>I don't think that ""The Aviator"" will ever grow into becoming a classic Scorsese movie over the next years, such as with his previous movie ""Taxi Driver"" was the case. The movie is too formulaic made for that and it too often choices the simple path. It lacks true creativeness. Still of course the movie is a great one, that is well made and is far better than any other average biopic/drama. But worthy of all its Oscars and nominations? Sorry, I really don't think so. It makes you wonder, would this movie even had been nominated for that many awards if it was directed by a different director?<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"TheFilmProf","6","1","3","6 June 2006"," Goes For Style; Misses Substance
","Sometimes, more is less. Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is a case in point. Not satisfied with merely reiterating a factual accounting of the life of eccentric billionaire, obsessive/compulsive, filmmaker and aeronautical engineering genius, Howard Hughes, Mr. Scorsese wanted more. Specifically, he wanted to recreate the emotional feel of films from those early years, and the visual look of the film stocks from that era of movie-making that was inherent in the primitive Technicolor and Cinecolor processes. In his quest for more, Mr. Scorsese, not unlike his subject, went to great lengths, artistically, technically and financially. Artistically, with the attention to detail in his color rendition afforded by the existing stock of the 1920s and 1930s; technically, with his first foray into the world of digital image enhancement; and financially with a $112 million budget. Yet, despite its extravagance and applied technology, ""The Aviator"" is a mediocre film, and after 2 hours and 46 minutes, one is left with a kind of 'so what?' feeling. Oddly, whereas a film of that length can begin to drag for the last half hour, ""The Aviator"" dragged for the first half hour. By the end of the film, highlighted by the successful flight of the Spruce Goose, we want more, but we're left with the image of a man who is in his final descent into hell. This film offers no explanations for Hughes' eccentric behavior, save the opening scene of his mother cleansing him, perhaps too attentively, but it does show how his eccentricity and his mental disorder drove him in his quest to be the best at whatever he attempted. Not that he was always successful, at least in the eyes of others. But Hughes was little concerned with what anyone else thought, and maintained a fierce independence and, some would say arrogance, throughout his life.<br/><br/>Despite its mediocrity and unevenness, the film is laced with some fine performances. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the young, flamboyant Hughes, initially seems miscast and unconvincing, but as the film progresses, he becomes much more effective. The opposite is true with Cate Blanchett's depiction of Katharine Hepburn, one of Hughes' early paramours. When first introduced, Ms. Blanchett's speech and mannerisms of Ms. Hepburn are amusingly accurate. But the imitation goes on far too long, through too many unnecessary scenes, and well after we get the point. Also delivering are John C. Reilly as the restrained Noah Dietrich, right-hand man of Hughes who dutifully and sometimes reluctantly carried out the capricious and financially risky wishes of Hughes; Kate Beckinsale as the no nonsense, headstrong Ava Gardner, and in some of the film's most compelling scenes, Alan Alda, as Hughes' congressional nemesis, Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster.<br/><br/>Taken separately, the ingredients in this film would appear to add up to greatness, but they don't. Ultimately, the 'wow' effect just never quite hits, and the reason it doesn't is because the film attempts to get that effect through means that audiences are unlikely to notice since there aren't many who have ever seen a film that was shot on old, pre-1950, nitrate stock, since most of those films, given the unstable nature of that medium, have disintegrated into dust, and their subtle qualities of color and tone must be seen to be understood and appreciated. To his credit, Mr. Scorsese regards form as equally important as content--and that is not a bad thing. In fact it's what most often separates a great film from a mediocre one. But few films, will survive at the box office on style alone. (Francis Ford Coppola's ""One From The Heart"" is an example.) Perhaps paralleling some of Howard Hughes' undertakings, ""The Aviator's"" technological achievement is great, but its practicality too little. And like the Spruce Goose, which, technically, did get off the ground and fly--however briefly--""The Aviator"" does, too. But the plane never flew again and was relegated to becoming a museum conversation piece. Similarly, ""The Aviator"" seems destined to have only a brief moment in history's limelight before it too fades away as a worthy, but impractical endeavor.<br/><br/>© 2005"
"bersarhin","6","1","3","10 March 2006"," Overrated...though that doesn't mean it's bad
","I personally clapped when Million Dollar Baby (a masterpiece) defeated the favorite (this movie) at the 77th Oscars. First of all, Scorsese's film is extremely long. After the first two hours you start to become bored and tired and lose interest in the movie. The film tries to cover too many aspects of the life of Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Definitely the best thing about The Aviator are the performances. DiCaprio has been equally loved and hated with this performance. Yes, he overacts in 70% of the film, but he is playing Howard Hughes, an overacting man himself. Alda also gives us a magnificent and sober performance as the Sentaor that tries to ""defeat"" Hughes. But definitely Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn steals the movie. She is simply MAGNIFICENT in her role as one of the greatest actress ever.<br/><br/>Something else that truly saves the movie is the whole production design. It is simply perfect. The cinematography and art direction are very good.<br/><br/>Now, on to the disapproving bit. The screenplay makes us enter Hughes's mind so deeply that not even in the three hours of film you are able to exit it throughly and close the doors that the film opens. This doesn't have anything to do with the ""open ending"" the film has which is not entirely accurate.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of ""A Beautiful Mind"", not only because it is a biopic of an schizophrenic genius but because they are both highly overrated. This doesn't mean any of the two films are bad, just that they didn't fulfill the expectations both critics and audience had."
"Rich359","4","1","3","19 September 2005"," Ho-hum bio-epic, stilted and self-aware.
","Empty, shallow bio-pic that falls short. Scorcese should stay away from these type of epics- he does not do them well. He seems very self-conscious and stilted in this effort. The movie, with all its detail and budget, looks fake and its narrative cartoon like. Its a expensive TV movie that has little soul. Scorcese wants to be a director like David Lean, or even a John Sturgess, but doesn't have the range of talent these guys had. Stick to the gangsters and the isolated psychopaths- you do that well.<br/><br/>P.S. The scene with Kate Hepburn's family at the dinner table is the highlight of the film."
"hall895","8","1","3","11 July 2005"," A fascinating movie about a fascinating man
","The story of Howard Hughes' life is an amazing one. Where would one even begin trying to tell this tale? Martin Scorsese smartly focuses on Hughes as a young man. It was a time in which Hughes had the world at his fingertips only to let it all slip away in a terrible descent into madness. In The Aviator we see Hughes at his most triumphant but we also see him lose it all as his mind betrays him. Capturing all of this in a terrific performance is Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is brilliant in portraying the young swashbuckling pilot, mogul and ladies' man Hughes was. He also manages to convince in showing Hughes as the beaten shell of a man he would become. It's almost as if DiCaprio had to portray two entirely different characters and he does a magnificent job of it.<br/><br/>While this is clearly DiCaprio's (and by extension Hughes') movie, there are fine performances by a host of other stars portraying many of the key figures in Hughes' life. Most notable is Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, the true love of Hughes' life. It has been said that Hepburn herself was a bit of a caricature, certainly not someone who would be easy to portray, but Blanchett does it brilliantly. She captures the mannerisms, voice, style and heart of Hepburn. It would have been easy to hold something back in this performance for fear of coming off, well, a bit odd. But perhaps Hepburn really was a bit odd and Blanchett really went for it and nailed it. In a bit part as Jean Harlow, Gwen Stefani is really not required to do much more than look pretty, a task she is certainly capable of. While by no means bad, Kate Beckinsale's turn as Ava Gardner is nowhere near as good as Blanchett's. We never really get to know her and the movie suffers for that. And while Beckinsale certainly looks glamorous enough, it seems she is just imitating Ava Gardner whereas by contrast Blanchett truly is Katharine Hepburn.<br/><br/>On the male side of the ledger John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda all do fine work. Reilly plays Noah Deitrich, Hughes' right-hand man who must concern himself with the money because Hughes can't be bothered with such things. His ideas are much too big to be limited by money. Baldwin plays Juan Trippe, who runs Pan Am and in doing so finds his company's position threatened by Hughes' TWA. What's a businessman to do when threatened? Why, take advantage of his relationship with a corrupt politician of course. Alda fills that role and the back and forth between Alda's slimy senator and a defiant DiCaprio is among the film's highlights. As usual, Scorsese has gotten the best out of his cast.<br/><br/>Capturing the essence of a man whose life had so many tremendous peaks and valleys is quite difficult. Add in a potentially crippling mental illness and the challenge gets ratcheted up another notch. Very few directors could have pulled this off but Scorsese succeeds. We go along for a fascinating ride, reveling in Hughes' triumphs and agonizing right along with him in his darkest hours. It is a triumph for Scorsese but perhaps even more so for DiCaprio who brilliantly captures both the genius and the madness of Howard Hughes. Perhaps the film could have been a little more concise but with everything Hughes did in his life it's easy to imagine the film could have actually ended up being much longer. It would be impossible to tell the whole story of Howard Hughes. The story Scorsese and DiCaprio give us is a fascinating and eminently worthwhile one."
"ltd_productions","8","1","3","28 June 2005"," It's not 'Taxi Driver' - but then again, why would it be? This is 'The Aviator'. Well done Mr Scorsese!
","People who say that films should be watched objectively - without letting factors such as 'who directed' and 'who starred?' cloud their judgement - are kidding themselves. Let's admit it. As audiences, it is almost impossible to turn that part of the brain off. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is why Martin Scorsese's 'The Aviator' has been so harshly judged by audiences after its initial release. With a director like Scorsese at the helm, and with an all-star cast of names like DiCaprio, Reilly, Blanchett, Beckinsale (the list could go on) it doesn't come as a surprise that audiences felt they didn't quite get what they were hoping for. <br/><br/>With films such as 'Taxi Driver' and 'Goodfellas' in my all-time fave films list, I too had the high hopes of the 'new Scorsese picture'. However, after an hour or so into the film, I realised that this wasn't going to be a film with DeNiro and Pesci bringing out the big guns ('Like a clown? Do i amuse you?'). But what I did see was a biopic/period film that has sass and class. 'The Aviator' is Martin Scorsese's attempt at bringing a part of Howard Hughes' story to life, whilst re-creating an exciting period in the 20th century. And without tearing this film to shreds like some other pretentious film student would, i will say this... I like it. <br/><br/>DiCaprio reunites with Scorsese after 'Gangs of New York' in a role that almost seems to be second-nature to him now, as an arrogant, young high-flier who's downfall spans the life of the film (think 'The Beach', 'Catch me if you can') - and now in 'The Aviator' - DiCaprio proves to us that he is not just a pretty face, and can actually act. He is supported by a fantastic cast, most notably the chameleon-like Cate Blanchett in her portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. <br/><br/>Scorsese is on the money again. He takes his distinctive visual and editing style to another level - and his use of colour throughout the film is amazing. Biopics sometimes have a tendency to linger with plot, and this is usually because of somebody's attempt to cram in a lot of story in under two hours - but 'The Aviator' as a story flows nicely. It's not a SHORT film by any stretch of the imagination, but it keeps a nice rhythm that in turn, keeps audiences interested (instead of checking their watches). <br/><br/>Though some people may argue that the film only skims the surface of Hughes' life, i think it is fair to say that it is how the FILM should be. If you are so wrapped up in every detail of Hughes' life, then READ a bio about him. But realistically, this is a film, and anything over 3 hours is not going to make an audience happy. Perhaps my only criticism, is the use of CGI for the plane sequences. It looks average, and feels totally out of place in a film like this. Leave that to 'Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow'. <br/><br/>Even if you've never heard of Howard Hughes before (though I'm sure 'The Simpsons' would make that impossible - 'We'll take the Spruce Moose') just see the film. It has its glamorous parts and its poignant parts - but most of all, it's just enjoyable."
"douglasdidier","8","1","3","23 June 2005"," A very worthy film
","I was fairly familiar with the life of Howard Huges going into the film, and knowing the oddities I had very little expectation for this film. Add to that a very overrated actor in Leo Decaprio and I'm surprised I ever sat down to watch it.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The film does a great job throughout of managing functional HH versus dysfunctional HH. It emphasizes the mental defects but does not allow it to take over the film until the very end (much as it took over HH's life in the very end). I was very surprised at the acting for the film. Leo does as great job as do both the K(C)ates (Blanchette and Beckinsale). I did further research into Howard after seeing the film to see how well they did with capturing his likeness, which again, was pulled off very well. Alan Alda also does a great job as the misguided senator.<br/><br/>The downsides to this film are that it moves through things too quickly and skips over several major events late in Howard's life. Unless they were to make this a Trilogy (thank god they didn't) I don't see how they avoid that. Howard did own a whole separate airline after he was forced out of TWA, not to mention completely derailing RKO studios. He moved to Mexico before he died, and all of these things were overlooked. Regardless and excellent film, one of the better historical pieces of recent times."

","I usually don't write too many reviews on Oscar caliber movie since I enjoy complaining more than anything else, but I had to cover a few points for some of the potential viewers that are contemplating whether or not to rent this movie or not. Although ""The Aviator"" is a good movie, but there are some serious long, dry, needless scenes that may make you forget the scenes you did like.<br/><br/>""Aviator"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio, who is still trying to get respect in Hollywood, as Howard Hughes, a rich oil tycoon that suddenly decides to invest an obscene amount of money and time into movies, planes, women and bottled milk. The film is also filled to the brim with tons of Hollywood's finest, especially Kate Blanchet who perfectly plays Katherine Hepburn about as well Jamie Foxx played Ray Charles. Later on through the film you find out there is something more behind his perfectionism, as his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) is unrecognized by the American public.<br/><br/>The movie really starts off with a bang, capturing Hughes over budget movie ""Hell's Angels"", with some of the nicest cinematography I've seen in a long while. Without giving too much away, the film quickly takes a turn and levels off in the excitement section as you witness Hughes's OCD in full effect, practically driving him in to insanity. This is where the film gets long, and I mean long. Besides the fact the the film is close to 170 minutes, after about an hour into to the film the emotion and liveliness in the beginning is replaced by boring, frustrating dialog and context. Seriously, this film makes ""Gods and Generals"" look like ""Die Hard"", making me extremely sympathetic to the audiences that actually saw it in a theater who probably wished they went to an opera instead. In fact, the ending doesn't due Hughes or the film much justice either as it just closes with him going through one of his OCD fits.<br/><br/>With all the torturing boredom aside, ""Aviator"" is still a quality film film that was informative, contained remarkable acting on every part, exceptional cinematography that put's right in to the time frame of the movie. It's also once again another Oscar worthy performance by DiCaprio who still trying to get people to forgive for ""Titanic"" and his good looks. For the most part, I knew pretty much nothing about the Howard Hughes, and the film did it's job by reflecting Hughe's life. ""Aviator"" is not the best biography movies ever made, but it's pretty good and worth at least a rental."

","If this movie would have stuck to the avionics and business/political intrigues of Howard Hughes, it would have been a smash. It's a fantastic movie cinematographically, and the special effects are unmatched. However, the director really fails in defining the Hughs character in a realistic way. Leo clearly doesn't have the depth or scope to portray this intriguing man. As an actor, it is a truism that you can't play a man more complicated and intelligent that you are. That holds true in this case and it might hold true for Scorsese as well- Martin didn't have the scope of vision broad enough to develop a convincing Howard Hughes. <br/><br/>Hughes was a man who grew up alone, fawned over by a couple of aunts. Then, almost overnight this lonely guy inherits a huge amount of money along with a cash cow business. Hughes leaves Houston never to return again. So now Hughes is in Hollywood and in his twenties, a good-looking, tall Texan with millions of dollars. He's making movies and bedding the most beautiful women of his time. Hey, I just don't see the joy and happiness there, and I've seen pictures of Hughes with babes during those times, and he was smiling. And not with the angst-ridden forced smile that Leo shows us. Hughes was happy, and he was enjoying himself. We never see that side of him in the movie. <br/><br/>On a similar note, the Hepburn-Hughes love affair was leaden and just didn't ring true. There was no on-screen chemistry. Blanchette had the accent down, but didn't remotely look like the WASPish Hepburn. Once again, the Scorsese ham-handed this aspect of Hughes' life and the movie suffers for it.<br/><br/>Martin's view that the OCP was the source for Hughes' inspired decisions in business and engineering was also off the mark. I have read that Hughes' problem was that he never could MAKE a decision- he would pester subordinates (who were brilliant) to come up with options and forced THEM to make the actual decision.<br/><br/>In fact, Hughes' downfall was precipitated by the crash of the test plane right after the war. Hughes lost his looks and a lot of his confidence. Plus, he suffered severe head injuries, and who knows how much that affected his persona and thought processes? With the Senate investigation and the actions of PAN AM, I have no doubt that Hughes' house was bugged, and spies were everywhere in his organization. Actress Jean Peters, his wife for a short time, even admitted that she worked for the CIA and reported on Hughes' activities to her superiors, so Hughes' paranoia was certainly justified. And the paranoia fed the OCP- a vicious cycle.<br/><br/>Edited down to two hours, eliminating the Hepburn angle, and drastically cutting down the ""Hughes-as-a-nut case"" scenes (overdone for that time of his life, and, besides, we GET IT, already) this movie would be light years better."

George Clooney or Richard Gere would have brought more power to the role. <br/><br/>Howard Hughes was a larger than life man, with a bit of the devil in him, the only good scene for DiCaprio was before the Senate. <br/><br/>I also think the movie spent too much time on his cleanliness fetish and not enough on his accomplishments.<br/><br/>I thought Cate Blanchett and others were superb in a supporting role, the movie is a little too long. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese did a pretty fair job, but at times the pace was too slow and disconnected.

"paulcreeden","7","1","3","20 February 2005"," Biopic or testimonial?
","This Scorsese-DiCaprio epic is a visual and audible feast. All the media blitzing seems warranted from the perspective of bang for your movie bucks. The special effects are thrilling. The camera work is hypnotizing. The shots are suitably grand or movingly intimate. And, the viewer is guaranteed 170 minutes of semi-solid entertainment. I cringed at the initial sound of Cate's Kate, but I was won over very quickly. I winced at the first sight of Beckinsale's Gardner, but I was soon reassured by her delivery of Ava-speak, frank and earthy. Mr DiCaprio's representation of Hughes was less problematic, since the recluse Hughes left a relatively forgotten audio-visual legacy. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda were really quite good. Alda's Senator Brewster rivals Charles Laughton's Senator Cooley in Preminger's ""Advise and Consent"" (1962).<br/><br/>But, is it biopic or testimonial? And, as either or both, is the film a well constructed and coherent piece of work? The exploration of Howard Hughes' eccentricities certainly is coherently and cogently done. This is no mean feat. The man lived a relatively long and very eventful life, despite crippling personality traits. The political material late in the film did seem more testimonial than biopic. I felt I was fairly warned by the earlier scene, in which Hughes scolds the rich socialists at the Hepburn table in Connecticut. In any case, I think it fair to summarize one of the movie's underlying prejudices as ""Unrestrained capitalism is good."" It is indeed a timely message. However, I wonder if this timely viewpoint will stand the test of time and art."

","Leonardo DiCaprio is marvelous in this movie as the title character. Especially during the Senate hearings, he looks and acts uncannily like Howard Hughes. I was quite fascinated by the movie, especially at first. We learn about Howard Hughes's wide array of interests, including aviation, film-making and actresses. I have read that many like Cate Blanchett as Kathrarine Hepburn. I found that she was a little too exaggerated with her accent, and that distracted me. She did look a lot like Ms Hepburn, though. After the first hour or so, however, the movie started to drag. Yes, we know that Mr. Hughes was rather eccentric and he was (frankly) a little nuts. But all the scenes (slight spoiler) where he's naked in his screening room peeing into bottles get long and monotonous and, yes, boring. I guess I don't mind admitting that I was confused. The movie doesn't really explain (other than blaming Howard's mother in the first scene of the movie) why he was such an obsessive compulsive when it came to cleanliness...and how that obsession turned into madness. I did find it interesting ( if this movie is to be accepted as fact...I somehow doubt it) that while he was in the midst of a break down, he was able to pull himself out of it to appear before congress. Anyway, the movie was worth seeing, but I don't believe it deserves the raves it got."

","I recently saw the Aviator and was riveted by the attention to detail in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio WAS Howard Hughes. He brought an unbelievable amount of reality to this character and rightfully so because he was portraying a legend. You can feel with him as he suffers through hardships, this is so hard to do when you are portraying someone in history. Cate Blanchett, *sigh*. Excellent work. Katherine Hepburn was almost a caricature herself so being her is probably one of the most challenging roles that will ever be attempted. I also loved the minor and supporting actors/actresses in this movie. The only thing that really didn't sink with me was Alec Baldwin's performance, maybe cause he was a villain I have yet to figure out why I didn't get his character in this... Alan Alda, I don't even have to say anything... I love the man! Please see this movie but go to the bathroom before cause it's a long one!"
"kellyadmirer","7","1","3","1 February 2005"," Intriguing
","Who was Howard Hughes? Howard Hughes was Captain Queeg, both the Queeg who wound up mumbling while juggling ball bearings under cross-examination in court and the Queeg rightly praised for helping defend the country behind the scenes before World War II ever started.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes was Elvis, lighting up the world and then slipping off his drug-addicted throne in the night.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes was Nikola Tesla, genius extraordinaire who wound up a lunatic feeding the pigeons on the steps of the NY Public Library.<br/><br/>Yes, Howard Hughes was a flawed genius. Who isn't flawed? I'd like to meet that person. Hughes' flaws were just bigger than some and ultimately consumed him, but he lived a heck of a life.<br/><br/>As to this film, it also is flawed because it doesn't answer the question of who Hughes was, except to portray Hughes as cool but really, really weird. There is no rhyme or reason given for anything. Things are done because Howard Hughes wants them done. Period. An overused attempt at a ""Rosebud"" gimmick attempts to explain everything, but to me at least, explains nothing.<br/><br/>A glaring problem to me is that there is an almost violent obsession in this film with Mr. Hughes' obsessive-compulsive disorder even though that didn't really take on its grotesque dimensions until late in his life. This film wants to paint him as Rainman at the very moment of his last and greatest triumph, the flight of the Spruce Goose. Yes, he died with long fingernails and so forth and so on. But that was almost 30 years later! And even then, he still, in his final years, was able to conduct a lucid telephone interview with reporters to discredit the famed unauthorized ""authorized"" biography. Hughes was still active in Hollywood until the late 1950s. I think that this film's attempt to paint Hughes as a freak during a time when he wasn't one yet - he was just a lovable eccentric throughout his public life - is disappointing.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film show Howard Hughes in action, making instant decisions and pulling the aviation industry ahead with his teeth. The worst parts are the talky and often clunky melodramatic interludes, with inexplicable scenes of girlfriends ramming their cars into his and so forth. The most striking scene is Hughes pulling himself together to testify before the Senate and turning the inquisition back on the inquisitor. The aviation scenes, collectively, make the film, though.<br/><br/>The person I saw this with asked an excellent question as we left. ""Wasn't Hughes ever married?"" That you can sit through a three-hour film on a man and not even get a hint at an answer to that basic question - in fact, you get all sorts of hints at the wrong answer to that question - is inexplicable.<br/><br/>This film has some of the same flaws as ""Gangs of New York."" That film had some excellent scenes, then fell apart when it tried to become a documentary. This film doesn't quite fall apart, but it loses its focus when it forces in unnecessary allusions to Hughes' later problems. There is a lot of great stuff, and a lot of sloppiness to this film. I think that Scorcese is a great film-maker who needs a disciplined editor.<br/><br/>I liked ""The Aviator."" I consider it one of the best of 2004 for a number of reasons, not least because overall it really is favorable to its subject and continues the justified rehabilitation of Howard Hughes that began with ""The Rocketeer."" Leo DiCaprio gives a fabulous performance. But the script is too indulgent, the editing too porous, the effects too showy. Why? To what end? Those are the questions that need to be answered about Mr. Hughes, and they aren't even asked in this film."

","While the Aviator had its good points it also had its been. Leo DiCaprio deserves all the recognition he gets the man definitely deserves that Oscar nomination. Alan Alda I think he deserves it as well he was amazing as the Senator. But what I don't see is why Cate Blanchett has been getting so much praise sure she had the accent down but I really didn't enjoy her performance as Katherine Hepburn at all personally I think she was miscast.Kate Beckinsale on the other hand an amazing performance as per usual she looked ever stunning. and John C Reily superb a god in his own right in the many roles he has played I think he deserved some recognition for his role as well but thats me."
"NoArrow","9","1","3","25 January 2005"," Brilliant, sad
","Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is the tragic story of how a man's grand genius practically destroys his mind. It's also a glorious homage to the golden years of Hollywood, and to a man's strength in expanding upon his empire, defeating his criticizers and, most of the time, winning.<br/><br/>The man is Howard Hughes, infamous movie and airplane mogul who got his start directing ""Hell's Angels"" in the late twenties. The movie opens here, with Hughes begging for just two more cameras, so that he can have twenty-six instead of a mere twenty-four to make the big climactic dogfight scene. Once he succeeds and the movie is nearly done, but then ""The Jazz Singer"" is released and Hughes decides to re-shoot the entire movie in sound. His assistant Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) is skeptical. Everyone is skeptical. Hughes ignores them and does it anyway.<br/><br/>These beginning scenes have a breakneck pace and involve Hugh emptying his pockets over and over again. To everyone else this seems like a plan to go broke, but Hughes sees things in the long run, knowing that if ""Hell's Angels"" is made with sound, more people will see it, more times. He is wise, and knows his plans will pull through in the end; it's his high-strung, nervous demeanor that puts everyone else off.<br/><br/>After ""Hell's Angels"" Hughes switches from making movies to making airplanesfast, revolutionary airplanes. He makes his planes the same way he makes his movies: dozens of last minute improvements, mind-changing, and lots and lots of money loss. He remains confident; it is his stubbornness and ego that drive him to his accomplishments.<br/><br/>But he has a problem, one few know about. It is severe OCD, though I don't think the phrase had been coined yet. Because of some scarring episodes with his mother when he was a child Howard goes through the rest of his life worrying a lot about germs. Since he is an inherited millionaire he is able to feed his worries: people accept it when he asks for one steak and exactly six peas.<br/><br/>Meanwhile he manages to balance this with a life of womanizing. Hughes was famous for dating many successful actresses, of which Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) are seen most in the film.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett does not significantly resemble Hepburn  she probably wouldn't be the first to come to mind for the part  but after seeing her in it I can't imagine anyone else in the part. She is perfectthis girl can act. For anyone else it would be an impersonation but for Blanchett it's a performance. Her scenes are wonderfulthe presence of Hepburn in the movie is not used as a gimmick or a cameo, but as an actual part of the film, a significant part of Hughes' life. She has some very heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes, her performance is a delight, richly deserving her Oscar nomination (and maybe a win too).<br/><br/>Indeed, since most of the cast are playing celebrities, it opens it up for them to overact or impersonate their characters, but all of the actors hit just the right note, like Kate Beckinsale as the proud Gardner or Jude Law showing up as the gaudy, obnoxious Errol Flynn. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda play Hughes foremost enemies: scheming Panam head Juan Trippe and Brewster, the senator that Trippe has bought.<br/><br/>Both Baldwin and Alda have excellent scenes where they try to play off of Hughes' OCD to throw him off during negotiations: one where Trippe speaks to Hughes through an office room door and blows his pipe smoke through the keyhole into the room and another where during a dinner Brewster places a fingertip on Hughes' glass while serving him nearly raw fish. Hughes reacts to both these situations in a different way, but he is always desperately trying to maneuver himself out from under the schemes of those plotting against him.<br/><br/>Hughes does a different kind of maneuvering, in the scenes where his money pays off (or doesn't) when he flies his planes. One scene in particular, is stunning, when Hughes takes his newest plane for a ride, breaks a speed record, but loses control over Beverly Hills. It would be a sin for me to spoil what happens, but I can say that it is an exciting, scary thrill of a scene.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese directs excellently, this is one of his best films. Many of his films take place over a span of many decades, but this is the first one I've seen that captures these periods so beautifully. The cinematography is wonderful, filming each decade the way movies were filmed then (just, with colour), not a gimmick but a smart way of creating a flow. Most films are either all style or all substance, but Scorsese is one of the few who can meld them both into an emotionally and visually intriguing film.<br/><br/>Oh, and Howard Hughes is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, not the first actor you'd think of (like, say, Jason Robards). He doesn't look like the man, no, but why should that be an issue with acting? DiCaprio masters the mannerisms, the glory and the madness. It is a magnificent performance, one that takes a person who was a potential genius and follows him through his life. The film ends on the perfect note, which pretty much sums up the remainder of Hughes life. It is a film to see.<br/><br/>8.5/10."
"awb981","8","1","3","24 January 2005"," Very Exciting!
","This is an extremely watchable movie. A very exciting movie. What this movie is not, is a biography. Myabe it's Mr. Scorsese' opinion of Hughes but I think other biographies and historical documents would find it wanting on truth. But I guess it's his truth.<br/><br/>There's a reasonable amount of action along with the drama, there's even some funny dialog. I was not prepared to be impressed with someone as young as Mr. DiCaprio doing a person from history like Howard Hughes. Hughes is a larger than life character, but the youth of DiCaprio started to disappear as the Hughes character began his decline into madness. Mr. DiCaprio even atarts to look like a young Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Ms. Blanchett is the best part of this movie though. She captures Katherine Hepburn precisely. I have seen most of the late Ms.Hepburn's movies and interviews and Ms. Blanchett's portrayal deserves an Oscar. If her performance were not as good as it is, she would deserve one for such a great effort playing someone as equally larger than life like Ms. Katherine Hepburn."

","The focus of attention naturally is on Leo DiCaprio but Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn steals the picture. A very ritzy lady indeed and I'm glad Spencer Tracy found her so wonderful for so many years. Now to be serious, DiCaprio does an EXCELLENT job as Howard Hughes but he is MISCAST. Even with a moustache, he looks like Hughes's son with a moustache. Even when Leo grows mean,ugly and disturbed in Hughes's later years, he still looks like a warped kid. Indeed, Leo is a very gifted actor but throughout the entire film he reminded me of Jack in ""Titanic."" Oh well, maybe I have a one track mind? The special effects are STUNNING. The color is STUNNING. The story is fascinating. It's going to cop many Oscars and maybe even one for the longest picture of the year however, although I can't pinpoint it,the film lacked that certain something to classify it as monumental. I classify it as a very good picture but NOT great by any means."
"JAKastner","9","1","3","16 January 2005"," The Moose Hole - 'The Aviator' Soars!
","The story for The Aviator resurrects the aberrant life of Howard Hughes and presents it in the grandiose, nostalgic, and mythological style that only Martin Scorsese could have achieved so seamlessly and effectively all at the same time. In spite of its lavish three-hour time length, the film's flow and consistency is never once interrupted by abrupt slow periods, nor does it ever outpace its audience's ability to divulge information at a reasonable pace. Already at this point it is leaps and bounds ahead of the bumbling monstrosity that was Gangs of New York. And although the first few minutes of the picture in which Hughes' mother bathes the young boy in a tub of water in a dimly lit room and speaks to him of avoiding the disease-filled residence of a neighbor may seem a bit awkward when it first starts out, given time it will be made all the more understandable as eloquent symbolism to the sporadic nature of Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes, whether he be the man, the legend, or quite possibly a combination of the two, truly is the focus of this picture and Leonardo DiCaprio, having been snubbed in years past for his roles in both Titanic and Gangs of New York, captures brilliantly the eccentric aviator's maverick personality and from the very first scenes instantly grapples the attention of his audience in much the same way as Hughes would have wanted it done. Whether or not he receives a golden statuette this time around, let alone receives a nomination at the Academy Awards ceremony, DiCaprio, in the short years since his breakout performance in the smash-hit Titanic, has built up quite an impressive resume none-the-less, especially given that he has actually demonstrated true acting potential rather then simply riding the wave of pure publicity and hype. Cate Blanchett, an especially gifted actress who has rounded up in recent years particularly well-deserved acclaim from critics for her roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Veronica Guerin, reflects perfectly the extraordinary, if not often curious, nature of the late-Katharine Hepburn. Alan Alda, famous for his portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce in the acclaimed television series M*A*S*H, proves that in all his years in the glitzy Hollywood business he has failed to lose his touch, giving a brilliantly stark performance as the conniving Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. In a particular scene in which the senator invites Howard to a luncheon meeting in a last ditch effort to avoid a public hearing and have him fold on the refutation of his new aviation bill, he appears as though he takes pleasure in tormenting Hughes' now apparent mental condition, going so far as to pick up a glass at the last minute and place a smudge mark on it directly in Hughes' line of sight. Splendidly Hughes, refusing to be baited and racking his bodily functions to fight back the affects of his mental condition, stuns Brewster by drinking straight out of that glass and forces him to be on the defensive, a position no one, let alone a senator of the United States Congress, finds comfortable. Surely not everything that Hughes did, most notably taking money from the government for projects he never completed or delivered and bribing military contractors, can be defined as just but he can not be blamed entirely for that given that those were the sign of the times. If anything, this investigation brought about a change in the way the aviation industry would be dealt with and Hughes' stern rebuttal of Brewster's true intentions single-handedly restored the idea of capitalism in yet another branch of the U.S. industrial system.<br/><br/>Overall, The Aviator, in much the same light as its subject of discussion, is larger then life itself and for what seems once in a blue moon on the screen that does not go aggressively against it, ensuring its rightful place as the film to beat this awards season. The film ends rather abruptly with Hughes standing directly in front of a grungy bathroom mirror, repeating the phrase ""wave of the future"", and should the audience feel angered or disappointed by this conclusion then Martin Scorsese will have successfully pulled off his desired effect. True to form, the life of Howard Hughes' was never the same again from that moment on. For the mythic man who had done so much in his lifetime up to that point and at the same time had far more yet to accomplish, Hughes' condition spiraled out of control, reducing him to live in total obscurity in one of his several casinos in Las Vegas, dying of kidney failure. That, ladies and gentlemen, is truly the disheartening conclusion to the eccentric, yet majestic, life of Mr. Howard Hughes. The man who perhaps was greatly overshadowed by the legendary figure he helped create and whose shoes he could not fill. Scorsese, a man always willing to be daring and take a risk when it comes to the exact look and feel of a particular film, brilliantly  how many times can that be said of him  captures in each year that is represented the accurate visual style of the color film of that time period, whether it was the old-fashioned Cinecolor or the two-strip Technicolor film. And as the story progresses, the film's appearance matures and fills out more, giving The Aviator a visual quality all its own, setting its miles apart from the competition. Undoubtedly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea, as disappointing as that may be to hear given as how apparently masterful it is, but rest assured that given the proper number of viewings and a through understanding of the life and time of the man who was Howard Hughes, it will be easy for anyone to see as to why this will be the film that gives Scorsese his absurdly overdue Academy Award this year."

","Leonardo DiCaprio gives an outstanding performance as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"". He evolves into a true replica of both the image as well as the persona of this complex character.

Katharine Hepburn is portrayed by Kate Beckinsale and she gives a very convincing performance. Alan Alda is Senator Ralph Owen Brewster of Connecticut who assaults Hughes publicly in his Senate hearings. The psychopathy of Hughes is very believable and pithy. DiCaprio has obviously studied the psychiatric background of schizophrenia with intensity. One is overwhelmed by his characterization, and sympathy evolves for this extremely wealthy character of an earlier time in American History. The airplane scenes alone are worth the price of admission, and my hat goes off to everyone who participated in the making of this important movie.

","The good news is Martin Scorsese's 3 hour film is visually spectacular and completely engrossing from start (almost) to finish. Unfortunately, like any other big Hollywood adventure, the film is ultimately unsatisfying, superficial, and in this particular case, oddly incomplete. If you at satisfied with a biopic that gives broad brush strokes of character, focusing much more on actions than motivations, it is quite possible to love this film. It is a bio-adventure story racing along briskly, jumping from one astonishing accomplishment to another, then from one disaster to another, then back to triumphant sullied by the tragedy of Howard Hughes's incurable insanity. Famous names are thrown around as supporting characters, most prominently Cate Blanchett Katherine Hepburn, (a performance I loved despite mixed-reviews). But even here Scorsese is relying, I suppose, on us bringing our own biographic knowledge to flush out Hepburn (and Ava Gardner), as there is little depth in the on screen portrayals.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is what disappoints  Scorcesse decision to make this much more an adventure story than a character study. We are shown, engrossingly I must admit, Hughes's brash confidence as he makes the most expensive movie ever made (and than just as it is finished extremely late and extremely over-budget, he insists on shooting the whole film again because talking movie have made a big splash while Hell's Angels was being created), builds and flies the fastest plane ever made, builds and flies the largest plane ever assembled, crashes and burns (literally) during a spy plane test flight, and recovers to establish TWA airlines and take on the far larger, government connected, dominant airline of his day (Pan-America). (Side Note: Alan Alda, as the corrupt Maine senator in Pan-Am's pocket, steals the show as far as I am concerned.) <br/><br/>But what disappoints is precisely Scorsese's decision to make an action driven story rather than a character driven story. And it disappoints immensely, not because Scorsese botches the adventure (he doesn't, it's totally engrossing), but because he passes on the chance to flesh- out these amazing characters (Hughes, Hepburn, Gardner) and gives us instead fleshless figures. Icons, not people. The film disappoints because you have wonderful periphery actors (such as those playing Hughes' money man, and engineer) and they have little acting to do. And what disappoints most terribly is the fact that Scorsese is a master of depicting and humanizing complex characters. It is difficult not to feel completely cheated when the director who brought us Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull has a character like Hughes with as much internal terrain to explore, and instead of treating Hughes like LaMotta, Scorsese treats him like Indiana Jones. And here in lies the tragedy of The Aviator<br/><br/>The story synopsis: after a brief tableau of Hughes from childhood, the story depicts Hughes's life beginning in 1928 as he is audaciously filming a WWI epic called Hell's Angels. The film is colossal, over budget, and years in the making. But the film, as Hughes's other projects, is eventually finished and lauded by the world. He is similarly audacious and successful building airplanes, airlines, and taking on Senators. Tragedy strikes when he crashes and almost dies during a spy plane test run. The further tragedy of his mental illness hits hard after his crash recovery, and he spends weeks locked up in a windowless room by himself and completely out of his mind. Hughes must summon the will to return to public life when he is subpoenaed by a senator for war profiteering. He is victorious in his fight against the senator and returns to building aircraft, getting the Spruce Goose off the ground in the film's climax. This climatic triumphant is short lived, however, as Hughes's mental illness impinges on his victory. We are left with the reality that Hughes will continue to have this roller coaster of a life, with sever dips related to his mental state and world-renowned highs for his immense accomplishments. <br/><br/>Should you see it? Go with the low expectations you normally bring to an action movie."
"Chris_Docker","7","1","3","8 January 2005"," Scorsese is on form with this exciting biopic
","The Aviator traces the life of millionaire businessman, film producer, film director, and aviator, Howard Hughes, paying particular attention to his middle years as a record-breaking aviator and movie mogul.<br/><br/>With nearly three hours of viewing time, The Aviator has quite a lot for your money's worth. Fortunately, most of it is gripping enough to keep you fascinated to the very last frame. Scorsese seems to have documented much of Hughes life very accurately, focussing on his exciting involvement in aeroplanes and film-making, rather than the murkier world of his behind the scenes involvement in politics, and stopping before he gets too bogged down with Howard Hughes the weird recluse.<br/><br/>With a host of stars, Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off the title role admirably, the likes of Kate Beckinsale (as Ava Gardner), John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, and Ian Holm all put in good work, and the delightful cameos of Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn keep things moving nicely; but the show-stealer for me was re-creation of screen legend Katharine Hepburn by Cate Blanchett, whose character comes as a vibrant breath of fresh air against a backdrop of fairly right-wing, power-seeking individuals.<br/><br/>In The Aviator, Scorsese has found a subject who is nothing if not interesting. Howard Hughes set revolutions rippling through Hollywood, making - at the time - the most expensive movie ever produced, and his attention to detail is one that Scorsese perhaps admires and even successfully emulates. As an aviator, Hughes pioneered new engineering techniques with almost fanatical zeal, not only breaking most known airspeed records but introducing along the way countersunk rivets and retractable landing gear to reduce wind resistance and so make planes go faster. His own involvement was charismatic  he would fly the planes himself, often risking life and limb, whether to test new prototypes or, even in earlier years, to do dangerous stunts in his films. His brushes with the censors (he created the half-cup bra for his protégé Jane Russell) add further colour to what was already an over-the-top lifestyle, and the fact that he often actually succeeded, even when taking on big business or the government, prevent him from being dismissed as a mere playboy.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes also had some sort of mental aberration, expressing itself as phobias to obsessive behaviour, but the film manages to suggest, to me at least, that his illness may even have helped him towards greatness rather than making him accept and adapt to a more normal level of achievement. But as is often the case with Scorsese, there is no underlying philosophising, no artistic flights of fancy, no deep questions asked or answered. What we do have is good story-telling, and it would perhaps be a bit mean and overcritical to say the result is a bit flat or unimaginative.<br/><br/>As traditional Big Picture movie making goes, The Aviator is a success, and will no doubt garner many awards and delight audiences for years to come."
"Luke99","6","1","3","6 January 2005"," Too Big
","I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. Raging Bull and Goodfellas are two of my favorite movies of all time. They were so good because of the smaller scope of their stories. They were more personal and thus I felt I could get closer to the characters. In Scorcese's two latest films however(Gangs of New York and now The Aviator) he has abandoned the small story for epic biopics. By tackling the grand scale of the life of Howard Hughs in The Aviator, I did not feel the intimacy that made his earlier films so excellent. That is not to say that The Aviator is a poor picture by any means. DiCaprio as Hughs is great and Blanchett is astounding as Hepburn. Her performance should receive recognition by both the foreign press and the academy. Moreover the cinematography (especially in the scenes where Hughs films Hells Angels) is excellent. Nonetheless to me, The Aviator for its lack of intimacy was not an enjoyable film. Because of the hugeness of the film, it drags. I fear that The Aviator will be the big winner this year as it has all the characteristics of recent winners: a famous director, big name actors and an epic plot. I know it would be a crime for Scorsese to never receive an Oscar, but really he is not as deserving for this film as others. What really saved the movie for me was Blanchett's performance. I would not mind seeing her win big this year."
"Doylenf","8","1","3","5 January 2005"," Gorgeous but basically superficial look at Howard Hughes' life...
","THE AVIATOR is a film as eccentric as Howard Hughes himself. It never really explains the germ phobia that possesses him since we are only given one brief scene of his mother bathing him as a boy and requiring him to spell the word ""Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e"". This is supposed to explain his lifelong fear of germs--in effect, it's Martin Scorsese letting us in on the ""Rosebud"" behind his movie before the story even starts--a tribute to Orson Welles perhaps.<br/><br/>With that mystery out of the way, the film proceeds to tell, at length, about the most productive years in the producer's life, a span of twenty years during which he gave the world HELL'S ANGELS, SCARFACE and THE OUTLAW when he wasn't immersing himself in the mysteries of flight.<br/><br/>Like HELL'S ANGELS, the film is best when dealing with the aviation scenes, although all of the Hollywood period elements are done with style, taste and flair. Cate Blanchett, although not exactly a facsimile of Hepburn physically, plays Kate Hepburn with a marvelous sense of timing that catches the Hepburn mannerisms. Instead of dealing with Hughes' other affairs with actresses, Scorsese concentrates mainly on Hepburn with fairly good results. The scene where she takes Hughes home to meet her clan of kinfolk is hilariously staged.<br/><br/>The big test flying accident that did considerable damage to Hughes physically, is stunningly recreated for maximum effect. It certainly never damaged his spirit--and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes with considerable enthusiasm as a man with strong convictions about his passion for aviation. He does a brilliant job despite the fact that he was not ideally cast to play Hughes. His fans will be proud of his work in this one.<br/><br/>Not so fortunate is Jude Law, who, mercifully, appears briefly as Errol Flynn. This is the first truly bad performance I've seen from Law, and a major casting error even though his screen time is limited. Gwen Stefani in no way resembles Jean Harlow facially--only the bleached blonde hairdo lends any credibility to her role. Kate Beckinsdale does a remarkably fine job as Ava Gardner--stunning to look at and giving plenty of gusto to her feisty role.<br/><br/>DiCaprio carries the film and does so with a superb, consistently on target performance. It's clearly his best work since TITANIC.<br/><br/>For a really insightful look at the man who was Howard Hughes you would have to look much further than this slick, extremely well made film that will no doubt please the average movie-goer.<br/><br/>He was a complex man--a billionaire whose conflicting traits made him a paradox--part playboy, part businessman, part inventor--and possessed by demons that eventually destroyed him. It's quite an interesting film but Scorsese never really captures what makes the man tick."

But he has turned in another excellent performance in The Aviator. His gestures in this movie was excellent as well as his overall performance. His dark hair and mustache made him look just like Howard Hughes. This movie although long should boost Leonard's film career and he should be in the running for an Academy Award. I also thought that Kate Blanchett was excellent as Kate Hepburn as well as the rest of the cast. It was a pleasant surprise to see Leonard in a complex role.

","I mostly disagree with Peter-991's review of this movie. The Aviator was very good and well-acted and I do not think Leonardo DiCaprio was miscast at all; on the contrary, I thought he gave one of his best performances and may very well be on his way to an Academy Award for Best Actor. Howard Hughes is a complex and enigmatic character who must have been exceedingly difficult to portray. And one must remember that this film covers the early years of his life, so if the resemblance to Hughes doesn't kick in until the Senate hearings (with the mustache, etc...) then perhaps that's why. Also, the scene at the beginning with is mother was gross but very necessary to the plot. This shows the very foundation for his mental illness and the way she warped his mind against illness and germs through her dialog with him. I agree that Cate Blanchett was very effective as Katharine Hepburn and probably also deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod. However, I felt that Alan Alda, while good in the role, was simply being Hawkeye as an old man. I would recommend this movie as a very compelling look at a man who was brilliant yet also had some very heavy issues in his life."

"universalcritics","9","1","3","2 January 2005"," Hughes in his flight for perfection
","The Aviator delivers on what it promises: a movie about Howard Hughes and his passion for flying. This movie is based on the illustrious billionaire Hughes and his obsession to better aviation while romancing many of Hollywood's leading ladies. Hughes had a great deal of vision and a great deal of drive and many interesting ideas such as flying above the stratosphere. He also enjoyed injecting large sums of money into his privately funded projects. The sky was the limit for this guy. But the line between genius and insanity become extremely fine for this billionaire. Leonardo DiCaprio boldly portrays Hughes in the movie, from the accent to the eccentricities. Hughes many quirks from his childhood only escalated in his adulthood and brought a halt to his own ideology.<br/><br/>DiCaprio was very convincing in his portrayal of the zealous Howard Hughes and his need to succeed in both Hollywood and Aviation while being consumed by his own mental illness. It seems DiCaprio came up with the goods and delivered a performance worth recognition.<br/><br/>The movie commences with Hughes producing a privately financed movie. It is nice to get to watch Perfectionist Hughes make and remake, edit and re-edit his movie and enjoyable to see it done in a fresh and buzzing Hollywood. During production of a movie he pursues the headstrong Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), the most prominent actress around at the time, who engages in a stormy relationship with Hughes. A heart stopping moment in the movie is when Howard takes Katherine up in the plane for some flying lessons.<br/><br/>One track minded Howard becomes relentless in pursuit to own an airline that flies internationally. Of course the competition is sour grapes and Hughes is backed into a corner by Juan Tripp, Pan American Airlines (Alec Baldwin) and a Senator's attempts to bully Howard into a corner.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie portrayed Howard Hughes in his flight for perfection; from his ingenious engineering to his relentless vision as a director and ultimately his demise."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Having read quite a bit about Howard Hughes and having some of my most memorable movie experiences be from the eye of Martin Scorcese, I was most anxious for the release of the film. This may however be one of the few times when Mr. Scorcese actually underplays the importance and legend of a character. The movie is wonderful (typcially breath-taking Scorcese visuals), but falls short of being great, in part because Leonardo DiCaprio is not able to capture the presence of Hughes the man. The look and mannerisms are fine, but we never experience that feeling of greatness that so many talk about when discussing what it was like to be around the man. Some artistic license was taken with Hughes' withdrawal after the near fatal plane crash. Scorcese draws on what he became later to show that the head injury was the beginning of the fall for this very brilliant, tormented man. As usual, Scorcese provides a stellar supporting cast including Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, John C. Riley, Jude Law and Gwen Stefani. Baldwin's ""meeting"" with Hughes held with a door between them is a riveting Baldwin performance similar to ""Glengarry Glen Ross"". John C. Riley perfectly captures the puppy dog loyalty of Noah Dietrich, but the performance that jumps off the screen is Blanchett as Kate Hepburn. I truly believe these two were soul mates who understood each other, but were misunderstood by most everyone else. Hepburn's independent boldness was way ahead of her time. Overall, the movie captures Hughes at the most creative point in his life and does an admirable job, just not great."

","Let me start off by saying that coming into this movie, I knew absolutely nothing about Hughes except that he was paranoid about germs. That said, I loved it.

I'd say he's the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar. Cate Blanchett is awesome, she truly becomes Katherine Hepburn. The script is top-notch, and there is just enough experimentation with camera angles and lighting to keep the viewer interested in what they are seeing (take note of flashbulbs). That being said, there is one flaw I found in the picture, which is that we see what Hughes did, but not why. Why/when did he become interested in aiplanes? Of this, I cannot say. 9/10"

","There may be no person on earth ever more deserving of an Oscar than Martin Scorsese.

(see Paul Sorvino's comments about the first time he saw Goodfellas). Upon reflection many of these people also realize the films to be a tremendous achievement. This is often too late for Oscar but at least makes a showing on the IMDb top 250 and AFI top 100.<br/><br/>The Aviator may change all of this. This film was fantastic.

"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","4","3 May 2010"," Visually stirring and ambitious biopic on legendary rebel billionaire Howard Hughes
","From the talented Martin Scorsesse comes an admittedly ambitious but compelling and visually stirring biopic on legendary rebel billionaire Howard Hughes. Although it is nearly three hours, I don't think the film dragged that much and I was gripped for the whole duration. My problem is to do with the secondary characters though. The Aviator is one of those films where a lot of detail goes into making the protagonist and a few more key characters convincing and relateable, but the secondary characters aren't given as much attention as well. This is not the first film to have this problem though, Kinsey which was still very good had it too, as did Chaplin. Back on target, actors like Willem Dafoe and Ian Holm are not given that much to do, they do fine with what they have, but their characters have the sense of appearing there one minute and disappearing the next. Another problem was that occasionally the drama was lacking, the story was well constructed and paced, and the themes here are very ambitious, but other than well staged plane scenes parts of the more dramatic parts felt somewhat lukewarm.<br/><br/>Complaints aside, this is still a very good film. First of all, it is amazing to look at, the scenery is gorgeous and the costumes are sumptuous. The music is also a delight, beautiful and poignant, dramatic and haunting in others. I loved the small clips of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, orchestrated here and it works(it was originally written for organ you see), and Tchaikovsky's 5th and 6th Symphonies, the latter of which has a final movement that is so heart-rending as it always reminds me of death, don't ask why though. The Aviator is brilliantly directed by Scorcesse, and the script does have moments of meaningful power. And the acting is pretty exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his better post-Titanic performances here, he proves he is more than a person that is all looks no talent, for he really is brilliant as Howard Hughes. Cate Blanchett is wonderful as well as Katherine Hepburn, and Kate Beckinsale surprised me. Like DiCaprio, she too proves that she is more than a pretty face by giving a really good account of herself as Ava Gardner while looking absolutely amazing in the process. In a smaller role, Alec Baldwin was also enjoyable.<br/><br/>Overall, not absolutely outstanding, but The Aviator is a very striking, ambitious and compelling biopic. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"enochsneed","5","1","4","4 May 2008"," A misfire with good flying scenes
","This seems a very odd choice of film for Martin Scorsese. The director I associate with films such as ""Bringing Out the Dead"" has come out with a glossy, superficial biopic which makes a hero out of a rather distasteful (racist, politically *extremely* right-wing, tax-dodging) American millionaire.<br/><br/>There is an element of Greek tragedy about Hughes. By the standards of our culture he was a man who had everything - wealth, power, a string of glamorous lovers - but whose character contained a fatal flaw which destroyed his entire personality. Unfortunately, despite the views of others on this site, I don't feel Leonardo Di Caprio's performance is a success, although he tries hard. He still seems too callow and youthful to play a tormented 40 year-old on the brink of insanity. (When the film was released Di Caprio said there would be nothing 'dramatic' about Hughes as a recluse living in hotel rooms. I beg to differ - the story of a madman living in isolation trying to buy the government of the United States could be fascinating.)<br/><br/>Even as the story of Hughes's early life the film is incomplete - his record-breaking coast-to-coast flight (which he completed without compass or radio) is missing - and sometimes inaccurate (his chief inquisitor in the Senate was Senator Homer Ferguson not Brewster himself).<br/><br/>The supporting cast are equally unable to capture the glamour of the real-life figures they portray. Cate Blanchett has a decent stab at Katharine Hepburn, but Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner is a colourless washout.<br/><br/>The film is saved by exhilarating flying scenes using very good quality CGI (having stood on the prow of a CGI 'Titanic', Di Caprio gets to stand in the nose of a CGI Gotha bomber). The XF-11 crash is horrifically realistic, and the flight of the Hercules a demonstration of sheer guts and will-power in getting the thing into the air.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, the film lacks drama (in terms of character development and a true story arc). It is interesting and sometimes exciting to watch but doesn't go any further with the Howard Hughes story than the Tommy Lee Jones TV mini-series from the 1970's (and that was much better acted)."

","Let's begin by the major flaws of this biopic : it's much too long, and some of the actors are totally miss-casted. What did Martin Scorsese thought about when he hired Kate Beckinsale to play Ava Gardner ? Hello, aren't there some great actresses out here ??? Not to mention Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. The problem with Beckinsale is that she appears on screen only after a magnificent hour spent with Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. Well, that's a performance ! Blanchett is great, even better than great, she IS Hepburn, funny, moving, strong, exuberant, she's a joy to watch, whereas Beckinsale is absolutely transparent ... Well i'm now going to talk about the rest of The Aviator, about the directing for example, so greater than in Gangs of New York (which was already great), inspired, glamorous and filled with self-confidence. DiCaprio is also better than in GONY, much much better, subtle, tormented and wild : mesmerizing. Just like the movie itself, and just like his lovable co-stars Cate Blanchett and Alan Alda."

","After seeing this movie and discussing it with friends, I felt in a rather sorry minority. I thought this film was REALLY good. I came away from it thinking ""Wow. I've just seen an amazing film."" Just at that moment, however, my friend exclaimed - ""That was rubbish!"" A mixed response, then.<br/><br/>So what was it about this film that I liked so much? Maybe it was my extreme dislike of Leonardo DiCaprio being overpowered by his amazingly affecting portrayal of Howard Hughes. Maybe it was my extreme admiration of Cate Blanchett achieving new heights as I witnessed an intricacy of character rarely seen by any actress. Maybe it was the complexity of storyline that seemed to hang together effortlessly, despite going in a plethora of directions. Maybe it was the direction, the writing or the cinematography. Maybe it was all these things. But whatever it was, it did the trick.<br/><br/>Some bad points... My dislike of 'star-studdedness' was something that did not change from watching this film. Scorcese really needs to do something about his obsession for getting at least five major names in every film. It's just annoying. Watching the film, whenever anyone famous came on, my thoughts were simply, ""Big wow."" Great acting, but that's just not the point. It just seems like he's trying to say, ""Look, everybody wants to be in my film."" Why have Jude Law and Ian Holm playing such small parts? Also, it just seemed at times like a spoof of an old school Hollywood movie, with everyone famous playing everyone famous.<br/><br/>Also, I have to agree with those who say that the film did not really 'go anywhere'. It was a shame that although there was great acting, great character study, great effects on the whole, great direction and cinematography, the story was let down a bit through lack of direction and focus. But I don't feel this is a major enough problem to write the film off. For me, everything else in this film made this issue fade away into near obscurity.<br/><br/>My dislike of Kate Beckinsale's acting in this movie was made up for by the likes of Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and John C. Reilly (plus of course the two leads) who were all excellent. A bit of a surprise to see Gwen Stefani, but she held her own pretty well. And fans of the Wainwright family will enjoy the music...<br/><br/>Altogether I thought it was a great film. Lots to see and think about, and simply amazing portrayals of the characters. DiCaprio really makes the movie - which I never thought I'd hear myself saying - as the obsession, insanity, determination, genius, and simply unbelievable balls of Howard Hughes just came out of him as if he were designed for this film.<br/><br/>In conclusion then... I think this film is probably an acquired taste. You won't like it if you just like a good story. You won't like it if you don't like famous actors. You won't like it if you're an obsessive nitpicker. If you like good cinematography, good direction, good acting, and the '30s, you will really like this film. I would say it's worth watching even if you think you won't like it. You may just be surprised..."

","Director Martin Scorsese's latest film, ""The Aviator,"" is a biopic on billionaire Howard Hughes. In this film, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Howard Hughes, filmmaker and aviator, obviously. ""The Aviator"" only shows Hughes' life from about 1920s to the 1940s and stops before his death in the '60s. They show his life with actress Katherine Hepburn (played perfectly by Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), Pan Am president (Alec Baldwin), Senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), and even a run in with famous actor Errol Flynn (Jude Law). The movie follows Hughes on his journey through film-making, insanity, different types of disorders, relationships, and his genius of imagination and pushing of the envelope. <br/><br/>DiCaprio's performance in this film is one of the best I have seen in a while.

Director Martin Scorsese takes on a different challenge from going to his usual violent, dark, and disturbing movies to ones like this.

","The life of reclusive mega-billionaire Howard Hughes (dynamite role for Leonardo DiCaprio) from his innovative film-making in Hollywood in the late-1920s to the post-World War II era where he had to legitimize his role in military aircraft aviation and governmental spending. His relationships with movie starlets (Jean Harlow, played by Gwen Stefani, Katharine Hepburn, played by Cate Blanchett, and Ava Gardner, played by Kate Beckinsale) and confrontations with bigwigs Alec Baldwin (running Pan Am Airlines) and Alan Alda (the senator who ended up bringing Hughes in front of the Congressional Committee) are imperative focal points in this tale. All this and Hughes' never-ending bout with an obsessive-compulsive/germophobia disorder are the major keys in director Martin Scorsese's ode to a highly complicated man and old-time California glitz. Wonderful turns galore (also by cameo performers Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law) and screenwriter John Logan's intelligent take on the material combine with all the aforementioned attributes to create a truly stunning modern-day epic that stands tall with all of Scorsese's earlier credits. With movies like this, the sky is truly the limit to its greatness. 5 stars out of 5."
"seaview1","Null","1","4","9 January 2005"," The Aviator Flies High
","Billionaire Howard Hughes is the subject of an epic biography, The Aviator, and it is just big enough to encompass the early adult years of a reclusive, eccentric original who battles the doubters and his own inner demons. Spearheaded by Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hughes, this project started with Michael Mann (who remains a producer) and was ushered to realization by director Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>The film wisely settles on Hughes' life particularly between 1927 and 1947. A brief opening scene shows Hughes as a boy being washed by his mother while preaching quarantine and cleanliness. Cut to Hughes in the late 1920's as a young man with a tool company in Texas who is trying to film a large scale war film, Hell's Angels. A perfectionist, Hughes is determined to capture great aerial scenes no matter the time and cost. He hires Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to watch the company's finances as he begins to explore the limits of airplane design and travel. He discovers a young starlet, Jean Harlow, and begins romancing some of Hollywood's female glamour stars like Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. Gradually, his compulsive disorders worsen and are complicated by his failed relationships and a couple of near fatal air disasters. His urge to fly and create bigger and faster planes puts him on a collision course with a competitor from Pan Am and ultimately the U.S. Congress.<br/><br/>While Howard Hughes' life has been the stuff of movie material for decades, this big budget film finally marshals the appropriate talent and resources to do it justice. Previously, 1964's The Carpetbaggers seemed inspired by Hughes' film career. In 1977, a TV movie called The Amazing Howard Hughes featuring Tommy Lee Jones did a good job of spanning his life. Even the fanciful comedy/drama Melvin and Howard played on a thread of Hughes' supposed encounter with a stranger. Yet it took the combined might of Miramax and Warner Brothers to give the story the needed blockbuster budget. And if having Scorsese direct a biography is like asking Picasso to do a Superman comic, then so be it. He does an admirable job of depicting intimate scenes and set pieces intermixed with period and story. It is a solid piece of storytelling by a master director working off a good script by John Logan (Gladiator).<br/><br/>What is compelling about Hughes is how reckless and human he was while at the same time becoming a sympathetic victim of his afflictions. As his ticks and behavior become increasingly obsessive, there is a genuine sense of inevitability as we watch the beginnings of his legendary, sanitized lifestyle to come. The scenes involving his clash with the U.S. Senate are like watching a newsreel come to life. It is fascinating stuff even as we are rooting for Hughes to prevail. In the end, Hughes is a slice of the American Dream crossed with the American Tragedy.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is quite good as the aviator and while those that remember the real Hughes may never have dreamed of young Leonardo playing this role, he has embodied the spirit and behavior quite convincingly; he gets the feel and angst of the man. In the latter half of the film, he looks like a dead ringer for Hughes right down to his arched eyebrow.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is strong. Cate Blanchett is excellent as Katharine Hepburn. She not only has Kate's appearance and vocal quality down, but she has made her a vivid, intelligent human whose relationship with Hughes is the focus for much of his life. This is no mere cardboard impersonation. Kate Beckinsale plays Ava Gardner and does credible job in a role which is also important in Hughes' later life. Alan Alda is a standout as an unscrupulous U.S. Senator who is a henchman for air exec, Alec Baldwin. Even the smaller parts are a hoot with such stars as Jude Law playing Errol Flynn and Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Willem Dafoe (The Last Temptation of Christ) has a bit role of a tabloid writer.<br/><br/>As said before, the production is big and splashy. The set designs are top notch from nightclub recreations to air hangars to a congressional hearing room. Costume design (Sandy Powell-Gangs of New York) is like Edith Head reborn. The dramatic musical score (Howard Shore-The Lord of the Rings) is unobtrusive and well integrated in the story. Cinematography (Robert Richardson-Casino) and editing (Thelma Schoonmaker-Raging Bull) in a Scorsese film is always imaginative and unique without calling self attention. The air scenes whether in Hells Angels or the test flights are exhilarating and through live action and special effects, recall some of the exciting moments of The Right Stuff. What are just as impressive are the details in this larger than life production. For example, when Hughes emerges from a self imposed quarantine, his staffers are going about their work wearing white gloves. Film purists will enjoy the clips or references to other Hughes productions like Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this ambitious tale is not only well told, but you get a true sense of the man, and that is no mean feat. Sure, the film is lengthy and drags a little in the second half as it probes his illness, but it isn't long before another scene picks up the plot, and the film moves to a grand scale again. It has been a good year in 2004 for movie biographies, and while The Aviator is the biggest of the bunch it is also one of the best.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of **** stars"

Their biography begins with young Howard (Jacob Davich) being erotically bathed by his mother. Mind you, this is long after the teenage Hughes should be washing himself. So, he's practices spelling ""q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e"" while mother (Amy Sloan) bends down to well, it's ""suggested"" incest (there is nothing overtly sexy in the PG-13-rated film). Presumably, this is why Hughes lost his marbles; read, this is his ""Rosebud"" moment.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" would have been better off following Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" model more closely - about, but not quite so, a familiar figure. Then, the film could be described as ""thinly disguised"" instead of wildly speculative and outrageously fabricated.

","I thought this film was a load of rubbish. The production values were very good, but that's about all.<br/><br/>I found the subject matter of the film was not interesting enough to make into a film. Howard Hughes was not interesting enough a person to base the film around.<br/><br/>I felt that most of the things in this film were unnecessary. By the time the film had ended, I was so glad that I would never have to watch it again.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is hit and miss, with me. He is not a great character actor, and so I felt he didn't fit the part. There was not enough depth to the character that was brought about by acting. I'm not saying that DiCaprio is a bad actor - just that he didn't fit the role at all.<br/><br/>This film is essentially one of the most boring things you'll ever watch. But trust me - it's nowhere near as bad as Gangs of New York. That has to be the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life.

","Howard Hughes was a tiny man in a gigantic world of Fascism, Hitlerism, and Stalinism. My friend Kim, in Salt Lake City, was dressed in his underwear, outside, by his mother, a Mormon. This was some kind of strange ritual, to me a Roman Catholic. It was a non-secret/secret. Adults have secrets. Mormonism is a big honking secret. His underwear and his mother dressing him in underwear were BIG secrets. It was weird. We Catholics in Salt Lake City had our own secrets. Open secrets in a Mormon world/state. I believe Howard Hughes may have grown up in a Mormon situation. Howard Hughes lived a full life and a crippled life which cannot be portrayed in film or text or any medium. Leonardo di Caprio did a great job portraying this sick person Hughes who had a fantastic life. His phobias were great secrets which needed a little open air to deflate their mythic power and thus be dis-armed. It was a sad thing that Hughes's phobias were not thrown asunder as his fantastic ideas were advanced. He deserved better. He deserved the love of Kate Hepburn, I suppose. She was a stellar gal. This is in sum a spectacular movie, which is as good as you could get considering this weird guy Hughes. This is a gigantic movie. Full of ideas. A spectacular gift from director Martin Scorcese."
"moviemanMA","8","1","5","11 July 2005"," Another Scorsese masterpiece!
","Martin Scorsese has been nominated five times for Best Director at the Academy Awards and not once received an Oscar. Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and most recently The Aviator. All of his films have been successes but he has never received credit where credit was due.<br/><br/>In The Aviator, Scorsese depicts the millionaire Howard Hughes; a man who is intelligent, rich as hell, and obsessive compulsive. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the director/aviation expert who wants nothing more than to make more money doing what he loves, not what his father got rich off of. Howard wants to make movies...good movies and to design and fly his own airplanes. In his first film Hell's Angels, he had his own air force built to shoot the realistic dog fights and amazing camera shots. This blockbuster hit took a lot out of him, mentally and financially, but he got it all back.<br/><br/>With the introduction of Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), he finds a person who is rich, famous, and just the person for someone like him. Cate does a phenomenal impersonation of Hepburn and rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Everything seems to be going great for Hughes. He is becoming more of a celebrity and is having some difficulty handling it.<br/><br/>After the success of Hell's Angels, Hughes buys up the majority shares of TWA Airlines. He wants some of his ideas to be made into reality. After breaking the world record of flying speed in an airplane, Howard is ambitious. His ideas for new aircraft and commercial aircraft that are immense are looked at by other rival airlines, such as Pan Am. Everything Howard does is scrutinized by everyone and he starts to crack.<br/><br/>After wrecking his new plane and nearly killing himself, Howard must go on the long road to recovery. Howard was always cautious of germs due to his mother's teachings. His little black bar of soap he uses to wash his hands ""clean"" is of the same nature of Dr. Mannette's work bench in A Tale of Two Cities. Whenever he uses it, he slowly slips back into a bad mental state. Dealing with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is not an easy thing for him. <br/><br/>This movie is a brilliant biopic of a man once thought to be genius and insane at the same time. Howard Hughes is showcased as both in this movie. Scorsese shows how a man tormented in his mind deals with his problems while being in the public eye all the time. DiCaprio is absolutely mind blowing as the millionaire Hughes. His portrayal of the man won him an Oscar nomination. The movie took home five Oscars that night, only one in the major categories (Cate Blanchett).<br/><br/>The look of the movie gives it a vintage look from the roaring 20's right up to the 40's. Scorsese directs a gem with The Aviator. It is visually stunning! Scorsese sure can tell a story. This movie is flying high above the rest."

Cate Blanchett was alright, little on my nerves, Kate Beckinsale was very good with what little she had, and even the bit parts by Gwen Stefani, Jude Law and even random cameo by Willem Dafoe were all very well acted. I was disappointed with the lack of more for Ian Holm to do, but he still did very well.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid effort, and a 9/10 approval.

","I took a huge risk and saw the film with a man who is far more into Fellini and Bergmann than in mainstream Hollywood. However we both enjoyed it and the time just flew, unlike the Spruce Goose. Leo has matured so much as an actor and considering he was in almost every scene it was a big job for him but he embraced it from start to finish. Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn was greatly believable and really showed her conflicts and insecurities. Leo, Cate and Martin Scorsese all deserve top prize for this compelling film that just gave us a glimpse into the character of Hughes.<br/><br/>I got on the internet and read up on the wildly eccentric and quite mentally ill recluse. His connections with the Republican party, the CIA and so much more could only be done in a biography of 3 days or at least a trilogy. A definite ""must see again"" film."

Give me a break, the people he cast must have been his friends, because no one wants to see actors that don't look like who they are portraying. I like the actors in the film, but they should not be in this film, in these parts. Get actors that look like the real people. There are thousands, yes, thousands of SAG actors that can act, that actually look like these people. Why in the world would Marty ruin this film with not one look-a-like?

","For years I have been fond of saying that Leonardo DiCaprio will never win an Oscar. I will now have to revise that statement.<br/><br/>This movie is truly an astounding study in character. And Leo pulls it off fantastically. For the second time in his career, we forget that its Leo and are welcomed inside of the character portrayed. The first, of course, was his performance in Gilbert Grape.<br/><br/>Leo seems bigger than life, and believable when his Howard Hughes, as a young man, says early in the film, ""you tell those (expletives) that even though I'm 21 years old, its MY company and if they don't like it they can kiss my ass!"" (paraphrased) I truly believed at that point that we were in for quite a ride, and that this was Leo's triumphant entry into legend.<br/><br/>The movie brings us all kinds of great stars of the 30's and 40's. The best of these is Katherine Hepburn, played wondrously by Cate Blanchett. This is the first time in my memory that an actor portrayed another actor who wasn't in character. In an understated and completely believable manner, Cate really captured Hepburn's strength, humor and feminine wiles. Few actresses could have pulled this off better. And Cate really looks like a young Katherine.<br/><br/>The supporting cast turn in memorable performances, and there is no weak link among them. John C. Reilly continues to show a gentlemanly persona in every performance.<br/><br/>I loved ""The Aviator"" and am convinced that it will become a golden classic. A sincere 8 out of 10 stars."

","It can't have been easy making an empathetic portrait of Howard Hughes. The man was abrasive, self-centered, and tragically burdened with obsessive-compulsive disorder--a person more likely to alienate than to attract. But that's exactly what director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio have done. They present Hughes in all his flawed glory, yet endear him to the audience so that we root for him in the end, and weep for the ignominious end we know will befall him.<br/><br/>""The Aviator,"" however, is not concerned with Hughes' final days (though it hints liberally at them), but at the prime of his life, beginning in Jazz Age Hollywood and taking us through to the post-WWII era. The plot isn't so much a linear story as it is a study of several key points in Howard Hughes' life: his love for film, planes, and beautiful women, his struggles to establish his TWA as a competitor to PanAm Airlines, the infamous ""Spruce Goose,"" and more. Though the film's three-hour running time is occasionally felt, it is never regretted--Scorsese knows he has a fascinating subject to work with, and his captivating style and sure hand keep things going admirably.<br/><br/>As Howard Hughes, DiCaprio gives one of the best lead performances of the year, ranking right up there with Jamie Foxx's tour-de-force turn as Ray Charles. Even in the film's somewhat slow opening, detailing the filming of Hughes' war-epic ""Hell's Angels,"" he establishes the character as an enthusiastic and determined individual, one for whom ""can't"" is the ultimate four-letter word and money is no object in the pursuit of his visions. Later, as Hughes' inner turmoil becomes more apparent, DiCaprio's furrowed brow and haunted eyes are both compelling and frightening. The sequence which foreshadows Hughes' reclusive final days is one of the most powerful I've seen in recent history.<br/><br/>The film picks up considerably once Cate Blanchett strides onto the screen as brassy, witty Katherine Hepburn; she and DiCaprio have good chemistry as two larger-than-life people who make a complex emotional connection. She is a standout in an ensemble that is strong throughout--Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, John C. Reily, and Kate Beckinsale are among those Scorsese brings in to fill the corners of the screen with vibrant, effective performances.<br/><br/>Though a bit turbulent at times, ""The Aviator"" is by an large a flight worth taking, an examination of a remarkable, unsettling man whose story stays with you long after the credits finish rolling."

","I got prejudices against this movie, even before I watched it! <br/><br/>First of all, it's a Biopic and so far the Hollywood ones proved to be inept: 1) they reorganize the fact to be like they want them to be and not like they are in reality 2) An artist exists by his artistic creation and the process to get them is irrelevant. <br/><br/>Due to the title (aviator) I expected the movie to be just a rich hobby about flying that could only appeal to rich: I don't see why as a simple citizen, I could be interested in such child-play So I put the DVD and start the movie with Scorcese comments: as soon as I understand it's also a movie about (old) Hollywood, my tiny little interest for it just got totally extinguished as for me, movies about movies are the ground-zero of filmmaking: I just don't understand how such movies can be produced except to please the navel-gazing ego-centrism of this little world! It would be like reading books about writing or listening to album about making music! <br/><br/>It's silly, a huge loss of time so I just skip chapters to only watch scenes between DiCaprio and Beckinsale: Sure the production is lavish, every one has fantastic wardrobe but nothing comes of it: later, DiCaprio lives like a hobo in his house and Beckinsale helps him to get ready for a Senate hearing: honestly, why should I care? What's the point to such story? I just don't give it a Sh!t.<br/><br/>This quickest 3 hours movie i watched just adds tons to my opinion that Scorcese is a poor director, totally overrated and he finds such support from the establishment because they just need to find a name!"
"garganspencer","1","1","6","7 August 2014"," Painful to watch!
","Terrible movie. The director is obviously narcissistic and self-indulgent. Badly written. Too many quick cuts back and forth--- obviously, Michael Mann's trademark from his Miami Vice days---but it doesn't work here! DiCaprio's performance was leaden. All the secondary performers were GREAT: Blanchett, Beckinsdale, Ross, the guy who ran Hughes' drill-bit business, even very small parts--like the guy who played L.B. Mayer. (Although Gwen Stefani did not look AT ALL like Jean Harlow). The scene at Hepburn's parents' home was, however, brilliant---probably shot by an assistant director. Too bad so much talent, money, and special effects was wasted on a bloated, incoherent, seemingly-endless ego trip for Scorceze/DiCaprio."
"TxMike","Null","1","6","5 July 2005"," Howard Hughes, flawed genius.
","Superb movie! It deals with Hughes' early adult years, from his 20s through his mid 40s, when he left Houston and invaded Hollywood and Washington, forcing lasting advances in movie-making and flight, and calling the bluff of devious politicians. By any measure Howard Hughes was a genius, always thinking ahead, bigger, better, higher. Nothing was impossible, as long as you had enough money and enough people working for you. He never hesitated to risk going broke when he believed in a project. Suffering from mental disorders now known as ""obssessive/compulsive"" , as it got worse Hughes spent much of his old age as a recluse. But his ideas and those of scientists he hired have changed aviation, space exploration, electronics, communications, and even movie-making. The 2-set DVD has a number of interesting ""extras"" which show how wide Hughes' impact was. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes, and delivers an award-quality performance. Always dependable Cate Blanchett is equally good as Katharine Hepburn, very closely capturing the unique cadence and sound of her voice. Other stars include beautiful Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, head of rival Pan Am Airlines. Alan Alda as the shady Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn. <br/><br/>The opening scene shows a young boy of about 10 or 11 standing nude in a tub of water, his mother bathing him while she says and spells ""quarantine"", while warning young Howard about the dangers of various diseases. This we assume was the seed planted by his mother which, germinating and growing in his adult mind, was responsible for Hughes' mental illness. When both dad and mom were dead while Howard was barely in his 20s, he took the Hughes Tool (oil drilling bits) fortune to Hollywood and satisfied both of his interests, making ""Hells Angels"" about fliers in WW I.<br/><br/>The movie does not try to cover all of Hughes' life, but touches on significant events of a 20-something year period. Desiging and flying a plane that broke speed records. A record flight around the world. Near-death crashes. Failed military contracts, including the Spruce Goose. Romancing the stars. His growing phobias. A landmark film."

","I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan owning many of his westerns in my personal collection. However, if you look at the actual directorial skill between The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby, there is no comparison. The Aviator captured the 1920's perfectly, using the colors that were prominent in films of that time period. The Aviation scenes were outstanding(the crash!!!), the senate hearings, and finally, Hughes'mental breakdown. I do not have OCD, yet I could feel the tension in the bathroom sequence when there are no more paper towels. Million Dollar Baby was very well directed, but simply told a story ala Jack London and relied more on script and acting than the directorial effort. Movie Buffs...please reply on who you think deserves best picture and director. It is a sin that Mr. Scorsese has not received an Oscar"
"Quinoa1984","10","1","6","31 December 2004"," A truly smashing, psychologically bound blockbuster
","Martin Scorsese strikes again with a powerful cast and expert crew, but the subject matter is what really got me into the grip of The Aviator. Scorsese and writer John Logan focus, of course, on the prime of the life of Howard Hughes, a kind of c.f. Kane with airplanes and movies substituting for the newspapers. While Scorsese dives right into his technical mastery, Logan dives into the private life of Hughes as well as the public. As a kind of 'golden-age of Hollywood' production the film hearkens back to the greatness from the old days, but also taking on a subject that is a tough one to take on- Hughes' obsessive compulsive nature. On the outside to the public he does go like this to a degree- spending millions on his air epic Hell's Angels, going past the limit of what to spend on planes for the second world war (and ""the Hercules"" which the press dubbed the ""Spruce Goose""), and with women. But on the inside, he gradually became a full-blown germaphobe, repeating words, and locking himself in a room at one point and not coming out (this would later be what many remembered him for, the notoriously reclusive Billionair hermit of the 20th century).<br/><br/>With Scorsese's outstanding cinematographer Robert Richardson, experimenting with different touches of light and composition, and with his veteran editor Thelma Schoonmaker (partly responsible for the immediately recognizable pace and style in Scorsese's films), they get into the mind of someone like Hughes better than any other film I may have ever seen. It's often kinetic, focusing on the smallest things, and going (appropriately) sometimes like an Olver Stone film. Although Gangs of New York, Scorsese's previous epic, contained a good pace, I may have not seen one as intense and effective since Casino. Adding to this is Dante Ferreti, one of the greatest of all production designers, giving life to all of the locations in the film.<br/><br/>Most surprising, and satisfying, is that the acting is better than expected, or at least topping expectations. Di Caprio, who was the originator of bringing Hughes' life to the screen (he also has an executive producer credit), dashes off any minor doubts I had that he could pull it off. He can be a superb actor, engaging fully a character (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Gangs, and Basketball Diaries being good examples), and sometimes not (Titanic, Catch Me if You Can). This time, he hits it right on the head, giving (though it's never a big deal for me who wins or loses) an Oscar caliber performance. By the time the story and Hughes swing deeper into his disease, before and following a tragic, heart-racing plane accident, he finds all of the touches to make Hughes believable, flaws and all. It certainly is, along with it being the convincing take on o.c.d. technically, the finest portrayal of someone with it. But even greater is that he finds the notes when with his co-stars.<br/><br/>There is Cate Blanchett (as if not more terrific than Di Caprio) as Katherine Hepburn, Hughes' love interest for about ten years. Something of an eccentric character herself, but also very down to earth, Blanchett doesn't skip a beat in finding her own voice within the star. There are also parts like John C. Reilly, Hughes' financial adviser (and part father-figure), Alan Alda, a senator who brings Hughes forward to be questioned in a public committee, Alec Baldwin as Hughes' 'foe' Juan Trippe, and so on. Even for an actress like Kate Beckinsale, who I feared would be hardly worthy to fill a role like Ava Gardner, the environment Scorsese gives to them is very natural considering the Hollywood backdrop.<br/><br/>It's always tricky calling one film the best of the year. Many other films that came out this year were big contenders for such a somewhat pretentious title. It could be appropriate for one to say that The Aviator, while not one of Scorsese's best, is one of the best Hollywood productions of the year. At the least, if only from my perspective, it delivers a Scorsese film where he takes a risk at a subject he doesn't know too much about (aviation, though he didn't know much about boxing either for Raging Bull) and runs with the people in the film, reaching for a height some might feel he can't really take.

","THE AVIATOR is a lengthy biopic directed by Martin Scorsese and covering the life and career of the notorious Howard Hughes, a Hollywood film producer and director and aviation expert. Leonardo DiCaprio bags the main role in an early grown-up star-making turn and does pretty well with it, although he did better in his next Scorsese film, THE DEPARTED. The film as a whole drags a bit and suffers from a surfeit of riches, with too many supporting actors playing famous faces and not all of them doing a very good job (I was cringing at Cate Blanchett's Hepburn portrayal, for example). The first half is by far the worst, a slow run through uninteresting romances and early film-making, but things pick up in the latter part with psychological depth and complexity and some decently-staged quiet tragedies. Scorsese's attempts to give the film an old-fashioned look which develops with the progression of the years is a clever angle, but those bad CGI planes come as an unwelcome surprise."

","The acting and music were impeccable. DiCaprio made a convincing Hughes despite his differing stature/figure to the tall lanky gentleman. DiCaprio's stellar acting ability was repeated as well by the other players, including Alan Alda and Brent Spiner. <br/><br/>Historical facts may or may not bear out the movie. It was said in many books Hughes hated Black People because of a Houston riot when he was a boy. Whether he hated Houston, as alleged in the script, was very questionable also, referring to Houston as a ""disease infested swamp"" (or words to effect). Besides, if he hated Houston as much as inferred in this film, why would he have returned to Houston in 1976 having a renal failure which killed him? Why not return to LA? After all he was in Mexico during the emergency. True, the climate of Southern California is a popular preference to most places in the world, but it is unnecessary to do a put down on the desirability of anyplace by Hollywood, because of seemingly contemporary politics or whatever, of this day. I have doubts this same script would have appeared during the administration of Ann Richards as the Texas Governor in the 1990s.<br/><br/>I have a complaint about over-dependence on CGI, something other reviewers on many films of late are making ""cartoon"" references to, telling complaints about directors who sacrifice the real thing for CGI. The whole drift toward dependency on CGI is fine for Star Wars, but is is utterly silly to substitute CGI for real props (pardon the pun) when the real things are available. It ruined what could have been a stellar ""Aviator"", IMHO. Case in point: Director Scorsese's film enlisted the appearance of a genuine living, airworthy, Lockheed 1049G Constellation wearing, of all things, TWA livery. This airplane was flown all the way from Kansas City to Burbank, restored to perfect flying order, only to be replicated a half dozen times on a tarmac as the big plane for the budding TWA. Isn't CGI great? No flying scenes were taken with that rare living airplane at all...NONE. I was pretty shocked This was a TERRIBLE loss indeed."

","Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) uses his Texas oil money to satisfy his obsession of making a realistic air war movie ""Hell's Angels"". He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). He has obsessive-compulsive disorder and is severely afraid of disease stemming from his mother.

His romance with Hepburn comes to end and he starts a new one with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has given a technically superior movie.

Howard Hughes was the rock star of his day and his genius and downfall are the things of legend.

The film focuses mostly on his earlier days when he was truly in his prime and before mental illness took away his ability to do what he was once world famous for. This is the Howard Hughes we should really remember and admire, a true visionary and a man willing to lose everything in order to accomplish feats that were thought impossible by everyone but himself. That takes guts and a pretty big pair of...well u know. Lol.<br/><br/>Di Caprio shines and impresses again this time as Hughes and I found myself rooting him on to fly higher and go bolder in his magnificent creations, laughing at some of the predicaments he put his right hand men in to get things done the way he needed them to be and admiring this American icon for not settling (even when it came to the steering wheel or even a rivet on one of his planes) and sticking to his vision. The movie itself is visually stunning, the acting is superb throughout and I think it captures the time where the sky was the limit and anything was possible in America. Scorsese will be remembered for many classics but this is one of his finest in my opinion and one of my favorite movies of all."

","Switching from gangsters to one of the most colorful tycoons of industry Martin Scorsese took the first step in making The Aviator a success when he cast Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes. As he did as J. Edgar Hoover, DiCaprio has the spirit of the man invade his body as he portrays the Texas based industrialist, aviator, and movie producer. He had all those careers at the same time and dealt with a lot demons besides.<br/><br/>The Hughes fortune comes from Howard Hughes, Sr. who patented a drill bit that is the foundation of all oil drilling on planet Earth. If you don't use that drill bit, you can dig for oil with a pick and shovel for however long it takes. It is one of the most profitable patents in the world and it was the foundation of the Hughes wealth.<br/><br/>Which allowed Howard Hughes to indulge himself in two passions which were to all intents and purposes, hobbies. Aviation and movie producing were what drove him. And when we meet him he's shooting and reshooting and reshooting Hell's Angels. A lot of his own money went into the film which eventually was a success and gave Hughes the first of many perks as a Hollywood tycoon, Jean Harlow as played here by Gwen Stefani.<br/><br/>Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, and most importantly Katharine Hepburn and there were many others follow in the Hughes story. Cate Blanchett won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for becoming Katharine Hepburn. With some of the liberties taken I don't think it's an accident that The Aviator came out a year after Hepburn died at 96. The movie also missed Jean Peters whom Hughes actually married and Terry Moore who is still alive and who claims she did marry him. Jane Russell and The Outlaw and the famous brassiere personally designed by Hughes also get a passing mention.<br/><br/>As for aviation which was his real love, Hughes had a decades rivalry with Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe of Pan American Airlines. Trippe had more friends in Congress, particularly a rightwing Republican Senator named Ralph Owen Brewster played by Alan Alda. Alda got an Oscar nomination himself playing the smarmy Brewster who threatens to destroy Hughes by Congressional investigation. Hughes who was hardly a liberal in his politics totally turned the tables on the Brewster committee and the Senator himself. Not shown in the film but in 1952 Hughes made it his business to defeat Brewster going for a third term and did.<br/><br/>Besides Blanchett's Oscar The Aviator won several others and was nominated for several more including Best Picture and Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. <br/><br/>In my memory Howard Hughes was the eccentric billionaire who stayed in seclusion and ran his enterprises through a network of underlings. DiCaprio does a wonderful job in showing how Hughes became what he was, his mania against germs instilled by his mother. To have all that money and be living in the largest plastic bubble one could create. Hughes made himself a prisoner in his own mind before he became a prisoner of the jail he personally designed.<br/><br/>The Aviator is a marvelous insight into one of the most eccentric and colorful people of the last century."
"billcr12","10","0","1","21 February 2012"," Scorcese's Epic
","Martin Scorsese delivers an almost three hour epic masterpiece with Leonardo Dicaprio becoming Howard Hughes, with all of his strange behavior, often funny but also tragic. The obsessive compulsive germ phobia manifested by Hughes was rooted in lectures by his mother in his early childhood. <br/><br/>Even with all his bizarre behavior, Hughes was a great visionary, both in aeronautics and the early days of the film industry. Genius and insanity often go hand in hand as was the case in Hughes life. In spite of his mental problems, Hughes managed to build ""The Spruce Goose"" a wooden airplane which was the largest aircraft ever built in the 1940s. He was truly a man ahead of his time. <br/><br/>His movie company enabled him to date many of early Hollywood's leading ladies. Kate Beckinsale shines as Ava Gardner, the one true love of his life. Gardner was the one person without an ulterior motive in Hughes life and the great British actress portraying her really delivers here.<br/><br/>Even with the length of this biography, the story is compelling from beginning to end and is a triumph of film making by Scorsese."

","Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, ""The Aviator"" is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. ""The Aviator"" has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Hughes' life sentence is established in the opening scene. Hughes's mother while bathing the young Hughes, tells him something that perhaps leads to his obsessive compulsive nature. Apparently he is incomplete in his relationship with his mother, and the story surrounding what she said."

","Decades ago when I was at the Wolper Company in Los Angeles, my supervisor, David Seltzer, who wrote the Omen franchise, came into my office and put a book on my desk - a biography of Howard Hughes. ""Could you write a treatment of this?"" Dave asked. ""Sure,"" I said. I skimmed the book and yawned. Why would anyone be interested in Howard Hughes, I asked myself. The same applies to The Aviator. Who cares? And that is the core of the problem with the film. For all its brilliance in so many ways, from casting to photography to music to design, The Aviator is not only state of the art, it achieves a threshold that sets a new standard for motion pictures. But ultimately the film fails because we simply do not care about Howard Hughes, and there are so many reasons why we don't care. Sure, he was a genius, but he was also a bonified nut case and because of that fact alone it is impossible to relate to him much less have any feeling or emotion for him."

Then karma strikes with it's famous quote, ""What goes around, comes around."" Or even why events take place on certain days, during certain times, during certain years? Howard Hughes was one 1920's most wealthiest human beings. Mr. Hughes was film producer & director, an engineer, and of course an American Aviator. Howard is known around the world by many people, he is a very influential figure in our history of Aviation. The 2004 film ""The Aviator"" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, Cate Blanchett (known for ""The Curious Case of Benjamen Buttons"") as Katherine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale (known for ""Pearl Harbor"") as Ava Gardner and John C. Reilly as Mr. Hughes Chief Executive Officer for his empire, Noah Dietrich. Directed by Martin Scoress and written by John Logan. This 50 award winning film (Including 5 Oscars.) is a definite must see biography/drama film. ""The Aviator"" demonstrates class, power, imagination, intelligence, confidence, creativity, willingness, trust, how to manage information, the ability of humans to maintain relationships whether it's with an employee, a friend, a partner, a loved one. It is films like these that are worth watching because of the uplifting script, the powerful sound effects, the realism, the way it all fell into place. Howard Hughes was a man who lived life without limits, which shown in the film and why it deserves 10 out of 10 stars. DiCaprio has once again proved why he can take on challenging roles which is why ""The Aviator"" is a terrific film. So what are you waiting for? Go buy the film, go rent the film, have a movie night with a friends, family, in laws you name it. I guarantee , you will of enjoyed some part of the movie, whether you finish the film jaw dropping loving it, or eye picking hating it. ""The Aviator"" was created for Howard Hughes life experiencing difficulties, education on aircrafts, human interaction skills, entertainment purposes and way more. Go do it watch the movie if you hate it so what? At least you can say ""Howard Hughes was a freak!"" I dare you.<br/><br/>For the record, I'm thirteen and LOVED this movie."

","Lots of computer-generated images in this story of Howard Hughes' career as aviator, businessman, movie make, and heterosexual. I'm pretty sick of CGIs. In this instance, though, I applaud Martin Scorsese's prudent use of them. This isn't a simple and dumb story on which CGIs are hung. That is, the story isn't an excuse for airplanes to dive nose first into the camera or for ten-story-tall gorillas to go ice skating in Central Park. They're used when necessary to advance the exploration of Hughes' character and don't draw attention to themselves. Their impact is more dramatic. That crash of Hughes' experimental reconnaissance airplane with the twin booms is enough to swear anyone off flying for a while.<br/><br/>Hughes himself -- it would be understating the fact to call him eccentric. I did part of a dissertation on Howard Hughes, based on the popular literature available at the time, and the guy we see on screen here is a lot worse off than I was led to believe. What seemed years ago as just the self indulgence of a very rich man now begins to look like the most flagrant form of obsessive-compulsive disorder with paranoid features. He wound up ensconced in a Mexican hotel suite surrounded and guarded and tended by Mormon myrmidons wearing surgical gloves. Everything became static. He watched the same movie (""Ice Station Zebra"") over and over and over, to the point at which his servants, hearing the bombastic score begin behind the opening credits, sank their faces in their hands. He died of kidney shut-down in mid air without a peep.<br/><br/>As a younger man he was far more thumotic. He moved around, spoke to strangers, manipulated women, designed airplanes, spent money recklessly, leaving the business end of things to Noah Dietrich. When Dietrich brought up some financial details, Hughes once waved him away, saying, ""You go down there and do what you want to do."" We get to see quite a lot of the younger, more spirited Hughes. Well, maybe not ""spiritied"" but less stifled. It makes for a more lively movie. It's not merely a caricature of a guy who descended into a disabling mental illness. What would have happened to him if he'd been born poor, instead of heir to a cash cow? He'd have ended up in one of those psychiatric warehouses of the time.<br/><br/>The supporting cast sports some pretty good performances. Cate Blanchett is a marvelous actress and she has Katherine Hepburn's mannerisms down pat, though she looks nothing like the original. The dinner scene with Hepburn's family at their estate in Connecticut tells us about all we need to know about why they are never going to make it. Hughes was a self-educated, obsessive-compulsive Texan, with little curiosity about the world outside of his own keenly focused interests. The Hepburn family reflected a sort of ""liberal arts"" view of life, which is presented as elitist here. And it WAS elitist. But our sympathy for Hughes in this scene doesn't make him any more of a model of populism.<br/><br/>There were some problems with Leonard DiCaprio as Hughes. The main difficulty that I had is one that shouldn't matter but did. DiCaprio adopts a Southern accent but that's about the only resemblance to Hughes. Hughes was extremely tall, a real leptosome, spoke in a slow, smooth, sometimes passionate, Southern drawl. DiCaprio's voice is cracked and quick. And he's short. Tommy Lee Jones gave a more convincing performance in a TV miniseries, even if it was less attention-grabbing.<br/><br/>Nice job of illustrating the relationship between Hughes, on the one hand, and Alec Baldwin's Juan Trippe, who ran both Pan American Airways and an important senator from Maine. Trippe comes off as a master manipulator who systematically eliminated Pan Am's competition. Judging from casual outside reading I've done, this seems to be a widely shared view of Pan Am during the post-war years. The goal of a powerful corporation isn't to encourage competition but to establish a legitimate monopoly and establish a wide moat.<br/><br/>In the end, you can't help feeling sympathy for Hughes, the poor little rich boy who ends the story a little like Citizen Kane, monarch of all he surveys, and with no friends."

","I think Scorsese wanted us to see the full Hughes package. He wanted us to get inside the head of one of the most remarkable tragic figures in history. Since most of Hughe's demons appeared later, the inventiveness and risk taking billionaire (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) dominates the screen. He is a pile driver and gets his way. It makes you wonder if this man had been poor early in life, what would have been the result? This film captures him in his ups and downs. Through all it, however, is the undercurrent that is put to us in the opening scene, that the world is dirty and we need to be protected from it. Howard begins his compulsive behavior at this early age, the seeds of destruction planted by an over protective mother. Along the way we meet Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner (his equal in arrogance), Faith Domergue (""This Island Earth""), and other Hollywood stars (Errol Flynn and Carol Lombard). The movie is a circus. It is fraught with big scenes and painful scenes. I have trouble with biopics because they often are based on one man's view of things (Oliver Stone, for example), but I had a sense that Scorsese had done his homework and was able to keep to the more public Hughes."

I believe he truly had the mannerisms and technique nailed. Gwen Stefani had a small role as Jean Harlow. She came and went. The one who actually surprised me most in this one was Kate Beckinsale who portrayed the voluptuous Ave Gardner. Her intensity made her scenes captivating to watch. <br/><br/>This is must see for anyone with a mind for dreams. I believe Howard Hughes created a whole other planet with his vision, his mind and ideas. Cate Blanchett was the hilarious staccato Katherine Hepburn. She did a swell job on the role although I felt it was a tad too compelled maybe (the Oscar was slightly predictable). Director Martin Scorsese fills the watcher with passion and as I see more of his movies, I do believe he is the master of his unique craft. Truly stunning and the pictures were elaborate to the eye with just a hint of sexually. The plane crash scene was just extraordinary. I almost forget I was watching a movie.

","This biographical drama from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, The Departed) is not as good as the much more accomplished biopic Raging Bull (about Jake La Motta), but it is certainly worth a go. It shows the life of Hollywood mogul and aviator (plane pilot and designer) Howard Hughes (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Leonardo DiCaprio). It shows his making of his only two (directed) films Hell's Angels' and The Outlaw (although he's best known for helping Howard Hawks make the original 1932 Scarface), his affairs with such stars as Ava Gardner (miscast Kate Beckinsale), Jean Harlow (singer Gwen Stefani), and more prominently, the great Katharine Hepburn (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Cate Blanchett), and his millions spent, lost and succeeded on plane design and manufacture. But the scenes I found most intriguing and gripping were his attempts, successes and one big failure in plane test flights (notably the one that almost crippled him), and his slow decent into both bankruptcy and madness, his repeating of phrases is most frequent. Also starring John C. Reilly as Noah Dietrich, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, Oscar and BAFTA nominated Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Sir Ian Holm as Professor Fitz, Danny Huston as Jack Frye, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, Edward Herrmann as Joseph Breen, Willem Dafoe as Roland Sweet, Kelli Garner as Faith Domergue, Adam Scott as Johnny Meyer, Frances Conroy as Mrs. Hepburn, Independence Day's Brent Spiner as Robert Gross, Matt Ross as Glenn Odekirk, Kenneth Welsh as Dr. Thomas Norval Hepburn and Kevin O'Rourke as Spencer Tracy. Most of the actors in this film do look and sound (a little mostly) like who they are meant to be, Blanchett and DiCaprio obviously being best, there are some memorable moments, e.g. the plane crash, and Scorsese makes quite an intense (in parts) film. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Sound Mixing, Best Writing, Original Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Howard Shore, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

","A powerful biopic of sex, insanity and aeroplanes. In any order.<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese directs *The Aviator* based loosely on the life of Howard Hughes, with Leonardo DiCaprio adequately filling the shoes and flying the skies of the eccentric billionaire. (Leo's star status slightly distracts, as does his phony accent. Jim Carrey  originally slated for the role  would have pulled off a better visual hook; young Hughes resembled Tyrone Power more than Leo and the older mustachioed Hughes looked more like Bernie from *Weekend at Bernie's*.) <br/><br/>Set in an era when Scarface was Paul Muni, not Al Pacino; when Hell's Angels were the U.S. Air Force 303rd Bombardment Group, not the guys who killed Meredith Hunter at Altamont; when Jane Russell, not Pam Anderson, was the dirtiest thing on two boobs<br/><br/>*The Aviator* (written by John Logan) follows Hughes from his halcyon days of filming his revolutionary WWII flying aces film, *Hell's Angels* (which would cross over from the silent era to sound, featuring flying sequences to curl toes and splice spleens, and making its star, Jean Harlow, a household name), to his political swashbuckling with airliners and aeroplane building, to his starlet-hopping, to locking himself in his germ-free room drinking his own urine. There is probably not enough time in any feature film to encapsulate the storied misadventures of Hughes, so the breakneck plot touches on everything it can in the time allotted.<br/><br/>The film's narrative flits from one vignette to another, almost as if mirroring Hughes' creatively spasming mind: scandal over starlet's flesh (with Iam Holm giving a grand, impromptu lecture on how much boob exposure is too much); many OCD episodes, from being unable to eat meat once an uninvited guest touches his plate, to suddenly obsessing over washing his hands and then not wanting to touch the bathroom door to exit; electronically bugging his lover's house through jealousy; his aeroplane crash which took off tops of houses in Beverly Hills and left him crippled; his political battles over the largest plane ever built, the H4 Hercules, which flew only once in 1947, with him at the controls <br/><br/>With the ultimate phallic symbol at his fingertips, is it any wonder Hughes made mile-high headlines with Ava Gardener (Kate Beckinsale  mm! lovely!), Katherine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Jean Harlow, (insert any starlet). We can surmise that they didn't fall at Hughes' feet for his looks alone, but because he could fly them to Paris for lunch. The movie portrays Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) as a main squeeze, when in reality she was just another fling. Her character is intimidating enough to throw Hughes momentarily, ""Men can't be friends with women  they must possess them, or leave them be."" Though she burbles truth, she can't live by her words, as her whole ideology breaks down once she settles in as Howard's toy.<br/><br/>Unable to sit still and contemplate anything wisely, Hughes' many mental problems contributed to his diving into unfinished projects, obsessing over small details when the madness took him. He was also a racist - but pretty Leo can't be a racist, so we never see this side of him.<br/><br/>At a party, two suspicious looking characters shadow Hughes, who asks his aide, ""Who are those guys? Do they work for me?"" <br/><br/>""Everybody works for you, Howard."" <br/><br/>Power like that is almost as beautiful as Leo himself."

","Its OK, its a good movie but Scorsese's days in film making as we knew him to be seem to be well over. What we feel now towards this director is a lot of nostalgia. I mean there was this whole thing going on in making this film about him having the same relationship with Di Caprio as the electricity he had with De Niro back in the seventies when making Taxi Driver which is all a load of you know what. I felt this way about De Niro as soon as he left the gangster genre as we knew it. I was not impressed with 'Bringing out the dead' or 'Gangs of New York' all his recent stuff like I was with Taxi driver, Meanstreets, Goodfellas and last but not least Casino which I believe was his last masterpiece, except Kundun which I must admit was really something.

","Howard Hughes makes an interesting choice of subject for Martin Scorsese. This is, as you would expect, beautifully filmed- the colouration process used throughout being of perhaps particular interest. Unfortunately for me, I just didn't buy it. It might just be that I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio- although he puts in (what I personally consider) a career-best performance in this film; or maybe it was an inability to engage fully with the subject- Howard Hughes is probably a somewhat obscure figure to most people nowadays, besides it is possibly difficult for most people to identify with a reclusive billionaire. Another point that can be made is that there are several continuity and factual errors throughout the film. Although this is not immediately obvious on first viewing, it leaves the impression that perhaps the film crew's attention was not as focused as it might have been during shooting, and this is certainly the impression that I was left with.

Scorsese paints his scenes with oblique brush strokes and his icons take their forms.<br/><br/>As the film opens, the audience is shown the young Howard Hughes being washed, tested and warned by his mother. They are sequestered in a large, quiet, clean parlour room. A fear of outside contamination is being inculcated into his psyche. John Logan, the film's scriptwriter, seems to be saying that Howard's formative years were spent in very protective custody. The safety of home, of being inside with one's parents, especially with one's mother. The oblique reference here is to ""Citizen Kane"" and his sheltered childhood. 'Rosebud' becomes 'Quarantine. Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e. Quarantine', a semi-mystic recurrence.<br/><br/>You are conscious that you are watching film from the beginning to end of ""The Aviator"". Cinema itself becomes a kind of religious artifact for Scorsese as his choice, to use the more primitive colour technology of the 30s (film stock registering reds and blues, but not greens) to shoot the first half of the movie, demonstrates. His selection of quality period music is impeccable and exciting in itself. Hence, authenticity in ""The Aviator"" is reserved for art. Approximation will do for life. The realities of Hughes', Hepburn's, Domergue's and Gardener's lives, amongst others portrayed in the film, take a back seat to Scorsese's artistic license. And this is not really such a bad thing, although that observation occasionally goes unappreciated because of the proclivity of certain people go to the movies to vicariously experience the lives of real people. They feel cheated when that experience is denied, even when it is artistically, that is, consciously short circuited.<br/><br/>Thus, it is difficult for many audience members to get their heads around the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes. He's not supposed to be the real Hughes. He is an icon representing Hughes. Sure, that happens in other movies too. But, in this one, it is different. You can never suspend your disbelief as in the way you would in say, Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"". Neither can you suspend your disbelief that Cate Blanchett IS Katherine Hepburn. Even Cate's mastering of the Hepburn's signature accent is not on, in terms of getting you to believe that she is anybody but Cate Blanchett. Still, one does very much appreciate the acting abilities of everyone in this film, including Kate Beckinsale, but nobody who has actually seen Ava Gardener in movies like ""Night of the Iguana"" can find Beckinsale other than a finely sculpted representation of the voluptuous Ms. Gardener. And as for Alan 'the MASH' Alda, playing the corrupt, McCarthy era Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, please, it's just not possible. Still, they're all excellent when taken in the context of the totality which is ""The Aviator"". The actors remain engaging, even as the film itself moves with its own kind of surrealist animus.<br/><br/>As George Orwell accurately observed, ""All art is propaganda, but not all propaganda is art."" Fortunately, ""The Aviator"" is both. Its art can be found in its cinematographic beauty, the quality of the performances and direction and in its meaning. Hughes was an archetype of the entrepreneurial spirit of Christmases past; a time when one man could use his accumulated wealth to achieve the goals his imagination generated. In his own filmic way, Scorsese has replayed the American dream which swirls in so many minds today; the dream of capitalism and freedom; the dream of near, absolute power to change the world. Hughes had all of this, of course. At one paranoid point in the film, Hughes asks one of his confidants, ""Who is that man? Does he work for me?"" To which, one of his executive hirelings replies, ""Why Mr. Hughes, everyone works for you.""<br/><br/>The Hughes and Hepburn of ""The Aviator"" represent those dreamy icons. They are at their peak in the depths of the Great Depression. At a time when Woody Guthrie would be walking out on a well paid gig at the Coconut Grove to hop a freight and preserve his sense of integrity, Hughes would be thinking of buying the Grove as he obsessively planned his next Hollywood blockbuster. Meanwhile, the glam-dame Hepburn would be seeking solace in Howard's courage to challenge the petty-minded money changers of the sexist Hollywood Establishment. To be sure, Hughes backed up his daring with financial power and a proved ability to beat the odds while making money at creatively inspired projects. Hughes' qualities were not lost on the astute Hepburn. In ""The Aviator"", they enjoy a mutual affection which was driven by more than money. In ""The Aviator"", it's pure audacity which makes them ""cling"" together like two glasses of Veuve Clicquot while flying Howard's plane around the skies of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>This is a great artistic opus, from the consciously chosen uses of form: the primitive two-colour process during the first half of ""The Aviator"", to the content embedded in philosophical-political-psychological messages running through the whole of its 170 minute run-time. Martin Scorsese is the Orson Wells of our time.<br/><br/>""Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the human hand; the power of knowledge, objectified. The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process.""

","The Aviator, one of the newer films by Martin Scorcese, is a knock out classic film by the directing genius. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, who before this movie I haven't really taken seriously (I mean, he was okay in Titanic, but I never considered him a great actor) - but in this film, he really authentically portrayed Howard Hughes and his various ticks that is was amazing. A very well done performance. Cate Blanchett also deserves kudos for a realistic portrayal of Katherine Hepburn (RIP). The score by Howard Shore also deserves special mention - he created another classic musical theme (as he did repeatedly with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) - I look forward to this composer's future ventures. Overall, with a strong script, beautiful production design, and the aforementioned pluses, this is a must see - 8 out of 10."
"theshadow908","8","0","1","1 March 2006"," Probably the best biographical film I've ever seen.
","The Aviator is an outstanding and epic film about the life of eccentric businessman Howard Hughes. It chronicles his life from his turn as a film director up to when he got his flying boat, the Hercules (or as we know it as, the Spruce Goose) to fly. It covers his relationships with some of Hollywood's most famous women as well as his struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is probably Leonardo DiCaprio's best role. Every single person in the cast literally becomes their role from DiCaprio's spot on performance as Hughes to Cate Blanchett's incredible performance as Katherine Hepburn. I also enjoyed how a few great leading actors popped up in bit roles and played them really well, such as Jude Law as Errol Flynn and Willem Dafoe as a reporter. Martin Scorsese did a great job as always directing this movie. He has a real good eye for the movies he chooses to direct, because he does them all wonderfully. I really think that he was robbed of a best director Oscar. Million Dollar Baby really didn't deserve the best picture Oscar over this far superior film.<br/><br/>The movie is about 3 hours long, but if you're interested in this type of film, it shouldn't really matter. It covers all the important things you need to know about Howard Hughes. I would now really like to see a film about the later years of Hughes' life. This is one of the best movies of 2004, and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes an epic film.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Alex-372","8","0","2","19 February 2006"," Howard Hughes: Descent Into Madness
","Martin Scorcese directed Howard Hughes as a cross between Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"") and Mr. Monk. Does he get away with it? <br/><br/>The movie makers can't seem to decide whether Howard Hughes was a germophobe, suffering from autism or from obsessive compulsive disorder. What they leave out is the addiction to amphetamines and morphine. Scorcese left out a lot of other things too, like the pervasive anti-Black racism and anti-Semitism of the time and the place, including Hughes', just as Scorcese left out the fact that ""Gangs Of New York"" was essentially about a Civil War era anti-Black race riot. Scorcese also left out Howard Hughes' role in the communist witch hunts of the 1950s, instead portraying him as being the victim of a vindictive and corrupt senator (Alan Alda). Like the racism of the time, the movie forgets to mention Hughes' rabid anti-communism, his firing of a blacklisted writer and his suppression of the pro-labor movie ""Salt Of The Earth"". The fact that one of Hughes' passenger planes crashes (undoubtedly killing all on board) is mentioned and forgotten, and almost seems to be justified by the fact that Hughes himself frequently crashes his own planes. Unlike in the movie, the real Howard was not born poor to a hygiene obsessed mother (in real life, he actually contracted syphillis, decades before there was a cure for it), but to a father who left him a fortune and an engineering business. <br/><br/>The truth is that Howard Hughes was a rich boy and elitist oligarch, and that the fortune his father made selling a unique oil drill bit in Houston was against the background of Black disenfranchisement, including land theft, in Texas. Hughes made ""Hells Angels"" during the early 1920s, a time when the klan was reaching its highpoint of popularity, was even finding a willing ear in the White House, and saw the burning down and mass murder of highly successful Black communities in Oklahoma City, Kansas City and other towns by resentful Whites. The only hints of racism come from the all White minstrels doing some kind of exhalted ""race music"" dance. Why only hint? Because giving us a picture of the real Howard Hughes would have left the movie without a sympathetic lead. Beside being a racist and anti-Semite, Hughes was also a rapist and a bisexual, the former only hinted at by Leonardo DiCaprio's sweet come-on to a surprisingly willing waitress in a restaurant. I guess those were the perks of wealth in the 1920s. <br/><br/>Scorcese's treatment of the Hepburn family, who were social reformers and socialists, also warrants mention. They are portrayed as stuck up champaign socialists, when in fact they were actively campaigning for women's right to vote, and were friends and supporters of Emma Goldman. <br/><br/>Perhaps someone as rich as Howard Hughes could afford not to notice The Great Depression, but that is no excuse for Martin Scorcese to do the same. The start of WWII is not dealt with. Hughes support for the overthrow of Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution, or his ties to the CIA are not mentioned either. <br/><br/>Now about the movie. Everyone seems to have wanted to be part of this production. Kate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Jude Law, Kate Beckinsale, Willem Dafoe, Gwen Stefani, with Martin Scorcese directing and Michael Mann producing. I'm sure they thought they were in for a rip-roaring tale of great wealth, Hollywood glamor and cutting edge airoplanes, and they were. <br/><br/>The flight scenes are exciting and spectacular (including the crashes). <br/><br/>I give this movie 8 stars out of 10, not for Howard Hughes, but for Leonardo DiCaprio and the movie, which although long, never fails to capture your attention and tells a rather sympathetic, though fictional, tale."
"happy_hangman","Null","0","1","19 January 2006"," A Worthy Effort, But One Which Could Have Flown Higher
","I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would. I like Scorcese, particularly his early films where imagination and narrative focus triumphed over budget. The years following 'Cape Fear' I found a little too self consciously concerned with stylistic tricks (and traps) borrowed from the European film-makers the director admired  there are, for example, parts of 'Casino' that are pure Michael Powell  a reaction, no doubt, against critics who cast him as master of grim-'n'-gritty urban realism, and the only successor to Cassavetes as King of the Indies. One thing which has been consistent throughout his career is his determination to capture cultural snap-shots of Americana  from the discordant Europeaniism of Wharton's 'Age of Innocence' and the chaos of 'Gangs of New York', through the re-invention of the first great US cinematic innovation, the mob-movie, to the contemporary union of dysfunctional family and celluloid-sociopathy, 'Cape Fear'. In a sense all of his films are concerned with the American cultural obsession with identity: Travis Bickle reinvents himself, the city itself is shaped by ethnic divisions in 'Gangs', etc.. In some respects it's surprising that it took him so long to turn his eye upon the life of Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>There are (conscious, I think) references a-plenty to 'Citizen Kane' as Marty tries to make sense of the obsessive-compulsive genius and unwilling celebrity. Hardly surprising given the subject matter. Like Kane Hughes dominates those around him, but is capable of great kindness in their defence, and like Kane his greatest repulsion is the notion of personal hypocrisy. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what I believe to be his best performance, turning in a nicely nuanced disturbing and sympathetic turn as the hero. I've known a few obsessive-compulsives in my time and his performance hits just the right note: we can see why others believed him a freak or a monster, but this understanding is undercut by sympathy for his schizophrenia. In some scenes the overriding feeling is of watching him crash-and burn, both emotionally and literally.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchet's turn as Kathering Hepburn is more problematic. It's astonishingly stilted, but this is a consequence more than anything else of the character being one of the most imitated icons of Hollywood's Golden Age: Katie was astonishingly stilted. Once the myriad of mannerisms settle it's a fine performance  though not, perhaps, one worthy of a Best Supporting Actress gong. Kate Beckinsale has an easier job as Ava Gardner, more famous at the time, but less lastingly memorable as an icon (how many Ava Gardner films can you think of, off hand?). She gets to fluff around in furs looking exotic.<br/><br/>John C. Reilly, as Hughes business manager, is excellent, as always. If someone can find a flick that the bulldog-faced bloke isn't good in I'll be most surprised. He's proof that 'character-actor' is still a valid job description. Alec Baldwin (who, it seems, has been at the pies again) is suitably oily as the Pan-Am CEO.<br/><br/>Scene setting and staging is kept surprisingly simple, particularly given Mr S's predilection of late for tricksy scene-segues and edits, and he spares the CGI gimmicks until the big action scenes when they can be of most effect. <br/><br/>All in all it's no 'Citizen Kane', but it will stand, I believe as a sympathetic but not entirely uncritical tribute to an American Icon  and a reminder of precisely why he was an icon, rather than the twitching freak of more recent memory."

","Unless the viewer hasn't read up on Howard Hughes' life, they might not understand what is going on. For instance when he burned all his clothes after Hepburn broke up with him, I read that he did burn all his clothes but after finding that one of his girl friends had venereal disease. This might insinuate that Hepburn had venereal disease. Looking up if Hepburn had a disease, I found that her dad was a doctor who advanced venereal disease prevention which Kathryn later took up. One might assume from this that perhaps her father's connection with venereal disease was because his daughter may have had it. In the movie it appears as though Howard burned his clothes in reaction to Hepburn breaking off with him which doesn't make any sense only in the context of his life where at some point he burned all his clothes upon learning that one his girlfriends had venereal disease."

","Aviator was one of my favorite films of 04. A brilliant script, cast, and director to boot, without knowing anything of who this man was, I was deeply impressed.<br/><br/>This movie tells the tale of the billionaire dreamer before he became the obsessive recluse we've all heard about. Leonardo DiCaprio completely captures the essence of a man consumed by all things in life. High strung and driven, we are really shown the soul of a man who wasn't afraid to make his dreams his first priority, even ahead of his own health and well-being. We are introduced to a man who didn't allow himself the time to deal with the hurt and sorrow that come along with the loss of love. He was just to busy being a visionary.<br/><br/>I truly believe that if there had been no Jamie Foxx and ""Ray,"" Dicaprio would have easily walked away with Oscar gold.

","I maybe not very objective on this one, cause I truly love Scorsese's vision of cinema. Nobody finds the golden midst of mainstream- and art-cinema like Scorsese does. There maybe no perfection but Scorsese comes very close! Music, pictures and acting at its very best. Leonardo Dicaprio, being the best actor of his decade, gives his best performance so far! Incredible! All other actors and actresses are great none the less. Scorsese always finds the way of getting just the best out of his actors: Alec Baldwin, who would've thought that?! The soundtrack is to fall in love with, as are all of Scorsese's movies. The movie itself is hard to describe, it's a weird ride. Scorseses and his teams (Schoonmaker, Ferretti etc.) passion for movies shows in every detail. This movie is not to miss. If it weren't for ""Million Dollar Baby"" (also fantastic, no question) Scorsese would've gotten his Oscar, which is long over due, but what is an Oscar anyhow?! Appreciation, and he's got that for eternity. The Oscar is just a question of time... the departed!? Can't wait to see it. <br/><br/>Arend Remmers, Berlin, Germany"
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","1","6 November 2005"," The Aviator
","Howard Hughes' life was like a dark fairy tale, one in which the hero woos all the princesses and becomes a hero to the people, but at a terrible personal price. Chiefly remembered by most people as the loony billionaire recluse of the 70s who shuffled around his penthouse hotel suite with his feet in tissue boxes, he was, of course, a genius. And, like many geniuses, he balanced precariously on that line that divides genius and madness for much of his life before toppling irrevocably over in a fashion as spectacular as the air crash that left him with nearly 80% burns.<br/><br/>With their opening scene, a strangely eroticised 'flashback' of Hughes as a boy being bathed by his mother and warned about cholera and typhus and q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e, Scorsese and scriptwriter John Logan seem to place the blame for Hughes' subsequent phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder squarely on the shoulders of his mother. This may be true, but a solitary scene before moving on to the filming of Hell's Angels does little to convince or inform, or provide credible background for Hughes' subsequent mental problems.<br/><br/>Apart from this one scene, the film focuses on an approximately twenty-year period from 1927 to the Brewster Senate hearings and Hughes' piloting of the Spruce Goose after WWII. Hughes' love life, his engineering and business genius, and his increasing phobia over germs are given pretty much equal screen time, and the film does a reasonable job of slowly focusing more on the phobias as they begin to take over his life. Strangely enough, you'd think this aspect of his life would make up the more interesting part of the film, but it's when Hughes is shown at his most damaged that the film begins to drag. The imagery at this point is clumsy and uninspired and the film threatens to veer as badly out of control as Hughes did. Perhaps that was Scorsese's intention, but you're left with the impression of having been given a peep at a freak show rather than an examination of a man's breakdown.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio continues to surprise with his success at tackling difficult roles for which he would seem to be unsuitable. He gives an entirely believable and sympathetic performance here, capturing both the energy of the man and the mental and emotional insecurities he suffered, while managing to avoid the pitfalls that are inherent to such a part. The supporting cast also deliver uniformly excellent performances. Cate Blanchett, while not really resembling Katharine Hepburn, manages to capture her tone and inflections and mannerisms, while Kate Beckinsale is passable despite never really capturing the essence of Ava Gardner in the same way that Blanchett does with Hepburn.<br/><br/>This being a Scorsese film, it is, of course, technically brilliant. His decision to play with colour on some scenes is perhaps a little misguided, but he does tone down his often kinetic style, which would have been wholly inappropriate for a story like this. There are some great aerial shots and an incredible air crash, but the highlight for me was the barnstorming Brewster Senate Committee Hearings in which the malicious senator, excellently portrayed here by Alan Alda, is torn to shreds by a briefly recuperated Hughes.<br/><br/>While this film isn't flawless, it's doubtful that we will see a better biopic about Howard Hughes. It's just a shame that so many of the CGI effects are so blatantly shoddy."

","First of all, can I say anything else but wow! Then again, what can you expect from America's finest actor, Alec Baldwin? Initially I was very disinterested in the film when I was under the impression that Leo was the only big-name actor it had to offer. However, when I saw that one of my all time favorite entertainers, Alec, was in it I just had to see!! Sadly, Alec's part was not very large and so the whole of this review will be focusing on Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>You might at first expect the film to be boring, what with its excessively long time frame. However, as they say, time flies when you're having fun and you'll definitely have fun watching this exciting film! My favorite part had to be when Howard Hughes locked himself away for days. At first I was appalled when I realized that DiCaprio was indeed nude. However, the nudity was done rather tastefully and not at all pornographically like in other Hollywood films of this day in age. The raw emotion portrayed in this bit of the film was amazing. It literally had me in tears! I feared it was the end of the movie when in fact, it was only the beginning! Next thing you know, Hughes is off to a conference with the despicable Senator Ralph Owen Brewster who is artfully portrayed by acting veteran Alan Alda. Despite my dislike for DiCaprio, I was routing for Hughes the entire time! I was relieved when he overcame those mean old senators and got his way! What I would also like to mention is DiCaprio's amazing portrayal of Hughes' speech problem. It was incredibly believable when he could not stop saying, ""It's the way of the future."" I mean what a way to end a film!! Just...wow.<br/><br/>The final thing I will speak about is the amazing group of ladies in this movie! Cate Blanchett was absolutely amazing as Katharine Hepburn! A five star performance! Kate Beckinsale did wonderfully as Ava Gardner, and Gwen Stefani was stunning as Jean Harlow. Great work girls! All in all, The Aviator is an outstanding piece of cinematic work that people of all ages can enjoy! The actors and actresses deserve to be honored for years to come for their awesome work."

","We've all seen one movie that simply moved us in an extraordinary way. For me, it would have to be The Aviator. I'm not going to argue about how great the movie was or how high it ranks on my ""personal movie list"" simply because every single person is different. I loved the movie, but I can totally relate, in one way or another, to a person that hated this movie. The fact of the matter is that even the person who thought the movie was lackluster probably acknowledges (somewhere in their consciousness) the fact that the movie was much different than any other they've seen in a while. The movie's best quality, in my opinion, is its originality. The airplane sequences, the lavish Hollywood parties and the way the movie was shot (not with a standard camera but with another type) definitely contributed to its originality. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was how ""heavy"" it really was at times. From a critics' point of view, this movie ranks among the best of the year, but then again, Fight Club was harshly criticized and it turned out to be what our ""lost generation"" was lusting for."

Cate Blanchett shines as the leading lady, great to see her working with scorsese. The supporting cast is great as well, kate beckinsale was believable and good as ava gardner a few steps up from her poor acting in pearl harbor. Adam Scott was also good in this film. John C. Reily, Alan Alda and Ian Holm all gave great supporting performances as well. The film has a great score by Howard Shore, and great cinematography by a very talented Robert Richardson (Bringing out the dead, u-turn, casino), this guy has filmed some of my favorite films, great cinematography in aviator as well. There was nothing i didn't like about this film, I mean i usually am critical of Scorsese, but i don't see why people bash his later efforts, his past 3 films are all personal favorites of mine and although they don't rank as high as Taxi Driver, Casino, and Goodfellas in my favorite film list, they are still up there.

","I really enjoyed this movie. I am not a big fan of DiCaprio, but I have to say hats of to the guy, this was an excellent performance.<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of talk about the character of Hughes as not being likable, and perhaps this is not the best way to make people like the film. I have to disagree, this is a commentary on a major figure in aviation history. What would be the point in making a film about him and changing him so that he was more likable? By all accounts he was a man driven incessantly by a desire to succeed, to go one step further in aviation. DiCaprio captured this about the man completely. Of course as most truly driven people are, he made enemies and some people simply found him too much. He would have not been an easy man to be around, even when his psychological problems were not affecting him. If the character had been softened to make him easier to like, then it would not have been a film about Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>Nevertheless as the film progresses there is clearly a sense of loyalty toward the man from the growing population of people who work for him, he is clearly looked up to and there is the desire of his closest colleagues and friends to keep his problems out of the headlines, to protect him from pressure and harm. Even though he may not have been the easiest man to like, it is clear that he was liked by a great many people.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett was just perfect as Kathryn Hepburn as was Kate Bekinsale as Ava Gardener, and the insight into 1920-40 Hollywood was interesting.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Alec Baldwin had the weakest character although I would not go so far as to say he did a bad job of portraying the bad guy of Pan American. Alan Alda (as always) provided a much better ""bad guy"" though in the form of the Senator whose ""witch hunt"" enquiry was torn apart by a determined Hughes.<br/><br/>I quite enjoy long films, but this is longer than most. There are not many films this long that I would want to watch many times, but I think I will be watching this again soon as I was engrossed in the story from beginning to end. It's a shame that film is only concerned with Hughes life up till the maiden (and only) flight of the Hurcules, but if his whole life had been handled then in my opinion it would have seemed a very rushed and crowded film.<br/><br/>Recommended."

I think director Martin Scorsese did an amazing job of showcasing Howard Hughes life as a Hollywood filmmaker and Aviation pioneer. Every once in a while during the viewing of this film I felt as if I hadn't really accomplished anything in life. Hughes lived such a fascinating life compared to that of an average Joe. It is really kind of sad that his phobias got the best of him and he spend the final two decades of his life in isolation. Who knows what he could have accomplished.<br/><br/>As for the performances, they were all amazing. I have never really been a fan of Leo, but I was really impressed with his performance.

","I don't know if this is a spoiler or not so I thought I better be safe.<br/><br/>This movie did have some drawbacks but this is only to be expected with the subject matter. Howard Hughes was larger than life - a long, action-packed life it was! It would be impossible to put all the information into a film twice this length so many things were skipped making the movie a little hard to follow if you didn't already know the plot.<br/><br/>However, the impressions - the feelings - of the people involved (especially HH himself) were incredible!! So realistic! Having dealt with Bipolar Disorder (which HH had) I can only say that if you want to know what it's like, there isn't a better example. The panic attacks, the loss of self, the confusion with the world around you, the awareness of insanity.<br/><br/>What heights HH reached and what greater heights he could have reached with modern medicine! A true tragedy."

","Dicaprio is at best, the most convincing in this award winning epic, during the earlier years. For me he just fell short of the mark, as he matured, there seemed to still be a petulance about his character portrayal, that I just couldn't buy into. I imagine after reading about the real Howard Hughes, that he would have been a tad different, possibly a little more macho. Cate, well she is a hard act to follow, and she really had me convinced that she was actually Kate Hepburn, except in that one last scene where she was at the door pleading with Hughes. I saw that mellow side emerge that is Cate, not Kate!! Overall a magnificent portrayal, no one could of done the job better.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin, of course as Juan did not disappoint, he plays the part of a stinker so well, and Alan Alda certainly has come into his own as well, a far cry from the days of MASH, as I saw no conniving clown, with a big heart in the performance.<br/><br/>Gwen Sefani, hmmmm the less said the better there, I think the smoke lady was more interesting. It did disappoint me to learn that Hughes was a playboy, who like to playboy with boys, Errol Flynn and Cary Grant, that took away quite a deep respect for the overall movie, and I found it hard to see it as an epic with distinction. Leonardo I personally feel, needs to find the more mature side to his character now, and tune into that, his days of whining school boy are not becoming, to a man who could be not just a good actor, but a top of his class actor...Time will tell.<br/><br/>Overall, a fascinating flick, the planes, the corporate wrangling, made for interesting scenario's, but I am not much into blatant playboy stuff. But then again DiCaprio will find it hard to top his performance in Titanic, and that could be half the problem. Enjoyable, but my head is still stuck on the HMS Surprise :)"
"soulurge7","10","0","4","26 June 2005"," Don't get caught up in the glamour; this story has meaning
","Although the emphasis for this story seems to be on the great successes and failures of Howard Hughes, don't get caught up in that. Whoever did research on the personal life of Mr. Hughes had great insight, and I commend writer John Logan for taking this story to a deeper level. He does this through the relationships of the main characters; Howard Hughes/Leonardo DiCaprio; Katharine Hepburn/Cate Blanchett; and, Ava Gardner/Kate Beckinsale. Through these relationships we see what is really going on with the main character. And although some of the scenes may be anecdotal or not based on fact, they probably represent some form of the truth when we search for what really drove Howard Hughes in his pursuits.<br/><br/>If you think that this story only happens to the famous and wealthy, or that it can only happen if you become famous or wealthy, you are not being objective and you are limiting your point of view. Watch the opening scene carefully. It provides a clue to the underlying theme of this story, and the last scene ties the whole story together. In screen writing lingo, that's called providing the story with good bookends.<br/><br/>Even Martin Scorsese was attracted to the story by its opening scene. He has said that when he began reading the script, he did not know what the story was about and became interested in it upon reading the opening scene. If you watch closely, you will see how the main character's view of the world seems to be laid down by his experience from this opening scene. As he grows older, the dialogue that he repeats to himself over and over (internally and externally) seems to rule his perception of life.<br/><br/>That perception is what ultimately blocks any chance of a relationship he might have with women. Whether that relationship is with a cigarette girl or with the famous movie stars of his time, they are all disasters. The only exception (at least in this story) seems to come from the relationship with Ava Gardner/Kate Beckinsale. They both befriend one another by standing up for themselves and what they want out of their relationship while still supporting each other in their strengths. That is called getting real. And what better way to face life's challenges."

","In this fantastic drama about the life of the great Howard Hughes, Leonardo DiCaprio takes on the part of the great Aviator and boy does he give a good performance. The film starts off with Howard at about 10 being bathed down by his mother. She tells him about how he could very easily be killed by horrible diseases.<br/><br/>Suddenly we move to 1927. Howard has inherited his father's small fortune, and has begun making Hollywood films. The first shown here being 'Hells Angels.' From here on in it is the tense and thrilling life of Howard Hughes. Howard starts by dating a range of wealthy and beautiful women, from Katherine Hepburn to Ava Gardner.<br/><br/>During the next twenty years that the film portrays, Hughes becomes very paranoid, and starts remembering all of the things his mother used to tell him. He closes himself off from anyone and just sits naked all day, watching films.<br/><br/>Eventually, with the big trial against him for supposed fraud Hughes shows what he is made of, and walks out of the courthouse clean and ready to live his life.<br/><br/>Some people may remember the Spruce Goose (one of Hughes' WWII creations), he proved it could fly the week after his court-case. It flew only once and flew over a distance of one mile.<br/><br/>This is an amazing portrayal of the downfall of a paranoid schizophrenic, who (on his uprise) proved he could do anything.<br/><br/>One of the best films I've seen all year (including the end of 2004) and the certainly one of my favourite Matrin Scorsese films.<br/><br/>5 out of 5. 9 out of 10."
"bburns","10","0","2","2 April 2005"," Scorsese does ""Citizen Kane""
","Normally, Martin Scorsese and big-budget epics go together like oil and water. When Scorsese does low-budget, small-scale features like ""Who's That Knocking At My Door"", ""The King of Comedy"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", or even the criminally underrated ""Bringing Out the Dead"", no one can touch him. But with over-slick & too-long fare such as ""New York, New York"", ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", ""Kundun"" & ""Gangs of New York"", he has always seemed out of his element.<br/><br/>Yet somehow, ""The Aviator"" works. There are those who say it is only because Scorsese took over from Michael Mann, who knows how to do long films well (i.e. ""Heat"") & who had experience with big budgets & large-scale productions during his time doing ""Miami Vice"" in the '80's. But I think the real reason for it is because at some point, either Scorsese or screenwriter John Logan realized that Howard Hughes was a real-life Citizen Kane, and that any movie of his life should be an homage to Orson Welles' masterpiece.<br/><br/>So the first thing they did was hire an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio playing an adult for the first time) who--like Welles in 1941--is only really old enough for the early scenes, and whose boyish face isn't quite suited for the mustache he wears through most of the film. Then they recreated some of the more famous set-pieces, such as the screening room, the party full of dancing girls and sycophants, the burning of his possessions, the use of split-screen for the more important conversations, and the monologue about losing millions of dollars a year. Then they grafted on much of the plot about a multi-millionaire who spends lavishly upon his passions instead of making sound investments, who drives away the women he sleeps with, who is more feared than loved amongst his inner circle, and who has a powerful rival who brings scandal upon our hero.<br/><br/>Of course the match isn't perfect. Hughes' Achilles heel is not hubris or egomania (of which he has plenty), but mental illness. And the last time I checked, there are no jaw-dropping aeronautical stunts in ""Kane"".<br/><br/>But like ""Kane"", the movie has only one real flaw. In ""Kane"", it was the that the ceilings in the newspaper office were too low. In ""The Aviator"", it's DiCaprio's God-awful attempt at a Texas accent, marring an otherwise brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Aviator"" should be remembered as one of Scorsese's best movies. It is slightly better than ""Goodfellas"" (emphasis on *slightly*), but it doesn't reach the rarefied air of Scorsese's holy trinity of ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" & ""Raging Bull"". Nonetheless, it earns 10 stars out of 10."

"slimjack","8","0","1","7 March 2005"," Soars on Psychosis but Fails Elsewhere
","The dichotomy of Howard Hughes' spectacular rise and epic fall has fueled sermons, books, plays and even an opera. Artists, academics and theologians have found all manner of signs and omens in his story. The Aviator chucks most of this in favor of a glamorous psychiatric case study. You could say The Aviator is A Beautiful Mind gone Hollywood without Mind's inspirational spine. In fact the greatest strength of The Aviator is the tale of Hughes epic struggle for his sanity. When the movie meanders to other concerns, such as his Hollywood dalliances or his business struggles, it loses focus.<br/><br/>The Aviator assumes the audience has a familiarity with Hughes and his world. If you don't know he died a wizened gargoyle after years of madness and seclusion much of the impact of the movie will be lost to you. The Aviator follows Hughes' life from the late 1920's to the 1940's from the start of his production career and ending with the first and only flight of the Spruce Goose. Director Martin Scorsese stops short of showing us the wreckage of Hughes' final years to let our collective knowledge add the requisite shadow over the glamorous proceedings of the film.<br/><br/>The Aviator is hampered by bad casting choices starting with Leonardo DiCaprio as Hughes. DiCaprio is a gifted actor and he does a splendid job suggesting Hughes' genius and creeping madness. However DiCaprio cannot summon the weight or authority needed to play the ruthless tycoon Hughes becomes. His scenes in front of a Senate sub-committee are particularly bad. He comes across like a sophomore sassing the dean. Cate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn, fares worse. Her resemblance to Hepburn is minimal at best and she does not begin to approximate Hepburn's vocal rhythms. While Blanchett gets better towards the end when she all but drops Hepburn's mannerisms, in total her performance was distracting. The actors in less recognizable roles fare better. Particular standouts were John C. Reilly as Hughes' long suffering factotum and Ian Holm as a beleaguered meteorology professor.<br/><br/>Hughes' business rivals are portrayed as outright villains, which is indicative of the curious take the film has on Hughes' career. The Aviator posits the incredibly rich and autocratic Hughes as a proletarian rebel who takes on ""The System"" and beats it by being brilliant, brave and handsome. We even have a scene where Hughes, after spending millions like water, lectures Hepburn's eccentrically aristocratic family on the value of money to those who have none. While it strains credulity to hear the future darling of the Nixon administration wax Marxist, the shocked look on the horrible Hepburns is undeniably satisfying.<br/><br/>The Aviator is one of those films best appreciated on the big screen. It is an absolutely gorgeous movie. The flying scenes in particular are spectacular and the crashes horrific enough to make us understand their effect on the already unstable Hughes. While The Aviator may not be on par with the best of Scorsese, the power of Hughes' tragedy is exceptionally well delivered and serves to drive the movie through its occasional doldrums."

"ajmelck","8","0","1","5 March 2005"," Psychogram of American society fails to offer the correct diagnosis
","The Aviator is an impressive piece of cinema, and shows Scorcese pulling out all the stops in terms of cinematic technique. The film is lush, glossy, glamorous, but beneath this shiny carapace lies a completely different inner reality. Scorcese's earlier work anatomised the darker side of the American metropolis through the broken lives the individuals obliged to live in the belly of the beast. In The Aviator, he takes the life of Howard Hughes in all its technicolour pain and glamour, and offers it up as an iconic portrait of those twin-born wraiths, the American dream and the American nightmare. <br/><br/>Hughes suffered from an extreme form of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), a condition which expressed itself in various forms, such as repeatedly washing his hands, being terrified of dirt, and being haunted by horrific thoughts which would occupy his mind for days and weeks at a time. Equally, he was a man of incredible energy, who got what he wanted, and succeeded where better-adjusted individuals would have failed to make headway. It seems to me that the film therefore suggests that the boundless drive to succeed and to win are themselves akin to other forms of mental illness. What surprised me was that the nature of Hughes' illness was not mentioned in the credits. I am sure that there will have been people in the audience who also suffer from OCD, whether they know it or not; explaining that the condition is now better understood and treatable would have been a thoughtful gesture on the part of the director. <br/><br/>Despite this reservation I would say that the film is a fine one, in large part thanks to the excellent performances by Cate Blanchett and Alec Baldwin, though Leo di C. also turns in a respectable effort."

","This is just a movie that Scorsese made for DiCaprio. After the Oscar fiasco, I thought the Academy was a little harsh on Scorsese, especially for a man who has got 6 nominations in his career, but after watching both the movies 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'the Aviator' I have to say that the Academy was right in giving the former the best picture award. <br/><br/>Why would I disregard Scorsese's epic with such disregard???<br/><br/>Well just like Howard Hughes' epic Hell's Angels was ignored by critics in its early days as depicted in the movie many would agree with The Aviator as well........ The only difference is that Hell's Angels was an epic hit whereas the Aviator would just remain a sideway movie, which people will cease to remember a few days later......<br/><br/>Don't think I'm full of harsh words for the movie, because Leonardo DiCaprio was fabulous..... He tried his level best to pull the movie away, but with the genuine lack of a definite plot, his efforts were mostly to the drain..... Apart from the characters of Hepburn and Hughes all the other characters lacked a proper definition.. I mean Alan Alda was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the movie.... After watching the movie all I can say is that he was a total BS, instead John Reilly was a better option.... The very essence of the movie, the eccentricity of the great Hughes is not very well depicted.... Like Beautiful Mind where the eccentricity stole the show, Scorsese fails to show us the reason for the eccentricity of Hughes.....<br/><br/>All in all the great epic of Scorsese remains as an actor's failed chance to fame. DiCaprio finally proved his acting talents but he put his name in a poor movie which lacks a proper direction.....<br/><br/>In the end a very scratchy 7/10 from me.........."

Ebert & Roeper oooohhhed and aaaaaahed over the crash scene, which certainly gave you a good perspective, however it was not at all realistic: a plane would not simply fly along straight while a wing on one side slices through a house. It might slice for a little bit, but only until the drag pulled the fuselage into the house demolishing both the plane and the house.<br/><br/>The special effects, while outstanding for say, 5-10 years ago, are mediocre at best these days, particularly golfing: the ball looked like the golf ball in the game in the movie Outland, floating along rather than a realistic arc. The water was done better in Titanic, and while it was probably done as a ""stylistic"" choice, at times the movie looks like a B&W film badly colorized. No thanks.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, it was pretty good, save that I don't understand the Oscar nomination for Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, who must be rolling in her grave at the caricature here.<br/><br/>Leonardo does do a good job playing Howard Hughes, but the script is a little disjointed and the movie, albeit long already, ends before it really shows just how far Howard fell before the end.<br/><br/>In the end, I recommend seeing it, but only at economy hour."

","You really can't miss when doing a biography of Howard Hughes, certainly one of the most brilliant, glamorous, eccentric, and fascinating men who ever lived. And for me, Leonardo DiCaprio and Scorcese don't miss. DiCaprio's portrayal of Hughes is a revelation. (I'll digress here to say, for those who have accused him of being short, I've seen him in person - he's not short.) He does a fantastic job as Hughes. You can almost hear his inner dialogue. As for Scorcese, the movie is truly spectacular in its breadth.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in a couple of elements. One was, with the care Cate Blanchett gave to her portrayal of Hepburn, one would have hoped that a little attention had been paid to the casting of the other women in Hughes' life: Faith Domergue, Ava Gardner, Jean Harlow. Of the three, I liked Kate Beckinsale's Ava the best - but for me, Ava Gardner's beauty is unparalleled. Beckinsale really didn't approach it. And Stefani was wrong, wrong, wrong. How hard can it be to find a young actress (and Harlow was 19, not 35, when she appeared in Hell's Angel's), and slap a platinum wig and a white clinging gown on her? Harlow's look was very distinctive, and when it's off, it's distracting.<br/><br/>The other thing I was disappointed in - and I suppose this couldn't be helped in a way - was the telescoping of the years and some unnecessary inaccuracies. I don't pretend to be an expert on Hughes. I've seen one documentary on him which was fantastic, and now I want to read about him. But Katharine Hepburn talks about the press showing up at her brother's funeral - I don't know why that would have been, since she wasn't famous yet. I realize her family was prominent, but she made it sound as if it had to do with her fame. She also labels herself as Box Office Poison way too soon, and the movie skips the entire Philadelphia Story, including Hughes giving her the money to buy the rights. No mention of most of the controversy over ""The Outlaw"" which took several years to see a release.<br/><br/>But these are minor, nitpicky points. This is a big, gorgeous film, with exciting, lush scenes and some fantastic performances."

Hughes later went to form his own aircraft manufacturing company (as a pilot he broke numerous world records in his self-designed airplanes - famously crash-landing one of them in Beverly Hills), purchase and revitalise Trans World Airlines, and eventually pilot the sole flight of the famous 1940s aircraft 'Spruce Goose' - to this day the largest aircraft ever made.<br/><br/>All the while Hughes was renowned for the glamorous Hollywood blondes he inevitably had on his arms, and within an intimate circle of trusted associates, his struggle with mental illnesses - a germ phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder.<br/><br/>An amazing person captured in an amazing film.

It is exalted by compassionate, riveting direction by ""the master"" Martin Scorcese, seamless acting by Lenoardo DiCaprio, who proves here that he can channel the most bewildering of figures, capturing his clandestine ambitions, demands, eccentricities, and repulsions to a captivating tee; a succulent and satirical screenplay encompassing the climate of the ""Hollywood Golden Age"", and some ingenious and meticulous technical designs throughout. The scenes of Hughes piloting his seemingly infeasible designs of aircraft are riveting and stunning, and the searing music of Howard Shore in accompanying these triumphs wings the thunder that is to be felt for breaching the realms of aviation potential. We get a distinct feeling of ambition realized and diminished with Hughes' flights and falls, realized meticulously by Martin Scorcese's majestic scope, like a breathtaking roller-coaster through the ferocious sky. Aside from his aviation mechanisms and propensity for power and perfection, we learn about Hughes' diatribes and altercations against his political and financial enemies, whom he feels ""want to go to war with him"", and moreover, his obsessive-compulsive tendencies and reclusive, manic abjections, which can hardly be understood by the photogenic, torrential public, which Hughes feels busies itself in triviality and scrutiny, while his preoccupation is relentless, yet invisible, ambition. Hughes is presented as exceedingly ambitious and brilliant, yet deeply conflicted, tormented, and crippled, both socially and emotionally- he is a man with many wily ideas, yet a disillusioned conscious, which often leaves him rambling and reiterating to himself, always beyond his psychological control. When he isn't dreaming, he fantasizing, demented, and deranged with the world, exhibiting caprice towards his clients and friends, and unhinged malice towards his enemies who would destroy him, namely Pan-Am and Senator Brewster (played astutely by Alan Alda). DiCaprio elicits much empathy and understanding for Hughes' seemingly inexplicable demons, and here is a character tortured by his own torrential conscience at odds with the scrutiny of the world. Cate Blanchett offers some quirky, zesty talent in the role of the illustrious and loquacious Hollywood goddess Katherine Hepburn, a particular mistress of Hughes early in his career with whom who experiences exhilarating flight and special romance. As a story, this is a challenging study about a challenging and challenged figure in challenging and unparalleled times. As a film production, it's as marvelous, riveting, and a auspicious, working thunderously as a fantastic drama interwoven with some rocketing aviation and gleaming production design, as well as shrewd direction, acting, and dialog. ""The Aviator"" is one of the year's best and most important films, a critical yet complimentary look at a marvelous, yet conflicted figure, and an entertaining and rewarding piece of film that is destined to be appreciated and adored through time, in ""the way of the future""... ""Show me the blueprints"" of Oscar! **** out of ****"
"segratz","9","0","1","31 January 2005"," Excellent Epic Film
","This is a serious epic film, spanning a large chunk of Howard Hughes' life, and highlighting several grand Hollywood actors. I can easily see how it would be nominated for so many Oscars, because in some ways it is an homage to all the films of the 30s and 40s. I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the acting was phenomenal but at times strange. With so many current actors playing such eccentrics, it's hard not to almost cringe at their characters. Example? Blanchett (nominated for best actress by The Academy), playing Katherine Hepburn, can be grating just as I think the original Hepburn was, and her raspy loud voice impersonation made me feel almost...uncomfortable. Of course DiCaprio is over the top, and he is excellent at impersonating all of Hughes' ticks, as well as landing a great Texas accent. He just seemed a bit young for the part, but considering the lack of acting talent today, I can get over it. He was great, and if he won for best actor I could accept that. The most underrated performance? Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner. She steals every seen she is in.<br/><br/>Should you see it on the big screen? YES! The movie IS called 'The Aviator' and there are amazing aerial shots that are better than even' Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow'. I thought they were breathtaking and the best in-air shots I'd ever seen. The more I think about the film, the more I like it. Scorsese does a fantastic job. <br/><br/>BE PREPARED THOUGH! Like all Scorsese films, this one is LONG, and will FEEL LONG!"
"barrygermansky","8","0","2","27 January 2005"," A Great Film Of 2004
","The Aviator wonderfully chronicles the life of billionaire Howard Hughes. Although The Aviator has a few dull scenes, there are far more exciting moments that make you forget about the mediocre ones. <br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio stars as Howard Hughes, and I must say he gives a first rate performance! His performance in this film is his best work yet on screen. He is more than worthy of an Oscar for Best Actor! <br/><br/>The Aviator gives us a lot of accurate information about Howard Hughes, including his phobia of germs. In addition, there is a fantastic scene where Howard crashes his airplane into a hotel! The scene is extremely thrilling and very well done. <br/><br/>Overall, The Aviator is an excellent film that is sure to be a hit with all audiences! I highly suggest that you see this film in the theatre!"
"alan-b-thomas","9","0","2","26 January 2005"," Don't miss it!
","This is a fabulous movie! The story of the rise and fall of the mega-rich Howard Hughes is told with a sure touch, and can be enjoyed even if you know nothing about him (and despite any alleged artistic licence with 'the facts').<br/><br/>The acting is superb throughout. Leonardo Di Caprio turns in an accomplished and mature performance, possibly his best yet. His depiction of Hughes' gradual physical and mental decline is deftly handled, neither lurid nor sentimental. Other notable performances come from Cate Blanchett, playing the peppery Katharine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale, stunning as Ava Gardner, Alan Alda, as the wily Senator, and Al Dubois (?) as the smoothly mannered but ruthless chief of PanAm Airways.<br/><br/>The period settings are wonderfully evocative (the cars, the clothes, the interiors, the street scenes) and the aircraft (WW1 biplanes, an experimental spy plane, the Spruce Goose) are fantastic (if suspiciously lacking in noise and vibration for the interior shots).The scenes of Hughes' crash-landing are both terrifying and spectacular without being an SFX-fest.<br/><br/>To cap all this, the music is tremendous - pre-war ballads, jazz, big-band numbers and, if you stay until the final credits, a blues performance by Leadbelly.<br/><br/>My partner approached this movie with no interest in Howard Hughes nor aviation. But, like me, she was knocked out by the quality and entertainment value of this film. So don't miss it!"
"yndprod-2","8","0","2","26 January 2005"," A Great, Complex, Challenging Film
","This is beautiful, old-school Hollywood film-making infused with life and energy. I think it's hysterical that people are complaining that the film ""has no soul"" -- that was the same criticism leveled at Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" back in '80 (later named the Best Film of the Decade by several critics orgs).<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" isn't a touchy-feely biopic. You want that, go see ""Ray"" or ""Finding Neverland"". Scorsese's films don't work that way. They don't spoon-feed easy sentiment and they don't reduce people to anecdotes. They're complex, challenging and infinitely more rewarding that either of the other two biopics nominated for Best Picture this year.<br/><br/>Not at the top of my ""Best Of"" list this year, but certainly my favorite of the Best Picture nominees."
"rmz","7","0","1","25 January 2005"," Quite a delight
","DiCaprio was awesome... He truly impressed me with his acting!!! and the 3-hour movie itself was quite a delight :) . The movement of the cameras and the quality of the picture takes you right away to the 1930s and what makes this movie more enjoyable is the fact that it is a true story. It am not surprised at all that it has been nominated for 11 Oscars and i am sure the movie will great some of these. One Zero is for the ending, it was quite a surprise for me. I expected to see where did Howard's obsession with aviation take him. As i knew later, he was forced to sell TWA in 1966 and was approached by CIA to recover a soviet submarine in 1972. 10/10 for DiCaprio and 7/10 for the movie."

","Well i've never been much into Leonardo Di Caprio (spelled right?), but well he was good in ""catch me if you can"", but in other movies he just kind of looks like me.. goofy and misplaced in the roles he is playing! Just think he was better when he did Basketball diaries and Streets of New York... But in my mind he actually revitalized himself in ""The Aviator""..! Possibly one of his best performances ever..! I actually didn't think he had this much talent, but i think he really set the tone for further roles in the future.. cause boy, Leonardo much have some one teaching him how to pose with the face with the different expressions..! He really is very convincing in the role of Howard Hughes and i believe he deserves a lot of recognition and pads on the shoulder for this one...!<br/><br/>Great plot and a fat Baldwin makes this movie so true..! Just love Baldwin in that bad ass role, wheres he's not a complete jerk off, but almost.. :-) You cant help to like him anyhow..!<br/><br/>And then last but not least Leonardo..! Forever to come, i will see his movies, for he has truly put me down on my knees begging for mercy on this one.. i cant have a nag against a guy doing a movie so true and inspiring..!<br/><br/>Great cast, great monologues and a serious messed Leo..! :-D<br/><br/>Downsides in the movie aren't worth to be mentioned..!

Beautiful."
"starlasunlight","9","0","2","18 January 2005"," Lengthy but excellent
","Just seen The Aviator and it is fantastic. It is a little long and dragged in places but as so many have said it picks itself back up so you quickly forget the moments you were checking your watch.<br/><br/>I'm still in awe of Leonardo's performance because he was outstanding. He played the part so well with pride,passion and pure heart and soul. I am one of the few that had no knowledge of Howard Hughes. Learning about this extraordinary,clever and interesting man made me realise we are all so different. His obessive compulsive disorder and demonic voices in his head are dealt with brilliantly by DiCaprio.<br/><br/>On the adverts of this film I wasn't too sure about Cate Blanchett playing Katherine Hepburn.She seemed annoying and she was putting me off seeing the film. She was FANTASTIC though and I felt bad for questioning her talent. Kate Beckinsdale and Gwen Stefani are briefly in the film and do justice to their characters.(I'm not great with remembering names whether or not the names are famous makes no difference). The bit where Howard kind of rubs Ava's chest was a little unnecessary. Call me a prude but it's not what I paid to see haha! Overall, I'd give the film a definite 9/10 because it is fabulous just the dragged scenes ( 2 or 3) are a little silly.<br/><br/>Check it out though folks."
"tom_cs","9","0","3","18 January 2005"," The Aviator - best Scorsese since Casino (which I have seen over 50 times)
","Before you read the rest of the review please note that I thought that Di Caprio was a poor actor before seeing this film and that he was made to look totally inept opposite Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York which dragged the film down as a whole - <br/><br/>I have to say it certainly is a career best for Di Caprio. It was quite refreshing to see him not doing a heartthrob role or the hard man (as I don't think he's convincing) as in Gangs but simply a really juicy character with plenty of eccentricity to work with.<br/><br/>A highlight was the Senate hearing, where clearly the scene is designed as a platform for the Hughes character to show his natural intellect and the brashness of his ambition juxtaposed to the inevitability of his slide into madness and he delivered the performance with just the right weight so that it wasn't over-acted but he could still display the characters' commanding force.<br/><br/>As for the work as a whole it was superb, Scorsese's best work since Casino a portrayal of a quite fascinating character who's main adversary to achieving everything he wanted was himself (a similar avenue explored with Scorsese's portrayal of Jake La Motta in Raging Bull). All of the set-piece scenes were sumptuous and impeccably shot, the soundtrack as with all Scorsese films seems as if it was tailored exactly to fit. The supporting cast were very good and indeed Law's take on Errol Flynn was right on the money (would have liked to have seen a bit more of him in fact) and most of all, the flight scenes were genuinely exhilarating.<br/><br/>I see that DiCaprio won the Golden Globe the other night but that Scorsese lost out to Eastwood and I would expect there to be a 50:50 split at the bookies between Scorsese and Eastwood in the run up to the Oscars."
"HardKnockLife210","8","0","1","17 January 2005"," Obsessive Beauty
","Men with the most money get the most attention, especially when they're involved with Hollywood. One of these men was Howard Hughes, a man who faced barriers from without and within. The Aviator does a pretty good job of capturing this man on film, but the movie still has some barriers of its own.<br/><br/>The Aviator does not begin at the beginning of Hughes' life; rather it picks up in the midst of Hughes' production of Hell's Angels. And just like Hell's Angels, there's never a moment in the film that's boring. In fact, all 170 minutes are captivating. There are so many big-names behind this film that one can't help but be awed. Alec Baldwin, John C. Reilly, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Ian Holm. Standing out, though, was Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, eccentric in her performance, but only as eccentric as Hepburn herself.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Scorsese's direction and Richardson's cinematography are both excellent and pleasing to the eye throughout the film. Also, Shore provides a score that captures the excitement of aviation alongside the tragedy of Hughes life. The screenplay, sets, and costumes also seem to fit the time period very well.<br/><br/>Now, on to DiCaprio's performance. Overall, I felt that he did a very good job in his very tough role as a deeply-troubled man whom no one ever understood. However, at the beginning of the film, he just seems to be Leonardo DiCaprio, not Howard Hughes. Maybe this is because the film delves right into the action and the viewer cannot even start to grasp Hughes' character until later in the film. Needless to say, though, as Hughes ages, DiCaprio seems to embrace the character fully and without restraint. One other complaint I have regards a certain transition in the film that I found hard to believe, and it has to do with the mental state of Mr. Hughes, but I cannot discuss it in full here because it may spoil the film for potential viewers.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is a must-see, in turns entertaining and disturbing. The ending is a beauty.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A-."
"The_Orenda","9","0","1","16 January 2005"," A beautiful look at the life and times of...
","Martin Scorsese has done a magnificent job directing the life and story of an eccentric businessman/filmmaker. I think the production has told an intriguing and carefully thought story of the life of Howard Hughes. I recommend this movie to everyone who believe that truth is indeed more fascinating than fiction. The Aviator has dramatized (and, to a lesser degree, romanticized) real life, but the effect only betters the movie. After all, this is Hollywood we're dealing with.<br/><br/>It's 1930, and $4 million dollars later, Howard Hughes has created the most expensive movie yet. The flying Great War epic isn't enough for the young Texan as he plans on taking the aviation industry by storm.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the perspective of Hollywood in the 30s. There's a magnificent view placed in the movie that makes you wonder if you would be looking through the eyes of Howard Hughes if he was in your seat itself. I would not be surprised if Ms. Blanchett is nominated at the Academy Awards. If you're not into biographical movies, then her performance of Katharine Hepburn deserves some notice. Look for cameos by Gwen Stefani and Jude Law. I didn't recognize the latter. It was a good movie and I wouldn't mind watching it again. But nearly tipping the scales at just under three hours, make sure you get comfortable, with your toilet breaks done and over with."
"rudronriver","8","0","1","16 January 2005"," Love in times of fear
","Howard Hughes obtains every girl he can desire easily (if he has any time left amid lathering, aeronautic designing and movie producing), but he discovers a surprising affinity with Katherine Hepburn.<br/><br/>For Hepburn this man is not ""too much mad for me"" as Ava Gardner will tell him later- because Katherine suffers also from some kind of disorder. Both little conventional young of slim elegance, an innate ambition and highest professional achievements, find in each other a companion with features that are not abundant in their respective environments. The similarity between these two protagonists is one of the keys for this film, but few have found it. The main personality resemblance being the predominance of a neurotic tendency. Is attraction or necessity what unites them? A nature dominated by anxiety seems to adapt defectively to other neurotic, although the expression of the anxiety are quite different; he suffers a phobic and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and in Kate although resulting in a less handicapping way- we can guess she is an eccentric person, in constant need for control and easily stressed when feeling that she is not as much loved as she aspires to. Both reach that point in which one interferes with another (""fame is my territory"" tells him, when some of the photographers turn their cameras away from her and aim them to him), but this would not be enough reason for breaking up as she will leave him for another notorious star that could also overshadow her (Spencer Tracy, her definitive love). The true reason is Hughes was not able to satisfy her necessity for security as Tracy would do (anyone that has seen Tracy's movies knows he is the kind of man that was born to give confidence). Neither Kate can render any aid to Hugh (when he is attacked by her family with wounding remarks she does not assist him: who is asking for help is not ready to hear others when asking the same).<br/><br/>Two very similar people rarely could complement each other, but living together is impossible when their main feature is an under-laying fear, that arises constantly from childhood time. The need for a mate in this kind of people derives from the necessity of a truce in the sense of fear, and both will look for that relief in each other at the same time.<br/><br/>I intended to deal only about one of the many aspects of the story."

Go on all you Leo critics: watch The Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, etc etc. the boy can act!! I was critical of his performances in The Beach and Gangs Of New York (which I don't really like as a film), but this performance in the Aviator has won over a lot of Leo-haters, so intense, you can just see how hard he's working! My only criticism of The Aviator is it's too long. I don't know why everyone is making 3hr films nowadays, but I think Scorsese could have cut 30 to 60 minutes off this one, and still told us the story, it drags on and on. other than that it's excellent, it tells the story of genius Howard Hughs who I knew nothing about before. Well done Mr DiCaprio - keep it up! I'm a bit worried about Baz Luhrmann's Alexander, but it could be excellent."

This is not to say that this is a bad film and it would have really deserved it's likely Oscar success had the majority of the first hour been saved for the extended edition DVD.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the early years of Hughes especially his love of flying. His fight against mental illness is also dealt with and most people familiar with 20th century history will know where the story is leading. DiCaprio puts in a reasonable performance in the lead and is well supported by the rest of the cast including the excellent John C Reilly.<br/><br/>Once the film gets into stride it's gripping during the second act.

","I tentatively went to see ""The Aviator."" I'm not really a Leonardo Di Caprio fan, not a big fan of 3-hour movies. I'm very glad I made the effort, and not because I turned around right after and sneaked into ""Meet the Fockers."" The film was shot very nice, although some suspension of belief was necessary for some shots that were very obviously ""fake-looking."" Generally, it was nothing fancy, and only a few things (like flashbulbs popping) were overdone a bit.<br/><br/>The performances were very enjoyable, even to the point where Kate Blanchett was every bit as annoying as Katherine Hepburn as Katherine Hepburn seemed to be in real life. Possibly a bit of overacting there. Di Caprio did an outstanding job as a younger Howard Hughes, and the scene amid the Senate testimony does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The story is an interesting one, and like Hughes or not, it makes me long for days when there were truly ""heroic"" men of vision like Hughes or Chuck Yeager who always sought the next dragon to slay.<br/><br/>You are, however, very aware of how long the movie is. It doesn't really click along. But that time is filled with entertaining material and it's difficult to really point to any one thing and say ""that should have been cut"" to shorten the flick.<br/><br/>I'll be buying this one the night the DVD comes out."
"hcpix","8","0","3","12 January 2005"," A Compelling Story
","It is very difficult to tell the story of someone as dynamic as Howard Hughes. I applaud the director for his efforts and especially appreciated the choice to deliver a movie that did not overstate the obvious (Hughes was wealthy, his father invented the drill bit that allowed drillers to plunge deeper for oil, his eccentric OCD behavioral defects, his contempt for affable conjecture...). In place of all of that the film makers chose to reveal the origin of the man's zeal. His intent to DO things by the force of his own will and by using his money to do it. His failures were not something that could be laid to blame on someone else as often the case in today's business environ'. Mr. Hughes took chances because he had the access and availability to do so which by itself sets him apart from most people. The film took you inside the man himself not his mere accomplishments. I got a sense that Howard Hughes was a man of fortitude. A man who said little to boast his successes but acted on what was up to his challenge and in that I mean the challenge he put to himself each day-to be the best at what he did and if not the best then he would certainly run the course to the end. Is it any wonder he was OCD? I think this film spoke to those who have not lost sight of their dreams and while not all of us will have the great fortune Howard Hughes enjoyed at least the race will never cease to be an exciting if not capricious ride."
"dangerousrich","8","0","1","12 January 2005"," Overall, a good introductory biography to a great man
","I saw a TV spot with the director Martin Scorcese a few months ago and the idea of the film grabbed me. I went into the cinema knowing nothing about Howard Hughes but came out knowing a lot more. The story documents the main part of his career as a film director and aviator and the transition into mental illness. The film does well in portraying Hughes as the underdog against the big boys, desperate to share his pioneering dreams with the world and succeeding.<br/><br/>The film also shows the 'playboy' side of his lifestyle as he woos some of the biggest names in showbiz at the time, including his big love Catherine Hepburn, well played by Blanchett.<br/><br/>Effects-wise the big plane scene was well executed and used CGI to aid rather than substitute the action which looked great.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I'd have to comment on, is the length of the film. Personally, I start losing interest around the 2 and a quarter hour mark and this film came in another half an hour longer. If you're prepared for the length though, there's no reason not to go and see this great film. Others have said it doesn't go into the depth of Hughes' life as much as they'd like which is fair enough but to the average cinema-goer who has no previous knowledge of Hughes and his life's-work, it will definitely leave you thirsty for more!"

There are two things that really worked for me. First was the depiction of his torture and descent into his madness. Haunting. I'll never wash my hands and not think about it. Second was the way Scorsese put you in the cockpit, and captured the feel of being the Aviator.<br/><br/>The Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale roles as Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner were incredible.

Experiencing this film allows you to peek into the private, and sometimes all to public, life of one of the great pioneers of modern aviation. His brilliance as a genius in the world of aviation is shown in balance with his personal battle with mental disease. It as an unforgettable experience and left me wanting more. It is long, but I didn't mind and wished that it had given me more. When you see it, you will understand why I say this.

"the_usual_suspect","10","0","3","10 January 2005"," Blissfully, wonderfully, beautifully perfect
","The Aviator Review by Joshua Morrall<br/><br/>Rating: 5/5<br/><br/>There is nothing, absolutely nothing, no matter how hard I scratch with my unkempt nails to find something, there remains not a single element of The Aviator that is not blissfully, wonderfully, beautifully perfect.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has helmed forty projects, and his lack of an Oscar has been chuckled about in the film world for some years now. It is a credit to him, the five foot film school graduate, that he has remained fully focused on producing motion pictures that captivate the audience, and offer a purity of cinematic excellence rarely seen on screens today.<br/><br/>Scorsese's most recent production, The Aviator, is the life story of the legendary Howard Hughes, huge budget movie director, playboy, pioneer and what many would call a psychopath. Hughes broke boundaries when he directed and produced the war epic Hell's Angels. His addiction to aviation was funded by his mammoth inheritance and profit margin, although he almost lost it all as he became obsessed with producing the most mammoth and modern aeroplanes the world had ever seen.<br/><br/>In the role of Hughes is Leonardo DiCaprio. Any of you who consider him a talentless heart throb should be ashamed of their pitiful ignorance and analyse his almost faultless performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Catch Me If You Can, The Basketball Diaries, This Boy's Life (to name but a few). Here, DiCaprio takes his method to an entirely new level, believable and arresting as both the playboy and the manic. DiCaprio's nervous ticks are a joy to behold, from his nervous cough at the sight of germs to his utter uncontrollable terror as a disabled man approaches him after using the bathroom. Best Actor? Very much deserved.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett, apparently Scorsese's first choice for the role of Katherine Hepburn, is transformed completely into the reincarnation of the four time Oscar winner. The New England accent is faultless, as are the mannerisms and the classy Hepburn swagger. Truly a fantastic performance. Best Actress? Certainly.<br/><br/>Even the usually irritating but constantly alluring Kate Beckinsale turns in a great performance, definitely worthy of Academy notification. She is alleged to have put on twenty pounds for the role and she comes out looking fresh faced and mouth watering. Her chemistry with DiCaprio is very playful, contrasting the mother son undercurrent that pervades between DiCaprio and Blanchett. <br/><br/>Performances from John C. Reilly and the reborn Alec Baldwin are of a very high standard also. It seems unfair to name just two actors when all gave award winning performances, yet somehow, despite the quality of the supporting cast, the leads still manage to have an extra spark that makes the tense moments in the film even more exhilarating to watch.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is clearly painstaking. As the years past, the quality of the film changes also, the colour tones reflecting how films would have looked at the time. The beautifully painted shots are matched by the costumes, set design and even special effects, something quite rare for Scorsese. His old school approach to action is phenomenal to behold, Hughes' crash into the houses in Beverly Hills is an incredible five minutes, the breath taking pace of the machine gun editing (which rips through the screen and tears you up inside) is bettered only by the vibrant sharpness of the real flames, something rarely seen in big budget movies now, who settle instead for the dull, flat fires produced using CGI.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, with stunning sequences throughout (especially the Senate hearing), The Aviator is a beautiful picture with flawless performances, wonderful cinematography and extravagant mise-en-scene. There is no doubt about it: The Aviator soars high above all of the competition."
"DICK STEEL","10","0","2","8 January 2005"," A Nutshell Review: The Aviator
","This almost 3 hour bio-epic of Howard Hughes, the second collaborative film between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio (the first being Gangs of New York), may seem as mammoth as the sproose goose, but with excellent casting, acting, sets and pacing, you'd be clammering for it to continue as it barely scratches the surface of Hughes eventful life, as director, aviator and visionary.<br/><br/>Squeezed into the film are so many themes and subplots, it makes you eager to want to learn more about this fascinating icon, in addition to the Early Hollywood to post-WWII era covered.<br/><br/>Hollywood - this is at its earliest, with classic screen legends brought to life again. The first 15 minutes of the film lets you into the production of Hughes' Hell's Angels, and other classics of his like Scarface and The Outlaw were covered, with the latter's friction with the censorship board on mammaries bringing huge doses of humour. Also, look out for Jude Law's Errol Flynn! Romance - between Katharine Hepburn, played so perfectly by Cate Blanchett, and Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner, who teases and asks Hughes of nothing more than buying her dinner. Minor love relations are briefly mentioned, or given the ""Tabloid Treatment"".<br/><br/>The Aviator - Hughes designs, builds and then test flies his own planes. We get to see him being the fastest man on earth, circling the globe, critically crashing his Air Force's spy plane prototype, and piloting his crowning glory, C-130's granddaddy Hercules.<br/><br/>Corporate Business - Business is war, between Hughes' WTA and Alec Baldwin's PanAm. Watch how they scheme against each other for the battle of the skies! Corruption - Politics and money don't mix... or do they? We get a sneak peek into the corruption and bribery of the early days. Oops, or should I say, generous donations? Excessive Compulsive Disorder - Hughes suffers from ECD, and is obsessive with cleanliness. He uses his own bar soap in public loos, doesn't stand anything raw, or the tiniest speck of dirt on anyone else's shirt. We see the disorder zapping his of his sanity, and he declines into living in filth (the irony of it) and stark naked in his projection room, suffering from the disorder at its worst, before Ava plucks him out of his rut.<br/><br/>I have to admit I ain't much of a Martin Scorsese fan, till now. I haven't watched Goodfellas, and my recent memory of Scorsese is Gangs of NY, and the lending of his voice for the blowfish in Shark's Tale. Here, he masterfully mixes and weaves the themes together into one long compelling narrative.<br/><br/>I have always been a fan of Leo DiCaprio's acting abilities, from What's Eating Gilbert Gabe, to spouting Shakespeare in Bahz Luhman's R+J. This is yet another occasion where he plays someone real and does one heck of a job.<br/><br/>This show has something for everybody, is Oscar worthy, so don't miss it. Now I gotta hit the stores to get one of his biographies..."

","Martin Scorsese has just made another great film. Although some scenes in this film might have been shortened (Hughes solo flights, his relationship with Katherine Hepburn, building the planes), I felt that the overall effect of the film was to convey the essence of what made Hughes tick.<br/><br/>We didn't need to know everything about his childhood or his latter years in this film, it's not a documentary and we can always go to the library to find out more. What we got was a character study of a man who everyone thinks they know about and whose fatal flaws of obsessional behaviours/phobias starting in childhood were the emotional engine that drove him to see things through to completion. His weaknesses were his strengths and then ultimately his downfall.<br/><br/>Hughes seemed to inspire loyalty in those closest to him and although the film is on a grand scale, it seems a very personal story. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes is first rate and sympathetic. Expect Oscars to be directed thick and fast at this movie for direction, cinematography and best male lead. A visual feast that leaves you with more food for thought."

","Eversince i knew this movie was gonna be made, i was so anticipated to watch this - well who wouldn't - when it's got Blanchette, Beckinsale and Gwen Steffani playing screen legends?. Well after all that anticipation this movie was really worth watching.<br/><br/>Since this is a bio-pic the movie starts of with little kid Howard Hughes, as he learns to spell being coached by his mother. After this, the movie sifts to Howrad Hughes being a 24 year old director, on the set of his film 'Hell's Angels'. Well at this point after the first few scenes, when we get to see Leonardo Dicaprio for the first time playing this character. I was not impressed at first, cause to me it seemed to much like the character of Frank Abignail Jr., which he played in 'Catch me if you can' and he was just being typically Leo;i was not impressed, however my opinion was blown away as this character grew, as we then see the hidden spirit in the Hughe's character, played now to perfection by Leonardo Dicaprio himself. It was a brilliant portrayal, thought not still good enough for an Oscar, may be satisfactory for a nomination.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was getting o see Cate Blanchette in a Phenomenal performance as Katherine Hepburn. I have seen many of Cate's movies, and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! I believe it is these elements that the academy should take into account when considering for nominations - the wide variety of roles played. Cate Blanchette was SOOO good - she truly deserved the Oscar.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale played her character to quite the perfection as well. After seeing her in Pearl Harbor, everyone knew she had potential, but after such movies like 'Underworld' and 'Van - Helsing', this has been quite an accomplishment for her. The stuck up nature of an experienced popular actress of the 1940's, was brought out really well, that I was surprised she did not make it with a Golden Globe nomination.<br/><br/>The whole Gwen Steffani playing Jean Harlow thing had me disappointed, when she had only two lines of Dialog. Her appearance however was brilliant, and though there was not much dialog, the camera did focus o her a lot.<br/><br/>Cameo appearance by Jude Law also took me by surprise. John C Reily and Alex Baldwin, may not have given exceptionally good performances, but this seemed perfectly OK, as we were watching Leo, Kate, Cate and Gwen.<br/><br/>Watch this movie you will NOT be disappointed."

","Martin Scorsese's latest work, ""The Aviator"" is a stunning masterpiece. It gives a brilliant depiction of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes as he was in his prime. This film is a complete joyride from start to finish. It is a well rounded character study of one of the most interesting Americans of the 20th century. The script gives us very fine avenues to observe Howard Hughes for the man he was without trying to show us as viewers the morality of his character. The movie is a very strict observation of what it was to be Howard Hughes. Leonardo DiCaprio has outdone himself as an actor. As great as he was in Steven Spielberg's ""Catch me if you Can,"" DiCaprio gives a performance in ""The Aviator"" that is ten times more powerful & fulfilling. Dicaprio delicately captures every one of Howard Hughes quirks and patterns of odd behavior, without making it obvious. It is in the opinion of your's truly that this performance by Leonardo DiCaprio has officially solidified him as one of the finest actors of this and probably more generations to come. Other notable performances were Cate Blanchett, who was near-perfect as screen legend Katherine Hepburn, and the ever reliable John C. Reilly as Howard Hughes business manager. Jude Law was prominent in a brief scene as Errol Flynn. But it is Scorsese's direction that deserves much of the attention. This film at over 2 1/2 hours never has a dull moment. It never drags on. Every scene segues perfectly from one to the next. Hopefully the Oscars will finally honor one of our true film-making giants at this year's Academy Awards. ""The Aviator"" soars to perfection."

","It is always a difficult thing to film a biography without beatifying the subject. In this movie, Scorcese shows us the Howard Hughes, the charmer, the Hollywood maverick, the Aviator. He also shows the demons that haunted and eventually possessed this great maverick! What Hughes accomplished was only overshadowed by what he could have been if he were able to control his neurosis that eventually overwhelmed him. I thought Leonardo gave one of his finest performances of his young career. The Aviator is a case study of one of the 20th Centuries most influential and most powerful men in this country. It also provides a snapshot into his personal life that shows him as a Hollywood playboy and publicity hound, but only to eventually promote his beloved Hughes Air/TWA. But, it truly conveys his real passion for flying and aviation. I strongly recommend this film as one of the better films of the year...if not the best, that I have personally seen! Its a little longish so don't drink too much soda."

Just relax - this is a truly good biographical film in a world of terrible biographical films. Anyone who finds it dull is a compulsive channel surfer who's probably just a few steps away from saving their urine in bottles. The picture crackles with energy and doesn't seem anywhere near as long as it is.<br/><br/>And you pilots and airplane geeks out there are going to totally bliss out when you see this. The five flying sequences are among the greatest ever conceived...only the most committed and experienced wingnuts among you will be able to detect any seams between the real and the digital airplanes. The aviation content is better than 95% accurate, which probably makes this a definitive airplane film, considering how wretchedly ignorant Hollywood is about anything involving technology. Oh, they've pretty much figured out the broadsword by now, but you can count on them to get anything with moving parts wrong pretty much all the time."

","I saw this movie last night and I can't stop thinking about it. The more I think about ""The Aviator,"" the more I realize what a brilliant movie this is because it succeeds so well at depicting the life of a man, Howard Hughes, who was highly complex -- full of conflicts and contradictions, a ""super human"" and a human just like the rest of us.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about Howard Hughes before seeing this film but almost immediately I found myself truly liking him, hoping he would succeed at whatever he tried and deeply sympathetic when he encountered setbacks. In a way, Howard Hughes was very different from me but there were enough common threads to allow me to truly relate to him.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio once again delivers a remarkable performance. He captures the essence of Hughes and is highly successful at bringing Hughes to life on the big screen (an extraordinary accomplishment).<br/><br/>This film is also an affirmation that Martin Scorsese, the film's director, is one of the best directors of all time. I think the team of DiCaprio and Scorsese is perfect. They also worked together on the ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), which like ""The Aviator"" (2004), reminded me of what great film making is all about.<br/><br/>""The Aviator"" also features terrific performances by Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and others.

","This is from Ron in Aberdeen,Scotland,where The Aviator opened yesterday (Friday, January 8). I thought the film was brilliant - and so did my wife - and if it doesn't get Oscars galore there is no justice in modern film-making. I'm not a DiCaprio fan but I thought he was sensational as Howard Hughes and also Alan Alda, Cate Blanchet ... and all of the cast. The real reason I'm writing this is because of the review by Rathko. Movies should be about something, such as love he said! What about Hughes'love of Katherine Hepburn and of breaking the barriers of air flight? The emotional evolution of his characters? Lost me there ... his characters? What was the drive of The Aviator? It's the whole point of the film surely?! There's no theme to underpin them and drive them? Eh? What movie were you watching ... and do you know anything about the real life HH?

Leonardo DiCaprio did a wonderful job of acting, he was very believable as Howard Hughes. And Kate Blanchet did a great job as Hepburn. The movie gave me the urge to do some research to find out more about Howard Hughes. The only reason I didn't give this movies a ten is because it really had no ending. I had to find out what happened to Hughes and there are plenty of websites where you can find out more.

"ElizabethCoral","Null","0","3","9 January 2005"," Wonderful Film
","In a year of very poor movies, all I can say is thank goodness for Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Di Caprio. The Aviator is fantastic. Leonardo Di Caprio's performance as Howard Hughes is amazing...I am a fan of his but this is definitely his best ever work. The Oscar Nom is an absolute certainty. I also predict that it will win Oscars for Picture, Director, Supporting Actress, Cinematography, Special Visual Effects, Make-Up and Sound.<br/><br/>The film magnificently captures Hughes' tortured mental state...his germophobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder is so acute that even a door knob presents a major threat. Once again, I could not imagine that Di Caprio had such a performance in him. The final 15 minutes was for me worth the price of admission alone. Other performances deserve a mention as well...Cate Blanchett is a shoo-in for an Oscar for her spot-on rendition of Katharine Hepburn. John C. Reilly gives his usual excellent performance, Alec Baldwin is great as Juan Trippe and Alan Alda is on great form as the slimy Brewster. And although her performance has been criticised in some quarters, I thought that Kate Beckinsale was a convincing Ava Gardner. I am not a Jude Law fan, but his small part as Errol Flynn was highly amusing.<br/><br/>The Aviator is long and is not for those with a short attention span. But it is the kind of intelligent film-making that is seen very little these days. The cinema I saw it in was packed and hardly anyone moved throughout the course of the film, so there is obviously an appetite for this kind of film. I highly recommend The Aviator."

","Howard Hughes was the greatest aviator in the world. This film fairly depicts his contributions to aviation - and the mental illness that overtook him. Is that illness called ""Compulsive/Obsessive Disorder?"" It doesn't really matter. Great people are (or should be) judged by their contributions to society and not by their illnesses or their sex lives.<br/><br/>The whole film was very carefully assembled to accurately represent the period and the attitudes of persons living during those years. The Acting and Direction were excellent. The sets and photography were near perfect. The music was always appropriate.<br/><br/>For me, this was a 3 hour look backward to the time of my childhood. Perhaps it will not appeal to the young, but ""The Aviator (2004)"" should be seen by all adult Americans and Europeans. It is a film showing the truth about America's part in the technological developments of air travel. Stating the truth about Mr. Hughes private life (and mental health problems) underscores the honesty of the production. <br/><br/>I would only wish that the film had also shown the death of Mr.Hughes. Yes, his end was especially sad, but I think it should have been a part of the film. The end credits might even have mentioned that at the time of Mr. Hughes' death, there did not exist the medications now being used successfully to combat mental illness."

Scorcese's handling of mental illness, his subtle aging of DiCaprio as Hughes and the accurate content of the 1930's and 1940's was superbly done. Thought it took Cate Blanchett a while to settle into the role of Kate Hepburn, but once she did, she was superb. Only one I thought was miscast was Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, but then WHO could possibly have portrayed this wonderful, beautiful and earthy actress successfully. All in all I would still have to give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating, despite these minor flaws."
"DanB-4","9","0","3","8 January 2005"," Excellent Biopic, but Mediocre Scorsese
","Don't get me wrong, I loved this film. And I would be delighted to see Martin Scorsese win Best Director and the film win Best Picture. But for Scorsese, this is (best case) his 5th best film (behind Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Mean Streets) and I will choke a bit if the Academy chooses to honour this after ignoring his masterpieces.<br/><br/>This is an epic film with an intimate feel, in which the director makes no wrong choices. By concentrating on Howard Hughes' life from 1927 to 1947, his glory years before his long and pathetic decent, we get to see the legend and myth of Hughes and not the cartoon character.<br/><br/>As The Aviator opens, Hughes has recently inherited his parents fortune and he seems bent on spending all of it to make Hell Angels, and World War I picture concentrating on spectacular flying scenes. We get to know the Hughes who was a mad risk-taker, a womanizer of Hollywood's most elite and a genius business man. (It is interesting to watch how he succeeds by a succession of near-bankruptcies).<br/><br/>Intertwined with this are brief flashes of the madness to come - his battle with OCD and his sickening obsession with germs. For a drink, he orders milk, in the bottle, seal on. And when he is enjoying his dinner, he is nearly ill when someone picks a single pea off of his plate.<br/><br/>If this film wins an Oscar, it will be Cate Blanchett for her stunning portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. Blanchett brings to life the accent, quirky tomboy behaviour and irreverence that made Hepburn a legend off the screen.<br/><br/>For all the CGI and special effects in this film, its greatest scenes are person to person, most notably the senate hearings. Alan Alda is perfect as Senator Brewster, a crooked politician who is trying to bring down Hughes to advance his own career. Their lunch meeting leading up to the hearings and the time they spend across the table on National TV are the movies best moments.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is one of the great directors for brining out performances and this film is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio avoids many opportunities to overact in this film, and creates Hughes as a complex and puzzling man slowly slipping away from reality. Supporting roles from Alec Baldwin as the president of Pan Am and John C. Reilly as Hughes' hapless business manager, keep the film from dragging.<br/><br/>For fans of aviation scenes, you may never find a better picture. Much of the film's budget has been spent recreating some of Hughes more ambitious inventions and failures. The crashing of his prototype spy plane into a Hollywood residential neighbourhood may be the single greatest plane crash scene ever filmed, not because of the plane crashing, but because of the different perspectives that are shown.<br/><br/>This by no means Martin Scorsese's best film, but it is his best since Goodfellas and it is a great movie. ***1/2 out of ****."

","An entertaining and intriguing introduction to Hughes' life, and another triumph for Scorsese. Very convincing sets and special effects, especially the plane crash in Beverly Hills. Before seeing this movie, I was pretty ignorant about the extent of Hughes' achievements, and this film made me curious to learn more about Hughes. <br/><br/>Only major flaw was the recurring flashbacks to Hughes' boyhood, being washed by his mother, as if to suggest that his mental problems were due to some Oedipal condition. Freud's theory is lame to begin with, and this portion of the movie came across as heavy-handed, goofy armchair psychology. Movie would have been better overall without this unnecessary psychological speculation.<br/><br/>The movie did succeed in demonizing Brewster & the government, and in making Hughes seem like a hero who was standing up for the free market and the good of the consumer. Was it really this black and white in real life? Did Hughes really so eloquently and thoroughly humiliate Brewster during the final hearing, as depicted in the movie? This scene made me curious to learn more about these events."

The colors that are filmed add to the emotion of the actions and sometimes seem like a painting. For that reason, some of the movie may seem slow--my friend thought it was too long. But I thought that the complexity of HH's character demanded length if you want to understand him and the ambitions and obsession for perfection that drove him. I would not shorten the movie. For example, although I hate to fly, I loved the flying scenes. The scene where you are(the camera is) sitting behind Howard as he whizzes up and then down to the runway makes you feel something of the thrill that made him love flying. I will say that I had to find out more about HH, just to see how much in the movie was accurate. Good job."

"gcrokus","10","0","3","8 January 2005"," American Originals
","It is hard to imagine there might be a film released in time for Oscar contention that will more perfectly fit the profile of a Best Picture candidate. In a time when Americans struggle to feel good about themselves and about what makes us distinctly who we are in the view of the world, we are offered ""The Aviator"".<br/><br/>Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a master juggler of interests; it is difficult to sort out whether passions, ingenuity, aggressiveness or private obsession drove him, and perhaps it was all those things. We have always viewed him from the later, more eccentric years, a recluse no longer able to deal with the world or even the smallest mote on a tie or milk bottle out of place. This is not fair, and director Martin Scorcese's decision to key on Hughes in his prime is brilliant.<br/><br/>The studio Internet site (http://www.miramax.com/aviator/) is a nice one and I encourage you to visit it for background on some of Scorcese's vision. There is no doubt he attempted to bring realism and truth to the screen. For a thumbnail on Hughes check out Wikipedia's bio (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes) and if you doubt the severity or facts about his crash in Beverly Hills try http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/XF-11_crash_site.htm for just how lucky and admittedly foolhardy Hughes was  throughout his life.<br/><br/>Scorcese has assembled a fine, if not near perfect cast for ""The Aviator"". Grading out the roles of key figures; Gwen Stefani doesn't come close to capturing Jean Harlow's look and not much is required of her otherwise; so too Jude Law's inclusion as Errol Flynn is a cameo and he just may be there because he was available during a hot year for him; Kate Beckinsale is quite captivating as the captivating Ava Gardner and shows us a nice moment in the latter part of the movie; Alec Baldwin (portraying Pan Am visionary Juan Trippe) and Alan Alda (as Senator Brewster) nail their parts, and both should be applauded for adding real value to the final effort; John C. Reilly (whom we all love but only gets one opportunity to say something of importance) plays a fine sidekick (Noah Dietrich) and Kelli Garner is equal to the task of depicting Faith Domergue.<br/><br/>But DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett really deliver the goods. In Leonardo's case we get the first opportunity of seeing him portray a real man. Flawed as Hughes may have been, he was an American original, the American dream, really, and we are never in doubt that we are really watching Howard Hughes. Leonardo will absolutely rivet you in his depiction of Hughes as he testifies (late in the film) before Senator Brewster's Committee; this is the best work DeCaprio has ever done.<br/><br/>There has never been an actress, or any other woman, for that matter, that looked like Katherine Hepburn. Again Scorcese made the right decision, knowing full well Hepburn's look couldn't be duplicated, to use a terrific actress that convincingly delivers what Hepburn herself always delivered  a class act with signature singularity. No mean task, that, and Blanchett really adds the extra required.<br/><br/>The only moments that did not ring true were fleeting, but the key unnecessary insertion was a childhood memory of Hughes revisited late in the film and is a little heavy handed; I immediately thought of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Rosebud"" and did not appreciate the similarity. Secondarily, much ado is made of Hughes discovering the need for clouds to serve as a backdrop for air battles to emphasize speed, but William Wellman had actually discovered this (and is so credited in several books) a few years previously while filming the first Academy Award Best Picture (""Wings"").<br/><br/>Martin Scorcese's ""The Aviator"" is so captivating that it is difficult to figure how any other film of '04 can possibly be a better candidate for Best Picture. We have, in fact, an American original (Scorcese) weaving a story about an equally compelling figure in our history. And it is all here: the stars, the acting, and the period feel, the cinematography and Leonardo DiCaprio doing his best work ever. This is one that will be watched again and again by the next generation. That is as good as Scorcese could have hoped for.<br/><br/>Rating: Four Stars."

","Scorsese tends to love every single shot lately and really should cut down his movies BIG time. There was a good forty minutes that could have been cut and yet I understand - the art direction, the costumes, the cinematography is stunning and he wants to show it ALL. I felt that DiCaprio gives a fine performance and by the end of the movie, I damn well bought that he WAS Howard Hughes.In fact, I felt the movie was very well acted. The plane crash sequence is one of the most exciting and disturbing and brilliantly edited scenes I've seen in years. I actually felt the movie spent way too much time focusing on Hughes' already well known germaphobia. In fact, I really despised the opening of the film and how Scosese felt the need to bring it back up at the end for a bit of a wraparound. The scenes with Hughes as a little boy being told by his mother about all the dangerous cholera and other diseases going around was a bit too on the head and then really jackhammered home at the finale. But the sequences on his obsession with filming Hell's Angels and the battles with Pan Am were extremely involving and fascinating. I've read a lot books about Hughes but the re-creations of the planes and aviation and some of the battle scenes in Hell's Angels was remarkable."

","The one thing to say about this film above all else that DiCaprio's performance is quite simply sensational. He displays new hidden depths that we had not seen before from this undoubtedly talented actor. One has to say that it was a brave move by Scorsese casting him in this film after he was totally and utterly miscast in Gangs and completely overshadowed by Day Lewis. In The Aviator the opposite was true as I can hardly think of an actor who could have pulled this role off so well. The performances generally are very very strong, with the talented Cate Blanchett worthy of mention. Jude Law as Errol Flynn was also very entertaining and right on the money.<br/><br/>As to the film itself the sheer degree of work and thought that had clearly gone into this production was extraordinary. Time and again Scorsese seems to pull it off with one of the most versatile catalogues of work behind him of all directors. As always the camera-work was spot on from one of the best in the business at this element of a film, as was the choice soundtrack which is certainly another one of Scorsese's directorial fortes. This film must surely be in the running for at several Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>If one had to be critical it was a rather long movie perhaps too long, but this should not detract from its status as an instant classic.<br/><br/>10/10"
"TheNorthernMonkee","7","0","1","7 January 2005"," It'll win at least one Oscar, but there are definite flaws
","SPOILERS Hollywood has changed so much over the years. The glamour and beauty of film starts has faded slightly and Hollywood no longer seems to be a playground purely for the rich. Whilst this is definitely a good thing, films like ""The Aviator"" remind us of the awe dropping beauty of the time. With modern actors playing acting legends, the film could so easily have collapsed into an awkward tribute. Instead what we have, mainly due to Cate Blanchett's performance, modern genius recreating legendary genius. Ironic, perhaps, but never a bad thing.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes is a name most people will probably not be aware of. Those who do know him will probably remember him as an old eccentric in a Las Vegas Hotel Room. Years before this however, Hughes was a rich playboy who dated most of Hollywood, produced jaw dropping films, and created Aviation history.<br/><br/>As Hughes, Leonardo DiCaprio puts in one of his better performances. Often seen as the boy from ""Titanic"" (1997), Leo takes yet another step to maturity with a solid performance as Hughes. Questioned by many who claim he fails to fully grasp the mentally ill character, Leo tries his hardest to show the mental destruction which Hughes experiences.<br/><br/>Come February 2005, the Oscar's will once more arrive with some wonderful performances receiving the statuette. On that night, the one role which MUST win an Oscar, is Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn. Whilst ""The Aviator"" contains some great performances, DiCaprio is good, as is Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, it is Blanchett's performance which overshadows everyone. Taking a well known figure like Hepburn and playing her on the big screen must not have been easy, but there are times that Blanchett makes it look as simple as tying your shoelaces. Copying the voice, personality and movement perfectly, Blanchett seems to almost be possessed by Hepburn's ghost. Despite countless other top notch performances in the past, Blanchett puts in her finest ever performance. She's earned that Best Supporting Actress Oscar and if she doesn't win, then the Academy really are inept.<br/><br/>Alongside Blanchett, no other actor comes close on this screen. One performance worth mentioning though is the brief appearance of Jude Law as Errol Flynn. Whilst not on the screen for perhaps as long as he should be, Law copies Flynn's lifestyle to a tee. In one ten minute period, Law's character manages to not only frustrate Hughes, but he also smokes constantly, drinks constantly, and actually ends up punching someone in the face. Maybe sounding slightly harsh, but this portrayal quite literally smacks of accuracy.<br/><br/>Whilst a masterclass of acting, it is not right to describe ""The Aviator"" as a modern classic. While Blanchett should win an Oscar for her portrayal, the film is not necessarily going to win any others. Director Martin Scorsese definitely has his finest chance of winning his first, and the film will no doubt be nominated for Best Film, but whether these will be deserved or not is another matter.<br/><br/>What is never mentioned about Oscar winners is what the competition is like. In the 1980's, some very poor films won the main award, not necessarily because they were good, but simply because the competition was worse. The fate of ""The Aviator"" remains the same. It is entirely possible that this film might scoop countless awards, but this will depend entirely on the competition. ""The Aviator"" is definitely an Oscar friendly film, but the question remains whether the Academy will look beyond it's flaws.<br/><br/>For starters, the problem with ""The Aviator"" is that like so many other modern films, it is just too long. Feeling like an eternity at times, the film varies from absorbing to repulsing. When Hughes switches his attentions from cinema to aviation, the story stalls and takes a while to get going again. Then at the height of Hughes' film madness (excluding his obvious later life), the true insanity is dragged out to an excessive degree. In effect, the film suffers from this strange Hollywood notion that a film can only be good if certain scenes are dragged out, thus extending the film time by an unnecessary hour. This occurred with ""Alexander"" (2004), it occurred with the second and third parts of the ""Matrix"" trilogy (2003) and it even occurred with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001-2003). It is an annoying habit of Hollywood in recent years, and it needs resolving.<br/><br/>The other major problem with ""The Aviator"" is that it doesn't really conclude properly. Without wanting to ruin plot, the film ends at a point when we really could do with seeing another year of Hughes' life. Not wanting to explore the Las Vegas time is perfectly understandable, and it helps us to actually feel a sense of respect for Hughes, rather than pity, but there surely must have been a better way to conclude the film than the way it was done. It just doesn't feel that well thought out.<br/><br/>Either way, whatever the criticisms people might have of ""The Aviator"", be sure that by February 2005 it will have nominations galore. Depending on opposition, it might even win a few. All it deserves however, is a round of applause, and a Best Supporting Actress award for Cate Blanchett."

","The Aviator starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, John C. Reilly as Noah Dietrich, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, and Alan Alda as Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a dramatic retelling of the life of filmmaker and Aviator, Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Howard filming the 1930 hit ""Hell's Angles"", and goes onto show Howard's career designing airplanes. It also tells how Howard had to deal with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and how the disorder almost ruined his life. Leonardo's performance as this disordered aviator was very well acted, and he could be up for an Oscar nomination. Cate Blanchett on the other hand will most likely get an Oscar nomination, for portraying actress Katharine Hepburn, and might win it too.<br/><br/>Like most Scorsese films, such as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", The Aviator is beautifully directed, filmed, and acted.

"lazarus_ca_48","8","0","3","5 January 2005"," Howard Hughes, from reckless to recluse
","When I heard that Leonardo Di Caprio had been chosen to play Howard Hughes, I couldn't see him in the role. But now, having seen ""The Aviator"", I understand why the baby-faced, perennially young actor got the nod. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the time-worn maxim that the child is father to the man, and Leonardo's looks help to convey this. One particular shot shows just how vulnerable and in need of protection a grown man can be. Apart from his facial features, Di Caprio's acting communicates Hughes' childlike sense of wonder and excitement, and his equally childlike dependency on the maternal figures in his life.<br/><br/>Cate Blanchett plays one of these pivotal women, the late great Kate Hepburn. Once again, I was skeptical that Blanchett could capture Ms. Hepburn's speech, looks, and mannerisms. I am delighted to report that, by and large, she succeeds marvelously, and without being a caricature of the immortal actress. Most of the time, with few lapses, Blanchett echoes the lilt of Kate's speech and the tilt of her chin. The mouth and chin are Kate's all right, the nose somewhat less so, the eyes not at all. (Note to makeup department: Blanchett's hair is all wrong. When it is short, it does not mirror the butch haircut Hepburn sported in ""Sylvia Scarlett"". When it is worn longer, it seems rather too long.) Di Caprio and Blanchett are the luminaries among the cast, but the rest of the firmament is star-studded as well. Kate Beckinsale portrays Ava Gardner as a brisk and capable woman, able to bring Hughes back from the brink of his spiral downward into madness. (I must admit, however, that until I saw her name in the credits, I was positive the actress was Eva Longoria from ""Desperate Housewives""). Alan Alda is equally commendable as a senator from Maine, although I have trouble believing Hughes could have cowed a Senate hearing as Di Caprio does.<br/><br/>But there is another bright star in this film: the script. There is no denying that the cast performs with energy and verve, but it is clear that the script of ""The Aviator"" gives them wings. The script makes it clear, for instance, that Hughes was a math whiz as well as a technical genius. The opening sequence speaks volumes about the relationship Hughes had with his mother, which colors and sets the tone for the rest of the story. And the scene where Hughes meets Hepburn's family -- a formidable collection of intellectual snobs and parlor pinks -- provides a telling counterpoint to Hughes' success as a self-taught, self-made man.<br/><br/>Howard Hughes may have ended his life as a wing nut with a screw loose, but ""The Aviator"" is as sleek and streamlined as his Constellation aircraft, soaring high into the stratosphere, with nary a crash and burn."

","Just saw this. Well what can ya say--Leo is up to it bigtime here, plays Howard Hughes to a T. Quite believable, tics, plane wiz and mogul all in one piece. You know as bad as he was in 'Man in the Iron Mask' for example, when DeCaprio shows up--he can be great.<br/><br/>I won't go into this that much--save for the good parts: Cate Blanchette as Kate Hepburn. Unreal. Nails it.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsdale as Ava Gardner. Very good--Marcia Gay Harden was better though 12 years ago in the Sinatra mini-series.<br/><br/>Flight sequences--Hell's Angels or the Spy plane that crashes or the Beetfield landing--you get right into it and this delivers. Those crash scenes. Wow.<br/><br/>What doesn't work so good? Parade of long-ago Hollywood names-Errol Flynn, Linda Darnell, Faith Domergue--yah Howard had his starlet harem, but I am sure it's a stretch to find many who remember either Faith or Darnell unfortunately. (Who remembers Jean Tripplehorn today, for example? That was 10 years ago....) Martin Scorsese kinda rammed that stuff in a little too fast at times.<br/><br/>The long, long segment on Howard's madness gets hard to watch too-peeing in bottles etc. Yah it's what he became and what he is remembered for now unfortunately--but in the 3rd hour, it does slow the movie down badly.<br/><br/>Alan Alda as Sen Brewster during the hearings-that's very good. I liked that part. Certainly shows Hughes rising to the occasion too despite having his sanity leave bit by bit.<br/><br/>Overall--this should be an Oscar winner esp Leo and that's saying something for me, not being a Leo fan period.<br/><br/>***1/2 outta ****"
"katydid4819","8","0","2","3 January 2005"," The Aviator Flys High
","To make a film documenting the life of Howard Hughs is an ambitious task. Luckily Matin Scorsese is an ambitious man. However, there are dangers to having a big-name director. As is sometimes the case, they feel that their name alone can carry a film. In other cases, most notably Scorsese's Gangs of New York, the Oscar whoring by the studios make the actual art of film-making feel like an after thought. Now it is known that Harvey Weinstein, The Aviator's executive producer, has made it his personal mission to get Marty a Golden Guy. But, fortunately, this does not carry into the film itself.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio found fame by playing off his boyish good looks in movies like Romeo + Juliet and Titanic. In those pictures it did not matter that he looked ten years younger than he actually was. Actually, that worked to his advantage. In The Aviator, however, he is playing a man and not a boy. Despite having a mustache and beard in one part, he still looks twelve. Thankfully, though, this is the biggest flaw with his performance. I'm not going to say that his acting (which is career best) over comes this short falling. I will say, though, that this ""teenage boy"" did a convincing job playing a man.<br/><br/>The Aviator documents Hughes's life from Hell's Angels through his aviation days to the onset of his OCD over taking him completely. The script, although well written in terms of dialogue and character arcs, seemed to skip over the explanation OCD, how it affected Hughes and why more strongly at some times than others. It also playes with his hearing disability, using it only when it aides in a cinematic moment and causes a bigger reaction. When the script is on fire with quick dialogue, Hughes never seems to miss a beat. When he is nervous at a movie premier, he is completely deaf to the reporter's questions.<br/><br/>The difficult task with the film is that it contains many biographical stories. Hughes may be the main one that all the others revolve around, but due to some outstanding work by the supporting cast, the smaller parts are equally as relevant. From Gwen Stefani to Alan Alda, no one is what you expect of them. Kate Beckinsale takes a break form crap like Underworld to show that, if she tried, she could be an actress. Of course, where would this list be without Cate Blanchet, who will finally win her long deserved Oscar this year with a fabulous portrayal of Kate Hepburn; a performance against which all future Katherines will be measured. Once she gets out of the awkward caricature stage she starts out in, there is no stopping her.<br/><br/>Even if it falls sluggish from time to time, the actors hold this one above the water. The actors and the excellent techs, that is. Now if only the Academy would award Marty so that he can go back to making movies where the trophies are the after thoughts. ****/*****"

","There have been few movies that have really ""moved"" me enough to really want to go. However, I have still gone to see many. This one intrigued me, but mostly because it was Scorsese, rather than the subject of Howard Hughes.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling enlightened, not by moral or plot or any such nonsense. Instead, Scorsese had created an almost perfect visual experience. Through pseudo-colorization, well-integrated computer sequences, and a perfect balance between fast- and slower-paced scenes, he had achieved what many movies attempted at this year, but had still failed to create - style. Instead of a simple retelling of a story, which is what many directors do to ""true story"" movies, Scorsese creates out of it a work of art. Instead of simply creating a platform for a story to spring from, the director conveys the art, the sound, and the story all simultaneously. This is something I greatly appreciate from movies. A story can be told through a book, but a truly good movie should be able to portray itself through beauty of sights and sounds in addition to the story itself.<br/><br/>The acting was superb on all accounts. There was no actor that I would have replaced. It was nice that when I was watching the movie, I was able to make DiCaprio not be ""DiCaprio playing Hughes."" In other words, actors were not themselves, but really did seem to become the characters themselves. It was easy to get lost in the who's who of secondary characters, and though he tried to overcome this drawback to the subject itself, Scorsese could not completely remedy the situation. So if you have trouble remembering someone's name in the film, just try to remember at least what their purpose is.<br/><br/>The movie was long, and I realize that will turn away many people. A lot of reviewers and critics have complained that the movie feels even longer than it is. But to me, it passed by quite briskly. Nothing felt dragged out, and it seemed to end as soon as it began.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel like The Aviator deserves more credit than it seems to be deserving. I would definitely go see it again, just to immerse myself in the sense-exciting experience once- again"

","THE AVIATOR (4+ outta 5 stars) Wow... did I just see the best movie of the year? I can't think of anything better... but then again I haven't seen even a fraction of the 2004 releases that I want to. Lately I don't see the point of going to see a movie in the theatre when the DVD release 6 months later is going to be an ""extended director's cut"" with tons of extras and deleted scenes, etc. Plus you don't have to put up with lousy projection, rude audiences and sticky floors (well, okay, me floor isn't always perfect either). However, one of the few directors that I will still go out of my way to see on the big screen is Martin Scorsese. Even though his last few movies have not really been his best (""Bringing Out The Dead"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""Casino"")... even when his movies are merely *average* they are still better than most other directors at the top of their game. The movie's style starts off very low-key... almost like a plain old biopic that any competent director could have made... but, as the story progresses, more and more little Scorsese moments can be detected... and by the end you are totally swept up in complete movie magic. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Howard Hughes. I really had my doubts when I first heard he was playing the role... and maybe he does seem a little too baby-faced early on... but by the end he has the role totally nailed. (One of my favorite movie accents, too... his voice comes out like a cross between Ron Howard and Jack Nicholson.) Cate Blanchett is almost guaranteed an Oscar nomination playing Katharine Hepburn. (You know, I was never aware that her and Hughes had that close a relationship.) Lots of other fine actors in bit parts: Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, Alan Alda, Brent Spiner, Kate Beckinsale and Gwen Stefani."

"cspuria","7","0","3","1 January 2005"," Howard, Leo and Oscar
","This biopic about an eccentric and influential mogul, Howard Hughes, was more artistic than historically accurate, even though the symbolism was so obvious, it took away from the artistic license. Was Scorsese trying to dumb it down for the general public? I thought I caught a glimpse of a bright, blue Ked's label on Howard's sneakers when he was dancing the Samba with Faith. Did Ked's exist 70 years ago? Was DiCaprio really the right match to play Hughes? I'll get to that later.<br/><br/>The over zealous portrayal of Kate Hepburn by Cate Blanchett was saccharin, i.e. sickly sweet. Cate almost pulled off the great face that Kate was famous for, but I thought she could have gone the extra mile and shed a few more pounds to look more the part. By Contrast, Kate Beckinsdale could have gained a few pounds to play bombshell Ava Garner, (Beckinsdale was all shell and no bomb).<br/><br/>Gwen Stephani, on the other hand, was the perfect face for the era which brings me to what I did like - the music, the costumes (minus the Ked's), the cinematography, the colours, the textures - visually it gets a thumbs up. If you like the 20's, 30's and 40's on film, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. If you're over 50, chances are you will really enjoy it.<br/><br/>I read other comments saying that DiCaprio's performance was infantile and that he didn't have enough talent for mature, deep roles. I disagree. He did a good acting job in ""The Aviator"" because he went beyond himself, especially in the scene where Hughes cages himself inside his personal cinema. Although his accent was inconsistent, a personal pet peeve, DiCaprio's ability to play a character with penetrating quirks was reminiscent of Academy Award winner Jack Nicholson in ""As Good As It Gets"", Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and even himself in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". His acting was better than Robert Downey Jr. in ""Chaplin"", to make a comparison. Leo was on screen so much, all but about two scenes, it won't be surprising if he's matched up with another mogul - Oscar."

The other side of the story deals with how this man is being destroyed mentally to the point where he cannot function well. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an astonishing performance ( his best since What's Eating Gilbert Grape ). A message for those of you unfamiliar with Howard Hughes and his amazing life: IT DOESN'T MATTER.

I didn't look at my watch once through the course of the movie, and I was disappointed when it was over. I actually left the theater and went to Borders to find a biography about Hughes, so I could learn more about the man and his life. The casting for this movie was truly inspired. Leonardo DiCaprio will win an Oscar for this performance, and I won't be surprised if Cate Blanchett does, too. Her performance of Katharine Hepburn was amazing. At first I was a little worried that she was going to overact the part, but once the character had a chance to develop, I was captivated. She really channels the famous actress, complete with the clenched-jawed speech, imperious posture, and even the slight tremble. I can't believe that this is the same woman who played Elizabeth I, Galadriel, Veronica Guerin, and Lucinda Leplastrier. The other casting decisions where perfect, as well. John C. Reilly once again shines as a solid supporting actor. I really hope that he gets to be a lead actor some day. Alec Baldwin is a fantastic villain, and Alan Alda is convincing as the oily, corrupt Maine senator. The movie is also full of fun cameos from people such as Willem Dafoe, Brent Spiner, Jude Law, and Gwen Stefani. The story of Howard Hughes' life is shown with amazing directing and cinematography decisions. His early years are very clear, and shown with the look of colorized black-and-white film. As Hughes begins his slow decline towards insanity, the movie follows, blurring the lines more and more between the real and imagined. By the end of the film, it isn't entirely clear what's really happening and what's only in Howard's head. DiCaprio does a stellar job of portraying this downward spiral. I can't put into words all of my feelings about this movie. It is definitely on my Top Five list for 2004, and I will be rooting very strongly for it come February 27th."

","The prior account referenced by this comment was written by someone who obviously felt that expressing his opinions without any basis in fact was better than keeping his typing fingers busy in other endeavors. <br/><br/>While the screen-writers certainly took liberties with some aspects of Howard Hughes life, there is no denying that most of the important facts are public record as they were recorded in the press and broadcast on live television. The way in which his craziness was manifested is also public knowledge and has been written about extensively by many biographers. The fact that they chose to show that craziness a decade before it began to rule his life is why this movie is a biopic instead of a biography. It is a story about an enigma, and they tried to crack the nut of the enigma by taking minor liberties with his personal, tortured times in order to help us see how his insanity both informed his work and destroyed his life. That's the nature of movies. Exact movie biographies DO NOT exist. They are unfilmable and unwritable. All movies are about perspective, and this one is no different.<br/><br/>The acting was, by and large, superb. Leonardo DiCaprio finally made a major movie alongside major stars and demonstrated how versatile and subtle his characterizations can be. Cate B.'s performance was more of a characterization. She didn't need to mimic Ms. Hepburn as strongly as she did. She came off as more of a cartoon than a human being.<br/><br/>The script was also surprisingly superb. John Logan's previous scripts for Star Trek, Gladiator, and The Time Machine were pretentious and meandering. This was tight, smart, and powerful.<br/><br/>The direction, especially during the Hell's Angels sequences, was also superb. There are few like Martin Scorsese who can paint on such a big palette and still keep things delicate and intimate. It is also gratifying to see him return to telling stories about complex, passionate people without relying on overcooked scripts or overcooked actors.<br/><br/>This was a very fine movie. In my mother's words, ""I can't believe he made me cry for a man like Howard Hughes."""
